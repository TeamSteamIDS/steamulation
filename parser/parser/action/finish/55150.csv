												3 years and 1700+ hrs later am still not bored of this game, so it's about time i did a review. Campaign/Single Player - The campaign is a lot of fun and has a great story, plus you will come to see the destrutive power of a single Space Marine and the weapons they own, by fighting wave after wave of Orks plus Chaos Forces. (don't want to give too much away)- The only bad thing for me was the difficulty, hard feels way to easy i've gone through the campaign on hard and only died once (sneeky Bloodletters) other then that it's brilliant. Exterminatus/Co-op - A bit like the Campaign as you fight wave after wave of Orks, but now you can do it with friends plus you have full freedom of which class and weapons you want to use (when you unlock them that is)- You are best playing this mode with friends as some public players like to show off and get as many kills as they can, this tactic is fine until the waves become harder and they end up dying a lot, then when all lives are gone they leave the game (lives are limited and you need them to respawn) Multiplayer/VS - First thing, if you are a gamer that cares about how many kills/deaths you get multiplayer is not for you, due to the amount of lag and sometimes hackers you will end up dying a lot, but if you game for fun then this is perfect for you even if your not W40K fan.- You can pick from 3 class types, Tactical Marine, Devastator Marine or an Assault Marine, each class has different weapons and perks so you can spend a lot of time experimenting to find out what suits you.- There is also an awesome customization feature, you can pick from many Chapters/Warbands or even create your own, you can also unlock different armour pieces for your Space Marine and Chaos Space Marine (so you could run into battle as a pink Chaos Marine with spikes) Overall: This game offers you something new from other shooter games, you can fly around the map as an Assault Marine or overwhelm your enemy with Heavy firepower the choice is yours.Single Player: 10/10Multiplayer: 8/10 Host migration is a pain, it can make some matches unplayable. Thank the Emperor without him humanity would of fallen a long time ago EDIT: 03/05/2015Bin asked a lot lately if mulitplayer is dead, you should be able to find matches for Seize Ground and Annihilation but Capture the Flag, Capture and Control plus Dreadnought Assault are dead for now, but there is a group called  Red Thirst  that gets players together to play these modes so if your interested in joining, the group is on my profile.

												I rather enjoyed this and I must admit, having played a number of Warhammer 40k games throughout the years this is the only one I've gone through that captured a fraction of the atmosphere and ""flavour"" of the 40k universe. It's not something I can easily describe, but clearly the developers Relic have an understanding of the universe and the factions within. For the most part the characters, the way they are written and the way they reacted to the games plot and situations was very .. ""warhmmer""  and it was stronger for that in my mind.One thing this game absolutely nailed was the scale. The size of the Space Marines versus normal humans, the power armour was correctly proportioned and detailed in all the rght ways, the weapons are the correct sizes, the vehicles, buildings, aliens... everything was bang on as far as I am concerned when it came to scale.In truth I can't really fault the game too much. It had to step away from the lore a bit to fit in game mechanics, for example a Space Marine Captain (leader of a 100 strong Space Marine Company, veteran of centuries of warfare) wouldn't turn up to battle with just 2 fellow Space Marines in tow..  armed with a standard Bolter and Combat knife, but that had to be done for progression of course... by the end of the game I had a personal force field (Iron halo), a selection of around 7 different firearms, and a choice between a chain sword, power axe and a blummin' two handed thunder hammer. Not really correct in the world...  but makes sense in a game.The game itself was good fun, melee combat was well done, although an ability to parry would have been nice, and the gun play felt very heavy and dangerous. They got the feel and sound of a Bolter just as I imagine it, bang on the money, and at times I really felt like I was playing a real Space Marine from the stories and board games.The main critism has to be the checkpoint system. Some poorly placed checkpoints sapped a little joy from the experience, mainly the one's that were frequently placed before an unskippable in engine cutscene... which generally pre-empted a major engagement  you could easily lose.... only to then repeat the whole scene again when the you're plonked back at the checkpoint. That wasn't good.However that last point aside, an enjoyable game and glad I finally played it!			",294,55,13,60,16,7,80

TL;DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:We have all seen big men, wearing big armor, wielding big guns and doing manly stuff from previous games (like Gears of War or Star Craft), but have you ever wondered who started it all?Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a Third Person Hack, Slash and Shooter game developed by Relic Entertainment who has constantly delivered quality work when dealing with the Warhammer 40k universe.STORY (No Spoilers):You play as Captain Titus of the Ultramarines, along side his friend Sidonus and the newly initiated Leandros, all of whom are sent to the forge world of Gaira with the objective of protecting a Warlord Class Titan from being looted by a full Ork Invasion. Unknown to Captain Titus, however...other forces are at work there.PROS:+ Visuals (as a whole): -This game boast beautiful cut scenes, epic scenery, massive buildings and intense combat. Model and Animation quality are very well made which is complemented by its superior sound quality. The violence in this game is extreme and oddly very satisfying.+ Audio: -From the soundtrack to the footsteps and  bolter or lasgun fire, Relic has performed admirably on the sound assets which greatly improves the immersion experience. The voice acting delivered by Mark Strong as Captain Titus is great and complemented by the performance of the supporting cast.+ Story: -The game offers a linear story progression which contains enough lore to satisfy the old school and long time fans of the Warhammer 40k Universe, but at the same time, is easy enough to comprehend and understand for the new comers. Story is around 8 to 9 hours long, and 6-7 if you have already played it once. The difficulty level of the game does merit a replay.+ Multiplayer: -I normally don't consider multiplayer because I'm a singleplayer oriented gamer but I was able to substantially play the multiplayer mode of Space Marine and was impressed. Multiple game modes and heavy customization really is a big bonus here.CONS:- Texture Quality: -Although I said that visuals AS A WHOLE is good, the texture quality of this game is quite inferior. It may have looked good on the console versions but on the PC on 1080p, one can see that the textures used was only low res. The poor lip syncing was also a minor annoyance for me. The Artstyle is great but it does not excuse low resolution textures specially on the PC.- Terrible PC Settings: -This game should have had a more extensive PC settings instead of the generic preset of “low-medium-high”. I feel that devs who does not put effort on the settings are not fully utilizing the capabilities of the PC as a gaming platform. On the up side, at least gamers with not so powerful systems can still enjoy the game and have fun.- Disappointing Boss Fight (NO SPOILERS): -A certain boss fight for me was very disappointing since it was more or less a quick time event and mini-game than an actual fight. The fight in itself was still badass and manly as hell with regards to the story though.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME, extremely fun and satisfying to play with a very enjoyable singleplayer and multiplayer experience.WORTH IT?:The game is well worth its full price for not just the fans of the Warhammer 40,000 universe but fans of 3rd person action games and new comers to the franchise alike.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												The epitome of Warhammer 40k in a third-person format, done completely right.+ Solid storyline befitting the WH40K universe.+ Solid mechanics that seamlessly flows from shooting to melee.+ Excellent thematic carry-overs from the written word of WH40k depicted in videogame format. Boltors feel *exactly* like how they're supposed to. Visceral combat feels exactly like how its depicted in the lore, etc.+ Pacing that leads from one segment of the Adeptus Astartes to another easily.- You dont get to play anything more than Space Marines.- Multiplayer is basically Horde mode vs Orcs, or Space Marines vs Chaos Space Marines. Great, but nothing more.			",137,26,4,10,13,2,6

												Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a third person hack-and-slash set in the beloved Warhammer 40k sci-fi universe. It's a worthy addition to the RTS video games that the franchise is known for. The gameplay is simple and intuitive with easy to control shooting and sword fighting mechanics. The game is linear but not to it's own detriment. It uses the linearity to create a unique action game that puts you right into the boots of a Warhammer Space Marine fighting against the legions of Orks.The campaign is fairly short, and it has it's quirks some of which can become quite grating as the game progresses. A part from that the game truly delivers in all other fashions that an action game and more importantly a Warhammer game should. Brutal action, satisfying kill animations, and a fairly well developed multi-player experience really makes the game the complete package. It's game that's worth playing, and it's unfortunate that it got overlooked by many people.The multiplayer with its coop wave based game mode titled ""Exterminatus"" is one hell of fun experience that will give you many hours of fun.

												A highly under-rated entertaining action game.Pros  -The 40k universe is well pictured and as expected revolves around the unsubtle epicness of the franchise.  -The RPG elements nicely supports the action part of the game, rather in-depth visual personalisation and decent class/ability/perk unlockable system  -Great multiplayer in all its variants, co-op arenas, tdm, ffa etc.  -The gameplay action and feel of power is just brilliant and makes all the fun, especially in multiplayer.Cons  -Although a decent one, it is still a console port with all it entails. Console menus, low res texture & poly count, below standard LOD and few graphic options.  -The one most let-down for everyone and a deal breaker for a lot of people, there is no support whatsoever for DEDICATED SERVERS. Be warned for some (if not most) multiplayer sessions are plagued with latency issues, desyncs and host migrations.Get it cheap now, hop in and enjoy yourself. It still has an active community.

My Warhammer 40k: Space Marines ImpressionsStory:Set in the vast and deep Warhammer Universe, you take role of Ultramarines Captain Titus - extremely well voiced by Mark Strong - and are immediately sprung into a war on global scale when Orcs attack a planet. Which planet? No need to know since it matters not. As an Ultramarine you are not supposed to ""ask question"", let alone ""question orders"". Not that it would change much to be honest as I couldn't tell you the name of the planet if I wanted. Anyway, soon you learn that scientists have managed to encapsulate the mythical warp energy and all kinds of monsters are now throwing their bodies like blood-filled waterbaloons to secure this for their respective faction.A deep, long-standing lore as Warhammer's would surely put many devs in a peril to cram at least the important parts into a game one would think. Unless you don't even try. Which is the case here. You won't hear where you come from, why you fight, who the factions are or the characters. Nothing. But then again, as an Ultramarine you ought to fight for the Machine Gods (whoever them might be). Don't ask questions, there is only WAR. Gameplay:It is a third-person-shooter with a very hefty dose of melee combat thrown in for good measure. It is in no way an afterthought though. In fact many times you will realize that brawling your way out of combat is the better choice. Very good that the variety in melee weapons is formidably well as to classic weaponry. Speaking of, you start with only a pistol and add a rifle shortly to your arsenal. During the ~7 hours you'll play the campaign there will be frequent and steady additions to it. At the half-way point even glorious energy-type guns. These especially feel fittingly powerful against the huge hordes of orcs rushing at you during the constant barrage of firefights. Make no mistake, this game is about shooting things and it does not stop until the credits keep rolling. It is refreshing to feel extremely overpowered at times. Movement shows this too as you feel like a walking tank with humongous armor. A tad slow but it conveys the feel of heaviness nicely to the player.One very clever mechanic about combat is melee as mentioned before. Apart from just being a very powerful type of attack, it also serves as the only way to heal yourself - which might sound weird at first. It works like this. After putting your an enemy into a staggered state you can kill it with a gratuitous finishing move and regain a good portion of your health-points back. It is a refreshing mechanic which leads to an extremely offensive playstyle. Don't come into this when you like planning and cover. It's full frontal combat. Set-pieces and sweet jet-pack sections give you nice amount of variety as well.Verdict:Space Marines is a good game with very satisfying combat mechanics. To my disappointment did the devs not put any priority whatsoever into showcasing the deep Warhammer lore. A big shame as this lack of knowledge makes you care significantly less about characters and events unfolding. Why would I care about the machine gods, the imperium, the codex when I never get to learn more about them? There is huge potential with the lore but it was wasted here sadly. The story as well looses importance with this. A very rudimentary construct keeping me go from level 1 to level 2 at best. In the end I only wanted to get to the next area to bash some orcs head. While being the weakest link of the game it only emphasizes how well the actual gameplay is to make me enjoy playing until the end. Ultimately I am glad I played this game.			",456,119,8,39,40,3,51

												Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a 3rd person shooter based in the (suprise!) 40k universe.I've played several Warhammer 40,000 video games. Some were good, others mediocre, and others were so great that I still play them, even several years after their release.This is one of them.This is one of the best 40k games, period. It nails everything- from what makes a good 3rd person shooter, to what makes a true-to-lore 40k game. To start off, This isn't your standard 3rd person-totally-not-gears-of-war game. Whilst most 3PSs focus on a cover system, Space Marine removes that entirely. You ARE the cover. You can wade into a mob of enemies, without dying every 3 seconds. It perfectly encapsulates what makes a space marine a space marine, and lets you experience that firsthand.The combat is divided into two parts- ranged and melee. You are given a wide variety of weapons to slaughter your enemies in different and uniquely brutal ways. Each weapon feels (and sounds!) exactly how it should. The shot of a bolter, the hiss of a meltagun, and the roar of a plasma cannon. And although the ranged weapons are cool, the melee weapons are even better. Chainswords (chainsaw-swords) evicerate and rend flesh whenever they strike, turning a large horde of orks into a bloody mess very quickly. Thunder hammers, although slow, deal tremendous damage and completly pulverise your enemies. The combat (especially in single player or the horde-mode) is immensly satisfying and one of the best parts of the game.The game has both a single-player and a multiplayer. The single player has a decently lengthy campaign (10-12 hours) with a pretty good story. It does have its faults (unfinished story arcs that will probably never get finished b/c r.i.p THQ), and the last boss fight is pretty lame. The multiplayer, although good and reasonably well balanced, gets repedative with the 4 maps (excluding expansions). You also can't choose which side you are on pre-match, meaning you might not even get to see your shiny new color scheme for a couple matches. The multiplayer also follows the standard 'level up to improve' philosophy, with special perks unlocked by completing challenges (some of which are brutally difficult without help). Overall, this is a fantastic 40k game that really makes you feel like you are playing a space marine. It has a few issues (mostly with multiplayer), but you can easily get many hours of enjoyment out of this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warhammer 40,000 lore has had a long history and has served as the progenitor for many of our modern interpretations of ""Space Marines"". Surprisingly Relic Entertainment's Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is our first time actually playing as a Space Marine outside of the strategy genre recently, but this entry certainly makes up for any previous lacking of action games. The gameplay of this third-person shooter perfectly captures the spirit of being a 7-foot armored titan, wading into your foes with sword and axe just as effectively as you bring them down with a hail of gun fire.Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine tells the story of Captain Titus of the Ultramarines and it's up to him and his battle brothers to secure key assets on the Ork-invaded forge world before the rest of the fleet arrives to retake the world. Titus is joined by a pair of AI controlled marines, Sidonus the veteran sergeant, complete with scars, and Leandros, only recently elevated from novice, who still fervently clings to the Codex Astartes rulebook. Eventually the forces of Chaos, comprised of traitorous Space Marines, Imperial Guardsmen and Daemons, also jump into the fray to further complicate matters. If all of these terms leave you scratching your head, Space Marine isn't here to drop decades' worth of tabletop backstory on you. For fans of the series it will be enjoyable immersion with lots of little details and call outs, but even if you don't know what the Codex Astartes is, Space Marine does a good job of laying in enough context for you to get the gist.Overall, the story is enjoyable and will continue to compel you to want to play more, and Mark Strong lends a calm and commanding voice to Captain Titus. There are some great epic moments like jump-packing onto an Ork ship, a massive aerial battle as you race to reach a key location first and fighting down a bridge shoulder to shoulder with squads of space marines. The overall story arc does ring annoyingly similar to previous Warhammer 40,000 videogame narrative structures, i.e. Orks invade, Space Marines are sent in and then Chaos gets involved. The fighting is spectacular though as Relic Entertainment nails the feel of being massive armored death dealers that are equally skilled with ranged combat as they are in melee, and the third-person camera transitions seamlessly between the over the shoulder weapon firing and pulling away for melee. The game actually rewards and requires you to mix it up with chainsword and other deadly close combat weapons rather than keeping your distance. While you have a regenerating shield, your health can only be refilled by executing foes. This promotes a style of play that really hasn't been seen in the third person shooter genre, forgoing cover to take the fight to the enemy, but it is an excellent fit for the Space Marines.All of the elements of animation, visual cues and sound design come together incredibly well considering this is Relic's first venture in the genre. The game does an excellent job in spacing out gameplay mix-ups as well, just when you think you might have had enough of fighting waves of enemies there might be a section where you fire a turret from a train at a drop ship or the game lets you take the fight vertical with a jump pack. The sections with this rocket jet pack are especially satisfying as you crash into the ranks from above in massive shockwaves just to rocket back into the air to do it all again. There is no fuel to worry about and you'll have the jump pack until you finish with that section, so use it to your hearts content. When Titus inevitably removed the jump pack as the game moved towards the next level, I was always a little sad and wanted it to continue because those sections are way too much fun.Once you've gotten a feel for the game in the single player campaign, you can jump into Space Marine's multiplayer mode. With Space Marines being able to take quite a bit of punishment, the overall feel is much weightier than the modern military shooter trend, with sustained accuracy tipping the balance more in importance than pure reflex. As you level up and complete challenges you'll unlock new weapons, armor and perks. Regrettably, the balance does start to feel a little off with some of the unlocked weapons and perks, especially in relation to what you start with, but you always have the option to copy the load out of the person who killed you.The coolest aspect, especially for fans of Warhammer 40k fans, has to be the armor customizer. It's certainly the most robust system to date short of breaking out the paint set and miniatures. You can easily get lost in mixing and matching the unlocked individual armor sections, changing symbols and adjusting the paint scheme on each piece. There are also a number of pre-generated Chapters and Warbands, so it's easy to jump in if all you want is it to represent your favorite force. If you are a fan of Warhammer 40,000 you should pick up Space Marine. Even if you're unfamiliar with the lore, Space Marine can still be a fun romp.			",2260,866,87,236,310,22,349

												""Succes is measured in blood, yours or your enemies"" - Captain Titus, Space MarineAn epic game set in the Warhammer universe where for the first time you play in a third person persepective and face an on slaught of Orcs and other minions.  This game is a must have for any fan of the series and for action fantasy fans a great addition to the Steam Library.  If you have played any of the Warhammer 40K series RTS you owe it to yourself to play this game at get a new angle at the world or W40K.Warhammer Space Marine features some top noth graphics (for 2011) and rag doll physics that are just awesome to see.  The screen can get overun at times with all the orcs and baddies that the Space Marine must attack - and this he does well - the carnage is gruesome and enjoyable.  I really loved all the unique weapon upgrades you could obtain and Fury Mode kicks some major A$$ for when you need it most.  Warhammer sports a moody soundtrack and audio that seems to come from the depths of hell at times... needless to say that it always seems to fit the mood at the right time.  ""Humans to kill"" The Orc banter and dialogue I thought was rather good and comical at times.The game boasts a sporty/meaty on line package where you can do co-op, on line play & off line single player challenge mode.  The on line that I played was a blast working my way to level 6 and blowing away orcs was adventurous and rewarding.  There are endless customization items and loadouts available for your on line character once you start leveling a bit.  If you plan on doing off line challenge mode it is basically similar to Horde Mode - which everyone knows about now a days.I just really enjoyed this game & it makes me miss THQ - they released good games - Warhammer, Red Faction, Stalker Saints Row... plenty of others.  This is a game where from what I seen you can pick up a few missions here and there or a little on line play for your fix of Warhammer.   There are collectables scattered around the game world where you can collect these items for further insight to the game and achievements as well.I truly hope to see a Space Marine 2 as Captain Titus at least deserves another round of Orc Onslaught after this under rated game has captured a place in my top gaming experiences on the PC.  Recommended peeps - pick it up.			",273,36,11,23,17,1,37

												What I always liked about this game was the simplicity of the experience. You're a Space Marine. There are orks. You kill orks. For the Emperor. If you don't already know Warhammer 40k, here's the deal: 40,000 years into the future, the human Imperium worships their God-Emperor (he didn't exactly want the job of being called God), and spans a million worlds. There's several alien species which would be happy to exterminate humanity (and each other), as well as a sort of parallel-dimension-spirit-world that can corrupt things on this side. In this, you play as a Space Marine: A genetically and surgically augmented supersoldier who can live for centuries (but will probably be killed in battle before then), and has some thoughtful extras like three lungs and two hearts and their skeletal growth includes their ribcage fusing into a essential a solid sheet for better organ protection. Then they're put into armor that makes them even stronger and faster. Right, you play as one of them. And you're given a gun that shoots small rocket-propelled grenades designed to penetrate then explode inside the target, and given a chainsword (that is, a chainsaw with a hilt).Gameplay switches between God-of-War-esque Beat-em-Up action and over-the-shoulder-shooter very smoothly, and it needs to; you'll run into mixed groups of ranged and melee enemies pretty quickly. Difficulty is a surprisingly natural curve, too. You'll see enemies who need specialized moves or combos to defeat--you might encounter one by itself the first time, and then after that you'll run into a group of three or four. As the game goes on, things escalate and early-game enemies aren't ever quite obsolete. Another nice touch is your health regen is accomplished by doing execution-type kills on stunned enemies. There aren't health pickups; if you're on low health you have to charge something and prove hard enough.This is one of those definite ""grab it on sale"" games. Gameplay is simple, but it's fun and challenging.			",89,19,0,19,8,1,5

												Space Marine is a spectacular game. The graphics beautiful and they clearly show the the people who moddled this game took a lot of time and effort on this game. In the campaign I liked to spend 5 minutes sometimes just to admire the scene.  THere aren't many games out their that have been given as much time and effort to make the background so inspiring and so real life. Not only it shows the Imperium of man in the 41st millennium have such skilled builders like described in the books, but also shows how much potential moddlers can achieve when creating the game people are going to play.The combat system is amazing. When first I heard about a 3rd person shooter for warhammer 40k I first thought it was a mistake and it should of been a first person. But I'm gladly they didn't make it a first person shooter, because if so the game would of been completley different. Not only it allows you to see background the full scale of the war, but also the executions you just can't stop loving. Every close combat weapon have there own executions for different scenarios of combat and for both Orc and Chaos as well as the Chaos deamons.The campaign is a thrilling adventure which you can't stop playing until you have to force yourself to take a break. Like some books that have such cliff hangers on every chapter you can't stop reading, for example: Percy Jackson. There are scenes which hold your breath because you don't know where the squids will come from (little Orc kamikaze peach dogs that go up to their enemies and explode in front of their face) as your in a tight spaced sewer that the Orcs use to get into places. You don't know if they'l go up behind you or not and if they do then they can make you jump resulting in you getting killed sometimes, (which happened to me a lot in one of the chapters). There are also very happy ending like you finnaly beating the Orc warcheif and stop having to fight with the orcs.There are two bosses in the game: The Orc Warcheif and The Chaos Prince, who both have their own combat moves which you have to get fiqure out and make a plan how to counter them. There is only one sidequest in the game: to collect all servo sulls. It's not necessarily quest because no-one gives it to you, but there are to achivements if you collect servo skulls. And each servo skull is reward. Hint: It's something to do with Imperial Guard the and the people when the Orc Invasion struck. After you finnish the campaign, you really want to go and start playing online. There are 2 gamemodes: Versus and Exterminatus.Versus contains different gamemodes where there 2 teams against each oother: seize ground, annihilation, capture the flag, and a dlc gamemode: Drednought.Seize ground is where there are 3-4 control points and both team have to hold and defend control points from the enemy team whilest treing to capture the enemies. Each control point you hold gives you points unless the enemy have captured more control points than your team.Annihilation is where both teams try to be the first to get 41 kills.Capture the flag is where both teams have to defend their own flag and capture the enemies flag 3 times.Drednought is where both teams battle out to be in control of a drednought. At the start of the game or whenever a drednought is destroyed there will only be on capture point. The team who capture it, one of their players will become a drednought. That team has to captaure as many points as possible until reaching 20 points, whilest the other team try to destroy the drednought and dfending the control points.Versus also contains weapon and armor challenges. Whenever you complete enough weapon points for a specific weapon, you get a weapon perk for that weapon. If you complete enough armour challenges, you get different armour parts available to you for you to use.Exterminatus is really fun. There are a max of 4 players in a single game, where they need to work as a team treing to survive waves of Orcs or Imperial guard or Space Marines. There are 2 exterminatus gamemodes and 3 maps. Each map contains 4 arenas and each arena contains 5 waves. The 4th arena however has a bonus round.Classic gamemode is where your team are the Space marines and you fight waves of Orcs. On the Bonus round you fight a wave of Chaos marines and Chaos deamons. There are 2 maps for this gamemode.The Chaos Unleashed is a dlc gamemode where your team are the Chaos marines fighting waves of Orcs, Imperial guard and Space Marines. The Bonus round is where you fight massive swarm of Orcs who have the help of Killa Kans.You can customise your own character who can achieve you the maximum level of 41. Each level grants you a reward. The character is either Chaos or Space marine depending on the gamemode. You only have one online character who can equip different loadouts you can customise. There are 3 classes for online: Tacticle, Devestator (Heavy), or Assult. Each loadout contains a class you can pick. The options are yours. Use which ever weapons you like best for different classes and their perks.    You can customise how you Space Marine and Chaos Marine lookes as well. You can choose chapter set, or make your own set. Most armour parts will be locked until you unlock them in Versus mode by completing the armour challenges. But if you want something more Vertren then you can buy some skins, which are very cheap.The DLC are worth getting. The Chaos Unleashed unlocks new maps for Versus and a gamemode for Exterminatus.The drednought unleashed gives you extra maps for Versus and a new gamemode for Versus.There are a whole selection of VErtren skins you can buy and customise your character with.And there are 3 dlc weapons. In my opion the whole game is worth the price and all of the DLC's. Although I recommend you buying only one Vertren Skin set for Space Marine and Chaos Marine since you can only use one at a time. But the choice is yours.			",113,18,2,14,17,1,35

												A fantastic representation of being a Space Marine in the 40k universe, although it lacked some of the elements i would have expected like RPG mechanics and deep single player customisation i thoroughly enjoyed the aggressive brutal combat and the proper representation of being a space marine.Relic have produced a visually stunning accurate representation of the 40k universe, the graphics while lacking ultra-high resolution textures and great and are sufficiently good looking. The animation feels weighty and powerful, even just walking around you can feel the heft and sheer Mass of the warrior you’re playing as. If you have ever wanted to take control of a Space Marine, the true space marines of sci fi I might add, this is the game for you.While multiplayer lacked depth it is a fun distraction, the customisation on display here is pretty great too allowing you to play as any of the chapters you like and even make your own. Im annoyed allot of the options such as the power sword are behind micro transaction DLC but overall the multiplayer is prey fun.I really hope relic get another chance with this IP, I would love to see a sequel.

Posted: November 15, 2014
												So I was looking through my list of owned games and realized I don't have anything with a hero or main protagonist as incredibly badass as Captain Titus from Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. I then made a ranking: second place is tied between Batman and Strider Hiryu while fourth place goes to the Boss from Saints Row the Third who narrowly edges out The Overlord for possessing better minions. This list isn't up for debate nor is it the topic of this review, though. The topic is how playing such an overpowering character can be an experience in itself. You are for all intent and purposes a giant superhuman walking tank whose main weapons are a fully automatic mini-rocket launcher and a chainsaw sword. You fly around on a rocket pack coming down with a hammer that produces an explosion of concussive force. You heal yourself in the blood and guts of your broken opponents. You can literally run through some of your lesser enemies. None of this makes the game a cakewalk: orks will mob you relentlessly with their oversized choppers, chaos forces have access to plasma cannons and there are always monsters greater in size than you. It doesn't matter. Being such a superhuman badass just pushes you to greater acts of heroism. The gameplay is basic but enjoyable enough: fire those bolt shells, melee the shooters, dodge roll a lot, throw a grenade into that mess of orks, use the Rage gauge before you die... The difference is that being in control of Captain Titus makes all of this so satisfying. There is weight in your run. The ground thumps as you do your dodge roll. Your bolter feels like the mini-rocket launcher it's supposed to be and not some standard machine gun. The execution scenes are barbaric, gruesome and as bloody as any Mortal Kombat Fatality. It enhances the gameplay, giving every one of your actions greater impact. At this point, I should state that no knowledge of the Warhammer 40K lore is required to get into Space Marine. What more, if by some strange circumstance you're a Warhammer enthusiast or a lapsed fan who has not yet bought the game, I can honestly say that THQ have written an Ultramarine Captain better than the current in-house team of writers. Again: the story is basic enough in a ""save the empire"" kind of manner but it's the glorious yet still humble Captain Titus who draws you in. This is actually the main shortcoming of this game. Outside of the main story you have Multiplayer Mode WHERE YOU DO NOT control Captain Titus, playing instead as a bog standard space marine. Instead of orks you face other space marines where you'll find yourself dying in seconds to lascannons, meltaguns and insta-kill thunder hammers; often with no knowledge over how you could've prevented your death. Unlike story mode, you die A LOT and obtaining perks that would increase the effectiveness of your weapons is a frustrating experience. You will lag, you will get stuck in walls and you won't want to play again. Exterminatus is an improvement and basically Co-op mode where you take on wave after wave of orks along with your friends. It's fun in a mindless slaughter sort of way but it's also a shame how the important perks needed to improve your space marine's weaponry cannot be unlocked here. It's the random challenges you'll hate the most, however. Imagine a spontaneous message tasking you to execute five headshots during a lull in the fighting where no orks are present. It just goes to show how far good but limited gameplay can go in keeping a player interested in his carnage when you'd rather play Titus with all his added abilities than chance a game with overall the same controls in a casual pick-up game of Multiplayer.Overall; the gameplay and the controls are enjoyable enough, Captain Titus pushes all this over the top and the Multiplayer isn't worth it. Therefore, I recommend that you buy the game whenever it is at half price and ignore all of the DLC. Half price for half a product. A Thumbs Up at over 50%.			",62,3,0,4,1,2,13

												This game has aged surprisingly well considering I last played it on console.It's also still tough as Hel on any difficulty, since health packs only exist mostly in the form of giant Greenskins who are usually going around in packs of at least 5.Combat is still satisfying as all heck though, ranged weapons feel satisfying to fire, and jumping into melee after softening up the foe with Bolter fire, Chainsword/Power Axe swinging makes for some damn fun times.One issue though, is the camera is a bit slow, even with sensitivity turned to 100, and since some scenes need you to flick around fairly fast and drop certain foes before they misplace your colon, you can end up on the backfoot fairly quickly.Such instances are thankfully rare, and over quickly, so I myself wouldn't call that a major issue.Multiplayer is barely alive, mainly it's the same 'elites' who are all maxed level and such, so public games tend to be fairly unbalanced which is a shame since the multiplayer in this was always rewarding to play.It's still there though, that at least is good.Exterminatus, co-op last stand-esque is more alive, which is better, since there's something majorly enjoyable about 4 Marines slaying hundreds of Orks across the battle-stained maps in jolly co-operation.Considering the age of this game, the price is fairly high for some parties, so I would say wait for a sale before purchasing ideally, unless you really like 40k, in which case, splurge.Emperor be with you, and may your aim be true.

			IGN gives its video review on the new game Warhammer 40K: Space Marine. Does the new SciFi shooter live up to the Warhammer 40,000 title?		

A very good exercice for the ones like me that have a stressfull job, its action from the get go until the end, its a diferent gameplay in the Warhammer universe, but i think the main objective was acomplished, deliver entertainement and on that regard, space marine worth it, even at current price with no sale discount.The graphics not being nothing awesome, they are still good, voice acting very good and the story is good enough to keep you playing, but the strong point of this game is the gameplay full of action, gore and some funny moments with Orcs, who doesnt like Orcs?Pros:+Pretty up to date textures+Nice amount of weapons that you can choose from+Smooth controls (I would recommend a gamepad if you have one, although M&Key is OK.)+Pretty great soundtrack++Amazing voice work+++One of your Ultramarines looks like Anthony Hopkins+Decently long game+Plenty of multiplayer contentCons:-Due to THQ going bankrupt, there will be no sequel to this *planned* trilogy. (Ends on insanely annoying cliffhanger) -The online playerbase is a bunch of elitist neck-beards that hate new players-Even on the hardest difficulty, the game was still pretty simpleIf you are fan of this universe theme, space marine will let you experience what you already know in a completly diferent perspective, recommend you to try out.

												I really love this game, it really brings the world of Warhammer 40k to life.  It tells a pretty entertaining story (I mean, it's not Bioshock levels of deep but still entertaining).  Gameplay it's not spectacular but still plays as a solid shooter (specifically a third person shooter).  You have a shield but it's relatively frail, you're main source of health is to use a melee combo that knocks other characters unconcious; when you see the cue, you can initiate a pretty gruesome finisher that's brutaly satisfying (possibly Doom 2016 brutal) and restores a bit of health.  I enjoyed the Exterminatus (1 to 4 vs. waves) and the various deathmatch type online gameplay (as expected of games this old, it's just not as populated as it used to be).  Back in the day I enjoyed the Dreadnought Assault DLC, During Multiplayer had all kinds of cool armors you could earn.  Unfortunately you might be hard pressed to get into a game as the online activity seems practically gone.  Perhaps they moved on to Eternal Crusade.Shame about THQ, they started making some really good games before they had to close their doors.  This is one of those games you wish they'd churn out a sequel for to see where the story goes but you know it will never happen.			",58,5,0,9,1,0,16

												This game has been around for a while, and it never really got all the support it deserved. There are a few small bugs and some of the timing is cumbersome, but it's quite polished and fun to play compared to games that are coming out four years later. The netcode leaves something to be desired, but it's sound enough to compete with games like Eternal Crusade, which came out years later.Once you get past the large amounts of DLC skins for Multiplayer only, it's worth the price tag just on the basis of a couple of single-player campaign play-throughs. Getting multiplayer games is tough most days, but when you get into a match is can be quite exciting and entertaining. It's a mixed bag overall, but the pros definitely outweight the cons for a serious Warhammer 40,000 fan even as the game is aging.			",146,22,0,47,27,1,56

												A well-crafted TPS game developed by Relic. Remember the trailer in which Lance Henriksen says he is a space marine? Gameplay-wise it is a very simple game: Titus, our protagonist, uses melee and ranged weapons alike to eliminate hordes of orcs attacking the marines. You also have a fury meter that is gradually filling up as you get rid of enemies. This allows you to unleash even stronger and deadlier attacks.The game has excellent graphics, voice acting and sound effects. While the plot is not something we have not already seen elsewhere, it has its great moments. It is unfortunate that the planned sequels were cancelled as THQ went bankrupt.I do not think multiplayer is played by anyone these days (after all, this is a 3-year old game), but as it is currently on sale (for 10 bucks) you can easily pick it up and spend some quality time with a squad full of ultramarines.

												Dis ain't too naff of a game, yeah.  Good fer gettin' youz stompin' on when waitin' for da WAAAGH to get goin'. I wuz a bit disappointed dat ya can't play as da Orkz, but oi, da game iz called ""Space Mareen"" fer uh reazon, I s'pose.You play az a Space Mahreen Kaptin from da Ultramareens named Titus.  He's a dead 'ard Humie git who don't give a zog abou' nuffing dat would try to duff 'im.  Ya see, he ain't none too 'appy about a Warboss from da Evil Sunz tryin' to loot a Humie planet.  Anywayz, Titus stomps dat naff boy an' saves da planet... 'cept fingz ain't wat dey seem.Da gud fings:""Space Mareen"" iz a fun slog thru da 40k world an' shows lotza diffent fings abou' it dat makes it da best place to WAAGH.Lotza choppas an' shootas to chooze from...    Well, sorta... More on dat below, actually.Fun multaplaya, yeah, but dat don't mean much now 'cuz they ain't many of da boyz playin' it.It duz not get dat boring even afta playin it fer a while.Da Naff Fings:Not enuff choppy.       Dem Space Mehreens iz good at makin' gud choppaz, but dey don't seem to 'ave very many of dem in dis 'un.  No Power Swords, Power Fists or Power Klawz fer Titus.  He getz a Power Axe and a Thunda Hammer at least. He 'az his chainsword o'course.  It iz ratha 'ard to fight with dem, too.  Titus can take sum hits, but he is not dat great at not gettin' hit in da first place. o'course he can roll 'round like a kicked grot but dat just gets borin'. Come on, ya Humie git, dinnit dey teach ya to blokk once an' a while?Meltas don't work like dey should.       'stead of a deff beam dat krumps any git dat ya point it at, da melta jus' spreadz out like a naff shottgunn.  Still hurtz, but zog, get it roight!Da Blasta ('scuze me, Plazma) shootas iz a bit 'ard ta hit fings.     It'll snik whateva it hitz, dough.No Burna weaponz   Nope, none 'round here.  If you wanna light sum gitz on fire youz best look for anotha game.Not a lotta gitz.   You will be stompin and shootin Gretchinz an' Ork Boyz, mostly.  o'course there iz a few nobz or oddboyz thrown in.  After sum time you'll be krumpin' sum Chaos Humies and demon gitz later. Datz pretty much it.  Toss in a few Panzees or even sum of dem blue skinned gitz an bugz and it'll be a real WAAGH.Anywayz, ""Space Mareen"" iz a proppa game, and if you get enuff teef you wuldn't go wrong buyin dis game.

												Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is pretty cool I guess.Set in the distant future where mankind decided that skulls on everything was totally in. The Imperium of Man has spread thoughout the known galaxy with the guidance of a super powered god-like figure known as the Emperor of Mankind. But the Emperor was betrayed by his favored son, Horus, and after a bloody civil war and the defeat of Horus, the Emperor was left as a crippled body upon a golden throne, which is the only thing that's keeping him alive. Now 10,000 years later, humanity is beset on all sides by mutants, aliens, and the forces of Chaos. But it's not all hopeless, for the armies of mankind also have the Space Marines! genetically altered and augmented super soldiers clad in power armor and armed with weapons that would break your arm if you as much as tried to use them. These Space Marines are split into chapters, and no chapter is greater than the Ultramarines, warriors who lead and try to set an example for all Space Marines to follow. So basically they're the brown-nosing nerds of the 40k Universe.You play as Titus, a Space Marine captain of the Ultramarines. Which is to say he's the star quarterback on a team made entirely out of quarterbacks. You and your team of similarly jacked super soldiers are deployed on the planet Graia, a Forgeworld that focuses on military development as well as the development of super cool giant robots! Graia is under attack by Orks, a war-like race of fungus based aliens that consist entirely of soccer hooligans that come in sizes ranging from big to Big to BIG. Also little Goblins called Gretchins, but they don't matter. Titus must secure the giant robot making factory so that the orks don't strip down the giant robot sitting inside for parts. Which would be...Heresy? I think? Yeah, heresy! Space Marine is a third person shooter with an emphasis on getting down and dirty with your enemy. Which is sexy, but also not. You are given a plethora of weapons to carry, as well as a choice of melee weapon for when you have to put your arms up at 10 and 2 against the alien scumbags. While your weapons fill most of the essential shooter roles, one stands out the most, which is your standard issue Bolter, which is an assault  weapon that fires .75 calibre rounds which are explosive tipped and rocket propelled. I don't think understand what I just said. You are essentially firing the fist of an angry at anything dumb enough to not be born human, and sometimes humans as well because screw em. But sometimes the orks get close and you have to have a strong word with them, and what better way to do that then with a chainsword. A chainsaw sword.A sword that doubles as a chainsaw.It's a chainsaw on a stick.Am I even getting through to you right now? Not only do you have a Chainsword, but you also have a power axe, a weapon covered in a blue-hazy force field THAT IS CAPABLE OF DISRUPTING THE MOLECULAR BONDS OF MATTER WHEN IT STRIKESAnd a thunder hammer, a giant hammer... Also it explodes. How the game works is that you mix your two styles of combat together, engaging your enemies from a distance with your ranged weapons and then closing in with your melee weapon to give them a stern talking to.And by that I mean murder. Your enemies will always outnumber you, so 9 times out of 10 you're going to be in melee combat anyway. The melee itself isn't all that impressive, you have an attack button and you have a stun button, but you can also grab stunned enemies and turn them into a fine red paste for health. That's the only way you can get your health back, you execute the stunned enemies in a gory fashion which refills your health like you're some sort of buff vampire.Or you can get really mad  for a few seconds and let your health refill that way. Luckily, the weapons in this game are crunchy enough to feel rewarding for every playstyle so don't be afraid to mix it up. You're going to get into melee combat, either way. So at least the weapons feel nice to use. Titus himself, as a Space Marine, is a pretty heavy fellow, but don't say that to his face because you might hurt his feelings, and Titus is a nice guy. You monster.Oh yeah, also he can kill you. The Space Marines move with weighted thuds to every one of their steps, making them seem like lumbering oafs at first, until you get Titus to go into a charge. Now he's like a rip roaring retard rhino that can smash down everything in his way. Space Marines are surprisingly agile for their size, but I guess that comes with the whole Super Soldier thing. You'd think that at least their pauldrons get in the way, but they don't seem to have a problem with them. But should you play Battlemallet 40,000: Star Guys? It's pretty good, especially if it's on sale. I haven't played the multiplayer since it came out, but I remember having a little fun with that as well, so you at least have some staying power with the game, if people even still play. The 40k universe itself is fairly unique and the dialogue and characteristics of the characters might actually catch you off guard if you aren't familiar with the source material. I would say check it out, it's nothing amazing but it's still fun to play. The game can drag on near the end, which is a complaint I've been having a lot recently. Where a new enemy type basically forces you through a gauntlet of rooms filled with them before you can reach the end. It kind of feels like they almost ran over their dead line making this game since the last part of the game has encounters the game itself isn't really built for. Space marines in this game don't take cover, and there's a lot of shooting going on near the end.Also the last boss is bogus, but the boss before him is pretty good. Combatcroquet 40x1000 gets 7 giant pauldrons out of 10. It's pronounced Ro-boot-ay Gill-ee-Man, by the way.

												This is the third person shooter + melee game. I am huge Warhammer 40k fan and if you are you should buy it and if you are not, it is passable. Buy on sale, and don‘t buy Collection ever because DLCs are for MP which is almost dead. I will talk about lore because gameplay is your typical TPS/M with 40k addition.It‘s obvious that devs were huge 40k fans. Game is set in parallel timeline where Titus (you play with him) is the commander of 2nd Ultramarine Company and in ""reality"" is famous Cato Sicarius. I can‘t complain about graphical details, they are fantastic lore wise. My main problem is very bad story. SPOILERSGame is set on planet Graia. That is Forge World in Segmentum Temperus, it‘s homeworld of Legio Astramana (Morning Star) and production grade is I-Secundi. So it‘s Adeptus Mechanicus domain. Whole game there is no AdMech except one Titan. Even when you force your way to Warlord-class Titan, nothing. Where are Skitarii, Relic? There is no way Orks can overrun one of the most protected AdMech Forge World. No way all Skitarii died. It‘s total BS that some IG regiments (even they are Cadian) can survive Orks and vastly superior Skitarii can‘t. It seems that only one Titan survived from the whole AdMech in planet.And then you found out video message from Inquisitor who has secret laboratory! Ha ha ha. Come on, this is even worse. Yes, in theory Inqusition is Emperor‘s right hand and they are above everybody else (in theory, again) but here we talk about AdMech which is allied Empire with Imperium of Man. It‘s impossible for Inquisitor to set up secret laboratory in Forge World. 1) It would be outright heresy for Cult Mechanicus and 2) AdMech doesn‘t share anything with Imperium because they have monopoly on technology by Treaty of Mars. Even if Inquisitor found out fully funcional STC, it would be still impossible. I get it‘s parallel timeline, but I don‘t like too much imagination or it‘s just lack of appropriate knowledge lore wise. P. S.Your Ultramarine captain Titus is *BLAM* Heresy!""Travellin' through space is boring. Well, boring unless da hulk yer on is full of dem gene-sneakers, or a base fer da chaos lads wiv da spikes, or already has Boyz on it. Or if humie lootas come callin', that's always good fer a bit a sport. Or unless yer have a mutiny or two to pass da time, or unless strange fings start happenin', which dey usually do when yer out in da warp. One time we had some bloody great ugly fing come straight out of Weird Lugwort's 'ed! It butchered half da lads, that was pretty entertainin'. Come ter fink of it, space is a pretty good larf. And that's before yer find yerself a nice world ta crush!"" ",299,63,23,45,36,5,95

												Literally the single best shooter I have ever played. The netcode is horrendous, and the game is Peer2Peer, resulting in a frankly hilarious amount of lag, but the lag compensation usually makes up for the massive lapses in connection that occur. There are also a few unbalanced weapons, which have a tendency to break the game if people use them en masse. The campaign doesn't tell much of a story, which is disappointing, but to be expected from a game where the focus is chainsword enemas. The leveling system is reminiscent (as in, a carbon copy of) the old Call of Duty games, which is aggravating because if you want to use a specific weapon you have to play for a significant period of time before you get it.But aside from that the game is beautiful. The game plays like one would expect a Space Marine game to play; EVERYONE is overpowered! Assault/Raptor marines can traverse the entire map in a few short bursts from their jump packs, Tactical marines can level an entire room with some careful thinking and the right weapons, and Devestators can murderize anything that they can see in a matter of seconds. To this end, Space Marine is one of the few ""Super Soldier"" games that makes you feel like you are an actual Super Soldier. The combat is stellar, tactics and careful thinking pay greater dividends than being able to shoot well; this might be because everyone has a gigantic hitbox and the aim assist is practically palpable, but for me that's a good thing. Sneaking around your enemy and doing hit-and-run attacks are far more effective then just waltzing into a room and using your 10-years honed aiming skills to get 1337 360 headshots on everybody. Overall, this is a thinking man's shooter. I played it for about a week before I was able to pick that up, and realized that even with the most basic gear and perks (I still use the starting weapons), I could steamroll the entirety of the opposition with a few deft maneuvers. The campaign is more of an after-work/after-school thing, same goes for the Exterminatus gamemode; for those days when you just want to exert your views on religiously justified genocide. The multiplayer is the real gem with this game; a shooter where thinking is more important than skills.			",99,9,0,5,6,0,25

												Brick Shithouse Simulator.Up until this point, all the 40k games i've played have been RTS games, where I had to move dudes around a battle map and make them shoot at things I don't like. Being able to actually control one of those dudes for once is kinda neat, even if I'm not particularly interested in this franchise: it just has some good games made from it.It's pretty much your typical 40k Space Marine plot in that you are sent to punch some Orcs, but a much greater threat looms that is unknown to you until you unwittingly assist them. Then it's a more serious fight as you are forced to confront this larger danger and ultimately beat it. Perhaps the most notable art of the plot are the questions asked about your main character, and whether or not they themselves are loyal and not falling into villainy. Sadly the game leaves this question ultimately unanswered. Guess they had to do something to leave the possibility of a sequel open. >_>Gameplay-wise it is fairly mixed. The combat and all the nice weapons to use are fun, but the entire game pretty much consists of going through linear areas and killing hordes of enemies. Also it's not particuarly long, and it has a multiplayer thing that means i'll never 100% this game. Raeg.If you are a fan of 40k and you always wanted to run around being a Space Marine instead of just commanding them in a smelly RTS, then I guess this is a game you can play to satisfy that itch. But for people who are not fans of this series, I wouldn't bother. In the end i'll say ""yes"" because it is, ultimately, a fan game, and those fans probably will enjoy this game to some degree.Bwee.			",241,93,0,62,44,2,65

Who comes up with this idea??? Graphics are pretty damn good.Sound is amazing.You get to level up, unlock skill sets, all in the NAME OF THE EMPEROR.Cons:You will forget your family after a while the longer you play this.If this is on sale, get it.

There is only the Emperor, and he is our shield and protector. Man i had this on my wishlist a good while (THX You Humble Bundle :P ) .This game is pretty darn good!  I always like the Warhammer 40k story but could never get into the Strat games myself (Not a big strategy game player).This is 100% not a Strat game its a kick @ss and take names action game!!! The game plays a bit like Gears of War-ish (Third Person Perspective) .As you play you get new weapons and unlocks as you progress threw the campaign to aid you.The games gfx are nice enuf and runs real good for a action game.The story is pretty ok also!!The game has multiplayer also!! ( ""For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my battle-brother eternal."" ) =D So if you like a good action game give W40K:SM a shot and a stab :) Im sure you will like it !!!

												WARHAMMER 40.000: SPACE MARINE™ is a Third Person Shooter from Relic Entertainment (the game-development studio responsible for the classic Space-RTS HOMEWORLD, as well as renowned RTS-series' COMPANY OF HEROES and WH40K: DAWN OF WAR) and was published in 2011 by the now-defunct THQ Inc. The game is based on the Table-Top tactical wargame WARHAMMER 40.000 (WH40K) by Games Workshop and features:A full-fledged SINGLE PLAYER STORY-MODE that will take between 6 - 10 hours to finish (depending on difficulty)A tacked-on but insanely addictive COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER MODE (with way too few maps or game-modes; also the worst internet-connection system for mp-games ever conceived by humans: Peer-to-Peer connection. Like, seriously, Relic, FFS!!!)And an even more tacked-on but also insanely fun 4 PLAYER CO-OP MODE (which suffers from the fact that it uses options and systems from the competitive mp-mode)STORY & GAMEPLAY:It is the grimdark future of space and there is only war, and as you may or may not know, war never changes. What this means is that everything absolutely sucks for everyone, especially if you are a human worker or a human soldier amongst the billions upon billions of other, unimportant human beings on one of the many planets belonging to the Imperium of Man. One such place is the forge-world Graia and it's being attacked by an overwhelming planetary invasion force of the ORKS, one of the many weird, disgusting and/or brutal Xenos-races threatening the Imperium, who like nothing more than to crush your skull and paint their cars red with your blood to make them go faster (obviously).There are, however, some people in the future of space who don't think that everything sucks! These people are, of course, the Space Marines™, who are the very best of the best in the galaxy and have been genetically modified and outfitted to deal with the absolute worst that the future, space and beyond have to offer. Space Marines™ enjoy nothing more than fighting (and eventually dying) for the God-Emperor of Mankind. And when they are not fighting or dying they are usually found praying to the Emperor for more fighting and the honour of dying a glorious death during fighting.So now imagine an 8-foot tall, towering half-god encased in mighty, shiny power-armor, equiped with an assault rifle that shoots grenades in one hand, a chainsaw in the shape of a sword in the other, wearing a helmet that looks more badass than that of Darth Vader™ and implanted with, among other things, a second heart to withstand the most brutal of heartbreaks (and I don't mean the kind that you and I go through when Megan Fox or Ryan Gosling never answer our phone calls) and you get an idea of what it is to be one of the Emperor's finest.Actually, stop imagining things and start playing this game because, quite frankly, there is nothing quite like it. This isn't Gears of War™, where you cower behind chest-high walls, sucking your thumb until your health regenerates and then sometimes take pot-shots against ugly-looking freaks. No, here you charge into a horde of said freaks and smash their heads in to regenerate your health back (your shield will refill on its own, though, no smashing and bashing required). Use a variety of ranged weaponry, such as your trusty Bolter, plasma weapons, grenades or sniper rifles and shotguns that shoot flames instead of bullets, as well as various melee weapons, such as the iconic Chainsword, the Power Axe and the epic Thunder-Hammer (long, strong and throbbing with energy) to vanquish countless waves of cartoonishly villanous beasts and demons. Please the God-Emperor by bringing death to his enemies and he will refill your FURY, granting you a temporary boost to your awesomeness with more head-smashing power for melee attacks and bullet-time™ for shooty attacks.Enjoy fluid and seamless combat that allows you to run into a group of enemies, shoulder-barge the lot of them, slap one, stomp another, then grab another one, cut him into pieces and then spray the rest of them with bolter-rounds until they explode into chunky bits, all in the matter of seconds and through the press of a few buttons/keys.The gameplay is solid, though repetitive; you'll spend hours upon hours fighting against the hordes of the Ork race, which, even though you continuously acquire new gear throughout the course of the campaign, can get tiring after an hour or two of playtime. This is especially true if brown, grey and more brown corridors and levels bore you quickly. On the other hand, to mix things up you get to use a jetpack (or jump-pack) from time to time, allowing you to take to the skies and crush your enemies from above. And we all know that jetpacks make everything better in video-games, don't we?Anyway, eventually you will get to fight some other enemies later on, but for most of the game it's Orks, Orks, Orks, big Orks, small Orks, bigger Orks, even BIGGER Orks and then more Orks.The story is serviceable and nothing ground-breaking (well, this isn't exactly Shakespeare: The Video-Game here), just your typical WH40K-fare. However, the voice-acting is solid enough, with a strong central performance by british actor Mark Strong (which you may or may not remember from films such as ""Zero Dark Thirty"" or the first ""K i c k - A s s"").OVERALL:Even though it is repetitive & brown I still I love this game more than any of the other repetitive & brown games that I have played within the last 4 - 5 years, simply for the fact that this game is unique in the way combat works; you feel like a walking tank and unstoppable when you cut through tons of enemies like a hot knife through kittens....er...I mean butter, yes....butter. Though, the threat of death is always present and you can easily lose yourself in the adreanline rush of power-tripping, only to let your guard down and allow enemies to surround you, swarm you and then kill you in the matter of seconds. You have to be mindful of your attackers, of your surroundings and you have to use everything to your advantage. Use your entire arsenal against your foes, think tactically, be mobile and never forget   to user cover - but without having to sit behind it like a little girl crying for her dead kittens.....errr...This is a flawed little gem of a game, but one that is definitely worth the price of admission.Seriously, if this game happens to be on sale, like, right now then just buy the bloody thing! Why are you even wasting time reading reviews when you could be single-handedly performing awesome bloody grimdark-genocide already? I would whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys action-games, especially players of classic shooters such as DooM, Quake, Blood, etc. or any other game that focuses more on mobility and diverse weaponry rather than staying stationary behind walls with marginaly different assault rifles.And while some hardcore WH40K-fans may cringe at some of the design choices in the game (because some things in this game do not conform to the established lore of the franchise) everyone should just take this game for what it is: A carnage-filled and action-packed power-fantasy (from an admittedly brown, bitter and boring-looking future).---A NOTICE ON THE DLC-PACKS:All of the DLC-packs are for the MULTIPLAYER only! Thus it is not worth having the various (cosmetic!) DLC- armors and weapons if you're not absolutely into the online-portion of the game. The gamebreaking bugs on the CHAOS DLC multiplayer-maps prevent them from being enjoyed by what's left of the community. You can still find people playing the Chaos Invasion map for the EXTERMINATUS CO-OP mode but you have to decide if that alone is worth paying full price.The DREADNOUGHT DLC, on the other hand, is an additional VERSUS game-mode that, while awesome, generally just isn't being played.

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Space marine is a game where to take a role as a super soldier, appealing can get a little repetitive after while (doing the same finishing moves which are Great).theres nothing better than playing a ranged smurf marine who has the power to crush a car with his bare hands. the game is very appealing to 40k hobbyists and appealing to those who are interested in a new kind of game.Remember being a 8feet tall mountain of power armor u dont need Cover..... Cover needs you.Overall: Enjoy this game, whether you're a smurf marine or (what ever legion you are)and if you have a shack full of regular action games and want to try something a bit different.... Space marine is the game for you.			",1949,754,75,171,243,17,313

												Pros:+It's a 40k game and you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ space smurf, highly enjoyable for the content-starved fan+There is nothing more satisfying than executing Nobs and tearing everything apart with the Storm Bolter+Graphics were fine+No obvious bugs+MP LascannonCons:-Difficulty scaled arbitrarily: Normal was far too easy and hard made you feel like an IG grunt. The Warboss' charge on hard was a 1-hit kill-Plasma gun filled no role that was not already better filled by another gun-Highly linear, basically on-rails-Lack of any depth in the plot-Predictable story and plot-twists-Very, very short campaign-Combat remains unchanged throughout the campaign and becomes stale--Endless running through empty hallways to elevators which take you up (or down!) to doors which take you to more empty hallways, elevators and doorsIn general, at $33 it's poor value for what you get. If you're a 40k fan then wait until a sale, do not pay full price for this. I found it very enjoyable but the campaign has no replay value and the price tag is far too high.			",46,15,0,1,6,0,3

												This is a game you play for when you want to turn your brain off and bulldoze your way through hordes of enemies. The game stays true to the source material and really makes you feel the part of an Adeptus Astartes. The sounds are great, the visuals are acceptable (though given the games location, I was pleasantly surprised with how they created variety), the story is pretty standard for a Warhammer 40K title with a twist that I admittedly didn't see coming, but where this game truly shines is in the combat.The guns are all fun, mostly portable with a couple turret sections scattered here and there, though eventually you find the ones that you stick with for the remainder of the game, *cough* Lazcannon *cough*. The melee weapons and the jump pack though are the ones that make you feel like an angel of death with the Chainsword, Power Axe, and Thunder Hammer all available for use. Executions are both the most satisfying and bloody kills you can get, but also the way you get health back something especially important on the higher difficulties.Ultimately, this is a fantastic title which offers a surprisingly challenging campaign on Hard and all the blood and gore you could ever want.

												Do you enjoy a nice neon-paletted future where corporations rule and humanity is kept down by an oppressive government? Well then you'll like this, provided you don't want the neon palette. This is the vision of a future where humanity is past its' prime and is trying to fend off the slow decay of time; all while fending off hordes of aliens and daemons. The grimness of this universe is a refreshing twist, even after several decades as a series.Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine puts you in the boots and bulky armour of one of the Imperiums' chapters of Space Marines. If you like sitting behind a wall and occasionally firing over the wall, then just stop there. In this game, there ARE no walls (metaphorically speaking of course)! YOU are the wall. You are a shield for the weak and a sword to be swung by the powers that be. As much as the game preaches that life is the Emperors' currency; you are a sturdy block of gold, in a world populated by pennies and pound coins. So what makes you so valuable, apart from the shiny aspect of your nature?You are a block of Gold. Let's do a comparison. I want you to drop a penny onto your fingers while they are on a desk. Didn't hurt, did it? Now; drop a big block of Gold. If you actually did, I applaud your delusion of invulnerability, but I'm not going to kiss your boo-boo better. If you didn't; you're smarter than the person asking me to kiss the boo-boo. You see, logical thought dictates that there is a big difference in the damage a penny and a Gold Brick can do. You play the heavier of the two objects; that most delightful bringer of death. You are a big stompy thundering cannon comprised of flesh and muscle, located securely behind an energy shield and a hell of alot of metal. You don't fire a little 9mm pistol as you do in so many other titles. With your bulkier stature, you should be able to wield more mighty weapons and this game will allow you. Ever wondered what happens when a rocket propelled explosive shell (with a diameter of nearly an inch) comes into contact with the face of a 6 foot Ork, armed with naught but a club and a suicidal disregard for the laws of physics and mortality? If you answered ""red?"" then the klaxons in your room, set to ring with the sounds of victory when you are correct (at least if you're as egocentric as I) should be deafening you in reward for your foresight.In a world full of games with lots of brown or orange; this game decides that red is still a viable colour. VERY viable. In fact, so viable that often times you will encounter pools of red where once a green enemy stood. If you are discouraged by blood, this game isn't for you. If you like blood, this game delivers it in such vast amounts that even the least sadomasochistic of us would still require the unbuttoning of the jeans to alleviate the tightness the combat produces. While I recommend this game to women as well, this game has an undeniable reek of man about it. I would be surprised if the word ""testosterone"" was not included once in every five lines of code written for the engine. While there is a brilliant plot behind the title, it isn't one that I'd recommend you buy the game for. The plot isn't what you want in a game, is it? Plot is a nice addition but gameplay is what differentiates a game from a movie or book and this is a shining example of that ideology. You fire rocket propelled shells from a fully automatic death-cannon; when you aren't lobbing balls of corrosive plasma into the faces of a tiny little green fellow. But range is only a part of the game. To regenerate health, you are not allowed to cower. Your health is tied to your efficiency in combat, as it drops when your shield is depleted and raises when you execute an enemy in close combat. To replenish your red goo, you need to turn your foes into red goo, and presumably the splat perks your character up enough to make him healthy again. Still makes more sense than being eaten by a dog in an open world game and healing up by pulling a bullet out of your left arm. It sounds better too. There is a definite booming sound behind your guns and your mighty melee weapons sound vastly different when they smash into metal in comparison to tearing through flesh. Your chainsword revs pleasurably as you swing it and your heavy bolters sound exactly as the name makes you believe. They sound heavy, as if they were firing bolts. Now let us discuss multiplayer. Six big stompy fellows clash against six big stompy fellows and there are three types of big stompy fellow you can be. You can be a tactical marine, who lumbers across the battlefield with some medium power ranged weapons. The assault marines jet around the battlefield with jump packs, slamming with a mighty force into the ground before spinning their melee weapons viciously to rend the flesh of all who oppose them. If you are more of a heavy fellow, the Devastators will fit you perfectly. Armed with the biggest weapons of all three, they stomp and wield death at range. They are so heavily equipped that instead of shoulder charging an enemy to interrupt the swing of their sword; they kick them. Even as you walk, the camera shakes to give you the true sense that you are heavy, gifted the power of a ton of metal and muscle. The ground never seems to sit still when you introduce twelve armoured Goliaths upon a map.This is a game of David versus Goliath; except this time, you play Goliath and logic wins over storybook morality. Big stompy fellows don't get stopped by a stone, they club the sling wielder into the ground with fist and foot.			",166,8,12,16,11,3,15

												Surely a masterpiece that the Emperor can look upon with pride.Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a fun, action packed, third-person shooter that takes you into the grim future filled with war.It is one of the best Warhammer games to date. Infact I'm surprised Games Workshop haven't released a sequel to this GLORIOUS PIECE OF WORK! This is the kind of game we want from you GW not f***ing chess games.As story goes, you play as Captain Titus of the Ultra s̶m̶u̶r̶f̶s̶ marines tasked with leading his squad as a supportive vanguard for Imperial Guardsman who are having trouble dealing with an Ork invasion, as the story progresses you will eventually encounter a threat that is greater than a mere Ork invasion.It really is an immersive experience, the multiplayer is fantastic even though the community has died out a little it isn't uncommon to find a full lobby. The coolest thing is that you can customize your character, matching your Space Marine to your tastes.The Adeptus Ministorum, the Adepta Sororitas and the Inquisition approve of this marvellous game.

												The Imperial Forge World Graia is under heavy attack by Orks. Since Graia is a place where War Titans are constructed it has to be defended at any cost. Unfortunately there is no army close enough to react in time, so a part of the Ultramarine's 2nd company which happens to be closer to Graia is sent there. The Ultramarine's Captain Titus is the protagonist of the game. He and two other Marines - Leandros and Veteran Sergeant Sidonus - barely make it to the surface of Graia since the Orks are already controlling the planet's airspace. Soon Titus finds out that Graia holds something even more valuable than War Titans and that something even more dangerous than Orks is at work here.Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a third person action game. It cannot really be called a third person shooter because melee combat is an integral part of the game. Titus has access to various melee and ranged weapons. He starts out with a knife, a bolt pistol and a bolter. Later, more weapons can be found. The pistol and the bolter are not swap-able, they are however later changed into a plasma pistol and a kraken bolter. Titus can equip two more ranged weapons and one melee weapon at a time. Those can be swapped out for other weapons freely. Additionally Titus can have up to five grenades with him. Space Marine flips turret sections the bird. Yes, there are mounted guns that you can use from time to time. But you can just rip those out and walk around with them. There are also some sections in which Titus uses a jump pack. While using one of those he is restricted to melee weapons, pistol and bolter.Combat in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is extremely visceral and satisfying. All of the weapons feel powerful. One thing the game gets extremely right is conveying what a Space Marine actually is. He is not just a heavily armored soldier. He is a genetically enhanced super soldier carrying weapons that normal people would not even be able to use effectively. A Space Marine's armor is pretty much the finest one humanity is able to craft and only works because of the servos inside of it. The size difference between the Space Marines and the soldiers of the Imperial Guard is highly noticeable. Also you can kill weaker enemies by simply dashing into them. Titus' armor regenerates after not being hit for a few moments. Health however is replenished by executing stunned enemies. Some weaker enemies can be executed right away without even hitting them first, further conveying the actual power of a Space Marine. This is the single thing the game does best in my opinion: making you actually feel like a Space Marine.The single player campaign is fairly enjoyable. It can drag a little in the middle part but it's not that bad. The only real gripe I have with the game is the final boss battle. In my opinion it is quite lazy and uninspired. It is also an unnecessary late difficulty spike since there is only one autosave during the whole fight as opposed to the other boss battle where there were regular autosaves between phases. Other than that the campaign is really fun.The multiplayer is surprisingly well done. It features classic modes such as team deathmatch and capture the flag as well as exterminatus that is basically a horde mode. Players play either as Space Marines or Chaos Space Marines and can choose from three classes: Tactical, Devastator (Havoc) and Assault (Raptor). Tactical Marines are the most versatile character and can equip a variety of different weapons. Devastator Marines carry the heaviest ranged weapons but are the least mobile class. Assault Marines are equipped with jump packs and focus heavily on melee weapons. Players unlock more weapons and equipment to choose from as they gain levels. Multiple loadouts can be saved for quick access. Also, every character can have two different perks in his loadout. Actually you unlock the second perk slot at level 15 but it does not take long to get there. Different perks and armor parts are unlocked via challenges that work pretty much like achievements. Armor is just for the looks, so players can pick whatever they like best. There are several armor sets but you can also choose to mix and match parts of them together to your liking. It can take a while to unlock the perks you want but that is partially negated by the ability to copy the loadout of the person who killed you instead of taking your normal loadout on respawn. The only shortcoming of the multiplayer is that it is peer2peer based and therefore can be laggy depending on who is the host.Long story short, Warhammer 40,000 is a really enjoyable game that is pretty much a must-have for warhammer fans but also worth a look for everybody who likes action games.More reviews here ",268,35,3,26,16,4,28

												It's not a bad game, but it has its issues. The game is generally fun but combat can become stale. Here's a breakdown:Pros:- Certain gameplay elements are quite fun, such as the jump pack (death from above!)- Follows 40K lore so the fans should be pleased.- Various weapons to use and you can choose which combination to go with- Be a space marine badass! Nothing like a furious charge into foes and giving them a taste of the emperor's fury delivered by your blade or thunder maul.Cons:- Gameplay is repetitive, movement is clunky. You're essentially moving from one area to the next to shoot then melee enemies. There are some dodge rolls but your character is about as agile as a rhino wearing metal boots trying to navigate a messy construction site. I get it, space marines are in power armour, but they're also supposed to be fast and agile (apparently).- From my understanding, space marines can heal faster than regular humans, yet at best he has some invisible shield that soaks some damage before breaking and your hitpoints go. Your health does not recover unless you stun and execute enemies, or you use your special ability to recover health. Perhaps some health vials or medipacks would have helped.- There is no upgrade system. Your marine is as weak or strong at the start as he is at the end. It's a little disappointing not being able to tweak things like in DoW 2.- There are a lot of orcs, but it feels like mowing them down is short-lived when the choas dudes appear. This is partially because of the linear nature of the game and when you're defending a point or person, they tend to resolve their issues quickly before the horde gets too overwhelming.- Be prepared to suffer the consequences of your poor weapon loadout choices. Oh, so you think that badass thundermaul is going to bail you out of trouble when you run out of bullets? Tell me again how space marines are supposed to be able to heal when you're eating bullets, lazer fire and grenades before you even get to the enemy.- The mechanics of the game leave a lot to be desired. It's not quite a cover-based shooter, but you can't melee your way through everything. There will be areas where you're pinned down, relying on a plasma pistol and unable to get to the enemy because they're on an unreachable platform. So you use up your bullets trying to take down the sponges while Renegade guardsmen chew through your armour...then come some grenades to flush you out, forcing you out in the open where heavily armoured chaos marines wait with bolter fire.- The AI is infuriating. Your AI team mates are stupid and sometimes don't shoot, they sometimes draw enemy fire but generally speaking you're the primary target. That is, the enemy will ignore your squad mates and charge straight for you. There is also a special place in the Warp for the chaos marines and orcs whose artillery fire is so accurate, they can fire while moving and still hit you.- Be prepared to get pinned down, a lot. If you were expecting a non stop action, orc slaying fest with your chainsword, think again. This game doesn't know what it wants to be at times. If you charge in to melee them, you can get overwhelmed easily, so you end up shooting first to thin their numbers before meleeing a few for extra health. The game is not quite a tactical shooter and not quite a melee/action hack and slash. Because you're so weak, going full on melee is not feasible, but the enemies can be bullet sponges so you may run out of ammo, forcing you to run in and most likely die. There is also a tendency for them to leave you with little room to move when the hordes + long range fire come in. So get used to pointing your pistol around the corner to get a few shots in before the enemy gets close enough to melee.It's not a bad game if you overlook those flaws. It's interesting and fun at times. But there are too many instances where you're walking from one room to access another, or from one elevator to access another. It would have been better if the game gave you more freedom to choose, such as a class or through upgrades. Would not have minded some terminator armour, either.I'd give it 6/10. Get it on sale.

												For me, THQ nailed the visuals and the sound for the Space Marines, Orks included! I can't stop slow-walking, just to listen to that steady clump-clump of my Marines' boots as he walks LOL! The power of the holy Bolter resonates beautifully, with amazing smoke trails off the shell. I do feel like I am firing a Godwin pattern Bolter. As with the proportions; I'd have liked the scale of MArine - Human a little bigger, but I am not disapointed :) The background scenery is some of the most beautiful I have seen in a shooter. Grand towers and ornamented architecture that soar high into the Industrial World's air, the sunset and fluffy clouds are very screenshot-worthy. The navigable scenery is very clumpy and I can tell I am playing a console game. No havoc engine destruction, no craters that remain...a PC could handle that, but a console cannot, so I do not like the reminders that I am having to compromise on gameplay yet still pay full price. It does get repetetive. I find myself having to constantly re-try checkpoints for some silly bit that I just can't get past - HOWEVER, after practice, you will find yourself succeeding.The main problem I find is the complicated controls. For a start, I cannot re-bind them. Secondly, to perform certain manouvers like simply throwing a grenade, you HAVE to read the rapidly appearing and disapearing prompt FIRST TIME, or else you have to play 'let's hit every key till we get it' game as there is NO controls menu (can you believe that???) for anything other than firing the gun and swinging the smashy smashy.Furthermore issues I have with the controls is that to perform tekken-style moves in order to regain your health is probably THE most annoying feature of this game. I want to conduct myself as a soldier, on a PC, not a tekken or streetfighter gamer on a console. This does smack of streets of rage in places I'll warn you now. But there is something slightly satisfying about taking down 6 orcs in one slash of my Chain Sword. Mounted weapons do not respond to the 'E' interaction move which I actually class as an in-game bug, (you'll see what I mean). However there is the option to tear the mounted heavy Bolter OFF it's mount! >:D This does not mean that you have acquired a new heavy weapon however, as he drops it after about 60 seconds or so. So make the most of them :) The inventory menu is based on 4 slots ONLY, whereby a more powerful weapon type REPLACES YOUR OLD ONE - which I found very upsetting, I cried.Again, with all linear shooters, this game can be completed in an afternoon <sigh> but I think you all have become accustomed to that eh? My advice, buy this in a sale. It is good fun, and if you want your Ultramarines brought to life somewhat beautifully, it's worth it for that alone :)If it wasn't for the horrible consolitis that this game suffers from, I'd give it 7/10 but it's gonna have to be a stingy 6/10.

												I really enjoyed my playthrough of this game, it is a fantastic Hack and Slash/Third Person Shooter that starts at 100mph and doesn't really slow down. I don't really know much about Warhammer 40k, but this game introduced me to the different factions, what they stand for, and why they fight each other. This game is quite short, but if you want an adrenaline filled few hours of constant shooting and slaughtering, you need to buy this game.			",81,16,1,9,4,0,3

												Not a complex game, but fun and stylish. The level design and story progression are completely linear, and all visuals and dialogues are set in the cliché universe of Warhammer 40k - however, I like that dystopic sci-fi world. The game is not very hard either, as soon as you understood which weapon to use in certain tactical situations and when to pop your fury buff. A special mechanic is how to regenerate health: Not some food or med kits lying around guarantee your survival, but executing stunned monsters in close combat, which means that your regeneration is not handed out to you, you have to work for it, and I like that, too. The most remarkable thing about this particular W40k game, apart from the excellent sound effects and voice acting, is your character. It is not a story of ""rising from nothing"" and becoming a great hero - you already start as one. You are a captain of the Ultramarines, the genetically enhanced elite force of the Emperor in his war against the enemies of mankind, aliens and demons. You are a respected leader amongst your battle brothers, and as every Space Marine has a part of the Emperor himself in his genes, common humans in the Imperial army refer to you as ""My Lord"" and bend their knees to you. This setting makes it plausible that you are an invincible power armored fighting machine who can single-handedly defeat hordes of opponents with your arsenal of ranged and melee weapons. Plausability is good for immersion, and besides, it feels good to be revered a little!I was a bit underwhelmed by the final boss fight. After several waves of mobs you already encountered before, you switch to a falling scenario and press buttons prompted to you on the screen. You win by - clicking your mouse as fast as you can. That feels cheap and breaks the immersion almost completely. With a little more variety in regard to the mobs and a more creative ending, this game could have been very good - like this, it is just ""good enough"": 6.5/10 from me, for the solo campaign. I have not tried multiplayer yet and cannot comment on that part of the game.			",114,28,1,38,22,0,33

												Skip to ""Will I like this game?"" at the bottom if you want the summary!Pro's:Campaign - Fun smashing orks with brutal and varied finishing moves. Combat employs  both melee and ranged attacks seamlessly. Ripping off a mounted heavy bolter and mowing down Ork grass is always 400 bullets of pure joy. The voice acting is good and a decent story line. The audio books you find along the way add a nice touch.Exterminatus - Co Op survival vs hordes is also fun with a group of guys, gets very challenging at the end!Con's:Campaign - This is really the best part of the game. The only con is the levels seem pretty plain as far as design, variety, and fine details. Much of a halo 1 type feel.Exterminatus - The 2nd best part of the game. Pretty good, but really disappointing you don't get the very useful finishing moves and some of the melee combos you get in the campaign. There are also only a couple of maps so variety isn't there.PvP - This is where the review starts to take a big negative. I'm not sure if the game originally had dedicated servers, but it sure doesn't now. It uses peer to peer connections. Since the game is a little old, the player base is pretty small and scattered worldwide. Playing peer to peer across continents in an FPS game is a nightmare. The worst offender to game experience is assault marines warping all over the place. It looks like you've dodge rolled out of the way and they aren't swinging even close to you but your guy just falls over dead. The fall speed from jump packs is way to slow. Once an assault marine jumps they can just float in the clouds for 2 min until you show up and slam down with their laggy swings to lock you in. While the jump pack is on its few second cool down they get very boosted ""mini"" jumps. If the game didn't suffer from horrible lag every single match I could work with it.Plasma Cannons are annoying with grenade launcher like shots all over the map. But I guess I can't blame people for using them. You need to cover a lot of ground to hit a warping assault marine.Another problem is every time someone joins a match the games slows to a crawl while they connect to all other players(another benefit of P2P). It's incredibly disrupting to game play.Yet another constant disruption during matches is ""host migration"". I'm not sure if it only changes when the host leaves or starts to have poor performance, but it happens many times during matches and you guessed it, the match comes to a complete stop until the new host is in place then resumes. The game usually waits until you are in an important fight to screw you.Achievement Hunters - Stay away!!! The campaign achievements are fun. It's when you get to multiplayer where you will get killed. There are 3 really bad achievements here.       1. Completing all 90+ weapon challenges . It takes a very, very long time to get and will make you depressed if you want 100%. They aren't all just based on getting x amount of kills with x weapon. They include things like kill streaks, multi-kills, and head shot only kills(not terrible but keep in mind the lag).       2. Getting 40k kills(combined all game types). The best way is playing exterminatus where you fight waves, but the game will get boring way before that.       3. The 3rd is having a 10 KD on annihilation. That's a problem because either no one plays it or the match is too short to get in the 10 kills in time. You could boost in a private match to get, up to your standards.Will I like this game?Achievement Hunters: No!! Do not buy. You will suffer greatly.Single Player: You will love it! Wait for a sale though.DLC: Do not buy, no one plays it.Co Op: Limited amounts of replay ability since only one mode and a couple of maps, worth it on sale only.PvP: Although has potential to be fast paced, brutal, and constant action; it's just drowned out by aweful P2P lag. Do not buy at any price.			",40,6,0,7,8,0,12

												One of the most fun single player campaigns I've played in a hack and slash game ever, even more so if you already enjoy the W40K universe.Gameplay is solid with a decent challenge given and intuitive controls. Though not overly difficult, it is still challenging enough that you feel satisfied when you manage to gun down or hack apart the few hundred orks blocking the way to your objective.The devs have done an amazing job with the weapons. Bolters sound and feel exactly like they should when firing rounds into mobs of Greenskins, while ripping them apart with your chainsword is equally satisfying, visually and audibly. For me though nothing beats flying around in a jetpack, thunder hammer in hand, crushing heads into the cement.The rest of the game as far as atmosphere and overall feel goes is supurb, really feels like a Warhammer game and won't leave you disappointed.Storywise the game is nothing mindblowingly original as far as W40K goes but it does keep you interested until the end.  Originally meant to be a trilogy, THQ went bankrupt before they managed to make the sequels so we don't ever get to find out what happened to Captain Titus, but even so it's worth playing for the story if you're a fan of the lore.The multiplayer was fun back in the day but is completely dead now so don't get this if that's what you're looking for.I wouldn't say the replay value of this game is especially high, but I enjoyed it enough the first time through to eventually play it again a couple more times, and probably will again in the future, though your mileage may vary.If you're a Warhammer 40K fan or just of hack and slash games in general, I'd say definitely give Space Marine a go, especially when it goes on sale if you're still unsure.I give it 7 Imperial Aquilas out of 10			",227,35,5,25,14,2,30

												This is a fantastic game that is well worth the money (during one of Relic's annual sales). A must-have for any Warhammer 40k fan, as it continues Relic's tradition of trying to be as accurate as possible to the feel and spirit of the 40k universe.The gameplay is a good balance between third-person shooting and melee combat. It is challenging while still making you feel like the superhuman killing machine you are. It has a good variety of weapons, including bolters, plasma guns, lascannons, and melta weapons for ranged, and chainswords, power axes, and even thunderhammers for melee. My favorite combo is a jump pack with a thunderhammer, which allows you to smash the God-Emperor's enemies with the necessary amount of righteous fury.The music and sound design was surprisingly good, with very good sound quality and an appropriately epic tone. It has some fantastic setpieces for the levels, like giant cathedrals and bridges decked out by the Adeptus Mechanicus. In general, it has very high production values and stays true to the lore.It had me truly awestruck at times, as I am a huge fan of the 40k universe and have read tons of the books, but even people new to the franchise should appreciate the grand scale of it all.Get it as soon as it goes on sale.The Emperor protects.

												TL;DR: The epitome of Warhammer 40k in a third-person format, done completely right.+ Solid storyline befitting the WH40K universe.+ Solid mechanics that seamlessly flows from shooting to melee.+ Excellent thematic carry-overs from the written word of WH40k depicted in videogame format. Boltors feel *exactly* like how they're supposed to. Visceral combat feels exactly like how its depicted in the lore, etc.+ Pacing that leads from one segment of the Adeptus Astartes to another easily.- You play the Ultramarines, arguably one of the most boring chapters of Space Marines.- You dont get to play anything more than Space Marines.- Multiplayer is basically Horde mode vs Orcs, or Space Marines vs Chaos Space Marines. Great, but nothing more.- Ends somewhat quickly, and simply demands a sequel, that sadly will never happen as the original developers are bankrupt :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A tentative recommendation for fans of 40k and/or @ a discount.This is an old game, with elements of classic arcade in level design and game play features. This translates into linear corridor style gameplay with fixed/scripted encounters that have to be overcome via the only means possible before the area is unlocked and player can progress forwards with the level. The levels blend seamlessly into one another with cutscenes dialogues and animations delivering characterbackground and plot elements between major events and chapter ends. The single player campaign relies on an autosave checkpoint system but once played the different chapters become available for replay directly from the menu.SP levels include static defense against waves, i'll drive u shoot mobile defense, advance and clear (vast majority) and boss style arenas, and jumppack sections. There are 16 sections split across 6 chapters, which i completed within 12 hours as a casual gamer.The game controls are simple and fairly responsive albeit a little clunky in design. Gun play is as expected 1 button to shoot another to zoom another to reload and some guns have an additional quirk or feature like charge up/overheat or delayed activation. The play carries 1 pistol, 1 bolter and upto 2 specialist weapons at any point with limited ammo and pickups through the levels on all but the pistol. Periodically through the mission one will find weapon caches where they can reconfigure their gear and resupply on ammo and grenades.Melee combat is more complex 1 button to attack another to stun each weapon has its own combo animations and lastly a recharge health mechanic called execute which locks the player into a sychronised slow motion animation of varying lengths that recharges ones health a certain degree upon its completion (all enemies remain active during this time leaving the player incredibly vunerable). There are 4 melee weapons in single player, 1 of wich prevents the use of specialist weapons firing. The game feels like a console port at times, levels have invisible walls or ancle hieght impassable terrain giving one the impression of more freedom and better visuals. Certain points of the game have additional mechainics requiring one to spam a certain key or active the keys in sequence as prompted on screen. There is no jump feature as such but the inclusion of the jumppack as a mechanic means some levels/sections are more 3 dimensional by design. The graphics are functional, the faces of the characters being decent, while the armour texture and details is lacking when close up, namely dialogue scens. The levels convey the atmosphere, but won't have you stopping to take in the scenery much like some games do.The music score and sound effects are all decent, or atleast not immediately irritating after hearing the same thing ad infinitum. The voice acting and audio logs one finds are also note worthy, and while the script isn't all that it is atleast consistently delivered with the characters remaining true to themselves throughout. For those that know 40K they'll understand when i say the Titus would have been more plausable as a Spacewolf than an Ultramarine.The multiplayer is split into 2 aspects, PvP and PvE. They are however, somewhat empty at this time and requires using the autofinder so jumping on a pug game isn't easy but Steam intergration allows friend invites. Both modes can however, be launched without being filled meaning they can be self hosted as SP if one so desires. The gameplay and handling of weapons is slightly different in MP for balance reasons, as one might expect.The multiplayer also has a cosmetic customisation and skills rewards system based on various unlocks through online gamplay. This adds incentive and rewards failure in addition to success helping new players find their feet against the better equipped and more experienced community. Alas these don't work in Sp, which is to relaint upon fixed animations to allow for customisation.Played on I7, win10 64bit, GTX970, Keyboard n Mouse.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I didn't had a lot of hope for this game, I was doubting it a lot. But after playing some time, I realised how amazing it is! It seems easy, and simple, but I actually had a lot of fun kicking♥♥♥♥♥with a Spacemarine. The weapons are devastating in their own, brutal way. The campaign is a bit shorter then I expected, but it has a good plot and gameplay. I also like the difficulty setting then other shooters these days, both 3rd and 1st. You have to be careful and look around carefully so you don't get your♥♥♥♥♥beaten. This was the same for the multiplayer. At first I just charged in blindly, which resulted into me dying a lot. Speaking of the multiplayer, I haven't fully done it yet, but I can already tell it seems to be a fun experience. I have great hopes for Spacemarine and i will hope for a sequel.

												This game was a purchase on a sale, it had been on my wishlist for a while but was fairly low priority. Boy were my expectations low (what with Relic being sold) and the poor general sales of this contributing to Relic's downfall.I was surprised and delighted, and have never been more flipped when trying something new. Relic really got this spot-on. This is a way better W40K game than many others that have come before it. This is really on par with the Dawn of War series in terms of the attention to detail. As a fully controller-supported, console-style game, this plays a very differently to Dawn of War, and is like a breath of fresh air on the PC. It is not a FPS and really does play mostly in third-person, but I like this, it allows you to see the detail and revel in the bloody destruction and orc blood splatters all over you. This is third-person done right, with an over the shoulder zoom for sniping play, so you can still pull off headshots before running in chainsaw-whirring. And it is that mish-mash that makes it damned good fun.The online portion, while not well-populated on STEAM, is a sturdy, challenging defense against the hordes, and I hope more people buy this to help boost the multiplayer appeal of the game, which is surprisingly glorious havok.

												Having just finished this game i can say that it was truly enjoyable from start to finish. The characters are true to form and the storyline is typical of the 40K novels. This game doesn't pretend to be something it's not and it never tries to reach above it's station. If you are looking for a great third person splatter-fest then this game is a must. For fans of the 40K universe or just someone looking to mash bad guys in a multitude of violent and gory manouvers this is one for you. FOR THE EMPEROR!8/10 ",574,272,15,109,98,4,169

												From Relic, the same people made 40K 'Dawn of War', which is still the most popular 40K RTS. Space Marine is still the most popular shooter in the Warhammer 40K universe.It's a fantasy/military 3rd person shooter with a decent single player and a dedicated multiplayer fanbase for versus (mainly 'Seize Ground' mode) and also for horde mode (""Exterminatus"").The voice acting in the main game is a bit of an uncomfortable mix of well spoken English people and a very extreme military regime, that's a bit like Rome and *ahem* others that were influenced by them. But this is true to the tabletop games of Warhammer 40K and it's all in good fun.There are elements of gore as you slay the Orks, but whilst they're often grizzly, there's nothing truly objectionable about the visuals or the theme. It will appeal to people with less than moderate world views, but no more so than the endless shooters based in current real world conflicts. At least this is a heightened fantasy world and can just be enjoyed as a game, without being politically incorrect.Many other 40K games have tried to capture the same enthusiasm these games by Relic still enjoy, but none has a five year history of online games every day of every year.'Chaos' DLC does get played, the only one you'll want to join groups to find players for is 'Dreadnought' - there are regular arranged games for that, but if you log on randomly, you won't find a 'Dreadnought' game usually.The rest is all alive and well every day.There's no developer support, Sega took the title a little while back, but has not done anything to it.And there are no dedicated servers which means on the plus side, the game will continue so long as people wish to play. But on the minus, there are host migrations in game as it flips to find the best host - these can sometimes take a few seconds, which seem like hours in the heat of play.In all, you'll get your money's worth from this if you enjoy online shooters with a fun array of Sci-fi weapons, equivalent to pistols, shotguns and rifles in other games.Here you can level up to make your Marine better, weapons cool down or get melee abilities etc. But you can use jump packs and things right from the off.There is a skilled player base. Some hackers and the usual racism, sexism and abuse to be found in all online games, alas. But don't let that put you off a good game - there is a mute button for each player if you tire of the ""banter"" and you can happily ignore text comments if being picked on for your nationality, political views or player ability is getting in the way of the fun.There are far more friendly people than hackers and abusers. And the vast majority of your experience will be an addictive team battle arena you want to come back to :)			",171,13,3,9,0,0,3

There are a lot of enemys from simple ork to chaos space marine. You have whole arsenal of deadly weapon like classic bolter and chain sword. There is of course multiplayer which is still alive (but its mainly players with the highest 41 level). You can play Exterminatus where you and your 3 friends will fight against 21 waves of enemys on 2 or 3 maps (1 is from dlc) or play normal multiplayer which has 4-5 types of game (again 1 is from dlc). You need good internet or you will get killed through the wall and the worst thing is migration to new host or waiting for him. It destroy the fun and sometimes can even kill you (i know something about it).			",194,24,3,19,12,3,34

												PROS- The aesthetic of the game is perfect, the Space Marines exactly like they should, as do the daemons and the orks- The story line is very interesting and isn't just a ""There are bad guys here, go kill them"" sort story-The multiplayer allows for a person to not only choose from a selection of pre-made designs, but to also design their own chapter or warband-Captain Titus, while he is an Ultramarine, is not a rigid, ""the Codex Astartes doesn't say we can do this, so we shouldn't character""-While limited the selection of available weapons includes some of the best weapons available to Space Marines-The sound effects of each weapon sound realistic-Accessible to both fans of 40k and new people, without having to have a section of the game that is about universe buildingCONS-The main character is an Ultramarine (I don't dislike the Ultramarines, but there are other chapters)-The game takes place on a Forge World, but there are no Skitarii-Leandros is an example of why people hate the Ultramarines-The choice of weapons is limited-The final boss is a quick-time event-Unique armour sets only available through DLC-No Chaos campaignOverall, I think this game is very well made, despite the flaws.FOR THE EMPEROR or if you prefer FOR THE DARK GODS			",9,2,0,3,2,0,4

Melee and ranged combat integrate fairly seamlessly, everything feels weighty and powerful, and there's less twitch-headshotting so much as twitch-combat. When you engage in fights, your suvival under fire lasts longer than many other shooting games, but indecision will still wipe you out.Online community is active via groups, and the single player is certainly fun enough for a playthrough or two.

												7/10Anyone that knows me even a smidge knows that i'm a huge warhammer fan, and i enjoyed space marine quite a bit. both melee combat and ranged combat are just as viable as the other and flows seamlessly between the two, allowing for entertaining and gory combat while purging the enemies of the Emperor. The story within the campaign is decent as is the voice acting and soundtrack, and there a lots of nice little touches within the game such as even the random battlefield objects such as ammunition boxes being actual games workshop models in the present - something i thought was a cool little feature. Character development is interesting; which is why we all hate Leandros and love Sidonus/Titus.. and there are some highly unexpected plot twists, ones that you wouldn't normally suspect from warhammer! Even the warboss Grimskull is fricking awesome, likewise with the chaos lord Nemeroth.The bolter was done so extremely well that it just has to be mentioned - a doof-cannon of explosive destruction with a realistic rate of fire for such a large shell being loaded automatically and the chainsword is just as satisfying as you ""vroom"" your way through orks and chaos. In fact the entirety of the sound design is top notch, such as the heavy stomping of casual marine steps and the general atmospheric sounds. However, despite these gems within the game it does possess some things i found to be issues... - Now, while the combat in this game is rather highly acclaimed, it does not have a parry button; the only way to stop your opponent's spamfest of attacks is to stun them. This is rather...weird... as in multiplayer it's basically just two marines constantly shanking eachother and then throwing in the odd backhand to knock them back for a moment. This results in no skill needed to effectively melee..at all. It's just spam the attack button. - The game isn't too accurate to lore either. In saying that it's not exactly butchering it though. For example Lascannons only instand kill marines on headshots. If it was more accurate to the lore it would kill a marine outright. As would the plasma cannon...and melta... - THQ no longer exists and SEGA isn't doing much, so no updates apparently to fix any bugs/issues (despite myself not actually discovering any bugs but anyway) - DLC has segmented the already splintered online playerbase somewhatNow, don't let these negative words sway you from the game itself though, i found it to be quite fun, the campaign is of a suitably long length and remains fun if you play it in bursts of an hour or so, the combat is oh so much fun and last but not least...it's warhammer! What isn't to love in the grim darkness of the far future!? ""SPESS MAREEN, WAZ DAT SUPPOZED TAH HERT?""			",122,14,2,14,11,1,17

												I've played nearly every Warhammer 40k game to date but this one is easily my favorite. The combat is simple and loose but very intense and enemies come at you with everything they're got. It makes you feel like one BAMF but more than that it makes you feel like you've earned it. If you've played very many WH40k games or are familiar with them at all really, the plot will feel pretty predictable. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's weak, but honestly it's not the story that's going to keep you playing. I can't say I've encounted very many bugs in the game either. Overall it's a neat peek at the WH40k universe, a great way to get the space marine experience, and a downright excellent stress killer.As for playing online, unfortunately the player base is just about dead and only one PvP mode is actually played anymore. The game is honestly pretty underrated and most people have simply moved on over the years since it's release. Matchmaking for either PvP or co-op survival can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 45 on a bad day. On the bright side, just about everyone I've run into playing online have been really pleasant and there's very little whining and moaning like the 9 year olds you'll find populating the majority of matches in games like Call of Duty. Really it's just a bunch of WH40k nerds that just enjoy playing the game. PvP is fairly balanced, nothing like the cluster**** you'll find in similar WH40k games like Eternal Crusade. As you progress, you'll unlock new weapons you can use and all armor unlocks are cosmetic. There is a perk system but the really nice perks have to be earned with weapon and armor challenges. The effects are nice, but they don't make you vastly overpowered and it's not uncommon to see players with noob gear whooping maxed ones. Armor customization is pretty neat and all in all it's a fun challenge working towards unlocking them and building your own look.The co-op survial mode is definitely where I've had the most fun in this game. It takes a really solid team to actually make it the whole way to the end and also beat the bonus wave, but it's one hell of a ride if you do and a lot of fun with friends. If a team doesn't work together, a whole match can fall apart before you know it. If your team gets wiped out, it allows you to start over from the last ""checkpoint"" and most are more than willing to keep trying over and over to beat it. Players can drop in after it's started if someone leaves the game, which is good because it's pretty hard to beat without 4 players. Like PvP, it can take some time to find a full group through matchmaking though.Due to the lack of player base online, I highly recommend you skip the Dreadnaught and Chaos Unleashed DLCs if you buy this game. There's few enough players as it is and even less that actually have those DLCs. It's a shame because Chaos Unleashed's co-op maps are actually a lot of fun, but unless you have friends you can coordinate a game with it's just about impossible to get one going through matchmaking. I would also skip the armour set DLCs since you can customize your space marine to look nearly identical to them anyway.The Space Marine game was originally supposed to be a trilogy, but with Sega acquiring Relic and sticking mainly to strategy games, it's pretty unlikely it's ever going to happen. Personally I'd love to see it and support the idea, but if you're wondering if you should expect more it's probably safe to say no.			",259,59,3,36,23,3,55

★★★☆☆If I could describe this game in a one word, than that would be 'brown'. Not only because most of the levels are colored brown (despite these being indoors and outdoors), but also because it only seems to be monotonous in its game design (its generic and almost invisible among the hundreds of other brown gameworlds created in the last generation). Ironicly, the orcs also aren't really creative with their words as I heard ""Space Marine!"" about a hunderd times. I'd say this isn't necessarily a bad thing for a game that tries to show of a grim, dark episode of the Warhammer universe, but it does leave a lot to be desired in thematical exploration (not much to learn about the lore here) and gameplay. As for replayability, I'd recommend first time players to start the campaign on Hard, as the first two-thirds of it are a boring slog to play through.Don't get the game at full price (which is currently 20 bucks). The campaign is only about 6-7 hours long, the multiplayer is basicly dead (daily population around 60 players, as of 2017) and by now there are tons of other action games out there of the same caliber or better. I bought this game because I wanted to explore the lore a bit, but like I wrote above, it doesn't particulairy show that off here.			",104,12,3,1,16,0,3

Warhammer 40 000: Space Marine is a very good game for both, fans of the subject as well as the layman who will meet with the Games Workshop created the world for the first time. Rough, addictive action heavily sprinkled with the blood of enemies, surrounded by excellent audiovisual binding, makes a very good impression. It is a pity that the game in the end, at least in the single player mode is very limited and short, which affects its final evaluation. Hopefully Relic drew the conclusions may form another part of the game, which would be much longer and would give us a greater sense of freedom. Perhaps then we will see a real ""game of the year"".			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												Space Marine is an incredible Hack and Slash and Third Person Shooter combo. Smashing through the Orks is very enjoyable even though it can be a bit ""samey"". Even with you playing as the Ultramarines the game makes up for it by making Captain Titus a very cool character.The multiplayer is also fantastic, but unfortunately it suffers from Peer2Peer connections resulting in lots of lag. This is a real shame, because with dedicated servers the potential would be reached.Most of the DLC is useless, even the map packs, this is because if you don't have a group setting up games for them you will never find a game. I say ""useless"", but the skins are good for Space Marine dressup.Overall its extremely worth it and it might just get you into Warhammer 40k if this is your first crusade.			",164,5,1,9,8,2,34

												Warhammer 40k Space Marine is third-person shooter. You take control of Captain Titus of the Ultramarines. Story Goes Planet Graia is under attack by alien Orks and the Three Ultramarines arrive to help the situation until the fleet arrive. The story is more than kill the all the Orks in the game.Gameplay: You can engage the enemies both ranged and melee weapons. In close quarters you can make some glory kills to fill health bar. Fury ability giving the player small time to increase health and become powerful both in range attach and melee. There are 17 iconic weapons in the game that all from the Warhammer universe.Sum up this game is really enjoying especially if you know the lore of Warhammer and anyone who love third-person shooter will like this.

												Space Marine is a third-person, over-the-shoulder shooter. You play as the Adeptus Astartes Ultramarines Captain, Titus. His mission is to save the planet by doing what no human could ever do: brutally murder Orks and Chaos forces by repeatedly shoving  a chainsword in various orifices. Is this game good? Definitely. Is it fun? Fantastically so!The gameplay is your simple shooter affair: center the middle of your screen on something you want dead and pull the trigger to watch it be made so. Accompanying that is a wonderfully gory melee system using chainswords, power axes, and thunder hammers to wonderful effect. The bolter rounds feel like they punch the enemy and the melee weapons can send them careening across the map. The combat is most excellent and definitely worth the money for that, if you enjoy rampage.The story is equally compelling. While it is set in a ""parellel timeline"" where Titus is captain of the second company as opposed to Cato Sicarius, it still feels just as real of a Warhammer story. Titus is strong, dutiful, and is more than ready to destory xenos and heretics in equal measure. He comes off as abrasive, but that only adds to his character as a soldier eager for battle. The other characters, however, are not so noteworthy. The game tries to make us like them, but none of them really hit home or even provide much more than expositional dialogue. The over-arching narrative was also quite excellent, but it did feel like it went on too long and one story was abandoned for another halfway through. I understand the reason, but it really felt hollow.Now, my biggest complaint is with the difficulty, namely that there isn't any. My first playthrough was on Hard, and I performed quite admirably. The few times I did die was do to my stupid mistakes rather than the game being difficult. For me, this felt too easy. Fun, but without enough challenge. For experienced shooter players, Hard difficulty should be an easy ride. I happily recommend this game to veterans and newcomers alike. The gameplay is easy to get used to and fun to play and the story is interesting and keeps moving forward, if slowly at times. The multiplayer will also provide hours of enjoyment either before or after the campaign. Now go purge some xenos filth in the name of the Emperor!-------------------------------------------------------------------If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Warhammer 40,000 - невероятная вселенная.Все мы играли в Dawn of War и в  Dawn of War IIИ вот последнее творение разработчиков - Space MarineИгра не похожа на предыдущие.И ее особенность в том, что камера наконец-тоспустилась с неба и встала за спину ДесантникаИ теперь мы играем в шутер от третьего лица.Когда я начал компанию- скажем так, я ожидал большего.Сюжет вполне в стиле вселенной Warhammer 40,000Неверотяные постройки, здания, Титаны. Локации вполне симпотичные хоть и не замысловатые.Сами уровни коридорные, есть тайники (которые не найдет разве что слепой)Приятная и простая система боя, приятные бои от которых иногда кипит кровь.НО! Не будем забывать что это первая попытка разработчиков сделать шутер от 3-го лица.И я скажу вам они постарались на славу и выпустили игру на достойном уровне.Но почему я вам советую обязательно ее взять?Мультиплеер. О Да. Вот тут я ожидал меньшего, а получил большее.Знакомые режимы, спинди флаг, удержи точку, командный смертельный матч.Даже видел какой-то режим с Дредноутами.Вы можете выбрать разный класс. Штурмовик, опустошитель, Тактик.С 4 уровня дают выбрать отряд, а потом переодеть персонажа, изменить раскраску.Имеются комплекты брони, которые открываются с прохождением испытаний.Оружие которое открывается с новым уровнем.А в режиме экстерминатус, ооо, я промолчу)) сами испытаете этот адреналин))Говоря проще кампания простенькая но приятно греет душу, с учетом что это первая игра Warhammer от 3-го лица, можно поставить разработчикам твердую 4.Вытягивает эту игру невероятный мульитплеер где вы с братьями плечом к плечуопусташаете болтеры и окровавливаете цепные мечи.Советую к покупке и обязательной игре в мультиплеере.

The campaign gets a little repetitive and the lack of a decent final boss hurts it overall but eh..it isn't too bad.Both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes are very entertaining as well. The later levels of the coop mode become very challenging due to insurmountable odds and limited ammo. Teamwork is a must. All in all I recommend it.			",914,265,35,107,34,4,37

												Space Marine is full of action. Bloody 40K action. If you're a fan of 40K, this game is a must, even if the campaign is a bit stale. The action and feel of the weapons is this games strong point, firing a bolter and splattering orks is definately fun. The multiplayer also has a cool customization system. However, there is not much to keep a gamer entertained. The mechanics feel good - but the storyline and characters are quite weak, especially considering what is possible in the 40K universe. Only buy if you are a 40K fan, imo.			",35,6,0,9,7,1,15

												I'm not sure WHO I'd recommend this to. Hardcore 40K people will find it way too simplistic, people who aren't into 40K at all will wonder what the fuss is about. But all in all I think it's pretty good for an admittedly generic third person shooter/hack & slash. Think Gears of War minus the cover mechanic and with more focus on melee. Combat is tight and exhilarating. A little more enemy variety and more interesting boss fights wouldn't go amiss, but hey I'm not complaining. I wouldn't say it's worth the full price, but if you can catch it on sale...  It's certainly a better game than a recent 40K FPS which I shan't mention.  ",102,11,4,6,8,0,5

												Do you like 40K?  Do you like crushing your opponents?  The single player for Space Marine is a fun, short romp through the battlefield of the 40K universe fighting against orc and chaos factions.  Fun, short, and sets up well for a sequal that is unlikely to come.Multiplayer is balanced well between Chaos Marines and Space Marines.  You cannot choose which faction to play, but Chaos Marines are just a reskin of the Space Marines; so no big loss.  Weapons and equipment are identical.  There are a ton of unlocks for three different classes:  Assault, Jetpack, and Heavy.  There are many loadouts and weapons for each class, but most are locked behind an experience wall.Balance between new players and veterans is achieved by coping the loadout of the person who killed you.  If you died to a hammer-weilding jetpack player; choose to respawn with their loadout.  Died to a sniper?  Respawn with their loadout.There are also cosmetic unlocks for different armor pieces (helmet, check, gloves, etc.) gained by playing that class or faction and earning specific achievements.Overall, Space Marine was fun in single and multiplayer.  I would recommend the game to anyone who enjoys third person shooters.			",86,6,1,10,3,1,13

												I really wish there was a middle ground recommendation button... But before you become too  judgemental about my negetive recommendation, I suggest you read it first. After my game lagged to  the point of crashing to desktop, I felt it was finally time I gave my word on this game. Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine is a fun little hack n' slash style action game game which throws you  into the grim-dark world of Warhammer where you play as Captain Titus of the Ultramarines. The story  is about as good as you can expect for a Warhammer game with pretty decent gameplay for it being a  transition from Relic's normally RTS style play to a third-person shooter. The campaign isn't terribly long but not terribly short either, with unlocks for the Captain as you  go. While it could have been done better, I suppose I can't complain about what we got. After your  7-8 (at most) hour story is over, you'll pretty much be done with the game which leaves you with  either completeing the game again on a higher difficulty if you haven't already. Or playing one of  the two multiplayer modes available to you. With a good to mediocre suggestion for the story thus  far, I'm sure you can see where this is going... The EXTERMINATUS mode allows you and three other space marines to band together and fight the green  skin menace in a co-op mode where you'll be flung into an arena where you must fight through five  ways and continue to the next zone, confronting more and more difficult enemies as you go. I highly  recommend playing this with friends, as the public matches are completely random with who you get  paired with, often matching you with new or inept players or outright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. You'll usually know  what you're in for when people refuse to help you, shoot at you whenever there's a lull in the  fighting, or swipe ammo from out beneath your feet. Which leads me to the next portion. Multiplayer. Multiplayer can be fun. It can be frustrating. Too often it's frustrating. The  aforementioned people can be found most commonly here. I've yet to play a multiplayer game with a  'good' community, so I can't really hold this against Space Marine alone. Expect lots of weapon/perk  abuse with cookie-cutter loadouts and over-powered weapons with little hint to any actual game  balance to be found. Assault marines will darken the skies and tacticals will roll about the  landscapes, burning away everything with the one-hit wonder meltagun. Unless you plan on fighting  fire with fire, I suggest avoiding multiplayer. Feeling more reminiscent of Call of Duty, this  gamemode feels very 'tacked on at the last minute' than anything else in the game and offers little to  nothing new to the rest of the game apart from the ridiculous armory challenges which grant you perk  and armor unlocks for customizing your multiplayer character but unless you plan on grinding for a  very long time, they aren't something you can achieve in the short-term. Latency... I've played good games. I've played bad games. I've played games with amazing  connections, and I've played games with bad connections. And then... I've played Space Marine...  Never in my life have I played a game with such pathetic connection ability, with frequent lag and  constant 'host migrations' (Which if you plan on playing multiplayer, be prepared to view this  screen:

 A. Lot.) the lack of  dedicated servers and actual lobby browsing leaving you to the mercy of the the dice roll on whether  or not you get a good server from the two or three that ever seem available grows very tiresome very  quickly. This is the number one thing that suggests to me that multiplayer was just an afterthought  once the game was made. Overall, I would indeed Recommend Space Marine to my friends who were interested or to any  Warhammer fan, if not for the story mode alone and possible co-op. Even non-fans looking for a fun  hack n' slash could possibly enjoy it. Though I leave with an actual POSITIVE recommendation, I  won't for the $30.00 dollar price tag this game sports. While fun, the shoddy multyplayer and lack  of being able to unlock things through exterminatus mode leaving you with a short, and underwhelming  campaign and ending leaves me wondering why this game is still so pricey. If you must buy it. Please  wait for a sale. $10-$15 dollars at most.TL;DR: 6/10 - There's better, cheaper games out there, should prolly go play them insted.			",783,124,9,135,62,5,152

												Being a 40k fan, I bought this game just to have in my collection.  It turned out to be probably the best 40k game I've ever played.  It's a fun third person shooter with challenging multiper modes, which are still pretty active for an over two year old game (exterminatus is awesome!).  The game gives also a very good representation of the 40k world.  I logged an embarrassing amount of hours the first week I had this game...Two years later...Still the best 40k game in my opinion.

												Graphics are pretty good. Campaign starts out fun but gets repetitive very quick.The upgrades for your main character come at a steady pace . Story is ok i guess, there's a bit of a plot twist but i kinda expected that. The only thing that feels very satisfying are the executions( Melee Finishing Moves). Guess thats the only thing that kept me playing this game. And now the multiplayer. Mutiplayer is actually much more fun. It has the typical modes like , Capture the flag, Reach 1000 point and such. Or you can play co op with strangers or friends against waves of enemies. so to keep things short. Would i recommend this game ?Not really if you think you're only gonna  play campaign. But multiplayer? Sure, if you can find a game. Which is a bit of a problem, cause the online community is a bit scarce. ",97,5,1,8,0,0,12

												I'm not a huge Warhammer fan, Or at least I wasn't before playing this game. So I didn't really know what to expect going in . But the game did a great job of introducing me to the characters and situation, Enough for me to understand what was going on and what I should be doing right from the start. Because of this I never felt lost or overwhelmed by the chaotic action going on around me which was a huge plus.+Great Controls+Good Story+Excellent Audio Quality and Surround Positioning (5.1)+Awesome Weapons+Satisfying Gun Combat+Brutal Melee Kills have a real sense of impact+Supports High Refresh Rate Screens 120/144Hz+Good Performance no Frame Drops-Graphics are a little dated, But were good for it's time.-Game was kind of short at around 6 hoursVery impressed with this game and can highly recommend it to others.

												When I first heard about this game, I wanted it. I was finally getting an action game from Warhammer instead of a typical RTS that usually happens with Warhammer games. I bounced up and down in joy, I flew across the room and hit my face against a door. In happiness.But anyways, I was a huge fan of the Warhammer games, and I wanted this game. I picked it up during the 2012 Christmas Sale, and haven't regretted it once. It's one of the few games where I go back and play it after finishing the game. I loved this game, so much. The gameplay involves you slicing orks, stomping a body and making it explode, removing limbs entirely, and just for lack of trying, you can blow their heads off. With a sword. It's one of the few games where it combines melee and ranged combat fairly seamlessly (There are a few holes here and there.), where it makes you feel like neither the melee or the ranged is overpowering the other. I played through the campaign, where I was expecting to just use melee, but that was not the case. I ended up using a variety of ranged weapons to get through the game.The healing system is rather interesting for this game. You have shields that regenerate out of combat (Like in Halo, for lack of a better comparison.) but your health doesn't regen out of combat. You have to do special kill moves to regenerate health. These can include shoving a chainsword through an Ork's body then moving it upwards and removing pretty much their entire spinal cord. They can also include exploding an ork's face. With your foot. There are some things that could be changed though to make it a more enjoyable experience. For example, you regain the health after the kill move, and you can be killed during the animation. There's no way to cancel the move, but for the most part this doesn't get in the way too much.This game really made me feel like I could take on an entire horde of Orks by myself and come out barely scratched. I also did that in the game. However, it has a checkpoint system that could be vastly improved. Or at least make cutscenese that you can skip. They stick a checkpoint before an unskippable cutscene then shove you into a fight you could die fairly quickly in, and you have to watch the cutscene again. That's one of the only design flaws.When I heard there weren't going to be anymore games after this, I was super bummed. I was hoping for Space Marine sequels even after THQ died. And then I read an article saying it had been canceled. Even if we didn't get any sequels, we got an amazing first game.In short, I loved it. This is one of my most favorite games of all time.

			SPOILERS! Critical Max does a summary of all the best, important and funny moments in his warhammer 40k Space marine playthrough.		

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=279190745This game looks stunning.Environments ranging from the doors of the Manufactorum straight to the Titan Invictus itself you will experience some of the most well crafted settings you could ask for in a WH40K game.GameplaySpace Marine is a 3rd person shooter/hack and slash. The melee is some of the most satisfying ive ever seen in a game and it works incredibly well with the provided weapons. Hacking through your enemies with a power axe or ripping them to literal shreds with a chainsword you will not be disappointed with the melee system in place here. There's alse an execution mechanic that you'll be constantly using to replenish your health in the longer battles.The game isn't just hack and slash though. You also have a fair variety of ranged weapons including but not limited to,the Stalker Pattern Boltgun,the Plasma Cannon,and the Storm Bolter. All of the ranged weapons have a satisfying kick that you would expect from a 40K game.Co-ophttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=305262741Space Marine features a co-op ""Exterminatus"" mode.The mode itself features either chaos marines or space marines(depending on if you're playing the DLC or not) holding out against waves of enemies on one of two different missions sets,Assault on Hab Center Andreas or Escape from Kalkys Facility.The mission sets include 4 different arenas with 5 waves in each.Multiple small objectives are inserted every little while as well. The objectives are mainly just hold a point for 2 minutes or something like that. There's also challenges that pop up during gameplay such as ""kill 20 enemies in 10 seconds"" or ""kill 5 shoota boys in 15 seconds"". ConsMultiplayerI personally didnt care too much for the multiplayer.It gets stale rather quick due to there being only around 5 maps and 2 objective types.The maps make up in quality what they lack in numbers but still its just not enough to keep the gameplay from becoming stale.StoryThis is more of a middle ground.The story wasn't bad but it sure was incredibly average and the story ended on a cliffhanger. That wouldn't be a problem if THQ hadn't gone bankrupt and the 2 other planned games in the series been cancelled. As it stands the story is just average. Average characters,average dialogue,and an infuriating ending.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming ",756,153,6,109,62,4,159

												Space Marine is a fun hack and slash/ 3rd person perspective(the camera is right behind your' character) shooter game set in the Warhammer 40000 sci-fi universe. The game is simple, intense and sometimes frustrating, and makes you feel like a mighty astartes without going overboard. For example, when you walk or run, you can hear the booming footsteps of your character, but it doesn't sound cheesy or deafening, and the weapons seem godly powerful, but again not cartoonish. the music is instrumental, and pretty good, especially the more battle themes, but there is no sound galery, something that Is definately a good idea. The game doesn't have a save file system, but there are many checkpoints that you can start from to replay a certain part. A lot of running between fights, but there is plenty of detail to examine, some of it gruesome, but truly paints the grimdark setting well. In the beginnning, u can look up and see ships continuously getting shot down, gunfire and explosions in the distance. The ""voice of Graia"" the voice that anounces things like when you get a new weapon sounds callous and serious for example, lines like ""Public disturbances will NOT be tolerated"", help to paint the grim, brutal sci-fi setting. The final boss is a let down gameplay wise, but the story makes up for it. You feel like a hero, arriving in the imperial guard's darkest hour to save the day, and the cutscenes and dialogue portray this well. Titus is a true hero, doing what is right, even if he will be betrayed by comrades and punished by the inquisition for it.			",11,1,0,0,1,0,0

												Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a game that involves the Ultramarines, Orcs and Daemons. The overall of the storyline without spoilers is for Space Marine to take back the planet that the Orcs have conquered. This review is conducted in a manner where I have not played any Warhammer 40,000 games, and Space Marine is my first one, so I would not know if there is a continuing storyline. This review does not contain Multiplayer comments, only single player.Campaign: Space Marine includes a solid campaign. The campaign clocks in for me at 8.5 hours on ""normal"" difficulty. As stated without spoilers, the elements of the orcs, the ultra marines and eventually the daemons add a lot of twists to the storyline that make the game interesting. Throughout the campaign, you get that feeling that ""oh wow, the game is about to finish and this is a great way to finish it"", but it extends to another chapter, which is good, however whilst that happens a few times, it does drag. The ending was strong and gave me excitement for a new Warhammer, which most likely will not happen. The campaign involves sections that overwhelm the player (and you know, make the player respawn) and gives a strong surprise factor in certain scenarios. The boss battles are cool due to the gameplay (more on that in a little bit) that may make boss battles repeatitve, but a fun experience.The cutscenes in Space Marine are above-average to good. Some cutscenes intrigue me (especially the earlier campaign cutscenes due to seeing the environment in Space Marine), other cutscenes bore me as in my opinion, I got the same thought of ""same old, same old"". In saying that, some cutscenes are repeatitive and predictable. Another criticism of cutscenes is that it is disjointed. For example, before a cutscene, I am holding a Power Axe, the cutscene happens, I am holding a Chainsword. To add to this, the cutscene in a few particular scenes did not correlate with the gameplay at all. For example, in one cutscene I was beaten up (minor spoiler) and the cutscene finishes and it is like nothing happened, it was ridiculous and happened very occasionally in the campaign.Gameplay: The gameplay in Space Marine is very good. Using Melee is basically hack and slash, which is very fun. The gun gameplay is pretty cool with the sounds, look and gunfights in the game, which I enjoy. Again, the main criticism of this section is that whilst hack and slash is fun, it gets dull further into the game. The involvement of jet packs added another layer to gameplay in this game, and created refreshment in the campaign.In the final mission of the campaign, the gameplay involved was different than seen throughout the campaign, and I say it was actually very strong. Without spoilers, it involves flying and punching and I found this to be awesome, considering I don't play many games that have that sort of gameplay involved.Negative Comments: Space Marine contains quite a few bugs, some very visible, some not visible at all to some, but visible to I. The other negative comments have been explained above with the gameplay, cutscenes, and campaign.  Whilst the pros outweigh the cons in Space Marine, the cons impact the game more than expected.Overall: It is a very solid game, filled with bugs galore, but a fun experience. For I that was introduced to Warhammer 40,000 through Space Marine, I enjoyed a refresh from the typical FPS campaigns, but it is a genre I am not still not eager to play. My friend purchased a Humble Bundle which included Warhammer series, and for Steam's price of $39.99, I personally would not recommend it. If I had to purchase this game again after playing it, I would not purchase it for higher than $29.99. I feel this is a fair price point because I have not checked out MP, and considering this game is four years old, no one most likely plays MP. I don't know about the modes so I cannot comment extensively, however older games I tend to purchase knowing I can only play the campaign, and don't have an overly interest in MP. If you play through the campaign on all difficulties, the player can probably get about 30+ hours out of this game. 7/10.UPDATE #1: I have just found out that there is two co-op modes in Multiplayer (one was patched in, other has to be purchased for $12.99) meaning with four people, you can probably get an extra few hours out of the game.Also to mention, all DLC is multiplayer-based according to a forum post.----Thanks for reading my review!

												Honestly, I have to say this game is amazing. Graphics are stupendous. The plot for the campaign is great. I think it was all really well put together! Except for one thing. Updating it is like waiting to get to the finish line 100 miles away running to that end on a sheet of superglue. Not much has come recently I can't expect it, but for what its worth its a great game...			",35,2,0,0,2,0,4

												Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is definitely the best game of last month and maybe the best game of 2011 (if you close your eyes and forget about Deus Ex: Human Revolution that is). Kratos from God of War has been dethroned, badassery has a name and its name is Titus. Play it, you will have a unique experience. 10/10			",1240,350,64,132,90,15,216

												I am going to say first that looking for all the aspects it's a good game, but i do not recommend buying for the price at this tiime. The campaign is pretty good, you feel like a space marine. Good looking enviroments, hordes of enemies, a decent variety of weapons. Captain Titus doesn't know fear or the meaning of impossible or defeat. He is unstoppable. The history is linear, you don't have any choices at the entire game.  Even with this, it's a good campaign. Now, let's talk about the Multiplayer. There is all the weapons. 3 classes of spaces marines, achiviements that let you unlock porwefull upgrades to weapons and armors to customize the look of your space marine. Ok, that's the good part.The bad part is a few maps and, the most important, there is no dedicated server.  The multiplayer uses P2P,  for me it's impossible to play.  I lost the count of how many times i got killed behind a wall, or a grende exploded while i was flying. I stopped playing Multiplayer.So, summarizing, buy for the right price, the campaign is good and the multiplayer sucks.I hope that  I could help.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is build on the Warhammer 40k universe and is an absolute win. Warhammer 40k's space marine is a 3rd person shooter with a great story and epic awesomeness of war and explosions. The only thing about the game that makes me annoyed is how underrated he is.the online gameplay is also awesome with many different matches in the mighty space marines vs. the demonic chaos marines.the game is extremely gory so if you are weak for blood  then you should not play this game.If you are into games who have a great story and 3rd person shooters then I recommend this game for you.9,7/10''This game is incredible''-Sigthor ",71,5,0,7,2,0,13

												What happens when you combine a surprisingly good interpretation of a(most dull voted) marine chapter, combine it with a pretty fore-seeable plot from the get-go & action that is second to none?Nothing stale, I assure you. - Where this game excels is its rock-solid gameplay, ""beginner to 40k"" friendly story writing, with a killer ending that makes you crave for more. This game is a hidden gem in the ""3 person view"" games.I hated Gears of War/other 3PV games, this one though... is a whole different story. Every shot you fire from a pistol or a ""boltgun"" you can feel as it connects with your enemy. Heads pop and blood flies wherever you strike at.- I only wish Relic would have had the opportunity to continue this, as the ending of the game really sticks with you, on an emotional level.Do not play on the easy mode though, stick with the Normal(its not harder, its more enjoyable).

												Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a third-person shooter set in the universe of Warhammer 40,000 that follows one captain of the Ultramarines, Titus, on his mission on the Forge World Graia, which is under heavy attack by a Ork horde seeking to posses the powerful weapons built in the planet's factories. Later in the game, Titus and his two accompanying Ultramarines, Sidonus and Leandros, must also face the threat of a Chaos Warband lead by a dangerous Chaos sorcerer named Nemeroth.The main beef of Space Marine's gameplay is using the weapons you are given tocut through the hordes of enemies preventing you from advancing and then proceed in the levels. You are given both long ranged weapons (like pistols or sniper rifles) and close quarters tools (starting from a chainsaw and arriving at a huge electrified mallet): you must learn to switch between the two constantly, given you'll face various kinds of enemies (some of them dangerous on the long distances while others extremely weak if chopped down in close combat). Each weapon has different versions that are unlocked advancing in the game, each with its pros and cons. On top of his health pool, Titus can take advantage of a recharging shield that can protect him against some of the enemy fire and a super mode of some sort: the mode is charged by dishing out damage and, whenever unleashed, allows you to recover health over time and aim at enemies in slow-motion. Finishing enemies when they are weak also allows you to boost your health.The main campaign is extremely faithful to the Warhammer 40,000 universe, both in design of the environments and characters and the references made to the general lore of the series. It lasts for aboutsix or eight hours or so and, aside from fighting your way through Graia, you can find hidden servo-skulls bearing audio recordings that further expand the game's story. There are three different difficulties (easy, normal and hard), but I'd say that even the normal mode manages to be challenging enough.Warhammer 40,00: Space Marine also spots a rather interesting multiplayer mode. You can either play as a Space Marine or a Chaos Marine, and the game offers a customization menu that allows you to deeply personalize your marine (armor pieces, colours, insigna, ...). The multiplayer mode offers several game modes, the same you could expect into a big retail multiplayer shooter: capture the flag, capture the control point, ... The mode also features co-op missions. The player actually makes progress in multiplayer thanks to a level system, unlocking new armor pieces and/or weapons and perks as he/she gains more experience. As I'm writing this review and four years after the game's release, Space Marine's multiplayer is still really populated.Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine, along with the Dawn of War series, is a great example about how a complex series like Warhammer 40,000 can be boiled down in a rather charming game capable of offering a great time both to the fans of the series and newcommers just wanting to enjoy some good third-person shooting action			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

												If there is one thing Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine succeeds at, it's making you feel like a powerfull ultramarine!The whole weaponry, melee weapons and jetpack combo really help empowering the player and feeling like a war machine.The world is beautifull, the scenery and enviroment really impressive and grandiose.It is a shame that such effort and details were not put into the characters and story.The people you encounter are all bland, with monotone voices and no expressions.The story is also very predicable, I mean laughably predictable.Hopefully, some really epic moments here and there help making the game interesting.What is hard forgive, is a last boss, that simply is quick time action.let that sink in for a moment!I do recommend this game for anyone who like a very simple hack and slash type game and are fan of the warhammer 40k world.If you do not intend to play but wish to see only the best, funniest and important story moment of the whole game, all edited with added special effect and commentaries, make sur to take a look at this video I made.Warning: SPOILERS!

												This game came out a long time ago, but it is still a visceral, thematic, Bleak, Gothic exploration of the Future of Mankind. One of the few games that made me feel I was actually a powerful character in a setting that could dispose of smaller foes with ease, while still keeping the larger threats imposing and honestly dangerous. Players of moderate skill should expect to die once or twice on the normal mode, but even veterans may struggle with the harder modes. It is not without it's flaws, but none of them managed to subtract from my enjoyment of playing the game for long.			",234,48,3,33,11,2,65

Review For Warhammer 40,000: Space MarineReview by: DEHUPros :- Good graphics- Great Story- Good voice actors- Fantastic controlsCons :- The game a bit too short.Review :Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a Third Person Shooter with great story and great gameplay.The game follows a Command Squad of three of the Ultramarines, 2nd Company Commander and playable character Captain Titus, his immediate subordinate Veteran Sergeant Sidonus, and a relatively inexperienced and by-the-book Tactical Marine named Leandros.Initially upon arrival the squad provide assistance to the outnumbered and overrun Imperial Guard regiments fighting on the planet's surface, which after the loss in battle of all higher-ranking officers are now being led by the sole surviving junior officer, Second Lieutenant MiraThe Space Marines then move on to continue with their own mission and, amidst securing the Titan Invictus, a weapon that can destory the orcs. The titan need a power source that can found in a reactor. Titus retrieves it and activates the Psychic Scourge, but the Orcs doesn't die, but a Warp Gate to the world of Chaos and unleaches a horde of demons.Later the Chaos Lord Nemeroth emerges from the portal. Using his Warp powers, he subdues the Space Marine squad as Inquisitor Drogan arrives via lift and approaches Nemeroth, revealing his allegiance to the Chaos Lord.The Scourge opened a growing Warp portal around the Orbital Spire, allowing Chaos forces to pour in; seeing this, Titus forms a plan to destroy the portal and the Spire by using one of the Titans they had secured earlier. The Titan Invictus is brought to full activation by the Power Source, and destroys the Spire. However, Sergeant Sidonus is killed by Lord Nemeroth, and the Power Source is stolen and taken to the floating remains of the Spire.The reinforcement fleet now having finally arrived, including a company of Blood Ravens Space Marines as well as the rest of Titus's company and large numbers of Imperial Guard, Titus leads them in an attack through the remaining Chaos forces to stop Lord Nemeroth from performing a ritual to ascend to the status of a Daemon Prince using the power of the deviceNemeroth has partially ascended to Daemonhood when Titus finally faces him again; both are knocked off the spire in the struggle, and the Captain defeats him in single combat while falling towards the ground. He then breaks the experimental device in half with his hands. Titus survives the exposure to the raw Warp energy again, and is rescued by a Thunderhawk dropship before he can impact the ground.The end scene of the game involves a new Imperial Inquisitor by the name of Thrax, accompanied by Leandros and escorted by several Black Templar Space Marines, who places Titus under arrest. Leandros believes that his Captain has been corrupted by Chaos, based on his resistance to warp forces.Additional Infomation :Developer: Relic EntertainmentPublisher: THQ (former), Sega (current)Genre: TPS, Released on Playstation 3: September 6, 2011 Released on Xbox 360: September 6, 2011Released on Steam: 9. sep 2011Follow my Curator page :http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/This review is written for :The Panda's Corner ",256,30,6,50,25,0,38

Titus retrieves it and activates the Psychic Scourge, but the Orcs doesn't die, but a Warp Gate to the world of Chaos and unleaches a horde of demons.Later the Chaos Lord Nemeroth emerges from the portal. Using his Warp powers, he subdues the Space Marine squad as Inquisitor Drogan arrives via lift and approaches Nemeroth, revealing his allegiance to the Chaos Lord.The Scourge opened a growing Warp portal around the Orbital Spire, allowing Chaos forces to pour in; seeing this, Titus forms a plan to destroy the portal and the Spire by using one of the Titans they had secured earlier. The Titan Invictus is brought to full activation by the Power Source, and destroys the Spire. However, Sergeant Sidonus is killed by Lord Nemeroth, and the Power Source is stolen and taken to the floating remains of the Spire.The reinforcement fleet now having finally arrived, including a company of Blood Ravens Space Marines as well as the rest of Titus's company and large numbers of Imperial Guard, Titus leads them in an attack through the remaining Chaos forces to stop Lord Nemeroth from performing a ritual to ascend to the status of a Daemon Prince using the power of the deviceNemeroth has partially ascended to Daemonhood when Titus finally faces him again; both are knocked off the spire in the struggle, and the Captain defeats him in single combat while falling towards the ground. He then breaks the experimental device in half with his hands. Titus survives the exposure to the raw Warp energy again, and is rescued by a Thunderhawk dropship before he can impact the ground.The end scene of the game involves a new Imperial Inquisitor by the name of Thrax, accompanied by Leandros and escorted by several Black Templar Space Marines, who places Titus under arrest. Leandros believes that his Captain has been corrupted by Chaos, based on his resistance to warp forces.Additional Infomation :Developer: Relic EntertainmentPublisher: THQ (former), Sega (current)Genre: TPS, Released on Playstation 3: September 6, 2011 Released on Xbox 360: September 6, 2011Released on Steam: 9. sep 2011Follow my Curator page :http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/This review is written for :The Panda's Corner ",256,30,6,50,25,0,38

												Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, while quite underrated and unplayed, is quite a fantastic game. It's blend of genres make it quite unigue when it comes traditional Third Person Shooters ( I know there are other melee based TPS games like Bayonetta ). Though it is not without it's flaws, the variety of game modes means there is something for everyone. Want a great story? Play campaign, want some good team based action? Exterminatus is for you ( PLaying with randoms can leave you with  afeeling of RAGE!!! sometimes ). And of course there is the multiplayer, which in my opinion isn't the strongest part of the game.The setting and sound design for some people might be considered a bit dull but for any 40K fan it could be considered some of, if not the best in any 40K game to date. The color scheme is a lot of browns and greys but that fights in nicly with the grimdark setting. We also finally have decent sounding bolters for once, they actually sound like powerful weapons they are supposed to be.There are, as I said, a few things wrong with it. For traditional Codex fans there will be some small problems such as the obscene amount of damage you can take from even the weakest Orks and the use of Lascannons in an anti-infatry role. Such things are quite minor and shouldn't stop you from ejoying the game. Other problems can just be the extreme level of difficulty in both the campaign and Exterminatus. enemies can take quite a few shots before they go down and in return, as  i said before, they can take you done rather quickly if you don't play smart. In contrast to other TPS games, Space Marine has no cover system. As such you must use your mobility to your advantage, with the use of combat rolls, sprint and later on (in limited fashion) the jump pack.In Exterminatus and Multiplayer, the game is actually a class based game, meaning that you can choose one of three classes to play. In these modes you play as either Space Marines, fighting for the Imperium. And the Chaos Space Marines, fighting for the glory of the dark gods. Both sides are exactly the same in terms of classes and abilites. The three calsses are: The Assault Marine/Raptor, Devastator Marine/Havoc and the Tactical Marine/Chaos Space Marine. Each class has different parks, abilities and weapons. The Assault Marine/Raptor is the master of close combat, is armed with a close combat weapon and a pistol and has a  jump pack. The Devastator/Havoc is a beast at long range, armed with the heaviest armor and heaviest weapons, he can however be beaten quite quickly in close combat without support. And the Tactical Marine/Chaos Space Marine is a very flexible all rounder, with neither the close ranged power of the Assault Marine/Raptor, or the longe range fire power of the Devastator Marine/Havoc. He does however have a lot of options and weapons that neither of the other classes has access to.There are also an extreme amount of cosmetic customization options. you can have up to five saved custom marine appearences for both the Space Marines and the Chaos Space Marines. There are also a lot of different parts of your armor that can be customized from the helmet and chest plate, to individual legs, arms and pauldrons. Relic also released some DLC  specific sets of armor including: Blood Angel, Salamander, Legion of the Damned, etc for the loyalists. For the traitors there are sets like: Death Guard, Iron Warriors and Emperor's Children. these were not only colour schemes but had custom bits of armor like the Legion of the Damned skull helmet and the salamander shect plate with Drake hide attached. These were unfortunately unchangeable but the community did figure out a workaround.There are a few over sights and missed opportunities, such a s a lack of vehicular combat. There are a  few turret sections in the campaign and there was a DLC released that let you play in a dreadnaught but that is largely considered unbalanced and is rarely played now. Also the absence of dedicated servers means that multiplayer is often plagued with constant latency issues. And the combat can be consdiered repetative.tl;dr+ fantastic campaign+ setting and sound design+ varied roles in multiplayer and Exterminatus+ customization options- repetitive gameplay- general difficulty- lagg issues- lack of players for multiplayer modesIn summary: Just play it. Rent it, buy it, borrow from a friend. Just try it for yourself, it's still a fun game despite it's flaws. ",73,2,1,16,4,0,22

												Runs and looks 10 times better on pc. 360 had frame rate drops, but the pc is smooth and has overall better graphics. Other than graphical, there is a larger community for multiplayer on PC, and when the connection is good it is so much more crisp than the xbox 360's lag. Recommend this to anyone who is a fan of good shooters, and anyone who loves Warhammer 40k			",24,2,0,6,0,0,8

												A beautiful game that met it's end at a flurry of unfortunate circumstances - circumstances both unforseeable and otherwise. It's an audacious game, bringing to the table strikingly personal and beautiful graphics, a wildly bloody slash-and-bolter combat system, and the grinding, metal bang and fleshy, ripping spletch that I've come to synonymously expect from Warhammer. The story may be dry, the mulitplayer a sad husk with no dedicated servers, and the smell of lost opportunity a bit pungent on the coarsing winds of ash and char; but it's still a must for any 40K fan. Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is simply one of the most fun action titles I've ever played. It has really great gameplay that made me feel like a tanky space marine. The class-based multiplayer is pretty well-balanced, and the horde mode is challenging, and great for playing with friends.Pros:Really cool weapons.Plays well with a gamepad or kb/m.Really smooth gameplay jumping between ranged and melee.Pretty good plot that fits well in WH40K universe.Good flavor in fighting orks vs. chaos - orks have overwhelming numbers, chaos have beefy units to rival your own strength.Jump pack scenes work well.Cons:Lack of split-screen local co-opIt's a console port, and this shows up in the menu design, graphics options, and obnoxious checkpoint save system.No moddabilityAt this point they should remove the grind for unlocking stuff in MP mode, at least if you just want to go play co-op.The entire game, including a really tough mid-game boss, has consistent mechanics and skill use, then the final boss is just a game of simon says. That could've been better.Sometimes platforms/wall clipping doesn't quite match the visual			",233,55,13,21,22,4,42

												Is a game really well, for those coming from dawn of war 1, this game will love that envelops you in its universe and feel really a space marine, ambience is good, modelling of the scenarios is good, but what is really good is the multiplayer mode both Exterminatus classic as chaos unleashed, the possibility to a noble or Warchief orko face is great in chaos mode is the mode more hardcore of exterminatus, you get to fight a Killa kan orko and all the nobles and chiefs orkos simultaneously... If you want more than a good time this game is for you....(Lore)			",44,5,0,0,3,0,2

												This is the first review I have ever written, but this game needed it.  I haven't played a 3D shooter in 16 years because the genre became so stale.  But, I love the 40k universe so I thought I would try this title.  normally I play MOBAs and RPGs.  TLDR - you will have jaw dropping moments throughout the course of this game.  Space Marine has - 1. epic space marine combat you might envision from the books.  full on, hard core, kick butt action.  2. Titans.  yes.  there is a titan in the game and I wont spoil anything.  it was cool.  I want more titan action though if they have ever make space marine 2.3.  Holy crap... you are a gunner on a storm bird in one mission, it was epic.4. good warhammer 40k story line.  inquisition, imperial army, responding to a distress call from a hive world invaded by orcs.  Things get dark and the plot thickens.5. totally awesome, mind blowingly huge visuals you probably envision in the 40k universe.  the game puts you right into them.  Huge manufactorem, drop pods screaming out of the sky, chain swords, bolters, las rifles, melta guns6. I want more space marine games.  too bad the maker went bankrupt.  and too bad I just found this game now.  cons:Would like better script and voice acting in the future.  Main characters were ok.  leandros... not good.  recommendations if the game makers ever read this review.  why not borrow a script author from the horus heresy, like dan abnett?  I think there are people dying for good story content.  same reason game of thrones TV show is successful.  it is rich in content and story with a great cast.			",3,0,0,7,3,0,10

												Even though, as a player, you are put into the shoes, or rather the power armour, of a Space Marine who belongs to the most boring and overrated of all SM chapters, the game is a pretty solid WH40k action-packed experience.PROS:+ ravaging through hordes of enemies+ you feel like an unstoppable Adeptus Astartes juggernaut+ atmospheric soundtrack+ the multiplayer is fun(despite P2P-based hosting and quite limited playerbase)CONS:- the combat mechanics are sluggish and inaccurate- the plot could have been more engaging- the f!@#$ng Ultramarines; there are so many more SM chapters deserving the spotlightWhat can I say, WH40K:SM is a relaxing and enjoyable Emperor-infused journey.Do you like smashing the Orks' teeth in?Do you like sporting purity seal adorned shiny power armours?Do you like the WH40K pathos?Go and get them, Space Marine.""Life is the Emperor's currency, spend it well.""

												You can play as the freaking Adeptus Astartes, what is not to love? Though, seriously, I am friggin' sick of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ultramarines...Beyond that, the story is forgettable and the characters flat. Single Player doesn't really have much to offer aside from the beauty of WH40k rendered with loving detail. The grandness of the universe is well represented; everything is huge, and even the towering Astartes feel small.The multiplayer, both cooperative and adversarial, is much more interesting than the SP.Exterminatus, though very flawed, is a fun take on Wave Survival/""Horde Mode"". With more polish and care, it coud have stolen the show, but as is, it remains obviously what it is: a tacked on extra.Versus, on the other hand, it extremely fun. Yes, Peer 2 Peer across oceans is lagtastic. Yes, it could use some balance. Yes, the maps are stale after 2 years. But it's still the most fun I have in gaming, and it's the only game that lets me play as the Adeptus Astartes. I can't help but love it.In all, the game is a wonderful first step for Relic into the Third Person Shooter genre, and is amazing for the studio's first ever action game, but whether or not they will continue this trend under SEGA remains to be seen...It should be noted that the animation quality in Space Marine is top notch, AAA, 5 star, all that and bag of chips. As a person who appreciates aesthetics in motion (i.e. good animations), I find it an absolute joy to watch.			",293,29,2,47,22,1,36

												Chainswords, Space British, and Orks with a K. Those are a few things to expect when playing 40k Space Marine. You play as Titus captain of the Ultramarines, and wow your whole team just look so badass. You have giant shoulder pads with skulls on them, you rip guys apart to get health back, you don't use cover because ♥♥♥♥ that and your dude just looks even cooler by the end of the game. The game starts off with you flying over this planet getting ready to land. When you spot Ork airships flying by. Then Captain Titus (you) makes the call and says were jumping, so that we can take out those airships. You do and you blow them up and of course you get separated form your squad. You then go out to find them and last survivors. The story defiantly takes a turn that I didn't really see coming, and it was a good one it changes up the story and the gameplay. For the most part of the game it just has you ripping through guy and tearing them apart weather it be with your Chainsword or with your guns, and it feels like they have mastered ripping guys apart because they just blow up in to the mist of red when you shoot them our when you gut them in half with your sword.  Just going into a group of 100 Orks and just coming out the other end covered in blood feels amazing, looks so cool,and is so much fun.    The story mode will take you about 8 to 10 hours to beat if you play it on normal. It feeds you new stuff pretty frequently so it feels a little different now that you have this new gun or this new melee weapon, it never gets dull I'll just say that.Now on to the multiplayer, which has variety of different modes 2 competitive, deathmatch and a point capture mode, then it also has a horde mode with waves of enemies and different objectives. It is class based you have a melee, a stationary gunner guy, and just you all around gun guy. It plays pretty well and has the call of duty carrot on a stick aspect of unlocking stuff as you progress but not only do you unlock weapons and perks but you also unlock a bunch of cosmetic items through achievements and leveling up, which personally I spent a lot of time just dressing up both my dudes. One of the main issues I had with it was that in the beginning it felt like I was really at a disadvantage, because it was just getting killed instantly in some cases. That might turn some players off but stick with it you unlock a lot of cool stuff from new stuff like a jetpack to all the guns you had access to in the campaign.The game is a great package with a satisfying campaign, some great multiplayer fun.

												I'm going to start this review with how impressed I am at this game's optimization. I have a crappy PC with a dual core processor, and this game is frequently hitting 60 fps with some infrequent stuttering here and there when the particle effects and environments get a little thick. Even at the lowest graphical settings, this game still looks good, so props to Relic on making this run like a dream on PC.Now, to the review proper. A lot of 3rd person shooters focus far too much on stale cover-based shooting, ever since Gears of War did it relatively okay. Space Marine says to hell with cover and lets you tromp around and stomp the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of xenos and heretics while using movement to keep yourself alive.It uses a system where you have regenerating shields, but your actual health has to be recovered by getting into the thick of things and execute enemies when they're stunned. You need to make intelligent use of your dodges and know when to stun certain enemies and keep them out of combat while you work on the other guys in melee. While the combos themselves aren't particularly complex or challenging, they provide a surprising depth in your approach to close combat.As for the shooting, Space Marine gets it right. If you're going to commit yourself to mid or long-range combat, you need to be constantly mindful of what pillars or walls you can use to peek around and use to run through, breaking up the enemy's fire. You can't just sit in once place forever, since the AI will know what you're trying to pull, and will make use of grenades to get you in their line of fire. They will also attempt to flank you and surround you all of the time.This, combined with the melee combat system, makes for an actually challenging game that has you constantly scanning your surroundings and flushing out your enemies. There's hardly ever a dull moment, and each encounter tests you on what you've been learning throughout the game. While newbies are going to be frantically hunting for a spot to rest and be on edge in every battle, more experienced players can make it look hilariously easy.Sound DesignThe bolters are so damn punchy in this game. Everything is punchy. Even the steps taken by you and your fellow space marines sound massive and thud like you'd expect. Every aspect of this game sounds authentic, and never leaves you dissatisfied. This is also part of what keeps the shooting aspect of the game so fun, as the bolter makes thunderous noise and your enemies blow apart in juicy blood splatters.When it comes to the narrative, it is standard 40k fare, but the characters themselves are, for me, the most memorable thing in the story. Mark Strong does a great job voicing Captain Titus, and the captain himself is a pretty badass dude. The Ultramarines are often mocked as ponces and an obnoxious, uptight chapter. While this does hold true in many cases, Titus shows the best attributes of the chapter, and embodies the ideals of his primarch. Hell, I'd say the guy is the spitting image of Guilliman.Sidonus is a cool guy, Leandros is a whipped little ♥♥♥♥♥, the Blood Ravens make an appearance along with the Black Templars, the IG is as manly as ever, and the the chaos lord is actually kind of cool; while he doesn't match up to the likes of Eliphas, he's still leagues better than other chaos lords we've seen in the past. The ork warboss, Grimskull, is probably one of my favorite orks ever, right behind Gorgutz 'Ead 'Unter.Overall, I'd say that this is a game that certainly does 40k justice, and is a great starting point for anyone who wants to get more into the lore side of the setting. As a game, it's pretty damn good, and keeps me coming back constantly with its campaign and multiplayer. I would love to see Relic revisit Space Marine sometime in the near future, and finish it off proper, since the cliffhanger at the end is downright criminal. So, yes, I do recommend Space Marine.

												This review is single-player-centric.The feeling of power from playing this game is hugely satifying. The weapons are all exactly as you want them to be, and balanced to boot. The combat mechanics encourage fighting you way out of situations rather than hiding, and are perfect for maintaining flow. Graphics and combat animations are excellent, and lend themselves well to the environments. The story is also good; I found myself wishing for a sequal to continue the narrative, not just for more glorious combat!Highly reccomended.			",88,7,0,10,13,1,41

												So, I have this to ask of you. Why haven't you gotten this? Have you at least tried out the demo? No? *Smacks you upside the head* Go try it! It's a gore filled, bloody as Hell (No, wait, it's Orks. But oh, how they bleed.), and it's a VERY simple control system that'll have you taking on Hordes of Orks in maybe a minute after the start.And speaking from my experience on the 360 version, the Online is INCREDIBLY fun (Though I was limited due to buying the game used), and, believe it or not, I could find people. Yes. Actual people. In ALL the game modes I had. Exterminatus, Versus, the likes. Even though I was level 5 most of the time, I was doing a large amount of work for my team, keeping them well placed. I can only wonder what I would've been like at a higher level, with more weapons... <3And then I get to the campaign. It's a camping trip gone astra- And I'm going to stop there. No, it's a typical Warhammer 40,000 story. Orks, suddenly, *Censored*. Whoah. Since I'm still new to the series, it caught me off guard, but, hey. It's still well done. The final fight is a gory mess of blood and fun and gore. But that final game movie, it's a painful one. The people in Warhammer 40,000, especially Space Marines, are♥♥♥♥♥holes. No bars hold,♥♥♥♥♥holes. GLORIFIED♥♥♥♥♥holes, them Space Marines are. But somehow, Relic has, once again, created a sort of relate-able glorified♥♥♥♥♥hole who has a heart of light (Or so we may think, depending on how you take the game.), and is a good character for the 40,000 universe. Upon arriving to the first Guardsmen outpost, he tells the lead Guardsman there that they saved themselves, and told him to rise. Captain Titus seems to treat Guardsmen as a form of little brother. It's very amusing to me.And oh my Emperor, the music. The music is very much, to me, the highlight of Space Marine. It's an absolute blast to listen to, and every second of it sends chills down my spine. It's like listening to Dawn of War II's ""The Green Horde Rises"" in 19 songs, ESPECIALLY ""A Hero's Legacy"". Holy crap (That plays during the end video, before the credits).Over all? I'd recommend getting it while on sale, but get it. It may not be your cup of tea, but try the Demo out. The two levels included (Well, level and a half because of the SHEER size of the Jump pack mission in game) are essentially copied and pasted out of the game itself. They give you a basic understanding of how the game works, and plenty of ways to test your skill.			",242,19,3,14,4,1,24

												Chainswords, Space British, and Orks with a K. Those are a few things to expect when playing 40k Space Marine. You play as Titus captain of the Ultramarines, and wow your whole team just look so badass. You have giant shoulder pads with skulls on them, you rip guys apart to get health back, you don't use cover because ♥♥♥♥ that and your dude just looks even cooler by the end of the game. The game starts off with you flying over this planet getting ready to land. When you spot Ork airships flying by. Then Captain Titus (you) makes the call and says were jumping, so that we can take out those airships. You do and you blow them up and of course you get separated form your squad. You then go out to find them and last survivors. The story defiantly takes a turn that I didn't really see coming, and it was a good one it changes up the story and the gameplay. For the most part of the game it just has you ripping through guy and tearing them apart weather it be with your Chainsword or with your guns, and it feels like they have mastered ripping guys apart because they just blow up in to the mist of red when you shoot them our when you gut them in half with your sword.  Just going into a group of 100 Orks and just coming out the other end covered in blood feels amazing, looks so cool,and is so much fun.    The story mode will take you about 8 to 10 hours to beat if you play it on normal. It feeds you new stuff pretty frequently so it feels a little different now that you have this new gun or this new melee weapon, it never gets dull I'll just say that.Now on to the multiplayer, which has variety of different modes 2 competitive, deathmatch and a point capture mode, then it also has a horde mode with waves of enemies and different objectives. It is class based you have a melee, a stationary gunner guy, and just you all around gun guy. It plays pretty well and has the call of duty carrot on a stick aspect of unlocking stuff as you progress but not only do you unlock weapons and perks but you also unlock a bunch of cosmetic items through achievements and leveling up, which personally I spent a lot of time just dressing up both my dudes. One of the main issues I had with it was that in the beginning it felt like I was really at a disadvantage, because it was just getting killed instantly in some cases. That might turn some players off but stick with it you unlock a lot of cool stuff from new stuff like a jetpack to all the guns you had access to in the campaign.The game is a great package with a satisfying campaign, some great multiplayer fun. It's centrally not perfect though, there's not that many different weapons, it can get dull and feel like your just doing the same thing over and over again, but those points are few and far between.

												Space Marine's singleplayer campaign is a thoroughly generic third-person action game, but multiplayer is where this game really comes through. There's the standard slew of competitive modes (plus Dreadnought, which nobody ever plays) and co-op against waves of Orks in the exceptionally fun Exterminatus mode. The controls are cumbersome and take a bit of getting used to, and you'll need to put in the time to level up before you'll be competitive in multiplayer, which can be an annoyance to newcomers short on patience. However, if you like third-person shooters and are willing to put in some substantial time, Space Marine can be a very fun and rewarding multiplayer game.			",1354,349,42,84,95,8,80

												This game is another solid hit from Relic. They have mostly captured what I conceive a Space Marine to be, which is a ♥♥♥♥ing mega tank that can run around exploding everything with its hands, feet, guns, knives, swords, chainswords, powerswords, poweraxes, grenades, and mouth and a variety of body parts. Space Marines will mother♥♥♥♥ing KILL you and then eat your face to ascertain how much badonk your mom's butt has, using their flesh memory powers. The single player campaign has you as an Ultramarine who doesn't really strike me as a standard ultramarine, because he's kind of Khorny and that's just weird. However, you bulldoze your way through hordes of Orcs and later Daemons to the end, which is a visceral experience. The feedback is pretty good as you can tell how powerful this guy is. The story is a tried and true Good Guys get duped but overcome everything in the end type thing. THe multiplayer is another animal entirely, you play as either a Space Marine or Chaos Space Marine in several modes which are all fun. The best part is unlocking new armor pieces to customize your Space Explosion Dude so he can look like whatever mary-sue chapter you want. The worst part is the matchmaking which isn't region locked, so you may very well end up getting teamed up with some dude from Tokyo who is hosting the match and you get terrible lag. Also some of the weapon augments give a slightly unfair advantage and they all take some sort of skill in order to unlock. My biggest complaint is that hardly anyone is playing anymore and that SUCKS A♥♥♥♥♥♥ Please play this game, I'd like to try out the DLC I purchased that I can't play since no one that plays has it or just doesn't start matches in it. You can be a ♥♥♥♥ing DREADNOUGHT that crushes and splatters dudes. Come in a be a SPAES MAHRENFinal score 15 billion out of 10*2			",136,16,0,32,7,0,15

												I really like this game, but then, I am a 40K fanboy. The game is a linear, point to point slaughter fest. A lot of the negative reviews mention it is repetitive it is. Then again so is every shooter in recent years. What the game does have is faithful to the lore art and information, great sound effects and a combat system that seamlessly switches between ranged combat and melee. The combat is visceral and very satisfying.  Despite being nearly four years old the engine has aged well.It is, I find amusing, that some reviews talk about the story being basic when the vast majority of games available are even worse and titles with grander production values fair worse. This game isn't Deus Ex and nor is it Wolfenstein Old Blood, i,e the only two shooters I can remember that have a good campaign.  It is satisfying, fit for purpose and gives you an excuse to kill lots of things. There are a number of enemy unit types in the game and most of the core Ork units are there, boyz, nobz, weirdboyz, gretchin, ard boyz and the warboss. Chaos units are fairly limited to psyers, cultist, tactical and devestator marines, champions and Khorne bloodletters. The campaign is the usual 7-8 hours odd depending on how much time you spend looking for things and difficulty you play on. This is pretty much standard to most Single Player games. The game is very well presented and polished. Negative reviews mention a number of issues, AI, geometry and scripting errors and I've yet to come across any issues, nada not one. One down side is the multiplayer which can be difficult to find games on, although it does have a large amount of customisation it could do with more variety. Even the horde mode is quite limited and perhaps should have went down the Dawn of War 2 route and allowed players to also play as Orks and Imperial Guard. I've gifted copies to friends and family to try and drag them into the game. Space Marine is game I will play again and again, it is the perfect game to just to unwind with, slaughter a few Orks and move on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine is one of those games that is absolutely perfect for unwinding after a hard day's work.  Co-worker's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off? Grab this massive chainsaw-sword and go chop up some Greenskins.Space Marine isn't a narrative masterpiece in the sense it has a rich story. While a lot of the storytelling is done through short bouts of exposition and sometimes in the middle of - you guessed it - tearing Orks to ribbons, Space Marine is none the less considered by me to be a stealth parody of not only the modern shooter franchise - what with its developers offing cover-based combat in the favour of charging headfirst into the enemy - but also a stealth parody of the playable Chapter in question - the ubiquitous Ultramarines Chapter, which has had a rather lengthy history of discontent by Space Marine players in Warhammer 40k.All in all, the Multiplayer and the Campaign aren't substantial, but they're definitely enough to satisfy you. 8/10, remember to play in short bouts, not every day, to keep the appeal running.

A literal badass, who's a unkillable juggernaut flying throughout the skies and slaughtering everything. Who wouldn't want to experience that?Everything about this game, is pretty damn great though not all games are perfect. There's flaws.._CONS_-There's no customization, all the DLC Content means nothing.-The enemies would yell ""Space Marine!"" a whole lot. I would basically be ♥♥♥♥ing rich by now from all the times I've heard that. That's about it for cons...Other than that, this game is glorious and a wonderful game to experience while you're blazed.

												The combat mechanic is satisfying as hell with an xbox 360 controller.   This is ultraviolence in its purest form, much like the original Veerhoven version of Robocop, it will stand for generations just for it's shocking brutality and impact.   This is the best purchase I've made in years and I love it.   Don't even care that it's linear, cos the combat is so good.   I cannot think of anything that would make this game any better.

												Fans of Warhammer 40k will absolutely not be disappointed, as this game has hours of Ork and Chaos slaughtering fun, with a careful attention paid to the game's lore (though nitpickers will note that the Ultramarine companies are an alternate version). Expect to see a number of beloved units and weapons from the Ultramarines, Chaos, Orks, and Imperial Guard. But you don't have to just be a Warhammer fan to appreciate it. Beautiful visuals, really visceral combat, and an exciting (and long) single player campaign make this game certainly one of the more fun third person shooters to come out. Similar to Gears of  War in playstyle, but definitely not a ""cover shooter"" -- cover is for cowards!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright so first off some context. Roughly one and half years ago my friend introduced me to warhammer. He told me about the ""Adeptus Astartes"" and the ""Imperium of Man"" and all that good stuff. I quickly fell in love with the universe. Since then i've built nearly two table top armies and read many books. Its probably my favorite Sci-Fy universe of all time. Sadly, there is a massive shortage of competent modern 40k games that really capture what we want from a 40k game. And thats romping about as a two ton super soldier blowing peoples heads of with diamond tipped explosive rounds in the name of the god emperor. This game sadly isint perfect, but its pretty close. Definatly reccommended for any 40k fan. Get some friends together and purge some xenos in the name of the emperor.

It's a bit like Gears of War, but still unique enough to be its own game. The combat is brutal and hectic and downright fun! I whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys 3rd person shooters or Warhammer 40k! Now if only we can get a Warhammer 40k MMO... or just more games in general...

The combat is intense and gratuitous, and the story and voice acting are everything you would want in a grand space opera, but it's the environment that I can't get enough of.

												Writing a simple review after my play through on Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine.Being new to the 40k universe, I enjoyed every moment i had in this game literally. -This game provides nonstop action, playing as Captain Titus. A literal badass, who's a unkillable juggernaut flying throughout the skies and slaughtering everything. Who wouldn't want to experience that?Everything about this game, is pretty damn great though not all games are perfect. There's flaws.._CONS_-There's no customization, all the DLC Content means nothing.-The enemies would yell ""Space Marine!"" a whole lot. I would basically be ♥♥♥♥ing rich by now from all the times I've heard that. That's about it for cons...Other than that, this game is glorious and a wonderful game to experience while you're blazed.

You will find yourself siting there staring at the crude markings found on special rocks that translate to ""0 Possible Games Found"" what could these mean ? a riddle that has pleagued the minds of many marines through the ages(do not buy this game it is terrible)			",139,13,0,9,5,3,3

												Pros:Visceral combat system with two popular PvP modes (capture point, team deathmatch) emphasizing teamplay. A blast to play with friends, if a bit anemic to play alone. Still active enough to have games running most of the time. Armor customization is detailed, even if the colors do not provide the large RGB spectrum like Dawn of War. But the amount of armor pieces, patterns and color combinations means that you will be hard pressed to create the same thing as another player unless you do it on purpose. Though not free of flaws, many of the early ones have long since been ironed out.Cons:A play-once campaign, with no supporting DLC to keep you going back, trains new players the wrong way for PvP. Anemic DLC adds very little to the game other than a small spattering of maps, unplayed modes, and an expensive lineup of unique armor that cannot be completely picked apart for custom outfits. P2P connectivity provides the constant, irritating spectre of lag and host switching. The graphics were already pushing middle-aged when it came out, but the animation and design made up for that. Nowadays, you'll either not mind or it'll drive you bonkers.The game's been out long enough that it has some fairly entrenched players that can be an overwhelming challenge to newcomers. And with obsessive veterans comes the abusive verbal treatment seen in many communities that have been destroyed by it.Other thoughts:People disagree on the weapon balance. I've used them all, and I think each one is fine, with distinct strengths and weaknesses. The exception being the axe, which is neither as fast as the sword nor as strong as the hammer, striking a balanced surpassed in utility by both alternatives.The community itself is hit-and-miss. While most of the players are amiable, there are a few grudge-bearing sour grape obsessives who will spend hours striving to verbally troll you out of an enjoyable evening. Like in most other online games. But since there isn't really any community control, simply block or don't respond.The game does have cheaters, but they are very rarely encountered. If it isn't something lag-borne like being shot through a wall, and is instead obvious like plasma cannon teleporting to high ledges to release charged shots, then teleporting back to safety, then you'll know for sure.And since this game now has defunct support, there is very little chance we'll see any more content for it, or even a sequel.My opinion's jumped around on this thing like a flea on hot coals. My initial overall landed on around six, but then it grew on me until I bumped it to seven, then finally eight at the peak of my interest. But as long as I keep playing, it's subject to change. Weighing the pros and cons together:7/10I've played for 1,200 hours. Of course I recommend it, with the understanding that the cons are taken into consideration before purchasing.

												A solid interpretation of what its like to be a space marine. Murder your way through hordes of orcs with both ranged and melee weapons as you try to stop an invasion. The orcs are trying to capture one of the Imperiums manufacturing worlds where the mighty battle titans are created and only Captain Titus and his Ultramarines can stem the tide until help arrives. The action is gory and brutal and with solid mouse and keyboard controls its easy to switch between aiming with your arsenal of ranged weapons and wading into the fray with your chainsword. The story is actually quite good all up and I got a kick out of playing through it. Its a good action game but if you are a fan of the 40K universe and its lore, its very good.

The gameplay in this is overall fun and easy, with both the keyboard and controller-enabled settings being easy. The graphics and visuals of this game is what sucked me in most, the background, character design, motion of the attacks, just generally everything is gorgeous to look at. The difficulty of the game varies from Easy, Normal and Hard. The biggest pain in the game is trying to recover health from Stunning and Executing the enemies, and during this time the other enemies can hammer down on you and take away the health you just gained.

												It's a mix between Gears of War and Devil May Cry.  It looks and feels like Gears of War, but then feels like Devil May Cry as enemies barge in screaming at you by the hundreds, only to be splattered as quickly as they came with satisfying gun and melee mechanics, rather than stick yourself behind bits of wall and play whack-a-mole.  Regardless of the aforementioned foes being very much kill-able, the campaign still presents a challenge, and while it is indeed only a 7 hour one, it's still fun, even for those who never touched the Warhammer lore in his life like myself.  The multiplayer, while a touch frustrating at first with spam and a leveling system that withholds equipment, quickly becomes addicting with well balanced, variable combat, and best of all, it's very easy to kill campers.  I heard that in October 2011, Steam users will get a free co-op campaign mode, but at the time of writing this, there is no co-op.  Still, a fun and very well optimized experience well worth it.

												Space Marines are the best thing ever to come out of tabletop games, the insanely over-zealous boistering, the overly elaborate and bulky armor and the sheer ridiculousness of the grim dark future setting are all to be loved greatly. Aside from the setting and characters which are always very good, the gameplay is everything what you would expect from combat with dudes 3 metres tall and weighing at least a tonn. It's clunky, bulky, slow and yet a very, very fast paced game. Combat rolling adds great mobility, jetpacks create great mindgame set-ups and because of it's third-person nature you can essentialy spy around corners without getting seen. A great game that's utterly silly and knows so.If i would rate this it would probably score a 5,860 on the GARthulian-scale.(which is almost as much as riding a flaming crocodile on a tsunami of dead dictators while eating a spicy rib-eye).

												Pros:Visceral combat system with two popular PvP modes (capture point, team deathmatch) emphasizing teamplay. A blast to play with friends, if a bit anemic to play alone. Still active enough to have games running most of the time. Armor customization is detailed, even if the colors do not provide the large RGB spectrum like Dawn of War. But the amount of armor pieces, patterns and color combinations means that you will be hard pressed to create the same thing as another player unless you do it on purpose. Though not free of flaws, many of the early ones have long since been ironed out.Cons:A play-once campaign, with no supporting DLC to keep you going back, trains new players the wrong way for PvP. Anemic DLC adds very little to the game other than a small spattering of maps, unplayed modes, and an expensive lineup of unique armor that cannot be completely picked apart for custom outfits. P2P connectivity provides the constant, irritating spectre of lag and host switching. The graphics were already pushing middle-aged when it came out, but the animation and design made up for that. Nowadays, you'll either not mind or it'll drive you bonkers.The game's been out long enough that it has some fairly entrenched players that can be an overwhelming challenge to newcomers. And with obsessive veterans comes the abusive verbal treatment seen in many communities that have been destroyed by it.Other thoughts:People disagree on the weapon balance. I've used them all, and I think each one is fine, with distinct strengths and weaknesses. The exception being the axe, which is neither as fast as the sword nor as strong as the hammer, striking a balanced surpassed in utility by both alternatives.The community itself is hit-and-miss. While most of the players are amiable, there are a few grudge-bearing sour grape obsessives who will spend hours striving to verbally troll you out of an enjoyable evening. Like in most other online games. But since there isn't really any community control, simply block or don't respond.The game does have cheaters, but they are very rarely encountered. If it isn't something lag-borne like being shot through a wall, and is instead obvious like plasma cannon teleporting to high ledges to release charged shots, then teleporting back to safety, then you'll know for sure.And since this game now has defunct support, there is very little chance we'll see any more content for it, or even a sequel.My opinion's jumped around on this thing like a flea on hot coals. My initial overall landed on around six, but then it grew on me until I bumped it to seven, then finally eight at the peak of my interest. But as long as I keep playing, it's subject to change. Weighing the pros and cons together:7/10I've played for 1,200 hours. Of course I recommend it, with the understanding that the cons are taken into consideration before purchasing.

												I realize I've not had much hours in this game. -Yet-. I plan on extending this number. Honestly in my opinion, this game is everything and more I could of expected out of a 3rd Person Shooter of the Warhammer series, and while it's multiplayer may get a bit frustrating from high levels, it quickly gets much easier and much more fun as you progress along and continue upgrading yourself and your equipment, the story line is rather interesting and definately poses a challenge. 10/10 in my personal opinion.

												Space Marines are the best thing ever to come out of tabletop games, the insanely over-zealous boistering, the overly elaborate and bulky armor and the sheer ridiculousness of the grim dark future setting are all to be loved greatly. Aside from the setting and characters which are always very good, the gameplay is everything what you would expect from combat with dudes 3 metres tall and weighing at least a tonn. It's clunky, bulky, slow and yet a very, very fast paced game. Combat rolling adds great mobility, jetpacks create great mindgame set-ups and because of it's third-person nature you can essentialy spy around corners without getting seen. A great game that's utterly silly and knows so.If i would rate this it would probably score a 5,860 on the GARthulian-scale.(which is almost as much as riding a flaming crocodile on a tsunami of dead dictators while eating a spicy rib-eye).

												This game is perfect for anyone who's into AWESOME games. The story and lore is MAJESTIC. Everything is connected and explained thoroughly (if you try enough to explore;). I LOVE it! Especially multyplayer. You have co-op and versus. I mostly play co-op because its a good starting point for newbs like me😜. You can choose between 3 different classes;TACTICAL: Wanna have it all? Well, here you go! Armour, plethora of guns and mobility.ASSAULT: Mobility and destruction dont even begin to explain this beast! A jetpack and a HUGE melee weapon to ♥♥♥♥ up anyones day. Oh and did i mention that every time you fly up, you can slam to the ground with all your weight and weapon wherever you aim? Well you CAN! Imagine a giant warhammer slamming your face, which is followed by a several ton heavy soldier of the Empire!And last but sure as hell not least,DEVESTATOR!Do you want to, just annihillate EVERYTHING and EVERYONE!?The heaviest soldier in the game (aside from terminator armor) wielding the heaviest possible guns while being able to dig in and double the fire rate of those weapons has by my standards one of the most OP melee attacks. He stomps his leg SO HARD, that everyone and everything around him goes flying away!Feel the power of absorbing every hit and sending back twice as much!If ASSAULT is concidered a ""glass cannon"" concidering his damage/armor ratio, than DEVESTATOR is a ♥♥♥♥ing BIG BERTHA! All in all, WHY DUH FAHK DIDNT YOU BUY IT YET?!?!			",86,3,0,10,4,0,15

												Came for a senseless stress reliever, stayed for a great story and actually still functional multiplayer!Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine turned out to be a fantastic game! I wasn't expecting much but it turns out I love it!I'm a fan of the Warhammer universe, and maybe that gives me a bias as to why I enjoy the game, but compared to other modern third person shooters Space Marine stands strong. I was even able to jump into a packed multiplayer lobby on the weekend!I did however foretell the ""plot twist"" in the game, but that is probably just because of my lore knowledge.Overall, and for what it's worth, I'd give Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine a 10/10, waiting on a follow up!For the Emperor!!

												I really loved this game, lots of fun, no wimpy cover mechanics, (so inb4 GOW clone - Astartes don't hide). shame the dev went and died, bigger shame is the community now is quite small and the matchmaking is distance agnostic. It's no fun trying to pvp on 500ms when the host is literally on the other side of the planet. If you're going to dip in and grab it, make sure you have some mates who will run with you so you can get a local host, there are plenty of steam groups still playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I didn't know what to expect since I didn't really follow this game and by the pictures I did imagine more of a Gears of War gameplay, but what I actually got was something closer to Darksiders without RPG elements.  The single player game took me about 5.5 hours in this Hack/Slash shooter.  The melee combat was really fun and I enjoyed all the guns as it was really fun killing the orks.  I would have to say that the game was a bit on th easy side or perhaps I should play it on hard mode.The game has a fair amount off comedy, emotion, and grit, but none off them are exceptional.  I really enjoyed kickin butt and mixing up melee combat with shooting. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves straight up action games without the need to learn complex ideas/controls.  I'd play it again if I didn't have so many games to play.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												The complete first person W40K Space Marine experience. Ten Ton Boot Stompin' Bolter shmorgasborg is pretty close. Single player campaign combines the dark, dreadly feel you'd expect (if you air-dropped into a Imperial Manufactorum overrun by Orks... and something even more deadly) with surprisingly satisfying and easily mastered combat styles. Those of you familiar with the GoW series will feel completely at home with the visceral execution system of regaining health, while the ability to customize your methods of dealing Death to the Heretics and Xeno Scum by picking weapons that excel in whatever medium you prefer combined with the effortless switch between ranged and close combat equals getting yelled at by my wife at 3:33 AM for screaming "" FOR THE EMPEROR!!!!!"".The online multiplayer is quite difficult but amazingly rewarding. Co op multiplayer is supposedly coming soon.			",209,8,0,31,5,0,36

												Fun, rather old school game, set in the WH40K universe. What I like:- Great gunplay..the weapons have nice sounds, both ranged and melee weapons.  Melee weapon combat has a well executed sense of weight and when you hit an enemy hard, there's a brief slo-mo to add more sense of ludicrous force. The Chainsword's roars and the eventual rough flesh tearing sounds never get less awesome either for example.-Blood and gore..there are nice execution animations for stunned enemies and the blood splash and dismemberment are well made, though there's not many dismembernent variations.-Fluid, brutal and just damn intense combat. No cover shooter stuff. Mostly you fight hordes and I wouldn't have it any other way. You can smoothly switch between melee and ranged combat.No regenerating health ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! You have a Halo style infinitely regenerating shield, but health is static and there isn't medikits or the like to heal you..you must stun an enemy and perform an execution, it will restore either about 33% of total health or even about 60% depending on executed enemy's type.Overall great sound design. Explosions, the Orks' trademark WAAGH and whatnot.What I rather don't like:Simplistic plot, not saying though it even needs to be complex.Only 3 factions in the game..could have been lots of extra awesomeness potential if more factions were in the story.In conclusion a fun 3rd person shooter with intense combat, the plot is not to be minded, the sheer catharsis of the combat makes up for it.

You get that feeling of grim dread as you are being overwhelmed in every field of battle. The odd are against you but you are adeptus astartes. Even if you have no idea what 40k is about this game is sure to drag you in with story driven intesity. The online play is just as fast paced and exciting as loyal chapters are pitted against the traitor legions useing every weapon of battlefield purging a space marine would ever need.

												Gears of Warhammer is great!Patch in a curb stomp and finish this bad boy.Seriously speaking -Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a game which sits in a heap of awesome lore. You Commander Titus of the Space Marines (Ultramarines Chapter) are the only hope of stopping an ork invasion over a man made Forge World. The purpose of this planet sized workshop is to produce the machinery for the Holy Emperor to fight in the countless wars the Warhammer 40k universe hosts. As the most useful option by calculation Titus and his men are called to the duty. They bravely jump strait into battle to stop the Orks from abusing a so called Titan, a massive war machine of great powers!Do you have what it takes to be the Commander of the Ultramarines? One of the most feared and iconic figures in the Warhammer 40k universe they have become the most honorued by all Space Marine Chapters in the whole Imperium of Man.As they say with holy speech:We are the Ultramarines, the sons of Guilliman.Whilst we draw breath, we stand. Whilst we fight, we prevail.Nothing shall stay our wrath.I fully recommend this game, thanks for reading.			",283,48,9,32,29,1,26

												The game is War. Its Brutal, addictive and all of what Warhammer should be. And fighting as a single space marine/chaos marine in a skirmish between sides definitely makes the cut when making it really feel like a warhammer game.The single player is fun, but really not all that I expected. Its the Multiplayer that really shines.But.. *Disclaimer*, its become more and more difficult to get into a Multiplayer match since the original launch of the game for obvious reasons, and with Peer to Peer (Why are games still doing this?) hosting, you usually end up on some hosted game that is just lagged all to hell and back. And with there being a limited community now, most people are max level with all the perks that give them the edge, so new player just tend to get wrecked until they get up in level a bit.I recommend the game because it was a great game, and still is. But with the multiplayer community dwindling, its more of a game to play for its single player or to play with friends who have the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Going to be short and simple here:Space Marine is a game that I felt was decent enough, the single player plays well and is challenging enough without being too hard, the story itself could of been a tad bit better but appears better than other games. What starts becoming a problem is that the multiplayer still needs some work, espcially with the hosting. Besides that what now discourages me from this game is the people. It is filled with clans, guilds, groups, etc. that mostly consist of stupid rascists that have nothing better to do but say♥♥♥♥♥♥and hate (Russians or ""Commies"" in particular). There are also those who may go around using a Melta gun for example and it just feels like my days in the Gears of War multiplayer but I learn to deal with something like that. So in conclusion I say this is a decent enough game but the multiplayer probably won't be as fun with the bad hosting and rascist dumbasses that plague it.			",135,12,0,9,17,0,41

A Sci-fi fantasy lovers Dreams  TL;DR Warhammer 40k: Space Marine is a very violent, loud and satisfying Warhammer game. The guns are all super fun to use and sound like hand cannons. The story is the usual affair with Warhammer games where orcs are running amuck but the chaos space marines are the real enemy, its never been the most complex or very interesting story, the gameplay is the main factor which can be a little repetitive but very entertaining for the first while. The multiplayer is also quite fun with multiple game modes and fighting styles to use. It’s also a pretty accurate game to the Warhammer universe.Follow us here Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipPros  Fun & loud weaponsAccurate to Warhammer universeFun combatJump packs Cons Mediocre storyRepetitive gameplay eventually---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GameplayThe Gameplay in Space Marine is the best part of the game for sure with loud and badass guns everything has explosive shots and make enemies just pop. Throughout the game, you will be given a variety of weapons to switch out and all of them are satisfying to play with either using a giant hammer your regular chainsword or a jump pack is super fun to play with. The problem is once your about half way through the game it get repetitive as you will tend to stick with certain weapons and you’ll be fighting hordes of the same enemy, it will start to feel more like a wave based shooter than an action game. StoryThe story pretty predictable with an odd twist at the end that I wasn’t sure that I liked. The rest of the game it’s just the regular Warhammer jargon of orcs are bad let’s go stop there waaaagh and oh the chaos are here doing demon stuff let’s stop them now. It’s a basic Warhammer game story but it’s still nice to hear and fits nicely. Characters The characters are forgettable as they essentially all warriors conversations are like listening too two slabs of concrete talk, they do stick to their race stereotypes orcs sounds like lobotomized Scotsmen , chaos all sound like angry and overconfident warriors and space marines sound like slabs of concrete.  Art/Graphics The game looks great and all the models look like what your imagine, bulky space marines cant jump or run really fast and the orcs are of varying sizes and easy to distinguish.  Everything in the game looks like actual Warhammer models. The sound design is great as well you are submersed in an actual waaagh and have to be cautious at all moments throughout the game.Bonus Notes If you like this join us here to get the latest Reviews:Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipWhat would you like to see for our next review ?

												This fantastic hack, slash, and shooter is a gloriously deep and rich dive into the life of a Space Marine during an Ork invasion of a forge world (see: civilians).  The single-player story will please both 40K fans and those new to the IP.  The multiplayer (co-op and vs) has depth, variety, and is still active three years later.  Easily worth any sale price.

												Campaign was fun and captured the spirit of the 40k setting, while multiplayer was a glorious experience.

The ride it took me on was like no other game and the fact i was a mighty space marine, smashing down ork and chaos alike, brought joy to my heart.

												The multiplayer's full of griefers and hackers and is generally unpleasant. But who cares when the Single Player Campaign and the Co-Op mode is soooooooooooooo GOOD ! Great story, great action, The violence is completely over done and over the top. Even the method in which you heal yourself is beyond brutal. Most definitely one the most under-rated games of the last generation. A fantastic Third Person Shooter and a personal favourite with solid mechanics, awesome guns that both perform and sound great (seriously, I can't think of any other game where the weapon sound is as awesome as this. Even your standard side arm gives new, fresh insight into the term ""hand cannon""). Giving you all the help you'll need to face down the onslaught of an Ork Waaagh !In the MP / Co-Op the customisation options are numerous and many, As well as being able to choose straight paint jobs from Space Marine chapters of the 40K universe. The Multiplayer itself, instead of being a tactical ground shooter as it probably should be. Just turns out to be half a dozen or so game modes. Where any advance you wish to make is usually thwarted by hammer wielding Space Ninjas. Something which I have never really found a decent footing with. The MP does serves somewhat of a purpose though. As it is the only mode in which you can unlock extra perks and special bits of armour. Though you rely on these extras in the Co-Op, Exterminatus mode. The Multiplayer is the only place where you can obtain them for use. Which is a bit inconvenient and bad planning on Relics part. Multiplayer tends to be pretty much dead. And when it's not. The games are usually squalid affairs, mad rushes of chaotic nonsense in which team communication is non-existant. Running a gauntlet of God Mode kids and aimbots. The major downside of all this is, if you want those weapon perks, then you'll need some good friends to MP with. Either that or go about it in the boring way and do a bit of ""Perk farming"". Although nice to have. The Weapon Perks themselves don't really add all that much in the Co-Op. It's all really down to how you utilise your loadout and what you're comfortable with using. It certainly won't make things any easier. As the Exterminatus has to be one of the toughest Co-Op game modes out there. No matter how experienced you get. Victory is never a sure fire thing and these three sets (one as DLC), of four horde arenas are an absolute nightmare. Relic really wanted to make you feel that you survive it rather than ""Kick its @$$"". And provides you a hellish slice of button bashing, trigger pulling warfare. That puts your tiny four marine team into a green-meatgrinder for 21 Waves of unfettered violence.Some might say that the Single Player campaign is a little on the short side, rolling in at around 8 to 10 hours. But that just means that it doesn't out stay its welcome anytime. Keeping the story snappy and to the point, but leaving plenty of room for wanting more (hint, hint SEGA/Relic). And if you can't already tell from the Store Page Vids and Screenies, the graphics and animations are more than competant. Can't praise this enough.Bloody, BLOODY brilliant....And any chump who says different is a heretic of chaos and should be tossed into the WARP to rot along with their squalid collection of girls games !FOR THE EMPEROR 10 / 10***WARNING*** Win 10 users will regularly need to check cache integrity of the game after each time your OS updates. Because, MICROSOFT ""/. Don't be dissuaded ! It would just be a shame if you allowed a little technical hitch to keep you from purchasing this wonderful title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you enjoy a nice neon-paletted future where corporations rule and humanity is kept down by an oppressive government? Well then you'll like this, provided you don't want the neon palette. This is the vision of a future where humanity is past its' prime and is trying to fend off the slow decay of time; all while fending off hordes of aliens and daemons. The grimness of this universe is a refreshing twist, even after several decades as a series.Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine puts you in the boots and bulky armour of one of the Imperiums' chapters of Space Marines. If you like sitting behind a wall and occasionally firing over the wall, then just stop there. In this game, there ARE no walls (metaphorically speaking of course)! YOU are the wall. You are a shield for the weak and a sword to be swung by the powers that be. As much as the game preaches that life is the Emperors' currency; you are a sturdy block of gold, in a world populated by pennies and pound coins. So what makes you so valuable, apart from the shiny aspect of your nature?You are a block of Gold. Let's do a comparison. I want you to drop a penny onto your fingers while they are on a desk. Didn't hurt, did it? Now; drop a big block of Gold. If you actually did, I applaud your delusion of invulnerability, but I'm not going to kiss your boo-boo better. If you didn't; you're smarter than the person asking me to kiss the boo-boo. You see, logical thought dictates that there is a big difference in the damage a penny and a Gold Brick can do. You play the heavier of the two objects; that most delightful bringer of death. You are a big stompy thundering cannon comprised of flesh and muscle, located securely behind an energy shield and a hell of alot of metal. You don't fire a little 9mm pistol as you do in so many other titles. With your bulkier stature, you should be able to wield more mighty weapons and this game will allow you. Ever wondered what happens when a rocket propelled explosive shell (with a diameter of nearly an inch) comes into contact with the face of a 6 foot Ork, armed with naught but a club and a suicidal disregard for the laws of physics and mortality? If you answered ""red?"" then the klaxons in your room, set to ring with the sounds of victory when you are correct (at least if you're as egocentric as I) should be deafening you in reward for your foresight.In a world full of games with lots of brown or orange; this game decides that red is still a viable colour. VERY viable. In fact, so viable that often times you will encounter pools of red where once a green enemy stood. If you are discouraged by blood, this game isn't for you. If you like blood, this game delivers it in such vast amounts that even the least sadomasochistic of us would still require the unbuttoning of the jeans to alleviate the tightness the combat produces. While I recommend this game to women as well, this game has an undeniable reek of man about it. I would be surprised if the word ""testosterone"" was not included once in every five lines of code written for the engine. While there is a brilliant plot behind the title, it isn't one that I'd recommend you buy the game for. The plot isn't what you want in a game, is it? Plot is a nice addition but gameplay is what differentiates a game from a movie or book and this is a shining example of that ideology. You fire rocket propelled shells from a fully automatic death-cannon; when you aren't lobbing balls of corrosive plasma into the faces of a tiny little green fellow. But range is only a part of the game. To regenerate health, you are not allowed to cower. Your health is tied to your efficiency in combat, as it drops when your shield is depleted and raises when you execute an enemy in close combat. To replenish your red goo, you need to turn your foes into red goo, and presumably the splat perks your character up enough to make him healthy again. Still makes more sense than being eaten by a dog in an open world game and healing up by pulling a bullet out of your left arm. It sounds better too. There is a definite booming sound behind your guns and your mighty melee weapons sound vastly different when they smash into metal in comparison to tearing through flesh. Your chainsword revs pleasurably as you swing it and your heavy bolters sound exactly as the name makes you believe. They sound heavy, as if they were firing bolts. Now let us discuss multiplayer. Six big stompy fellows clash against six big stompy fellows and there are three types of big stompy fellow you can be. You can be a tactical marine, who lumbers across the battlefield with some medium power ranged weapons. The assault marines jet around the battlefield with jump packs, slamming with a mighty force into the ground before spinning their melee weapons viciously to rend the flesh of all who oppose them. If you are more of a heavy fellow, the Devastators will fit you perfectly. Armed with the biggest weapons of all three, they stomp and wield death at range. They are so heavily equipped that instead of shoulder charging an enemy to interrupt the swing of their sword; they kick them. Even as you walk, the camera shakes to give you the true sense that you are heavy, gifted the power of a ton of metal and muscle. The ground never seems to sit still when you introduce twelve armoured Goliaths upon a map.This is a game of David versus Goliath; except this time, you play Goliath and logic wins over storybook morality. Big stompy fellows don't get stopped by a stone, they club the sling wielder into the ground with fist and foot.			",830,199,24,105,88,8,144

												This had been languishing in my backlog as a pickup from a Summer sale 4 years ago.  It's too bad it just now caught my eye as it really is a gem.  The combat has it's quirk, but is generally tight and responsive.  It was billed at the time as the ""anti-Gears of War"" - it's a 3rd person shooter but not intended to require abuse of cover mechanics.  Unfortunately, the last quarter of that game punishes the player for playing it that way; ditching melee and focusing on ranged firepower is the only way I was able to beat  this very difficult part of the game.This is also nice in short clipping in at 8 hours, so it doesn't overstay it's welcome.  If you like W40K, or 3rd person action games, you can't go wrong picking this one up.  Recommended.			",75,14,0,9,2,0,3

Many things can lead to heresey, one of them being idleness and the list of others is as follows: not reading the astartes codex every day, not reading the astartes codex to your children before bed, worshiping anything other than the Emperor, camping in FPS games, eating pizza with a fork and knife, supporting pop music, carrying a weapon with a caliber less than that of a bolt gun, using a chainsaw for cutting down trees as opposed to heretics, eating tofu (dont be a ♥♥♥♥♥, you have canine teeth eat meet you ♥♥♥♥ing hipster), and basically any other heretical behavior.

												I don't really know anything about Warhammer, so I can't comment on whether or not Space Marine is faithful to the source material. What I can say is that Space Marine is a good game, and I enjoyed playing it. Even though its a few years old, it still compares favourably to newer games in some ways.Gameplay is really fun. Its a fast paced third person shooter where you're constantly fighting dozens of enemies at a time. There's a decent mix of short and long range weapons, and a few different enemy types. In some sections you fight alongside two other space marines, and their AI is surprisingly helpful. I tended to hang back and use the two variations of sniper rifle, and my allies actually did a good job of keeping melee enemies out of my face.After about an hour you unlock a ""fury"" meter, which is filled by damaging enemies, and when activated will increase your damage output while regenerating your health, which is really useful in tough fights. There are also a couple of sections where you get a jetpack and a massive, powerful warhammer, which allows you to jump high in the air to avoid enemies, then smash down on them for an AOE attack that will either kill or stun a group of enemies.Level design is entirely linear, and this means the game is also quite short. I finished it in just under 6.5 hours, on normal difficulty. It would have benefited from having a few side paths containing optional objectives.The story is okay, but fairly basic. The Orcs are attacking a Human world, and Captain Titus of the Ultramarines (that's you) is trying to stop them. It gets a bit more interesting about halfway through when something happens that I don't want to spoil. But it never really gets any deeper than ""the enemy is over there, go shoot them"". However, it does have a fun, ridiculous, over the top but not too serious atmosphere. And it really feels like you're caught up in the middle of a massive war, with other battles in progress around you.As a player who is new to the Warhammer universe, I would have liked a bit more detail so I could properly understand the story. There's lots of jargon, technical terms and faction names such as ""codex astartes"", ""inquisitor"" and ""psyker"" and it seems like the developers just assume that the player is already familiar with the lore. (One of the reasons that I decided to play this game is that there seems to be alot of Warhammer games coming out these days, so I want to try to learn what its all about).The voice acting is pretty good, and features an experienced TV/film actor Mark Strong as Captain Titus. Controls are fully rebindable and I didn't encounter any bugs.I definitely recommend picking up Warhammer 40K Space Marine, and you should be able to grab it on a 75% off deal during one of Steam's many sales.

												Well, the campaign is nice. Everything works fine there.I played it on the Xbox 360 when it first came out, and it was okay. But now, with it being so old, I haven't been able to find any multiplayer matches that have any kind of quality connection. The game was great back then, but now...the campaign is only interesting so many times, and lagging through half of a match isn't what I enjoy.Most of the multiplayer unlocks, equipment and armor, is only unlockable in Versus mode. I wasn't able to find a match. Exterminatus is four players versus waves of orks and stuff, and that has a few minutes on the que time. It also doesn't unlock any new equipment for you to be able to use.I can't recommend this game unless you already have people to play it with. Finding any sort of multiplayer match is not worth waiting more then fifteen minutes and still be waiting. If you're a fan of Warhammer 40k, and want to see the story, then the campaign is there. I got it on sale, so it's not a big waste of money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												chaos space marines. Chosen of  nemoraoth. This is my favorite warhammer 40k game next to the DOW series. With an amazing story line and single player campign that ties in all Warhammer 40k fluff and fan fiction to be a perfect blend of getting lost in the Warhammer 40k universe and  you enjoy it. Thoroughly.  The bad guy is actually a bad guy, ( wasnt all talk, actually killed and ruled and made promise his threats...) the story makes sence and there is skill, tactics and RPG elements in it to make it just enough addicting. Nothing overwelming or crazy to understand. I was such a huge fan of the chaos space marines and there leader Chaos Lord Nemoroth that I made up and painted the army for my Warhammer 40k tabletop games. Its nerdy  and im a Warhammer 40k fanboy, I get that, but this game delivers even for the non Warhammer 40k fans. It was a solid shooter and campagin with acheivments and trials to put any gamer to test.  This game really deliverd what we havnt seen before and it really broke the mold of what they can do with the Warhammer 40k games and universe with upcoming graphics and tech.  It still can stand up as one of the best Warhammer 40k games out there even with the new and upcoming games. It was that well done.			",77,12,0,17,2,0,18

												Relic have really captured the feel of the 40k universe here and to take on a project as big as this given the fan base from the table top game they have done an outstanding job. Campaign storyline is involving, and gameplay is excellent with the camera moving well during melee combat and a wide selection of ranged weaponary, and a good spread of foe types, mission objectives are varied and challenging. Multiplayer is equal in it's enjoyment offering already three different game types with more and works very well in all, and the option to totally customise your characters armour and weapon loadouts keeps it interesting. It's too bad that the Orkish walkers Killa Kans were not in the main game dispite being featured in the trailers and screenshots. Still this was Relic's last Warhammer game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												fairly low-spec. i can run this on my laptop with no problem. the later levels could start to get a little frustrating if you picked up the ""charge in the enemies' face and hack away with your chansword/poweraxe/power hammer"" style of play. when I started fighting chaos space marines, they deal so much damage so quickly i had to hide behind cover and game the shooting mechanics to shoot enemies through cover. The story is pretty good, but there is no character development. There is you, the veteran dude that can use all the weapons. There is the old guy that's the grizzled grunt and the young 'un that wont shut up about the codex astartes as if it was penned and handed down to him by the God Emperor himself.Surprised to find multiplayer was not dead, Got into some co-op games, which worked pretty good. Killing Orks with friends could be really fun, if killing Orks with strangers is anything to go by. Haven't played any PVP yet, and not really feeling PVP in this game anyway.			",83,10,4,3,3,1,11

												In the darkness of the 41st Millennium, there is only war. And Aliens. And Daemons. And things that go BOOM!Yep, a day in the life of a Space Marine, involving close combat mechanics, dodging enemy fire and zapping/powing/kersplatting the alien hordes. The mele combat is nice and visceral, and the shooting mechanics are pretty solid to boot. Fun little game, marred only by repetition and lack of scope. By no means a bad game, its fun, but a little lengthy in places and sometimes has yopu crying out for something new along the journey. Still, if you are a Games Workshop afficionado, this is a very faithful game to the lore of 40K.An 8/10 for fans of the IP, 7/10 for everyone else. Good little game but needs a bit more oomph.

												An incredible action packed game.Multiplayer is where the heart is.  Whether it be Team Deathmatch or Horde mode, this game makes you FEEL powerful.  And it your own mistakes and ego that gets you in over your head.Compared to Gears of War quite alot.  Why complain if two games are similar?  If they are similar, then perhaps you should consider enjoying the similarities but in a different context.... a context of Warhammer which came BEFORE Gears of War. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say, it's just beautiful. Everything you could hope from a third person sci-fi. Brilliant detail, hordes of different enemies and you get to look awesome whilst you do it! The variation of different weapons you can have is great too and that goes for close combat as well. For a 40K fan this is perfect, the Adeptus Astartes have been modelled well and you can't find fault with the enemies either. The only mode is good too, being able to form a proper squad with great customisation and c'mon, who doesn't want to rip through a massive ork with a chain sword! 10/10!			",72,2,0,15,1,0,5

												WARHAMMER 40,000 SPACE MARINE is true to the deepest black hole core to the legendary gaming series created by Games Workshop and all its video game conversions bringing the non-stop violent nightmare reality to a excellently executed third person point of view.Grisly graphics, heart pounding tense audio effects, immersive voice acting, epic battle inspiring music, fun detailed game mechanics which are easy to get into yet have a surreal learning style to them such as using the very satisfying jump packs while trying to master manevouring while in flight all makes one feel like they are an actual Space Marine bringing the Emperors will to the enemies of mankind.Enemies are varied and downright scary at times especially with the creepy sound effects.Weapons and melee combat come with many easy to use combo moves which increase damage to a most brutally satisfying visual display. Truly gut wrenching euphoria.Once more RELIC has dared as they did with WARHAMMER 40k DAWN OF WAR 2 and once again they have shown with jaw dropping success to the fan masses change is a good thing.Here is hoping there will be many more chapters unfolding in the huge potential of SPACE MARINE. Praise the Emperor and purchase this violent strategic kill fest if killing Orcs and seeing little Gretchins run for their lives gets your blood going.Thank you RELIC for always making your fantastic creations worth the price of admission :) ",254,49,4,61,35,1,105

												By the time you're done with the first level, you will want to scream 'FOR THE EMPEROR!!' On paper, this seems like your standard third person shooter, there's bullets coming out of stuff, and there's regenerating shields, so all we need now is the cover, right?... What do you mean there's no cover function? What do you mean that what cover there is, is fully destructible? What do you mean shields are depleted easilly? What do you mean I won't be shooting at stuff most of the time? What do you mean I have to wade in there and execute stuff to regain my non-regenerating health?Welcome to Space Marine, where taking cover is HERESY, and where the best way of dealing with problems is to chop its head off or crush it with your BARE HANDS!In the grimdark future of Warhammer 40K, there is only war. And it is glorious, fun to play, and a relief from the mediocrity of other third-person shooters with cover.			",56,11,2,8,6,1,21

												It's an absolute shame that this game is effectively dead due to the producers going belly up - but if you've got a group of friends you can play this, it's an absolute gem of a game (thankfully weapon perks and armor pieces can be unlocked in private versus lobbies)The single-player campaign, while not a diamond of writing is still a lot of fun to go through for a ""classical"" space marine experience, regardless of my personal feelings for the Ultrasmurfs and the multiplayer, specifically the ""Exterminatus"" mode, is outrageous, pulse-pounding fun when you get a group of friends together in a skype call while you're playing it.If you can get the boys together for a few rounds, I heartily recommend it!

												This a 3D shooter in which your avatar (a 3 meter tall superhuman wrapped in baby blue battle armor)  wades through a broken, post-apocalyptic landscape, using a selection of unlikely, anachronistic  gadgets to dissolve hordes of near mindless enemies into piles of gore and clouds of splattered blood.  If that description alone is not enough to make your heart beat a little faster and your palms a little sweaty, you are probably browsing the wrong section of the Steam store.Seriously though, this is a game well worth buying (when it is on sale, anyway).  The gameplay is fairly solid.  The mechanics are entertaining.  And the single-player storyline is actually about as good as gets for a video game, let alone a 3D shooter.  In a genre filled with over-the-top action heroes, pseudo-military jargon spewers and gangster wannabees, Captain Titus, is a genuinely decent , believable hero-type.  Its a nice change of pace.  And the dialogue and voice acting for all the human characters is outstanding.  They really come to life.

												The metacritic rating for Space Marine is about right (74%), but I thoroughly enjoyed it because the developers painstakingly recreated the 40k universe. I don't think I know if another franchise-based game that feels quite as spot on. With that said, the gameplay does have a few issues. Combat borrows heavily from God of War, with the addition of a solid shooter component (sans cover mechanic, thankfully?); which is to say the combat has variety but lacks real depth. Multiplayer has serious ups and downs, due mostly to the lack of dedicated server support and MASSIVE lag issues if the host is not on your content (which happens about half of the time). The ""unlocks"" and leveling component offers a few gameplay options without breaking multiplayer. Also included is a co-op ""survival"" mode (up to 4 players), which only has a few maps but is a riot when you can pull together a few buds for a match. When Space Marine is on sale, it's a great buy for any Warhammer 40k fan.			",274,47,4,34,21,0,50

												This game is greatly underappreciated.  It perfectly matches the atmosphere of the Warhammer 40k universe.  The game takes place over a short period of time during which the action and importance of what is going on quickly escalates.  Playing as one of the Ultramarines provides a great look into the world of 40k by allowing the players to become a seemingly unstoppable weapon as you fight hordes of enemies.  The game does a great job of making the events feel significant, and by the end of the game I was completely invested in the story.  Sadly, no sequels will be made to follow up on Space Marine, but the game completes what is necessary for the players to guess as to what could happen next.  I would highly recommend this game to Warhammer 40k fans and gamers wanting to be a part of a gritty adventure.			",135,23,2,15,4,0,31

												This is a great game for Games Workshop, offering strong gameplay and a nice long campaign which covers a small selection of enemies to the Space Marines from the 40K Universe. Though the generic Ultramarine chapter has been designated for the SP campaign, the MP game allows for infinite chapter colours as well as some great DLC chapters. Acquiring all the achivements can take some doing as there are some very specific demands for a lot of them in order to gain bonuses, whereas levelling up to 41 is simply about playing for a long time. The MP co-op is pretty good fun, against the Orks, in a Left4Dead fashion you have to face wave after wave of hoardes of greenskins with a few specialist troops thrown to make things tough. There is also a Chaos version offering a variety of Chaos themed foes. The voice acting is good, gorefest is high, the AI can sometimes be quite tactical and tricky to overcome. There is a strange grenade launcher, original to the game and not a GW concept, it takes some getting used to, though to be fair the most fun comes from using bolters and the chainsword in melée. During MP get used to annoying players who spam metagun and plasma or lascannon attacks, as they are instant kill weapons which generally require less skill than the rest of the armoury. MP's biggest weakness is the lack of an open server list, you are thrown into the lobby of a match the game decides on and that's it.. shame, as this game could easily have attracted a bigger player base had it been more flexible with regards to offering hosting options.

This was my introduction after having friends nag me to play Dark Heresy with them for the past few months, and me always making hasty assumptions on the Warhammer 40K uni based on the stereotyping inherent in this game's very title that made me cringe. It doesn't help that I'm no fan of hack 'n' slash.As I continued to play, however, I found myself sucked back in again and again, thinking of this game in my off-hours, and suddenly the depth to the game's world and gameplay and the flat-looking characters started showing through, and gosh dang, I'm now seeing what keeps my hombres so enthralled in this self-consciously macho 'n' manly Warhammer business. These MFin' space marines are Zen, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it. It's a fun diversion, this game, and the story, while predictable, was pretty well-done and -paced--for the most part (the Ork waves did get a tad exhausting).			",728,235,9,105,37,7,84

												This game is seriously the most fun you can have with your pants on!If you want THE quintessential Warhammer 40K experience, this is it. It is brutal, alredanline pumping, blood soaked fun! The game follows a Command Squad of three of the Ultramarines (you play as 2nd Company Commander Titus), called in as reinforcements to the war torn Forge world of Graia. You are big, you are hulking and nothing stands in your way. You ARE a Space Marine and this game gets MASSIVE praise for making me feel like one!In terms of Gameplay, Space Marine plays a lot like the love child of 'Gears of War' and 'God of War' in relation to its shooting and melee mechanics. The controls are slick, the game looks fantastic and it was very fun to just pick up and play. This coupled with a FANTASTIC story ripped straight out of the 40K universe makes it a must have title.25 out of 10. Would absolutely reccommend!			",132,22,1,15,5,2,9

												When i first played the demo i was amazed. The combat system is fast, full of adrenaline, and the melee and ranged combat is just perfect together. It feels absolutely good to blow a head of an orc off or slice him in two. The weakest point in the game is the single player with an average story and weak boss fights, but the multiplayer is the best out there. Its quite balanced, very fast paced, and very unique. The exterminatus game mode offers you the joy of slaughtering hordes of enemies, and a hard challenge at the same time. Buy the game, get out there with a heavy bolter, shoot some orcs, and u will know what I was talkin about.			",120,49,1,20,14,0,39

												I fully admit to being a W40K geek, so finally getting to take control of a Space Marine is pretty much a fantasy fufilled. Relic are regularly known for their RTS but here they have switched to a 3PS and conquered it. The movement is smooth, the arena's are stunning, the game play is tough enough that it makes me curse now and then (always a sign of a good game), and so far I am really enjoying the storyline.

												Mindless violence I hear you say? Yes, it's actually completly mindless, take my word for it. Work reduced you to the level of a moronic automaton? Excellent! You are now ready to play Space Marine! I loves it! Did I mention that the mindless violence also sounds awesome and looks so beautiful it will make you cry? GET SOME! PS: In multiplayer mode it's simplicity itself to drop in and out of mates games with no fiddly port forwarding, smelly match making software or servers to configure.WIN / WIN :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The single player is alright.  Nice combat, a nice selection of weapons (although not nearly enough) and tons of dudes to kill make for an enjoyable experiance.  Still this game makes the cardal sin of gaming and makes the last boss battle a quick time event.  No one really plays multiplayer.			",690,166,20,105,63,13,133

												Now this is one of few 40k games that have the best: settings, story, gameplay and graphics. From the first to the last mission in campagin you will be butcher of Forge World Graia, the number of Orks that you will kill is beyond any reasonably number and it's feels so good. When you get really angry or you feel overrun , just use ""Fury"" mode and you're done with them. Now here you will feel too much overpowerd but again it feels so good. The game is fully in 3rd person view mod, you can only get in 1st person view mod if you aim with the scope. I must say that I like settings and visual graphics of the game. Everywhere you look you will get that feel of 40k battlefield, completely destroyed city full with bodies of fallen Imperial Guardmans, sad like every other 40k story. When you finished with killing Orks and Chaos legions in campaign you can launch CO-OP which has only one mod, a wave mod. Here you need to defend against 20 waves of Orks and Chaos. Today with lacking players for PvP multiplayer you will spend more time playing only CO-OP mode. When comes to Multiplayer and PvP gameplay, you will get problems. Problem number one, lack of players. Peek number of player daily is ~300 players. Problem number two, playing this game in 3rd person MP is not really interesing to play, you will die often and even when you kill other player, you will get that ""meh"" effect. It's just that MP game mode looks so simple and boring, very boring. Don't buy this game for MP !Pros:- Great visuals- Great 40k settings- Good story- Good gameplay- Plenty of Orks to kill- CO-OP mode- Space Marines are OverpowerdCons:- Multiplayer - Lack of people playing it- Multiplayer gameplay- Killing Orks gets little boringI highly recommend this game mainly and only for Campaign game play. CO-OP is also fun but it lacks maps. But If you want to play Multiplayer against other players, then you will be disappointed, people just don't play this game. As a 40k fan this is a must have game. Oh and don't buy it for a full price, try to buy it on the sale or something like that.We March for Macragge !!!			",35,0,0,6,2,0,8

												A new take in gaming in the W40K universe as you play Captain Titus of the Ultramarines in a unique third person shooter as you defend a forgeworld from the WAAARRGGHH. Equip yourself with the iconic weapons and gear of the unstoppable Space Marines and cleave and blast your way through the unrelenting hordes of Orks and the invading Chaos. It also has some enjoyable co-op horde mode play that pits you and your friends against waves of enemies in a fashion similar to last stand in DOW II Retribution. 10/10.			",243,24,7,26,22,4,40

												Warhammer40K. A game with a rich history and historic battles. This game let's you BE one of those Marines that you command on the ground. I've heard about the series for years. But I've never had a chance to experience the  Ultramarines until now. I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to simply destroy everything in your path in the most satisfying way possible. It's you against entire Hoards.  Gotta love those odds. That's where you call upon the will of the emperor and tear the scourge to shreds in holy fury.   This is a great start to get into the War Hammer40K series. I recommend it			",39,1,0,2,0,0,4

												In the darkness of the 41st Millennium, there is only war. And Aliens. And Daemons. And things that go BOOM!Yep, a day in the life of a Space Marine, involving close combat mechanics, dodging enemy fire and zapping/powing/kersplatting the alien hordes. The mele combat is nice and visceral, and the shooting mechanics are pretty solid to boot. Fun little game, marred only by repetition and lack of scope. By no means a bad game, its fun, but a little lengthy in places and sometimes has yopu crying out for something new along the journey. Still, if you are a Games Workshop afficionado, this is a very faithful game to the lore of 40K.An 8/10 for fans of the IP, 7/10 for everyone else. Good little game but needs a bit more oomph.

												fairly low-spec. i can run this on my laptop with no problem. the later levels could start to get a little frustrating if you picked up the ""charge in the enemies' face and hack away with your chansword/poweraxe/power hammer"" style of play. when I started fighting chaos space marines, they deal so much damage so quickly i had to hide behind cover and game the shooting mechanics to shoot enemies through cover. The story is pretty good, but there is no character development. There is you, the veteran dude that can use all the weapons. There is the old guy that's the grizzled grunt and the young 'un that wont shut up about the codex astartes as if it was penned and handed down to him by the God Emperor himself.Surprised to find multiplayer was not dead, Got into some co-op games, which worked pretty good. Killing Orks with friends could be really fun, if killing Orks with strangers is anything to go by. Haven't played any PVP yet, and not really feeling PVP in this game anyway.			",83,10,4,3,3,1,11

												Space Marine is a third-person shooter set within the Warhammer 40k Universe featuring a strike team of Space Marines from the Ultramarine Chapter intent of halting an Ork invasion of an Imperial world.The plot centres around Captain Titus and two squad mates who arrive in the midst of an Ork invasion of an Imperial Forge world with orders to slay the Ork Warlord and crush the invasion. As their mission goes on events unfold to reveal the Greenskin invasion is not the only hazard facing our Ultramarine protagonists.Definitely recommended for fans of the 40k Universe, the settings, characters, weapons, locations, events, set pieces are all very faithful to the source material and are enjoyable to see on screen. The game itself does get a tad repetitive after a while, similar enemies’ crop up again and again but ultimately enjoyable.			",321,46,0,26,27,3,65

												This game is alot of fun at full price but at 75% off it is a bargain. If you like Warhammer 40,000, or even action games in general, this one is great. Space Marine instantly switches between shooter and mellee combat so fluid that making a mess of  Orcs is not only highly addictive, but you can get creative too.Check out my first impressions video to see more on Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine:

												FOR THE EMPRAH! (inside joke) anyway, this game is FANTASTIC, for anyone liking action games with melee weapons being AMAZEBALLS (the feeling of power is definately there) You are a Space Marine, One of the God-Emperor's chosen supersoldiers, you fight for the survirval of the utterly corrupt and galaxy spanning Imperium of mankind. The backstory of this universe (40k) is huge, and i would suggest you check out the 40k lexicanum on the interwebs if you are interested, its one of my favourite sci-fi universes for the simple reason that is stated clearly by the usual intro.""In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war""While this is a action game in the universe, other games to reccomend are the strategy games by the name of Dawn of War 1 DoW: Dark crusade, and, if you want to deal with mods due to several broken races DoW: Soulstorm. There is also a sequel to this series which is Dawn of war 2, and expansions Chaos rising and Retribution.FOR THE EMPEROR! FOR TERRA! (sorry, 40k geek)			",157,23,2,69,43,0,96

												     This game is a grippin thrid person shooter that pulls you into a world rich with lore right from the start. From the very beginning you feel excited to be a Space Marine and can tell that there are politics going on around you that can only be guessed at. This really adds to the feel of the game. As far as enemies go the orcs can be repetitive and you can start to wonder when you will have a new enemy, but seeing as you are attacking the orc planet its hard to criticize too much on that. They do mix it up well with different orc bosses and increasingly massive and heavily armored or infantry though.     My favorite thing about this game is the mutiplayer. Its crazy addictive and levelling up is a blast in it. I recomend this game to anyone who enjoys a game through the eyes of a true Lawfully Good alligned protagonist who values righteousness and honor above all else, and to anyone who enjoys a glimpse at a vast world that you are directly thrust into.

The combat is brutal, violent, and rewards you for being aggressive. There are only a few parts of the game where you need to take a little more caution in face punching things.Multiplayer is underhwelming, but it is to be expected given its console focused development.Despite some pretty heavy flaws, its worth giving it a spin if you want a nice trompy space marine bulldoze the orcs experience.I can only hope, if somehow they manage to get a sequel to this thing, they avoid outsourcing the level design again.

												loved it, it's like a sort of gears take on a warhammer 40k game and for a 3rd person shooter it rocks.my only cons would be multiplayer is suffering due to lack of numbers and the occasional person runs an aim bot. but the aimbot is semi-remedied by the fact they usually run bolters or stalkers which don't always land a headshot.

												This is a fun game and really gets the idea of an Astartes being a walking war machine. It is a mix of shooting and melee, big swarms of enemies, bullets flying, blood spraying and lots of noise !. Pros:The only game representation of a Space Marine i have ever seen to actually nail it. They are straight out of the Black LIbrary Fiction.The Orks are really well done, again, proper 40K style.I like the scenery, the bleak imposing architecture of the Manufactorums contrast with the tighter hab levels. Its not far off what i imagined a Hab world to be. The Melee combat is great, you feel like you are doing some awful damage.The guns, while not as much fun as melee, still have a satisfying punch. The bolter especially captures that big calibre bang well.Even on normal, it can be quite tough, you need to think as much as button mash. You are not invincible.Cons:It is essentially a corridor. A long pretty one but still, a corridor.I sometimes found the camera a bit wonky in tighter spaces, it would zoom in to the point i didnt realise quite how many Orks i had on me or, crucially, allow me to register how many Ork Shootas had me in LOS. I do suck at games mind you !.I tried playing on M/Keyboard at first..... You will need a game pad. It works nicely on a pad but obviously this limits control options.Overall i would say if you like action games and you like the 40K Universe then this is worth your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game for the fans of 40k. The action is faithful to the franchise, guns sound like they should, orcs are dumb and savage, Order of chaos wants to summon some demons, blood and gore is everywhere. For those who answer to question: ""What is 40k?"" this game is average action game without any appeal. Surprisingly, multiplayer still have some people playing it actively.			",203,56,9,27,27,2,24

												The game is very enjoyable. The campain is fun and can be quite hard in some areas, The ai of the enemy is quite intelegent and will do everything to kill you. Multiplayer is fun and allows you to customise almost your entire space marine or chaos. The extermartis is really fun to play and will have you wanting more. Dispite some small bugs in the multiplayer and op of a few weapons it plays how anyone would expect. Great game for all players and expecially for Warhammer 40k players.I rate it a 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was never interested in Warhammer. My friends were, but not me. Then my friend told me to get this game. I am a sucker for buying games. Tell me to buy a game, i'll get it*.I might not play it much, but this game is so fun. Multiplayer is good for die-hard fans but I don't reccomend the campaign to the Warhammer Fans, it's not that good.This is really good for if you want to troll the crap outta you're friends because nothing is more satifying than watching friend take a lascannon to the face, get maulled by a Thunder Hammer, Blown up but a charge shot and getting trolled by storm bolter. Despite my play-time on this game, its awesome. Amazing gameplay and one of the trolliest** multiplayer games ever! You don't have to be a major fan of the series, but you will when you buy it.

												Being a Warhammer 40,000 collector and fan of the amount of history in the universe, loving the Space Marine army. This game is great for giving you a chance to see a Space Marine in action as well as the world in the 41st Millennium where there is nothing but war.The campaign was great, really enjoyable combat against the toughest enemies to Mankind along with how the Imperium of Man's Forgeworlds are, especially the Titan Invictus. The multiplayer is the weakest part of the game, especially if you played on PS3/Xbox 360 due to the UI bug but the community gathered together and added members to play prearranged games and it rocked!Seeing what Space Marine had to offer, I saw it as a solid first step that had potential to evolve Space Marine into a better game with future sequels, sadly that chance won't come anytime soon since THQ went down and seeing what Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade has to offer. Having seen some gameplay of 40K:EC, it seems that the combat system is coming back with vengeance.But with every game comes at least one sin. If you know the Ultramarine history of the 2nd Company, Titus isn't the 2nd Company Captain, it's Cato Sicarius. Seeing Black Templars with an Inquisitor, a psyker?! Black Templars hate psykers due to their chapter's vows etc. Those are the only issue I had with the game story wise but still really enjoyed what Titus had to offer, a very solid character and inspirational. The last boss could of been better, more of a titanic clash.Scoring the game? I'll give it a big thumbs up and is a must try for any 40K fan!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is pretty fun. The Orc dialogue can get a bit boring with: Kill the Space Marine every 5 seconds. The linear map design hurts it also. The story is good. The graphics are console level so it loses points on that. The weapons are a bit overpowered but a lot of fun when you find a good one. You really don't notice the music most of the time, because you are too busy defending/attacking waves of enemies. The game reminds me of C&C: Renegade. I would say that the $7.49 is what the game is worth when it was released new. Not a lot of bugs found. Some glitches but not game breaking. I almost forgot the melee: It is badass'.

												I bought this game after playing the demo for 2 hours.  Originally, I purchsed Space Marine for the single player  because I had so much fun in the demo; however, upon opening the game program I jumped right in to multiplayer and put 30 hours into intense, satisfying, and sometimes frustrating PvP combat before I even started the single player missions.  I've put over 100 hours in to Space Marine and, with the (free) release of the Exterminatus 4-player co-op DLC, I plan spending a lot more time in this game.  I hope the game goes on sale soon because this title is one that will always welcome both new and return players.			",72,17,0,17,6,1,37

												Best Warhammer 40K game that gets to be on 3rd Person format.A very interesting story that needs you to exterminate your enemies to satisfy your thrill of whats going to happen next. There are Weapons to choose from and annihilate however you please which makes it just as exciting, and what's more is executing them brutally, either to regain your health or just for the fun of killing. Still graphically amazing even though its been years.Love the action and its animation. Though, it can get quite repetetive and can get boring after a few chapters. Where everything seems to be the same. But because of its story that reels you, there is some kind of balance that hides that boredom. Battle can get pretty challenging, a little sad for me because at each fail you can't even skip the cinematics. This game was an eduction for me as it is the first Warhammer 40K game that I have ever played. Learned a lot through it. It was quite the adventure. Definitely recommended.			",55,0,0,0,4,0,6

												-+-Single player only Review-+-[Before we start this review, let me say, I'm not one of the best gamers, in fact, I'm pretty bad at games, but I enjoy them alot, I love being part of the story and blowing things up]First half of the game, I really love.  There were some flaws, but killing endless waves of stupid green orks was a blast.  Ammo conservation was a minor issue, but I was having a really good time playing this game.As the story and progress went on, these flaws I encountered earlier, really began to be a problem.  Enemies don't drop ammo, there is no real cover system, and the controls were a bit clunky.  I love shooters to death, but Warhammer 40K: Ultramarine wants to be a special hybrid between a melee combat game as well as a shooter.  With clunky controls, it fails to pull off a seamless transition between melee combat to ranged.Another flaw, is your squadmates.  As you play alongside with your team, you get used to your allies being around you, and learn how to use them to your advantage, but during various points of the campaign, your buddies will leave you, and you have to face waves of enemies by yourself, which by then, being accustomed to having comrades to aid you in combat, the game becomes unbalanced and have to find new strategies to take down your enemies.Now, its time for me to address the issue with executions.  One of the few ways to regain points in your healthbar is by performing executions on your foes. This can only be done using melee attacks, and sometimes the animation of an execution may take 3 full seconds and can't be interrupted.  That being said, if you need health desperately you may have no other option.  While attempting an execution, it leaves your character exposed and he won't be able to defend himself as he's stuck in the middle of animation.  I've actually died several times during one of those events because there's no way out of it.The most unfair thing about this title are the boss battles.  In most games, its just player vs the boss.  Sometimes in the middle of the fight in those games, the boss would retreat and bring in his henchmen while he takes a break.  Not in this game.   While the boss is pummeling away at the player while firing all cylinders, all of his companions will be aiding him.  While there are not many of these fights, they are enough to want me to turn the game off.   Some enemies will be throwing grenades, others sniping, while the rest come fighting face to face.  There is no safeway out of boss battles, you basically have to roll around, dodge, and shoot hoping for the best outcome.As I progressed through the game, I learned to hate it.  It had alot of fun moments, being one Ultramarine vs 10,000 Orks was a pretty badass concept and helped my drive to beat the game, but I kept wondering what  unfair disadvantage will the game deliver next?  I once exited a corridor and the game came to a cutscene that introduced a new enemy.  In the cinematic my foe began firing at me.  As the game resumed, my character was standing out of cover while taking damage.  The final boss battle did me in. I finally gave in to its cheap tactics.  I could not finish the game.  I am angry that I fought this far, but could not finish the fight, it was just too difficult and unfair, I spent 98% of my ammo in my inventory before my enemies slain me, they would not go down and there was nowhere to replenish the ammunition. This game couldn't find its identity.  It borrows elements from Gears of War and Devil May Cry, but it didn't know what it wanted to be.  With all the complaining, the game does have some good moments. I really enjoyed the first part of this title and a few other moments in between the final chapters. Killing thousands of orks was satisfying. Very action packed, Michael Bay would be proud.  The storyline is kind of simple, but expands the imagination.Single Player Campaign Review Overall: 6.45 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the Warhammer 40k universe. This was a fun campaign to go through. What's better than fighting a bunch of Orks? How about Chaos! The only thing I didn't really like about the game was the combat system and mobility just felt really restrictive. Not enough to degrade the gameplay however. If you like Warhammer 40k you should pick this game up.			",145,14,1,15,15,0,11

												This game, although it doesnt seem to be the best graphical game or best shooter around, its definately a great game. Everything in this game adds up to a great experience. The story line of this game and all the settings make this a beautiful game. Some of the graphics aren't top notch but the way they are used and the well designed levels make you feel like your in a large open world with amazing designs. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the hack and slash shooter genre or anyone that likes Warhammer as this game does both justice. The game revolves around a Space Marine Captain who you play as and the event of an Ork invasion upon a Imperial Planet, fighting with the Gaurdsman you must stop the invansion at all costs. It seems like a basic shooter, but the weapons and enemys plus the twists and story will keep you entertained as you slash your way through hundreds of orks or blow their bodies apart with massive Laser Cannons. This is a very enjoyable game and although got a few glitches and bugs, still an amazing grab. Its definately worth the price. 8/10			",96,9,1,6,9,0,7

												A pretty fun 6-10 hour experiance depending on skill, as some sudden diffeculty spikes can be frustatingIts relativly lore friendly, with a stong focus on making you feel like the awesomely powerful Space Marine that you are suppose to bethere is a lot of small details like the adding of purity seals to your armour and how you carry your bolter or other weaponry while on the move that made all giddy insideThe story is somewhat predictable but it is told competantly, and the vox messages that you get from servo-skulls filling in some of the bagground of the story is, from my perspectiv at least, a nice addition, but unfortunatly missableNow my only real problem with the game is that i had a lot of frame drops and screen tearing on a rig that can run morden games like Witcher 3 without a problem, which i found very frustratingother then that though it looks and feels like 40k in a way few newer titels does, and it is diffenatly worthy of a playthrough if you like the universe			",398,122,2,112,48,5,108

												For a person that just got introduced to the Warhammer Lore, it's really good...for a THQ game that is. I'm not the type that plays online but the gameplay is very satisfying at times. The gameplay is somewhat similar to Gears of Wars where you hack n slash, shoot, and throw grenades at enemies as you progress in the story. There are no items to regain health, the only way to regain health is that you need to execute an enemy. If I'm going to be nitpicky, I have to say that the execution animations is somewhat off at times, but I'll let it slide seeing it's THQ that made this. There is this special that you become more powerful and regain health for the moment if you're being overrun by enemies.The story, as I got so far in the game, is that you play as Titus, Captain of the Ultramarines, to turn the tide on retaking the Forge world from the Orks and must defend the Titan ""Invictus"" from the Orks before they will kill the entire planet...I won't go any further on the story...but I can tell you that the ending is a cliff hanger...there was suppose to be a trilogy of this game but since THQ is no more and it's under another company, we will not see anymore sequels to this game.The game is good at the time of 2011. Personally, I do love the Space Marines.""We are the Spehss Mahreens! We are the emperor's fury!""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Every Warhammer game I have played I have liked.  And 40k Space marine is no different.  This game is just ok though.  When we choose to play a game in this day in age I feel if there is no true player progression in stats, leveling up, or points system in the single player campaign I feel a little flimflamed as my fun was not maximized.  And even new weapons and scheduled upgrades can stop the game from feeling devoid of true evolving space marine.  This game is a pure third person action games that isn't to long and should be easy on your wallet.  Fun steam achievement and a good time are reason enough to get this game if you have the time and find Space Marine on sale.			",201,26,1,35,8,2,36

												Really, really, really good stuff.If you ever wandered how it is to be this tactical, assault or devastator Space Marine you command in all earlier titles, how it is to smash orcs and chaos troops with your power weapon, now here is your chance.There is single player story mode, which introduces all weapons and enemies step by step in quite engaging story.There is 4 players coop in which you face waves of enemies getting more and more difficult. In this mode you select and play of of roles - tactical (standard hand weapons), devastator (heavy toys) or assault (jet pack, melee weapon and pistol). Each role is quite different, have it's pros and cons. With DLC you can also play as Chaos Marines (same roles) facing orcs, guardsmen and Space Marines [this mode is more difficult and more rare]. Downside of this mode is that only way to upgrade weapons is from pvp and it carries to this mode, you cannot earn weapon upgrades in this mode.Last is standard team PVP, few maps, good shooting, however I'm not a fan of it. However you can earn weapon upgrades here to boost your coop experience.Best if you have some friends who play, if not you are forced to play with random players, some of them are bad so it is quite hard to each last or bonus waves.Game is great for all fans of the series and fans of action games.Have fun.

												The metacritic rating for Space Marine is about right (74%), but I thoroughly enjoyed it because the developers painstakingly recreated the 40k universe. I don't think I know if another franchise-based game that feels quite as spot on. With that said, the gameplay does have a few issues. Combat borrows heavily from God of War, with the addition of a solid shooter component (sans cover mechanic, thankfully?); which is to say the combat has variety but lacks real depth. Multiplayer has serious ups and downs, due mostly to the lack of dedicated server support and MASSIVE lag issues if the host is not on your content (which happens about half of the time). The ""unlocks"" and leveling component offers a few gameplay options without breaking multiplayer. Also included is a co-op ""survival"" mode (up to 4 players), which only has a few maps but is a riot when you can pull together a few buds for a match. When Space Marine is on sale, it's a great buy for any Warhammer 40k fan.			",274,47,4,34,21,0,50

												Warhammer 40k..possibly the most epic fiction universe known to man..and heretics.. This game is probably the best 40k game I've played so far and the combat is super satisfying especially when you perform execution kills on those silly Greenskinz or those heretic chaos marines online. Story was good but a bit tad short but I wouldn't mind playing it all over again. Online has cool customizable features but for some reason the online community for Space Marine is a bit low..seems more people play this on the consoles but when you do find other players get ready for crazy fire fights and melee combat!

												     This game is a grippin thrid person shooter that pulls you into a world rich with lore right from the start. From the very beginning you feel excited to be a Space Marine and can tell that there are politics going on around you that can only be guessed at. This really adds to the feel of the game. As far as enemies go the orcs can be repetitive and you can start to wonder when you will have a new enemy, but seeing as you are attacking the orc planet its hard to criticize too much on that. They do mix it up well with different orc bosses and increasingly massive and heavily armored or infantry though.     My favorite thing about this game is the mutiplayer. Its crazy addictive and levelling up is a blast in it. I recomend this game to anyone who enjoys a game through the eyes of a true Lawfully Good alligned protagonist who values righteousness and honor above all else, and to anyone who enjoys a glimpse at a vast world that you are directly thrust into.

That itself is pretty much enjoyment.Everything else (story, leveldesign (extremely linear) and such) is still OK.If you like 40K: Get it!

Multiplayer is fun and allows you to customise almost your entire space marine or chaos. The extermartis is really fun to play and will have you wanting more. Dispite some small bugs in the multiplayer and op of a few weapons it plays how anyone would expect.

												Relic have really captured the feel of the 40k universe here and to take on a project as big as this given the fan base from the table top game they have done an outstanding job. Campaign storyline is involving, and gameplay is excellent with the camera moving well during melee combat and a wide selection of ranged weaponary, and a good spread of foe types, mission objectives are varied and challenging. Multiplayer is equal in it's enjoyment offering already three different game types with more and works very well in all, and the option to totally customise your characters armour and weapon loadouts keeps it interesting. It's too bad that the Orkish walkers Killa Kans were not in the main game dispite being featured in the trailers and screenshots. Still this was Relic's last Warhammer game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In the darkness of the 41st Millennium, there is only war. And Aliens. And Daemons. And things that go BOOM!Yep, a day in the life of a Space Marine, involving close combat mechanics, dodging enemy fire and zapping/powing/kersplatting the alien hordes. The mele combat is nice and visceral, and the shooting mechanics are pretty solid to boot. Fun little game, marred only by repetition and lack of scope. By no means a bad game, its fun, but a little lengthy in places and sometimes has yopu crying out for something new along the journey. Still, if you are a Games Workshop afficionado, this is a very faithful game to the lore of 40K.An 8/10 for fans of the IP, 7/10 for everyone else. Good little game but needs a bit more oomph.

It is always great fun when your pitching youself to fight to death. In campaign, it has a awesome storyline and plenty of orks to kill which is always fun, and I always enjoy doing a execution on the orks which is like really fun to do! I reccomand you play with your mouse because your going to have to react pretty fast in some of the battles. To finish it, I reccomand you to buy it instantly, however, do not purchase Dreadnought pack DLC, not many people have that dlc and it will be very hard finding a battle, however if you got friends that have that dlc feel free.

												Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a 3rd person shooter.I've played all Warhammer 40,000 video games. Some were good, and others were so great that I still play them, even several years after their release.This is one of the best 40k games, period. It nails everything- from what makes a good 3rd person shooter, to what makes a true-to-lore 40k game. To start off, This isn't your standard 3rd person-totally-not-gears-of-war game. Whilst most 3PSs focus on a cover system, Space Marine removes that entirely. You ARE the cover. You can wade into a mob of enemies, without dying every 3 seconds. It perfectly encapsulates what makes a space marine a space marine, and lets you experience that firsthand.The combat is divided into two parts- ranged and melee. You are given a wide variety of weapons to slaughter your enemies in different and uniquely brutal ways. Each weapon feels (and sounds!) exactly how it should. The shot of a bolter, the hiss of a meltagun, and the roar of a plasma cannon. And although the ranged weapons are cool, the melee weapons are even better. Chainswords (chainsaw-swords) evicerate and rend flesh whenever they strike, turning a large horde of orks into a bloody mess very quickly. Thunder hammers, although slow, deal tremendous damage and completly pulverise your enemies. The combat (especially in single player or the horde-mode) is immensly satisfying and one of the best parts of the game.The game has both a single-player and a multiplayer. The single player has a decently lengthy campaign (10-12 hours) with a pretty good story. It does have its faults (unfinished story arcs that will probably never get finished b/c r.i.p THQ). The multiplayer, although good and reasonably well balanced, gets repedative with the 4 maps (excluding expansions). You also can't choose which side you are on pre-match, meaning you might not even get to see your shiny new color scheme for a couple matches. The multiplayer also follows the standard 'level up to improve' philosophy, with special perks unlocked by completing challenges (some of which are brutally difficult without help). Overall, this is a fantastic 40k game that really makes you feel like you are playing a space marine.It's practically a badass simulator, 10/10 from me.			",59,0,0,6,1,0,7

												This game, although it doesnt seem to be the best graphical game or best shooter around, its definately a great game. Everything in this game adds up to a great experience. The story line of this game and all the settings make this a beautiful game. Some of the graphics aren't top notch but the way they are used and the well designed levels make you feel like your in a large open world with amazing designs. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the hack and slash shooter genre or anyone that likes Warhammer as this game does both justice. The game revolves around a Space Marine Captain who you play as and the event of an Ork invasion upon a Imperial Planet, fighting with the Gaurdsman you must stop the invansion at all costs. It seems like a basic shooter, but the weapons and enemys plus the twists and story will keep you entertained as you slash your way through hundreds of orks or blow their bodies apart with massive Laser Cannons. This is a very enjoyable game and although got a few glitches and bugs, still an amazing grab. Its definately worth the price. 8/10			",96,9,1,6,9,0,7

												У меня нет на руках статистических данных, но предполагаю, что вселенная Warhammer 40.000 — одна из популярнейших на сегодняшний день. По ней частенько выходят книги, на игровых сайтах регулярно появляются переводы рассказов и выдержек из кодексов. Но поскольку создавался этот мир для стратегической настолки, то и на компьютерах мы видели Warhammer 40.000 только как стратегию. И было здорово, конечно, но далеко не все любят этот жанр. Да и в роль вжиться не получалось — не было возможности почувствовать себя настоящим космодесантником.А когда она появилась, все «Вахолюбы» ринулись в бой сразу же. Причем часть из них признала проект шедевром буквально после трехминутного знакомства: «Тут можно самому управлять десантником, он на ЛКМ стреляет, на ПКМ рубит — что ещё надо?!»Всем нравится хорошая драка!Хоть такое обычно можно услышать про орков, в Space Marine именно главный герой — зачинатель потасовок и самый большой любитель их. В первые минуты после запуска не совсем понятно, какой именно будет игра. Все-таки вселенная богатая — тут вам интриги, простор для тактики, глобальность. Есть много всего, что из этого выберут для проекта разработчики — бог весть.А выбрали они грандиозное рубилово с участием тысяч врагов и крошечной группы десантников. И у нас есть два варианта действия: либо мы стреляем, либо мы рубим. Еще мы, конечно, пафосно разговариваем, но на такие мелочи жизни внимание не особо обращаешь.В каждой главе мы просто бежим сквозь уровень, где на нас валят толпища противников. Мы их неустанно мочим, а разработчики щедро дают добавки. Порой настолько щедро, что даже не понимаешь, с чем связано такое гостеприимство и на хрена нам так много драться.Если проводить аналогии, то перед нами что-то вроде Gears of War или God of War — рубилово, где все задачи сводятся к одному: УБЕЙ ИХ ВСЕХ!Не много о сетевом режиме.Тут у нас есть три режима («Захват точки» , «Командный бой» и «Экстерминатус» ) и система развития героя. То есть имеются готовые классы с базовыми умениями и оружием, но постепенно мы открываем что-то новое. Получение уровней тоже идет по проверенной схеме. За полезные действия (убийства, поддержка, захват точек) дают опыт, который накапливается… Ну и так далее.Получилось весьма интересно. Все-таки выбор способов уничтожения врагов велик, тактика за каждый класс своя. Можно тут и с реактивным ранцем попрыгать, и в ближнем бою врагов рубить, например.Сетевой режим в целом получился куда веселее, чем кампания. Он не надоедает дольше и вносит разнообразие. Все-таки кромсать других десантников увлекательнее, чем шинковать нескончаемые орды орков и хаоситов.Плюсы: боевик во вселенной Warhammer 40.000; масштабные поединки; весьма хороший арсенал; реактивный ранец; сетевой режим; орки!Минусы: однообразие действий; мало карт и режимов в сетевом режиме.

												-+-Single player only Review-+-[Before we start this review, let me say, I'm not one of the best gamers, in fact, I'm pretty bad at games, but I enjoy them alot, I love being part of the story and blowing things up]First half of the game, I really love.  There were some flaws, but killing endless waves of stupid green orks was a blast.  Ammo conservation was a minor issue, but I was having a really good time playing this game.As the story and progress went on, these flaws I encountered earlier, really began to be a problem.  Enemies don't drop ammo, there is no real cover system, and the controls were a bit clunky.  I love shooters to death, but Warhammer 40K: Ultramarine wants to be a special hybrid between a melee combat game as well as a shooter.  With clunky controls, it fails to pull off a seamless transition between melee combat to ranged.Another flaw, is your squadmates.  As you play alongside with your team, you get used to your allies being around you, and learn how to use them to your advantage, but during various points of the campaign, your buddies will leave you, and you have to face waves of enemies by yourself, which by then, being accustomed to having comrades to aid you in combat, the game becomes unbalanced and have to find new strategies to take down your enemies.Now, its time for me to address the issue with executions.  One of the few ways to regain points in your healthbar is by performing executions on your foes. This can only be done using melee attacks, and sometimes the animation of an execution may take 3 full seconds and can't be interrupted.  That being said, if you need health desperately you may have no other option.  While attempting an execution, it leaves your character exposed and he won't be able to defend himself as he's stuck in the middle of animation.  I've actually died several times during one of those events because there's no way out of it.The most unfair thing about this title are the boss battles.  In most games, its just player vs the boss.  Sometimes in the middle of the fight in those games, the boss would retreat and bring in his henchmen while he takes a break.  Not in this game.   While the boss is pummeling away at the player while firing all cylinders, all of his companions will be aiding him.  While there are not many of these fights, they are enough to want me to turn the game off.   Some enemies will be throwing grenades, others sniping, while the rest come fighting face to face.  There is no safeway out of boss battles, you basically have to roll around, dodge, and shoot hoping for the best outcome.As I progressed through the game, I learned to hate it.  It had alot of fun moments, being one Ultramarine vs 10,000 Orks was a pretty badass concept and helped my drive to beat the game, but I kept wondering what  unfair disadvantage will the game deliver next?  I once exited a corridor and the game came to a cutscene that introduced a new enemy.  In the cinematic my foe began firing at me.  As the game resumed, my character was standing out of cover while taking damage.  The final boss battle did me in. I finally gave in to its cheap tactics.  I could not finish the game.  I am angry that I fought this far, but could not finish the fight, it was just too difficult and unfair, I spent 98% of my ammo in my inventory before my enemies slain me, they would not go down and there was nowhere to replenish the ammunition. This game couldn't find its identity.  It borrows elements from Gears of War and Devil May Cry, but it didn't know what it wanted to be.  With all the complaining, the game does have some good moments. I really enjoyed the first part of this title and a few other moments in between the final chapters. Killing thousands of orks was satisfying. Very action packed, Michael Bay would be proud.  The storyline is kind of simple, but expands the imagination.Single Player Campaign Review Overall: 6.45 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As an assault marine, you can't kill someone with a thunder hammer which does OP damage. However, once they kill you, your exploding jumppack will kill them for you. 10/10 would jump pack kill again.Edit: I felt that I should make an actual helpful review. Campaign is amazing, and unlocks both a skin for Chaos and the Ultramarines in MP if you beat it. In MP, lascannons are two-shot kills, one-shot headshots. Thunderhammer is good if you can sneak up on someone. Lots of higher tier weapons are good at one-shots. The only MP servers are siege control standard, and exterminatus.Exterminatus is amazing. You and a team of up to three others [solo is allowed] fight five waves of orks before moving to the next arena. There are five arenas total, each with stronger enemies. Tactical is good for when using dual weapons, devastator has certain spots that make it OP, and the assault isn't that good at anything except escaping. Exterminatus is good for low level players since the PvP servers are full of max level people. Also, exterminatus lets you kill hundreds of orks without mercy for no other reason than you can.

												Originally I had given this game a poor review because I couldn't get it running after hours of trying. I finally got it to work. It's actually a fantastic game, especially given the♥♥♥♥♥♥Warhammer 40k games are out there. Good graphics, especially for the age of the game, decent action, and nice story.I'd highly recommend it, though keep in mind the audio glitch and game crashing on launch could still happen.OLD REVIEW:I wish I could write an actual review of this game, but I simply can't play it. On Windows 7 the game had a horrific audio bug from the moment game play began. The audio for everything on screen would start to echo until the 10 Orks sounded like 500 and the 3 shots I fired sounded like 100. I tried every fix from power settings, graphics options, compatibility mode, playing further into the game, and nothing worked.On windows 10 now it won't even let me open the game. I click it and it crashes instantly.			",99,14,0,12,4,1,13

Unlockable perks increase your tactical options and offer some fun combinations to take to the field. On the downside pretty much the only format being played online is ""Point Capture"".

												It was about time a development team took on an action/adventure game based on the Warhammer 40K universe given the endless possibilities for epic battles and complex story-telling and boy does this game pull it off. Intense endless battles through hordes of Orks and cheeky little (if somewhat predictable) plot twists make this game a must buy especially for those who have never ventured into the Warhammer 40K universe.8/10Pros/Cons+ Graphics are very good, especially for a game of this scale in terms of world and battles.+ The collectible servo-skulls added a nice backdrop of storyline at a steady pace.+ Diverse enemies and encounters keep the plot and game play from going stale.+ Combat is very fluid and mixes from gun to melee use extremely well.- If you know anything about the Warhammer 40K universe then the story will be predictable.- The storyline was a tiny bit too short for me even with the collectible servo-skulls feature.

												I know nothing about Warhammer.  I don't know why orks who are basically scrapyard junkers can fly spaceships, why it's the far future but humanity worships a machine god, why some of the dialogue is vaguely medieval, or why Space Marines are all at least SEVEN FEET TALL.  What I do know is that this is a pretty decent third-person shooter.  It's basically Warcraft (which I DO know about) meets Gears of War.  The campaign will only last you 7-8 hours, and from what I understand, the multiplayer has several modes (thanks to AFatalPapercut for correcting me on this)  but no campaign co-op.  If it's on a good sale, pick it up.  Graphics are pretty decent, but with few customization options.  Voice acting is good, optimization is so-so considering the game is 5 years old.  There are occasional absurd difficulty spikes, but the controls are easy, and mingling a fair amount of melee weapons and combat into the game works surprisingly well.			",203,15,1,24,18,0,26

												Campaign is a fun romp through an ork infested forgeworld, short but enjoyable, final boss is a little dissapointing but otherwise ok.Obviously i put alot of hours into multiplayer and despite being several years old at this point still has an active if somwhat small playerbase for online matches. Multiplayer itself consists of standard versus modes, TDM, CTF and control points capture with chaos marines v space marines. Exterminatus is four player co-op against ai orks and chaos at later stages.Sadly some maps are DLC which means you may have some difficulty finding matches for chaos map pack or dreadnaught mode.Pick it up on sale, it is cheap and you'll get your money's worth out of the single player if you enjoy 40K and action games.If you do play multiplayer prepare to rage at assault marines as they zip about on jump packs and stove your face in with a power axe.

												Nice and solid multiplayer (even this late since it has been released). None of the classes are definitively stronger than one another, aside from the multiplayer though, the single player is nothing to drool over. You can play it once and it's not bad, but it has close to none replay value. If you're a warhammer 40k fan though, I highly recommend this game, as it's the only installment of a first person (you control one character I don't know what that's called) game for warhammer 40k.If you're not a warhammer 40k fan, again, the multiplayer is pretty solid to be honest. Get it when it's on sale, it's not a bad 10 buck or less game. The campaign? Eh.Hope this helps.			",148,18,0,18,5,0,15

												So much about this game solid, even great at times, and the storyline is a treat for any fans of the 40K franchise. The voice acting is often remarkable, considering the content, and the character design and even the weapon loadouts are solid. The great problem is that it's all let down by incredibly lazy and infuriatingly repetitive gameplay. Endless waves of the same mobs, generally unimaginative level design (although it looks great) and totally ineffectual allies make for little more than a lazy, dated shooter.The tedium is very occasionally broken by flying segments, but all-in-all someone at the top has wasted the fantastic work of their underlings and a potentially unparalleled IP. If for no other reason, buy it so that new leadership might be able to justify a sequel. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Relic took solid third-person concepts and crafted them into an excellent atmospheric piece that boasts their same care and attention to detail that they bestowed upon the Dawn of War titles.  Space Marine’s main strength is its well balanced combat system that makes the transition between ranged and melee combat seamless; blasting at a hoard of Orks with your bolter before wading in with your chainsword is tonnes of gory fun. The visuals are still fantastic, really capturing the dark and foreboding atmosphere of the 40k universe. While the story is straightforward enough for 40k veterans and laymen to understand and enjoy equally, that said the single player is somewhat short and the level design while beautifully detailed is restrictively linear at points. Unfortunately, with the collapse of THQ Space Marine will not be getting the two sequels it deserved leaving the cliff hanger ending somewhat bitter sweet.I recommend this game to anyone be they 40k enthusiasts or just a fan of the hack and slash genre in general.

												Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine is an interesting game. It's a linear hack-and-slash / shooter, and it's got some good flavor to it. I criticize a lot of shooters for a lack of variety in enemies, but in Warhammer 4K Space Marine it's more about crowd control and being extra careful with the huge guys than bottle-necking and taking cover (because there are no cover mechanics). It's about pushing through but doing so in a calculated manner and it feels rewarding.			",100,13,2,4,14,0,11

												""For the Emperor, Space Marine""       - Imperial GaurdsmanWarhammer 40k: Space Marine is a third person hack and slash, shooter hyrbrid developed by Relic (renowned for their success witht he Dawn of war series). PlotSet in a paralell Warhammer 40k universe, you play as Captain Titus, commander of the famous Ultramarines 2nd Company. Your task is liberate forge world, 'Graia' from a massive ork invasion. All is not as it seems however, as secrets lay hidden on this forge world, ones which links to the age old foe...GameplayAs mentioned previously, game plays between third person shooter and hack and slash. CampaignThere are chapters with each one having levels which are unlocked as you progress through the campaign. At the start of each level you need to clear the area of enemies and continue moving foward. The map design is quite linear so you won't find yourself getting lost much. Ocassionally there are other objectives which involve activating switches, collecting items defending area and elminating all hostiles. Although starting off with a simple combat knife and pistol, you can find new weapons later on including a bolter, marksman rifle, plasma pistol, plasma rifle as well as grenades. You can carry four weapons at once, but they are can only be swapped between certain weapons e.g. bolter pistol swap for plasma pistol, bolter rifle swap with plasma rifle etc. You can only re-supply at specific weapon crates either in between levels or on the battle field.  There are a variety of foes including shooters, nobs, rokkit boys, slugga boys, weird boys, bloodletters, heretics. Boss battles are also prevailent, testing your mettle a warboss, gunship and chaos lord. You have a energy shield which recharges when you are not under fire. You also have health is recharged at the start of each level or by executing enemies. I did face a few glitches such as enemies failing to spawn, which prevented me to progress in the game. I also didn't like the fact that health was only recovered via executions as they left me vulnerable at times.MultiplayerMultiplayer is a blast to play. There are two game modes Exterminatus and VS mode. Exterminatus pits you (either by your self or up to 3 other players) against up to 20 waves of foes. There are three classes two choose from which are: Tactical, Devestator and Assault. Tactical is basically your jack of all trades. Able to wield rifles and combat knife. Devestator is a range power house who excels at range, but poor in melee. Assault marines have jump packs to get quickly to foes, equiping unique melee weapons and pistol to excel at close range, though lacking against further foes. As you play you can level you earn scores based on the number of foes you defeat. After each match, you gain expereiince which is used to unlock new classes, weapons and perks. There are a few maps to choose from with each one pitting you against the Orks. You will face a variety of foes including sluggas, shooters, rokkit boys (basically all the guys from campaign except the bosses). After the last wave (i.e.20)  there is abionus round which pits you against the forces of chaos. Vs mode pits the loyalist vs the ruinous powers of chaos. one team plays as space marines while the other as chaos space marines. Your goal is to capture the points located in the area. The team that has the most tickets wins at the end of the match. You start with all classes available to you, but you have to unlock new weapons by completing challenges. Such challenges include defeating a certain number of enemies with a particular weapon for instance.AudioAudio is excellent. Weapons sound powerful to wield. Voice acting sounds the same as 'Dawn of war' which I felt was great.GraphicsThe graphics are good, but not spectacular. Models and textures are decent. Plenty of blood and gore though, so it fits the 40k universe quite well.Overall if you are a fan of the 40k universe or want a fun hack and slash game, get Space Marine.			",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

It was fun from the very start to the very finish, great voice, hold up pretty well visually for its age, combat was fantastic fun and all the weapons felt good.  You get to fight along side some Blood Ravens briefly and some droped in Ultramarines, but I would of loved more of that. Its a good game if you fancy a solid 40k sp. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You wanna know what it feels like when you spray down a dozen orks with one bolter mag and then switch to your chainsword, kill another dozen and top it all off by executing an ork nob tearing his head off and finally notice that you always wanted to know what an ultramarine armour looks like all covered in blood?

												Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine is an interesting game. It's a linear hack-and-slash / shooter, and it's got some good flavor to it. I criticize a lot of shooters for a lack of variety in enemies, but in Warhammer 4K Space Marine it's more about crowd control and being extra careful with the huge guys than bottle-necking and taking cover (because there are no cover mechanics). It's about pushing through but doing so in a calculated manner and it feels rewarding.			",100,13,2,4,14,0,11

												It's an awsome game, and a nice add to your already existing 40k collection (if you have one. If you don't GO GET ONE!!!!! :P). Yes the game has invisible walls, yes it's lineair, yes the story is not the best one out there. But when you open up a heavy bolter on a horde of orcs you forget all that and just want more orcs to kill. A must have!!!			",37,6,1,5,15,0,16

												As an assault marine, you can't kill someone with a thunder hammer which does OP damage. However, once they kill you, your exploding jumppack will kill them for you. 10/10 would jump pack kill again.Edit: I felt that I should make an actual helpful review. Campaign is amazing, and unlocks both a skin for Chaos and the Ultramarines in MP if you beat it. In MP, lascannons are two-shot kills, one-shot headshots. Thunderhammer is good if you can sneak up on someone. Lots of higher tier weapons are good at one-shots. The only MP servers are siege control standard, and exterminatus.Exterminatus is amazing. You and a team of up to three others [solo is allowed] fight five waves of orks before moving to the next arena. There are five arenas total, each with stronger enemies. Tactical is good for when using dual weapons, devastator has certain spots that make it OP, and the assault isn't that good at anything except escaping. Exterminatus is good for low level players since the PvP servers are full of max level people. Also, exterminatus lets you kill hundreds of orks without mercy for no other reason than you can.

												It was about time a development team took on an action/adventure game based on the Warhammer 40K universe given the endless possibilities for epic battles and complex story-telling and boy does this game pull it off. Intense endless battles through hordes of Orks and cheeky little (if somewhat predictable) plot twists make this game a must buy especially for those who have never ventured into the Warhammer 40K universe.8/10Pros/Cons+ Graphics are very good, especially for a game of this scale in terms of world and battles.+ The collectible servo-skulls added a nice backdrop of storyline at a steady pace.+ Diverse enemies and encounters keep the plot and game play from going stale.+ Combat is very fluid and mixes from gun to melee use extremely well.- If you know anything about the Warhammer 40K universe then the story will be predictable.- The storyline was a tiny bit too short for me even with the collectible servo-skulls feature.

												I know nothing about Warhammer.  I don't know why orks who are basically scrapyard junkers can fly spaceships, why it's the far future but humanity worships a machine god, why some of the dialogue is vaguely medieval, or why Space Marines are all at least SEVEN FEET TALL.  What I do know is that this is a pretty decent third-person shooter.  It's basically Warcraft (which I DO know about) meets Gears of War.  The campaign will only last you 7-8 hours, and from what I understand, the multiplayer has several modes (thanks to AFatalPapercut for correcting me on this)  but no campaign co-op.  If it's on a good sale, pick it up.  Graphics are pretty decent, but with few customization options.  Voice acting is good, optimization is so-so considering the game is 5 years old.  There are occasional absurd difficulty spikes, but the controls are easy, and mingling a fair amount of melee weapons and combat into the game works surprisingly well.			",203,15,1,24,18,0,26

												TLDR – Space Marine is a third person hack & slash shooter taking place in the world of Warhammer 40k. If you’re working your way through the games in the Humble Relic Bundle, Space Marine is a great way to round out your Warhammer experience after beating the Dawn of War Real Time Strategy games. Remember Starcraft Ghost, the first person shooter taking place in the Starcraft universe? Me neither because that game was cancelled. But Space Marine is a decent approximation of what I think that game would have been like. You encounter the distinctive enemies of Warhammer and lead your squad through a war torn world beset on all sides by alien hordes.In this chapter of the Warhammer 40k saga, you play Captain Titus of the Ultramarines (like regular Space marines, but more ultra I guess). Your mission is to infiltrate a planet under massive Ork attack and secure a vital strategic asset before the Orks can get their grubby mitts on it. The Orks (with their British accents) are generally scavengers and will pick apart any technology they can get, including the super secret weapon that happens to be on this particular planet, so it’s up to you to stop them. The game is played in the third person perspective, like Mass Effect but with no real cover system and much more emphasis on melee fighting. You have a small selection of guns and a few melee power weapons that will be familiar to people who’ve played the Warhammer games, for example the chain sword and power axe. The guns are reasonably powerful and you can mow down waves of enemies with your limited ammo before getting to the hack and slash melee fighting. At key points in the game you also get access to the badass jetpack that you often see space marines run around with in the RTS games. The Orks almost always come in large numbers so get used to the melee portion, it will make or break your game experience. Orks aren’t your only enemies though, and you’ll find yourself under attack by forces of Chaos closer to the end who are significantly more difficult to deal with.Pros:+Greater immersion in the Warhammer world since you won’t be getting an overhead view like the real time strategy games. You’ll actually be dropped into it playing as a single person fighting xenos in the name of the emperor. Enemies from the Dawn of War games like Nobs and Chaos demons are real threats, unlike their counterparts in the other games.+Decent story, and some flavor added through “servo skulls” which act as personal logs (similar to the recordings in the Bioshock games). These give you some background on the world you fighting for, and the enemies you’re up against.+The game has multiplayer with some people playing, so I was able to join a few cooperative matches when I wanted to try it out. Cons:-This might be a personal problem, but I seemed to get headaches when playing this game for more than an hour. It probably has to do with the movement of the camera as your Space marine stomps around in his power armor.-There’s a bug with one of the servo skulls if you’re going for the achievement to collect them all. Just get this one last and you should be good. Fortunately you can load specific chapters from the start menu.Note that the difficulty of the game skyrockets in the last half hour or so of the story. The rest of the game is pretty straightforward and you can take your time, but suddenly you’re all alone up against a horde of powerful foes. Overall though, the game is fun and I would recommend it to any fan of the Dawn of War games or action games in general. ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

												Decent campaign, was supposed to be the first in a trilogy but sadly we've only gotten this one.Exterminatus can be fun but gets very repetetive very quickly.Playerbase in Versus is very low, you will only ever find a single lobby going on in either Seize Ground or Annihilation throughout the day. Matches will usually always be onesided because of either big groups, highly skilled individuals or rampant cheaters. Expect heavy lag.Very fun and satisfying combat, but can be very clunky at times.Graphics are good for its age.Unless you are an avid third-person shooter player, don't mind lag and cheaters and are a fan of Warhammer 40k, not recommended.

												While I have only a few hours played on PC, I played this game for more than 100 hours on Xbox 360. Set in the future where there is only war, you play as a Space Marine super soldier fighting for humanitys right to survive. The campaign is interesting enough and the flow is solid. Can be Repetitive.Multiplayer:At first it might seem like a bunch of super soldiers flying around and cutting you up. Because thats what it is. While there are sniper rifles and other guns many plays like to play as a sword or hammer wielding maniac who charges straight at you.The servers still have some life but its nothing like it once was.Survival mode:Basically, you and a small squad fight against a set number of waves to complete an objective. Waves get harder as they go and it can get really hard.Overall, this game is solid and offered me countless hours of fun in a genre where Warhammer Games have been a let down.

												this game has a pathetic story, the multiplayer is unfare and will make anyone who plays it want to cry because it is a very pointless and bland. However, this game is probably the most satisfying in the world for one reason: it has insane amounts of blood and you get to grind off large amounts of ugly creatures with a giant magic electric power hammer of death and a jetpack which you can use to fly from place to place curbstomping the creatures faces. If this is not reason enough to buy it then you have no life and I would ask you to leave this life and go pollute hell with your company :) (I neglected to review this when it came out but it deserves a review since it is glorious)			",56,1,2,7,1,2,9

												This game has been on my wishlist for at least 2 years and i've only been able to get it recently thanks to a sale.Man, i just cannot get over how awesome the atmosphere is in this game.I had a ton of fun playing the single player campaign, it was made superbly, as well as being well written in my opinion. I really felt like i was a spacemarine myself. I felt like i was Captain Titus.I felt like i was the only thing standing between the forces of orks+chaos and the survival of all mankind. I felt like i was the hand of the emperor, crushing all that stood in my way. The amount of playtime you could get with this game could vary but it may well be hours upon hours.The multiplayer option allows for either you and a few other spacemarines to take on chaosmarines in full fledged combat or you and a few other spacemarines on an Exterminatus mission where you must purge an area full of xenos.You can customize your spacemarine so you can look like the badass you've always dreamed you'd be and mete out some death and destruction.The graphics are pretty good as you see explosions everywhere, lasers and bullets flying as well. Relic entertainment did a great job on how the world itself would be made, the details on the environments really made me believe that in the future there is only war.10/10Life is the emperor's currency, spend it well..on playing games and all that.

												Let's start out with saying Captain Titus is a badass and he'd still be a badass even if he never was a Space Marine. But lucky for us, he is! So that means Badassius Titanius gets to play with toys that are too brutal for videogames. F*ck that, this is Space Marine, even if it's the Ultrasmurfs.Jokes aside, Single Player pits you in the skin of Captain Titus. The story is a bit predictable, the Orcs are attacking, but you don't really care anyway. This is Space Marine and you have a duty to do. Which is to brutally slaughter Orcs in the most gratuitous way, largely. I won't spoil who the secret enemies are who will start attacking you late-game. (CHAOS MARINES SHHHHH)Health packs are for Heretics. You regain health by stunning an enemy and using a finisher on them.You can carry four firearms, whereof two can be swapped out as you so desire. The array of firearms is classical, with every typical playstyle covered sooner or later. The weapons rarely feel underpowered, but you do have a sense of ""wrong place, wrong weapon"" at times, which urges you to keep a weapon variation based on distances. Something for close, something for far.Three melee weapons, whereof the Hammer limits your firearm usage to your sidearm or bolter.Melee feels strong and satisfying. Whenever enemies get close, you'll feel like you can rely on melee to finish them off relatively easily. Using the hammer makes you prone to rush in and tear them up, a tactic better fitting with Orcs or equipped with a Jetpack (which is only available on specific areas, sadly)If anything, Single Player makes for a great tutorial on how to handle Multiplayer, which is pretty unforgiving.Multiplayer is pretty much how you imagine Space Marines going at it. It's big, it's harsh and a little bit quick, as your health does not match that of Titus.All the weapons you encountered in the Singleplayer are present, and an extra melee weapon if you bother to buy it's DLC for it. The way you go about choosing weaponry is unusual and interesting.You start out with just one class. Which is the classic Bolter. BUT, you can copy the weapon loadout of the person who killed you. No requirements. If you got killed by a guy with a jetpack, copy it and get some payback. Respawning is fast too.This balances out with being only possible once. Dying again only makes you able to copy that killer's loadout, or pick a class.Reaching level 4, you'll unlock two things.First, a customization slot, allowing you to put together your own class type(normal, heavy or jet♥♥♥♥♥) with the unlocked weapons available to that class type. Then you can read up on the weapon specs and the available (locked or unlocked) perks a class can have. They are various, and many complement a different playstyle with the same class. Variety is endless, and I'm sure that, having unlocked enough over time, you can cater to your own playstyle.Secondly, you can customize your Space and Chaos Marine.Meaning, you can swap out unlocked armor pieces and color your Space Bad*ss in any way you like. In general, the armor has a primary color for the brunt of it, and a secondary such as for trimming and extremities.The color availability itself is pretty impressive and funnily applicable. Imagine picking colors for a car in GTA or Saints Row, that's the kind of options you get to deal with. You get Reds, Yellows, Blues, Greens, then Metallic's and all that jazz. It's pretty hilarious how your Space Marine suddenly is painted like a car.You can also choose the emblem that'll appear on your left shoulder armor. But if you are thinking of coloring your Space Marine in honor of a known existing Space Marine chapter, you shouldn't bother putting in the work. These color schemes are readily available for both Space and Chaos Marines, at no cost or unlocking requirement. Including their emblem.If you like 3rd person shooters with an emphasis on badassery and without sissy features like crouching or cover-based shooting, then Warhammer 40k Space Marine is right up your alley.

												Great game.Space Marine stands alone as third person shooter. It has solid mechanics as well as a pretty decent story. Game mechanics are unique in that there is a great moveset for each melee weapon, and the game is built around maintaining ferocity in close combat and securing execution kills in order to maintain HP. There are no health pickups or regenerating health (although there is a shield/armor mechanic that functions in this manner in addition to the HP). The multiplayer is very solid, with both versus and exterminatus (co-op) being very dynamic and fluid. However, if you're a fan of the Warhammer 40,000 universe in general this game is even more of a treat for you. Seeing the familiar factions rendered in loving detail up-close like this is absolutely awesome. Discovering more of the world's lore through the servo skulls and seeing nods and references to elements of the RTS games were great. Everything is very authentic and recognizable, and it's a great addition to a Warhammer 40k fan's library.Either way you look at it, this game is a purchase that you wouldn't regret. A high energy, vibrant third person action game.			",253,31,6,40,55,4,69

I was so wrong. The game offers a great view how a casual day in the life of a space marine looks like. And the graphic is decent.

												The future is grim.  The future is cockney...This seems to be one of those games you either love or hate.  I’m definitely in the love camp for this simple yet astonishingly over the top bloodbath.  This was my first contact with the games workshop stuff, and it’s a pretty cool IP.  Playing as Captain Titus, some sort of monastic space warrior lord, complete with chunky baby-blue armour and a few chums, you must save a factory planet from about a bazillion cockney-accented space orcs.  At its core, game design is not very nuanced or progressive; you shoot, grenade, and chainsaw your way through masses and masses of enemies, with little bits of jet-packing here and there.  Despite that, Space Marine is just so much damned fun I could barely put it down, even on my second play through.  For one, this is pure, unadulterated power fantasy with amps turned up to 11. Combat unfolds something like an early Slayer album, as waves upon wave of baddies (who all sound like Hackney cab drivers, for some reason) charge you in cathartic and blissfully chaotic battles which are exhilarating from start to finish. Your green-skinned adversaries often try overwhelm you with sheer numbers, which gives the game a crowd control element not common in these types of shooters; in small numbers, you can paint the walls red with them, but when 30 of the boys run in for a scrum, you’re in for a real slug.  By the end, you will have spilled oceans of blood, as it flies frequently and with reckless abandon.  Add in some great weapons (chain-sword and vengeance launcher, anyone?) and exquisite sound design which adds weight to your weapons and agony to the cries of your foes, and you’ve got one hell of a game. Second, this game gives you something different in that there’s no cover system and no health packs.  Instead, health is regained by using your melee weapon to gloriously eviscerate any enemies; perhaps you’re also some sort of space vampire?  Anyway, it means you must do some gritty hand to hand fighting, and more crowd control as enemies will try to scrum you when you go to replenish your health, making battles even more desperate and ultimately fun. Graphically, this is nothing too special, but it runs well on even modest pcs, and I had good framerates all the way.  I enjoyed the story, although I had to hit Wikipedia a few times to understand what was going on in the wider universe as well as some of the terminology.  I also though the music was very fitting, especially as ominous horn blasts herald charges of green fury.  I haven’t tried the multiplayer yet, so I can’t comment on that.My only real beef is that that Captain Titus and his two buddies are such boring, unemotional and uncharismatic characters. From what i've read online, there are other much more interesting space marine armies, like space vikings, space ninjas and space goths.  Wouldn't you rather play as a space viking?Even though I’m not a games workshop boy, I had a cathartic blast playing through Space Marine, twice.  It’s not subtle, nuanced, or revolutionary. What it is, is just damn good fun.  I dunno what happened to the devs after THQ went bust, but I’d love to see a sequel or successor to this one day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't fool your selves. War is all we are, killing is all we are good for! We are weapons, there is the Emperor and there is war. Nothing more.We stand victorious in the Emperor's shadow. Know that we are the Emperor's angels of death, not his angels of mercy. We shall not fall.Spacemarine is true fans must buy. It gives entirely new perpective to life of space marines in form of fast action third person shooter. Intensive battles wont leave anyone cold and cutting through even the most massive Ork hordes is easy, you are the best of the beast after all. You are Ultramarine.Game looks great and it has lot to offer. When getting bored to story, try out the mutiplay mode and create your unice space marine and chaos marine. take against other players in multiple different ways, or take team of 4 to fight against Ork hordes and see who is the best warrior.if there is something bad I would have to say about the game, contaisn spoilers   I would have wished stupid Ork moments. they act very generic shooter villains in this one. I understand why their boss acts the way he does but rest of the Orks dont really talk. I would have wished them to be silly and bit stupid. Also final boss was disappointing. When he mutated into Daemon prince, I was expecting something super massive boss fight. But instead it was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥space bar and sometimes dodging his attacks ones in a while. It was highly disappointig.  But rest of the game is nice to play for quite long time (especially whe u get better in multiplay mode)			",108,16,4,29,13,3,19

												Hugely underrated game in my opinion. I played it a few times in offline mode so hours didn't get counted, i probably have about 40h playtime.I really enjoyed the story and the gameplay. Also considering how unplayably bad most WH:40k games are this is a shining beacon :)It's not the longest story mode and the multiplayer is not usable(unless you have enough friends to play with) since nobody plays anymore. But it's pretty cheap nowadays so i think it's very worth it.			",139,15,2,35,13,2,23

												I have played Warhammer 40k since the series’ first came out as an RTS and I’m a big fan, that said; Space-Marine is not their best work even though it is fun to play. Meaning it is very satisfying to crush trough endless waves of Orcs and Daemons as an all-powerful space marine commander, but it gets old after a while. This game is good, but not great.

												Phenomenal, one of the very few 40k games that captures the feel of what it should be like to be a space marine, the only downside to this game is that the multiplayer is so laggy that it hurts.... and melta guns.... noob destruction on an epic level!Exterminatus keeps this game alive long after the Single player campaign is over, basically its The Last Stand from Dawn of war in 3rd person			",279,91,15,26,21,3,53

												A very good exercice for the ones like me that have a stressfull job, its action from the get go until the end, its a diferent gameplay in the Warhammer universe, but i think the main objective was acomplished, deliver entertainement and on that regard, space marine worth it, even at current price with no sale discount.The graphics not being nothing awesome, they are still good, voice acting very good and the story is good enough to keep you playing, but the strong point of this game is the gameplay full of action, gore and some funny moments with Orcs, who doesnt like Orcs?If you are fan of this universe theme, space marine will let you experience what you already know in a completly diferent perspective, so il give this game 7.5/8 and recommend you to try out.

												Kind of cool for the first 10 minutes, then you realise the rest of the game is pretty much the same thing.Boasts that you don't need to need to take cover like those other sissy games (you gain health by killing guys)... so basically it doesn't feature tactical movement or thinking? Great?Guns are for the most part pretty useless, you just spring in and mash melee, and things die.As for realising the setting and lore of the franchise, it does a pretty good job. The art direction is pretty good, your guy does kind of move and sound like a walking tank... but the bolters just feel and sound like standard issue rifle type deals.It's pretty to look at, but boring to play.

												This game's tons of fun for a 40k player.  As of 2 yrs after its release id say mostly just for 40k players. Why? Well theres not many on multiplayer anymore. You can find a match but only in certain gameplay modes, hardly ever in the DLC. The combat is really fun and although the campaign isnt the best ever, its still pretty fun for the story and gunning down tons of foes. Then again, 40k fans seem to be focused mostly on the slaughter of xenos so thats perfect. As for others, its a good introductory and if you want to feel like a tank on legs, get this game. try the demo at least because the gameplay pretty damn fun. Also btw, these space marines were created back in the 80s so they never copied anyone else, its the other way around			",131,19,1,15,2,2,7

												Space Marine is a very interesting game. It's got several different modes (single player, exterminatus, and versus), each one of which plays very differently. Single player is a typical Warhammer 40K story; i found it quite engaging and interesting, but i'm a fan of the genre. Exterminatus is where you fight wave after wave of enemy, with up to 3 other people. Versus is your typical death match type game. What really makes it stand out to me is how fast-paced the game play is, and how fluidly it blends attacks together. There's also a variety of play styles it supports - you can be a Raptor, or a tactical marine, or what have you. It's got enough variety to keep things interesting for a while.I also really enjoyed that you could play as chaos in exterminatus and versus modes.The character customization is a lot of fun if you are a fan of Warhammer 40K. I was able to get my emperor's children guy looking just about perfect.			",967,338,41,140,155,7,240

												In Dawn of War I, a Space Marine was a faceless soldier slogging through the mud alongside a hundred others, individually weak and collectively strong. In the expansions, the commander got personalised gear, but gameplay didn't change much. Victory came through a horde of power-armoured grunts swamping the enemy. It was strategic. In Dawn of War II, Space Marines were your Brothers. You, Commander, had a face, a personalised fighting style, and Sergeants who had actual voices. Victory  was achieved by taking cover and outflanking the enemy. It was tactical. In Space Marine, you are a superhuman soldier, son of Guilliman. You bring death from above as you descend in a jump pack on wings of fire. When you run, the ground shakes. Your sidearm is a miniature rocket launcher. Your chainsaw sword tears the enemies of the Emperor apart with whirling teeth. As you play, Death is your companion and ally, a trusted friend who brings doom to the Ork. When the enemy has the audacity to harm you, you do not hide and wait for your shield to recharge or your Larraman cells to heal you; you get in the enemy's face and kill them to heal yourself. Victory in the singleplayer campaign and in multiplayer Exterminatus mode is achieved by running toward whoever is shooting at you and taking them apart in a frenzied brawl. It is visceral. You, Captain, are a Space Marine. In the Emperor's name, let none survive.			",26,5,0,11,6,4,22

												This game is criminally underrated, and one of the greatest ""didn't sell enough to warrant a sequel"" tragedies I can think of. Action games rarely go all out when it comes to the sheer number of enemies you fight, and simplistic-yet-satisfying gameplay is hard to pull off but Space Marine does both incredibly well. The multiplayer is solid for what was probably an afterthought, but the single player campaign is superbly entertaining and packed with violence in the WH40K style.

												This game was pretty fun and was probably one of the better Warhammer games. It wasn't a game that Warhammer sold it's name on and the company took a dump on it. this game was pretty fun as a third person shooter with an indept story of deception and evil. the game's multiplayer is dead but that shouldn't stop you from pickign the game up for a great single player experience. It's not really worth getting all the dlc has some of it is for multiplayer but if you have a mate who has the game you can get skins, exclusive upgrades and new game modes to play for good fun. 7.5/10 Generally you slash orcs with swords and shoot them with bows well have fun doing that in this game cus ya don't.

I was so wrong. The game offers a great view how a casual day in the life of a space marine looks like. And the graphic is decent. The game runs on nearly all computers, and it's pretty easy to learn. If you wanna give warhammer games a try and you're not into RTS, buy this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Entertaining and fun the hours flew by as I stomped orcs and supernatural beings left and right. The more you play the better it gets due to fun upgrades and powerful weapons. The story's pace is a bit off and, while there are almost no breaks in between the fighting, the location and lore ooze out of every corner of the devastated world. The biggest drawbacks of the game however is the short lenght and linear level design.			",125,16,0,9,2,0,13

												I had a great time playing this game.  It was very gratifying and I felt pretty badass stomping around and exploding bad guys as an adeptus astartes.  story was surprisingly enjoyable, titus is a pretty cool dude.  looking forward to seeing what comes next! the 40K universe is totally awesome already, and this game delivers; short and sweet, brutal and overall plain old fun.

												Simply amazing. If you're 40k fan, the opportunity to play as a single character rather than at a tactical level (as we have so many times before) is brilliant. Combat is an unusual mix of third person shooter and frantic melee combat, which sounds odd in theory but really makes for a great experience.Yes, the campaign is a little short (a good couple of evenings play if you don't rush it), but the voice acting is first class and the story is memorable and true to its roots. Graphically rich and violent in its depiction of the waves of enemies you will righteously purge, it indulges 40k fans with one of the best depictions of the game universe I've yet played.After completing it I dabbled a bit with the multiplayer on Exterminatus mode, 4 players versus wave after wave of enemies or upto 8 man teams versus 8 other human players and that gives the game a bit of extra longetivity.Ultimately, its a game you will want to replay for the campaign or pvp blast. Enjoy it, finish it and then load it up it up again whenever you feel like purging xenos (or human opponents).***EDIT*** I want add the multiplayer is really good. You can play with others against waves of computer controlled enemies as I mentioned before or on two opposing teams of human player against each other. This adds another level of enjoyment.I would STRONGLY SUGGEST you play the co-op game mode ""Exterminatus"" first to get all the weapons unlocked. ""Versus"" mode is pretty unforgiving if you don't have access to the Weapons and Perks. Killing the cpu mobs is fun and reasonably easy. With practice I can now complete 2 and a half waves solo, although no doubt there are others who can do better. ***/EDIT***Finally, my recommendation.I picked up the game when it was on sale and frankly I wish I had done so sooner. Grab it whenever it's on sale and don't worry about the DLC, it's not necessary unless you want to look cool in multiplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very good third person shooter. It has an awesome single player game but sadly, the multiplayer is just too laggy since it lacks dedicated servers. The leveling system also makes it hard for newcomers to have a chance against people with countless more hours of gaming because those that played more are rewarded with superior weapons and weapon perks. If you got the money and the time for multiple games, buy it, otherwise better invest your time on some other game.			",335,97,7,47,60,5,84

												FOR THE EMPEROR!This game is, like my previous reviewer already said, around for around 5 years on steam. If you like 3rd person hack & slay kinda games with masses of enemies swarming you from every angle, and your only way to repell them is brute force, then this game is for you. Imagine a Post-human Soldier wielding a Chain Saw powered Blade (Chainsaw) or other Midevil weps. All this is placed though in the 41st Millenium. Humanity is forced to defend against threats from all sides. And the only hope for the Planet you embark on is YOU. So, enjoy your game experience and slay some orks .. and maybe other Xenos!

												A thoroughy enjoyable third-person action game with solid shooter mechanics and immensely satisfying melee combat, Space Marine puts you in the power armor of a captain of the Ultramarines... which makes you feel instantly beyond badass. The competitive online is horribly unbalanced and laggy, but the co-op exterminatus mode (horde mode) is just as enjoyable as the singleplayer. Being able to customize your own Space Marine for the multiplayer only adds value to it. Well worth grabbing, especially for Warhammer 40,000 fans.			",740,242,1,116,60,4,125

												Do yourself a favor: skip Eternal Crusade and get this game instead.   The weapons are fairly balanced, there are a couple that stand out as simpler to use but largely they've all been balanced to perfection.   The different styles offered have a rock, paper, scissor type mechanic which play off of each other very smoothly.  But not so much so that you feel like certain classes automatically beat others.  A skilled player can take all comers with any style no problem.   The animations are extremely smooth and it's managed to stand the test of time in terms of playability and replayability.  The multiplayer doesn't have the playerbase it used to, but this one is still definitely worth your time.   Plays GREAT with a controller or keyboard.  But if you've been looking for a game to utilize that USB controller that's been collecting dust on your shelf, this is a must have. It boils down to this:  smooth responsive gameplay,  tight controls and graphics which are still pretty damn polished.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fairly short, I got 12 hours out of it on hard, but pretty darn fun. It's controls feel weighty and satisfying, as do its guns, and the game does a great job making you feel like one of the Emperor's finest. It also does a great job capturing the scale of things in the 40k universe, which really impressed me. Biggest downside is the writing. It's probably the worst I've seen in a game. The conversations are basically trading just one-liners for the first 2/3rds of the game, and the characterization on the marines is just god-awful. But shoot, you're not playing this for the story, you're playing it to be a Space Marine!			",126,24,0,18,6,1,23

												A good action game full of lots of gratifying shoot ‘em up and cut ‘em to pieces cartoon violence.  The game is too short (I finished it in 11 hours) and there isn’t much going on besides the killin’.  The story is simplistic and a bit derivative (lots of Lord of the Rings references and level lifted straight from the films and re-hashed for the setting) but I had fun playing it.  I do wish it were longer and am disappointed that the sequels were cancelled before they were produced as I wanted to play more of it when I was done.  I do think it is over-priced for the amount of gameplay you actually get, especially since it is aging now, but if you see it on sale and like Warhammer I would recommend buying it.Don't bother with the DLC as it is almost useless execpt for multi-player and MP is all but dead now.

												Honestly, I really liked that game - gameplay felt smooth and art direction is absolutely fantastic. I actually liked how these bulky suits of SPEEEHS MEHREENS power armor looked like as well as weaponary.Still, the story felt quite short IMO and, once again, we have met our common enemy - cliffhanger. By the way, why did they change canonic character from WH40K universe with Titus? Or they are the one, but just have two names? I really hope, that one day Space Marine 2 will be released. I'm no fan of tabletop games or books. It were games that introduced me to this savage and bloody universe and it has to be developed further, more independently from outdated designs of GamesWorkshop canons. (cough-cough, Dawn of War 3 I'm talking to you... Damn your hypersex-looking Marines. Dawn of War 2 was way realistic and tactical - exactly how Space Marines gameplay should feel like)Multiplayer was a failure IMHO - no proper support, paid co-op and lack of diversity.Anyways, I'd strongly recommend to complete this game, if you're loyal to GOD EMPEROR. Otherwise - you're heretic dog awaiting for exterminatus.7.5/10			",140,37,2,21,3,2,15

It might not be mechanically unique, but if you crave for some third person ork chainswording and slamming the hammer of righteousness into the privates of Chaos in third person, the game is for you.

												Definately feels right. You're a badass space marine in the 41 millenium defending a forge world from an alien envasion. The orks, large ape-like green aliens that would make tolkien crap himself, weilding crude ranged and melee weapons. Oh and there's a twist plot twist... if you're familiar with the 40k universe you'll probably roll your eyes when it happens.You'll find yourself finding waves orks weilding various weapons, usually crude blades that engage in melee, which you can match with the iconic chainsword of the 40k universe. Oh ya, also a power axe and a thunder hammer, but really who cares?the consranged weapons feel a bit weak when you're fighting an ork charge. You'll likely only be able to kill 2 of them before they close on you when and you're forced in to melee combat... on the other hand... chainsword. So maybe not a con afterall?Multiplayer makes you feel way too fragile. As a shooter, not my thing, but as a 40k game just a bit unsatisfying to be a space marine and made of paper.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also it is basically just chaos and space marines although you do get to fight against Orks, shame the Orks races weren't integrated into their own game mode.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a fantastic game that has amazing gameplay and a decent story based on the 40K universe. Gameplay, though simplistic, is very satisfying and at times you truely feel like the powerhouse an Ultramarine Captain should be. The enemies are repetitive, but a constant stream of new weapons and upgrades keeps thing fun and interesting, though some weapons are far worse than others. Melee combat feels a bit weak most of the time, as you end up losing may more health than you would of it you stayed out of close range. However at times it's very energetic, cleaving through smaller enemies is fun and you'll find yourself trying to go toe-to-toe with the larger ones in close combat just for the satisfaction in it, though that usually ends up badly for it. The backgrounds look gorgeous and the scenery, though keeping the general concept of a ruined planet, still manages to change constantly enough to not bore you. Unfortunately, the biggest problem with this game is it's story. The story itself is based on the 40K universe and does a very good job showing the universe to the player... too good, sadly. Throughout the story you follow a character named Titus, a Captain of the Ultramarines. Around the halfway point of the game you come in contact with a source of pure warp energy and survive, your Legate pointing out how impossible that is. While this is brought up a couple of times thereafter, it's not until the end of the game where the full impact of this occurs. After defeating the big-bad and waking up to the sunset, an Inquisitor questions your connection to the forces of Chaos based on what the Legate had told him and he takes you into custody. As a fan of the universe, I know this is an immediate death setence, and Titus, the character you just spent the campaign getting to like, is essentially dead. While this is accurate to what would happen in the universe, it does not make for a satisying ending to a videogame and it really hurt my opinion of this game. Other than the ending, the story is strong, it ties in directly to your objectives and there are some good twists now and then. I strongly recommend this game if you're a fan of the universe, it respectfully represents the Space Marines, Orks, and even Chaos and Inquistion. This game truely feels like what it would be like to be in a Marine's Power Armor, a demi-god like yet heavily outnumbered champion. If you're not a fan of the universe the gameplay is still fun, but don't expect the story to make much sense to you, the developers didn't do a fantastic job explaining things to new fans.

												Outstanding. I went into this game expecting something very close to Gears of War. It's WAY MORE free flowing than GOW. The combat is gritty, visceral, and fast paced. The story is interesting and deep but not imposing. Simply put, this game is an obscene amount of fun. Here's a video of me reviewing it whilst giggling like an idiot:

												Fun game, fast paced with multiplayer matches up to 8vs8. The campaign were straight forward and the chaos invasion mission in exterminatus felt more challenging than the campaign. In the versus pvp you can almost always find atleast one game lobby up 24/7 with 6+ ppl. The pvp mode to search for is ""sieze ground"", other modes than that you would have to make an event for it to happen.The las cannon and melta gun have been quite irritating in mp, sometimes i think the game would have been better without them. The dedicated wikia seemed a bit thin on gameplay mechanic details, so youll need to ask around for tips to learn ""aspects"" of mp pvp.I havnt experienced super much lag in the pc matches, but plenty of ""migrating host""; pauses the game normally for seconds up to a minute or so. On occasion host migrations pauses for minutes or freezes the game and you rather restart the game.The game doesnt seem to be supported anymore, that could be the reason why cheaters are spotted regularly in mp. Cheats consist of having more than two perks activated at the same time, or impossible class-weapon combinations, ex: a tactical with chainsword or power maul. From what ive heard there seem to be a claim that these ""weapon bugs/ cheats"" could be just visual; that in some way people are able to change the visual display of a tactical knife to a chainsword instead.8/10 would play mp again with friends. I bought the game + dlc¨s in a bundle for 10,74€, and i dont think its worth more than that 2016.			",11,1,0,0,0,0,3

												A good action game full of lots of gratifying shoot ‘em up and cut ‘em to pieces cartoon violence.  The game is too short (I finished it in 11 hours) and there isn’t much going on besides the killin’.  The story is simplistic and a bit derivative (lots of Lord of the Rings references and level lifted straight from the films and re-hashed for the setting) but I had fun playing it.  I do wish it were longer and am disappointed that the sequels were cancelled before they were produced as I wanted to play more of it when I was done.  I do think it is over-priced for the amount of gameplay you actually get, especially since it is aging now, but if you see it on sale and like Warhammer I would recommend buying it.Don't bother with the DLC as it is almost useless execpt for multi-player and MP is all but dead now.

It nails so many of the things I love about 40K, gets the feel of it all completely right. The gameplay is great, if somewhat repetitive, and even though it is short the campaign is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing!

Sound is good, voice acting is good. There is also a multiplayer mode that is dead and unfortunately all the DLC is multiplayer related. Too bad none of that DLC was singleplayer content.

I would consider this game the equivalent, and modern day version of ""Contra"" or ""Super C"" on the Nintendo Entertainment System.I highly recommend this one, even at full price. Simply for the sheer fun and entertainment value you get out of this game.Despite all the repetitive enemies, the limited story direction (well... it is Warhammer 40K after all, amirite?), and the driven corridor clearing combat, it's still an exciting and sometimes challenging experience.I, however, wouldn't recommend any DLC unless you plan on playing online with a clan.

												   I sat down tonight and decided to take a look at some of the games in my Steam Library that I missed over the years. I saw this game and I remembered hearing that it was good a few years back. So I downloaded it and decided to boot it up.   5 hours later and I just finished one of the most well-paced and action packed campaigns I have ever played! Not only did I finish in one sitting, but I never got bored or looked at the time at any point throuhout this suprising experience. The gun-play mixed with the gory melee made for some of the most fun I've ever had killing enemies in a game. If you want to play a short game that thoroughly entertains you throughout pick this up!   The only negative I have really is that the ending is somewhat unsatisfactory and I saw the point the developers wanted to get across but it just wasn't enough. Other than that its worthy of the full asking price.9/10			",221,39,3,30,24,2,43

At present I have just about 548 hours on this game and have to say it's absolutely fantastic if you enjoy Warhammer 40,000 and can get over the occasional lag issues, you will also want to look into joining a clan or a group in order to play the game more frequently.The game's story is good, lengthy and an enjoyable slaughterfest of carnage in the Emperor's name, there has not and most likely may not be any game to come out in the near future that will allow you to wield as much power as you do in this game without being overpowered, you never feel that there's no chance of death and tactics are required even though you can cleave through your foe as though they were made of paper, the singleplayer also allows you to perform epic feats through the use of a slow-mo system called ""Focus"" that allows you to slow down time when in aim-down-sights mode and increase your melee damage by an incredible amount that allows you to cleave through boyz, nobz and meganobz with ease, the game does lose some of its touch when you finally get to the last few levels where you fight Chaos Space Marines, they are much harder to kill and do not feature any sort of gore which leaves a lot to be desired, but the game is pretty good overall even for just the singleplayer, It'll take you about 8 hours to beat if you play on normal, may vary depending on skill of course.Now. Onto the multiplayer, while it is a laggy pile of crap that often causes desyncs and frustration when people use ridiculously overpowered weapons, it is also bloody fantastic and one of the best and most easily accessible 40k games featuring the Adeptus Astartes to date, no game I've ever played allows you to feel this powerful whilst still being on equal standing with your enemies, you feel like an absolute beast of a man who can tear through an entire team given the right loadout and skill, I've personally gone on 20:0 (K:D) rampages with a stalker bolter with precision shooting in both long range and close combat, it's absolutely visceral and I love it. There are of course the issues of lag which cannot be ignored, every other game will lag worse than playing with Dial-up, remember downloading a 1 minute youtube video for about 8 minutes? that's basically what this multiplayer can be like, people warping around, instakilling you but taking no damage and even receiving no damage even though they stand still. It's very buggy and can get very frustrating but with a group to play with, it's absolutely amazing.Now, I wouldn't recommend buying this game at full price unless you're satisfied with the singleplayer content as the game's multiplayer is becoming less and less active with the upcoming release of Eternal Crusade, I'd say pick this game up on a sale if you can, play it and enjoy some multiplayer games if anyone is still playing but I'd recommend anyone who loves Warhammer 40,000 keeps an eye on Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade, it's an upcoming MMOTPS in the style of Planetside 2 set in the 40k universe, it's shaping up to be absolutely amazing and definitely a game people will want to pay attention to if they love the 40k universe as much as I do.

												Space Marines is great if you like killing stuff and of course... Warhammer! ^^ The Campaign is short but keeps you entertained. Be sure to grab it during a sale.Just keep in mind, the multiplayer is dead. The Lobby-System is aweful as well. I thought that I find more players in the DLC content but that is not the case. Dont bother buying them (Chaos Unleashed and Dreadnought).			",52,5,0,8,1,0,7

												Such a great game!  It's a lovingly crafted 3rd person shoot 'em / bash 'em up. As a space marine with a bolter and chainsword, you really feel like a one man army.  The combat is the star of the show with this title.  It's very satisfying to mow down a horde of orcs with your bolter and then dive into the fight with your chainsword to finish them off.The multiplayer is ""good"", but it gets old very fast.  It would be much better if there were more content and greater variety of modes.			",161,16,0,13,21,0,25

												I personally love this game, although it's online community is dead (I have never been able to find a game online so far) The single player campaign is strong. Great sound effects especially the heavy feel of your character. Bulky when walking but a whirlwind of death waiting to strike. Graphics are on par with what I'd expect for its release. Played it and completed it on Xbox 360 at the time of original release and I've bought it again solely for the single player and the chance to batter a green skin with my bare fists rather than watching it happen. 8/10			",52,3,0,10,11,0,13

												This game really takes you to the WH40K world.  The architecture you see in the game, when you run or leap down, you feel as if you weight A LOT, the music is precise and fit for an environment that doesn't promote musical arts (that's why the music is so cool). Also, you can at last realize how a Space Marine feels battling unending hordes. If you want a full WH40K experience, I cannot think of a better game than this one and, believe me, I played a lot of them.			",10,11,0,8,1,0,2

												One of the best Warhammer games available (along with Dawn of War), this game is unique amongst most Warhammer games in that it is  not turn based nor grand strategy, it is a 3rd person shooter similar to Gears of War in gameplay. With a great story, fun gameplay and grimdark world it is a perfect reflection of the Warhammer universe lore. I couldn't recommend this highly enough if you enjoy Warhammer or shooters. It isn't very long, perhaps 8-9 hours story, and the online has mostly migrated to Eternal Crusade now.			",202,22,5,35,11,1,32

												This is one of the best WH40k games ever made.  It plays very well and really captures the feeling of being a space marine in battle.  Assault, Tactical and Devestator marines are balanced very well, and each plays just perfectly according to its class.  If you like 40k - you'll absolutely love this game.			",7,0,0,5,2,0,10

												This is one of the best 3rd person Hack/Slash/Shootem games...period.  It is set in the extremely hostile and brutal Warhammer 40k universe.  Campaign on easy took me about  15 hours to complete and I died excessively.  Much to my enjoyment!  When you die in this game it is awesome because of the sheer scale and volume of Orks that come at you!  There are 3 unique perks/classes to choose from and about a dozen or so classic WH40K weapons like the Chainsword, Bolter, Melta Gun, etc.  In campaign mode there is nothing more satisfying than using a stun attack and then EXECUTING an Ork in a brutal and melee kind of way to REGAIN HEALTH! In multiplayer you get wave after wave of Xeno madness in Exterminatus! I absolutely recommend this game!  I purchased the Chaos Expansion and really enjoy it as well.  This game plays like watching the movie 300...slow mow, blood constantly splattering and flowing over everything, and brutal melee combat that just does not stop! A++			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well FINALLY! A decent take on a FPS Warhammer 40K! It looks great, feels great, moves great and is (depending on difficulty and/or single/multi-player game selection) as easy and/or hard as to be... - You guessed it: great!The Story is simple and deep at the same time. Lots of shout-outs to the lore and the board game. There's a few things missing, but I'm gonna forgive it, simply because I understand the Devs' problem that they had to keep it all progressive and over-the-course-of-the-game-like. The graphics are so blocky and ugly that they're stunning. (Warhammer 40k fans will get what that means.)The enemies and combat is in-your-face gory and brutal, as it should be in the deep dark universe of Warhammer 40k.The Arsenal of Weapons is not only cool, it stays true to the lore... The characters work incredibly well, and grow juuuust enough during the game that you're feelling bummed when it's all over. (SEQUEL!!! - I doubt it, but, I, for one, would welcome it.)Right... So, down to cases.Pros: 5/7 - Nice, simple, deep, developing, engaging storyline; decent, believable characters (I know you're hoping for more, Devs, but let's be honest. This is Warhammer 40k. Even decent and believable are BIG words of praise for story purposes.) ; Graphics are as they should be. Not pretty, but stunning in their dark, blocky, vast, gritty ugliness; Good Funfactor is excellent. Stomping, Chopping and Shooting Orks and Chaos Marines is SOOO much more fun than it sounds. And It actually gets harder and more fun in multiplayer once you take the time to get into it; Very Nice Replayabillity, (there's ton's of difference between single-and-multi-player-games, and the difference in difficulty settings-vs-feel in the campaign is visible enough that it makes several consecutive playthroughs viable.)Cons: 2/7 The money-maker, unfortunately, is in effect in the multiplayer. (Look Devs, as much as I applaud you wanting to provide assistance to those unfortunate few who don't have the time, talent, skill, or dedication to ""earn"" the assorted skins, weapons, gadgets and-what-not, BUT do have REAL money they're willing to trade you to GIVE it to them isn't really endearing you to the rest of us, who like a challenge, who like to play and rank up and stuff. I understand you're running a business, I really do, but it's discouraging and more likely than not to make me quit the multiplayer than not.) ; Things are a liiiitle repetitious. The variation in topography and architecture makes it less obvious, and the progression in the singleplayer campaign to bigger, badder, better trained-and-equipped-enemies is all well and good, but while it IS fun to ""SMITE THE INFIDELS"" ""FOR THE EMPEROR!"" and all that, I'm not gonna lie. Sooner, rather than later, it'll get old. Thankfully there's tons of content and good ground for replayabillity here, but given the fact that competitors are already vying for top FPS spot in the Warhammer (40k and otherwise) theme, the Devs might wanna consider upping the ante on this title. Soon. More content... More Factions, (Guardsmen, Eldar, Tyranids?) maps, an expansion, whatever... - Theres room to grow here, people, and you know it.(Oh. Incident'ly... I'm gonna go ahead and ask where the ""Powers"" are, in the game. You know... Psychers or whatever they were called in the boardgame... Every faction had them, more or less... They would probably rock the Multiplayer if you balanced them right... Just saying.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Surprisingly entertaining game. The story is rather predictable but fits very nicely into the Warhammer 40k universe. Characters are stereotypical as hell, but that's what W40k is like. Combat is pretty intense, extremely bloody and really almost comically exaggerated in its violence, again fitting perfectly into the Warhammer 40k aesthetic. Guns feel pretty great sound effects are majorly really convincing. The interacton between ranged and melee combat is very good since both are rather well balanced and both are fun. Want some pretty mindless action with 6-7 hours of quasi non-stop banging action set in a dark gothic far future universe with Space Marines in huge and clunky armor and as green as stupid SPACE ORKS(!!!)? This is your game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had a rough time saying this is good rather than bad because I didn't really care for it but it's good, hard and brutalizing, you hardly go a minute without seeing a horde of orks run at you just to die; the singleplayer campaign lasts for about 8ish hours and multiplayer is pretty good with COOP survival mode and versus mode.

												I personally love this game, although it's online community is dead (I have never been able to find a game online so far) The single player campaign is strong. Great sound effects especially the heavy feel of your character. Bulky when walking but a whirlwind of death waiting to strike. Graphics are on par with what I'd expect for its release. Played it and completed it on Xbox 360 at the time of original release and I've bought it again solely for the single player and the chance to batter a green skin with my bare fists rather than watching it happen. 8/10			",52,3,0,10,11,0,13

												This game really takes you to the WH40K world.  The architecture you see in the game, when you run or leap down, you feel as if you weight A LOT, the music is precise and fit for an environment that doesn't promote musical arts (that's why the music is so cool). Also, you can at last realize how a Space Marine feels battling unending hordes. If you want a full WH40K experience, I cannot think of a better game than this one and, believe me, I played a lot of them.			",10,11,0,8,1,0,2

												One of the best Warhammer games available (along with Dawn of War), this game is unique amongst most Warhammer games in that it is  not turn based nor grand strategy, it is a 3rd person shooter similar to Gears of War in gameplay. With a great story, fun gameplay and grimdark world it is a perfect reflection of the Warhammer universe lore. I couldn't recommend this highly enough if you enjoy Warhammer or shooters. It isn't very long, perhaps 8-9 hours story, and the online has mostly migrated to Eternal Crusade now.			",202,22,5,35,11,1,32

												Decent game. The single-player part is a bit boring at times, where you're just walking around, doing nothing. There are also a lot of lifts, with no real function. I think they're there to increase the playtime. Also, I wish there was more variation in environments. About 90% of the game you're inside a building. The shootouts and close combat are satisfying, but can become frustrating. And the reason for that is when you're executing an enemy, you're still open to enemy fire. So while an execution should increase your health again, most of the times it doesn't even help or even gets worse, resulting in too many deaths. And... well, there aren't too many bossfights. I think there are only 2-3. Disappointing.The graphics are sharp, and the voice acting is brilliant (Mark Strong !) though. But this game could've been so much more. Wait for a pricedrop before buying, unless you're into decent games, of course. (The multiplayer is supposed to be fun though, but I've yet to try it.)[Rating: 78/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Play as Captain Titus in this gory third-person-shooter version of the 40k universe (with pretty much no racial/chapter diversity), a battle-hardened Ultramarine who has no idea how to jump over 2-foot ledges or direct instructions. Although some of the game's functions may not work as well as the devs might've hoped, it still delivers hardcore killing-action without any delay (sometimes it gets annoying, but what can you do? Stop crying). Surprisingly similar melee weapons give you many opportunities to pulverise, slash and pound your enemies with; so you'll certainly have your fair share of blood and gore (or don't, and just hoard ammo,  hang back and be the kind of captain that says: ""No, you guys go ahead into the fight. I'll stay back here and cover you with my little bolt pistol that conveniently has infinite ammo""). And even when you finish the campaign (Which is a challenging go-here-and-hit-these-things type story on it's own) you can go head to head with the other 4 or 5 players that still play the multiplayer feature, or form a team with up to 3 other players and take on 21 repetitive waves of overpowered enemies in the slightly more popular and less broken exterminatus mode. If you're the sort of person that wants a FPS version of DoW, this is it.Note: Hard mode is pretty easyAlright, we're done here.			",115,7,0,10,10,0,6

												Reading some reviews on steam and russian playground.ru, i was a bit disappointed about this game. There were mentioned some mistakes of the developers, concerning behaviour and wearings of the Adeptus Astartes. Never the less, i made up my mind to buy Space Marine. And you know... that was perfect, despite of some mistakes. What about its ""minuses"" - 1) Its russian dubbing is badly done in some phrases of the main character - sometimes it sounds too indifferent. That irritated me a bit. 2) Meltagun in the game is a kind of shotgun which shoots a cloud of gas, though it releases just a stream, that melts a tank - in cooperation mod it can't humiliate a marine within a shot. 3) Yes, there are some appearance mistakes, which contradicts with the Codex. These are minor mistakes, so if you are not acquainted with precise details of Warhammer ""lifestyle"", the game will be perfect for playing either in the campaign mode or the coop. Well, ""the pluses"" - 1) The Ultramarines kill dozens of orcs and heretics. What can be better? 2) Good storyline, i can say it is perfect. Good job. You just should play for a better understanding of its plot. 3) A good cooperation mod, where you can find at least one game. It is good for all the rest Warhammer games, where you have to wait your turn for an hour, 'cause there are no players. 4) Despite of some mistakes, which i described in minuses, the reference to the Warhammer back can be seen here, especially if you know it. The main hero reprimands his subject in narrow interpretation of the Codex and that leads to his departure in the inquisitor's ship. That point leads to forgotten II and XI legions of Adeptus Astartes, forgotten and deleted from Imperial archives. The Ultramarines (as known from some books of Warhammer Horus Heresy) became the biggest legion, just as mainly they were those who recruited marines from these two legions. These marines have one distinctive feature - often they act as they want, not looking into the Codex, while ""real"" Ultramarines can't but follow it in their belief that no one can be more educated in military science than the Imperator and their Robute Guilliman. This fact points out, that the main character is one of these recruited marines. That fact makes the plot clear and answers everything, concerning this matter. My opinion: don't be afraid to play this game.			",48,1,1,6,1,0,6

Simply for the sheer fun and entertainment value you get out of this game.Despite all the repetitive enemies, the limited story direction (well... it is Warhammer 40K after all, amirite?), and the driven corridor clearing combat, it's still an exciting and sometimes challenging experience.I, however, wouldn't recommend any DLC unless you plan on playing online with a clan.

												I'm quite surprised how amazing this game is.The single player was one hell of a ride. Extremely enjoyable ride. Ride full of slashing limbs and making big holes in torsos and vaporizing hundreds and thousands (definitely thousands) of green skins and heretics.The combat mechanics are nothing new, but they are well polished and the killing enemies is satisfactory. The melee fighting in large groups of foes could take some work because your character starts to stutter when he is being hit from every possible side and angle. But it's still better than being surrounded by group of enemies and being attacked only by one at a time (ehm ehm AC ehm ehm). Shooting experience is also really good, as is the feeling of watching explosion of blood after a bolt from your weapon penetrates the body of your target. The execution mode which regenerates health by finishing enemies has nice range of incredibly good looking animations.The weapon progression is slow but steady. You have 4 different melee weapons and 10 ranged weapons at your disposal. Through out the game you'll find fury seals (something like a berserker mode) which will upgrade your ability. But only with something incremental as longer fury time, or regenerating HP by inflicting damage. Those are nice things to have, but there could be something more interesting gameplay wise. The steady progression comes to a halt few chapters before the end of the game, which is kinda sad. There are also few instances where you have a jetpack, whit which you can propel yourself up into the air, find a group of foes and fall down on them dealing massive damage, stunning them and looking at the awesome shockwave.The level design isn't anything special or even good. It's a corridor with a lot of curves and vertical traverses. But even though  it isn't great from gameplay point of view, the game has an amazing atmosphere. I love postapo and I could feel it everywhere I've went. It was awesome, the heavy feeling that this world is doomed and that there is no hope for civilians. And that I'm here to help however I can, fighting ""alone"" against the never ending hordes. This is nicely complemented by a atmospheric soundtrack. The story isn't something special, it's your generic shooter story with a villain and wanna be twist waiting for you somewhere. But I would say that for a WH40k fan it has to be really enjoyable. It's a game that is suppose to be pure fun and relax, not something to think about, so I don't see a problem with the story line. The only weak point was the final boss fight which was a dull sequence of the same QTEs over and over again.There isn't anyone in the multi player right now which is sad. Because when I've played it with friends few years ago it was great fun. There are some basic modes like versus (team against team) or you can play some parts of the story (I don't think it's the whole story, but I can't remember) with a group of friends.My conclusion is that it's a great entertaining game, pure fun from killing thousands of enemies and I can recommend it to everyone.8.7/10 (I like the number 7)			",315,71,4,104,21,1,66

												Rating: 5/10Budget: I dunno...Replayability: LowLength: UnknownWarhammer is great. Warhammer 40K is great too. Warhammer PC games are generally something that tends to leave something desired, but maybe that is just my personal opinion. This old wargame has been reinvented so many times now, that it's actually very difficult to keep up with. This installment is a ""hack-and-slash"" where you play as an ultramarine. The first 5 minutes of the game made it clear that it was NOT a game I would enjoy. I initially see absoloutely nothing wrong with it however! It's generally just not the kind of game I'm into. If I am to say something positive about the game, the voice acting seems sound, for a hack-and-slash, the game seems well made, the graphics aren't exactly good - but it's an older game by now. Usual repetitiveness of the average hack-and-slash. Requires a bit of Warhammer 40k background knowledge to fully grasp. Probably nothing an hour on a wikipage will not fix. I can't really be one to critize this game, as it's not by genre. I'm not a hater, so I recommend reading some other reviews from people who might be more enthusiastic about this genre of game - that is if you yourself are into this type of game.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brutal simply put brutality at its finest. The Warhammer world is already filled with great story lines and the Space Marines are no exception. In this game you follow Captain Titus and his team and carve your way through thousands upon thousands of Orks in this master piece of a third person shooter/brawling title. The game features a variety of weapons all are very gratifing to use from the starting gun, the bolt pistol, to some of the more classifed weapons such as the vengence launcher. Each weapon has its own kick and sounds like your firing a truly elite weapon each and every single round. The game's melee combat is just as exception as its ranged combat I dare say its even better. From a dagger to a chain saw sword, and a massive hammer the game also features a varity of melee weapons that suit many different play styles all feel great to use and the melee movement and fluidty are astounding. For War hammer fans this game is a must. If your just a fan of smashing little green monsters with giant weapons and guns this game is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun third person 40K shooter. Captivates the universe very well. If you love all 40K things, this is the game for you hands down.Campaign is pretty fun, an ok story, but a bit repettitive. Multiplayer fixes this with working with a 4 man squad to defeat waves of the Ork and Chaos Hordes, and also about 8 vs 8 competitive matches.Costomizing your Space Marine is really fun as well. Black Templars ftw!			",41,5,0,5,21,0,30

												Rating: 5/10Budget: I dunno...Replayability: LowLength: UnknownWarhammer is great. Warhammer 40K is great too. Warhammer PC games are generally something that tends to leave something desired, but maybe that is just my personal opinion. This old wargame has been reinvented so many times now, that it's actually very difficult to keep up with. This installment is a ""hack-and-slash"" where you play as an ultramarine. The first 5 minutes of the game made it clear that it was NOT a game I would enjoy. I initially see absoloutely nothing wrong with it however! It's generally just not the kind of game I'm into. If I am to say something positive about the game, the voice acting seems sound, for a hack-and-slash, the game seems well made, the graphics aren't exactly good - but it's an older game by now. Usual repetitiveness of the average hack-and-slash. Requires a bit of Warhammer 40k background knowledge to fully grasp. Probably nothing an hour on a wikipage will not fix. I can't really be one to critize this game, as it's not by genre. I'm not a hater, so I recommend reading some other reviews from people who might be more enthusiastic about this genre of game - that is if you yourself are into this type of game.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fast paced gameplay that stagnates as the game goes on, insane difficulty curves, poor writing and a predictable plot, and the game ends with a QTE boss battle, after all the build up to an epic battle it ends with a QTE. Also, the game is only about 6 hours long. I would only recommend this game if you happen to see it on sale for very cheap. If this were not a warhammer game, it would have been torn apart by fans and critics.			",66,2,0,9,5,0,20

												Amazing game. Honestly, it is very tough to say a game is perfect, but this gets very close. TL;DR @ bottom.Pros:+Pretty up to date textures+Nice amount of weapons that you can choose from+Smooth controls (I would recommend a gamepad if you have one, although M&Key is OK.)+Pretty great soundtrack++Amazing voice work+++One of your Ultramarines looks like Anthony Hopkins+Decently long game+Plenty of multiplayer contentCons:-Due to THQ going bankrupt, there will be no sequel to this *planned* trilogy. (Ends on insanely annoying cliffhanger) -The online playerbase is a bunch of elitist neck-beards that hate new players-Even on the hardest difficulty, the game was still pretty simpleThis game is all around pretty solid for 29.99. For all the DLC as well, it is 59.99, and completley NOT worth it. Pick this up on a sale, and get the full collection if you really enjoy multiplayer. This game definitley requires that you join a group to have fun with multiplayer. If you've wanted to get into Warhammer 40,000, I'd say this is one of the CHEAPEST ways to do so and enjoy it. This is just scraping the surface of the Lore 40k has to offer. I honestly recommend this to anyone looking for a good 3PS. tl;dr:Great 3rd Person Shooter, feels a bit like GoW with less clunkly movement. Game is stupid difficult without a built in 'cover' function, but still very fun. Pick it up on a sale, and only get DLC if you like multiplayer games.			",476,72,3,46,25,1,50

												I never thought it possible, but these developers managed to turn Chainsaw Sword-wielding Space Marines into boredom - quite a remarkable feat.This title brings nothing new to anything; rather it detracts good stuff from titles many years before it. It feels like playing a very inferior clone of Gears of War - yes, the first one that came out on the original Xbox so many years ago.Suffering from severe consolitis, your character model controls like a tank stuck in syrup while covering roughly a third of your screen at all times. It also has a ""sprint"" feature controlling like a runaway dragracing car, bumping into objects and disrupting your movement flow.The combat is horrible; combos are repetive mash-button-travesties, and if you do mess up it's because your Space Marine tries to grab the Orc standing right next to the one you stunned - thus you die to BS that is no fault of yours. And to my biggest surprise - this game has grenades so boring I keep forgetting to use them - it's just a flashing red light with a patheticly poor pop at the end of it. Even the guns don't feel meaty or well done, they have that terrible plastic toy gun feel and sound to them.Not to mention it has the gruesome save points we all love to hate, destroying your progress many times over during the game, forcing you to repeat certain sections again and again, ad nauseum.The stages merely consists of bricks, bricks and more bricks, with a ghastly epitomizing color palette of grey, brown, and greyish-brown. It's excrutiatingly tedious on the eyes and one wonders if the artists were color blind or just forgot about other colors in the spectrum.Audio logs has some of the worst and most unspired VAs I've ever encountered and the story is stupid hogwash drivel that brings the game to ruin even faster. The game also have those insultingly boring ""puzzles"" where you press a button to make your character push a barrel or whatever else on some rails, and it drives the final nail in the coffin for this steaming pile of mediocre garbage.This really isn't worth your money, even on a sale, even in a dollar bundle. They took a huge dump on everything cool about the 40k universe and should be ashamed of it. You'll be bored to death playing it, and it's only because of my sunk cost fallacy I'm even bothering trying to finish the ugly MF. Support some indie game instead, because this so-called AAA game is just a poorly designed trap for your hard earned money. Wait for the reviews on 40k: Deathwing instead, and remember as always - NEVER preorder.			",550,160,25,59,40,1,76

												It's obvious that Relic and THQ didn't learn any lessons from ""Dawn of War 2"". ""Space Marine"" has all the same issues - for the campaign, the AI is simplistic and doesn't scale with difficulty; adding in more health and damage is just the cheap and easy way of making things tougher. For multiplayer, the problems are too numerous to mention, but we begin with the horrible lag issues. Many weapons used in multiplayer are extremely counter-intuitive and broken, most egregiously the plasma cannon. There are also constant issues with terrain collision and inconsistencies with executions. (Captain Titus saws orks brutally in half, for example... with the flat edge of the chainsword.)The few good things to say about ""Space Marine"" overall are that they captured the FEEL of being an Adeptus Astartes very, very well. They also kept to the lore as best they could, which isn't easy when the stated goal was to make the game accessible to non-fans of the Warhammer 40K universe. Overall, a 5/10.

												A beautiful, beautiful game, tons of blood, guts and screams of pain.While gameplay might be a bit repeatative, its VERY VERY enjoyable.You are a Space Marine, a walking tank, and the game makes you feel like that.Your most basic weapon is the Bolter, a .75 cal assault rifle, basically a 20mm cannon.Your second most basic weapon is the Chainsword, simply a chainsaw sword, the best weapon you can get, it spits blood all around, and has the most fun and brutal executions.There is no cowering in fear from enemies, there is no taking cover behind objects, there is no regenerating health.You only have a health regen ability which is recharged by killing more enemies, while activated you are close to invincible.To regenerate health in a different way you need to execute enemies, first stun them and then massacre them in a bloody and beautiful way.I give it 0/10 because it has no sequel >:(But seriously its 9/10, id give 10/10 but its multiplayer its almost impossible to play  because of a very low amount of players. (its hard to find a single match)			",189,12,6,25,21,1,47

												The Campaign is pretty fun, and decent for any fan of 40k. The multiplayer however is pretty terrible. There are only a few people playing, and beginners are thrown straight in with players already at the highest level. Given that the weapons unllocked at higher levels are far superior, any inexperienced player will be facing strings of games with one, maybe two kills, and deaths in the double figures. Put simply, if you want a decent 40k multiplayer game, probably go somewhere else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not worth buying at full price (which currently is $30), because:- Very Shallow (no upgrade system, no exploration, very simple barebones combat system where you can't even get in cover and combos are pretty much button mashing and very awkward)- Repetive and linear in a bad way (literally go from point A to B, killing the boring variety of enemies over and over again)- Controls (on controller, didnt try KB+M) feel sluggish and awkward. This issue becomes very apparent when trying to execute enemies for health- Frustrating (there are difficulty spikes and controls/ combat system makes it worse. For example the only way you get health back is by executing enemies, however there is a long animation process that takes place while executing, and you can get killed during sequence, like WTF!)Other than that, its just a mindless simple, medicore game. Not worth the full price, but its ok for a sale purchase			",183,11,2,21,18,1,15

												FOR THE EMPEROR!  Xeno scum and vile daemons shall die before your blade and bolter!Welcome to Irreverend Opinions As we take on Warhammer 40k Space Marine.The BlurbAn imperial forge-world, where machines of war are made, has been invaded by the Ork scum, and it falls on the shoulders of you, a heroic space marine captain, to slaughter them all and save the day.  But wait!  Chaos!First person linear story shooter, with a multiplayer extension.The GoodThe campaign is both fun and involving, no matter if you're familiar to the setting or not.  The story carries a couple of predictable twists, but also a couple of unpredictable ones also, with a bitter ending after victory has settled.  A worthwhile multiplayer experience lets you continue the enjoyment after the game has been completed.The weapons are simple to master for most part, and enemies are both varied and run with a decent AI.  The graphics are very high-standard, from environmental detail to droplets and giblets as you stomp on an orc's head, to smoke coming off the weapon.  Sound quality is quite well-rounded, giving in-game speech without being too overwhelming, and without drowning the player in explosion noises.A very polished piece of work.The BadWhoa, railway much.  The whole game is a corridor shooter.  You can tell that this is simply because of the storyline, which makes up for the fact, but if you want to have a free-roaming sandbox, or even a bit of elbow room, then you'll be left wanting unfortunately.The UglyThe final boss battle is purely QTE.  Really, guys?  Stop doing this.No, really.  Stop it.SuggestionsCan't say much here, with the game this finished.  The core complaints I have are the nature of the game, which cannot be altered without breaking it; and the ending, which honestly I doubt the developers will find worth their time to alter.  If I had my way, I would encourage the ending being shifted to be more inclined to a shooter battle - which is what the game actually functions as, last I checked.The Summary8/10, worth holding onto after the campaign because the multiplayer is enjoyable.  Fun shooter game, if a little restricted, but the story makes up for it.---If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group ",257,50,5,55,32,2,70

												introduction:I have mixed feelings about this title. Note that I played only SP campagin. the hook:On each level you have to fight through a linear map i.e. get from point A to B with only one possible route with boss at the end. Inbetween some maps you will have something to break the monotony (minigames), like shooting down planes, etc. gameplay:Overall, the gameplay is fun, splashing orks head, or fixing his teeth with a chansword was much more fun than I expected. That being said, there are some things I didnt like.- The moves are ridiculouslly simple to perform. This trivialized button combinations are a slap to the face of classic walking-fighting games you could encounter in the 90's.- As a fan of the WH40k lore, I have to say that the arcade'y gamestyle ruined the atmosphere for me. the game lacks the heavy, dark atmosphere that the books/short stories have, so you might reconsider, If that's what you're expecting (example: automatic healing, 'immortal' AI teammates).summary:The game is OK, the story is a little clichee (but I enjoyed it), so are the characters, gameplay is fun, but simple, it does not have much replay value to me. Some people might find this game awesome, but I cannot recommend this game to any random bloke without a word of warning. recommendation:This game deserves a third kind of rating, 'MEH', but since there is none, I give thumbs down, replayability being the main factor.

												THQ deserves to keep the Warhammer 40k ip.The big question I always ask myself when I play a video game adaptation of something is ""do I feel like"".Lately alot of comic and movie adaptations seem to fail at this quite frequently (go play Thor or Green Lantern and get back to me) and in the past alot of great i.p's or franchices have been butchered in the video game department.Not since Arkum Asylum have I felt so much like the central character , and been so immersed in a familiar world. So in answer to the question in my opening statement...I FEEL LIKE A MUTHAF@#*IN SPACE MARINE WHEN I PLAY THIS GAME!Wading into a horde of orcs with chainsword in one hand bolter in the other, I loved the seemless switching between mele and ranged combat. Controls are amazing , the single player is a work of art, and the multiplayer is a blast! Only thing missing is dedicated servers and this game would have gotten a 10/10 from me but without it gets a 9.75/10			",488,97,11,36,33,6,68

												I bought this game for $10 because i loved the Warhammer 40K series. Warhammer made great Dawn Of Wars in RTS modes but when i saw it in third person shooter i was thinking what the ♥♥♥♥? When i took a closer look i saw Games Workshop + THQ. Now that blew my mind. I loved Games Workshop's games and THQ's games so i imediately bought it and played it.Firstly, the campaign is extraordinary with sublime graphics. The cutscenes had fine graphics and the gameplay was awesome! I could not believe how well developed the questline was. Just like Darksiders 2, there is fast gameplay in the campaign where you start off with a chainsaw and a bolt pistol. Then you start cutting all the bloody orks up and Captain Titus does not give a ♥♥♥♥! Next, throughout the campaign, you develop better weapons and a special skill as well which allows you to restore health. New melee weapons such as the Power Axe and the Power Hammer is unlocked. Some levels even allow you to equip a jetpack! When wielding the Power Hammer and flying on a jetpack, the combos and skills combined are absolutely magnificent. Smashing up Ork boyz and beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of ♥♥♥♥tards who get in your way! When combos are used correctly, you are unstoppable. Through out the game you also discover weapons such as sniper rifles, laser snipers, heavy bolters, plasma pistols, plasma bolters, grenade launchers and lots more! Later in the chapters, the chaos demons and the chaos space marines appear from a portal after Captain Titus was used as pawns by the Chaos lord. Now havoc wrecks the place and Captain Titus has to save the world with his two companions. In the campaign there are 17 chapters! Each chapter last about 15-45 minutes (depending on difficulty and your skill level). After the campaign there is an epic epilogue to it but, we aren't finished yet.After finishing the campgain there is an online option! In the online section there are 4 main different types of games. Versus, Versus Private, Exterminatus and Exterminatus Private. Versus is basically PVP where you can choose between lots of modes such as capture the point, team deathmatch, free for all, capture the flag and seize ground. The versus servers are still really active filled with players. Versus private is basically versus except it is only for friends and solo. Exterminatus is the co-op survival mode. You can play with 2-4 players on 4 different types of maps. After every 5 rounds you switch to a different map but with harder monsters. In Exterminatus you kill Orks. On the last wave (bonus wave), stage 21, chaos demons and chaos space marines invade you and you must kill them all to win. Exterminatus private is basically exterminatus but with friends/solo only. In multiplayer mode there are 41 levels in total. When you reach level 4 you obtain a place where you can customize you space marine/chaos space marine. When you progress through each level you can unlock more gear, weapons and perks. Armour can be unlocked by finishing really hard challenges or you could buy custom ones from the steam DLC shop for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. In multiplayer there are 3 types of main roles: Tactical: Carries a default bolter and a deafult chainsawDevastator: Carries a default pistol and a deafult heavy bolterAssault: Carries a default pistol and a defaul chainsawThe tactical is the support. The devastator is the tank and the Assault is the damage per second. The assault usually wields power axes and power hammers or it can wield relic items from the DLC.This is one of my favourite Warhammer 40,000 games. Games Workshop already makes great RTS and THQ makes great bloody third person gamers such as Darksiders II. If you are a Warhammer 40,000 fanboy, love THQ games, love Games Workshop games, love Darksiders II or if you love thrid person shooters/third person games then you HAVE to buy this game. DO NOT wait any longer buy it now! The only thing that's stopping you is the price -_- Although it is slightly over priced ($39.99) you might want to wait a while until it's about 50%-75%. Stunning graphics, unbelievable gameplay, good multiplayer, great features and epic weapons and classes! MUST PUT ON YOUR CHRISTMAS WISHLIST FOR 2015!!! DON'T LISTEN TO THE ♥♥♥♥ED UP NEGATIVE REVIEWS! BUY THIS GAME NOW9/10Chop2015			",96,9,2,7,4,2,15

												FOR THE EMPEROR!If you like the following things you will like this game:(1) Space Marines(2) Chainswords(3) Orks and Chaos Marines dying(4) Smashing and stompingIn all seriousness, I think most criticisms I have seen of this game involve it having a short campaign (Eh, who cares? It's story-driven and it's very satisfying) and a lot of DLC (Yes yes....I don't like it either). But the GAME itself is gooooood, like, good good. The MP is fun (though the versus is very competitive). The co-op wave mode is awesome, though I don't know how many people play now.If the game is on sale for $15 or less, do it.

												I just finished the game, and I must validate the claim that Space Marine is one of the greatest games you've never heard anyone talk about, or know anyone who has played it.I've read reviews on this game before buying it on sale, and I must say that the negative critiques were nothing more than nitpicking. The only major flaw this game suffers from is stupid ally AI that will walk around in the open, take fire, and not return it. A great resolution to this would have been online co-op, but sadly there's no singleplayer co-op.I just want to point out that Space Marine is the first game in what was supposed to be a trilogy, but things happened, companies went extinct, and there may never be any sequels. With that said, the ending ends on somewhat of a clif-hanger leading up to the next game. However, don't let that stop you from experiencing one of the best & most fun games I've played in a long time. You will indeed feel like a bad @$$.			",264,69,2,23,15,3,35

												As a true fan of 40K I can say I will never pick this game up again to play at any point. The failure to find a sweet spot for game play turns this sour early & stays sour. As a button masher this isn't the worst I have ever played but it forces you to close the range gap to heal your self in close combat with stuns & then death blows, that fails to work when you are getting shot at & have a mob of over 10 orc's around you. The shinny did hit the mark with the feel & story that is 40k but if you cant enjoy the game at all I don't see how that could raise the mark at all. The more I played this game the more I just hated it, you don't feel like a space marine you feel weak & frail not a gene altered human that's 8 ft tall in armor & that has been trained to handle every thing. One of the major problems just comes from the play balance having 360 combat all targeting the player with shooting raining down & no way to get healed but to stay in the melee mix just fails as it drags out every combat & makes the next combat worse if you didn't get healed & remember you still have to run to the shooters to kill them or just get chipped away as you shoot back & don't get healed, the game really just felt like pulling teeth after some levels. This is the fan in me that cant let this one go the bolter is a gyrojet rifle (look it up its a real weapon) not a machingun & it just makes the space marine so much less, a bolter is for a skilled fighter one shot = one kill the machingun is for some one who cant shoot & needs 20 shots to hit...

												Singleplayer is fun, in a mindless kind of way, but satisfiying because of the accuracy in the portrayal of Space Marines from the 40k universe in that they are pretty much walking tanks with shield generators. The sad thing is, multiplayer is pure cancer. Singleplayer creates this notion of near invincibilty of your character through a healing mechanism to regenerate either by sitting around waiting, or by the stomping of greenskins. Well, in multiplayer, all you do is the former.     Each engagement feels like you will die, and in most cases you do. Which isn't too bad, but being that many of the modes ask you to be in the thick of combat to win, waiting over ten seconds to spawn or spawn at your base that could be quite a far walk from said thick, becomes very, very annoying. Yes, there is a perk that will bring this down to a couple of seconds, but sometimes that slot could be used for something more useful. Like protection for Tazmanian Devils with Jumppacks and chainsaw swords...     The couple of issues I have with this game online stems from the fact that no proper balancing was ever done. As you rank up winning rounds and killing Heretics, (or non-believers), weapons, armor cosmetics, and class perks become available. Challenges were also included to add some reward for doing such things as kills, kill-streaks, or multikills. But this isn't only restricted to exp toward your level, this also includes weapons perks. The things is, when host has advantage, as well as the many others that have near-perfect connection with them, the game becomes unbearable to play. Killing a single enemy is like perdicting the future in milliseconds. Each action must be made thinking that someone will move into celestial alignment with your sights, granting you access to the heavens and their many gifts thinking once you earn that weapon's perk for completing a specific challenge, you could finally start competing on an equal footing.     Not so much.     Unfortunatly, the god's were unforgiving. THQ was striken down before any balancing could be made. Oh, yeah and hacks are there. Go figure. Just giving you fair warning. Don't expect a lot out of this game multiplayer-wise.			",128,13,0,6,3,0,4

												A good game.  The single player campaign is very well made, and the whole aesthetic matches the 40k 'verse to a T.  The multiplayer is a mixed bag.  I don't do pvp much, but you can do 1 v 1 private match to gain all the perks you want so that balances.  The Co-op multiplayer is good - Exterminatus is very fun, but you need 4 people.  At present, the multiplayer pool is essentially dead.  The only way to do co-op or vs in Space Marine is to meet up with one of the dedicated 40k gaming groups (of which there are a good number) and schedule with them, or to have personal friends to play with.  PUG grouping is non-existant nowadays. ",277,32,1,36,25,4,64

												A simple and well rounded third person shooter which while it isnt anything mind blowing it certinly is a fun experince. The story is such you are captin titus of the ultra marines and are sent down on an ork infested planet and your objective is to rid the planet of them it is simple enough. Game play wise it is a third person shooter which decides to forgo cover and just makes use of the space marines overall resistance to bullets. The gunplay is simple and well done with guns sounding meaty. The lore in this game shapes up pretty well to the original lore except for a few places one place being the implamentation of the melta gun which instead of the constant stream it acts more like the shot gun of this game. The single player has a decent story with good gun play and fun if simple melee combat with some exceutions which are reasonably entertaining. The pvp multiplayer is a bit janky with some weapon changes from the single player but is overall solid. The exterminius multipler coop survival is fun and will provide some entertenment even if it gets repetitive. Overall a fun solid if repetitive game which is a worthy entry to a very small list of good warhammer 40k games.			",83,2,0,10,6,0,20

												У нас на руках лежит игра от студии Relic по вселенной Warhammer 40.000 под гордым названием Space Marine я как фанат данной вселенной долго ждал эту игру,ролики отрывочного геймплея что на E3 что из дневников разрабов обещали нам ну просто охренително ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥скую где уже не надо было щёлкать пальцами по мышке так как это уже изрядно поднадоело ,а нам датут толстую тушку космодесантника и на нас вывалят огромную кучу орков ну и свытекающими от сюда полследствиями,но теперь перейдем к цифрам:1)Сюжет: сценаристу я бы лично оторвал бы обе руки и засунул бы ему в задницу потому что такой кретинизм ещё уметь придумать надо,полная скукота и никаких сюжетных поворотов.2)Графон и окружение:карты дико страдают от гигантомании,ну уж слишком они большие в том смысле что идеш в общественную столовую а она высотой в 100 этажный дом текстурки нарисованы скудно,тупые 2D задники аля привет из 2000 года иногда радуют ток реально эпичные пеёзажи но таких моментов мжно по пальцам посчитать(их всего 2).Персонажи нарисованы мыльно,удары оружия как в японском мультеке:искры свет и радуга.3)Геймплей: геймплей сингла по началу представляет что то подобие прикольного =,но это все быстро переходит к идее плана вот тебе локация вырежи все живое на ней.4)Звук:звук оружия в игре реально приятный и радует.5)Мультиплеер:мультик был жив когда игра вышла было несколько режимов pvp типа анигиляция,флаг,превосходство с игроками сражаться интересно куча возможностей как себя повести и действовать печалит только классы их всго три:тактик,штурмовик,опустошитель,описывать их смысла нет так как у каждого свои особенности и фишки но сейчас либо игроков нет вообще или собираестя пати из скилованых ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ов за плечами которых с 1000 часов но в самомо начале он был очень увлекательным и именно за ним я и провел все 100 часов.PVE режим был тоже достаточно увлекательным в лане ты и 4 братюней бегаитеи нарезаите орков в колбасу при этом стараясь не здохнуть тоже очень классная вещь , ну перейдем к оценкам:Графон:5/10 в наше время такой графикой не удивишь.Звук 9/10 звук хорош и этого не отнять.Геймплей 6/10 в лане боёвки тоже есть недочеты.Мультиплеер 10/10 заслуженная оценка за те часы удовольствия что я провел в нем.Вообщем не плохой мультеплеерный шутер от 3 его лица тупым сиглом,но для любителей вахи пойдет.Общая оценка 7/10 но ток из за мультика.

												Endorsement: “A Gears of War-clone that should have replaced the original’s series” I love Gears of War as much as the next guy, it’s awesome and fun. But 40K Space Marines really gives Gears a run for its money in terms of quality of gameplay, and if fully realized, could have easily replaced Microsoft’s exclusive as king of 3rd Person Shooters.Pro:01)	 An action-style, Warhammer 40K game02)	 A genuine twist on the “Gears of War” formula that makes it a personal and engaging-style of play03)	 Visceral game that is hugely satisfying04)	 Uniquely-written characters that go against the “Vanilla, Angry-marine” clichéCons:X1) Gameplay can get too hectic for its unique-style, resulting in unfair deathsX2) Online modes are pretty barrenX3) The story is “porn” for Warhammer fans who want a Space Marine action-game, so you may be indifferent or constitute a contagious case of “eye rolling”Verdict:In a “What If” multiverse scenario, I’d rather see 40K Space Marine’s grow as a mainstay series than Gears. The game is extremely fun and has more gameplay potential than Gears of War could ever have. Get it if you’re looking for a unique-spin on the Gears formula ",215,6,0,7,4,0,16

												Space Marine - еще одно увлекательное погружение во вселенную Dawn of War.Relic молодцы, пошли на опасный эксперимент, и главное, все у них хорошо получилось.Из плюсов могу выделить атмосферу. Конечно, с полюбившейся мне с детства стратегией она не стравнится. Однако весьма неплоха. Ну и конечно, сложность. Играя на среднем уровне сложности, некторые моменты я перепроходил по 10 раз. И это хорошо, как я считаю.Минусы тоже есть. К примеру, бесполезные напарники. Они нужный лишь по сюжету, a в бою от них толка нету, разве что можно отвлечь противника на них, что бы заживить раны. Ну и конечно, большой минус - отстуствие РПГ состовляющей.

Now the game loads up to hearing ""sega"" then freezes. At this point alt tab doesn't function and i  ctr alt del to get to my desktop where the mouse curser is absent and nonfunctiona,l leading to me having to sign out in order to force the game to close.

												A fun, although short game. First, the bad. The dialog isn't fantastic and the character development, well, isn't there. However, this is an intensely fun game that feels well-paced for its length. The atmosphere of the 40k universe is expertly folded in, with no barrels of exposition running your way.

												If you like the tabletop and ever wondered what being a Space Marine would be like, then you need this game.  It is as close to how they should look and feel as we have.  Simple storyline, but like all 40K gets complicated past just orks.  The controls are fun, and a nice variation of well know weapons, and some newer ones mixed with some simple combos makes this great fun.And the multiplayer is great, who doesn't love Space Marine on Space Marine action?

												Warhammer 40k Space Marines is Relics first outing in the 3rd person shooter spectrum of the series and its a competent shooter that's lacking in variety, has a forgettable story with a very sequel bait-ish ending and on top of all that its single player lenght is nothing to write home about, barely passing the 7th hour mark on your first playthrough. All in all it is a commendable effort thanks in large part to the brutal and visceral combat worthy of your time and money.			",369,57,6,32,18,2,34

												The singleplayer offers 6-8 hours of brainless fun. No alternate pathways, no high difficulty settings (hardly any deaths on the hardest difficulty available), quite generic 40k story with the most obvious twists imaginable. It still manages to make you feel like a badass. Biggest letdown: Final boss fight is a quicktime event. Did not try the multiplayer (maybe yet, most likely will not).Worth a pickup while on sale for a few bucks (would have been disappointed at full price).			",96,7,1,5,4,0,10

												Borrows pretty heavily from popular TPS titles, but a lot of the features are tried and true and even if you've played enough of those games, the setting itself is enough to make it interesting. It felt a bit closed off, given you really only see the Ultramarines and Orcs (with various Chaos entities making their appearance eventually) when theres tons of races and chapters. If you love Warhammer and haven't played this, you probably owe it to yourself. There aren't many titles in the W40k library that focus solely on action so if you want to stop strategizing and just kill some greenskins, grab it on sale for a few bucks.			",169,10,2,13,1,0,16

												It's enjoyable enough, and definitely worth a look if you're a WH40K fan.It's very short, though. I installed it in the morning and finished the campaign in the evening. If you're not interested in the multiplayer (which I'm not) there isn't a whole lot of content to be worth the 30 or so they ask for. I picked it up on sale so I don't feel particularly burned by that. It's another one of those console ports that's designed to be beaten in a single rental session.The gameplay is more or less what you'd expect from a God of War clone, just set in the WH40K universe. You can tell Relic doesn't make this kind of game very often, because there isn't even the oh-so-modern feature of being able to huddle up against some cover at the push of a button, like you'd expect in Gears of War or Mass Effect or whatnot.The story was as mentioned very short, and kind of bland as well. Orks show up, Chaos shows up, you kill a lot of stuff and then it's over. That's about it.Still, smashing orkies with a power hammer was very enjoyable.			",139,27,12,23,18,0,53

												So far every other non RTS Warhammer 40.000 game has been pretty horrid. Space Marine on the other hand breaks the chain and delivers some pretty solid shooting and seamless melee combat. There will be plenty of Orks and Chaos Marines to kill and mame in the most brutal way. If WH40K is something you like be it the universe or just the look of heavy armors and the brutal weponry, you might just like this one.			",276,49,2,15,13,1,33

												Borrows pretty heavily from popular TPS titles, but a lot of the features are tried and true and even if you've played enough of those games, the setting itself is enough to make it interesting. It felt a bit closed off, given you really only see the Ultramarines and Orcs (with various Chaos entities making their appearance eventually) when theres tons of races and chapters. If you love Warhammer and haven't played this, you probably owe it to yourself. There aren't many titles in the W40k library that focus solely on action so if you want to stop strategizing and just kill some greenskins, grab it on sale for a few bucks.			",169,10,2,13,1,0,16

												Was fun for a short amount of time but even though the game is crazily short I don't feel like it was short enough.A few minor complaints, the way to regain health is tedious (and during the animation you're forced into, you can just lose the health you're trying to gain back)..and the over-righteous voices made me giggle rather than take a war game seriously.On the other hand, though, seeing the environments and the creatures of the warhammer universe come to life was pretty awesome, not into the collectibles figures myself but I always thought they looked really cool.Game was nothing more than visual entertainment for me, I much rather would've just watched someone play this.

												It's enjoyable enough, and definitely worth a look if you're a WH40K fan.It's very short, though. I installed it in the morning and finished the campaign in the evening. If you're not interested in the multiplayer (which I'm not) there isn't a whole lot of content to be worth the 30 or so they ask for. I picked it up on sale so I don't feel particularly burned by that. It's another one of those console ports that's designed to be beaten in a single rental session.The gameplay is more or less what you'd expect from a God of War clone, just set in the WH40K universe. You can tell Relic doesn't make this kind of game very often, because there isn't even the oh-so-modern feature of being able to huddle up against some cover at the push of a button, like you'd expect in Gears of War or Mass Effect or whatnot.The story was as mentioned very short, and kind of bland as well. Orks show up, Chaos shows up, you kill a lot of stuff and then it's over. That's about it.Still, smashing orkies with a power hammer was very enjoyable.			",139,27,12,23,18,0,53

												Totally underated game, and its the shame they won't be doing more.Very good portrayal of Space Marines in general and Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 universe.The weakness of this game is the combination of shooting and melee combat. The shooting is good but not as good and dedicated shooter game, the melee is good but not as good as dedicated melee games. This is an intrinsit problem when combining those two gameplay elements.7 / 10.			",160,101,2,51,17,1,11

												everything about the game is great except the the fact of it oppressing you of cheats. if we spend our money on a game it belongs to us we should have the decision and the right to use cheats or not. the fact they have the ordasity to stop this just shows they are nothing but fat 30 year olds that live with their parents in the basement that want nothing to stop their little universe to change. if they didnt want change they shouldnt have published it for public use. so conclusion is. gameplay brilliant. execute the game designers and deport their families to gulags for slave labour. and thats me being nice.

												BUY this this tough cookies and add into your library and collection. Why?? Warhammer 40,000 : Space Marine always had a 75% discount on Steam sales,is an EMPEROR SEND bargain for everyone of us; a nice,tough and tasty cookies. Though this games is out on 2011 but yet even for today the graphic in games still look magnificent and detailed. The campaign is tough and still is fun to play. It doesn't make the game become enduring repetition mode somehow is rather enjoyable. The control is smooth and fluid ;You can GUN,SLASH,HACK,POWER STOMP,BOMBARD and hv a cool EXECUTION feature as you progress through the storyline.  Please do abuse your weapon, fired to your heart content the ammo is well provided in games. DO NOT CONSERVE YOUR AMMO and have fun slayin the ORK. FOR THE EMPEROR !!!ACHTUNG!!  ATTENTION!! REMINDER : Do Not Buy DLC PACK as the multiplayer is pretty dead though there are still very little player. (Really little can count by 10 finger)Btw try checkout on KILLING FLOOR 2 is an one AWESOME games that every FPS lover should had !! THE Gore and Action...Oh God.....where do I begin.

												Warhammer 40k Space Marines is Relics first outing in the 3rd person shooter spectrum of the series and its a competent shooter that's lacking in variety, has a forgettable story with a very sequel bait-ish ending and on top of all that its single player lenght is nothing to write home about, barely passing the 7th hour mark on your first playthrough. All in all it is a commendable effort thanks in large part to the brutal and visceral combat worthy of your time and money.			",369,57,6,32,18,2,34

Moving aorund to avoid enemy fire is also kind of tricky as you will get stuck-ish on obstacles and debris.Manuvering does actually feel like you are encased in 20 tonns of steel.'Story' is predictable but ok.Overall i guess it surfs more on the IP than by its own merits, but its not crap.

There will be plenty of Orks and Chaos Marines to kill and mame in the most brutal way. If WH40K is something you like be it the universe or just the look of heavy armors and the brutal weponry, you might just like this one.			",276,49,2,15,13,1,33

												Totally underated game, and its the shame they won't be doing more.Very good portrayal of Space Marines in general and Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 universe.The weakness of this game is the combination of shooting and melee combat. The shooting is good but not as good and dedicated shooter game, the melee is good but not as good as dedicated melee games. This is an intrinsit problem when combining those two gameplay elements.7 / 10.			",160,101,2,51,17,1,11

												Meh but playable.Combat is quite repetitive. The introduction of new weapons mixes it up somewhat, but your abilities do not really change. Moving aorund to avoid enemy fire is also kind of tricky as you will get stuck-ish on obstacles and debris.Manuvering does actually feel like you are encased in 20 tonns of steel.'Story' is predictable but ok.Overall i guess it surfs more on the IP than by its own merits, but its not crap.

												PROS- The aesthetic of the game is perfect, the Space Marines exactly like they should, as do the daemons and the orks- The story line is very interesting and isn't just a ""There are bad guys here, go kill them"" sort story-The multiplayer allows for a person to not only choose from a selection of pre-made designs, but to also design their own chapter or warband-Captain Titus, while he is an Ultramarine, is not a rigid, ""the Codex Astartes doesn't say we can do this, so we shouldn't character""-While limited the selection of available weapons includes some of the best weapons available to Space Marines-The sound effects of each weapon sound realistic-Accessible to both fans of 40k and new people, without having to have a section of the game that is about universe buildingCONS-The main character is an Ultramarine (I don't dislike the Ultramarines, but there are other chapters)-The game takes place on a Forge World, but there are no Skitarii-Leandros is an example of why people hate the Ultramarines-The choice of weapons is limited-The final boss is a quick-time event-Unique armour sets only available through DLC-No Chaos campaignOverall, I think this game is very well made, despite the flaws.FOR THE EMPEROR or if you prefer FOR THE DARK GODS			",47,2,0,2,0,0,3

												OH. MY. GOD. This game was absolutely amazing, incredibly fun, and pretty dificult on normal mode. (either that or i just really suck) I honestly have never had so much fun on any single game that I have ever played, this is truely awesome. Hopefully the sequel to it is equally or even better, since it does kinda set up for another game at the end. Although I never buy games when they first come out, I would definately get the sequel on the release date, even if it is $60. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes FPS's, but if your new to the War 40K universe, fear not for newcommers are not required to know much about the lore. And I still have to play multiplayer yet, since I put 9.8 hours into the incredibly long campaign. (But its not too long where you'll get borde, obviously)12/10 would fall naked into pile of cactus to get a sequel.			",118,5,0,7,10,1,26

												What to say about this mediocre experience. For a game like this you need a variety of enemy types and punchy memorable weapons but this game has neither. the worst offender is the grenades, you throw them they go pfft and people fall down out of pity laugh at you call you a ♥♥♥♥♥ and get back up with nought but a scratch. But the saving grace for games with♥♥♥♥♥♥weapons is boss fights, If you have good boss fights they can make or break a game, so what are this games boss fights like? Well first of there ""boss fight"" just one, singular and it sucks. Lets call it standard boss fight 26 alpha, large man runs at you, you dive roll to the side, shoot boss while he tries to remember where he left his keys, and if he remembered to turn the stove off. Now, on to the topic of collectables the reward for the players who explore your game world. This game follows what most action games leave laying around, that right ♥♥♥♥ing audio logs. This is not a reward you story is♥♥♥♥♥♥i dont need to know more about it. You know if i added up all the audio logs ive collected in my life i could make the worlds ♥♥♥♥♥iest radio drama. Also this game is ♥♥♥♥ing pitiful as a challenge to be overcome I was playing on hard and i still only died twice because the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ai doesnt pay attention to you if you're a certain distance away. So you will make good friends with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sniper rifle. So all in all i cant recommend you buy this game its boring, repetitive and worst of all it was written by a bunch of baboons.

												Just bought this yesterday and after beating the campaign I was surprised to find that the multiplayer can still put a decent game together. I can almost always find an Exterminatus game (horde mode) and the gamemode Seize Ground usually has players in it as well. I recommend however that anyone looking to buy this and play multiplayer, first rank up to at least level ten in Exterminatus to get into pvp, since a variety of weapons and different perks only come through levelling up. That said, the pvp balance in this game is for♥♥♥♥♥♥ not necessarily the weapons, but the way the clasees are used and to what extent.Multiplayer overallPro's-Exterminatus and Seize ground are somewhat active-No dedicated servers it seems, but switching hosts only takes a few seconds which is really nice-Armor customization objectives and acheivements add some pretty dank armor and something to play for-Dlc isnt overbearing given that most people play classic anyways-Gameplay really comes down to the situation you find yourself in most (Weapon and class loadout)  and what role you want to play on the battlefield-It only took around 12 hours, probably less, of gameplay to unlock most of the weaponsCons-A space marine can somehow get killed from the rocket boost of an assault pack, and in general you will usually die instantly-a few seconds after being fired upon-Host changes can interupt gameplay and break immersion. (Pauses everything though, so you dont die from it usually)-There is no limit to the type of class there can be on the field at any one time meaning Assault and lascannon spam-One perk pretty much screws an entire class, that being the Tactical Marine, and the perk in question being two main weapons. All this creates is a lack of tactical diversity and more spam-Lower level players will have a lot of difficulty playing the class Tactial Marine since the default bolter is a decent all rounder but is almost useless against the Assault Marine or anything at long range for that matter-Maps can get really repetitive and after about eight hours of gameplay you'll get bored of both exterminatus and versus gamemodes-Higher level players have the advantage of strong weapons and experience, new players will die a lot, and in general you cant take much damage from direct hits which is strange-Back to back deaths without a kill, much less a minute or two of gameplay IG are way too common-The bolter is essentially useless, and overall game balance suffers because of it. With all the different weapons in the game, its become very specialised. Close quarters? Melta/Storm Bolter. Mid Range? Stalker/Plasma. Long Range? Stalker/Lascannon(Devastator class only)I really dont understand why they took out the kraken-round bolter from the campaign.Campaign12/10 would miss like 12 servo skulls somehow again(Story doesnt have much depth nor do the characters but I bought this game to kill♥♥♥♥♥♥in the name of the Emperor so I liked it).Your average person, should I buy it?When its NOT on sale no, on sale at a good discount, yes its fun./tg/ Should you buy it?Of course, you have to buy it in the name of your Spiritual Leige. (Seriously you'll like it)DLCDont bother with it, from what I've gathered from other reviews it seems everyone just plays classic anyways, for the skins and gear, no, unless you're a lore/40k buff and really enjoy buring heretics with your Salamanders armor, but as always do it at a discount. (War gear seems to have the same stats as the default but im not so sure about rate of fire or swing rate so yeah...)I really hope Relic and Sega do more with this game like making the time to kill higher, or release another, too bad its Sega.

												I'm really amazed I don't see any mention of this, but even though the battle system is nice and seems good at first glance, you'll quickly notice this is far from true. There are only 2 ways to regain life, 1 is activating a timed system which will regenerate you for the duration and the other is killing enemies with a special move. Now that sounds fine, but killing enemies with a special move is where the problem lies. During this killing move, you are vulnerable, because it takes a few seconds you WILL get hit at least a couple of times, making the entire special kill worthless and it will cause you to die instead of gain health half of the time.

Or having a rediculous amount of DLC on Day 1 of reliese but find it completely useless as no one plays it now.  Or how aimbots and cheats cover most pvp servers.I can't recommend it.  Unfortunately, a Space Marine is not enough too make up for the money grubers looking to squeeze every dime out of us without regard too quality of content.

												I've given this game a ""thumbs down"" but more because of its current state than because of its raw potential.  If you're buying it for online play...don't.  The online community seems to basically be dead now.  This is a shame because, back when the game first came out, it was a blast to play, with some fun customization for your avatar in terms of wearing different armor and painting it.  (My two favs were playing as a Death Company Blood Angel assault trooper, or a loyalist from one of the Horus Heresy traitor legions wearing pre-heresy armor.)  VERY RARELY, you can find a decent game of basic assault, but pretty much all of the DLC is now useless otherwise (e.g. Dreadnought mode, Exterminatus, the Chaos exterminatus version).  If you can find 16 other people who own this game, you might be able to host a game yourself, but then you'd better hope they live near you.  The problem with the game's multiplayer is that it uses an internal matchmaking system a la Left 4 Dead and shoves you into a game hosted by one of the players.  This means there are no dedicated servers, and, coupled with the dwindling of the in-game community, you could be playing with people on the other side of the damn planet for all you know.  Also, if the host leaves, the game will make someone else the host, which can mean that a good game turns to crap (or vice versa) out of nowhere.  This is a TERRIBLE design approach.That said, the single-player game is fun, if you view it as a videogame and not as a representation of 40K fluff.  Yes, you'll be powerful, but you won't be fluff-level powerful in most cases.  The combat system in this is extremely similar to that found in Darksiders, only the environments are a lot less open and a good bit more linear.  Combat, once you get the hang of it, is fun, though.  Unfortunately, it's also quite short.On the whole, at this point, I'd say buy the game when it goes on sale at, say, $10 or so.  Much more than that, and it probably isn't worth it, given that the SP campaign is extremely short, and Exterminatus on your own is dull and usually ends quickly anyway.			",140,37,1,15,11,4,41

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!This is probably one of the worst ports I've played so far on the PC. This game was pretty clearly developed for console. With little video settings to change, there isn't much wiggle room for people who want to tweak their performance issues, which you will probably have.Even if you do get the game to run at a reasonable framerate, there's the multiplayer issues. For the most part the gameplay is fun, but is totally ruined by the fact that the player base is SO small, and there are no dedicated servers. This is done much like how Gears of War 1 P2P servers worked, as in it didn't. These local hosts usually either live in the UK, or in Africa. Pings usually are yellow or red, and there is a ""dynamic"" host changer to ""optimize"" everyones pings, but this ends up in the game locking itself every 5 minute for about 3 minutes saying ""Changing Host"".I only bought this game because I'm a huge fan of the 40K lore, don't buy this game.

												Its decent. The storyline was fun, and the combat was good enough that you dont really notice the orks all being similar for a while. However, two things i think let this game down.1. Ultramarines. Ultramarines. Ultramarines. When will games workshop learn that there are more interesting chapters than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ultrasmurfs? Granted, two out of three of the main marine characters were pretty cool, but even so...they need to cope with their obsession.2. Online. The online is awesome, but its dead. Barely anyone plays it anymore. Ive tried so many times to play a dreadnought map, and failed each and every single time. The only players left on the servers are hardcore players, making it far too difficult for a newb to get anywhere fast. There IS a feature that allows you to temporarly copy the gear of someone who killed you, which eases this a little though.in conclusion, i got the one filled with DLC goodness for £10. It was worth it. But unless its sold for that price again, i wouldnt reccommend buying it. Campaign wont satisfy you for long, and online just dousnt work very well.			",101,4,0,15,4,1,14

												great visuals, good gameplay and a finely crafted varying storyline. the difficulty is right up there and not in a good way. artifical difficulty at the hands of greater NUMBERS is all the apparently unskilled combat designers could come up with. oh and did i mention the rubbish checkpoints and heal/finisher times that are not only long and ardious but also allow you to take damage while going in for a healing meale kill.6/10, good game, but is all grinding and very little enjoyment when (usally) you are in a wave fight where all you do is fight waves of increseingly difficult enimies untill you wonder why you even bothered.on that point i really cannott reccomend.

												Unless you have intentions of playing the multiplayer portion save half the cash and don't buy the DLC, wish i had looked more thoroughly into the DLC before wasting my money on it, i thought at least some of it might have been singleplayer orientated but alas that is not the case.

												Don't by this game if you just plan on playing the campaign like I did. The story is very so-so, and the gameplay is extremely generic and boring and it just drags on and on. The only really feeling of joy I got from the campaign was during the jump pack sections (Which are relatively rare). If you're looking for a semi competent third person shooter multiplay and are okay with no cover system this may be the game for you. Just don't expect it to ever be competative because the game also lacks dedicated servers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game follows through the warhammer 40k franchise, offering a fast paced, brutal 3rd person shooter experience. There is plenty of action to be had, murdering hordes of orks and chaos followers but unfortunately you'll often find this game lacking. The battle mechanics are repetitive and somewhat clunky, while the difficulty rises up unreasonably high at times. The graphics are acceptable. The multiplayer part is peer-to-peer only so it's a failure from the get go. Verdict : Nothing special. 6/10			",86,13,0,14,5,0,17

												Repetitive combat and what I considered to be a very boring story.  The most fun I had in this was from the jet pack that you get randomly throughout the game.  However, they are short lived intervals and then it's back to the grind.  This is comparable to Gears of War with more melee combat, but is much less interesting and the environments are bland.

												Warhammer 40k: Spacemarine is a game so caught up in doing a half-arsed job of emulating other successful games, it has no identity of its own. The gunplay is a poor knock-off of Gears of War and the melee combat is a poor knock-off of Arkham Asylum, and the difficulty alternates between snooze fest to rage fest between each encounter. Melee combat has only half a dozen moves per weapon (with just three weapons) and performing the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ finishing move over and over again to regenerate health is a wearying necessity to stay alive, so wading out into the fray is more of a chore than the visceral joy it should be. This is especially true when the ork rocket troopers are introduced en masse as, with no a cover system and a character who moves with all the speed and grace of a sack of potatoes, you'll be obliterated in seconds flat if you aren't constantly leaching enemies for health.The story is uninspired, too. No spoilers here but if you're familiar with the 40k universe, it's pretty predictable stuff.If I had to say something positive about this game, it would be about how appealing the art style and lore is. Then again, considering that these was borrowed from Games Workshop and aren't added to in any meaningful way, it's not credit which the developers are due. The guns feel ok, I suppose, nothing to get too excited about though. Seriously, if I weren't such a fan of Warhammer, there's no way I would have soldiered on to the five hour mark before quitting for good.There is no reason to play Space Marine. Play one of the Gears of War games or Arkham games or, if you want to play something set in the 40k universe, one of the Dawn of War games. Relic should stick to strategy games, they're out of their element here.			",185,58,0,17,18,1,25

												I can not recomend this game at all. If you're a diehard Warhammer 40k fan, then by all means, enjoy the singleplayer and extermanatus modes. Those modes were a lot of fun, and made for some good gaming. The controlls are ok, but the movement is very clunky at best. Multiplayer is unbalanced and complete garbage at times. You will often find yourself on the losing team with no way to bounce back. Framerates will drop super low often, and ruin your best planned ambushes. And what ever you do, DO NOT BUY THE DLC!!!!! If you want to enjoy Chaos Unleashed, be prepared to wait for hours untill you find the 10 people in the world who actually bought it. Don't even bother with drednaught assult, because no one has it. I just wish I played less than 2 hours on this game so that I could refund it. Now I'm stuck with it. It's one saving grace is the fact that it's better than the consol version.   *Update* For a better Multiplayer expiriance, play Warhammer40K: Eternal Crusade. It's not finished, but it's a vastly supirior game, and much more fun to play.			",49,2,0,6,2,0,18

Your target, orc's, terranids, choes, elves, just anything that threatens the empire, and EVERYTHING threatens the empire.  So join the war, and start kicking♥♥♥♥♥Well, that would be nice... but this game has some critical flaws.  Like rewarding AFKer's while providing no way to kick them.  Or having a rediculous amount of DLC on Day 1 of reliese but find it completely useless as no one plays it now.  Or how aimbots and cheats cover most pvp servers.I can't recommend it.  Unfortunately, a Space Marine is not enough too make up for the money grubers looking to squeeze every dime out of us without regard too quality of content.  Sorry, but don't waste your money on this... buy a game that was completed.			",360,68,6,41,41,3,83

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!This is probably one of the worst ports I've played so far on the PC. This game was pretty clearly developed for console. With little video settings to change, there isn't much wiggle room for people who want to tweak their performance issues, which you will probably have.Even if you do get the game to run at a reasonable framerate, there's the multiplayer issues. For the most part the gameplay is fun, but is totally ruined by the fact that the player base is SO small, and there are no dedicated servers. This is done much like how Gears of War 1 P2P servers worked, as in it didn't. These local hosts usually either live in the UK, or in Africa. Pings usually are yellow or red, and there is a ""dynamic"" host changer to ""optimize"" everyones pings, but this ends up in the game locking itself every 5 minute for about 3 minutes saying ""Changing Host"".I only bought this game because I'm a huge fan of the 40K lore, don't buy this game.

												Its decent. The storyline was fun, and the combat was good enough that you dont really notice the orks all being similar for a while. However, two things i think let this game down.1. Ultramarines. Ultramarines. Ultramarines. When will games workshop learn that there are more interesting chapters than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ultrasmurfs? Granted, two out of three of the main marine characters were pretty cool, but even so...they need to cope with their obsession.2. Online. The online is awesome, but its dead. Barely anyone plays it anymore. Ive tried so many times to play a dreadnought map, and failed each and every single time. The only players left on the servers are hardcore players, making it far too difficult for a newb to get anywhere fast. There IS a feature that allows you to temporarly copy the gear of someone who killed you, which eases this a little though.in conclusion, i got the one filled with DLC goodness for £10. It was worth it. But unless its sold for that price again, i wouldnt reccommend buying it. Campaign wont satisfy you for long, and online just dousnt work very well.			",101,4,0,15,4,1,14

												Advantages:- Nice armor and environment designs- Weapons with different mechanics- Unusual multiplayer experience thanks to jetpacks and melee combat- Deep visual customization in multiplayer- Brutal executionsDisadvantages:- Very stiff acting and naive storyline- Extremely short campaign and only two bosses (both very easy)- Game is easy even on the hard difficulty (and I actually started playing it on hard right off the bat)- Environments are pointlessly very large and empty, some areas suggest they were created to be used for something, it's like two different people took care of surroundings and enemy spawns, the maps have great unused potential- Can't climb laddersI got this game on a -75% sale and I'm happy to have it, I like the multiplayer because it is quite original, yet I wouldn't pay the full price, that's why I don't recommend this game, but I think buying it is not a sin, especially if you're a fan of Warhammer.

												Warhammer 40k: Space Marine is a decent shooter with two scoops of Warhammer 40k lore. It mixes streamlined combo-based melee brawling and simple long-range cover-reliant shooting. Neither the melee nor ranged combat get terribly complicated, but they don't have to. The game's level design is marred by a frustrating one-two punch: uninspired and frustrating ""arena"" combat areas, and poor checkpoint placement. I haven't tried the multiplayer, which seems to be a major selling point, so I might be missing what makes this game good. On the merits of its single-player campaign it's not bad, but you can do better for your time and money.			",219,57,2,23,22,1,46

												subpar to my expectations, I think I bought this game(apart from the super awesome cover art) to get to know the world of warhammer 40k more, I visited Gameworkshop and played a WH40k game on my n-gage, and so I was kinda hoping this game would make me familiar with the universe. an example of a game which did just that splendidly was the Game of Thrones game, I've never watched the series, the game had both great gameplay and twist but also delved into the GOT world details so heavily I didn't follow much, but enough to get a feel for it, to become familiar with it. there was a lot of story there.in Space Marine the gameplay design is mediocre, it's fun and great, but you've had the same experience in a gaziliion games before, and there isn't any new experience. very liniear, too simplistic level designs, and I might say the graphics are also a disappointment but that wouldn't be fair of me, since I'm playing this game in 2015. the story isn't that complicated either.I came here wanting to get to know the world and the races and the politics and the history, was I got are enemies of different colors and weapons to kill in many many ways. fun, repetetive, not what I was looking for.oh, and the button mapping is the worst I can think of in recent memory.and one last thing, i realized later on that the game has huge structures and beatuiful environements. however they're all up such that they don't appear in your normal view while going around, you have to stop and look up at them, if the camera was zoomed out while not in combat or centered up that might've made you enjoy the scenery more.

												I'm someone that loves WH40k and this game is a good entry into the universe. BUTT. There are a lot of reasons why this game just isn't as good as it could/should be. Firstly, the story is short. Very shot. Like you can probably beat this game in one sitting short. But you could tell that they wanted to do more with the story in future additions. So while the story is short, and there isn't a lot or any replayability on that end, lets turn to the multiplayer.The multiplayer is utterly abysmal. Let me elaborate. Character and class customization is cool and allows you to play as almost any of your favorite Chapter/Warband. Finding a game is almost impossible, most of the time there is only one game running and because it's all player hosted, get ready for lag. And lag plays a very key role in a firefight. For example, you can melee attack someone 5 times and do no damage despite it looking like you're doing damage, then all of a sudden you're dead because during that time the enemy appeared to be standing still, he was actually beating your skull in with a chainsword. Hacking is very rampant now compared to back when this game first came out. My guess is there is no anti-cheat, or if there is, it's very far out of date. So expect the random getting killed through walls, across the map one shot head shots, and the snap pistol shots from an assault marine in mid air right before he crushes you. All in all, there was an opportunity for greatness that feel short (RIP THQ). I only recommend buying this game if it's heavily discounted and even then, don't expect much. Stick to the story, and only venture into multiplayer if you're brave or ready for lots of frustration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a very bad port of a console game to PC. Multiplayer has no option for dedicated servers and is entirely peer to peer, and thus is plagued by pervasive lag problems. There were periods of days when users spent hours waiting for a game due to it not being able to connect. I didn't have the patience for that nonsense myself. Single player is uninspired. Despite having good voice actors like Mark Strong, the script is insipid, and the voice actors are not given a lot to work with. Single player plays like a beat em up with guns where you run into mobs of enemies to clear after traversing lots of empty space. The final boss fight is a joke and perhaps, best exemplifies what type of decisions went into making the game: defeating the end boss involves following on-screen prompts to click the left mouse button repeatedly, followed by the space button, with an occasional f button, done about a dozen times. Even the animations were as repetitive as the prompts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A decent game that is plauged by several bad things..Console feeling? Check!Still buggy? Check!Repetive combat? Check!Crappy story?.. Kinda check!I do love warhammer 40k but this is probably the worst one i would still play so if you are a big fan of the serie you could give it a go but if you changed the character for something out of another game i would probably never touch this.Keep in mind that i never really tried multi player bit it looks as generic as the rest.

												This game follows through the warhammer 40k franchise, offering a fast paced, brutal 3rd person shooter experience. There is plenty of action to be had, murdering hordes of orks and chaos followers but unfortunately you'll often find this game lacking. The battle mechanics are repetitive and somewhat clunky, while the difficulty rises up unreasonably high at times. The graphics are acceptable. The multiplayer part is peer-to-peer only so it's a failure from the get go. Verdict : Nothing special. 6/10			",86,13,0,14,5,0,17

												Fun game, but I have to say this game has the worst maintenance I have ever seen. We spend more time waiting for ""hosts migrations"", lag, and game matches than actual game play time.

												I can not recomend this game at all. If you're a diehard Warhammer 40k fan, then by all means, enjoy the singleplayer and extermanatus modes. Those modes were a lot of fun, and made for some good gaming. The controlls are ok, but the movement is very clunky at best. Multiplayer is unbalanced and complete garbage at times. You will often find yourself on the losing team with no way to bounce back. Framerates will drop super low often, and ruin your best planned ambushes. And what ever you do, DO NOT BUY THE DLC!!!!! If you want to enjoy Chaos Unleashed, be prepared to wait for hours untill you find the 10 people in the world who actually bought it. Don't even bother with drednaught assult, because no one has it. I just wish I played less than 2 hours on this game so that I could refund it. Now I'm stuck with it. It's one saving grace is the fact that it's better than the consol version.   *Update* For a better Multiplayer expiriance, play Warhammer40K: Eternal Crusade. It's not finished, but it's a vastly supirior game, and much more fun to play.			",49,2,0,6,2,0,18

												OH. MY. GOD. This game was absolutely amazing, incredibly fun, and pretty dificult on normal mode. (either that or i just really suck) I honestly have never had so much fun on any single game that I have ever played, this is truely awesome. Hopefully the sequel to it is equally or even better, since it does kinda set up for another game at the end. Although I never buy games when they first come out, I would definately get the sequel on the release date, even if it is $60. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes FPS's, but if your new to the War 40K universe, fear not for newcommers are not required to know much about the lore. And I still have to play multiplayer yet, since I put 9.8 hours into the incredibly long campaign. (But its not too long where you'll get borde, obviously)12/10 would fall naked into pile of cactus to get a sequel.			",118,5,0,7,10,1,26

												No NightLord preset for Multiplayer :(Aside from that...You get to kill orcs over and over again with chainswords and bolters.  What's not to love?Unless....You get tired of that.  Then you are **** out of luck because that is pretty much all this game has to offer.  Only other thing to do is the competitive multiplayer which is... ok.  It's not mind blowing, but worth it if you love 40k, are interested in 40k, or get the chance to snag it when it is on sale.			",129,9,2,18,4,1,8

												Just bought this yesterday and after beating the campaign I was surprised to find that the multiplayer can still put a decent game together. I can almost always find an Exterminatus game (horde mode) and the gamemode Seize Ground usually has players in it as well. I recommend however that anyone looking to buy this and play multiplayer, first rank up to at least level ten in Exterminatus to get into pvp, since a variety of weapons and different perks only come through levelling up. That said, the pvp balance in this game is for♥♥♥♥♥♥ not necessarily the weapons, but the way the clasees are used and to what extent.Multiplayer overallPro's-Exterminatus and Seize ground are somewhat active-No dedicated servers it seems, but switching hosts only takes a few seconds which is really nice-Armor customization objectives and acheivements add some pretty dank armor and something to play for-Dlc isnt overbearing given that most people play classic anyways-Gameplay really comes down to the situation you find yourself in most (Weapon and class loadout)  and what role you want to play on the battlefield-It only took around 12 hours, probably less, of gameplay to unlock most of the weaponsCons-A space marine can somehow get killed from the rocket boost of an assault pack, and in general you will usually die instantly-a few seconds after being fired upon-Host changes can interupt gameplay and break immersion. (Pauses everything though, so you dont die from it usually)-There is no limit to the type of class there can be on the field at any one time meaning Assault and lascannon spam-One perk pretty much screws an entire class, that being the Tactical Marine, and the perk in question being two main weapons. All this creates is a lack of tactical diversity and more spam-Lower level players will have a lot of difficulty playing the class Tactial Marine since the default bolter is a decent all rounder but is almost useless against the Assault Marine or anything at long range for that matter-Maps can get really repetitive and after about eight hours of gameplay you'll get bored of both exterminatus and versus gamemodes-Higher level players have the advantage of strong weapons and experience, new players will die a lot, and in general you cant take much damage from direct hits which is strange-Back to back deaths without a kill, much less a minute or two of gameplay IG are way too common-The bolter is essentially useless, and overall game balance suffers because of it. With all the different weapons in the game, its become very specialised. Close quarters? Melta/Storm Bolter. Mid Range? Stalker/Plasma. Long Range? Stalker/Lascannon(Devastator class only)I really dont understand why they took out the kraken-round bolter from the campaign.Campaign12/10 would miss like 12 servo skulls somehow again(Story doesnt have much depth nor do the characters but I bought this game to kill♥♥♥♥♥♥in the name of the Emperor so I liked it).Your average person, should I buy it?When its NOT on sale no, on sale at a good discount, yes its fun./tg/ Should you buy it?Of course, you have to buy it in the name of your Spiritual Leige. (Seriously you'll like it)DLCDont bother with it, from what I've gathered from other reviews it seems everyone just plays classic anyways, for the skins and gear, no, unless you're a lore/40k buff and really enjoy buring heretics with your Salamanders armor, but as always do it at a discount. (War gear seems to have the same stats as the default but im not so sure about rate of fire or swing rate so yeah...)I really hope Relic and Sega do more with this game like making the time to kill higher, or release another, too bad its Sega.

												Warhammer 40k Space Marine...Well, this is going to be predictable as hell. For those of you that know what I mean by ""predictable"" I mean over done, and here's why: The Space marines have been on almost all the marketing for Warhammer 40k. Because of simple box art this usually results in people outside of the fanbase thinking ""oh hey, those are the good guy Spartan people from Halo of duty fighting demons in Hasbro reskin armor....Let's go make a chess game out of it...With grenades and AOE attacks...Ya'know, just like chess.""So you better like the Space marines 99% of the time because that's what you are going to get until someone revisits Fire Warrior, or release a game about Eldar, Imperial Guard, hell the Orks sound fun! ♥♥♥♥ it, let's begin the review. The Campaign  You play as captain Titus, an ULTRAH SPHESS MEHRIEN! sent to this Forge world with a mission to retake the city from the massive Ork horde. But wait! Turns out the Orks are being led by someone with a brain! Just so you know I'm being sarcastic, it's no surprise who it really is and the videos on the store page give it away before you even purchase the game. There isn't much to talk about the campaign for Space Marine, it's simply 'meh' it's not bad but it isn't good either. It's just...Decent, at least enough to keep you going, unless you get tired of getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by Nobs in tight hallways. The Gameplay  To be honest I'm a little disappointed. The execution animations get tiresome after a few hours so that means you'll be playing this game in sips.The ranged weapons also feel dull, and campaired to the awesome power of the melee weapons within the game I felt like there was no point to the guns. It's like giving the player Excalibur at the very start of a game then tell him/her that he/she should use a squirt gun instead...Chances are you're going to go with the over powered weapon they just gave you.But if that was the only flaw within the gameplay I would call this just nit picking. Unfortunately this is a console port...Best way to say that is ""♥♥♥♥ keyboard players!""I rarely use controllers since I play 70% of the time on my desktop/laptop. But there are games out there that are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to play without a controller. So, how bad is it? Well the mouse feels slow and unresponsive. The keys are placed in odd areas on the keyboard, for example: by default the 'ctrl' key is the aim button. Character movement on the keyboard is sluggish and hard to control, espeically while sprinting- (I feel like I'm driving a heavily armored gothic bumper car with chainsaws attached! and there are no breaks!)And then there is the audio...The XBOX360 version of Space Marine's sound is perfectly fine, but on the PC? Sound tearing everywhere! This happens generally when there are a large amount of enemies in the area, this is a game about fighting Orks by the way...Enjoy the sound of- ""WAAAAAAA-RIIIIIIIP*STUTTERSTUTTER*-AAAAAAAH!!!!"" I assume Space Marine suffers the same problem Source games have, but I can't confirm this so I won't go into too much depth about it (god knows I get enough flame wars on these reviews just for saying Hack'n'Slash instead of Hash'n'Slash...Yeah don't ask) The Multiplayer  Normally I'd say the more content the better, but I think multiplayer is the reason why less attention was placed into the singleplayer. But besides that, you start off with a class selection and a long♥♥♥♥♥road of unlocks (oh joy) Tactical, your basic soldier with a bolter rifle and a selection of grenades. After progressing for a while in multiplayer you'll find yourself with a wide selection of guns to use such as- the Plasma gun, sniper rifle, storm bolter, and finally a grenade launcher. Sadly other bolter varients from the lore are not in the game. Also the flame thrower isn't in there either which I have a hard time understanding.Heavy bolter marine, he starts out with a heavy bolter but eventually you get a las canon and a plasma cannon. Although I don't know why because the only ""vehicle"" in multiplayer is the Dreadnought, and that's a 9.99 DLC! Finally the Assault trooper, this is the most fun you'll get in multiplayer, jumping around from place to place with your jetpack. You start out with a chain sword but eventually you unlock stuff like the power axe and the thunder hammer. Sadly he dominates the other two classes once you get the hammer and it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥just killing one of them. The Final Verdict  When I first bought this game I wanted to give this game at least a 7/10! But later down the road I realised this game is mostly generic. And at it's worst, the PC port was hard to play with all the audio tearing and bugs.Then the multiplayer didn't help with the stupid♥♥♥♥♥progression system children these days demand we have in all of our game selections. If there were no loadouts or leveling system, just pick a gun up off the map then it would be fine. But because Call of Cancer has devoured the minds and hearts of game developers, publishers, and consumers alike we may never see triple A titles free themselves from this terrible trend.Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a 5/10! The console version is a 6/10, but only because the controls and the movement were smoother, and the audio wasn't making my ears bleed. It's decent, but that's all this game has to throw. My suggestion? Get this game when it's on sale, because Relic are a collection of fairly decent folk it goes on sale around 17 bucks every now and then. Until someone stops making Space Marine centered games I'm going to wait another 5 years.			",112,1,0,6,2,0,16

												Despite what contemporary reviews may say, the single player experience is enjoyable. While certain elements can be considered competitive, if played in modest real-world installments this is not noticable at all. Furthermore, the combat and weaponry is simply so fun and accessible that each combat scenario is fun and engaging. I can only imagine that when co-op is available it will only increase the playability. Multiplayer is also interesting, although not my primary draw.The graphics, voice work, and attention to setting in particular is worthy of merit. I think being a Warhammer universe fan is understandably critical to getting a bit more out of appreciating the work that went into this. Is it worth $50? Possibly. Should you buy it the minute it goes on sale or when co-op becomes available in about a month or so? Definitely. Either way, it will not be a bad investment of your money. Because whether some may feel its an average game or above-average game, it's quality work.			",356,102,12,52,42,4,50

												This game is very short and very linear, but what is there is very enjoyable and satisfying. Merging shooting and melee combat seamlessly, providing a very exciting experience. The multiplayer, however is very weak as it has no ded servers and host migration issues happen quite often. If you can bear with those issues, though, you're in for a very enjoyable multiplayer experience with Exterminatus Arena and Deathmatch.Grab this game when it's on sale and ignore all but the Chaos Unleashed DLC for Exterminatus and Dreadnaught DLC for Deathmatch.

												The story mode to this game is intense.I remember the feeling I got, walking into an Imperial Guard encampment for the first time. It was like walking as a god among mere mortals.I had just staved off a small horde of Orcs assaulting their defenses. After wiping them out, the plebian soldiers bowed and saluted - hailing me as their hero as I strode through their halls.10/10, would be revered as a divine savior and ultimate badass again.

												Warhammer 40k Space Marine...Well, this is going to be predictable as hell. For those of you that know what I mean by ""predictable"" I mean over done, and here's why: The Space marines have been on almost all the marketing for Warhammer 40k. Because of simple box art this usually results in people outside of the fanbase thinking ""oh hey, those are the good guy Spartan people from Halo of duty fighting demons in Hasbro reskin armor....Let's go make a chess game out of it...With grenades and AOE attacks...Ya'know, just like chess.""So you better like the Space marines 99% of the time because that's what you are going to get until someone revisits Fire Warrior, or release a game about Eldar, Imperial Guard, hell the Orks sound fun! ♥♥♥♥ it, let's begin the review. The Campaign  You play as captain Titus, an ULTRAH SPHESS MEHRIEN! sent to this Forge world with a mission to retake the city from the massive Ork horde. But wait! Turns out the Orks are being led by someone with a brain! Just so you know I'm being sarcastic, it's no surprise who it really is and the videos on the store page give it away before you even purchase the game. There isn't much to talk about the campaign for Space Marine, it's simply 'meh' it's not bad but it isn't good either. It's just...Decent, at least enough to keep you going, unless you get tired of getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by Nobs in tight hallways. The Gameplay  To be honest I'm a little disappointed. The execution animations get tiresome after a few hours so that means you'll be playing this game in sips.The ranged weapons also feel dull, and campaired to the awesome power of the melee weapons within the game I felt like there was no point to the guns. It's like giving the player Excalibur at the very start of a game then tell him/her that he/she should use a squirt gun instead...Chances are you're going to go with the over powered weapon they just gave you.But if that was the only flaw within the gameplay I would call this just nit picking. Unfortunately this is a console port...Best way to say that is ""♥♥♥♥ keyboard players!""I rarely use controllers since I play 70% of the time on my desktop/laptop. But there are games out there that are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to play without a controller. So, how bad is it? Well the mouse feels slow and unresponsive. The keys are placed in odd areas on the keyboard, for example: by default the 'ctrl' key is the aim button. Character movement on the keyboard is sluggish and hard to control, espeically while sprinting- (I feel like I'm driving a heavily armored gothic bumper car with chainsaws attached! and there are no breaks!)And then there is the audio...The XBOX360 version of Space Marine's sound is perfectly fine, but on the PC? Sound tearing everywhere! This happens generally when there are a large amount of enemies in the area, this is a game about fighting Orks by the way...Enjoy the sound of- ""WAAAAAAA-RIIIIIIIP*STUTTERSTUTTER*-AAAAAAAH!!!!"" I assume Space Marine suffers the same problem Source games have, but I can't confirm this so I won't go into too much depth about it (god knows I get enough flame wars on these reviews just for saying Hack'n'Slash instead of Hash'n'Slash...Yeah don't ask) The Multiplayer  Normally I'd say the more content the better, but I think multiplayer is the reason why less attention was placed into the singleplayer. But besides that, you start off with a class selection and a long♥♥♥♥♥road of unlocks (oh joy) Tactical, your basic soldier with a bolter rifle and a selection of grenades. After progressing for a while in multiplayer you'll find yourself with a wide selection of guns to use such as- the Plasma gun, sniper rifle, storm bolter, and finally a grenade launcher. Sadly other bolter varients from the lore are not in the game. Also the flame thrower isn't in there either which I have a hard time understanding.Heavy bolter marine, he starts out with a heavy bolter but eventually you get a las canon and a plasma cannon. Although I don't know why because the only ""vehicle"" in multiplayer is the Dreadnought, and that's a 9.99 DLC! Finally the Assault trooper, this is the most fun you'll get in multiplayer, jumping around from place to place with your jetpack. You start out with a chain sword but eventually you unlock stuff like the power axe and the thunder hammer. Sadly he dominates the other two classes once you get the hammer and it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥just killing one of them. The Final Verdict  When I first bought this game I wanted to give this game at least a 7/10! But later down the road I realised this game is mostly generic. And at it's worst, the PC port was hard to play with all the audio tearing and bugs.Then the multiplayer didn't help with the stupid♥♥♥♥♥progression system children these days demand we have in all of our game selections. If there were no loadouts or leveling system, just pick a gun up off the map then it would be fine. But because Call of Cancer has devoured the minds and hearts of game developers, publishers, and consumers alike we may never see triple A titles free themselves from this terrible trend.Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine is a 5/10! The console version is a 6/10, but only because the controls and the movement were smoother, and the audio wasn't making my ears bleed. It's decent, but that's all this game has to throw. My suggestion? Get this game when it's on sale, because Relic are a collection of fairly decent folk it goes on sale around 17 bucks every now and then. Until someone stops making Space Marine centered games I'm going to wait another 5 years.			",112,1,0,6,2,0,16

												While I recommend this game, it comes with a serious warning. Do not buy this game unless you just want to play as a space marine. The story is simplistic, predictable and dragged out. The end boss is nothing more than an arena fight followed by a hotkey spamming session. That said, this game does make you feel like a space marine. This is not a bad game, just painfully average.

												Lately I'm not a huge third person or even first person shooter fan for that matter, but got this game pretty cheap and I must say I'm glad I did. Intended only to play it right now for the sake of steam cards, but got sucked into an over 3 hour play session, and only stopped because I need to eat and sleep at some point. So what can I say about it? Well if you're into insanely chaotic battles, this may be the game for you. There is a good selection of weapons to aquire along the way, it has strong combat mechanics, it is challenging at times, you'll likely will die from time to time, the voice acting is great, and well... It's damn amazing. Haven't tried multiplayer yet though, not really interested in trying at this time, but I'd still recommend this game to anyone looking for some intense action if you find it discounted.

												Not bad at all.  Movement is a bit clunky - you cant turn and run, but its not bad.Online play is almost non-existent now, so you are just stuck with the single-player mode, which is fine.

												I like this game, but there's a lot wrong with it. For example checkpoint saves. Why? Secondly, random slow down on screen and no FPS drop. Literally, things go slow-mo for no reason at times. And, this problem has existed for a while, too. With QA like this, THQ deserves the slide they're in. The Art department needs a ♥♥♥♥ing raise and employment else where as they did a fantastic job. In fact, all of Relic did great here, but THQ constraints no doubt put a damper on a lot of the awesome, leaving a great game just being good. The biggest and most daming problem is the multiplayer: No ♥♥♥♥ing dedicated servers? Kiss my ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥ Dedicated servers are ♥♥♥♥ing superior to P2P. Not only that, the game builds up the customization of the player only to LOCK AWAY ALL OF THE ♥♥♥♥ING CUSTOMIZATION. Almost no one plays online, so when you unlock the Customizer, you have ♥♥♥♥ all save for paint jobs. Unlocks are a fad that needs to ♥♥♥♥ing go the way of the dodo.			",249,12,16,13,48,2,43

												I wouldn't pay for than $5 for this. It is a very medicore FPS game.  Sure the Warhammer universe is nice, but take that away and you have a very linerar, uninsipred shooter.I didn't complete the game.  It has one of those cardinal sins.  Right before the big boss fight, you have this unskippable monolog the bad guys gives.  So each time you have to re-try the final fight, you have to sti through the whole thing all over again.In any case,  what I presume to be the final fight, is uninsipred, with just a bunch of waves of enemies you fought before.  Pretty much thats all it has been for the past few levels anyway, only in the end, you get them all at once.  It is also only an 8 hour game.  I do not undersand why FPS publishers think super short games are reasonable.  Virtually every other genra of game gives you far more hours per dollar spent.			",173,37,0,73,40,0,75

												""Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine"". The game where you're supposed to be the best of the best. One of the strongest thing in the Imperium of Man, however. That is not the case. I bought this game on release a few years ago when it was released and stopped at just at the beginning of Chapter 3. But as the years passed. I couldn't exactly remember why I put down the game, I saw it in my library and figured I'd reinstall it. I couldn't phantom why I put the game down without finishing it. So I booted up Singleplayer again to finish my campaign.  I recall watching an interview for the game before its release. I remember them saying, ""You're a Space Marine. Cover is for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Space Marine is designed to keep you in the fight."" They completely failed on this. The combat is awful. You aren't a Space Marine, you're a ♥♥♥♥♥. Your shields go down in an instant until you get the Iron Halo (which is at the end of the game). You can be torn to shred by Orks no problem. Even the standard Chaos Space Marines you encounter later on the game are tougher than you are. Combat is flawed from the very beginning. Since you aren't supposed to be in cover, you're getting shot all the time. No matter where you are. There is no rest in a fight. You're always being hit unless you retreat back and hide behind some crates. Even then, most of the enemies. including the orks have unnatural accuracy. You'll learn to despise the Orks with Rokkit Launchas and Chaos Marines with Plasma Cannons, as they'll volley over any cover you're hiding behind and hit you directly. But then, it doesn't matter. Since the game doesn't focus around cover, you'll still take damage from any rockets or grenades that explode on the other side of what you're hiding behind. One hit is enough to completely remove your shield, and two or three more will outright kill you. So if you get hit by all three rokkits at once? You're dead. The game largely revolves around staying in melee combat and preforming executions to keep yourself going. However, if you try to preform one while in the middle of combat, you'll either get the same amount of health you started with, or you'll just die. As I mentioned, enemies have an unnatural accuracy with all their weapon. During the cut scenes for the executions, you can (and will) still get hit by any ranged or unit within melee range. The unnatural accuracy also extends to the point where they can fire through their teammates and still hit you without killing their buddies. (Excluding Grenades and Rokkit Launchas). Later on in the game you'll start encountering chaos pyskers, they'll fire a beam at you and if you're hit in the open by one. You're as good as dead.  Fights are all designed around this type of encounter. An extremely powerful ranged unit in the back (or several). While you get swarmed by melee infantry which can quickly over run you. So most of the game is just back peddling into corners to deal with all the melee infantry before you can peek out and take a few pot shots at the ranged units, as staying out for more than a few shots will generally get you killed. This if course, gets worse along in the game as you go from dealing with Orks to Chaos. At some points you'll be getting bombarded by plasma weapons, pyskers and swarmed by traitor guards and regular chaos space marines. Most of those fights require simply dumb luck and very slow movements to progress through. Dealing with Chaos is simply a cluster♥♥♥♥, as when you're distracted with those who pose a threat, you'll be getting shot by traitor guard, who serve no purpose other than to take up half of your screen with the hit indicator.  So the game is about 6-8 hours of the same combat over and over, ontop of artificial difficulty. It quickly gets frustrating as the game has no actual save system, just check points. Which is extremely annoying as dying some times will put you back right before a lengthy cut scene. (Looking at you, boss fights). Which are unskippable. The game is the same story as literally every other Warhammer game. You're under attack by orks, then SURPRISE ITS CHAOS, even though it was completely obvious from the beginning.  Even the very end wave fight is awful, and insanely harder than the last boss.It consist of going through several waves of enemies with little to no cover. Each wave having more♥♥♥♥♥♥tacked onto it. If you fail it, you have to start back down the hallway so you have to run back and watch the same few minute long cutscene again. The Boss fight after it is a compete joke, its an on-rails quick time event where you fall down a spire. A few moments have free movement where you can dodge stuff thrown at you. For some reason you can fire, but Titus just holds his gun to the side and all the bullets fly off the screen.  The secret to killing the boss is this: 1-1-1, hit space, 1-1-1, hit space. Hit F, cutscene. Repeat x2-3 times. Congrats, you win.TL:DR?- You play as a weak♥♥♥♥♥Space Marine Captain.- Muh Ultrasmurfs.- Awful, repetitive combat.- Extremely accurate orcs.- Demons are somehow weaker than Chaos Marines.- Same exact story as any of the other games.- Bad check point system.- Dead Multiplayer. If you're a 40k fan, you'll find several annoying flaws in the game. So I'd recommend passing this game up and go play Dawn of War or Chaos Gate. Something else worth your time. If you're looking to have some fun and don't care about repetitive combat. Pick it up for when its less than 20 on a steam sale, forget about all the DLC since mutliplayer is dead.If you're looking to just play Multiplayer. Don't. The only active game mode is Exterminatus, all of the others are dead. Including the DLC ones, even Chaos Exterminatus. So save yourself the money.			",166,15,2,37,26,3,50

												This is a bad game, hiding behaind a great license. It is very pretty, very repetitive, and presents Space Marines as slightly stronger than your average Ork.What this game does best, by far, is present a stunningly beautiful graphical display. The Ultramarines, weapons, jump packs, and world at large faithfully recreate the best iteration of a Warhammer 40K universe in any game out there. I believe this is what has led to so many positive reviews. The gameplay however, is not good. Repetitive to the extreme, hordes of enemies come at you, and you press X a lot. When a larger enemy comes at you, you press Y, then X a lot. Sometimes you press B as a ""finishing move"" which restores health. Each weapon has two finishing move animations. You will see them a lot.What is more infuriating however, is how this game does the exact opposite of what we all hoped it would; play a near-invincible juggernaut that is a Space Marine captain. Far from feeling invulnerable however, you will quickly learn that small groups of enemies can take you down very quickly. Individual Orks take 6-8 shots from your heavy bolter to kill. Your two squadmate Ultramarines are borderline useless, and any form of squad tactics are completely absent. And for some reason, Relic decided to use the Halo-style personal shield for the Space Marines. Meaning, as you wade into combat, you will frequently need to run away and duck behind a corner for your shield to regenerate. It is also notworthy that this game has no form of a ""cover"" system.Very pretty, very repetitive, makes Space Marines out as slightly stronger imperial guardsmen. If that sounds appealing to you, this is your game.			",115,40,0,82,24,3,54

												I re-completed this game on Hard some time ago, and though it was somewhat fun while it lasted, the game is, in fact, far from perfect in most aspects.The most obvious flaw of the game is its repetitivity. Throughout the story different weapons and enchancements become available, sure, but essentially the gameplay situations themselves are becoming more and more of a deja vu as you proceed.  You jump into some new portion of terrain. There are Ork. You have to battle through their forces to reach a more powerful group of Ork, then you either interact with something or get a vox-transmission from your allies, and the next portion of terrain (and Ork) unlocks.  You reach a relatively vast area with a passage which is locked. You have to reflect an enemy attack to proceed (sometimes one of your followers are busy with certain story action while you cover them). There is always an elevated area you cannot get to, from which the waves of enemies come.  You are trapped in an arena-shaped location. A boss calls in waves of enemies. When you are done with them, he gets to you and you have to complete a QTE for a cinematographic KO.There are some refreshing moments, like jetpack riding, but they are like dessert, before which you always get to eat another full pot of cereal. Perhaps, it would be less noticeable if the game would turn out to be less absurd by both the terms of WH40K canon and mere common sense.  A forge-world, the marvel of imperial engineering, basically supposed to be a giant temple of Omnissiah, is protected by imperial guardsmen instead of Legiones Skitarii. I mean, how lore ignorant could that possibly be? It`s essentially like guarding a Pentagon with one 80-year old grandpa with a pre-WWII hunting rifle.  _Three_ space marines dealing first with an entire Ork WAAAAGH, warboss included, then  with a warband of a prized Chaos champion followers, the champion himself included, too, is this an actual game storyline or a teenage fanfiction? If things worked that way, none would dare attack any imperial world - there are certainly enough space marines to put just three of them to guard each planet.  An Ultramarine captain tells his fellow Ultramarine he did wrong by strictly abiding the Codex. I wonder if the developers just happened to run into a list of bad WH40K-themed jokes and thought they would paste them into the script - or rather just make them a script.Overall, the singleplayer part of the game is just not worth the pain. The multiplayer has a lot less sharp edges and generally allows more diversity, but still looks like a semi-serious wannabe-Warhammer game, with power armor painted all colours of rainbow (acceptable for Chaos, but nonsense for loyalists) and a pretty standard, though entertaining, gameplay. There is also Dreadnought assault, but finding an active game is extreme luck. Whoever finds himself a fan of the 40K universe should probably only buy this with a major discount.

												Space Marine.... as long time fan of Warhammer 40.000 universum ( and tabletop wargame ) I was curious about this game a lot. It was a bit of let down. First impressions are great, Astartes feels bulky and heavy, atmosphere is breathing 40k greatly but it kinda vanish after couple of levels and then there are problems. This game is very repetitive. You really do just 1 thing all the time. Levels are plain and bit boring by design. Essentialy you are either inside where there is not much difference between different buildings or you are outside which is only differently textured hallway...no big open spaces.Also if you are fan of 40k and know something about Space Marines you´ll get dissapointed some more. Bolter feels good, sound is great, overall awesome but performance in actuall killing is underwhelming. Ork boy wearing a t-shirt  easily takes  4-5 rounds to body which is in fluff enough to put down a space marine in power armour. Another thing which felt a bit wrong was that you play as Ultramarine, a chapter known best for their tactical aproach to things and here it´s really just bloodbath more suited for say Space Wolves or World Eaters... it just doesn´t feel like Ultramarine.So if you are not a fan of 40k or you don´t know about it a bit there is slightly above average 3rd person shooter/slasher for you. You´re gonna play it, finish it but you won´t probably remember it. 6/10If you are fan of 40k you´re gonna joy puke at the beginning (especially if you are imperial fan, as I am chaos player in tabletop) but you are gonna be sorely dissapointed by the end of it if you even make it there. 5/10			",24,1,0,11,1,1,9

												Singleplayer is okay, multiplayer is a mess.  Not enough games running anymore.  You'll have 1 or 2 games, and you can't even choose which one you join, the game picks for you.Your competition is either outright hacking or so ridiculously skilled that it's not worth playing with them.  There's a handful of players out there with 3-1 or 4-1 kill ratios, and everyone else on the server is 1:1 or worse.  If they outnumber each other on a team, the game will go 1000-50 score and no one will have any fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, I'm a big fan of Warhammer 40k setting, tabletop games and PC strategy games; I LOVED the possibility of playing in an action game based in this universe: being a Space Marine, saving Imperial Guardsmen, meeting Inquisitors and defeating Chaos.I hoped it was good. I WANTED it to be good....however, this game is AWFUL.What we've got here is a boring, linear, repetitive third person action/shooter game. Every area is structured as an ""arena"" where you'll fight endless hordes of Orks (with a little variation in the last hours) with no strategy, timing or ability involved. Again and again. And again.These fights will be EXTREMELY easy, except for some difficulty spikes thrown randomly into the game. When you die you never feel like it was your fault, nor you feel to improve your abilities when you defeat 10 or 15 'Ard Boyz.Then there's the setting. Every ambient has no details and is identical to the one before and to the next one, meaning you'll be frequently lost and looking for an exit. There's no map, but don't worry: once you've reached an area you won't be able to go back to the previous one, meaning that exploration is absolutely useless. Moreover, you don't get any strategic benefit from the environment, except for some explosive barrels or crates of ammo & granades once in a while, so why bother?In the end, this game was a huge disappointment for me. Go buy it ONLY if you know and love Warhammer 40k lore and the only thing you want to do for the next 15 hours is press X on your controller. Over and over again.			",127,56,0,27,6,3,27

												My problem with this game is in its combat system. It have a melle combat and quite a lot of ranged weapons. It mix very well and its fluid, but there is a bit of a problem if you use melle as a primary combat choice.The strongest melle weapon in the game, called Thunder Hammer, locks you to using only 2 ranged weapon slots from total of 4. And those 2 slots are reserved to a pistol and your standart Space Marine rifle. It would not not be a big problem, if the game didnt switch to a huge shooting galery in the middle of the game.In the first half of the game those combat arenas are fine, because you can get to 95% of the enimes on foot and the enimes have good mix of ranged and melle units. But as you progress through the game, most enemies start to be a very powerful ranged units and on top of that, those combat arenas will restrict your movement in a way that you cant reach those units on foot.So only choise you have is to shoot them down, with ranged weapons which are pistol and standart rifle. The rifle does the job quite well, but you need a lot of bullets just to shoot down 1 guy, so you burn through your ammo very quickly. That leaves you with a pistol that have unlimited ammo but have no damage and no accuracy. This is where the frustration comes in, because the game become unnecessary difficult and punishes melle playstyle.			",123,27,10,11,11,1,23

												I bought this game thinking it would be exciting, but sadly I was wrong. The graphics are terrible on the highest settings, luckily the fps is amazing and doesn't drop but the animations and graphics are truely shocking and horrific. People talk to you whilst looking the other way, soldier's legs move randomly in all directions. The story is incredibly boring and un realistic. The weapons are terrible and you run out of ammo almost instantly. Combat is slow and annoying because you keep attacked by 100 Orks and you have to kill them all with these stupid animations that let you take damage whilst attacking.I would recommend staying away from this cheap, old game and buy a better 3rd person shooter like GTA 5!

												Warhammer 40k: Space Marine is basically Gears of War without the mantle/cover mechanic. That and it takes place in the Warhammer 40k universe, which is just the ultimate best. The multiplayer is still very much active and fantastic. It has your standard deathmatch modes and an Exterminatus mode, not unlike Horde mode from Gears. The only flaw I've noticed in this game, the dialogue is inaudible unless you are directly facing the speaking NPC.EDIT: That last bit isn't actually a problem.

												It's difficult not to write a negative review for this on the basis that Warhammer 40,000 is crowding out the possibility of a Warhammer Fantasy game ever being made, at least a good one, but, trying not to be bitter about that, I have to admit that this is a good FPS. Didn't care much for the multiplayer, but the single player game is excellent, would play through it again. Can't go wrong with stomping Orcs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played through the solo-campaign in this third-person shooter and I was kind of blasted. Im a huge Warhammer 40K fan and this game was basically a must buy for me. If you finished the campaign which took me like 5 or 6 hours the bloodthirst of your bolta is not over, not even close to be over! The war continues in fast paced online battles where you gain levels for achiving challenges or killing other players. You unlock new outfits and new weapons. There are not many maps, but the maps available are awesome and hard to master. I can REALLY recommend this to EVERYONE who loves Warhammer 40k, you will not regret it. For all guys who like action, grab it aswell! For those who like to experience a long single player campaign, this is not the game you are looking for. PS: The DLC`s are actually worth it.

												So I bought this off of the back of Totalbiscuit's nerdgasm of a First Impressions video. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, I encounted unbearable reverb on the sound effects that drowned out music and dialogue. Worse, even Space Marine's pretty dedicated fanbase is apparently unable to fix. But I muted the soundeffects (music & voice acting is fine) and proceeded onwards.  The gameplay is good, nice weapon and enemy variety, voice acting is pretty solid and the story is passable enough. I haven't touched the multiplayer.Then, my save file corrupted and I ended up stuck at the end of a level with an absent cutscene trigger. It has a single savefile (smauto.dsav) hidden away in the Steam userdata folder, which you can only back up by copying and pasting.Sega Support's only solution was create a new save file AKA restart the campaign. Let's just say I wasn't happy.Though I liked playing it, I'm can't recommend it. The lack of soundeffects soured the experience considerably, let alone the eleven hours of gameplay lost to a in-game save system that is frankly unfit for PC. I shouldn't have to exit the game to create a separate save file. These two issues have killed any desire I had to play the game.It is however a rarely authentic Warhammer 40k experience. If you buy it, remember to back up your saves regularly to save yourself some grief.TL;DR+Positives+Authentic Warhammer 40kGood gunplay, simple yet fun meleeVaried enemies & weaponsSolid performance by the cast-Negatives-An unfixable bug that creates unbearable reverb on sound effects.Muted weapons make me sad.Single save file system is susceptible to corruption, which will force you to restart the campaign.Manually saving (as in locate, copy and paste the smauto.dsav) is annoying.A solid game with one immersion-killing technical issue and another of the potentially gamebreaking variety. Your experiences may differ, but it might not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The online mods are varied, and I'd love to play them, but theres never enough people online. Maybe you're get a few for Exterminatus (pve/horde mode) but thats about it. The Marine cutomization is pretty cool too, but you need to play online to unlock more armor. You see where the innate issue is here.			",164,44,0,19,7,0,28

												I've been a fan of the Dawn of War series, the tabletop Warhammer games, even the Soul Drinkers Omnibus. This game is marketed well and looks good in all the videos, but I ended up feeling more like the WH40K universe got shoehorned into a procedural shooter. I never felt like I was part of a squad, and that's bad unit coherency.			",105,61,0,21,3,0,23

												This game had a huge amount of promise and it just fails to deliver on every front. It could have been designed as a shooter, or it could have been designed as a melee combat game and done very well at either role. Instead it does ""OK"" at both roles. In addition you are walking a hallway. Yes, the hallways have different textures and sometimes cover but they are literally hallways that define the path you must take. I haven't seen combat like this since I played side scrollers on the neo-geo, Space Marine may be 3d but the gameplay is the same. If the game gave you an open map, and you had more use of the jump pack the game would double the fun that it is, but you don't. So I don't recommend this game unless you just have to own everything 40k or you really love Space Marines. The novels describing the 40k Universe portray a gritty Universe of depth that you can imagine, somehow upon seeing the world in Space Marine it manages to make it unreal and shallow.

												It's kinda weird, but those Warhammer guys know how to make a damn good game. RTS, action, doesn't mattter. Space Marine is a real work of♥♥♥♥♥kicking art. It's just too damn bad they don't have dedicated servers for multiplayer, and the single player is a bit of a snore.Must play.10 / 12			",721,226,15,79,62,10,111

												Great game, multiplayer sucks but the co-op is awesome, however the co-op is brought down by you have to play the multiplayer in order to have an easier time with the co-op. Which means you get to deal with the down sides of the gameCase and point1. The Fanatics- these are the guys that are obssesed with Warhammer 40K and no life the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game, they are all max level and have unlocked all the stuff, avoid these guys at all costs cause they're annoying since they always scream weird stuff into the microphone and spam chat, they generally have seriously Warhammer specific names.2. The Hackers- These dudes are everywhere, since the anti-cheat is no more for this game i think they do pretty much whatever they want and you're only option is to leave the game.3. The Host Migration- Since the game doesn't have dedicated servers it's like COD on console, sometimes you get lucky and the host migrates once every couple of matches or you get ♥♥♥♥♥tormed by migrations as everyone has a bad connection.4. The Teleporting- If you're unlucky enough to get this problem then just try going into a different lobby or gamemode otherwise prepare for the rage as you get destroyed by everyone since you are lagging like crazy, this happens even if you have fantastic ping by the way so either wait it out or go search for a new gameOverall, i really like the game, i havent beaten the campaign yet, going to soon probably. Try avoiding the multiplayer unless you need something, it's really not worth the rage so stick to co-op, which is called Exterminatus.I personally give the game 7/10 Killstreak Kills			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Had high hopes for this game even after hearing the odd average review but even though visually the game is fantastic it falls short of being truly enjoyable.While the combat is engaging to begin with, mowing down hundreds of orcs starts getting a little monotonous after a while. The lack of character customisation is a let down as well and while the storyline is engaging, it's nothing new for a hardened space marine.Had fun playing the game but it's linearity and lack of replayability means I wouldn't really recommend it unless you pick it up for a bargain. Warhammer 40k fans will enjoy the Dawn of War II series much more.			",49,5,0,11,1,0,6

												Nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia. As a huge 40k fan in my childhood, I don’t know why it took me so long to play this game. Has been in my library for about 2 years and just never played it. Boy, was I missing out. The game plays similar to Prototype, but much simpler controls for use on a keyboard. The story line is nice, I wasn’t a big follower of 40k lore, but that didn’t matter, you get caught up on everything fairly quickly and I came out the end knowing that little bit more about the Warhammer universe.  The game’s length is just about right;  it does however leaves open ends to the story which could lead to a sequel which would be nice.  If you are a fan of the 40k series, this game is certainly worth a go, I loved seeing all of the different races and army’s come into life, Orcs, undead, Chaos, all there. Not sure how much someone would get out of it if they weren’t a fan of the series though – might just be a run of the mill hack-n-slash to them. Still, recommend a play through for what it costs.

												I love Warhammer 40k, and have painted and collected miniatures for years. The graphics and gameplay on this game are decent. But that being said, I found the game to be a total chore. It's just a boring, mediocre slog through piles of orks with an unengaging story. That's the whole single player game. I suppose the online gameplay would add more, but that's not my cup of tea.This would be a title to pick up on sale for $5, but since its GW, don't hold your breath.			",58,12,2,12,4,0,12

DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE MULTIPLAYER.DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE MULTIPLAYER.DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE MULTIPLAYER.Client-side hosting that'll sporadically migrate hosts regardless of if the host has a good enough connection, often chosing the worst host as far from the other players as it possibly can. You're forced to play competitive multiplayer if you want to unlock armor pieces or weapon perks that actually make your weapons useful, even if you only have interest in playing the cooperative mode.Third party programs exist that allow cheating in multiplayer, so it's kinda sketchy trying to grind up or get achievements when you don't know if you're playing against legitimate players or not. It's already difficult enough when you're being SMASHED because you don't have the same perks unlocked, but you'll usually run into the same crowd of people as the MP community is small as can be. And alot of times, they seem dedicated to emptying out the server/community by conducting themselves as trolly as they can, an example being a clan stacking nothing but lascanons on open maps.On the other hand, it has a pretty solid single-player and the cooperative mode can be fun if you get a bunch of buddies in a private match, it's basically like Mass Effect 3's multi, survive through x amount of waves of enemy, maybe a capture the point objective here... Just don't do an open match. Even if you and your buddy start the match, some random person from across the world may end up in your game and for some reason, this game will decide to migrate the host to them and now you and your buddy have to leave because your connection is now ♥♥♥♥ed.There is a diamond in the rough here, it's just so rough you'll perhaps find yourself bitterly glad THQ went out of business and wishing the same of Relic.

												Never really been a fan of the Warhammer 40K series, but to me this has the stink of a cheap cash-in.Story mode may or may not be interesting to those well versed in the series' lore, but to me it was rather dull. Competitive multiplayer seems unbalanced. And co-op while fun for a little while has its problems and becomes stale rather quickly, made worse by difficulty not scaling for the number of players and dying often while waiting for a fancy animation to finish (animations which can't be cancelled out).There are far worse games out there but I honestly couldn't recommend this one.

												Just finished the Singleplayer campaign .... Linear leveldesign, alot of story cramped into a small amount of time, multiple bossfights set in the last hour of gameplay, little variation in enemies.HOWEVER ... the guns are great, the levels (though linear) look great, the cutscenes dont interupt anything, enough quiet hallways and small walks to calm down and both the melee as well as gun combat are freaking amazing. Bullets feel as if they have weight, lasers feel like they would go right through any enemy and axes, swords and hammers really feel like you are squishing their guts right into the ground.You want open world design, all fitting lore and facts and realistic small group battles? At least give the demo a try.If you want to feel allmighty, killing multiple orcs with 1 swing of your massive hammer or blow the head right of a demon? Instantly buy this game :DOne of the few games ive finished in a looooong time (addicted to buying games, rarely fully finish them :P) .. might go for some more achievs though ;D			",390,101,10,77,22,5,63

												2/10This game was 4 years in the making, and has that feel that if they'd had 6 more months they could have made something truly awesomeThey didn'tSadly, they didn'tIt's a pity, because I really wanted to like this one, even if there was an Ultramarine, rather than any of the more interesting options (I sense the heavy hand of GW marketing there)This game's single player campaign lasts areound 9 hours2 of those hours are spent riding in liftsanother half hour is spent on cut scenes, leaving a short 3rd person shooterSomehow, in that short time, it still manages to get repetitive, tedious and boring.The designers went with the decision of making one model per enemy class, making about 20 different things to hit in total. When they attack in hordes of a half-dozen at a time, the lack of variety shows. When these same hordes attack in consecutive rooms for an hour, you give in to despair. Identical hordes charging headlong would have seemed OK if they were Tyranic, but Da Orkz is famous for their kustom jobz and variety.This makes it feel cheap and rushed, which is a shame.

												Overall, the story is cliche' and can be seen from 3 miles off by a blind guy including all the plot twists. This wouldn't be an issue, if not for the fact that the game seems intent on minimizing any of the interesting things within the 40k lore, you don't see any of the awesome armor of the Imperial Guard laying waste at range (yes, yes, I know, they were being overran, but then we should have seen Orkz with looted tanks, then, eh?), Space Marine mechs, or the tons of baddies and variants of the Chaos and Orkz forces. This felt less like a planet wide invasion and war than it did a strike force, and this is made all the worse when you see that even when Chaos forces are preparing to invade and wreck things, there are only the most minor of vehicles of the Guardsmen in any respect. Even when the Imperial fleet arrives, you don't see any vehicles really, aside from troop transport ships... This could be forgiven if the gameplay was amazing, but that is next.The gameplay is repetitive, and I can already hear folks say, ""Well yeah, you're a Space Marine, of course! You are meant to kill things over and over!"". There is one major problem though... You feel invincible. Aside from 1-2 deaths from being cornered as I rolled into a wall, there wasn't anything to fear. The AI went to the Herpa Derp school of combat, and this is most clearly seen by the Chaos Marines. They seemingly forget that their most hated enemy, the Space Marines, were just shooting at them, only to have you step around and then look at you as they ponder if you'll be their friend. ""Maybe this time we can frolic in the fields of bones and snuggle vorpal bunnies as the blood fountains start in the background!"" I don't expect super secret tactics taught to only the most elite of forces, but I do expect more then move left, move right, then get shot, or to stare at you with their heads conveniently out of cover. Orkz should be more charging and melee (which I admit many of thier units are melee which is nice, but far too squishy for even the standard bolter). The Chaos forces are just sort of a joke, especially the Guardsmen, and even their marines are a simple headshot with the laser cannon, they feel less like a real challenge as opposed to being really ""challenged"". What's more, there is a lot of padding as you walk through various corridors of rubble, and without a jump feature (aside from some of the funnest sections of the game which are all too brief, and honestly the the only major redeemer in single player) it greatly limits exploration in a giant planet factory. About 9 models for the Orkz which is sad given Orkz are not what one would call ""organized"" with standard gear aside from some having melee primarily, others ranged, you can't expect every Ork unit to be exactly the same.  It's even worse with Chaos, as the idea is these units are being warped into monsters essentially at random (as if Chaos wasn't a hint at that), clocking in with 8 models as well. These counts are including the Warboss of the Orkz, as well as the Chaos Commander of the Chaos forces. If I am off, the count is likely not off by more then 1-2 as I recall the units from memory. I'm not saying make every single unit look different, that would be an insane task when you have a swarm of Orkz coming down on you, but you do expect to see more then one model for every enemy (with the exception, perhaps, of the standard daemons of Chaos). This could have been achieved easily with something so simple as some minor palet and texture swaps on the faces, and 2-4 scars made for the Orkz to put on faces randomly upon spawn. Yeah, it wouldn't change much, but it wouldn't look as bland, and would take little work. I'll grant you, Chaos would be harder to make have variants, because for all intents and purposes, the Chaos forces (the marine portions there of, and the corrupted Guardsmen) look the same as their Space Marine counterparts, aside from palet swaps of course for the most part, but that isn't to say you can't have tumors or something (again, 2-4 variations) to help liven up the roster so it doesn't look like you're killing a corrupted Guardsmen, and his 15 identical brothers who all so happen to work for Chaos too. As has been said already, the game feels dull, and if not for the sale, I'd say it's not worth it. Even with the sale, it took me 6.9 hours to complete the campaign while a cat ""helped"" me play. Was it worth 7.50 USD? Yes, but not much more, as much of that playtime was padded by lifts of inexplicable requirement, and hallways of nothing but ammo and the occassional collectable.  4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a review for single player only.First of all nevermind the fact that the game looks like absolute 4rse, one can get over it.But the whole game simply bored me like a very few other.The plot is a snoozefest and I couldn't care less anything said during the dialogs.Unfortunately I couldn't get my XInput controller to work with this game, but I didn't make much effort to do so, since you have ranged weapons and I'd prefer K+M aim over it. However the implemantation of it or simply the character movements don't feel good at all.Your character, Captain Titus, moves so slowly, sluggishly that it's just not fun to control. It would be balanced by your melee attacks feeling powerful, hacking through dozens of orc (and other creatures) however the pacing is so bad that sometimes the game feels either too easy or way to hard. When easy you get the ""Aaww yeah I'm so powerful"" feeling while you still have to keep an eye on your health. However when the game is hard, you have to move with a snail's pace in order to not get killed within a few seconds and at lest in my opinion this isn't the game's primary goal.Also you have to stun then execute enemies in order to regain health. However the animations for it are so lengthy that you can get killed by doing so. You would think that during the __lengthy__ execution animations you wouldn't be hurt to balance it but nope... I got killed so many times while regaining health that I'd simply given up on melee and only used it when there were very few enemies around.The gameplay and said pacing: kill a bunch of enemies, ""run"" a bit, press ""e"" to open door, get in elevator, wait for your mentally challenged AI partners to get in the elevator, press ""e"" to start elevator, rinse and repeat. That's it. (Oh yeah, there was a turret section once, ""great fun""...)Speaking of AIs, it's bad... horribly so... The friendly AIs sometimes don't shoot at all at enemies and/or simply just stand in the line of friendly/enemy fire or just blocking your way...Overall I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. Even I couldn't be bothered to play through it, even though I hate not finishing something.			",288,44,6,36,18,3,22

												Recognition as an action game:As an action game, Spacemarine genuinely does what it set out to do: It is a relatively fast paced- and sometimes intense game with a lot of blood flying all over the place, orcs roaring at you, guns blazing like nobody's business and you seldomly have a quiet moment. Multiplayer is a disaster though and the DLC is infuriatingly obvious and sickening.Recognition as a Warhammer 40k game:Oh my, where to start? I will be brief and without too much detail, but trust me I could say a LOT! about this game- Anyway. This game is such an absolute disappointment due to its incredible ""surfacey"" modus operandi. It never ever explores the WH40K lore in any appreciable depth (and the list of missing things is huge), it never gives you any choices, it never gets tactical and the whole thing feels very ""consoley"" and cheap - This is a VERY poor representation of WH40K and is barely what I'd call a game.

												Many years I waited. Stalking this thing in the background. The cancellations. The change of company hands. And the promises..oh the many many promises. As a raving frothing at the mouth ""FOR THE EMPEROR!!"" type its at least a borderline acceptable 40k game. However for the average gamer it will be a beautiful 40k game graphically but gameplay wise it is very lacking. It has a shield and health system similar to that of halo and a perspective like that of the gears of war games. The combat is a hack and slash system that lacks a block button, emphasizes stun locking, and gives you the ability to dodge roll. Then of course it wouldn't be 40k without guns but you can compare that to gears of war without a cover system. You can charge through ""some"" objects(very very few)which occasionally feels awesome. I have personally beaten the game on all difficulties be it through a console or PC and the game becomes most difficult when the armies of chaos appear. They tried to make a story that was honestly fairly good for the time when it was released, but it is the survival mode that stood out to me and kept me coming back when I would have cast it aside much sooner. But in conclusion for the many years I sat watching all the tidbits and development occur I find this game disappointing and unless your a frothy mouthed space marine lover like myself this game is something I would honestly pass up and look toward something else.

												If you're going to get this game for the Online, don't bother. It's absolutely abysmal and all people do is use the same 2 weapons over and over and you're going to get nowhere at all and it is nothing but frusterating. The campaign on top of that is also not worth the money, either.The only somewhat fun mode is the Survival mode and even when its not worth it because you actually have to level up for equipment and, if you want anything worth using, you have to go to the multiplayer to get unlocks.Overall 4/10 game, don't waste your money on this. How it has 93% Positive rating is beyond me. On top of that, you're barely ever going to actually find servers and well, community splitting DLC is a no go. I'd rather play Aliens: Colonial Marines.

												I got this game while it was on a Steam sale, and am VERY glad I did - it's frankly not worth $30 U.S., mostly due to the disappointing campaign.The whole sordid affair took me less than six hours to beat, the lore was so deep that a sizable number of the references they dropped in-game made no sense, and the ending left me with the same bad taste in my mouth as Halo 2 and Half Life 2 - huge amounts of build-up to a supremely disappointing let-down. The gameplay was solid and chopping down swarms of Orks was satisfying to the Nth degree, but they make the classic blunder of introducing a new bad guy 3/4 of the way through the game.  I haven't tried the multiplayer, and frankly don't intend to.  If I wanted a game that had to surive on its multiplayer content, I would have bought Modern Borefare 12 or something like that.In sum: incredible potential, sullied by an unsatisfactory ending and characters with story arcs so flat you could level a foundation with them.
