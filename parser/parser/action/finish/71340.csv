												Sonic Generations is a blend of two games. The old school original Genesis 2D platformers that have you speeding through winding labyrinths. The other half has more modern Sonic games that are not only 2D platformers, but 3D platformers and straightaway running in 3D. After completing the first level as old school (classic) Sonic, you're treated to a story cut scene. The game then game opens up to the platforming hub level. The hub level lets you switch between the two versions of Sonic. Levels are full of loops, straightaways, platforms, rails to grind on, tubes to shoot down like Sonic 2's bonus round, spikes, death pits, water, red rings that will launch Sonic and many paths here and there. While Sonic can't swim, he just jumps higher underwater when he used to just move slow in previous games. The levels are throwbacks to previous Sonic games. Consider it a best of collection.The game consists of three major chapters. Every chapter has 3 zones. Each zone has two levels (acts), the first level is that straight up 2D platformer and the second level is the more modern 3D version. You can tackle them in any order that you like. Once an act is complete, you rescue one of Sonic's many friends. After you complete the 6 levels of each chapter, then challenges become unlocked. Each zone has 5 challenges for each version of Sonic. 3 keys will also appear in each chapter and unlock when you complete one challenge from a zone. Then if you have 3 keys in one chapter, you can use them to unlock the boss for that chapter.The challenges offer some variety with objectives. For the most part you're just running through the same levels you had to get through to unlock them. There are a few unique levels in the challenges. The challenges range from beat the clock, racing tails in a plane, racing your own doppelganger (ghost), timed drifts, enemies moving at double speed and completing a level with only one ring. Since you rescue Sonic's many friends, there are special levels that make use of them to help Sonic. Amy Rose has a hammer that if you time it correctly you can do a mega jump. Knuckles will dig up medals for levels that you need X number of medals to complete the challenge. Rogue will charm armored enemies so Sonic can defeat them. Every enemy that gets defeated in her level makes hollow blocks into solid ones. It feels like a way to make a 4 hour game into an 8 hour game.Not only does every chapter have a boss, but there are also mini bosses. Basically you walk up to them in the hub level and challenge them. Once they're defeated, you get yourself a chaos emerald since there are no bonus levels like previous Sonic games. Each boss is original and unique, since Sonic has so many characters, you'll never fight the same one twice. The main bosses are gigantic. To take them down, its not just hitting a boss, but its timing the attacks when bosses are vulnerable and the way you'll need to make them vulnerable.Since it is like two games in one, there are two sets of controls. The old school sonic that has just a jump button. Who can duck and hit the button to start a spin dash that he'll release when you let go of down. Then there's the modern sonic that has the same controls for the most part. Modern Sonic has a homing attack that will lock onto an enemy, springboard or claw and dart to them in mid air. This helps with traversing the land as its a lot quicker than loading up a spin dash. Sonic can now slide under objects as he runs, but it feels more like a quick time event than anything. There are even level specific controls like wall jumping back and forth. Sonic will even find a way to make him stick to walls and ceilings.There is also a boost button that will send Sonic instantly dashing. The boost has a meter that decreases over time. To get boost you will need to collect rings. You can also get boost from drifting around corners when you're in a straightaway by holding the L or R when you go into turns. On top of that, you can gain boost by jumping through rainbow rings that will let you do mid air tricks by hitting the left thumbstick. Comparing the two control types feels like old school Sonic is one dimensional. This could be a subtle way of proving which character is better.The Sonics also have skills that you can use to customize them. Things like stopping on a dime no matter how fast you're going. Getting an extra life when you run out. Not taking fall damage and so on. There are even skills just for classic Sonic and others just for modern Sonic. Each skill you unlock uses points. You have 100 points to assign the skills. So the better the skill, the less others you can assign. There are loadouts too for quick assigning.As always rings are like Sonic's health. If you have a ring, Sonic can take a hit from an enemy or spikes. That will send the rings spraying from his body. If you don't have a ring when Sonic gets hit, he loses a life. The game's helper even announces it.  The game's helper is a big help, especially with the challenges. The helper will explain everything as you play including how to defeat the bosses. You can of course turn the helper off.Sonic Generations puts a real emphasis on speed more than the original Genesis games. The boosts, the loops, the bosses chasing you, a semmi truck trying to ram you, competing against doppelgangers. It all goes to prove that Sonic is fast if not parkour with his homing attack. At the end of each level and challenge, you get graded with par times. It almost feels like a racing game disguised as a platformer.The game is beautiful, but it feels like a beast on my system, causing me to lower resolution. Every blade of grass gets rendered and everything is colorful. The only problem is Sonic is super small on the screen. He gets dwarfed by how gigantic the world is around him and the camera never really being tight up on him. As everything blurs from the speed its easy to lose sight of him in 2D. Because of this, some of the game felt to me like it was playing itself. Even the quick time slides still made Sonic slide when I failed to push a button. Not holding the thubstick still made him move. Some of it gets relegated to timing homing attacks to get over areas. Is that a bad thing? No its visually impressive even if I don't feel like I have complete control.Another problem in the 3D worlds is no camera control. You're stuck looking at what the game wants you to. While that's not always a bad thing, it can be problematic. Sometimes I lost sight of Sonic or couldn't see a gap between areas sending into death pits. There were plenty of times in 3D terrain I jumped to my death. Often from misjudging where I was or from Sonic's slippery turnarounds. Often times Sonic would stop in mid air to fall to his death even having full momentum into a jump. Using boost to run over water is treacherous. Even in what looks like ankle deep water can send Sonic to his doom if you get clipped by a platform and stopped.There are plenty of extras to unlock including artwork, music that you can select to replace the current level music. It is a lot of content with 18 levels, skills, 90 challenges. For me it felt like the fun didn't last as long as the challenge. The death pits and water deaths seemed too constant. Even with a few glitches here and there, the game is by no means bad. It is just trying to be everything at once. Playing the classic Sonic feels forced when modern Sonic has so much diversity. I'd rather play one or the other.  To get to a destination, I can drive a car. Then I can flatten the tires and drive for 5 minutes. After that I can fill up the tires again. Then flatten the tires again after 10 minutes and fill up the tires again. I'll still get to my destination, but I'd rather not have flat tires from level to level. I would have appreciated if the game had two halves. If only you could complete a classic half and a modern half, without completing them both at the same time.			",1125,324,51,104,96,15,167

												This is one of the best Sonic games i have ever played. Much better than recent Lost World. Seemingly just typical PC version platformer, this game has everything that made console ports awesome: satisfying gameplay, great visuals, cool atmosphere, catchy music and some of the very best level design franchise had ever had. On top of that, replay value is top notch, and game constantly rewards players after every collectible and bonus level.Though, all of those bonus levels aren't fun, and bosses are sort of letdown too, weakest area of the game being the story... i mean... bunch of cutscenes. Extra levels have their moments, some of them being equal to main levels, but many also turn out frustrating, gimmicky and boring. Bosses have moments too, but they are mostly just simple gimmicks. Cutscenes are, however, total missopportunity. Also, take note on length, which depends on how much you want to come back to replay game, or beat friends records online. Also, incredibly weak pinball DLC.What makes this version best, is the fact that good computer runs it on amazing framerate. Mod support deserves big note here, good ones already existing, new amazing ones still coming. And never have mods been so user friendly or safe to use. That alone adresses lenght issue.Sonic Generations is not just good Sonic game, this is worthy purchase for all those in need of satisfying, arcade-ish platformer. No other series has seen such an significant step-up for sake of anniversary game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Summary: Sonic Generations is a nostalgic trip with a modern gaming twist celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Blue Blur himself, Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic and friends are tossed into the void between time and space itself by some mysterious figure known as the time eater, with Sonic and Tails meeting up with their past selves, save their friends, and make time itself whole again. Relive new representations of the classic levels you know and love, as well as BETTER representations from less than stellar sonic installments, and celebrated the Gaming icon's 20th birthday!Story/Plot/Setting: Not much to say here in terms of the story itself. In contrast to the more serious approach to storytelling that the series was originally trying (and failing at in this writer's opinion), the story is more lighthearted and simplified. Sonic and friends are caught in the white void between space and time by a foe known as the time eater. Since I try to write without giving away spoilers, I will say that for the most part, the story works in a way simply to push the game along and I feel this does it very well. The flow of the story is never bland, but most of it is driven along just to give a point to what you're doing. Even then, things are mostly there... just because. This isn't a detriment at all to the game itself, though, but if you're expecting a magnificent narrative meant to make you think, you may want to look elsewhere. Regardless, what is there has a great flow to it, so you never feel lost as to what is going on. You may shake your head a couple of times when the characters try to figure out what exactly is happening when you've figured it out practically from the start, but other than that I don't have anything to complain about.Gameplay/Content/Controls: Gameplay is where this game shines. The gameplay of Classic Sonic will bring you a nice nostalgia trip if you've played the Sonic games from the Sega Genesis/Megadrive era. I'm even amazed that his physics feel so familiar to that era as well. Since I've been a fan of Sonic since his first release on the Genesis, I was happy to see how well he was handled. The level design for classic sonic, though in a 3D style, are still handled like a 2D side scroller. This is in contrast to modern sonic level design, which share 2D and 3D segments. Modern Sonic's gameplay will feel familiar and probably much more comfortable than before if you've played Sonic Unleashed or Sonic Colors (I've only played Unleashed, but I'm aware that the basic gameplay of Colors is similar), as the concept is the same. It feels the most solid in this installment. Speed is handled incredibly well, never feeling completely on rails. With both sonics you'll find branching paths, threatening enemies, and several ways you can easily screw up if you aren't paying attention. There's challenge, but it never feels difficult to finish a level. The only time I felt frustrated was with the Modern version of the Sonic 2006 level, Crisis City.Speaking of the levels, each is one taken from a major installment of the sonic franchise, with the exception of Sonic CD, which was represented by the Metal Sonic Rival Battle in Stardust Speedway bad future. In addition to the levels themselves, you have a multitude of challenges that you can do as both Classic and Modern sonic. While you're only required to do one challenge for each stage represented to get keys to unlock the boss fight, it would worth your while as a sonic fan to do the others, as you can unlock more songs as well as artwork from the series as a whole. Plus most of the challenges are pretty fun, so you'd be doing yourself a disservice just simply skipping over them. If you do, however, it won't take you long before you beat the game. You could easily finish Generations within about four or five hours depending on quickly you get comfortable with the gameplay. The challenges can add on a few more hours of gameplay, as classic and modern sonic have twenty seven challenges each, making that a total of fifty four challenges you can do if you'd like. Since this was a 2011 release, the price now might entice you to buy it. But I would still recommend this is worth it at its original retail price if you've been a big fan of the Sonic series as I have been.Although I have praised the controls for the most part, there are two problems I need to point out. On the PC version of Generations, I noticed a weird but occasional issue with button response while using a controller. Quite a few times I noticed that Sonic would refuse to jump or do his homing attack. What's even weirder is that I could not emulate the issue, so it has nothing to do with character animations negating button presses. My controller has also had no such issues with bad response when I used it on other games as well, so I don't believe my controller to be malfunctioning. I don't remember having this issue when I originally played this game on the XBox 360, so if this issue turns you off to the game, consider looking for it on console.My other issue with regards to controls is the final boss fight, as well as segments where Sonic is either flying or falling. These segments have incredibly floaty mechanics, requiring you to negate your inertia in one direction in order to start going into the direction you want. While these segments are rare, it makes the final boss incredibly frustrating and almost killed my enjoyment of the game. Thankfully it didn't, as my experience with the rest of the game was just too good.Sound and Music: I can safely say this is a shining put of this game. All sound effects are impactful, make sense, and truly immerse you in the experience. And the music. Oh wow the music. Each stage contains remixed versions of their music, which they took very seriously to still fit the mood of the stage while at the same time feeling familiar to their original iteration. You can also unlock more songs through the challenges, which you can use to replace music in any stage, boss fight, or challenge you'd like. My only gripe is that you can't do this with the default stage songs as well. Graphics: On PC, you won't find the game to play any better at max settings than you would on the Console versions, but the game still looks very nice. As a 2011 release, the game still looks very aesthetically pleasing even today in 2015. I feel that this is due in large part to the art style, which has also stood the test of time. So if you want a pretty looking game, then look no further.Conclusion: Though a short game with a few control issues and a simple story, Sonic Generations proves to be a great game in and of itself. You can tell that the development team wanted this to be a Sonic game that was remembered in a good light, considering the unfortunate flops that the series has and continues to endure to this day. Though Console might be your best bet for this title, the PC version is still good enough to recommend if you don't have one. [Correction: There's actually 90 challenges total, not 54 like I originally stated.]			",129,9,1,2,5,0,1

												pros: the nostalgia is real, amazing soundtrack, two different sonic modes (one is 3D the other is original 2D sonic) which implements 2 ways to play levels, plenty of collectables, level challenges for dedicated players, a full cast of characters with a cheesy storyline that you would expectcons: you have to manually assign the keyboard buttons as a controller input (or just use ""default""), the game input indicators does not adapt to your custom inputs, game randomly crashes, 3D sonic has some awkward transitions from 3rd person-to-side screen views, camera angles often times work to your disadvantage resulting it ring loss & death, some levels are poorly designed, final boss battle was really clunkyOverall, if you are looking for a solid sonic experience on the PC platform then this is what you have been looking for. Although a subpar PC port, you can still manage to enjoy the game with keyboard and mouse. There are plenty of mods available to extend the games fun factor.Sonic Generations has my recommendation.

HowLongToBeat.com lists this game as taking five and a half hours to beat. Compare that to my playtime. I've gotten to the point where I can beat most levels in two or three minutes and I still keep going back to them. It's not a hugely challenging game but the experience of just running through the levels is delightful and relaxing while still demanding your attention to successfully complete. Shaving off seconds of your best time or just messing around and exploring the alternate paths makes for a fun distraction of an evening.I generally go back and replay Sonic 3 & Knuckles at least once a year. I love that game and it was by far my favourite in the franchise. I say was because Generations is now a very, very close second. Only the final boss - which, in contrast to the rest of the game, is a trainwreck - holds it back from the top spot.The nine levels from the game are taken from previous games. Revisiting some favourites from the old games is lovely, but these levels are great by themselves apart from the nostalgia factor. Each level is split into two acts, in the first you play as ""Classic Sonic"" who is styled after Sonic's sprites from the very first game. He handles very much like the Mega Drive games with only minor differences in physics (though his spin dash has been upgraded to the point of being almost hilariously powerful and fast) and really captures the old feel in a way that Sonic 4 absolutely did not.Also unlike Sonic 4 the game makes full use of its 3D environment while still playing entirely in 2D. The background scenery is gorgeous and used in ways that would not be possible in a fully 2D game.The 3D levels play like an amazing mix of standard 3D platformer, racing game and rhythm game. It moves much faster than the 2D sections but the forward facing camera allows you to see what's coming up ahead and react accordingly. This half of the game is much more dynamic with far more buttons on the controller being used as Sonic runs, jumps, boosts, slides, stomps, sidesteps and drifts through the levels.The levels, both 2D and 3D, are much more designed than those of the Mega Drive games. There is less general exploration and open areas than in the old games. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The rule of high route = fast and low route = slow is enforced strongly throughout the game. Failure to hit a jump correctly does not (usually) lead straight to a bottomless pit but instead to a lower path. These diverging paths periodically meet back up for the levels set pieces which provide some spectacle for the player before allows them to try and get to the top route again. It's a clear system that gives the player a goal on replays: Learn the top paths and get them down to a tee.There's also a variety of side missions for each level. Only 9 out of 90 need to be completed in order to beat the game, making them a nice mostly optional challenge for those who want to get a bit more out of it.The game features 7 boss battles which are all quite varied but all, apart from the atrocious final boss, are great fun.As for the story, there's thankfully not much of one.There's also some nice extra level mods for this game both released and on the horizon.I foresee myself replaying this game for a long time to come.

												☺ Brilliant side scrolling platforming.☺ Nostalgia filled.☺ Looks, runs and plays smooth.☺ Great soundtrack.☹ 3D platforming could be better.☺ Bosses are a bit of a let down.Recommended for everyone who enjoys solid Platforming games but especially fan's of Sonic's past games.(Note: This game was played with a controller).Sonic Generations is a wonderful game that celebrates Sonic's long gaming history while managing to provide something fresh and enjoyable. It's a real nostalgia filled treat as you travel to iconic zones from previous games in completely new levels that reimagine the classics with crisp visuals, an amazing soundtrack and faithful gameplay.There's a little something for all of Sonic's fans here, whether you started with the classics or are a newcomer to the series. The game features the blisteringly fast paced (but never uncontrollably so) sidescrolling platforming the series is known for, refined 3D levels that certainly feel better than previous games attempts, a multitude of ways to reach the goal that can keep replayabilty high, a new soundtrack that echo's the themes of previous games and a great deal of content to keep you busy for hours.As always, Dr Eggman (or Dr Robotnik to some) is up to his old tricks and in his attempts to stop Sonic once and for all, has brought chaos to the timelines bringing old and new together. You'll play as both the cute classic Sonic and the more lean modern Sonic in their attempts to stop him and restore the correct timeline. As well as the 9 main acts (18 levels) there are around 90 'challenges' that shake things up a bit, such as collecting a specific number of rings before you reach the goal or even calling on the aid of some familiar faces to help you out.While the sidescrolling platforming is among the best the series has to offer, the 3D platforming, while not bad, isn't quite up to the same quality. This is in part due to controls that can sometimes cause frustration and the overall lack of platforming as you simply slide from side to side as you hurtle forwards. Also of slight disappointment are some of the boss battles, most notably the final boss, which feel a bit out of place and are certainly not as fun as the old classics.Sonic Generations is quite the anniversary present that I'm sure will not only delight old fans but will likely create some new ones as well! While the game has a couple of missteps, it never falls flat on its face and remains an enjoyable experience from start to end - well recommended!			",718,180,15,118,69,6,141

Sonic Generations isn't the best Sonic game ever, but almost took the titleSonic Generations is, basically, a bomb of pure nostalgia.This game was made, mainly, for the fans, players who like platforming, fast-paced games, run through stages like there's no tomorrow, or just keep modding the game until it turns perfect (on the PC version, of course), for those kind of players, this game is very good, but for the fans, it's almost perfect.Awesome controls, awesome stage design, awesome models and animations, everything in this game is awesome, but like all the things in the universe, it's not perfect, some few bugs, very tiny bugs, will occur sometimes, but nothing that a ""Start Over"" won't solve, like in the Shadow Rival Battle, when Shadow keeps running into the wall, it's almost impossible for this to happen.The stages from past games that were remade to Sonic Generations, were very well chosen,  highlighting Classic Crisis City, the troll stage, along with 4 bosses, one from each era of Sonic The Hedgehog series, and one just for Sonic Generations, and 3 Rival Battles.The soundtrack... well... it's just... perfect! Hear the new Escape From the City remixes it's a holy sound to everybody's ears, highlighting Modern Rooftop Run, my favorite from the entire soundtrack.The modding community just turns the PC version even better, with new stages, other Sonic series characters, even characters that are not from the series. Dario ff/Samothethief and the Team Unleashed made a flawless job with the ""Unleashed Project"" a mod that adds all the main day stages from Sonic Unleashed, this mod it's just perfect for the people who played Sonic Unleashed and liked it.And now... for the thing:Pros:-Awesome graphics-Easy controls for both Sonics-Nostalgia bomb-Flawless soundtrack-Well done stages-Easter eggs  (Most of them are on the Adventure Era) -The price.Cons:-Almost no challenge.-Easy stages and bosses, if you're an expert in Sonic games, don't do normal mode, go on Hard mode.-Very short game, you can finish it in 2-4 hours.-Just Classic and Modern Sonic as playable characters.""Sonic Generations is a epic game, it is an awesome game on it's own, with mods, it's even better, i am a huge Sonic The Hedgehog fan, and i'm proud that i bought this game""[/h1][/b]9.0/10 - Rick The Hedgehog ",47,2,2,4,1,2,0

YouTube™ Video: Sonic Generations Review 

			Views: 176		

			We take a look at the platforming adventure game; Sonic Generations...If only SEGA was this good every time. http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

Something old and something new; you get the best of both worlds in Sonic Generations. SEGA proves that Sonic the Hedgehog can still remain relevant in the platforming genre that has been mostly dominated by fat Italian plumbers. With decade’s worth of nostalgia and fan service being crammed inside the title of “Generations” is truly fitting. The game focuses on playing as both a side scrolling “Classic” Sonic that plays like Sonic from the Sega Genesis and then 2D/3D style “Modern” Sonic which plays like Sonic Colors or Sonic Unleashed. The game offers some of the finest platforming (both 2D and 3D) that you’ll be able to find on the PC. Many often criticize sonic games by complaining about the “speed” of Sonic the Hedgehog and that when playing he doesn’t feel fast enough, or that they make him too fast and the platforming isn’t enjoyable, Sonic Generations finds that perfectly happy medium between speed and platforming, It is incredibly fast paced but it doesn’t force you to go insanely fast if you don’t want to, if you want to take your time and try to gather all the collectibles it gives you the option to do so. If you’ve ever played any of the games from either era of Sonic then you will be right at home with the combat system, either jumping on heads or using a spin attack as “Classic” Sonic, or flying through the air using homing attacks as “Modern” Sonic. Both the combat and platforming controls feel tight, fast, and fluid, it handles just the way a sonic game should. The game also periodically shakes things up by adding in fairly interesting boss battles that are each centered on a different type of combat component that you haven’t previously experienced in the game prior.Sonic Generations is quite the visually stunning game, the game looks absolutely gorgeous, especially the redesigned HD versions of classic Sonic levels. And the 60 FPS of the PC version makes the game feel and run buttery smooth, which is an absolute must for game that revolves around moving at such a high level of speed. The game also boasts an impressive soundtrack featuring a plethora of some of the greatest hits from Sonic games.The main story sadly only takes around 5-6 hours to complete, However despite the fairly short campaign, Sonic Generations is crammed to the brim with unlockables, collectibles, game modes and challenges that will easily put your play time into the double digits if you tried to 100%. Don’t let the short campaign scare you off, even if you’re the type of gamer who likes to do a single play through and be “one and done” ,Sonic Generations is a high enough quality game to warrant spending at that type of price to gameplay hours ratioOverall the game shows that Sonic still has what it takes to be a powerhouse of the platforming genre, offering fast fluid controls, amazing level design, beautiful visuals, an incredible soundtrack and enough fan service to make any devote Sonic worshipper cry tears of joy. The only downside of the game is that by the time you beat it you’ll still want more. http://noobsthatplaygames.com/ ",373,80,9,49,38,4,45

												If you were ever a fan of the Master System/Megadrive Sonic games, then this game might actually please you. If your more familiar with the newer sonic games then this game delivers in that area too. The 2D and 3D elements of sonic have been merged together to create a game that caters for all and does it well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sega surprisingly did a really good job with this game.Sonic Generation, a game created for celebrate the 20 years of the good ol' hedgehog.Pretty much the same gameplay mechanic as the most recent Sonic games, like Sonic Colors, but still really enjoyable and fun to play.The animations are really amazing and well done, same for the environments, that of course, it's all styled as the past Sonic's games.Some stages might be really frustrating, but probably it was just me, playing this game on a keyboard. Get a controller for this game, really makes everything more easy to play.The real great thing of this game is the soundtrack: all styled as the old and fantastic Sonic's soundtracks, they know how to bring you back. Also, if you move around really fast in the main zone where you have to choose the stage, you can hear how they timed them to make an infinite song with all the background ones. It's amazing.My final Score: 8/10Get this game, you won't regret it.			",488,143,14,45,39,6,32

												I am a huge Sonic fan. I stopped buying Sonic games after Unleashed for some reason. I did feel excited to buy new Sonic games. When I joined Steam, I realized that Sonic CD, a game I never played is on Steam. I got the game and enjoyed it. This inspired me to check out the other Sonic games. Sonic Racing Transformed and Sonic Generations were looking good for the reviews.I tried out Generations and oh my God, this game is AMAZING. I love how they incorporate a zone from the past Sonic games and remastered them into two Acts: 2D and 3D. I love how they made a distinct clear of differences in zones and abilities between Modern Sonic and Classic Sonic.Classic Sonic is the original Sonic moveset with no homing attack or speed boost. You play him in a remastered version.This game is full set on nostalgia for old Sonic fans, visiting each level reminding them what made Sonic to Sonic as of today.It is short but has a lot of replayability			",208,28,4,32,18,2,11

												People may like to hate on the modern Sonic games (and usually for good reason), but Sonic Generations deserves no such hate. This game is an absolute blast for any Sonic fan to play! The game’s premise is you and the yesteryear Sonic the Hedgehog have to rescue all their old worlds they have been to. This means every iteration in the main Sonic line is represented with a level in the game! From Chemical Plant, to City Escape, it’s nice to go back and play all these classic levels. The gameplay is much improved over the more recent Sonic games so no worries there. The music in the game is spectacular, and I have already downloaded the soundtrack onto my computer. This is actually the second time I have played through Generations and I can assure you it is just as much fun as the first. Only thing I miss is the surprise of which classic level is next.I recommend any Sonic fan, platforming fan, or video game fan in general to pick this up. I promise you that you will love this game as much as I do! ",83,28,4,11,17,2,11

												Pros:-You have both types of Sonic gameplay (Oldschool and Modern).-The stages are fun, unique, nostalgic and provide with a decent challenge.-A new skill system which provides a little depth to Sonic.Cons:-The game is short, even for a Sonic game.-The final boss battle is lackluster.-It is a huge shame that you can't play as the other Sonic characters such as Shadow, Knuckles, Blaze etc.			",35,7,2,6,4,1,5

												Probably one of my favourite platformers ever. Possibly one of the best Sonic games ever, a very fun game that i recommend everyone to buy. If you dont like the 3D then play 2D and vise versa.Plus theres a load of mods to add previous Sonic games levels into it and other characters. The modding community is very much still alive.

												How do you define a good Sonic game?The series was struggling with the right answer for this question. The Sonic Generations attempt was one of the last possible calls for SEGA to do things right and... they succeeded! This game single-handedly revived the franchise for me and gave me the kick to check out the old classics for the first time (I'm the Dreamcast Kid). This game is really this good!Imagine that the famous band tries to set up ""The Best of..."" album. They take one song from each previous album. Some of those releases were horrible and you think: ""Remaking this track is a bad idea! This was a dark age for this band!"". You are relieved when you notice that the ""that one"" dreaded song sounds so new and fresh! Even more... you notice that every song has one version for the original vocalist and second for the new one that came into band recently. This is Sonic Generations in nutshell. They took a level from every single game in the main series and remade them to fit for both: the old and cute Classic Sonic with 2D gameplay and the Modern Sonic with the boost mechanic. Fear Sonic '06 no more! Crisis City in this game better than ever! And you can cure your PTSD from the Silver boss fight here! Don't like him? IT'S NO USE! He will suffer and you will be satisfied! I think that the good Sonic game is the one with the good controls and clever level design. While the controls of the Modern Sonic aren't still at the level of Sonic Adventure's one they are acceptable. Classic Sonic rolls and hops nearly just like in the Genesis era, only with few inconsistencies.The level design in this game is near GORGEOUS. They look extremely well and they are designed around the idea of the multiple paths in the single level. There is still one start point and one goal post, but there are many routes for the run through the stage. The exploration is highly rewarded by the Red Star Rings that are layed on the different pathways in the level. You may find yourself replaying the level multiple times to finally reach the highest, fastest and the most skillful route. Even when Modern Sonic still has the Boost Button, the levels have much more platforming this time around and it is not bad implemented. This level design single handedly makes up for the all replayability of the game - just look at my playtime.The graphics are... oh my... they are outstanding. The Surreal Realism fits the series like a glove. There are pretty water effects, plants and locations and yet still the game have a incredible, cartoony artstyle. Unfortunely, this game really needs a good computer to run smoothly, but if you have a nice power PC, 60 FPS in this game and the art style will make you laugh on the nice visually but weak artistically games like Crysis. Soundtrack of this game is a pack of music all well known to the fans of the series handled with the nice remixes. ""Escape from the City""? ""Live and Learn""? Crisis City Stage music? Chemical Plant? Awesome disco remix for the ""Classic"" Speed Highway? Do want!Controller is a must here... Sorry keyboard-exclusive guys. Story is kinda weak too. Don't buy this game for the SA2-like story. You won't find it here. The nods to the previous games are fun, but the writing and plot is nearly non-existent. The online mode is very buggy and may crash your game when you are attempting to unlock the achievement. Final boss fight is not well designed and Side-missions are hit or miss, but still, I was happily to finish this game on 100%. 4 times.This is a extremely solid 3D platformer. This is one of the few Sonic games that I would easly recommend to the people who are not fond with the series yet. This is really a high note in the franchise and you are really missing out if you put a fold on it. It is definitely not perfect with various bugs, weak story and the short playthrough, but the replayability, level design and the presentation is top notch.Side note: kids REALLY like this game! Tested on several individuals during the babysitting. It may be too hard for the less skilled, but with supervising parent this will be a really good time!			",168,39,11,6,6,2,16

												Rating: 8/10Overview: 2D and 3D PlatformerThe Good:+ Every level features bright, vibrant colors that distinguish itself from every other level.  + The game features 9 levels. Each level is split between a traditional 2d platformer and a more modern 3d platformer giving you a total of 18 levels. The levels are chosen from the sonic universe. + Every level is designed with multiple pathways providing replayability  + Achievements are easy to obtain although some can be a bit time consuming. + Plenty of mods The AverageThe game really requires a controller After completing levels, challenges become available allowing you to replay certain sections of the level with certain requirements i.e. finish the race before the npc does, collect a certain amount of rings etc. The problem is these are not very challenging and does very little to change up the gameplay in any meaningful way. These challenges feel repetitive, however they are also completely optional unless you want the achievement. The game is very short and easy, if you stick to the main content of the game you are looking at about 4-6 hours of gameplay depending on skill level. Going for achievements will extend your gameplay timeThe camera angles and controls for the modern levels can be a bit frustrating at times. As you complete levels/defeat bosses and collect red coins throughout the levels, you unlock skills that can be purchased from a shop. You can then equip different skills that fit your playstyle. These skills are optional and didn't  have a  major impact on gameplay. You could just as easily complete the game with no skills as you could with some of the more useful ones. Certain skills are nice to have but didn't have a big impact on gameplay.  The Bad:-The game crashed a lot especially when you play online. -The story is pretty terrible but can easily be skipped. Regardless, you are not playing this game for the story anyways. ConclusionThis is my first modern sonic game I've played and from what I've been told it is also the best. This game is really well made and a lot of fun if you are a fan of platformers. I really loved the diversity in the levels as well as the design. Going through the levels again but taking a different path really highlighted how well designed some of these levels are. I recommend this game if you are a fan of platformers.

												This game is awesome. 10/10It does, however, have some bad technical issues and as such requires a very fast computer to run. Despite that however, there are only a few bugs and this is definitely the best 3d sonic game thus far, barring the sonic stages from SADX/maybe SA2. Even if you can't run this, I beg you to pick up a copy on the 360, however I wouldn't recommend it otherwise as this game has a large and awesome modding community that greatly expands the game's length with level mods. Oh, and the Unleashed Project should have a permanent home on your hard drive.			",277,24,9,18,27,3,23

The Good. Smooth framerates through the entire game even on this 5 year old mid-tier computer. It's a pretty game, simple as that. Modern Sonic feels as good as ever. The Music is amazing allthough most of the tracks are remixes that isn't necessarily a bad thing but there's a few tracks that isn't my style at all (I'm looking at you City Escape -_-') Simple and intuitive progression through the game (Except for the mini-challanges). The modding community has given this game a second lifewith a special mention going out to the Unleashed Project.  The Concept Art with included notes (in english). Didn't crash a single time throughout the entire game.The Bad. Classic Sonic feels better than in Sonic 4: Episode 1 but it's still not hitting the spot just yet. The time it takes to complete the story-mode levels is abit on the low side. The ""Storyline"": there isn't much of a story at all. I didn't enjoy the small challange levels and I would rather have paid for the Unleashed-project to be included in the game with proper progression support instead. I didn't find the power-ups on Planet Wisp to be enjoyable but they are working and not really frustrating. The Quicktime moments were not up to par with other recent Sonic games.The Ugly. No native support for the PS4-controller and setting it up so it actually works has to be done with third party software as far as I know. I used the program TocaEdit X360 Controller Emulator. On several occations the game didn't register jump presses which is a big thing in a game that is supposed to ""go fast"". This is something that happens with both classic and modern Sonic. (this might have something to do with the PS4-controller thing i mentioned above or that my computer is old.) The Level Crisis City has 2 horrible game elements for Classic Sonic which I personally think is a big no-no!Winds blowing at a constant speed against you at the end part of that level, combine that with the unresponsive controls from time to time and you'll be falling into a pit of death more often than not.The Fire tornados on that map is abit sketchy and I think its hard to see if i'm going to get insta-killed or if i'm actually gonna make it.The Verdict.6/10I still think that it's a bit much for a game that you run through in a few hours without any other supporting content to back the game up. Get Sonic Unleashed or Sonic Heroes instead.  ",134,30,2,4,12,3,9

												Sonic the Hedgehog has not had the most celebrated of careers. While his early games are regarded as iconic and influential, an amazing run of mostly bad games in latter years reduced SEGA's mascot to little more than an irrelevant joke. At that point, there's only one thing to do -- release a ""best of"" compilation!Sonic Generations takes a number of the very best stages from across Sonic's 20-year history, as well as a few of the not-so-good, and completely remakes them with new content. Furthermore, a second hedgehog is along for the ride, but it's not some horrible silver one from the future!What could go wrong with any of that?Sonic Generations (PC [reviewed])Developer: Sonic TeamPublisher: SEGAReleased: November 1, 2011MSRP: $49.99. Now $29.99Sonic Generations teams Sonic the Hedgehog up with none other than Sonic the Hedgehog -- the long-legged Sonic of recent years comes face to face with his pot-bellied past self. When a grinning monster called the Time Eater starts ripping through reality, elements of Sonic's past become erased and the two hedgehogs cross paths. Naturally, it's up to our furry duo to save the day. By racing through famous Sonic stages at top speed, ""Modern"" and ""Classic"" Sonic are able to put time back on track and end the Time Eater's mysterious plans. It's not exactly the most sensible of stories, but it's certainly no worse than what we've seen in recent Sonic titles. Packing plenty of self-referential jokes and a glorious ""twist"" at the end, it's at least an entertaining little adventure. There are nine main chapters, each based on well-known stages in Sonic history. From Green Hill Zone all the way to Planet Wisp, every console era has been represented quite nicely. Every chapter has a ""Classic"" and ""Modern"" variant, with Classic Sonic dashing across sidescrolling platform levels and Modern Sonic racing through 3D-oriented stages. To progress through the game, you'll need to play each stage with both Sonics, making for 18 stages in total. Classic Sonic is presented almost exactly as he was in his Genesis heyday. The spin dash is back as well as Sonic's inability to home in on enemies -- he'll need to manually bounce on their heads. His stages, slower-paced than the Modern levels, focus on intricate, old-school platforming. The only modern concession is the ability to automatically spin dash with the press of a button, something the purists may hate but that I find aids the flow of the game. If it's a big deal, one can easily spin dash the old-fashioned way by ducking and hammering the jump button.For nostalgic fans, Classic Sonic is a pleasant return to form. However, there seems to be a problem with his jumping as many of the platforms are far-flung, making crossing wider gaps feel unnecessarily tricky. Either Sonic Team needed to make him able to jump further or these platforms should have been brought closer together. It's not like any of the jumps are completely impossible, but they can get exasperating if one doesn't nail a running leap absolutely perfectly.It also doesn't help that the game has a habit of placing enemies just far enough across from gaps that Sonic will land on the ground and uncurl a split-second before he touches them, consequently taking damage. These instances feel like real cheap shots that, while not severely damaging to progress, grow increasingly annoying, especially in the latter stages where this issue becomes more rampant. In truth, I have to admit that the Modern Sonic levels are actually more fun. While there are some truly enjoyable 2D stages, the contemporary variants are almost always more exhilarating thanks to their sheer intensity. Such highlights include an explosive new take on the Chemical Plant Zone and an utterly gorgeous Speed Highway level. All told, there are surprisingly few duds compared to the overwhelming majority of bad levels seen in most of the recent titles. That isn't to say that duds aren't there, of course. Seaside Hill is a sloppy mess of awfully designed platforming and Planet Wisp is repetitive and slow. As for Crisis City? The fact that it was allegedly a highly demanded level only seems to prove just how demented the Sonic fanbase has become, since it's still the same sprawling mass of ill-placed chasms and confused homing targets that it always was. Still, I remain shocked by the fact that the ratio of good to bad stages is stacked in favor of the positive, marking a revolutionary step forward for Sonic's retail outings. As well as the main stages, our two heroes will need to undertake ""Rival"" battles against some famous Sonic characters -- Metal Sonic, Shadow the Hedgehog, and Silver the Hedgehog. These are part-combat, part-racing engagements, with a designated Sonic running to avoid the enemy's attacks before hitting him when he's vulnerable. Each Rival challenge is surprisingly intense and represents some of the more gratifying moments in the game -- especially when giving Silver his well-deserved beatdown. Every main stage also has a series of challenge courses to complete, and while most of them are optional, Sonic Team couldn't resist making the completion of at least a few of them compulsory. Fortunately, players will only ever need to complete one challenge from each stage in order to progress through the game, and they can choose whatever one they want using whichever Sonic they're most comfortable with.Challenges come in many flavors. Some of them are races against doppelgangers, others require a certain amount of rings to be collected, and others make use of Sonic's furry friends to complete obstacle courses. Although based on the main stages, many of these challenges are fully realized levels in their own right, some managing to be exceedingly inventive. There's even a stage where you can summon Tails and use him to fly around a 2D Chemical Plant, just like in the Genesis days!Skill Points are earned via successful completion of a stage or challenge, then they can be spent on minor enhancements to the hedgehogs. These include increased speed, improved ability to collect lost rings, and even power-ups based on classic Sonic abilities, such as the bubble shield seen in Sonic the Hedgehog 3. A wide variety of music can be unlocked and used in any stage -- you've not truly experienced the game until you've played a level with ""Sonic Boom"" blasting in the background!Rounding out the package, there are four bosses, each positioned after three levels and pertinent to a certain ""era"" of the franchise -- Death Egg Robot for Genesis, Perfect Chaos for Dreamcast, and Egg Dragoon for this generation. They feature new twists on famous fights and can be pretty damn epic in scale, though sometimes vague on what you're actually supposed to do. As a cohesive package, fans tired of bad Sonic games can't help but be impressed by what's on offer. The only consistent issue is that it can be hard to recalibrate one's brain when switching between Sonics, as the two distinct gameplay styles can become a little jarring. It's not uncommon to wonder why Classic Sonic isn't homing onto anything, or why Modern Sonic's jumps feel so unusual. After a few stages, the confusion abates, but instances of crossed wires may crop up now and then.Sonic Generations isn't a very long game -- it can be beaten in around five hours or so. Still, there's significant replay value not just in the optional challenges but also in simply replaying the main chapters. Quite a few of the levels are so much fun that they're worth multiple revisits, and I've found myself spending up to an hour at a time just beating stuff I've already played. Finding hidden stars to unlock music and artwork and attempting to gain an ""S"" rank in each stage provide lots of extra incentive as well.Nevertheless, it would have been nice to have had less optional challenges and more real chapters			",189,44,1,46,12,1,12

												Okay.  Some people are wondering ""how can she have so many hours on that game?""I'll tell you my secret:I'm always angry.Wait, no.  That's not right.The secret is that I own a small desk cycle I can put right at my feet.  So I pick up my controller and do time attacks in this game while I sweat out the cardio.  Makes for a great workout, cause of the sense of motion.  Working out the body, mind, and reflexes - ho!  I highly recommend it. This game, Gauntlet, and Dyad are my favorites for exercising.So that's the story.  Beyond that, I mean, it's the best Sonic game released since Sonic Adventure.  Honestly, it's better than Sonic Adventure, because it's purely Sonic play, none of this other character crap.  I play Sonic games to whiz through levels and be a blue badass, not flop around as corpulent purple cat and go fishing.  WTF, Sega.  Sometimes.  You guys. ",125,16,3,39,22,0,19

												This game rocks and I am glad I bought it on Steam, otherwise if I bought this on the 360 or PS3 then it be a waste as PS4 and XB1 says ""No"" to PS3 and 360 games. But if you got your 360 wired controller, you can actually play it as your PC Controller as both 360 and the PC are both made by Microsoft; unlike the old Microsoft SideWinder.Good thing with this game is you can play as Classic Sonic or Modern Sonic, and relive the nostaglic moments. Unlike the older Sonic Games near the DreamCast era that contain those awkward tasks, Sega managed to allow skill customisation to resolve hard to reach places for the Red Goal Rings.

												This is my favorite game. This was my first Sonic game and it led me to the Sonic Universe. It makes us [re]discover the best Sonic games. The graphisms are amazing and pretty colorful. The musics are awesome. The gameplay is nice but, I have an advice for all the players that complain about Sonic acceleration, you should  just use the acceleration skill and you will see the difference. The difficulty can be define as ""Somewhat OK"", some levels are a bit vicious when you do them for the first time. However the notation system at the end of each act is really kind with the player. You can get an S on somemap without using the Boost a single time. You see, others Sonic games got a very strict system and you can get a D [#NoJokeOK] for making a good work, like Sonic Adventure 2. Don't forget this is a easily ""moddable"" game, you'd better look the community mods and start playing with other characters like Silver or Blaze.→ 97/100			",17,1,2,1,2,1,0

												Sonic Generations is a game I never got to play back when it came out. I never had a 3DS, Xbox 360, or PS3, and I never knew about Steam, so I honestly wasn't able to play it. But now I have a 3DS and this game, and it is Awesome! This game is literally one of the Fastest Sonic Games to date! I'm glad I bought this game on Steam, because if I hadn't, I wouldn't have met some really cool friends in Time Attack. However, I didn't have an Xbox 360 Controller so I was stuck with the Keyboard, so make sure you get an Xbox 360 or PS3 Controller hooked up to your PC.Controls: PC: 6/10Xbox 360/PS3: 9/10Graphics: 8/10Sound: 9.5/10Gameplay: Gets repetitive at times. 8.5/10Average Rating: 8.2/10Go buy it if you missed out on the Xbox 360 or PS3 Release.

												I haven't played any recent Sonic titles but I'm well aware of the criticisms they have received as far as bugs, camera angles and unoriginality are concerned. I went into Sonic Generations with an open mind, but with awareness that I might be disappointed. Thankfully I can say that all my concerns were for naught. In short, I have had an absolute blast playing Generations, far more than I expected.The 2D levels are a great trip into nostalgia as well as providing new experiences for me. I've only played one 3D sonic game and that was about 12 years ago. Some infrequent camera issues aside caused by intense speeds, I haven't had any struggles at all with the 3D levels. The music is fantastic, I especially love the modern Chemical Plant Zone, Crisis City and Rooftop Run tracks (the latter of which is currently stuck in my head). There is also surprisingly high amounts of customization in the skill system, something I didn't even know existed before playing. I can pick between many skills to suit my gameplay needs such as recovery abilities or a single choice of a handful of powerful skills with gameplay changing impacts. Add in the fact that there are multiple challenges and collectibles for both zones  (evenly spread across 2D and 3D) as well as each level completion giving you ranks and the option to try to get the best possible rank for each zone and challenge and you'll find that for the completionist, there is a massive amount of content to be had. I figured I would pick the game up, do a quick run through and then never come back. Instead this has been my game of choice for the last two weeks and I still haven't reached the end (partly due to time constraints). This is a great game and lives up to the standards set by the Genesis era.			",346,110,11,48,36,5,38

												After Sonic the Hedgehog on the Genesis, I never really played Sonic games. I discovered this one on Extra Play and decided to give it a go. I really have to say that it's soooo good. Even though I grew up with Mario instead of Sonic, I really appreciate what Sega and the Sonic Team did here. That feeling of going fast is definitely addictive. Some time ago, I played Racing Transformed and was impressed of how much better I preferred that game over the Mario Kart and now I have to admit that this one is the - for me - the better jump and run as well.The only bad thing about this game: It made me realize that I had the wrong consoles on my wishlist when I was a child and therefore probably missed way too many great games :D.

												In short, Sonic Generations is definately worth your time.It combines elements of Sonic's past and Sonic's present and in the end product, I think it turned out really well.There are 2 playable characters. Classic Sonic, representing Sonic's earlier days and everything that made him great, and Modern Sonic, of course, representing his present form along with his developed personality.With the two playable characters come 2 different types of gameplay. 2D Side-scrolling action for the Classic fans, and 3D Third-person running for the Modern fans/While the story isn't heavily detailed or developed, there's a certain charm of seeing Modern Sonic team up with his past self running through stages.Modding plays a heavy rrole in this game's life-span. If you'd like additional stages, sound, character or music mods, you can easily access all of those online. (Though support isn't native)If you're a fan of either or both of Sonic's eras, this game is for sure something you'd be interested in.			",180,14,2,6,8,3,5

												 Most certainly one of the best Sonic games SEGA has managed to make. Beautiful graphics, smooth gameplay and physics, and a really wonderful soundtrack. Seeing all these Zones from past games both re-made and re-imagined set to a catchy and fitting remix of it's original song to go with the action (or even being able to change the song to your liking depending on what collectable music you've unlocked) is beyond perfect. Pretty sure my inner child brought out a tear to my eye when I started playing this and really felt invested into it. Though sadly I've seen the ending before playing it a few years ago since I didn't see myself buying it, I still plan on doing everything this game has to offer because of how happy I feel playing it. It's also plenty of fun to revisit stages, looking for new secrets and shortcuts to beat past records. Classic Sonic stages play smoothly with slightly tweaked physics when compared to the legitimate classics, and Modern Sonic's control like Sonic Colors but better basically. I recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the Blue Blur, it's a solid game that doesn't take long to beat, but has enough content to keep you playing and enough action to keep you running through Green Hill or various other stages over and over again.

												I will be reviewing this game in three categories:Gameplay - How are the controls? Is the gameplay fun? How about difficulty?Presentation - Is the sound cool? Does it look nice?Other - Miscellaneous detailsGameplay: 10/10Never in my life have I been blessed with outstanding gameplay. This is a Sonic game that lets you go fast. You're not wielding any weapons or riding vehicles or using gimmicky controls or anything like that. All you are doing in this game is platforming through some expertly designed levels at high speed. And it is awesome! There are two ""Acts"" in each stage. The first ""Act"" is a 2D section played as Classic Sonic. The physics and controls of Classic Sonic feel grand and superb. They get as close to the original control scheme as they can and allow you to just hold down a button to charge your spindash instead of mashing a button. The second ""Act"" is a 3D section played as Modern Sonic. The boost gameplay has never had better controls. Modern Sonic feels so nice to control and play, has the perfect blend of speed (much faster than Sonic Colours but more controllable than Sonic Unleashed) and just feels right! The difficulty is more on the easier side but the extra challenge gates are more than difficult enough for sonic veterans.Presentation: 9/10It's a Sonic game... the soundtrack is bound to be glorious. More accurately, though, the soundtrack has great original pieces, AMAZING remixes of past classics and will stick in your head for a long time to come. My personal favourites are both Classic/Modern Crisis City, Classic City Escape and Stardust Speedway-Bad Future JPN (Metal Sonic fight). The graphics are lush and do total justice to the previous games that Sonic Generations are referencing. There are so many little details and secrets in the landscapes that it almost makes me want to stop going fast so I can take it all in. Almost. The problem is that you go so fast you forget to appreciate the wonderful visuals.Other- There is a shop in the game where you can purchase extra skills that can enhance gameplay in the stages. Some of these skills include the three elemental shields (they even give you a modified double jump!) and an endless boost!- The bosses in this game are very fun to play. The only boss I don't like in this game is the final boss. It's so boring...- There is an online mode that you can attempt to try out. I say 'attempt' because it will more than likely kick you out of the game if you try to use it. Ouch.Result: 19/20For many it is the ""definitive Sonic game"". And can you really argue against that?! With fine-tuned gamplay, great visuals and a stellar soundtrack, this is a game that I recommend to newcomers and veterans alike. This game celebrated 20 years of Sonic being a fantastic franchise in our lives and delivering great content. Nowhere else do you see that more than in Sonic Generations.			",17,2,0,2,2,0,0

												Sonic Generations brought back feelings of nostalgia for me, by reminding me of times I played Sonic on the Sega Mega Drive and Dreamcast consoles. I found it reclaimed the fun and entertainment of previous Sonic titles by returning to the formula of simple and fast gameplay. Gameplay that had been lost in newer Sonic titles due to seemingly unresponsive controls and poorly introduced gimmicks.  If you had a childhood where you played Sonic I suggest you grab an ice cream, a bean bag, and a controller to really enjoy this one. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A Sonic game in 3D that's... good?  Well, you better believe it.  This version of Sonic is a hit, and not just because you can play 2D levels as well.  No, it is in fact the blend of these two dimensions that gives the game depth.  Neither seems to have to support the other, or make up for the other's shortcomings.  Instead, both play styles work together to form a cohesive, fun, and nostalgic run as our favorite blue speedster.  While some mini-levels shoe-horn in friend mechanics, the vast majority of the stages are inherently fun and offer a wide array of secrets for replayability.			",234,33,1,25,9,0,18

												Going into this i figured it would be just like every sonic game, The first level was fast and fun while giving you the impression that it would all be that way. However when playing this further i realized it is nothing like the others, Every level was enjoyable both Classic and Modern. Controls were a bit sticky feeling on Classic but that could of just been the program i'm using to emulate a Xbox360 Controller from a PS4 Controller. Gameplay - it's enjoyable and is definitely one of the better modern sonic games (Not a fan of the whole boost to win thing), Highly recommend this to current fans of Sonic and old Fans from the Classic Era.Story - It is kinda generic. Enemy attack, Sonic must save his friends, You defeat him in a Special Transformation... same thing as the last. However the way the story played out and the whole idea behind Classic Sonic was pretty cool.Features - This game is choked full of Secrets/Unlockables and to my surprise even had a few *only Unlocked through Codes* That you can find online... no games do that anymore, Last game i remember was Black Ops 2. You can unlock some of the BEST Sonic Songs in history, You can unlock artwork, Collect Statues, Replay all Cutscenes.   Possibly the best part about the Features in this game is that EVERY SONG can be added to any level at any time before playing it. You can beat a Boss then later replay that boss with *Live & Learn* instead, This added many hours of gameplay for me. I loved racing down a Modern City Escape with *Endless Possibilities* Playing.Mods - This game has many many MANY Mods, Sonic Team themselves even endorsed the idea of Mods in this game by allowing them. You have mods allowing you to play as Shadow on City Escape and instead of using a board you are riding his motorcycle from the game *Shadow the hedgehog*, all the way to playing as Silver or even changing the looks of Bosses. P.S. - Not sure about Mod Stages... have not gotten that far.For $20 i Definitely would recommend for old and new Fans of Sonic, Getting this on sale is a must if possible. 7.8/10			",117,22,2,14,5,0,5

(yes sad, not bad) - You see what Sega CAN do - You see how much cooler the classic Sonic was - You will see characters like Shadow, Knuckles and Metal Sonic, but well animated. That makes you want to play them, but you can't - Modern Sonic's last words to Old Sonic ""Hey Sonic! Enjoy your future! It's gonna be great!"" yes, fu SegaBad. - The whole last battle. Boring fight, boring Super Sonic´s and annoying friends - You unlock Super Sonic after the last fight. Cool?

												Sonic Generations is the ultimate love letter to any fan of Sonic the Hedgehog, new and old. The game is composed entirely of levels and music from 1991's Sonic the Hedgehog, to 2010's Sonic Colors, all redone and beautifully recreated. It's both a 2D and 3D platformer, and that's the gimmick here. You can play as ""Classic Sonic"" in Act 1 who's play style is exactly like a traditional 2D Platformer, and as ""Modern Sonic"" who's levels are 3D. Modern also has the boosting feature from Sonic Rush, and the Homing Attack, whilst Classic can just utilize the Spin Dash.As stated, all stages and music are completely re-done from the ground up to make up pretty interesting levels. But it's not just an HD makeover, every one of the levels have been edited to where it's different from the original game, while it still has those familiar bits here and there.The soundtrack is also beautiful. Every piece (Save 2 or 3 exceptions) is remixed Sonic music from the past, fitting with the old stages you play. Actually, it's remixed twice. Classic has more retro sounding music, and Modern has, well, you can put two and two together.Now where the problems lie, there are a couple. This one is pretty obvious, but if you're not the biggest fan of Sonic, this game might be pretty average to you. Don't get me wrong, the game is still a spectacular platformer, but the entire purpose was to celebrate Sonic's 20th anniversary, therefore it was made for the fans. Another issue is the game is really easy compared to most Sonic games, and platformers in general, and it doesn't take much effort to get an S rank on every mission, so that could also be a problem.In short, Generations is a wonderfully crafted Sonic game for the fans. If you love the hedgehog, definitely get this game, you won't regret it. If you're not a Sonic fan, it's still a good platformer for what it is, I think you'll still like it.			",213,33,2,19,7,3,12

												I discovered there were Sonic the Hedgehog games on Steam.I found Sonic Generations.I bought the game.I PLAYED THE GAME.I found out everyone lied on their reviews....I was stunned. There was no lag, the game looked beautiful, and the audio was perfect. I have 100% the game yet, since I can't find the red star rings in Planet Wisp. (Man  I hate that world) The story, MAN the story was good. It was worth buying this game AND an Xbox controller to play it. Now, you dont NEED the controller, but I found it easier to play with one.Now, without giving a ton of spoilers, I'll tell the story. It's Sonic's birthday and pretty much everyone but Shadow came to celebrate (because Shadow's a grump). But an evil shadow monster guy came and stole all of Sonic's friends because he wasn't invited. Sonic got knocked out and wakes up in the hub world. Now he has to save the day like the pro he his. But WAIT, there's more! What is this? TWO Sonics? And TWO Tails? W-wait... why two Tails?... IDK. Well, 7 or 8 stages aren't enough? How about two types of each stage! And old bosses! Want to beat up Shadow? Of course you do! Want to beat up Silver? Of course you don't but you're gonna do it anyways!So there's your ""what the heck"" summary of your story, because you're gonna play it and I wont spoil too mumch. Onto the GAMEPLAY!Modern Sonic plays like he does in the day stages of Unleashed, and for you poor souls who have not played the game, he gotta go fast and he's rolling around at the speed of sound. Classic Sonic is more based on platforming and doesn't have a homing attack or boost, a factor I strongly disliked as  kept trying to use homing when there was none. The controls are responsive, unlike what others say, so don't you worry about that. They never failed on me.Now, what about those red star rings you mentioned before, I can't hear you ask. They're the collectibles of the game. And ones I actually bothered to collect. I'm not a big collecting person, I'm more in games for the story and gameplay. I never try to collect them normally. But 10 per world (counthing the modern and classic variant) was so small to me, and something about the giant pretty red ring made me want to get them. And so I pretty much got them all. Also, Sonic is so strong all he has to do is give Perfect Chaos a headache to beat it. Take THAT, Shadow!			",1,3,0,0,1,0,0

												If you're a Sonic fan you'll love this game. I just got Super Sonic :P Anyhow, I have a mid-grade tower and this game runs perfectly. I see that some people are having issues. So for those saying it won't launch or that it's laggy, try right clicking on Sonic Generations in your steam library> Properties> Local Files> Verify The Integrity of Game Cache... this may fix whatever is wrong. It helped me fix a different game. Also, people using an off-brand controller that's not getting recognized should download x360ce and put that directly in the game folder: SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Sonic Generations  Then launch the controller emulator. After you've configured x360ce once for this game you'll never have to launch it again. I hope this helped. Have fun!			",32,8,0,6,4,0,0

												THE GREATEST SONIC GAME AS OF THIS REVIEWIf you are a longtime fan or a newcomer to Sonic, this game is for you.Half of this game consists of the ""Classic"" gameplay style: 2D side-scroller in the style of the original Sonic the Hedgehog Trilogy for the Sega Genesis. Though the physics have not been translated 1:1, it still is very enjoyable.The other half of this game consists of the ""Modern"" gameplay style, which takes the best mechanics from the gameplay styles of Sonic Colors and the daytime levels from Sonic Unleashed and mashes it together into one of the most exhilarating, blood-pumping, pure-speed experiences Sonic has ever seen.This game's levels consist of seven stage styles from previous Sonic games: Green Hill from Sonic The Hedgehog, Chemical Plant from Sonic 2, Sky Sanctuary from Sonic 3, Speed Highway from Sonic Adventure, City Escape from Sonic Adventure 2, Seaside Hill from Sonic Heroes, Flame Core from Sonic '06, Rooftop Run from Sonic Unleashed, and Planet Wisp from Sonic Colors. Each level has one modern level and one classic level. In my opinion, the modern stages are the best part of the game. While the classic-style stages are very well designed in their own right and are not a problem with the game in any stretch of the imagination, it simply isn't my prefered gameplay style. Modern levels move much faster and Sonic is more versatile with moves such as his homing attack, dash, and quick step.Multiple pathways are riddled throughout modern and classic stages making for excellent replay value. You will not get the fastest time on your first run of any stage which makes for great replay value. This kind of level design is exploration done right in Sonic games. If you've played Sonic Boom on the Wii U, from 2014, you know how exploration in Sonic games can be done completely wrong. Sonic Generations is the definitive Sonic game for both newcomers and veterans to the series. Not only does it have easy to pick up controls and a simple story, it has enough depth to keep people coming back and trying to beat their times on each stage.I haven't even talked about mods yet, so here we go:While I am relatively new to the modding community on Sonic Generations, it is rich and thriving even six years after the game's release. I downloaded the Unleashed Project which ports over the Daytime levels from Sonic Unleashed into the Modern Sonic levels, and I also downloaded the Tropical Resort level mod which ports all five stages of Tropical Resort from Sonic Colors into the Modern Sonic stages. The mods I've used so far have worked near-flawlessly. Some mods may lack polish, but that isn't necessarily a flaw or a bug. The only bugs I've encountered are purely cosmetic and hardly noticeable. That's not to say that all mods are flawless, because there's no way that every mod is in 100% working condition, but the modding community cares very much about quality and the most popular mods should have little-to-no problems. To make things even better, the way you install/use mods is through a program called Sonic GMI, which is an application that manages all of your mods. You can choose specific mods to enable in almost any combination, or you can turn off mods entirely and play the game vanilla-style (without mods). This makes mods much more easily approachable than mods in other games such as Super Smash Bros. for Wii U or Minecraft. In those games, you'd have to go through several complicated processes with lots of room for error that could cause damage to your game (maybe not in the case of Minecraft, but I digress...). The user-friendly Sonic GMI makes mods more approachable and easier to use for people who are very anxious to get into Sonic Generations modding very quickly.			",29,1,0,1,3,0,0

												While some may write this off as just Sonic fan service, it's actually much more than that. Sonic Generations if the perfection of the boost formula seen in Unleashed and Colors while also bringing back Classic 16 bit Sonic (albeit he isn't as fluid as the original). These 2 different forms of Sonic gameplay actually blend really well together and give us the best of Sonic's past. However good gameplay means nothing without level design and thankfully Sonic Generations has some of the best, if not the actual best levels in the entire series. Sure, there was copying and pasting going on here but even with that the levels still feel new and fun to playthrough, with many alternate routes available for replaying levels. That being said the butchering of Wisp Planet from Colors is almost unforgivable. What'd you do to it? Also speaking of copying and pasting; the music is phenominal. These are fantastic remixes of past tracks and the game even allows us to assign whatever music we want to each level. You know what that means? City Escape on every single level obviously.It's easy to see this game was rushed to meet a deadline and while I would have liked more, what we got is still top notch. This is the Sonic game I come back to the most which is saying something since I've been a fan since the Megadrive. Let's hope the upcoming Sonic Forces is even half as good as Generations.

												This game was alright. If you are a fan of sonic/platforming, then I recommend buying as there are some new concepts that I haven't seen before. You also get the oppurtunity ti platform in 2D and 3D which is a nice feature. Saying this, the story fails to explain certain parts, especially the ending leaving many plot holes. Overall, the game was pretty good although I'd definitely buy it on sale if I were you as the game is quite short with no real replay value, unless you want to fully complete the game.

In a Sonic game!- The camera isn't fighting you every step of the wayBad:- Poorly optimized for PC. You will have framerate issues unless you have a beefy PC- Rouge the Temptress mission is bugged and can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to complete- Feels a little short, espeically if you aren't going for all the red rings or trying to complete every missionOverall an excellent title and the best Sonic game to come out in the last several years.

												This is a Sonic game for the fans. It features the old-school 2D platforming that we grew up with and merges it seamlessly with the fast-paced modern levels of recent games. While short, Sonic Generations has a ton of repay value, rankings/leaderboards, collectables, mini-games etc. and with a healthy mod community it's easy and fun to add new levels, change character designs and otherwise play around with custom modifications. This game features 'remixed' versions of games throught the Sonic Franchise's history such as the classic Green Hill Zone, City Escape, and even a Perfect Chaos boss battle. Long time fans of the games will appreciate the throwbacks and humorous charm (which this game has in spades), and the remixed versions of old Sonic soundtracks were a definite treat. I'd buy this game when it's on sale in the sonic bundle for £10-15 - that same bundle includes Sonic and Sega All Star Racing (+transformed), Sonic adventure 1+2 and many more, it's a great buy and arguably one of the best bundles on steam.Pros:+Bright, colourful graphics+Good retro soundtrack+Remixed stages will please long-time fans+Solid 2D/3D platforming+Mod SupportedCons:-A little short-Story is far from gripping-No completely new levels-Super Sonic boss fight not quite as epic as I would have liked-Where is Big the Cat?!Score: 4/5			",214,43,4,31,8,3,13

												To all classic Sonic fans please, you must get this game! In fact it isn't even an option, it's a MUST have game. Everyone else, I will recommend you buy this if you love a classic speedy adventure platform game. You can choose between the original 2D side scrolling gameplay and the evolved 3D version if you prefer. Sonic has been one of the first games I got hooked on, as a remodel of old levels with new features and highly improved animations and 3D visuals, this is an amazing game with humorous and quirky charisma from cute characters and a fast paced adventure starring one of the most famous gaming characters in history!

												This is definitely one of the best Sonic games out there. It's beautiful.It's controls are fluidAnd the story isn't half bad, although very short and simpleIt has a couple funny moments but it's obvious Generations was meant to focus more on gameplay than anythingI found myself replaying each level at least five more times after the inital completion, and the game seems very easy to 100% in achievements, although it will take some time. The biggest chore you'll have is collecting all the red stars, but that's it.I paid $30 for this game, and I think that money was very well spent. I'll be around still playing this game for months probably.  ",105,23,3,21,5,3,5

												I am an avid Sonic fan, and have been since his debut on the Mega Drive (Genesis in America). My absolute favourite title would be Sonic 3 & Knuckles, for tis gameplay and first-time lore and story elements, all without a single word of dialogue.Sonic Generation has come the closest to balancing the old platformer with the new 3D speed driven Sonic. It is an absolute thrill to try and get that little bit faster just by repeatedly playing levels; all of which look and feel gorgeous. Too bad Super Sonic is anti-climactic. I always looked forward to being Super (or Hyper) in S3&K! So yes. Need a good Sonic that jokes on its own werewolf past? Grab your chili dog and get this one.			",28,5,1,9,3,0,1

												Way past cool. If you're not a fan of Sonic, this game probably isn't for you, but if you are, it's a pretty fun game. Great for speedrunning too because this game lets you go FAST!Pros:- Great stages- Great music- Good graphics- Mods- Overall content is less than Sonic Colors, but still has a lot going for it. Mods also give this game a lot of extra content.- PC exclusive graphics options, like 60fpsCons:- Missions are a chore and don't really add to the game- Strange issues with the configuration application on different devices.

Sonic Generations is a bright and uplifting story. It is a tale of hope and redemption, a story of a man who rises above his failures to create something genuinely great. Sonic Generations is not simply a Sonic game. It is not merely a simple 3D platformer. No, Sonic Generations is a game worthy of this generation that will be remembered for generations to come, and then even more generations after.Sonic Generations is a good game.

												So, you love Sonic 3 & Knuckles? You enjoyed the game concept of the Unleashed Day Stages and Colours? You love everything about Sonic the Hedgehog?No? Well you will love this game anyway.Sonic Generations is hands-down the absolute greatest 3D Sonic game EVER. Yep, it beats SA(DX), SA2(BHD), and Sonic Colours! This game might just be even BETTER than Sonic 3 & Knuckles! You can play as the Classic Sonic of the early 90's, or you can play as the Modern Sonic of 2008 and onward. The level design is fantastic, the music is amazing, the graphics are mind-boggling...but you MAY need a good PC to run it well, or just lower the settings. If you want more graphical power, buy a console version if you have a normal PC. I own both the PC version AND the PS3 version, so I have the best of both worlds. But, overall, the PC version wins if you have a great computer. 60FPS and amazing graphics, plus you have UNLIMITED modding power! I have already downloaded about 5-7 different major mods, such as the Unleashed Project, the Adabat Adventure Pack, and Sonic Generations: Episode Metal. Basically, even if you don't like Sonic, buy this game. It completely sums up the beauty of the Blue Blur, and creates an amazing experience. It goes for pretty cheap now, so if you say you can't afford it, then you have no soul.Not to mention you can play pretty much any level from Sonic Unleashed (and every now and then Sonic Colours) in this game, modded in, for FREE. Even the DLC levels! I mean, come on, don't bite the hand that feeds you!			",91,11,4,1,8,0,1

												I absolutely, whole-heartedly reccommend this to any platforming fan, Sonic fan, or ANYONE.  Classic plays and feels almost exactly as it should (spindash is a bit overpowered compared to the older Sonic games), and modern plays like a slightly upgraded Colors. There's tonnes of unlockables and an online time attack mode that should keep the replayability fairly high, and there's all those tasty achievements to get.All in all, his has now become my favourite Sonic game of all time (with Sonic 3 & Knuckles being a VERY close second), all the nostalgia mixed with great core platforming, and an absolutely euphoric soundtrack makes this a must-own.

												Sonic Generations marks the 20th anniversary of the Blue blur, and with celebrations of our beloved gaming icon, a game also joins the club. And what kind of game is it?The game allows you to play with 2 Sonics. One from the good old genesis days and one from the modern Sonic days. Sounds confusing? Well, time travel is always confusing so don't point at me. The two Sonics are on their way to save their friends, speeding through stages of the past and fix the timeline.The gameplay is fun for everyone, either an old skool Sonic fan or a new one, or even someone who has never been part of this franchise. Like playing old platformers with speed added, classic Sonic is your friend! More of a 3d speed section fan, modern Sonic is the guy you want! You'll have to play with both of them to complete the game but don't worry, you'll enjoy it.The music consists mainly of older Sonic themes being remixed. For example, when you go through a stage you will hear two versions, a classic version and a modern version of the original stage theme. And they are absolutely a joy to listen to.Other things also make a return or are brand new. There are mission gates which allows you to go through stages with an other goal than reach the finish, and there's a skill shop in which you can adjust Sonic's gameplay style to your own. Want more speed? Buy the blast off skill. Want more grip? The acceleration skill is something you want.There are only two negative points that I have to mention with this game, which are the length and the story. The length of this game is only 4 hours long, not counting the missions and collecting red rings or achievements, so that's a bit of a let down. The story is pretty akward. There are barely any cutscenes, and making a story including time travel tends to fail easy if done wrong.I would advice this game to any fan, wether old skool, modern lover or not a fan of Sonic overall.

												I had bought this game when it first came out in 2011 for the Xbox 360 and the whole time playing was just such a nostalgia trip. When I got to the first boss, just sitting in the white space zone listening to the music, I instantley told myself that this was the Death Egg Robot from Sonic 2, when I finally got to the cutscene showing it was in fact the Death Egg Robot, nothing but chills in my body. Just thinking back to when I used to play Sonic 2 when I was little and when I finally beat the game, just seeing that boss be back again, with the music remade and everything, I had the biggest chills ever and I will admit that it brought a tear of enjoyment to me knowing that one of the hardest bosses I ever played against as a kid was back. I throughly enjoyed this game, the nostalgia from the levels, enemies, bosses and music remakes. The first 2 bosses, first 2 mini bosses and the first 6 levels were what really hit me with the nostalgia, playing through the levels I grew up on as a kid, fighting the bosses all over again, loved this whole game. Let me also say, the boss battle against Shadow, was amazing, I played the living hell out of Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on the GameCube and getting to play on City Escape and fighting Shadow in a slight change, really made me want to go back and play SA2B again. 3 years later when I have switched over to PC gaming, it was the same enjoyment for me again. I without a doubt, hands down recommend this game. Yes some of the bosses were easier than they were in their past games (Death Egg Robot, Perfect Chaos and Metal Sonic were the easiest for me) but still, basically going back and playing through the levels that were there when playing other Sonic games, was simply amazing for me. This game was very easily one of the best games I have played, there were times it was a little frustrating (only when going for achievements) but other than that, very enjoyable and will very easily go back and play it again in the near future. 11/10 will play againSega, good job on the game!

												Sonic Generations is the 20th anniversary game and features both the 2D and 3D gameplay from past Sonic the Hedgehog games. So, to know if this game is worth to be played, let’s get down the road and review this game.Story:The game starts as Sonic from the past (who is known as Classic Sonic is this game) running at Green Hill Zone when a weird monster-like creature appeared. In the next part, Sonic from the present (who is known as Modern Sonic) gets a surprise birthday party from his friends. But before they could start celebrating, the monsters-thingy appeared out of nowhere and kidnaps Sonic’s friends and Sonic chases the monster to save his friends. Modern Sonic travels throughout different levels that seem to be very familiar to him, and realizes that he had visited the zones before- he traveled back to the past. There, he met someone who look like him, albeit younger. Modern Sonic teams up with his past self, Classic Sonic, to save their friends and restore color to the world.Gameplay:This game has two gameplay style based on your character. Classic Sonic represents the games from the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and features 2D gameplay, while Modern Sonic represents the games from the 3D games such as Sonic Adventures and features its 3D platforming gameplay. You can choose freely who to use when you’re at the hub are of the game or when selecting a level. Act 1 is Classic Sonic while Act 2 is Modern Sonic.Classic Sonic features skills that he used before from classic titles. Classic Sonic uses skills like Spin Dash and Spin Charge to boost his speed and attack enemies. You could also use the down on the analog stick while running to attack enemies. Since he is in a 2D environment, Sonic could only move left and right to proceed throughout the level.Modern Sonic features skills that are used in 3D Sonic the Hedgehog titles such as Sonic Adventures. Modern Sonic can move freely on the field and can Auto Lock-On enemies to use Homing Attack. Modern Sonic can use the X Button to Dash at enemies at full speed and it has a meter that can be replenished using Rings that are scattered throughout the level.The goal of each level is simple: Run through the 3 stages, play the challenges to get the keys to the boss then defeat the boss to unlock the next 3 stages. Challenges offers different goals to complete it such as using a certain power up, defeating a doppelganger, teaming up with another character, and many more.Graphics:The graphics of this game looks great even though it was released back in 2011. The art style is nice, as the stages greatly resembles its appearance from the game where it came from and the characters were created neatly. The water movement from water levels also has its graphics rendered very well. The animation for wind effects, fiery explosion, facial expressions were great and well animated. The aesthetics for the buildings and smoke in Crisis City Zone, the seafloor at the Seaside Hill Zone, the skyscrapers at Speed Highway Zone are very excellent, as if you’re looking at a piece of art.My only problem is the Hub Zone. It was very bland compared to the hub zones in Sonic Adventure. Also, you can only explore the hub in a side scrolling fashion, but not in 3D open world exploration. Although maybe it’s because of the game’s story? Oh.Music:Most Sonic games’ soundtracks were a piece of art and give us thrills and excitement throughout a level. Well, guess what? Those soundtracks are back and some of them are remixed to suit the level. Playable stages had their themes remixed and both 2D and 3D version of each stage has its own remixed theme. For example, the theme for Green Hill Zone Act 1 (Classic Stage) has the music closely resemble the Genesis version while Act 2 (Modern Stage) gives an upbeat music compare to the Act 1 version.Other tracks from other Sonic games such as Open your Heart and Live and Learn can be collected and use that soundtrack to change the stage’s music. Who wouldn’t want to run on Speed Highway with Live and Learn as the background music?Presentation:The game is divided into three segments: Classic or Genesis era, Dreamcast era, and Modern era. They each have 3 stages from the games of their respective era, along with a boss stage and a rival stage. You will see stages such as Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant, City Escape, and so on. These stages are created to mimic their appearances from past Sonic games and has a major overhaul for 2D and 3D gameplay. For example, the Green Hill Zone’s Act stage is based on the stage of the same name from the very first stage of Sonic the Hedgehog game on Genesis. It has its 3 act combined into 1 stage for Sonic Generations in the 2D segment and created an entirely new version of the stage for the 3D gameplay of Modern Sonic.The game also features extra stages were you can do challenges like gathering certain amount of rings or catching certain number of Chaos. It’s a great and fun alternative when you wanted to replay a stage but with more challenge. Finishing them gives you unlockables such as artwork, concept art, and music from other Sonic titles.Characters from the Sonic franchise appears and although not playable, they served as Sonic’s friend/rival on different extra stages. Characters like Knuckles and Tails help Sonic in some stage like destroying an obstacle. They also appear as rivals, like Knuckles having a race against Sonic.Despite that, the extra stages were kind of repetitive due to the challenges mostly racing, collecting certain number of rings or reach the goal before time runs out.Overall:After suffering from broken games these past few years (*cough* Sonic 06 *cough*) Sega managed to create a great game that gives both nostalgic and new feel to gamers. Not only that they presented and combined some amazing stages, but they also managed to recreate it without losing its touch. The stages are still awesome like their past counterpart. The story feels a little weak compare to the story of Sonic Adventure and Sonic Colors, but still is great since it was simple, unlike the Sonic 06 complicated story. The game was great and I recommend this game to you all gamers out there.			",5,7,0,2,3,0,0

												The best game of all time. I am a huge Sonic fan, but this is a really good game even if you aren't a sonic fan. Buy it now! The only thing I have to complain about is that it's pretty short, but you have some side missions as well to go through as well.Multiplayer would also be nice. You can compare times, but that's about it. It would be nice to have like a race or to play it through with co-op. One play as Sonic and the other one plays as Tails, kinda like Sonic 4 ep 2. That would be awesome.Keep in mind that if you have too many friends, you can't access the multiplayer part. It's a bug in the game that probably never will be fixed. For this, I've changed the rating of it from a 9 to a 8.This game gets an 8/10.			",772,146,31,93,83,11,95

												Absolutely awesome!This game is handsdown one of the best Sonic games in the franchise. It's fast paced, runs at 60 FPS (PC MASTER RACE), and has lots of levls from past Sonic games renewed and remastered.The game is pretty much the 20th Anniversary of Sonic and the story makes you go back in time and play old SOnic levels such as Green Hill, Cuty Escape, Planet Wisp, etc. You play as both Classic and Modern Sonic. Classic Sonic is mainly the platforming part of the game where as modern Sonic is more of GOTTA GO SPEED THROUGH THE ENTIRE LEVEL AND GET DEM WORLD RECORDS YO. They're both fun to play as and they both have their own seperate levels.The best part about this game, especially the PC version, is it's 60 FPS and THE MODS! The mods are the main reason why I have more playtime in this game then I should. The mods by the community are amazing. Different characters, levels, remakes, you name it. The mods will keep you hooked on to the game for hours.Flaws:-Short game (sadly)-♥♥♥♥♥♥ final boss-SOMEWHAT poor optimizaation-No MultiplayerOther than that this game is amazing!9/10			",153,11,6,6,3,2,0

												I loved this game, seriosuly I don't know why I took so long to play it. The controls were responsive, I did have some frame rate issues for a few seconds maybe 1-3. But they went away after leaving the area, the game is visually amazing. I had so much fun bouncing from classic and modern and it was seriously an awesome experience! Definitely recommend this game, playing old stages and new stages was amazing to see! The Soundtrack is also pretty good!			",173,20,3,9,14,0,14

												Now, let me just say that this is my opinion. Do respect this, and everything will be fine. :DFirst, I like to say that this is my faforite Sonic game since i got it on a birthday.It really shows why Sonic is important in the game world.This is a fast platfroming game, and I really LOVE it.I was a fan of Sonic since I firstly played Sonic Heroes on my Gamecube, and I still don't regret it.This game needs more attention and populairity. It's worth it. Really.If you fully clearedd the game, it doesn't have to end for the game by itself.Since Dario FF discovered the fact that the game can be modded, I was really blown away.So do play it, hopes for more amazing Sonic games in the future, and have fun with modding if you do know how it's done. :DI honestly recommend this to all people. It's a must have!			",32,1,2,1,1,0,3

												Absolutely awesome!This game is handsdown one of the best Sonic games in the franchise. It's fast paced, runs at 60 FPS (PC MASTER RACE), and has lots of levls from past Sonic games renewed and remastered.The game is pretty much the 20th Anniversary of Sonic and the story makes you go back in time and play old SOnic levels such as Green Hill, Cuty Escape, Planet Wisp, etc. You play as both Classic and Modern Sonic. Classic Sonic is mainly the platforming part of the game where as modern Sonic is more of GOTTA GO SPEED THROUGH THE ENTIRE LEVEL AND GET DEM WORLD RECORDS YO. They're both fun to play as and they both have their own seperate levels.The best part about this game, especially the PC version, is it's 60 FPS and THE MODS! The mods are the main reason why I have more playtime in this game then I should. The mods by the community are amazing. Different characters, levels, remakes, you name it. The mods will keep you hooked on to the game for hours.Flaws:-Short game (sadly)-♥♥♥♥♥♥ final boss-SOMEWHAT poor optimizaation-No MultiplayerOther than that this game is amazing!9/10			",153,11,6,6,3,2,0

												Sonic Generations is the 20th anniversary game and features both the 2D and 3D gameplay from past Sonic the Hedgehog games. So, to know if this game is worth to be played, let’s get down the road and review this game.Story:The game starts as Sonic from the past (who is known as Classic Sonic is this game) running at Green Hill Zone when a weird monster-like creature appeared. In the next part, Sonic from the present (who is known as Modern Sonic) gets a surprise birthday party from his friends. But before they could start celebrating, the monsters-thingy appeared out of nowhere and kidnaps Sonic’s friends and Sonic chases the monster to save his friends. Modern Sonic travels throughout different levels that seem to be very familiar to him, and realizes that he had visited the zones before- he traveled back to the past. There, he met someone who look like him, albeit younger. Modern Sonic teams up with his past self, Classic Sonic, to save their friends and restore color to the world.Gameplay:This game has two gameplay style based on your character. Classic Sonic represents the games from the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and features 2D gameplay, while Modern Sonic represents the games from the 3D games such as Sonic Adventures and features its 3D platforming gameplay. You can choose freely who to use when you’re at the hub are of the game or when selecting a level. Act 1 is Classic Sonic while Act 2 is Modern Sonic.Classic Sonic features skills that he used before from classic titles. Classic Sonic uses skills like Spin Dash and Spin Charge to boost his speed and attack enemies. You could also use the down on the analog stick while running to attack enemies. Since he is in a 2D environment, Sonic could only move left and right to proceed throughout the level.Modern Sonic features skills that are used in 3D Sonic the Hedgehog titles such as Sonic Adventures. Modern Sonic can move freely on the field and can Auto Lock-On enemies to use Homing Attack. Modern Sonic can use the X Button to Dash at enemies at full speed and it has a meter that can be replenished using Rings that are scattered throughout the level.The goal of each level is simple: Run through the 3 stages, play the challenges to get the keys to the boss then defeat the boss to unlock the next 3 stages. Challenges offers different goals to complete it such as using a certain power up, defeating a doppelganger, teaming up with another character, and many more.Graphics:The graphics of this game looks great even though it was released back in 2011. The art style is nice, as the stages greatly resembles its appearance from the game where it came from and the characters were created neatly. The water movement from water levels also has its graphics rendered very well. The animation for wind effects, fiery explosion, facial expressions were great and well animated. The aesthetics for the buildings and smoke in Crisis City Zone, the seafloor at the Seaside Hill Zone, the skyscrapers at Speed Highway Zone are very excellent, as if you’re looking at a piece of art.My only problem is the Hub Zone. It was very bland compared to the hub zones in Sonic Adventure. Also, you can only explore the hub in a side scrolling fashion, but not in 3D open world exploration. Although maybe it’s because of the game’s story? Oh.Music:Most Sonic games’ soundtracks were a piece of art and give us thrills and excitement throughout a level. Well, guess what? Those soundtracks are back and some of them are remixed to suit the level. Playable stages had their themes remixed and both 2D and 3D version of each stage has its own remixed theme. For example, the theme for Green Hill Zone Act 1 (Classic Stage) has the music closely resemble the Genesis version while Act 2 (Modern Stage) gives an upbeat music compare to the Act 1 version.Other tracks from other Sonic games such as Open your Heart and Live and Learn can be collected and use that soundtrack to change the stage’s music. Who wouldn’t want to run on Speed Highway with Live and Learn as the background music?Presentation:The game is divided into three segments: Classic or Genesis era, Dreamcast era, and Modern era. They each have 3 stages from the games of their respective era, along with a boss stage and a rival stage. You will see stages such as Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant, City Escape, and so on. These stages are created to mimic their appearances from past Sonic games and has a major overhaul for 2D and 3D gameplay. For example, the Green Hill Zone’s Act stage is based on the stage of the same name from the very first stage of Sonic the Hedgehog game on Genesis. It has its 3 act combined into 1 stage for Sonic Generations in the 2D segment and created an entirely new version of the stage for the 3D gameplay of Modern Sonic.The game also features extra stages were you can do challenges like gathering certain amount of rings or catching certain number of Chaos. It’s a great and fun alternative when you wanted to replay a stage but with more challenge. Finishing them gives you unlockables such as artwork, concept art, and music from other Sonic titles.Characters from the Sonic franchise appears and although not playable, they served as Sonic’s friend/rival on different extra stages. Characters like Knuckles and Tails help Sonic in some stage like destroying an obstacle. They also appear as rivals, like Knuckles having a race against Sonic.Despite that, the extra stages were kind of repetitive due to the challenges mostly racing, collecting certain number of rings or reach the goal before time runs out.Overall:After suffering from broken games these past few years (*cough* Sonic 06 *cough*) Sega managed to create a great game that gives both nostalgic and new feel to gamers. Not only that they presented and combined some amazing stages, but they also managed to recreate it without losing its touch. The stages are still awesome like their past counterpart. The story feels a little weak compare to the story of Sonic Adventure and Sonic Colors, but still is great since it was simple, unlike the Sonic 06 complicated story. The game was great and I recommend this game to you all gamers out there.			",5,7,0,2,3,0,0

												Sonic Generations has to be one of the best sonic games released in the last while, it brings in challeneges for a similarity to the Sonic Adventure games, it has 2D stages that go 2.5D for the Classic Sonic stages which are Act 1 of every level. then there's 2D, 2.5D and 3D for the New Sonic Act 2 Stages. it mixes in some great moments from previous games along with new idea's for a long time sonic fan this game has a lot of replay value to it. I would recommend getting Sonic Generations it is actually a really decent sonic game compared to the more recent titles that have been released			",190,12,21,17,5,0,20

												Sonic Generations is an amazing game! I've beaten it multiple times on Xbox 360 and the PC version is just as amazing with MODS and the Casino Night DLC, it was just on sale before I wrote this review but it is still worth the $30 price tag. If you ever see it on sale though and you have the money, you should go ahead and buy it!One problem with this version is that it does crash sometimes but that's probaby just my PC.

												The Sonic games have had a spotty record after the transition to 3D.I'm happy to say this is one of the good ones. Half the game is modeled after classic 2D Sonic games and the other half plays like Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors. The level design is pretty great, and seeing major, historical stages through the Sonic timeline reimagined in this game is pretty amazing. The mod scene also really makes this game, with a bunch of community level-sets (including a complete remastering/adaptation of the Sonic Unleashed stages into this game) over on ModDB, even a few years after release this is probably my favorite Sonic game. And no, I don't feel like a 12 year old saying that.			",172,16,4,22,5,1,7

												I am a man in his 30s and I'm reviewing a Sonic game: Yes my existence is an embarrassing insult. That said someone my age is at the perfect point in their life where Sonic is prime nostalgia bait so indulge me. I admit I missed the ""dark days"" having not touched any of the games since Sonic 3 so my nostalgia may be very limited in its scope.Sonic Generations appears to be a Greatest hits compilation, taking the best bits from a number of prior Sonic games (at least from what I've seen on Youtube) and meshing them together with the most famous levels. I knew Chemical Plant and Green Hill Zone and they seemed to evoke the joys of the older games, and from what I saw of it City Escape looks like the footage of whatever game that was from, so I guess this is a nice and faithful remake. If anything it seems to be Sonic with all the fat stripped off giving a leaner and meaner game than some of the recently badly received titles.With each level there are two variations of how they play out, first a classic 2d sonic map with the old move set from Sonic 2 which is then followed by a modern Sonic map which feels more akin to a racing game in places. Regardless of which is played things usually pan out quite well with a good bead running through both setting the pace and mood for the game.Speaking of pace, Sonic Generations belts along at the rapid pace you would expect of the blue hedgehog. With the speed, momentum and physics system meshing with some very well planned levels the game's camera work and level design mesh to make a very satisfying experience. Sonic games have a somewhat unique design to levels, encouraging you to go higher in a mostly sprawling variety of paths rewarding the use of momentum by giving greater goodies, more interesting challenges and a brisker pace to clear the stage as opposed to the more mundane and slower lower paths. While this may sound like it would encourage exploration, the design is mainly egging the player to utilise the speed they build up. Missed the ledge with a jump? Screw it, make the best of what you have as you GOTTA GO FAST! I normally love exploring everything, but here doing so would break the endorphin rush of belting along. There are some slower sections where you do have to be mindful of enemies, but they rarely cause issues.So this game is all round lovely? Well, no. The above applies to the majority of the game, especially the first half. Maps like Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant and City Escape are blooming fantastic, but later levels like Wisp Zone and Catastrophe City have some quirks to them with badly placed enemies plonked right in the way of speed zones where predicting their presence is a dice roll, also I found the momentum to throw Sonic off platforms at times where it did not make sense causing a lot of instant death pitfalls to occur. Annoyingly enough these moments tend to be in the modern Sonic levels giving more credence to the nostalgic older style being superior and left me not wanting to do the modern versions of the later levels, act 3 being more bad then good culminating in a confusing boss fight before leading to the final boss in the game being a pain in the rear end.Despite it's ropey later levels this is as highly rated a Sonic game can be post 1995. I did try a few of the other newer games while typing this up and they were quite depressing. There is more dreck then quality in this franchise, Sonic being some high profile rock star of the early 90s but aging badly due to what appears to be mismanagement and a strange self indulgence in his obsession with being cool. Like these aging rock stars there are brief moments where they may actually be able to pull it off and gets the old gang back together, though this is usually followed up with a relapse and an age of embarrassment. This is the greatest hits tour after the rehab. If you have ANY nostalgia for this series give Generations a shot, but after that is done it may be wise to stop and never come back.

												As a HUGE Sonic nerd myself, I have to say, this is one of the best Sonic games yet! The graphics and gameplay are really smooth, and Sonic is actually pretty fast in this game, unlike in some others... (cough) Sonic Lost World (cough)There are some pretty awesome scenes throughout out the games, too, like escaping from the Mega Chopper. This game is just amazingly detailed and really has a vibe that not many other Sonic games have brought before. I definitely recommend this game to someone who's new to the Sonic franchise.P.S, Time Eater's hard ;~;			",29,2,0,2,2,0,0

												It's Sonic's 20th Anniversery, and SEGA decides to bundle one of every level, handpicked by us, to be in this new 20th Anniversery title. later during late 2010 / early 2011, the young, blue hedgehog that we all know and love, Classic & Modern Sonic the Hedgehog, was said tbe playable in the game to assist each other to fight the ""mysterious"" ""new"" threat. After release in November, the fans went CRAZY for Generations, the game broght back so many memorial moments in the Sonic universe, from the classic Green Hill, to the ""City-Boarding"" of City Escape. The people loved this game, not just because it's a 20th Anniversery title, as a reminder why we play Sonic the Hedgehog, a reminder of all the fun times we had with him. The music is memorable and great, the levels, handpicked by us, are fun and great to play in, and the story? Oh, who cares about the stroy! The story's bland as heck! Along with the community creating mods to give us a new experience, this game deserves all the praise it gets! High-Quality, High-Defenition Grapchics to boot, this game's awesome!I give it a 9.99/10			",18,4,2,1,2,1,0

												The best 3D Sanic game in years.Gorgeous visuals and pretty good controls make a fantastic Sonic game. There's not a MASSIVE amount of content in terms of levels - 9 Stages with 2 acts each (Modern Sonic and Classic Sonic) - but each one is meticulously crafted and bursting with detail and life.Classic Sonic's controls aren't 1:1 with his megadrive counterparts but they serve well enough. Nothing like Sonic 4. Modern Sonic controls really well and feels super-responsive.The whole game doesn't take itself too seriously and is totally worth a play if you enjoy Sonic games.

												Sonic Generations is a hidden ""gem"" among the other pretty terrible Sonic games out there. After beating the game I found it to be fun, but lackluster, nothing that stood out as a reason to recommend it; however, once I figured out that there was a huge modding community out there for the game my outlook on the game changed and I felt I had to mention it, if only briefly.Team Sonic has been doing some bad and some good in their games. The epitome of this mindset has to be Sonic Unleashed - there's a really cool part of the game where you go flying around through well designed levels at breakneck speeds collecting coints and almost getting dizzy from the camera movement while you race against time to reach the finish line. Those levels were amazing and fun. Then there were the ""God of War""-esque levels coupled on there as well, which were slow, boring, and, sadly, mandatory. I bought that game on PS3 and hated it - not so much because the Were-Sonic sections were terrible (which they were) but because of the lost potential the game had. Well, Sonic Generations takes it in the right direction, utilizing those same awesome level types where you fly around at lightspeed but instead of a Were-Sonic you are granted an Oldschool-Sonic for Type B levels. This would be fine if that Sonic didn't handle like a 12-Ton dump truck. The physics seemed to work fine but the stopping and starting of the character were just awful, and I found myself using my trademark ""spin"" while accidentally moving so I'd be going at about 2 miles/hour while the time keeps ticking away and I keep getting more aggravated. Those levels weren't nearly as much fun as the other levels, and normally I wouldn't recommend half a game, but Sonic Generations on PC is unique in that the modding community allows you to turn the game into what you want to play. Want more of the good levels? Download the Sonic Generations Unleashed Project. Want to change the physics up to more of a ""classic"" Sonic feel? Go ahead, there's a mod for that too. The ability to swap in and out parts of the game that you don't like or want to experience more of really turns Sonic Generations into a hidden gem that can provide hours of fun for any level of Sonic fan.Pros:Mods (see above)Full Controller SupportGreat Level Design (for the most part - Modern Sonic levels shine)Good MusicCons:Handling/Controls (especially Classic Sonic)Fixed Camera (makes some platforming awkward)Unnecessary RPG-esque Upgrade System Leaderboards are a fun idea, but it's rampant with cheaters - first hundred or so entries on all boards are 0 second runsAs I said, I wouldn't recommend the game without the modding community backing me up. That said, even if you're only going to play vanilla, the game isn't terrible, and the Modern Sonic sections shine and show the level design genius Team Sonic has. With mods Sonic Generations squaks by with a B+			",711,211,14,90,55,8,86

												One of the best Sonic games ever made and tons of nostalgia bombs. Great mix of past stages and ridiculously awesome remixes! (Give Modern City Escape a listen and prepare to get a happiness overload) A worthy 20th Anniversary game and a great game in itself.			",78,7,3,14,5,0,3

												This is a bloody good game! Sonic The Hedgehog at it's finest in this amazing blend of old and new. This is what modern Sonic The Hedgehog is supposed to be, Sonic Generations does everything it has set out to do beautifully and more than makes up for the disappointment that Sonic The Hedgehog (2006) turned out to be. In this mixture of old and new, Sonic Generations brings back an iconic level from each of the most popular Sonic The Hedgehog titles (such as Green Hill, Chemical Plant, City Escape etc.) with an act for both the retro Sonic 2D scroller style that we all grew up with and the more modern 3D Sonic Adventure style, both of which have their own unique features making them similar and familiar, but different enough to keep them interesting and fresh. The game also includes a museum of sorts and a nifty skills/perks feature for both the old and new Sonic. Plenty of mini-games, unlockables, achievements and side-stages that accompany the main game structure bring lots of replay value to the Sonic Generations too, there is quite a lot to do.With that being said, the only real problem with this game is that the story feels very short, it definitely could have benefited from some additional stages, but that doesn't make this any less of a great title. Sonic Generations is the modern version of Sonic The Hedgehog that we've been waiting for, this is what we wanted and SEGA delivered. If they remade all of the retro Sonic The Hedgehog games in the style of the Act 1 Sonic Generations levels, it would be perfect.  This is a must have for Sonic The Hedgehog fans, and even one to grab if you're new to the franchise, this game brings the best features from all the eras of sonic games together to make one fantastic game. Couldn't reccomend this more!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're a fan of Sonic Colors, and/or a fan of Sonic Unleashed's daytime stages, then I suggest you pick this game up. This game offers a set of nine individual levels from three eras of the Sonic franchise, ranging from the Sega Genesis to Nintendo Wii.The gameplay is a combination of Sonic Colors and Sonic The Hedgehog (Genesis Titles). Throughout Classic Sonic's stages, you'll be doing a lot of platforming in a 2D realm, whereas Modern Sonic you'll be doing a lot of boosting. The game offers two acts with every level- one for each Sonic.The graphics are simply superb. Playing this on the consoles doesn't do it justice. The console version runs at 30 FPS where the PC port runs at 60 FPS. The attention to detail in the levels are stunning as well. Green Hill Zone looks fantastic, and City Escape is absolutely beautiful. You can really see where San Francisco was the inspiration for that level. However, before purchasing this title, do realize that this game can get be very heavy on your PC at times. While I never experienced problems, my friends reported having some slowdown during some areas such as Chemical Plant and Planet Whisp. Also, it's recommended that you use an Xbox 360 and/or PC controller for this game. The game is worth the price, and it's a must have for any Sonic The Hedgehog fan. I suggest giving it a purchase and playing it now! If you're not sure, how about you click that ""Download Demo"" button up there at the top and give it a try. I gurantee you that it'll change your mind. ;)			",130,29,3,8,10,1,6

												I don’t consider myself a Sonic fan and I really don’t have any nostalgia for the series as a whole.  Most of my good memories come from Sonic and Knuckles, so it has been a long time since I played a Sonic game for any real length of time.   I discovered a nostalgia and love for Sonic through this game that I didn’t know existed. Its gameplay is simple but effective and its graphics and art charming.  No matter your level of respect or disdain for that little blue rodent this is a game worth exploring.The story starts off as Sonic celebrates his twentieth birthday, with a monster known as the Time Eater crashing the party and dispersing Sonic's friends to various stages in history. Sonic is knocked out after futily taking on the monster. He wakes up in the White Space dimension and encounters Tails, as well as his plumper, black-pupiled younger self. The two Sonics have to free their friends in two different versions of levels that have emerged over the years, and eventually defeat the monster summoned by Dr. Eggman. Modern Sonic utilises the game mechanics used in 3D games like Heroes and Colours. His homing attack allows him to lock-on to an enemy when he jumps at them and can boost through levels for additional speed. Classic Sonic handles the traditional side-scrolling levels, sporting the ability to spin-dash. Levels run at a slower pace as they require some more caution, and he also can’t auto aim at enemies or jump as far.Generations is something of a healthy montage of what comprised the first twenty years of Sonic games. The nine stages are all throwbacks from three console eras. Three zones from the heights of the ‘Classic Era’ have been lovingly reimagined, including the signature Green Hill. The ‘Dreamcast Era’ touches up Adventure’s Speed Highway and City Escape plus Sunside Beach from the later Heroes. The ‘Modern Era’ even revitalises Crisis City from the disastrous 2006 reboot, as well as Rooftop Run and Planet Wisp from Unleashed and Colours. Boss fights are dispersed between each era, but can only be unlocked upon completion of three side missions. These are usually comprised of another objective within a level, such as a ghost race or collecting items. Some are fun and others are less so, but aren’t a necessity to reach the end. Similarly to secret special stages in the originals, hidden stars encourage exploration of the multiple paths in each level. There are also the Red Rings hidden in the main stages to encourage players to explore every nook and cranny as both Sonics to find them. Ample rewards await players who take up all of these challenges in the form of new powers, which can be added to either Sonic's play mechanics to make old stages new again. These powers are hardly throwaway, but they're also hand-picked from Sonic's rich game history. Prepare to relive the fun of using the special elemental shields from Sonic 3, give Classic Sonic the Homing Attack, give Modern Sonic unlimited boost meter in exchange for one-hit death (one of my favorites), allow either Sonic to stop on a dime, or even endow the time-slowing skill from Secret Rings. There are dozens of these, and they're great for playing around in stages, exploration, or for finding the best combination for the fastest times.Bottom line: If you are or have ever been a fan of Sonic the Hedgehog during the series' two-decade history, then this is your game. Sega made this for us. If you've been away from Sonic for a while or have been wondering what he's all about, then this is actually a great game to start with, as it features the two best-playing versions of Sonic in the series, along with his greatest stages, all in one place. Play it however you can, even if you rent it, but whatever you do, don't call it ""short"" or ""over quickly."" There's enough game here to last potentially ages.

												This game is awesome!!! Speedrunning through the stages as Modern Sonic was so much fun. The plot was just amazing where Modern Sonic meets Classic Sonic and so both of them go through various stages and bosses. But the best part is that you can play tons of mods in this game. You can download the mods from the internet and you will need to download SonicGMI which enables you to load the mods so that you can actually play them in Sonic Generations. I would recommend this game to everyone, especially to huge Sonic fans as this game is one of the best Sonic Games out there!!!			",13,2,2,0,0,1,0

It took me playing a sonic game to find out that i'm terrible at playing sonic and that i'm honestly not a fan of it.  I'm positive others could have a lot more fun with this but it's too fast for me and I'm too slow for it.			",92,16,0,5,3,0,6

												This is practically a sonic game that allows you to relive some of the best moments of the sonic franchise.The game is split into two different game styles: old school and new school.Old school is where you play as classic sonic and remember the good old days of a simple(...ish) 2D platformer with the occassional jumping and dashing into robots, and going up against the evil nefarious Dr. Robotn--ahem, Eggman.And new school is practically taking the mechanics of current gen Sonic and playing through a 3D environment, using your boost, rails and homing attacks to get past the zones.Maybe I'm a little too old school, but I much prefer the classic Sonic if anything. It feels well paced.But in any case, this game made me appreciate Sonic all over again, and wished that it didn't end so soon.For a price tag of $30, I feel that's a little overpricey for a game that basically lets you play areas that you've visited before, and would like it more if this game either had more levels or had a price cut for it. But when it's on sale, this game really is a must to buy.			",111,19,4,20,3,1,4

Intro: DREAM SONIC GAME.well, close to it lol.The Sonic series has had a lot of ups and downs. 06's buggy mess, the storybook series, the Werehog stages, Sonic 4's broken physics. It really hasn't been that great for the blue blur, but Generations has truly restored the famous hedgehog to his former glory. Colors was pretty decent (Worth playing on Dolphin if you haven't) but this game is so much better.Gameplay: There's a great blend of sidescrolling and full 3d platforming. The stages are very well designed and its just what you'd want out of a modern Sonic game. Like the old classic games, there are so many alternate routes and paths. While Unleashed day stages were enjoyable, they were quite linear. That's completely gone and improved so much. This FINALLY feels like a modern take on the classic Sonic series and really what else should an anniversary remake be? The speed here is fast like Unleashed and the platforming isn't blocky like it was in Colours. There's a great blend of everything. No forced gimmicks, with the exception of optional side missions and those are actually quite fun as well. Speaking of which, this game has a nice amount of content for a Sonic game. Apart from the mentioned side missions (and there's a ton), there's a bunch of unlockables such as powerups you can equip for playing levels and music tracks.Music: Speaking of music, this game sounds wonderful. It includes a bunch of remixes of tracks in the series as well as complete remakes of them with the original artists returning! On top of that, you can use the unlocked music to change what plays in each level. Such a simple, but great feature.Visuals: Since we're talking about art, the visuals in this game are fantastic. The textures might not be the highest and a tad more anti-aliasing in the options wouldn't hurt, but I'm just nitpicking. This game looks absolutely gorgeous and I think they absolutely nailed the artstyle for a modern Sonic game.Story: The story.. umm. yeah, the story isn't good. Its just there. Don't expect a good story in this one. Considering this is an anniversary title, I don't think it even matters. The game is fun enough that I can look past this without considering it a flaw.PC Version: As for the PC side of things? This game is one of Sega's better ports and I'm glad to see them improving on that aspect. It runs quite well and I had no issues with it. Works flawlessly with the few gamepads I've used and performs without problem. Even when I had a weak PC, I could stay at 60 FPS pretty easily. Also has some leaderboards.And of course there's mods. From your typical character swaps to music changes to new levels and even full blown expansions. The most popular one is the Unleashed project. It ports all of the day stages from Sonic Unleashed into this game. Tons of fun to play through and you don't have to suffer through those tedious werehog levels :)Conclusion: Overall this game is definitely a top favorite for the series and I'm a rather big Sonic fan. In fact, finding out the modern Sonic games were on PC now was a huge motivation to even get a proper gaming PC. This was my first game on Steam! and it still holds up 5 years later.I really loved playing through Sonic Generations and can't recommend it enough. Its not something that'll get you hundreds of hours unless you're a completionist, speedrunner, or enjoy playing or even creating mods, but there's still plenty of content and replay-ability regardless. I really think its the best Sonic game out there! Give it a go.Buy it.			",131,23,9,11,7,2,11

												Sonic Generations is the game that Sonic fans have wanted for years. SEGA's Sonic team has struggled to make Sonic work in the 3D space. But Generations handles it very well. Having both classic and modern Sonic help to facilitate two very different forms of gameplay. Classic Sonic's levels have a greater emphasis on platforming in 2-d esque stages. Modern Sonic has the bigger 3-D levels. A lot of these levels have sections that are on rails but these help lend a sense of speed. Modern Sonic also has some of his more recent tricks like his homing attack. This contrast between the two gives the game variety. As you complete levels you progress through a simple but entertaining story. Like Mario; Sonic stories generally never get too deep or overly complex. The game avoids many of the errors Sonic games have had in the past; like shoehorning in new characters. In my time with the game I haven't met any new characters. Old familiar faces like Tails, Knuckles and Amy are present. Visually the game looks very nice indeed which is further helped by a mostly consistent framerate. I did have a few drops here and there however. Having played Lost World I felt the level design was fantastic and the parkour system was an interesting new mechanic. If they could find a way to take the foundation of Lost World and marry that with the speed found in Generations I think it would make for quite a Sonic game. If you are a Sonic fan and have not played this game. This is definitely one you want to check out.			",85,9,0,9,7,0,16

												Nice game, it has the 2D classic gameplay and the modern 3D stages and brings some iconic stages redesigned, which is very cool.The fun of the game lies on the 3D stages, I didn't like the 2D classic gameplay here, but I think it is worth to have if you played the first ones of each era.

												Probably the best modern sonic game, the level designs are great, soundtrack is great and you can go incredibly fast, decent replay value with missables and challenge levels as well, there's allot of nostalgia for sonic fans here.If you want to get the full sonic experience however, it is highly recommended that you play the Sonic Unleashed Project mod after beating Generations, it replaces all the levels of generations with remastered levels of the Sonic Unleashed day levels, which where all excellent levels, now with higher framerates, better graphics and 100% less wherehogs ",556,75,15,50,19,2,43

												Very good Sonic game where you play classic stages of the saga with 3D beautiful graphics. I love the amount of replayability it offers and the possibility to change the music that plays in the stages.  I loved the main campaign but didn't enjoy very much the challenge doors though. However loved both classic and modern stages, the epic bosses and the rivals like Shadow or metal Sonic. The modern Sonic gameplay though is very similar to daylight stages in Sonic Unleashed so you'll run at very high speed but sometimes platforming isn't very accurate. Great game nevertheless, the best Sonic game I've played since Sonic Adventure DX in 2003			",52,2,4,0,1,0,0

												If you love some classic Sonic gameplay, this title offers it up with at least half of the gameplay.  The controls are tight and almost exact in terms of response compared to classic Sonic games.  Each level is split into a ""classic"" and ""modern"" Sonic style, although the modern style still often uses side-scrolling as a regular mechanic.  Lots of classic levels re-done in new and interesting ways.  Quite a treat and a welcome departure from previous Sonic games.The best part?  Skipping the freaking cutscenes.Anyway, its a time killer that's definitely worth it if its on sale and you enjoy some classic side-scrolling Sonic action.Pretty much the first solidly good Sonic game since Sonic Adventure.

												I'm an old Sonic fan, I admit. My father bought me a Sega with Sonic 2, I played it every weekend when I was allowed. Rented Sonic 3 and all, but stopped there, upgrading to the nintendo 64.But it's alright, I heard those games I missed were terrible anyways.In all seriousness, Sonic should appeal to me, and it does. If you are a person who liked the gameplay of Sonic games. It makes smart decisions, because it relies often on classic tropes. Modern Sonic is very fun too, arguably more than classic Sonic.The only flaw is that sometimes modern sonic gets 2d segments, modern sonic can dash in midair, classic sonic cannot, sometimes this is confusing.Overall great game, good controls, it feels great.If you wanna go fast, get it.

												This game is living proof that SEGA is serious about getting the Sonic franchise back on track. After a few piles of♥♥♥♥♥♥they decided to label games (most notabley Sonic the Hedgehog for the Xbox 360) the franchise looked like it was on its last legs. But out of nowhere games like this came out and honestly it blows my mind how much a company does care about the quality of their products, particularly their flagship franchise (unlike Activision and COD). The music is really good, the controls (playing with a gamepad) are pretty solid, the story didn't make me want to kill myself (again I'm looking at you Sonic the Hedgehog for the Xbox 360), and for the most part the game runs flawless.I have encountered a memory leak issue which I easily fixed by launching the game directly from the steamapps folder, and also a noticable fps drop on certain parts of Chemical Plant but in all honesty those things are so small and forgivable because of how good this game is.SEGA, please keep up the quality. I don't care if the game has to be delayed a couple more years because of it, I am willing to wait if the end product is anywhere near as good as this.			",109,10,3,11,7,2,11

												When I was little I had a Genesis and only a handful of games for it. Of the games I had were Sonics 2, 3, and & Knuckles. I played them all so much. When I grew up and moved out, I bought a Genesis from a games emporium just so I could play those Sonics on my TV once more. Later I played Sonic Adventure at the nagging of my friends and quite enjoyed it, too.It is a constant shame that there have been such flops since the good old days of Sonic as to ruin the name of the franchise. But then theres this game. This game is competant and neat. It evokes the feeling of the old Sonics and it doesn't screw around. I feel like I'm 5 again.I reccomend playing it even if you've never been a fan or never played a Sonic game.			",434,121,4,56,50,5,43

												It's a good and fun game. If you're into Sonic, definitely worth checking out.Modern Sonic plays like normal Sonic from the Unleashed game, which focuses on high speed platforming.Classic Sonic plays like the old sega genesis Sonic, which focuses on more slow platform gameplay while still retaining some of his characteristic speed, though the physics aren't 100% recreated, it's still fun to play as the cute little blue hedgehog of the old days.After you beat the main storyline there's a ton of post game content and challenges to complete, so there's much to keep you entertained after your done with the main content.Even after that, you can check out community mods which are full of other fan created content.

												Up front I will say that I have never been a fan of Sonic. I never disliked the games, but none of them ever grabbed me. I recently tried to play Sonic Adventure 2, and while the Sonic/Shadow stages were reasonably okay (but not fantastic), the other types of stages were boring, tedious, and annoying. Not to mention the laughable plot or horrendous voice acting and volume mixing issues that game has. Far from ""best game ever"" as many Sonic fans would try to make you believe. After having played through the entirety of Sonic Generations, I will say that hands down THIS is the best Sonic game. Taking levels from all of Sonic's history and offering two seperate versions of the levels (classic mode, which plays like the genesis games, and modern mode which plays like the daytime stages of Sonic Unleashed or Sonic Colors), as well as providing many challenges for each of the levels. The gameplay for both modern and classic modes feel great, and aside from a few very minor issues, this is an incredibly enjoyable game, if a little bit easy to get S rank on the times. Definitely would recommend, but perhaps not at full price. The game took me about 8-9 hours to complete including all challenges, so it's not incredibly long. If you don't do all the challenges and only do the ones that are required, you could probably blaze through the game in half the time it took me.			",692,144,6,71,54,4,61

												If you have been growing tiresome of the continuous flops that Sonic Team has been shooting out over the past decade, Sonic Generations will serve as a blunt reminder that the Blue-Blur still has some life left in him. Sonic Generations is a monumental tribute to fans; boasting large and beautiful recreations of iconic stages from past games. (FYI, said games are Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic & Knuckles, Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Heroes, Sonic 2006, Sonic Unleashed, and Sonic Colors). The nostalgia will be strong with this one; but make no mistake, the actual game here is genuinely good. You alternate between both modern and classic versions of Sonic throughout the course of the game; each level featuring both a classic and modern section.  Classic Sonic plays as you might expect.  Entirely 2-D platforming and the lack of a boost successfully replicate the formula that made classic Sonic the Hedgehog installments so great.Modern Sonic plunges you into EXTREMELY fast-paced mayhem that made it's debut in the form of daytime stages in Sonic: Unleashed.  Quick reaction time is needed to take full advantage of numerous shortcuts that riddle the maps. Also, the mod community has actually managed to find ways of adding new content to Sonic Generations on PC. As a matter of fact, there is a mod out now that allows you to play nearly all of the levels from Sonic Unleashed, despite the fact that it is a console exclusive. Overall, I recommend this game with complete confidence that most will enjoy it.  If you have been discouraged at all by recent attempts to reignite the gaming icon that is Sonic, you NEED to restore your faith right now by playing this game.  In all honesty, the story IS slapped on and completely laughable, but it's refined gameplay and undoubtedly nostalgic nature makes Sonic Generations a crowning achievement for Sonic Team.

												This is th worst sonic game to have every existed (the original being a close second) Why would a sonic game focus on speed when you can adventure RPG style. This game has rid of everything that made sonic 06 one of the best sonic games (if not the best sonic game) on the market. The only enjoyable part of this game was when you had to dig for coins with the red dude who has unnessessary spiked gloves. This was a very fun part of the game due to the slow gameplay. I believe all the other stages where to fast for young people's eyes and combined with the bright colours in some levels, could leave them blind. I also believe this game have parts (such as the evil truck of evilness or the Giant gold fish) Which may give people heart attacks because of how these sequenses normally involve chases which could give you a adrenaline overdose. I give this game a 3 out of 2 because of how awsome that red dude was at digging			",156,34,5,34,35,2,15

												El bonito recuerdo de escenacios clasicos y el poder disfrutar de la extrema velocidad del erizo 'moderno' hacen este Sonic en un buen juego para poder disfrutar como conmemoracion a sus anteriores juegos. Si bien su historia peca de simpleza, la jugabilidad es muy divertida.A esto fuera de Steam les recomiendo el mod del proyecto ""Sonic Unleashed Porting Pc"" que trae todos los escenarios de la version de PS3/XBOX360 de manera increible y totalmente intacta. Realmente Sonic Generation es un juego que sumado a sus ventajas, merece la pena tenerlo en la biblioteca.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where do I start? I own both PC and console versions, which says a lot.This game is AMAZING, and in my opinion it's right beside Sonic 3 & Knuckles and Sonic Unleashed.  It have memorable levels from past Sonic games, as well as music. Classic Sonic feels a little bit off if you expect Genesis-physics, but Modern Sonic is spot on and it's just a blast running through a level!There's not a lot of levels, but the ones that are there are very detailed colorful and you can replay them over and over. The modding community is pretty big too, which adds a nice replayability.All in all Sonic fans, as well non Sonic fans will at least get some fun out of it.			",93,5,1,8,3,0,3

												Very good Sonic game where you play as modern Sonic and the classic Sonic of the megadrive era.You play across already classic levels of the franchise with updated graphics and gameplay.While playing modern Sonic you can boost through the levels at great speed. And as classic Sonic you can spin dash, and the entire levels are in 2.5D.To me, Sonic Generations is the best 3D Sonic game since Sonic Adventure DX. It's very colorful, includes different levels one another, and the gameplay is just very good as both Sonics.The game is very well optimised.I would rate this game an 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic Generations is the best way to acknowledge good Sonic games that doesn't involve playing the older good Sonic games. The PC version of Sonic Generations is a very solid port, with high framerate support, modding support and decent fast visuals. However, running mods such as the Unleashed Project require a decent modern CPU due to the relatively poor CPU porting. This also means that people with slower or less powerful processors may have some problems running busier levels, due to the games poor handling of multiple CPU threads. I did not encounter any framerate problems, but there is always going to be users who do encounter these issues, and my warning is simply ensure that you have a decent CPU. The gameplay itself blends the best of older Sonic, with modern stages built around the best ideas of Unleashed and Colours.I've only played it with a controller, so I can't judge the PC controls. I can point out that there is sometimes some delay between the pressing of the button, and Sonic actually doing it sometimes. Besides these occasional problems, the game controls very solidly and I have no actual complaints involving the controls beside this small problem. Sonic also has some problems with precise movements in some levels due to speed and sometimes eratic camera movements. The game also sadly lacks in the number of main courses, which is a shame because everything that they've put in, both modern and classic are brilliant. Game length is instead lengthened by short challenges that are required for progression, or unlock bonus tracks on the soundtrack for use in the game levels. Sadly, these challenges aren't really that interesting to play compared to the actual main games levels, and even with this, the game comes out on the short side.Visuals and port wise, graphical options are limited, but with mod support and game support for high resolution textures and shadows, the port works well most of the time. For the speed that Sonic moves at, the visuals are acceptable (and improvable with mods), and run at 60 FPS, something not available on the console versions.Sound-wise, the game for the most part shines. It features many tracks from older Sonic games, most of them are remixed and sound really good. Voice acting is a bit strange, minor characters such as those from Sonic Heroes, or ones like Shadow sound really stupid, but the main characters are voiced fine enough I suppose, although Eggman/Robotnik is the only one who I think sounds close enough to what I asscoiate the character with (that's what happens when you change voice actors when I'm not paying attention). There are some issues with audio sychronisation that I've encountered and have been unable to ever replicate, such as out of sync audio or no sound in the cutscenes at all, then again, the only thing you miss in this case is cheesy writing. No gameplay affecting issues though in terms of sound. The soundtrack, although consisting mostly of remixes, is still a great soundtrack, probably being one of my favourites for the series.Overall, its a good Sonic game in an age of disappointing Sonic games, probably my favourite in the series. It ends up being a bit too short, which is sad because awful Sonic games like Sonic 06 are many times longer than this for the average player, even with all the bloating from the little side missions. Despite that, I'd say it is worth getting, unless you really hate Sonic. This game does almost everything right, fast colourful visuals, a story that doesn't get in the way of the game and a good varied soundtrack.And then there's mods, which help almost every game they exist for.

												Sonic Generations is a great game although 30 Bucks may be pushing it (get it on sale) Needless to Say there is still alot of fun to be had, I really enjoyed racing through remakes of my Favourite stages (though I wish there was a little more) and even after beating the four to six hour Storyline (during which you also get to face other hedgehogs) you can dive into doing Side missions which are pretty good (stay away from vector). This game even has a modding community, a pretty awesome one at that so if you like getting laughs at modding your game sonic will not disappoint (I dont know if I spelled it Right). The Downsides are that completing the storyline in one sitting can get pretty repetitive and voice actors have changed (takes a bit out of my childhood) But other than that the game is still really good so yeah, Sonic Generations is good, Just not 30 Dollars good. 8/10 (on sale)			",169,20,2,13,5,0,5

												Sonic 2 was the first game that belonged to me, getting it along with my sega genesis for my birthday somewhere around the years of 92-93. from that peak it has been absolutely tragic how far Sonic has fallen, and everyone has their experiences with how horrible it has been to see the blue blur be reduced to a running joke.If i'm to keep this review short then all i have to say is that Sonic Generations made me feel like a kid again. The opening stage captured the familiarity of long past memories with the joy of uncovering something new. It's not a perfect game to be sure, i had my fair share of frustrations but i think this is a true return to form. If you're an old school sonic fan you'll love it, if you're new to the series; count yourself lucky that you haven't experienced the heartbreak us older guys have and enjoy.i ahve no shame admitting this is a fair representation of me while playing the opening level:https://giphy.com/gifs/wViS9n0RqN2 ",56,4,3,11,5,0,23

My favourite thing in this game is the feel of speed while boosting with modern Sonic.Not only that, but it features lots of nostalgic material, including original and remixed soundtracks, and reworked zones from previous Sonic games.

Stages are all well thought out and will leave you dying to replay them for better times, and the remixed music is pure ear candy. Plenty of extra missions (that are actually enjoyable!) add to the length of the game, and boss battles are genius. Also NOSTALGIA OVERLOAD.			",1746,732,84,245,219,21,320

												Sonic Generations marks a pretty serious turning point that the Sonic franchise has been building up to for almost three years: a good Sonic game. It's missing a little bit of the white-knuckle excitement I got from Sonic Unleashed, and could've really benefited from DLC expansion content, but this is the first Sonic game in a very long time that I feel comfortable recommending to others. I've produced a video review, if you're interested.

												Sonic Generations is a celebration of Sonic 20th year of video gaming history, this title has no big complex plot just a normal Sonic game this time around, unlike Sonic's 15th celebration with broken game play and awful story, this game is good and I can say they did one hell of a good job with this one. The story, I can't say that it will be the most understandable but at least it's simple and only has one story this time unlike 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog. The Music:When it's good damn it's good; only a few tracks are off in this title, notably Sonic 2's chemical plant act2 and Sonic Adventures City Escape act2.Sonic Generations is a buggy mess of a game, but at least it can be fun, even if there are a lot of flaws that I think could have been worked out with a little more testing and feedback from longterm fans of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.I could only think they Sonic Rushed it out the doors of there offices before even testing it for last minute bug fixes, the 3d engine camera is very broken and can even be broken from normal game play, this seems to be the case for all version of the game so if you think it’s just the PC version.PC port specific errors:Online mode crashes:Even with a normal everyday Internet connection, this makes very little sense, the only thing it should be doing it downloading the scores and uploading the fastest time you have set in online time attack. If your Internet is slow even by a little bit or even if it is fast, it crashes and have you to restart the game to try again and hope to Jesus the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ will not crash again.Game Controller Support is broken:If you have a xbox360 controller it works fine, if you don’t well you will have to download and install a modded pad input emulator to get the damn thing to work.No window mode:This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move that game programmers have made before, nothing to bad but if you wanted to do this well damn.Video config glitch:If you update your video card drivers and you then you try and play the game, it will give you an error and say for you to run the config, then after doing so nothing changes, it will keep giving you an error until you go into the game folder and delete a config file before you can play the game again.

												Ok then I mind as well give my intake on this game. And I have to say I freaking love Sonic Generations. I have been a long time sonic fan since the very first game and comic and even tv series. So I know what to expect out of the companies who make Sonic who and what he is in the gaming world today. Yes there has been so not so good games out there but not all were bad. At times with this game as I play I wonder to myself: as fans do we even deserese such a good game for ♥♥♥♥♥ing so much...either way I have to say I love how good the game looks, how it sounds and plays and the detail to little to no plot as always. (yes I just said that lol) But all jokes aside to those who PC game, if your still a true fn to the series, please give this game a shot. In fact give Sonic a shot again. Cause the blue blur is not dead yet folks. Least not in this Sonic fan's eye. Now with this review I am just going to say it loud and proud: It's juice and jam time! :D			",175,56,3,41,16,1,12

												Sonic Generations is an amazing game, it gives you the experience of levels both old and new, and it has an amazing mod community. With all the side missions, it goes for hours of gameplay. You can choose to enjoy the scenery and go slowly, or zip through the level, or as most would say: ""GOTTA GO FAST"". You have the choice between Classic Sonic, or Modern Sonic, Classic Sonic making the levels 2D, and as you can probably guess, like the classic games (STH1,STH2,SCD), and Modern Sonic making it a mixture of 2D and a fresh, open 3D style. Ok, not so open in some levels, but still truly amazing. I would reccomend this game to anyone.			",70,5,2,3,4,0,2

												Absolutely. Buy this.The classic Sonic mechanics aren't perfect but still very much enjoyable. The elemental shields return, which is always nice even though it's not mandatory to win.The modern Sonic is where this game really shines : this game understands how a 3D Sonic should be played and offers the ultimate experience.The PC version offers a 60 FPS experience which will make the levels even more enjoyable, and with the mods available plus the one coming later, you would miss a lot of fun with the Blue Blur if you didn't buy this.If I had one tiny problem with this game it would be the last bossfight which is absolutely terrible & annoying. But you can still beat the boss once you get used to the awkward controls of this last battle. Plus, one bad bossfight versus tons of fun levels & other bossfights ? This game is an absolute winner.			",258,21,3,33,9,0,13

												Very enjoyable from start to finish; I remembered all of the stages and I'm really interested in getting the handheld version as well, due to my love for the handheld levels too. As much as I like Modern and Classic Sonic controls, I feel most at home back in Sonic Adventure 2. With my 80 some lives. XDAnyway, there are a few problems such as level glitches and even the rampant left sidestep glitch (I refuse to use XBox stuff) so it's not exactly the best, but it's all there and I'll still play it, after I find a patch for that dreaded drawback. Get it for consoles for better controlling.Ultimately, 7/10. I had fun despite getting game overs (I shouldn't have died as many times as I did. I REALLY despise that sidestep nuisance. Classic Sonic was easiest and most fun to play.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best Sonic game in the last decade, and even though nostalgia helps make this a great play for gaming veterans, it's still a great platformer by its own right. Excellent music with remixes of many of your favorite Sonic level themes, and tweaked level designs that seems to have been tuned to solve some of the frustrating ""didn't see that coming"" problems that so often plague Sonic games.Some may say that it suffers from a shortage of content and excessive padding (12 stages with 2 levels each, and mandatory ""challenges"" to reach the boss levels), but it seemed just right to me, for a game of its nature and for the price I paid.Gets a point shaved off because of the terrible final boss battle.

												This is probably my favorite Sonic game of the last 15 years. It's not something I plan to go back to and doesn't get visited near annually like 3&Knuckles, but I still enjoyed it a lot. It improved on the few things I liked about Unleashed and Colors and the added PC benefits of a rock solid framerate and higher resolution makes it more of a spectacle to play. I don't have the metrics or straight comparisons to validate this, but Generations felt a bit slower to me compared to Unleashed in the 3D sections. Either that or the zones were designed with Sonic's movement in mind more. While Unleashed felt like a game that rewards rote memorization and simply has too much ""speed"" for the sake of speed, Generations felt like a game that rewarded good reaction time and doesn't punish as harshly. It seems like windows for finding the alternate paths, ducking the obstacle, etc, are more lax. This sounds like the game was simplified a bit, and that's maybe true; however it just felt more balanced, and more fun to fail and more rewarding to succeed (and more likely without commiting the map to memory.) 2D gameplay is great. And while I feel it is also slowed down a bit, it manages to hold my interest compared to other platformers which haven't. Wisp powers change things up without being too abundant.The story and dialogue and everything outside of gameplay is garbage. Or, extremely silly and simple. Which I suppose is a direction I don't mind compared to melodrama or whatever you want to call what was vomited out of the mid-2000s games. If you've played Colors it's mostly more of the same here.The various challenges are hit or miss. Many require playing the game in an extremely unituitive manner with questionable gameplay, Espio challenges are especially bad. However, the time-trial esqe challenges were extremely fun to undertake. The act 2 Planet Wisp challenge offered a great deal of enjoyable frustration as it required me to really learn the stage in order to succeed.Basically, I feel Generations is a platformer worth playing, even if it still has the stink of modern-day Sonic on and in it. Hearing both original and remixed tracks of various sonic themes is quite the trip down memory lane, even if the songs get a little less familiar once you get past the Genesis era games.

												This is SEGA's love letter to fans that were waiting for the time when Sonic The Hedgehog returned to his roots and had a great sense of speed, Sonic Generations is probably the best 3D Sonic game to be released since Sonic Adventure 2. In this wonderful game you play as both Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic, racing through stages from the blue hedgehog's past thanks to time travel, yeah the plot isn't really that great or isn't suspensful in anyway possible it's just an excuse to have 2 Sonic's on screen and give SEGA, the chance to revisted old worlds such as Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant including some of the modern stages that have been completely remade, some for the better i'm looking at you Crisis City.There is a lot of music in the game and it's fantastic the stage music is great both different for Modern and Classic Sonic, they also included various theme songs from different games and give you the choice to choose which song you want playing on a stage, once you've unlocked the tracks via getting red rings which I highly recommend you collect there is a lot of extra unlockables, though it's a shame you can't play as other characters but that can be done with mods on the PC version this game has a very active modding community so it's worth purchasing on PC and if your a really big fan of Sonic the Hedgehog, if you are then you'll get a kick out of this!.

												To be quite honest, this is the best Sonic game I've played in a very long time. While it isn't too great on its story aspects, it delivers amazingly on what Sonic fans care the most about - Gameplay. The Classic Sonic gameplay found in the game appeals to even those who weren't very fond of the classic games, since it's easier to get the gist of and is required for less than half of the game. Modern Sonic's gameplay in this game is basically what it was in Unleashed, except with 90% of the issues fixed. And, with no night time stages to hold you back, the only disappointing thing about Modern Sonic is the lack of levels, since you only get nine levels with four boss fights, and some(lame) modified layouts of those levels. This is where the modding community comes in, though. Thanks to modding, this game's faults can all be fixed with additional content, and even content from the previous games. As someone who enjoys Sonic, you really would owe it to yourself to buy this game, especially during a sale.			",162,6,1,11,4,2,3

Story Well,there barely is any and what's left of it can be ignored but if you play a Sonic Game for the story then I have some bad news for you.Basically,Sonic friends are kidnapped and you have to free them by beating the level.You will go back to levels and settings of previous Sonic games like GreenHill Zone (Sonic the Hedgehog; what a surprise), Rooftop Run (Sonic Unleashed), or Speed Highway (Sonic Adventure). Dr.Eggman is obviously also involved in the story.GameplayThe game is devided into two part: The Modern Sonic Gameplay and the Classic Sonic Gameplay.The levels with Modern Sonic are 3D and 2D similar to Sonic Unleashed or Sonic Colors and also play similar to these games. Classic Sonics levels on the other hand are all in 2.5D and are much more similar to the classic Sonic games (Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2 and 3&K) and not like Sonic 4.After you have beaten Act 1 & 2 of an era (each era consists or 3 Zones, there are 3 eras) you have to beat three challenge levels. There are alot of challenge levels to choose from and they are mostly rather easy so that shouldn't be a problem. Beating challenge levels can also unlock news skills that you can then use in Act 1 & 2 and you also unlock music from older Sonic games that you can then listen to or select as the music to play in a level.Then there also are the Rival Battles and the Boss Battles, there is one Rival and one Boss Battle in each era and each of the are similar how you originally fought the boss but they are different enough to feel completely new.There are also 5 Red Rings to collect (only in Act 1 & 2) that also unlock new music and skills. SoundtrackThe Soundtrack is as good as always and since this is an anniversary game it consists of a lot of (great) remixes.And like I already said, you can unlock new,old music that can be used in levels and challenges.Summarized, the soundtrack is great.PC PortThe PC port is functional. It does everything it has to. I haven't had that much problems with it. Sad thing is that the Online Mode doesn't really work in the PC Version and you can't play Sonic the Hedgehog 1 like you could on consoles (but we can buy the pre-order DLC, which they can't :P )Also,each time you change your PC set-up (like for example the monitor) you have to go the the files,delete all .cfg files, then re-start the Conig Tool and then you can play the game.This is rather annoying but when you don't change your set-up this shouldn't affect you.The game only shows you the Xbox 360 controller icons but you can change the key-bindings so that shouldn't be a big problem, controller is still recommented.So yes, I recommend this game but not for 30€Also,this game has some great mods which you can have fun with like for example play the Act 1 level of Sonic Unleashed or change the character model to Shadow.I made a list for that here:

												Sonic and pals are throwing a super cool nostalgia party, and you're invited! How fun! Chilli dogs, drinks, and music galore! Everything starts out just dandy as our favorite hedgehog reflects on his past triumphs in the good old days. You can't help but gush over how much fun is in the air. You were there! You remember how great things were back in the day! As Sonic goes on, you note several inconsistencies in his retellings of what went on in the 2000s. He's a little buzzed. You were there, and you know those things didn't happen as cool as he's making it seem but he tells it so well that you can't help but be entertained! Eventually you notice our hero's speech get slurrier and harder to understand by the time he's talking about the latter half of the decade, and then all hell breaks loose. Sonic's become heavily inebriated and is thrashing about violently, screaming ""SPIKE! ROCKEEEET!"" at the top of his lungs.You're trying your best to placate him, but he won't let up, and his friends are about as helpless as you are at stopping him. Sonic suddenly stops what he's doing and takes a seat, beckoning you all towards him. He begins to talk about the time he and his past self faced off against Dr. Robotnik and HIS past self while they were piloting some weird time monster. Chills run down your spine as he describes horrors of which you'd never wish upon even the most obnoxious of talking animals. After an eerie silence sets in, Sonic erupts from his seat in a drunken stupor and defecates on the floor. He turns to look at you with his tearful, bloodshot eyes and yells ""they said my future was gonna be great!"" before jumping out of the window and sprinting off into the wilderness, shrieking. After witnessing this horror, you can't help but to mutter to yourself that he wasn't always like this, and that one day, one day he'll be having great adventures once again just like the good old days. Like the good old days...In the meantime hey this game is wonderful fun until you get to the Colors stages and final boss which are total crap 8/10 would spindash again make sure you get the good mods for it too			",262,18,3,16,4,0,17

												The best Sonic game since Sonic Colours. Brings a healthy mixture of old school Sonic gameplay ala Sonic The Hedgehog 1 - 3/CD and most of the mechanics brought in from Sonic Colours to create one of the best Sonic experiences ever! While the story is, kinda flat, note that the story itself isn't the main draw of the game, but rather the nostalgia it brings about if you played any Sonic game from Sonic TH1 all the way thru the Adventure serie to the Sonic Unleashed/Colours serie, if you've never played a Sonic game before, there's no better place to start :3.

												It doesn't take a hater to realize that the past couple of years have been pretty bad to Sonic. Sonic The Headgehog 2006 was the zenith of these terrible games. And I mean terrible. Like, really bad.Sonic Generations however is the complete opposite of those games. It feels like the 'Orcarina of Time' for Sega. The controls are tight, and combines the best of both the old school 2D Sonic games with the Next Gen 3D Sonic games. Theres a wonderful little story that ties it up, and the best part for many will be the fact that Sonic's friends take a backseat completely and only serve as a motivation for Sonic to run at the speed of sound.I do not like Platformers. So take what I say with a grain of salt, but I really enjoyed Sonic Generations, mainly because of all the wonderful BGMs (City Escape and Rooftop Run). Sonic Generations hosts a collection of the best momments in the Sonic franchise sprinkled with alittle bit of Next Gen quality with old school care. No matter if your a fan, a hater, or someone who could careless about Sonic, you'll find enjoyment in this game.GOTTA RUN FAST!			",258,26,2,46,38,2,29

												Like Skyrim with fast11/10 would fast againRight now to the real review:Sonic Generations came out back in 2011, so I am a little late to the party. But I might as well convince you to buy the game anyway.Sonic Genrations takes Sonic and Co. on an adventure through Sonic's past. Classic stages such as Sonic 1's Green Hill Zone and Sonic Adventure 2's City Escape re-imagined for both modern Sonic, and classic Sonic. Modern Soinc plays the same as he does in the Unleashed Daytime Stages, and in Sonic Colours, sans wisps. (There is actually a mod called the Unleashed Project that brings stages from Unleashed onto PC). Classic Sonic plays like he does in Sonic 2, 3, and Sonic & Knuckles.Both Sonics control very well. Controls can be a little sensitive at times but it's not a major problem.The story is good, not great. But Sonic isnt as story-centrc as other games, so it's no big deal. A monster called the Time eater rips apart space and tme and Sonic saves the day with his past self.The game has a surprisingly large modding community. There's  stage mods (The Unleashed Project, the STH2006 Project), and mods to replace sonic with Metal Sonic, Shadow, Silver, Blaze.... The list goes on and on.There however a few problems I've had with the game, mainly being fps drops down as far as 10-15 at some times, however that may just be my hardware. (Intel HD 4000)Overall I highly recommend this game to new and old Sonic fans alike. A blast of nostalgia for old fans and a Greatest Hits/Quickstart for new fans.Sonic Generations gets a solid 8/10			",162,5,10,12,11,2,10

												This is a fun game as it is, but a little on the short side. Unless, of course, you download some mods. I would buy this game even if mods were not an option. However, the fact that they are makes this a must have game for anyone into platformers, or just want a good laugh.			",32,6,0,3,1,0,5

Sonic Unleashed (2008), and Sonic Colors (2010).

												Sonic Generations is a platform game in which players control Sonic the Hedgehog in two forms: Classic and Modern, in which their main objective is to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds, free their friends and uncover the mystery behind the Time Eater, a mysterious entity who creates time holes. The game features levels derived from 20 years of Sonic history, spreading across three eras, each having three stages and two bosses from previous games: the Classic Era, which features stages from the franchise's early years on Sega Genesis, the Dreamcast Era, focusing on stages from games released during the Sega Dreamcast years and the early years of the franchise's move to non-Sega systems, and the Modern Era, with stages from titles released on high-definition systems, which are played as either Classic Sonic or Modern Sonic.[8] Classic Sonic's levels are strictly two dimensional side scrolling stages, using classic moves like the Spin Attack and Spin Dash, while Modern Sonic's levels follow the 2D/3D style gameplay of Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors, featuring techniques such as boosting and homing attacks.] As well as classic power-ups such as Invincibility and Speed Shoes, certain levels have unique power-ups, such as skateboards in City Escape and Wisp powers in Planet Wisp.Classic and Modern Sonic begin the game with six lives, which are lost when they suffer any type of damage with no rings in their possession, or fall into a pit or drown. More lives can be earned by getting 100 rings or finding a monitor (item box) that gives them an extra life. If the player runs out of lives, the ""Game Over"" screen will appear, in which the player can continue by selecting ""Yes""Each zone consists of a main act for each Sonic, the first act is for Classic Sonic and the second act is for Modern Sonic, as well as 10 challenges such as beating an opponent to the goal or finishing a stage with limited rings. A Skill Shop allows players to use points earned from high scores to unlock upgrades such as abilities, shields, and even the original Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis game (Xbox 360 and PS3 only). Completing challenges, as well as finding Red Star Rings hidden in each of the main Acts, unlocks additional skills, as well as bonus concept artwork and music. The music can then be played in any stage, challenge, or boss fight. There are also online leaderboards for two modes: Ranking Attack, which challenges players to obtain the best time and score on each level, and 30 Second Trial, which challenges players to see how far they can get through a level in 30 seconds.The 3DS version follows similar gameplay to the Sonic Rush series for Modern Sonic, and features a different set of levels to the console and PC versions, some of which directly recreate the layouts of classic Mega Drive levels. As opposed to the Skill Shop in the console version, abilities are unlocked as the game progresses, with Classic Sonic learning a Homing Attack and Modern Sonic learning a stomp. Exclusive to the 3DS version are Special Stages, similar to those of Sonic Heroes, in which players must collect spheres in order to gain boost to chase after a Chaos Emerald. The game features 100 mission stages that are unlocked either by progressing through the game, meeting other players on StreetPass, or spending Play Coins, as well as both wireless and online multiplayer modes, in which two players can race against each otherThe game begins with Sonic holding a birthday celebration with his friends, before a mysterious entity known as the Time Eater arrives and uses ""time holes"" to scatter everyone across different points in history. After being knocked out by the Time Eater, Sonic finds himself in White Space. After Sonic rescues his best friend Tails, they discover versions of themselves from the past, referred to as ""Classic Sonic"" and ""Classic Tails"", who are depicted with the appearance and proportions used in concept art from the Sega Genesis era of Sonic games. As the two Tails determine that Time Eater's actions are damaging time and space itself, both Classic and ""Modern"" Sonic race through their history, restoring time to normal and rescuing their friends. Throughout the course of the game, Classic and ""Modern"" Sonic encounter Dr. Eggman and his classic self, referred to as ""Classic Eggman"" (Robotnik), and collect the 7 Chaos Emeralds.When the worlds are restored and the Chaos Emeralds are collected, the Sonics discover that the mastermind behind the now perfected Time Eater are Eggman and Robotnik. ""Modern"" Eggman reveals his plot to complete the Time Eater Robot by joining forces with his past self, Dr. Robotnik (Classic Eggman), and harnessing the Time Eater's power. Therefore, Eggman will erase his past defeats from history Although the Time Eater manages to overpower the 2 Sonics, the support of their friends and the power of the Chaos Emeralds allow them to transform into their Super forms and confront Robotnik and Eggman. The Sonics eventually destroy the Time Eater, restoring time to its proper state. The heroes return to the present and continue celebrating Sonic's birthday. After the party, Classic Sonic and Classic Tails travel back to their own time as everyone says their farewells. After the credits, Robotnik and Eggman are trapped in white space			",99,5,2,0,3,0,1

La gran pega es que esta versón de PC es un desastre, no detecta las tarjetas gráficas nvidia y hay que hacer malabares para que funcione, además la configuración de opciones va en un launcher externo que apesta y NO FUNCIONA.

												The ideal Sonic experience for everyone, enhanced by PC capabilities! Combining the 2D platforming gameplay of the classic Sonic games and the high octane 3D & 2D platformer-racing gameplay of Sonic Unleashed and Colours into one package as Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic respectively, there's gameplay content to appeal to every Sonic fan here... all with the addition of a modding community that continues to keep the game alive where SEGA chose not to.Want to play the entirety of the Daytime stages from Sonic Unleashed? How about playing as a slower-paced and more platforming capable Modern Sonic under the guise of a 2006 style Sonic? Or playing as Classic Sonic in Modern Sonic's stages, or vice versa? What about a Silver mod with a flying air boost, or a Blaze mod with more aerial based physics? And what would you to say to the few yet wonderful custom levels that show the capabilities of level creating?There's so much content to mix-and-match and keep going back to in whatever manner you want, and that's the true strength of Sonic on PC.(old recommendation trashed; replacing with this newer review)			",199,91,4,24,9,2,10

												Sonic Generations is a blast from the past that I'd recommend any Sonic fan to play. With the game starting at the zone that started it all, Green Hill Zone, and going all the way to Planet Wisp, Sonic Generations was a serious nostalgic trip that any classic sonic fan or modern fan would have a good time playing. The game also sports a pretty awesome soundtrack! Classic Sonic's varation of the stages have a 90's/Genesis feel added to the songs and Modern Sonic's varation resembles the music style of how Sonic's music sounds today! When it comes down to rating the game I'd give it a 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a pretty good sonic game. Coming from the old genesis days, they did a great job at recreating the feel of the old levels and some great new ones complete upgraded with mind blowing speeds and beautiful graphics.  The only issues I have with this game is that some of the boss and challenge fights you go through are a little confusing and it takes some time to figure out what you need to do.  The hold up is figuring some of these challenges out.; and thats not in a good puzzle / solid boss fight sort of way, you will literally run laps around a course chasing someone and thinking ""WTF am i supposed to do to end this? ""  My other beef is that the game is too easy. There is really no accountability for lives lost and its pretty much a breeze through,  minus the aforementioned challenges. and boss fights that are not clear on objectives.Overall though, very fluid, very colorful and very enjyable ~ reccomended for all sonic fans and for the keeeids.  7.5 /10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everything good about Sonic games in general, in a single game. Not at all gimmicky, so, relax. The modern Sonic stages are very much like Sonic Unleashed's day stages, while the classic Sonic stages are like stages in an older Sonic game. Just make sure your computer is good enough for the game, and have the graphics settings set accordingly, afterall, if the game doesn't perform well, that kinda kills the fun of a game where you go fast.

												As a huge fan of the series I can say that this is the best modern sonic game.If you like platformers - it's must have.If you're not convinced about the series, it's the first game you should try.+Two great gameplay styles (classic and modern).+Dynamic arcade gameplay.+Sense of speed.+Good idea for a story.+Very good replayability of the levels, many different ways to pass the stages, many additional missions, lots of secrets and unlockables, beating the time record of the stages to get higher ranks and compete in leaderboards.+Epic boss battles.+Great soundtrack.+Nostalgia-filled levels.+Very good graphics, plus PC version is way nicer and smoother than console versions.+Great community-based mod support, lots of mods to download.+AFAIK - very good use of stereoscopic 3D, also on PC.+Unlockable Super Sonic for both regular classic and modern levels after beating the story.-Minuses not noticed at all excepting very, very, occassional camera bugs at the start of the stage (restarting the level helps immediately; i noticed that after a long playtime after beating the story).-Final boss battle could be done better, but overall it's not that bad.

												Very excellent game here. I enjoy playing this, and I just love seeing stages like Seaside Hill and City Escape remade. It makes sense why Sonic's 20th anniversary was a huge success, unlike his 15th. Despite the fact that no new music is introduced, having our favorite stages with their remix makes up for it. This is why Sonic won't die, despite the fact that Sonic's franchise are notorious for having really bad games. Most say Sonic was ruined when it became a 3D game, but the dreamcast games proved that wrong, and then we have a game like this, released only 5 years ago. This is a Sonic game that will forever be remembered for how amaizng it is, unlike *cough* Sonic 06.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Sonic games are bad! They are buggy, the camera can't keep up, and the control is awful!"" It's time to forget all that.Sonic Generations features some of the tightest controls I've seen in a Sonic game, a vivid reimaging of Sonic levels from the past, and an excellent soundtrack. Both 2D and 3D sonic are fun to play as, and each level has a remix based on which character you play. That being said, there are some occasions where the camera does bug out. However, this only happens on rare instances. Furthermore, I have not run into any other bugs I can remember during the 5 hours it took to finish the story.Besides the main story, there are many challenges to keep you busy. In conclusion, this is the Sonic game you were waiting for.			",243,32,5,13,6,2,26

												This is one of my most favorite games! I play it every chance I get! The reason I love it so much is because...it's SONIC! Runnin'  fast, jumping on enemies, defeating the bosses, etc! This game is the WHOLE PACKAGE!!! I recommend this, because it is a very unique game. It crosses over with both the modern version and classic version of the game, which makes it less boring. At times it's hard, but most of the time it's super easy. I'm kind of an amateur gamer, and playing this game makes me look like I'm a complete pro!So if you're just starting out with Steam, looking to buy your first family-friendly game,  this one is right for you. Trust me, paying 30 bucks for this is completely worth it.			",20,6,1,1,1,0,1

On the console versions, this game runs at 30fps, on the PC version its locked at a amazing 60fps, wich looks amazing. I hardly get any lag spikes at all. Apart from that there identical, so why is the PC version 100% better? Because of its amazing modding cummunity, you can play as different charecters thanks to the cummunity! Different levels made by random peole, some based on real levels some entirely made up. This has got to be the best ive ever seen sonics fanbase, apart from that the fanbase has gone to the deepest lava pool in hell.Heres a website wiht a few mods: http://www.moddb.com/games/sonic-generations/modsThere, now buy this game, or download the demo, i dont really care wich you do.

This game is a must for any Sonic fan, I have only played a little a the moment but I am very please with what I see.

La música es sublime, conservando las composiciones clásicas pero versionadas magistralmente. La gran pega es que esta versón de PC es un desastre, no detecta las tarjetas gráficas nvidia y hay que hacer malabares para que funcione, además la configuración de opciones va en un launcher externo que apesta y NO FUNCIONA. El juego en sí es grandioso, pero no cometas el error de pagar por la versión de PC, cómpartelo para consola, membrillo.			",253,81,6,28,15,4,34

												This is a ridiculously good Sonic game.  After playing all of these recent Sonic games that kinda suck, I didn't really think there could be another good Sonic game.  I'm really glad this game proved me wrong, because this is Sonic at his best.  You play through the game as “classic” Sonic and “new” Sonic.  There are many different stages that are all based on classic sonic levels.  The look and music will make you super nostalgic if you played Sonic on the Genesis back in the day.  When you are classic Sonic, you go through the level just like in the original game as a 2D side scroller.  The graphics are great, and the gameplay in these sections is pure classic Sonic.  When you are new Sonic, you play through the game in a racing style.  It almost reminds me of Sonic R on the Sega Saturn but a million times better, because Sonic R SUCKED.  Anyway, these sections are just as fun.  You get to run through the level as quickly as possible and you lock onto enemies more like the new sonic games.  These different game modes go together better then you'd expect it is super fun.The game is pretty short, especially if you don't care about getting a high score.  There are challenges after you have beaten the classic and new Sonic levels, and most of these are fun.   A couple are pretty tedious, but luckily most of these are optional.  There are some pretty fun boss fights in the game too, but don't expect anything too challenging.  The game is very easy to complete, but you can always go back to the levels and try and beat your score which is where the developers obviously hoped you'd spend a lot of time.  If you are the kind of person that likes getting high scores and short times, then you will be obsessed with trying to beat your old scores.The bad part about this game is the port.  The port is pretty awful.  There are no graphics options, and on my machine which has specs that are way higher than the recommended setting it took me a lot of time to figure out how to get this game going at a decent framerate.  It took me a couple hours and a lot of google searches to get this game running at a playable framerate, and if your computer is below the recommended specs and closer to the minimum specs, you may have some issues getting this game into a playable state.  I ended up having to download some 3rd party software to even get the game to run at around 30 FPS.  30 FPS is a bit low, but I don't mind it on this game.  The game was actually designed to be run at 30 FPS from what I can tell, so if you can get it higher that is great but 30 works just fine.  Even though the port of this game sucks, I still would recommend this game especially if you can get it on sale.  Since the game is short, it might be a really good deal to wait for the sale.  I got it for 7.49 and it is definitely worth the price.  If you are an old school Sonic fan, you owe it to yourself to get this game because it truly is the best sonic game to come out this decade.

												Sonic Generations is a blast from the past that I'd recommend any Sonic fan to play. With the game starting at the zone that started it all, Green Hill Zone, and going all the way to Planet Wisp, Sonic Generations was a serious nostalgic trip that any classic sonic fan or modern fan would have a good time playing. The game also sports a pretty awesome soundtrack! Classic Sonic's varation of the stages have a 90's/Genesis feel added to the songs and Modern Sonic's varation resembles the music style of how Sonic's music sounds today! When it comes down to rating the game I'd give it a 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For years, Sonic The Hedgehog had been dead to most of us.  Sonic Colors on the Wii set a lot of that right, but Sonic Generations cements the blue pincushion's return to starring in great games. This game is full of nostalgia for sure, but it'd be cynical to think that's all Sonic Generations has to offer.  The game just plays, looks, and sounds as fantastic as a modern-day Sonic game should, and you'd be doing yourself a huge favor in picking up the PC version.			",280,60,2,29,8,1,17

												Like Skyrim with fast11/10 would fast againRight now to the real review:Sonic Generations came out back in 2011, so I am a little late to the party. But I might as well convince you to buy the game anyway.Sonic Genrations takes Sonic and Co. on an adventure through Sonic's past. Classic stages such as Sonic 1's Green Hill Zone and Sonic Adventure 2's City Escape re-imagined for both modern Sonic, and classic Sonic. Modern Soinc plays the same as he does in the Unleashed Daytime Stages, and in Sonic Colours, sans wisps. (There is actually a mod called the Unleashed Project that brings stages from Unleashed onto PC). Classic Sonic plays like he does in Sonic 2, 3, and Sonic & Knuckles.Both Sonics control very well. Controls can be a little sensitive at times but it's not a major problem.The story is good, not great. But Sonic isnt as story-centrc as other games, so it's no big deal. A monster called the Time eater rips apart space and tme and Sonic saves the day with his past self.The game has a surprisingly large modding community. There's  stage mods (The Unleashed Project, the STH2006 Project), and mods to replace sonic with Metal Sonic, Shadow, Silver, Blaze.... The list goes on and on.There however a few problems I've had with the game, mainly being fps drops down as far as 10-15 at some times, however that may just be my hardware. (Intel HD 4000)Overall I highly recommend this game to new and old Sonic fans alike. A blast of nostalgia for old fans and a Greatest Hits/Quickstart for new fans.Sonic Generations gets a solid 8/10			",162,5,10,12,11,2,10

												TL;DR Sonic Team finally made a Sonic game that isn't terrible.Now all they have to do is get rid of every character that isn't Sonic or Robotnik.This is one of the only modern Sonic games that isn't complete garbage. Sure, it still has the characters, dialogue, and story that makes you want to gouge your eardrums out with a rusty machete, but we're not talking about that. That's easy enough to ignore.The gameplay itself is Sonic. There is no stupid were-hog mechanic, no glitches that make you run through the ground, and no NPC fetch-quests that turn the game into torture.Of course, the developers couldn't be bothered to add keyboard prompts, so be sure to have the 360 controller ready. Actually, this game is pretty much unplayable on a keyboard, but with a gamepad it actually manages to be fun.			",97,8,2,6,8,0,1

												So, I've been out of the Sonic loop for a looooong time. I played 1-3K as a kid and loved them, and recently played Adventure 1 & 2, and that's pretty much it. Since I'd heard so much praise for this game (and absolutely ADORED its soundtrack), I thought I'd give it a go, and oh. Mah. GAWSH! I had no idea Modern Sonic would be so freaking FAST! Adventure fast was fast enough for me, but this took it up a level and a half. I'm not complaining, I was just in for quiiite the trip! It's still a lovely nostalgia trip of a game, and while not extremely difficult and lacking in plot, the gameplay and soundtrack are perfect enough to keep you playing for hours, even if you're not ready for SUPER-HYPER-OMEGA--LUDICROUS-SPEED-SANIC!Tl;Dr: Good game, worth the price, play it, be ready for fast!

												This is a ridiculously good Sonic game.  After playing all of these recent Sonic games that kinda suck, I didn't really think there could be another good Sonic game.  I'm really glad this game proved me wrong, because this is Sonic at his best.  You play through the game as “classic” Sonic and “new” Sonic.  There are many different stages that are all based on classic sonic levels.  The look and music will make you super nostalgic if you played Sonic on the Genesis back in the day.  When you are classic Sonic, you go through the level just like in the original game as a 2D side scroller.  The graphics are great, and the gameplay in these sections is pure classic Sonic.  When you are new Sonic, you play through the game in a racing style.  It almost reminds me of Sonic R on the Sega Saturn but a million times better, because Sonic R SUCKED.  Anyway, these sections are just as fun.  You get to run through the level as quickly as possible and you lock onto enemies more like the new sonic games.

												Sonic has gone back to its roots of high speed platforming fun. My favourite Sonics were the originals and Sonic adventure 1&2. As this game combines the two game types it is very good. After Sonic Adventure 2 the whole Sonic franchise kinda went a bit mental and very poor in my opinion. This game is a must for any Sonic fan, I have only played a little a the moment but I am very please with what I see. Congrats Sonic team on the 20 years. 10 years of glory, 10 years of games I'm willing to forget and on the 20th year another gem!			",127,29,30,7,28,0,22

												El juego definitivo si eres fan de Sonic. Todo está cuidadísimo y es muy muy fiel a los juegos clásicos que reedita. La música es sublime, conservando las composiciones clásicas pero versionadas magistralmente. La gran pega es que esta versón de PC es un desastre, no detecta las tarjetas gráficas nvidia y hay que hacer malabares para que funcione, además la configuración de opciones va en un launcher externo que apesta y NO FUNCIONA. El juego en sí es grandioso, pero no cometas el error de pagar por la versión de PC, cómpartelo para consola, membrillo.			",253,81,6,28,15,4,34

												Sonic Generations is a game that in large part takes players back to the old days of Sega and some of the darker hours. It's graphics are crsip with a strong and dynamic color pallet that makes the objects wizzing past you seem just as interesting and vibrant as the blue blur. However this strong graphical integrity also gives way to a a large degree of framerate drops as the game trys to catch up with Sonic's speed. The music in the game is on point and includes remixes and reworkings of many older tracks, and if you dare you can collect all of the extra 50 of tracks from Sonic games including some you may not have even heard of (granted not all of the extra tracks are as good as the remixes). My only qualm with this is that the ost was not included in the extras room, so if you like any of the level themes the only way to hear them is in the levels themselves. As far as the story goes the game is sub-par, but it's a sonic game so the story doesn't really matter that much. Sonic and friends are having a birthday party when a giant black monster swoops out of the sky and throws them back in time. From there sonic and tails have to reunite their friends with the help of some strangers, themselves. See, pretty basic. But don't worry the gameplay will keep you going. The gameplay by the way is everything we've wanted from a sonic game to date. it's fast and the controlls are tighter then they have been. Gameplay comes in two forms, the 2.5D side scrolling classic levels, which are just like sonic 2 in their design, with no exception. These levels are fair and each one introduces some new mechanic to the 2d movement, so it stays fresh. These are of solid level design (except Crisis City which has a floating on cars section and the models of the objects your riding are really poorly positioned).  Secondly the 3d modern levels exist and while their controls are refined (no mach speed setions), they still go very very very fast. So expect to only play these for five minutes tops. Honestly I think other then Planet Whisp taking too long and the inclusion of  Sonic 0'6 in the set of levels (as it leaves a bad taste in the mouth of anyone who played Sonic 0'6. ugh, memories) these levels were also very solid. Sonic can be hard to control due to his speed, but that's expected. So to sumarize:- PROS- Great visuals- Great OST- Massive collection of Nostalgia- Improved level design- Classic and modern sections- Cons- Mediocre Story telling- Framerate drops- Crisis City Refection level (sonic 0'6)- little to no replay value  However what about completing the game? This will require you to get all S ranks on main levels, beat hard mode on every boss, and collect every red ring. You will have to do every single mission (but you don't need an S rank), and my personal hell: Beat the final boss without taking damage. And you will get nothing for this, pas completing the collection room full of artwork and music from preivious games. And while this is cool it does nothing to encourage me to play again, or get the other random achievements. And all you need to get that ""completiton bonus"" is S ranks on leves (for abilities), Missions complete, and all red rungs. You don't have to do hard mode or even beat the final boss. So in short, the completion of this game is hard fought at times ( as the final boss is played as supert sonic so you have no freaking idea what taking damage actually means since YOU HAVE NO HEALTH BAR) and it's just not worth it. So FINISH IT. don't bother completing the game.So finally my rating for this game is 7.5/10 , Finish it.			",69,7,0,4,3,0,8

												Pros Old and new sonic stages remade for this game! Amazing remixed sound track! Graphically impressive for a sonic game IT'S JUST SONIC! No nonsense with shadow, silver, etc Powered up/new abilities with modern sonic makes game interesting Classic sonic stages feel classic yet great, and some of my favorite stages Bosses are fun, albeit a little easy outside of the end boss Colors everywhere! Cons Story is a little simple, but it's a sonic game, so it makes senseA little on the short side This port isn't the best. Constant issues with configurations Not many graphical options  The short missions that are required for you to do to get chaos emeralds are a little dull and kinda over extend the game Overall, Sonic Generations is amazing. One of the best sonic games I've played. Me and my little nephew play this game all the time and we love it. I hope Sega goes back to this style of sonic games. 8.5 out of 10.			",40,1,0,4,1,0,0

												Fab game. Why? Simple. Fixes everything that was wrong with Unleashed. Fast paced, great remakes of old stages from past games. 18 levels (thats 2 acts per zone and thats 9 zones) and a sh*t load of stuff to unlock and bonus challenges. What more can you ask for? I can tell you what you can ask for. Mods. This game is amazingly modable and I myself have played the Sonic Unleashed Day stages, levels from Sonic Adventure, Colours and even a few from Lost world. This game is perfect, replayable and best of all, (if you know how to mod) you can in some way create the perfect sonic game for you. Totally recommend this game. Im a massive Sonic geek and from me one of the best games this past decade of sonic games.			",45,9,1,6,3,1,5

												This is the first Sonic game I've played in a while that not only just ""doesn't suck,"" but is AMAZINGLY GOOD.  Everything from 144hz monitor support (a rarity for side scroller action-type games) to unlockable classic Sonic music (Sonic R, anyone?)  makes this game a must-own for console aficionados like me.  A bit on the difficult side, but I like the balance.  My son is 5 years old, and has loved playing this even if it was a bit fast for him.  -=9/10=-			",204,18,5,16,2,1,6

												Very excellent game here. I enjoy playing this, and I just love seeing stages like Seaside Hill and City Escape remade. It makes sense why Sonic's 20th anniversary was a huge success, unlike his 15th. Despite the fact that no new music is introduced, having our favorite stages with their remix makes up for it. This is why Sonic won't die, despite the fact that Sonic's franchise are notorious for having really bad games. Most say Sonic was ruined when it became a 3D game, but the dreamcast games proved that wrong, and then we have a game like this, released only 5 years ago. This is a Sonic game that will forever be remembered for how amaizng it is, unlike *cough* Sonic 06.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A mix of classic Sonic style and what a modern Sonic game should be. The modern sonic levels can be buggy sometimes, but notthing game breaking. The game gives you that sense of speed that every sonic game should. Its always nice to have a game that is conscious of how rediculous it is, so it doesn't try being serious like some past entries. The perfect example is theres is a part where a giant semi truck is driving on the side of a building with rocket boosters and robotic saw arms chasing you. My main complaint is that most of the boss fights are pretty lame, especially the final boss.Overall though, this is a fantastic game and possibly the only good Sonic game we'll see in a long, long time.

Another strong point of this game is its soundtrack; every part of it is phenomenal.The game may be short but it has tons of replay value. There are red star rings to collect, challenges to complete and the game is fun and the levels are beautiful enough that you'll want to play them more than once.SEGA and Sonic Team have found a gameplay formula that works really, really well and I'm hoping to see it improved upon in the next Sonic game.

La gran pega es que esta versón de PC es un desastre, no detecta las tarjetas gráficas nvidia y hay que hacer malabares para que funcione, además la configuración de opciones va en un launcher externo que apesta y NO FUNCIONA.

The game isn't difficult to pick up and play, but there are a lot of inside jokes and references that only someone who has played past games will understand. If you're looking for a first Sonic game, I would recommend picking a different game, tbh. But if you've played any of the older Sonic games, whether they be the classics on Genesis, or the Adventure series, or even Unleashed or Colors/Colours, then definately pick this game up.

												""Sonic games are bad! They are buggy, the camera can't keep up, and the control is awful!"" It's time to forget all that.Sonic Generations features some of the tightest controls I've seen in a Sonic game, a vivid reimaging of Sonic levels from the past, and an excellent soundtrack. Both 2D and 3D sonic are fun to play as, and each level has a remix based on which character you play. That being said, there are some occasions where the camera does bug out. However, this only happens on rare instances. Furthermore, I have not run into any other bugs I can remember during the 5 hours it took to finish the story.Besides the main story, there are many challenges to keep you busy. In conclusion, this is the Sonic game you were waiting for.			",243,32,5,13,6,2,26

												Even though I have some INSANE lag while playing the game, I don't care about it. The story is incredible, great level designs; but there is one problem, and it is the controls. I do not have a controller, and so I use the keys A and D to move, W and S to look up and down, down arrow key to jump (which is annoying and took me some time to get used to it), right arrow key to crouch and left arrow key to do the spinning thing. Let's just say that you need to add control editing so not only me but other people can make the controls however they want. And add the ability to change the video settings, to remove some lag.So I do recommend it for people who have controllers and fast computers, but if you're a PC gamer and you hate having lag, just don't.

												Extremely clever level design with diverging paths through each level, encouraging level replays to get the fastest time and pursue S-rank scores. 2D sonic levels are fast and feel very smooth in general, and include most of the classic physics, controls, and sounds. These levels are usually shorter than their 3D counterparts, but have a great flow.3D levels are a bit more platforming-heavy, but still have some very fast parts, and Modern Sonic's homing dash and boost abilities are put to good use. These levels do not flow quite as well as the 2D levels, but are visually striking and still manage to feel good. Challenge levels range from fun level variations to frustrating gimmicks, but are largely decent twists on the gameplay, and are mostly optional for the main story. The soundtrack is wonderful, containing remixes of many level themes from throughout the series. The story is pretty much a throw-away but frames the coming-together of classic and modern Sonic decently enough to not be distracting. Although the final level and boss battle fall a bit flat, the game is overall a joy to play.			",570,191,11,107,42,4,91

												Wow. Just... wow. If you like sonic, or even just platforming in general, get this game. Period.It runs at an amazing 60 fps on my PC at high settings on a 32"" hdtv, and looks absolutely gorgeous. Like, really. This is the best a sonic game has ever looked. It has full controller support that's as easy as plugging in a wired xbox 360 controller, going into this game's settings, choosing to use the xbox controller, and starting the game. And unlike other games designed for a keyboard/mouse that are just compatible with a controller, this game is truly designed for a controller and is 70 times better with one. So, if you have a wired xbox 360 or ps3 controller hanging around, use that.This is a perfect combination of classic and modern sonic. It literally has a remade version of levels from nearly every one of the main console sonic games for both classic sonic (who makes an amazing return in HD), and modern sonic (who is even better then before!).If you're a sonic fan, get this. There's so many references to sonic games from all eras that even if you've only played one sonic game you'll probably understand a lot of them. But that makes you think ""Oh. Well, I have to be a sonic fan to enjoy this."" No. Not at all! Even if you're not a sonic fan and/or have never even played a sonic game, I still say get this. You may not understand all the references, so it won't be AS enjoyable, but it's still the best sonic's ever been in 3D (in my opinion) and it really isn't complicated. It's a platformer, after all. It's still built off of the basic platforming base. Just run and jump. There's just more stuff added on top of that.My only complaint is that this game is too short. They put a lot of effort into it, which is great, but they took so much time on making sure it was enjoyable that in the end they had to make a huge amount of rehashed missions for each stage just so they could actually sell this as a game with enough content to keep you going for more then a day. However, there is an online mode. That's right, this game has a mode in which you can race to the end of a stage as fast as possible and put your best time on the leaderboards. It's great fun replaying a stage 100 times just to try and beat that one record. It also has a ""30 second trial"", in which you have 30 seconds to try and see how far you can get in one stage. Once your time runs out, the length you traveled in the level is posted to the leaderboards. The best part, though, is that the PC version solves the ""too short"" problem entirely because of mods. There are so many mods for this game you'll never run out of stages to play. One mod ports all the levels from sonic unleashed on xbox 360/ps3, one ports stages from Sonic 06, one ports stages from sonic adventure, there are even mods that have entirely new stages in them, such as ""Meponterations"". And with new mods being made every day, you'll never get bored.In brief, this is an amazing piece of art and probably the best sonic's ever been in 3D. Well, maybe not the best, but at least the best in the last decade. Overall I recommend this. 9/10....Yes, I'm bad at reviewing games. xD			",18,3,2,1,5,0,0

												Do two Sonics really make one great adventure?Heck Yeah!Seeing as Sonic's 23rd birthday is coming up I thought I might as well leave a review for this game. So what do I think? Well, apart from the return of a horrible level from a horrible game (I'm looking at you, Crisis City), SONIC GENERATIONS is one of the best Sonic games of all time. If you like boost-to-win gameplay with pretty much no challenge, modern sonic is your guy. On the other hand, if you grew up in the days of Blast Processing and being able to do what Nintendon't, then Classic Sonic is the pudgy little mascot for you. Effortlessly switching between Sonic and Sonic on the hub is great, whilst still keeping the loading times down to keep the immersion from breaking.All of the 9 stages have been excellently recreated, my personal favourite being City Escape (both Classic and Modern). Whilst Omochao can be annoying, he can be turned off if you want to do so. Comparing this game to the HD Console versions is easy. This is the one to get, largely because of the modding community! From '06 physics to Adventure Style Sonics, from a Real Hedgehog to Rayman character mods, even from Shrek to Hatsune Miku character mods, this game's modding community has it all!Final Verdict: If you get the chance, spend the money! And check out the various mods available, as they will undoubtedly extend your playtime with this! On a side note, for a better representation of that Blast Processing gameplay, check out the 3DS version of the game! The 3DS version isn't much, but will keep you Sonic Fans happy for a couple of hours, especially with some exclusive levels from past handheld Sonic Games...well, two (Water Palace, Tropical Resort DS Version).The perfect gift for any Sonic fan, whether they want to learn the Boost-To-Win gameplay, or if they want to keep doing what Nintendon't, or even if they just want to celebrate the 20th anniversary of one of the best gaming mascots of all time!A Way Past Cool 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After some flops in the Sonic franchise (Sonic '06, Secret Rings, etc.), this game gets the series back on it's feet, and then it does a backflip and wins the World Cup. In other words, it's really great.Story: Sonic from the past and present, along with their friends, get sucked into a limbo of sorts. After playing through a few areas, the two meet up. Then they decide they need to help save his friends and return the locations back to the real world- erm, the games real world, the sonic world, Mobius. It's a really good plot. it engrosses the player, it does take a bit to start up however. It's still, nontheless, a great storyline. [Score: 8.5/10]Presentation: The graphics for this game are amazing. I originally bought it for the PS3, then recently bought it on Steam as part of a Collection of Sonic games. The PC graphics are undoubtedly better, although you can't hate the PS3's graphics on this game either. The game looks great. [Score 10/10]Gameplay: There are 2 Styles of gameplay, Classic Sonic, and Modern Sonic. Classic Sonic goes back to the roots of the series. Sidescrolling bliss. Modern Sonic goes with the style of playthrough from daytime Unleashed and all of Colors (save for the double jump). Not too much to say about it. Tight controls, high-speed gameplay, it's all really great. [Score 10/10]Level Design: This game was released for Sonic's 20th Anniversary. This is probably why it remixes old stages from other games. The only new stage is the final boss. However, this isn't a bad thing, far from it! This is one of the many reasons this game was so successful. There are 5 stage types, Regular Stage Act 1, Regular Stage Act 2, Mini-Bosses, Bosses, and the final boss. The Regular Stages are for Classic, and Modern, respectively. The Minibosses are unlocked halfway through 3 of the 4 areas of the main hub. They are just reimaginings of older versions of bosses from older games. We have Metal Sonic from Sonic CD, Shadow from Sonic Adventure 2, and Silver from Sonic '06 (but acctually playable). The Boss fights, with the exception of the last one, are throwbacks to other final (or close to final) bosses from other games. These include: Death Egg Robot from Sonic 2, Perfect Chaos from Sonic Adventure, and Egg Dragoon from Sonic Unleashed. Each fight is really solid. The Final boss is Time Eater, in which Modern and Classic sonic both go super and you take them out in a way similar to The True Final Boss in Sonic 3 & Knuckles' The Doomsday Zone. My only real gripe is that Time Eater is a little bit unforgiving, it took me a few tries to beat it. That or I just suck. [Score 9.5/10]Music: Along with the stages, the music is remixed from their respected stages (again, with the exception of the final boss), they are all really good. Some of my favorites include Death Egg Robot, Chemical Plant Zone Act 1, Metal Sonic, and my personal favorite, Time Eater. [Score 10/10 (although I wish it could be higher)]Total Score: 48/50Thank you for taking the time to read this, and Good Night.			",38,7,2,7,6,1,4

												Sonic Generations remixes levels throughout Sonic history, both in the 3D style and classic 2D style. It succeeds at finding the best parts of it's source material without changing any iconic themes. Best of all, it understands the core of what distinguishes Sonic from other platformers: rewarding good play with a feel of speed. This is demonstrated by the speed-run features, such as compartive time when reaching check points and with the classic ""higher roads are faster, but more challenging"" design philosophy.

Plus, all of the challenges to do aside from the actual runs of the levels add a bit of variety to the game, so you never have to just constantly run through the levels, knowing exactly where you're to go next.I would've hated to be on the team that picked the levels to incorperate.

												Sonic Generations  takes what Sega started with Sonic Unleashed's daytime stages and its work in Sonic Colors and improves upon it immensly, the number of cheap deaths are almost non existant and gone are the days of being able to run off the side of the level trying to take a turn.  The graphics are a beautiful colorful style when they need to and Crisis City finally gets the good treatment it deserves.   The only downsides to the game I can see is that we  got three city themed stages overall when we could have gotten more variety by picking some other levels and a lack of an ice themed level.  However I feel these are more prefence than actual detractors t the game.    The only two bugs I run into is that Online Timeattack play can sometimes crash the game and that if you change your computer set up you might need to do a fresh install of the game due to it constantly wanting you to check your settings.   That bug is made better by the fact that the game uses cloud saving. Overall I highly recommend this game to any person who played Sonic back in the 90s or even still to this day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic Generations is a fun game with both relaxing and very hard levels! The Good about this game is that there are so many levels to play in the game, so whenever you feel like playing a level, you got A LOT too choose from! There are also many characters from Sonic to Silver to Knuckles! Of course there are also many more such as Tails, Amy, Blaze, and Shadow, + More!  Even though u got some characters that are not playable such as Omacho, you still can download mods to play some characters that never made it to the game as well as characters that aren't even in the Sonic Franchise! The Bad about this game is that there is a major amount of difficulties in the levels and they start to put you in RAGE MODE! Also, Sonic's character glitches a lot  when he's speed boosting and it could take a long time too get use to the controls! In all, I think this is a great way to celebrate the 20th year of Sonic and this game would get a rating of 8 out of 10 stars in my opinion!-NickTendo69			",20,0,0,0,3,0,0

All in all, a very good buy.			",89,4,1,5,5,0,9

												Sonic Generations is a fun game with both relaxing and very hard levels! The Good about this game is that there are so many levels to play in the game, so whenever you feel like playing a level, you got A LOT too choose from! There are also many characters from Sonic to Silver to Knuckles! Of course there are also many more such as Tails, Amy, Blaze, and Shadow, + More!  Even though u got some characters that are not playable such as Omacho, you still can download mods to play some characters that never made it to the game as well as characters that aren't even in the Sonic Franchise! The Bad about this game is that there is a major amount of difficulties in the levels and they start to put you in RAGE MODE! Also, Sonic's character glitches a lot  when he's speed boosting and it could take a long time too get use to the controls! In all, I think this is a great way to celebrate the 20th year of Sonic and this game would get a rating of 8 out of 10 stars in my opinion!-NickTendo69			",20,0,0,0,3,0,0

												After the release of the adventure series Sega have struggled to bring fans a game that was as good or better, with some entries, like Sonic unleashed actually being good (not counting any night stages) to the rushed and unfinished black sheep of the series released way back in 2006. That one game along with just passable entries released on down the line saw a lot of fans turn away from the franchise but I can tell you that this game is without a doubt the best Sonic game since Adventure 2.Throughout the game you take on the role of classic sonic, who is played more like the original games in the style of 2D side scrolling but in more of a 2.5D type of style.And of course you take control of modern Sonic who controls in more or less the same way as in Unleashed with some  side scrooling sections thrown in as well.As a long time fan of the series it is really great to see that Sega can still make good Sonic games though the furure of the series is still up for debate with Nintendo now helping out for the next few games which probably means that we are going to see a rapid decline in fast paced gameplay and too much 'family friendly' content as shown by lost world and colours.But overall if you are a fan of the series than you should definately think about buying  the game because it is filled with nostalgia, great gameplay and loads of replayability.Though there are some bad points about the game, these points being that the game is only about 4 to 5 hours and all of the voice actors (with the exception of Eggman as his voice actor was the only one that didn't change after unleashed) are really bad even though some of them have done better in other performances.Closing score: 97/100			",150,39,0,2,3,0,0

												It’s been 20 years since Sonic rolled into the realm of games, and with him he’s brought us speed, clever level design and wonderfully imaginative set pieces. He has, however, also brought with him hideous 3d cameras, piles of buggy messes and a hedgehog who drives a jeep and carries a gun. Mixed legacy? You bet it is, and nowhere is the schizophrenic nature of the series better displayed than in the historically minded “Sonic Generations”. Is the blue blur back to his best, or is this simply another false start?Sonic Generations begins optimistically, blasting through Green Hill Zone before being introduced to a charmingly “nod-nod wink-wink” opening cutscene that hints at a more light hearted Sonic adventure than other games have attempted. This reassuringly fun opening is cemented when, after finishing the first level with modern sonic, you think that you’re safe. Modern Sonic played fine, Classic Sonic was great, maybe we’re going to make the long haul here, maybe we can see the game through and not hit any major speed bumps. This goes on throughout the first third of the game, the level design is charming, the cutscenes are small and for the most part amusing, and the music is great. Then something happens, and a cold sweat sits in.Challenges? There are challenges between the levels? The pulse quickens and blood drains from the face. Oh no. They surely didn’t mess this up, they were doing so well! Please don’t make me replay the same level to pad out gameplay please don’t... then the first genuine surprise happens. The challenges are not only really fun; they’re entirely different levels, for the most part! New power-ups are dished out in the form of Sonic’s friends and the level design shifts entirely. OK so these levels are much shorter, but they’re good, they’re fun, and best of all they take about 5 minutes at their most extravagant.Then the first boss fight happens. It’s a mess; spotty controls, frustrating design and uninteresting music leads to the first true lull in the game. You can forgive it though, it isn’t too bad and it ended quickly once you figure out how to hurt the boss. But then you open up the Dreamcast era, and like Sonic does when he needs to go quicker, it goes downhill from there.It’s incredible how Sonic Generations manages to pinpoint the exact moment Sonic jumped the shark but the history lesson is well taught. The level they chose from Sonic Adventure is a city level. The level they chose from Sonic Adventure 2 is a city level. The level they choose for Sonic 2006 is a city level. Suddenly it becomes very apparent that Sonic stopped existing in a sort of fantasy realm and started becoming an urbanite. All of the charm starts to drain, the level design gets, not exactly harder but more finicky, there’s more awkward jumps and bad precision platforming. Even worse are the glitches which suddenly pop up in Modern Sonic; blasting through walls, clipping on the edge of a platform and falling your death. Throw in more unexpected and unfair traps and it all gets a bit frustrating. Classic Sonic seems lost and bewildered in these later levels, outside his 3 games he has to wade through 6 modern titles and in almost every single one of them he is chased by something. I know Sonic being chased is a fun idea, but my god the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ must be magnetic or something.This is Sonic Generations biggest problem, while it’s great to celebrate Sonic’s past, it’s his present that is the true villain of the piece. What’s baffling is how the designers missed a trick in doing as little of the bad Sonic games as possible. They chose to include Sonic Heroes and Sonic 2006, and both of the “new levels” for those games are horrible. Why on earth recognise these infamously bad titles when you could have had a proper Sonic 3 level (the one in the PC version is Sky Sanctuary, a fine level but from Sonic and Knuckles) and brought in Sonic CD for a real nostalgia trip. Instead we get a bad beach level and a third (third!) city level. A terrible decision was made in development, but it could have been worse, we at least didn’t get a Shadow the Hedgehog level.Towards the end the game feels like it might be getting a little stale, so it stops. With only 9 levels, and only 2 Sonics to play them with, Sonic Generations is short, but rightly so. The challenges become a little more cumbersome and tricky towards the end, and the final bosses are a teeth gnashing nightmare, but they are at least beatable. With 90 challenges to play and time trial modes to master some players will get tons out of the end game, but most users will be satisfied to put down the game after the final foe is foiled. I certainly am, and it’s an amicable separation, for £20 I felt I got what I paid for, and the game seems to breathe a sigh of relief that I’m asking no more of it.As Sonic games go, Generations is a fun tribute. It remixes its ancestry but adds little to the series other than a recognition of when to bow out. Classic Sonic was fun to see again, but I doubt he’ll be back and it’s perhaps better that way, he’s had his day and now it’s his older, more jaded self that has to prove his worth. Modern Sonic is not redeemed by this title, and the later levels remind you that he still has his fair share of issues. But maybe he can move on, maybe someday we’ll get that 9/10 Sonic game that blows us away. This, though, is not that game, but it seems it was never meant to be. Short, silly and satisfying, Sonic Generations is a snacky game, not an epic event, and it’s nice to see something that knows its limitations. No melodrama, no over the top score, a fun run through the past of one of gaming’s most contentious icons and then off home with a smile on your face. It’s a better tribute than it ought to be.*Game time has since been oosted by the incredible Sonic Unleashed Mod that adds the levels of Sonic Unleashed to the roster. Highly reccoomended.

												So my first proper review, and what way to start it off with one of the best Sonic games ever, even if it is simply a load of past stages recreated.The cutscenes are greatly improved from the Xbox 360 version, no longer looking pixilated, well for me anyway. It also runs at a very nice and plesent 60 FPS, making Sonic and his vibrant surroundings look georgous no matter what. The game as a whole looks fantasic as it is, from the cheerful rolling hills of Green Hill Zone, to the gritty and action-packed Crysis City.The stages are so much fun. Each course is littered with secrets and alternate routes that I am still discovering every time I go back to shave precious milliseconds off your high scores. They really are a blast to play and feel unique from one another but not too gimmicky, which Sonic games have felt like in the past. As well as stages we each fight a classic boss at the end of the Era, either being the final boss of a previous game or a rival character (wait, how is Silver here?). The rivals are cool and interesting ideas, and well executed, along with the other bosses. I would have to say my favourite rival is Shadow, it feels just so... right, and it's an amazing update to fight in Sonic Adventure 2. I also love the Death Egg Robo as one of the bosses, all it's phases are just awesome and mix up the battle.But obviously, the highlight of this game is the music, as expected. I love every single one of the remixes (errr... minus Planet Wisp and another Open Your Heart remix, they got butchered) and is my favourite soundtrack next to Sonic 3 & Knuckles and Sonic Adventure 2. From the incredible violins in Rooftop Run to the tears of manliness I cry when I hear City Escape for the 7 billionth time.  Just take some time to listen to it, you'll love it.However, having said that, there are some minor complaints. The game as a whole is a bit short, it'll take you roughly 2-3 hours to complete and even less if your a veteran of the series. The Red Rings add a little more time to 7-9 hours and are a nice reward and incentive for you to discover and explore the stages and it's many routes. Also, the game is very easy. For me anyway, I got most S-Ranks first time. I also find myself going back to Modern Sonic more than Classic Sonic, despite so many people yarning for his return.Overall, this game is amazing, for what there is of it. It may be short, and easy, but if your just looking for some high-speed-nostalgia-trippin'-rocking-beats-blue-burred blast, this is the game for you. A great way to celebrate Sonic's 20th anniversary and a perfect example that the hedgehog is still on top.9/10			",96,9,0,9,14,0,9

												Probably my favorite, if not, my favorite Sonic game in the franchise. Besides the fact that the game gets so fast and fun at points, and the epic sense of tingles going down your back from the bosses and stages, the music makes it even better. Personally, I loved that I could actually change the music for all of the stages and bosses to put in an epic song. While the game may seem great, it still comes with its fair share of bugs. One major issue is the Rouge Seaside Hill mission bug where the game will most likely crash. This can be avoided however using only the boost, and destroying only necessary robots. Sometimes the frame rate of the game may get slow at times, but that comes with most games anyway. Overall, I enjoy the game and I'm pretty sure most other people with a decent computer will too.

												For those of you who have played Sonic the Hedgehog and enjoyed it, you will love this game. For those of you who probably avoided teh Sonic games, I suggest getting the demo. This game is great, and runs remarkably smooth. The game has a mere 18 levels over 9 different worlds. Not particularly amazing, but those levels provide tons of replay value as you attempt to get all the S ranks. Classic Sonic is fun, but doesn't particularly evolve past what you start with. Probably why it's considered the easy mode of the game. Modern Sonic is where all the best stuff is though. Levels are varied and the speed is ever more intense. You'll find a lot of the games better moments in the Modern Sonic portions. (Though Classic is still tons of fun as well.)			",130,14,1,6,2,1,3

												Growing up with a Nintendo and Sega this brings back memories.  In this Sonic game they took all the awesome level from all the past sonic games and threw them together.  Not only that but there are two ways to play the levels.  A side scrolling 3D or a front on thrid person 3D.  The side level area's are for me a bit annoying but the main Acts rock!  The bugs have been nicely worked out... it's mostly smooth game play.  Much better than the first Sonic for Dreamcast.  Totally worth fully price, but if you can get it on sale... all the better!

With 90 challenges to play and time trial modes to master some players will get tons out of the end game, but most users will be satisfied to put down the game after the final foe is foiled. I certainly am, and it’s an amicable separation, for £20 I felt I got what I paid for, and the game seems to breathe a sigh of relief that I’m asking no more of it.As Sonic games go, Generations is a fun tribute. It remixes its ancestry but adds little to the series other than a recognition of when to bow out. Classic Sonic was fun to see again, but I doubt he’ll be back and it’s perhaps better that way, he’s had his day and now it’s his older, more jaded self that has to prove his worth. Modern Sonic is not redeemed by this title, and the later levels remind you that he still has his fair share of issues. But maybe he can move on, maybe someday we’ll get that 9/10 Sonic game that blows us away. This, though, is not that game, but it seems it was never meant to be. Short, silly and satisfying, Sonic Generations is a snacky game, not an epic event, and it’s nice to see something that knows its limitations. No melodrama, no over the top score, a fun run through the past of one of gaming’s most contentious icons and then off home with a smile on your face. It’s a better tribute than it ought to be.*Game time has since been oosted by the incredible Sonic Unleashed Mod that adds the levels of Sonic Unleashed to the roster. Highly reccoomended.

												So my first proper review, and what way to start it off with one of the best Sonic games ever, even if it is simply a load of past stages recreated.The cutscenes are greatly improved from the Xbox 360 version, no longer looking pixilated, well for me anyway. It also runs at a very nice and plesent 60 FPS, making Sonic and his vibrant surroundings look georgous no matter what. The game as a whole looks fantasic as it is, from the cheerful rolling hills of Green Hill Zone, to the gritty and action-packed Crysis City.The stages are so much fun. Each course is littered with secrets and alternate routes that I am still discovering every time I go back to shave precious milliseconds off your high scores. They really are a blast to play and feel unique from one another but not too gimmicky, which Sonic games have felt like in the past. As well as stages we each fight a classic boss at the end of the Era, either being the final boss of a previous game or a rival character (wait, how is Silver here?). The rivals are cool and interesting ideas, and well executed, along with the other bosses. I would have to say my favourite rival is Shadow, it feels just so... right, and it's an amazing update to fight in Sonic Adventure 2. I also love the Death Egg Robo as one of the bosses, all it's phases are just awesome and mix up the battle.But obviously, the highlight of this game is the music, as expected. I love every single one of the remixes (errr... minus Planet Wisp and another Open Your Heart remix, they got butchered) and is my favourite soundtrack next to Sonic 3 & Knuckles and Sonic Adventure 2. From the incredible violins in Rooftop Run to the tears of manliness I cry when I hear City Escape for the 7 billionth time.  Just take some time to listen to it, you'll love it.However, having said that, there are some minor complaints. The game as a whole is a bit short, it'll take you roughly 2-3 hours to complete and even less if your a veteran of the series. The Red Rings add a little more time to 7-9 hours and are a nice reward and incentive for you to discover and explore the stages and it's many routes. Also, the game is very easy. For me anyway, I got most S-Ranks first time. I also find myself going back to Modern Sonic more than Classic Sonic, despite so many people yarning for his return.Overall, this game is amazing, for what there is of it. It may be short, and easy, but if your just looking for some high-speed-nostalgia-trippin'-rocking-beats-blue-burred blast, this is the game for you. A great way to celebrate Sonic's 20th anniversary and a perfect example that the hedgehog is still on top.9/10			",96,9,0,9,14,0,9

However sonic generations will make you forget all about Sega's difficulties in getting sonic into 3D, because the game is one of the best games of this generation, it successfully takes the 3d sonic levels and makes them amazing, while also remembering just how good the 2d levels were and making sure that those were excellent as well, sonic generations is excellent and I look forward to sonics next game.

I would recommend this game if you are just getting into Sonic. It also has mods that you can download from the internet.

												What can I say? It's one of the best 3D Sonic platformers ever made! And it made it to PC!To be honest, when I bought this, I was expecting an easy game, with little to bo challenge, that I would be able to beat in a couple of hours (I'm looking at you Sonic Colors on the DS). Turns out I was wrong, and gladly wrong, because this game offers a great degree of challenge latter on. The levels are awesome and reminiscent of past Sonic levels, from the recognizable Green Hill Zone to the cloudy Sky Sanctuary Zone. The story is a hit or miss, way too childish and simple, I wish that Sonic games weren't targeted for a younger audience as they are now.Overall a great experience, and one of the best platformers on Steam. You don't need to be a Sonic fan to apreciate the game, but it sure helps!Edit: After playing the game a bit more to achieve 100% completion, I must add that while the controls are fine, I found myself struggling to make certain jumps (god, the frustration) and also found some glitches related to the camera - the camera stays on the side, when it should be centered, makes it hard to platform, when drifting the camera decides to wander off, that sort of thing. Also, the game often crashed when trying to play ranked time attack online, not to mention that the leaderboards are completely hacked, with people having completion times of 00m00s!Other than that, I still recomend this game.

												Sonic has had a bumpy road in 3D, but you already know that. That being said, I'm happy to admit that Sonic Generations may be the best 3D Sonic game. The gameplay is split between slower, momentum-based 2D Classic Sonic sections and fast-paced frantic 3D Modern Sonic sections. It's the best of both worlds, and both contrast each other beautifully. Seemingly small differences like Modern Sonic's boost mechanic make major alterations throught his levels and the slower more platforming centered Classic Sonic levels allow for more exploration, however both of these playstyles tend to merge and weave in and out of each other in some clever ways. You may find a section of a Modern Sonic level rithe with multiple paths and slower platforming segments or a Classic Sonic section in which you blaze by at ludicrous speeds. The game's presentation is solid, boasting bright, colorful visuals and a rocking soundtrack comprising of remixes from selected Sonic levels of the past. The whole game Sonic Generations for how much it holds on to the past, seems to be carving a new future for the blue blur that I hope SEGA will continue going down. Definatley worth you time and your money. A controller is HIGHLY reccomended and as there are little in the ways of graphical settings, make sure your rig at least meets the reccomended specs as playing this game below 60 frames per second feels very unresponsive and slow, something you don't want in a fast-paced game like this.

												This is one of the best Sonic games in a long time. It combines classic sonic 2d sidescroll platforming with the new 3rd person view platforming. Being able to play choosing either mode is great and the game can be challenging. Graphics are crisp, vibrant and it runs smooth.			",185,14,18,2,17,8,9

												This game is amazing. So much better than the previous game. However, I had much more fun with Sonic Unleashed with the glitches. That's not to say Sonic Generation's isn't a good product. It's a great product, to which I have clocked many many many hours on (on Xbox 360). The PC version is the best due to the obvious better graphics, but also the giant modding community.			",213,56,7,24,16,1,14

												Actually a pretty fun Sonic game (for once), though a couple of the bosses are really badly thought out and the mechanics make no sense until you probably go look it up online.

Lots of replayability in the challenges, however online mode seems to be broken so achievement hunters will be out of luck on a couple of them.			",125,38,2,25,7,0,13

												You will like:- Classic-style Sonic platforming brought to modern capabilities. It touches on a style reminiscent of what we saw in the Sonic Adventures here and there, but stays closer to how the Genesis games were; even in 3D.- Graphics that are colorful, stimulating, but familiar. The visuals are fantastic.- Classicly terrible Sonic storylines. The dialogue, voice acting, and just about all character animations relating to speech are charmingly awful. I consider this good; they put their effort into level design instead of telling a compelling story. That's what Sonic is for.You will not like:- SONIC'S HANDLING. Really now, how is that even a topic of discussion? In the 3D (non side-scrolling) levels, he changes direction like a pickup truck. And nothing is cool about pickup trucks. How can a furry doing parkour be bad at an entire axis?			",90,20,6,12,10,0,13

												Sonic Generations is easily the best modern Sonic game, a variety of different level designs and the option to play as young or old Sonic gives you the old 2D style Sonic platformer gameplay and the new 3D level designs.The PC port though is very flawed, the online mode is broken and will crash the game randomly.The single player mode is excellent and still makes the game worthwhile even though the online mode is broken.

												A Sonic fan gets Sonic Generations. What happens?MIND BLOW.Sonic Generations is a fantastic addition to the Sonic franchise. From the nostalgic setting of Green Hill Zone, to the bright and fresh Rooftop Run, I was hooked.Classic Sonic feels much like he did in the old days of the Genesis. He runs, he spins, you get the drill.Modern Sonic is the same as in Sonic Unleashed, but with a few tweaks to improve his control. His boost is no longer necessary for certain parts, meaning players who didn't like the boost gameplay can go back to Sonic Adventure style gameplay.The stages are a ton of fun to rush through, but they're also fun to explore. Often, if you speed through the level, you'll miss some secrets and easter eggs. City Escape is one such case. If you don't slow down, you'll miss tons of throwbacks to older titles.The graphics are INCREDIBLE. Often times, the graphics are the best I've seeen on a PC.So the game is a masterpiece, and you should get. The end, right?No.Sadly, Sonic Generations has its fair share of issues.Towards the end of your adventure, three obstacles will arise.Planet Wisp, Egg Dragoon, and (SPOILERS) the Time Eater.Planet Wisp is a mess. Not only is it 95% bland factory, but it's INCREDIBLY LONG. New players will most likely spend 7-10 minutes in this place.Egg Dragoon suffers from the length as well. The boss drags on for while, eventually succumbing to the constant homing attacks you've been spamming for the past 8 minutes. God help you if you play it on hard mode.*SPOILERS*The Time Eater is a boss that ALSO suffers in length. Maybe that was Eggman's plan: to bore you to death. Sadly, not only is this fight long, it's completely one-sided. Often times, you'll be RIGHT infront of him, about to land a hit, when he desides to jump fifty feet back!! Oh, and those, ""helpful"" friend of yours? Get used to the saying, ""It looks like a homing missle!! Be carful, Sonic!!""Thankfully, those are all the problems I had with this game.Sonic Generations is a wonderful platformer for gamers old and new. It offers a bunch of new things to keep the expierience fresh, while also borrowing just enough ideas from Sonic's past to make the ultimate Sonic tribute. If you haven't already, do yourself a favor, and BUY IT!!			",54,5,3,4,5,2,10

												If you played the mega drive/genesis sonic games, then Classic sonic's stages will bring back wonderful memories. If you played the 3d sonic games, Modern sonic's stages will give you a fleeting sense of nostalgia. After sonic 06 failed to celebrate sonic's 15th anniversary, SEGA finally made a great anniversary game rivalling sa2's celebration of its 10th anniversary with the mashup of 2d platforming and 3d adventure. a game for any sonic fan of any age.

												This is a mild recommendation. I was a big Sonic fan as a kid, so this game has a huge nostalgia value for me. The 2D Sonic levels feel great, the 3D levels are usually pretty good, and hearing a lot of the classic music from the games being remixed is fantastic.But I was a little disappointed in this game, too. I wasn't expecting to finish the game in 6 hours. That feels REALLY short to me, particularly since the game's currently selling for $30 at full price. (I, luckily, got it on sale.) There are a lot of optional challenges which I mostly haven't done, but I didn't feel like the gameplay was compelling enough to make me want to.And in the 3D levels I stumbled across some of the flaws that have plagued the series since the switch to 3D--glitches (one time I fell through the floor and died), a wonky camera (which is REALLY frustrating when you go fast) and occasionally frustrating controls (a lot of times I didn't home in on an enemy with my homing attack when I thought for sure that it should've worked--I'm not sure if it was a glitch or if I was just unclear on how it should work but either way, it was frustrating).I ended up feeling pretty luckwarm on this game, which was really disappointing considering all the praise I've been hearing about it. It DID tickle my nostalgia so I'm giving it a rec for that--the game sets out what it wants to do, pay homage to the Sonic series. If you're a fan and that's what you're wanting, pick it up. Otherwise I find this hard to recommend--there's a lot of better platformers out there on Steam nowadays. At the very least, I'd wait for this game to go on sale rather than paying full-price.

												This game is amazing. whether you play it in 40 frames per second or 60, the game looks and feels great. The game already has a ton of content, and there's tons of free mods for it including: a real hedgehog texture(it only works on modern Sonic but still looks both cool and hillarious), solo ports of levels from Colors, Adventure 1&2, even a level from the almost forgotten Shadow the Hedgehog, and most impressively a port of more than half of the daytime stages from Sonic unleashed. And although this game is almost 3 years old, there are still more mods being made, and with the Sonic GMI program you don't have to merge the mod files with the games, so all you need to do to play the original game is simply uncheck the ""enable mods"" box and you're good to go.

												This game is unbelievably fun! The story itself probably takes about 7 or 8 hours, which is kind of short, but with over 90 side missions and the amount of challenge they provide, this game will have you playing for days! The game has brilliant level design and combines the 2D and 3D aspects of both the Modern and Classic Sonic stages.Every single level in Sonic Generations is a multi-path racetrack. You'll blaze past ramps, jumps, hidden emblems and entire new depths before you realize that you could have been soaring through them with a second's more dedication. Then you'll return to right your wrongs, as a quicker and more deliberate blur of cold-calculated genius on the rollercoaster setpieces created for your driven demolition. Newcomers will flail as they collide with walls, obstacles and clocks built either to deter them from this franchise forever or beat them into determined masterminds. Dedicated gamers will, on the other hand, give this thing the asskicking it deserves, and they'll earn it by triumphing over gameplay that's both thick and balanced, instead of fighting against the insurmountably broken ideologies that weave their way into most Sonic the Hedgehog games these days. Generations is definitetly one of the best Sonic games in a while, and I highly recommend playing it.			",92,5,1,8,3,1,2

I simply love the energetic, fast-paced gameplay of both Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic, though I personally prefer Mordern Sonic's stages, but there's no denying that classic Sonic is very enjoyable as well. Plus for longtime fans of the series, it's fun to see how stages like Chemical Plant Zone and City Escape have been upgraded and changed for this version.My point is, this an awesome game for both Sonic fans and people who are just getting into the series.

But if you're a sonic fan like me you'll really enjoy the attention to detail and the general atmosphere of the game			",146,32,3,10,17,1,23

												SONIC IS BACK !!!!!Sonic Generations is the best sonic game to date. The game blends 2d with 3d gameplay and the result is a blast. The game is fast, challenging, beautiful and it’s the sonic that we remember from the Sega genesis “mega drive” era.The story is also very good and it creates nostalgia. The music score it’s also awesome and it has some old school music from the old games.  Also there are lots of unlockables and secrets here. Each level also offers alternative routs and you can explore and find various secrets. Seriously if you are a sonic fun you will need to buy this.Pros: Awesome levels, Nice Presentation, Looks great in motion, excellent level design, 2d and 3d blends perfectly, the 3d levels are fast as hell, voice acting is good, mods are available and you can play levels created by the community, high replayabilityCons: some minor bugs and some slow downs, some boss fights are boring.FINAL SCORE: 08/10I RECOMMEND TO PLAY WITH A GAMEPAD ",102,15,7,1,4,0,1

												As someone who greatly enjoyed the early sonics, I would highly recommend this to anyone who prefers the old era sonic with several nice, modern touchups.  I've beaten this game and I have enjoyed every second of it.  I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the classic feel with several very nice modern touches.			",185,42,4,37,33,0,27

												Im not even a Sonic fan or a huge platformer guy at all and this went above and beyond my expecations. The gameplay and level design is amazing making me want to go back and replay the levels over and over. The game is colorful and very crisp it is definetly a wonderfully good looking game. Overall I actually think I like this more than games like Mario galaxy. I highly reccomend this too anyone just looking for a good, fun game to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 The best Sonic game SEGA has ever created in years!  This game shows that Sonic finally broke out of the  dark ages  he was facing ever since his 15th anniversary. A lot of people argue with the gameplay elements being a reminiscent to Sonic Unleashed's 'Boost-to-win' mechanic, but it actually perfects it with genius level design. IMO, it actually outshines the 2D sections by providing tons of alternate pathways. Of course, no game is perfect and this game has its fair share of flaws, like Classic Sonic’s physics being a bit wonky and not emulating the good ol’ Genesis controls. Also, the story is an incomplete piece of garbage with bad writing and crappy voice acting (Excluding Tails, Dr. Eggman, Espio and Rouge).  BTW the Final Boss Battle is complete S H I T  ! Long time Sonic fans will appreciate the huge amount of Easter eggs, references and homages that are spread all over the game. *sigh* Unfortunately, this game is pretty short and at times you get that feeling there is something missing. It's like buying a puzzle box with a chunk of the pieces not included. You can beat this in about 3-4 hours without pacing yourself! Thanks to the HUGE modding community, you can have an endless amount of level mods extending the amount of gameplay! Most mods are often ports/recreations of past Sonic levels, so now you can replay your childhood with better controls. I'll give two separate scores for  Sonic Generations :  8.0 OUT OF 10!!!  stand alone 9.5 OUT OF 10!!!  with modsWant to enhance your experience?!

												SEGA promised the fans and they delivered. Classic sonic is back wearing the correct shade of blue jumping from platform to platform in his whole new 2D world, of course with Modern Sonic tagging along with his 'Sonic Unleashed' style stages. Sonic Generations alternates between the two Sonics as they try and subdue the villain 'cleverly' named the 'Time Eater'. There are 3 eras in the game with 3 stages within each, 2 decades of 'Sonicness' for both Classic fans and Modern fans to enjoy.As you progress through the not so great story, you will play through 1 Classic stage, 1 Dreamcast stage and 1 Modern stage all of which have 2 levels for both Modern and Classic sonic. Watching Classic Sonic 'run' not 'blast' through each stage is wonderful and fills the air around you with sweet nostalgia and success. Not to forget Modern Sonic with his finally mastered 'Unleashed' controls, playing as Modern Sonic is just as enjoyable as it was in Colours and Unleashed but this time with an extra ""uummph"".I must say SEGA have finally captured the essence of our beloved Hedgehog and have made an excellent game which makes you forget about the many mistakes they have made in the past (Sonic 06). Overall Sonic Generations is an excellent game and a 'must have', even though the game has a fairly bland and predictable plot, and not to forget that Modern Sonic is still... Well... Modern Sonic, but even with all the Complaints from other fans it seems like a meaningless excuse to just hate on our once beloved Sonic.Sonic is finally getting his s*** together not to forget that this is an improvement from his last 2 games or 3. But if you are a true fan you will buy this game, ""I mean pleeeaaasse, we all bought Sonic 06"". And with added mods from other sonic fans this game is a lot better on PC than any other console: DOpiziite - 8.4			",184,28,2,8,9,2,3

												Overall, Sonic Generations is an amazing game. If you ask me, it's the perfect way to celebrate Sonic the Hedgehog's 20th anniversary. Why? Not only do you get to play as Modern Sonic, but also Classic Sonic (he introduced me to videogames, believe it or not). So, needless to say, it can appeal to you whether you're a fan of the 2D, Genesis classics, or even the modern, 3D games. Every level has been taken from previous games in the series, all of which were voted to be in the game by the fans. One cool feature within the game is the ability to choose what music plays in the background of a level. You can unlock music through collecting red rings (returning from my favorite Sonic game, Sonic Colors) and completing challenges (a lot of which are a major pain in the neck to complete, let alone get an S-rank on). Oh, and if you were to ask me, I think people complain about the final boss fight WAY too much. It's not perfect, but it's not terrible, either (especially once you learn its attack-patterns and can collect rings efficiently). In conclusion, Sonic Generations doesn't quite have everything I expect to see from a Sonic game, but it is a masterpiece and it should be in every Sonic fan's collection.			",10,4,0,3,3,0,0

												Even though I have some INSANE lag while playing the game, I don't care about it. The story is incredible, great level designs; but there is one problem, and it is the controls. I do not have a controller, and so I use the keys A and D to move, W and S to look up and down, down arrow key to jump (which is annoying and took me some time to get used to it), right arrow key to crouch and left arrow key to do the spinning thing. Let's just say that you need to add control editing so not only me but other people can make the controls however they want. And add the ability to change the video settings, to remove some lag.So I do recommend it for people who have controllers and fast computers, but if you're a PC gamer and you hate having lag, just don't.

												This game is great for any sonic fan, especially someone who has grown up with all the different Sonic games starting from Megadrive and going from there.Every level has 2 versions to it. One as retro Sonic where it is more side scrolling adventure and the other where it is the more modern Sonic. Both have the fast pace and exciting scenery Sonic fans will love.First 3 levels are a fantastic revisit of Green Hill Zone and Chemical Plant Zone. They really are true to the Megadrive versions with same monsters, plants and a great re-make of the music. The Chemical Plant Zone really brings back all the horrors of the pink liquid.They also did an amazing job expanding the Sky Sanctuary Zone from Sonic and Knuckles which is good because in the original version the level was quite short.After that it more delves into next gen Sonic. Like Sonic Adventure, Sonic Heroes etc. Levels are great and still stay true to the original feel. I just wish they had a few more Megadrive levels, I would have love to have seen Mushroom Hill Zone, Hydro Plant Zone and Hilltop Zone (Although in the later levels there is something similar)In the later level there is some real hair pulling scenarios that almost ruin the game, especially the last bosses. Way too punishing and time consuming.Overall I would recommend this game for any long time Sonic fan wanting to revisit your favorite levels with a modern twist on them.			",261,77,5,38,66,2,34

Its insanely fast and furious as you remember the old games to be but with the polish and graphics of newly released titles. The option to play as both Sonics is quite fun and once you get used to how both of them play you will love the game. You can upgrade both Sonics with the points you earn while playing adding to a more customized version that suits your  playstyle or the challenges of the current level you want to play.

You'll most likely have a lot of nostalgia playing the game.I reccomend that every Sonic fan purchase this game. You won't regret!			",25,3,1,1,1,0,0

												Ok, first things first. Do I reccomend this? Eeeeeeeh, no. Don't buy this game. Instead, wait for a sale or get the Sonic Hits Collection(http://store.steampowered.com/sub/26498/) for about the same price which comes with this and some REALLY good Sonic titles such as Sonic Adventure DX, Sonics 1-3K and Sonic CD. If you're a fan of mediocrity then it also comes with Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic 4 and both AllStar racing games.Now, onto the game. The keyboard controls are absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ You'll need a gamepad to actually enjoy it, so make sure you have one before you get it(or alternatively get the Hits collection and play some other sonic games while you're waiting). The game is also rather short with just 9 stages with 2 acts and 10 missions each. Some of the bosses, especially the final boss, are disappointingly easy and/or frustrating Now that we have everything negative out of the way...The gameplay is solid 2d/3d Sonic action which lets you switch between modern and classic Sonic. The stages are all rather open which adds a ton to the replay value, and each level is unique and has something special. All the stages are taken from previous games, but add something new to the originals. The graphics are beautiful and the music is excellent as always. The story is just there to link the game together.The game also has great mod support and is a good PC port, with the exception of the previously mentioned♥♥♥♥♥♥controls. Overall, a good experience that I'd say is overpriced. Get the Hits Collection, seriously.			",49,4,3,1,3,1,6

												This is easily the best ""new"" Sonic game out there. Go figure since it relies heavily on nostaliga and classic mechanics. You can choose between the classic 2D type Sonic and the new 3D type for every act and level. It works surprisingly well and while both 2D and 3D leave some poor level design in its wake, it's still a lot of fun - nostalgia or not.It also looks fantastic on PC. If you want Sonic and more classic Sonic than Adventure Sonic, this game is your best bet. Decent amount of levels and lots of side stuff to do for a Sonic game. Well worth full price, I dare say, if you're a Sonic fan.			",746,134,23,93,104,10,118

												Allright, I purchased this game mostly because I heard that you get to play original Sonic 1 in it. So, yeah... After beating the act 1, I figured out that I should do it again, but now in 3d. And so I did and still nothig, so... I beat the game and finished most of the challanges in 2d and 3d, looking for the mistical Sonic 1 all around and couldn't find it anywhere. So, after spending several hours in my noble quest to be able to play Sonic 1 in PC without some sort of simulator, I gave up on my own logic and I went to consult with the oracle (Google), looking for clues of how to get to this point of the game where you'll be able to play Sonic 1... To find out, that you actually can't. Not on PC version, at least. So, yeah... That was pretty dissapointing. And the game itself is allright, though there are just like... 9 levels and 3 bosses. 18 levels, if you take in count the 3d version of those and 4 bosses, if you count the final one. So, after you beat those, welcome to the challenges and stuff. But it's enjoyable to replay some of the levels, so it's allright. Not a big fan of 3d Sonic, though.7/10.			",435,59,4,47,45,4,68

												well I must say that the game isnt running particularly fast on my laptop (~25fps, not really a problem since i even play racing game with this fps count fine), but is isnt that easy to control, especially since sonic literally doesnt seem to know when to stop and sometimes the fine steering while jumping isnt really precise so it's a bit hard to hit a small target like a jumping platform.But almost every game has positive aspects and let's rather talk about those.for Starters I think it's great to have the ability to choose the voice language to your liking and they even had the Japanese voices in it, a fact which I truly loved (and instantly enabled) since at least in my experience ENglish or German voices are usually a lot inferior to Japanese ones both in Anime and games that I watched/played.Even though it isnt perfect, in the end it isnt a bad game and the idea of combining a pure side scrolling Jump 'n Run with a 3D Jump 'n Run is great. in the end I like it. maybe the controls are better on my PC, I'll try to update this when I get a chance to play on my PC.

												OH, MY GOD!!! This has to be the best game ever!! It shouldn't be $ though. This game lasts me hours! I love the concept of the Classic Sonic, who doesn't say anything; meets the loud - mouthed Modern Sonic. There are quite a few requirements for this game, though.I reccomend you have the following...-Windows Vista at the minimum (Sorry Mac users) And I know it says XP for the minimum in the requirements, but everyone knows XP for steam is crap.-Laptop (DO NOT GET THIS ON A DESKTOP IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THE MONITOR ISSUE!!)If u only have a desktop, go into Program Files (x86)/steam/steamapps/common/sonicgenerations. From there, delete the file called configfiles.cfg, than launch the config, than launch the game.-Any Suppourted Controller (It took me 30 Mins. to configure my keyboard to the game's controls; and the controller is already configed.-Speakers and/or Headphones (This game has AWESOME music in the levels and to be able to unlock in the boss key missions).Overall, I give this game 5/5! There are some ways to get this game on permanent discount, but I didn't use those.HAVE FUN!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												// Sonic Generatio is a 2D & 3D Adventure Game: //// Schuitje82 - Extended Review //About:======Finally after years of bad games Sonic Generations is a great game.Sonic Generations is a look at the past of the Sonic games.Many levels come back from Sonic 1, 2, 3 as the adventure series.What I think it's very special that you can play all stages in 2d as 3d perspective.Overall a very unique concept that makes this game special in his own way. Story:=====Story mode is about you are facing Dr. Eggman & Time Lord (what his name is) together with Old & Next Gen Sonic.You run with both character though stages to rescue your buddies who are traped in the stages / time line.When you complete 2d and the 3d part the stage will unlock and you have saved your friend.Gore Gameplay:============The game is not only about the story mode and running.Beside the main story mode the games gives you a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of extra challanges to play.Like Time Trail, Defeating Bosses like Metal Sonic, Collecting Items with knuckles.There is so many things to do in this game this will keep you playing for hours and hours.And gives the game a good variation.There is a ingame pinball table... only this is DLC content :(Graphic & Controls:===============They did a great job with the graphic part of this game.If you PC can handle the game this game looks SuperB on Max settings.The game supports the The Xbox 360 joypad.Did not tested it with other controllers.Game plays very well and gives you the old feeling like the Sega era back in the '90.Overall:=======Game looks great, great music and really has the feel of my childhood sonic game.Score: 9--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------== For more reviews go to www.gamegrin.com ==== Please don't forget to like my reviews ==			",881,207,55,74,87,9,135

												well I must say that the game isnt running particularly fast on my laptop (~25fps, not really a problem since i even play racing game with this fps count fine), but is isnt that easy to control, especially since sonic literally doesnt seem to know when to stop and sometimes the fine steering while jumping isnt really precise so it's a bit hard to hit a small target like a jumping platform.But almost every game has positive aspects and let's rather talk about those.for Starters I think it's great to have the ability to choose the voice language to your liking and they even had the Japanese voices in it, a fact which I truly loved (and instantly enabled) since at least in my experience ENglish or German voices are usually a lot inferior to Japanese ones both in Anime and games that I watched/played.Even though it isnt perfect, in the end it isnt a bad game and the idea of combining a pure side scrolling Jump 'n Run with a 3D Jump 'n Run is great. in the end I like it. maybe the controls are better on my PC, I'll try to update this when I get a chance to play on my PC.

												Sonic Generations is a huge tribute to the most popular Sonic game, you can have both the old school sonic and the modern sonic styles of game and the most remembered scenarios and songs from previous Sonic games also has a lot of great artwork, unfortunately has several bugs and i don't recommend you to complete all the achievements.. is too hard with those bugsGameplay 8/10I loved the gameplay, you will have 9 scenarios over 2 acts, these scenarios are map inspired and almost the same from Sonic 1, 2, 3, Sonic & Knuckles, Sonic Adventure 1 & 2, Sonic The Hedgehog, Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors. Can seem that are not many maps, but you can play also over 90 challenges.Classic Sonic mode: is the classic platform mode, when you clear the challenges you can use the Electric, Fire, Bubble and Sonic 1 shields.Modern Sonic mode: is a third person mode, in which sonic can lock and hit targets and use Turbo, the third person perspective switches with a platform in several part of each map. The only thing i hate was the final boss fight, i didn't get anthing that was going on.. to much effects weird angles.. and also for me there was several maps in modern sonic that were tricky and confusing but if you play Sonic Adventure previously, this probably won't be an issue.The difficulty of the game is up to you, you can try to get S in all the stages, and make all the challenges, or simply pass the story, but all the boss fights are very easy.. like in every Sonic games the boss has simple patterns.I took me 29 hours to unlock all the Achievements, because of a bug took me some hours to figure it out. Just plaing the story with cinematics can be done in 5, you are forced to play some challenges to unlock the new stages.Graphics 9/10The graphics are pretty descent the only problem is playing using Steam Streaming, i tried but for some reason the image capture of Steam was too slow and couldn't play it that way. And the 2d to 3d charater transformation were great.Sound & Music 9/10The music and sounds are from the previous Sonic games but with a loot of more quality, brings my childhood back each time i hear the Sonic spins, hits fire shield sounds etc. I think the sound work is awesome.Bugs & stability 5/10Several times i found bugs, like the Ranked Attack maps crashes every time... i could find how to ""skip"" the bug but also has a lot of work and very frustrating...Some scenarios had a few parts with bad collision but almost never caused me getting kill.Total 7/10I totally recommend you this game if you love classics Sega Genesis Sonic i guarantee that you will enjoy it and bring your childhood back a couple of hours. I hope this review were useful to you and tanks for reading.  Regards! ",276,66,8,39,24,1,27

												This is game is amazing. I never expected Sonic to still be good after the Sonic Adventure stuff that I didn't like the direction of. Sonic Generations is like being back in the 90's playing Sonic 2, 3 and Sonic&Knuckles but with improvements. Definitely play if you've ever played and liked Sonic. You can switch between old style sonic and the new one for each level, there are tons of collectables, challenges, a cool level select area, item boosts that you can buy with points and equip.

												Incredibly fun, fast paced, and nostalgic game!Music - The music is such a huge part of the game for me. You can unlock new songs and listen to any song you've ever unlocked while play through any stage or mission. That and a few remixes in this game are just amazing. Favorite remixes are probably the Shadow's battle theme remixed, Super Sonic Racing (Generations mix), and Speed Highway (Modern remix.) But every stage has two remixes it to it (sans boss battles and side missions) that bring back lots of good and bad memories (that damn tornado, ughhhhhh.)Levels - The stages are great and some have achievements are nice little cameo appearances of one time characters appearing here and there in the background somewhere (Fang, Bean, and Polar for example appear on some posters in City Escape.) The levels have entirely nice design although I feel a few of them could have been much better done to either be harder or less of a pain to complete.Story - Same old, same old, Dr. Robotnik(s) up to their old shenanigans as per usual. Nice trip down memory lane regardless.Bonus - The hidden trophy room, good luck figuring out ALL the codes for the trophies (most likely will use a guide like I did since there's no real indication the room exist or how to find and get the codes.) The content room has the FMVs, concept art, character info, and music for enjoyment.Game play - Modern and Classic Sonic vary in play style (although you can eventually unlock Homing Attack for Classic Sonic which takes forever to do.) Classic Sonic is side scrolling and using older game style controls, Modern Sonic uses newer playing styles and can't spin dash sadly but can go into Boost Mode and pick up really nice speed.Overall, I would recommend this game, whether it be part of the bundle, stand alone, or on discount. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While it has faults, with some of the later stages slowing things down to a crawl, the majority of this game is just so much damned fun.  It really captures the essence of Sonic.  Not only are the 2d stages great, but the 3d ones work very well for the most part.  The only times that the 3d stages fall apart are when the game no longer has you pinned to a 2d plane.The story is hokey but, you know what, that's actually kind of what I want out of a Sonic game.It's hard to say much else about Generations because when the stages aren't entirely cut and pasted from other games, they're very VERY inspired from stages in previous iterations.  Unfortunately you can also gauge how entertaining they'll be based on where they came from (Hint: the sonic colors stages are awful, as are the Sonic Heroes stages).I may have said some negative things but I had an amazing time with this game and I'm very glad it existed.  Sega could stop making Sonic games right here and I would be happy because we've finally gotten a good one.  If you've ever enjoyed a Sonic game, I really think this should be in your library.

												Personally, I think this is the best Sonic game ever. It doesn't have the most detailed storyline, but that's okay. The music and levels are great on thier own, and I love replaying them. Then, there are hundreds of mods, including level ports from games such as Sonic Colors, Sonic Unleashed, and Sonic the Hedgehog (2006). Then, there are character and even physics mods. If you are just getting in to Sonic, I reccomend you play this game first, then play the games before it, then replay the levels. That's just about what I did, and it worked well for me.

												Great Sonic game. Track records make it fun to continue playing by competing against friends. Both the original Sonic and Modern Sonic game modes are fun and smoothly finished.The storyline is a little underwhelming, but throws huge tributes to the biggest games of the series' history. New players will find the game difficult and challenging, while older players will find some parts easier from previous games; but will also find a large amount of valuable nostalgia to make it worth their while.Get this game with the SEGA Collection Bundle. For $30 (or $15 on sale) this bundle is well worth the content you pay for.			",72,4,3,1,4,0,4

												This game has a bunch of Nostalgia for those who have played some of the past Sonic Games, even though it's a modern Sonic game. It has the good old Green Hill Zone, City Escape, Seaside Hill, and even Crisis City from Sonic 06, which is a game that I personally love. It even has some of the best remixes of old songs resting in it's files and some pretty good easter eggs regarding some old Sonic Characters that weren't use for years.

												Sonic has had a much bumpier career than Mario with his missing appearance on the Saturn, his first adventure into 3D having not aged too well, his first anniversary game being one of the worst games of all time (Sonic '06) and the attempts to fix the franchise afterword resorting to ripping off other non-related games (like God of War). That said, things have been looking good for Sonic ever since Colors came out and Generations does to some extent build on that momentum and even fix many of the problems with the previous 3D Sonic games. Of course much like Sonic's career, Generations has numerous flaws that keep it from reaching the peak of platforming bliss that old Jumpman set.Let's start off with the good: Generations looks and sounds great with crisp graphics, beautiful environments and some of the series best tunes in one package. Both the 2D and 3D levels are mostly fun (with a few disappointing exceptions) and in some cases even fix what weren't really fun levels before (such as '06's Crisis City). The controls are spot on and it seems they have almost perfected 3D Sonic's move set (almost, one of the missions proves that the Homing Attack is still a bit tricky) while 2D Sonic feels just like he did in the old games, which is funny given how odd Sonic 4 felt. The Story is nothing special, but it's not contrived and stupid like in Adventure 2 and '06, plus there are some funny lines here and there. Also the new not-4KIDS cast is great (even though Robotnik is still played by the same actor) and they fit the roles well without any weird ear bleeding voices making you reach for the mute button.As I said though, the game does have flaws that keep it from being a proper classic. For one thing, the game just feels padded. There are 9 levels (3 from each era: the Genesis Era, the Adventure Era and the Modern Era) with 2 acts each, 4 boss fights and 3 rival bosses. Given the general brevity of a standard Sonic level, this makes the game sound a bit short, even compared to other Sonic games. This is where the missions come in. In order to gain access to a boss of a given era, you have to get a key from each of the 3 levels. You get a key by completing missions (there are 5 for each level for both old and new Sonic), which you really only have to beat 1 of in each level. This is thing though; if you are only expected to do 1 per level, then why not just add a 3rd act? Reusing the existing level's assets for random missions just feels like they were tacked on at last minute or added to save money and really they just feel like filler. Franky, adding a 3rd act and just having the missions be completely optional would have been the better option.The other issue is that the missions them selves are mostly not fun. In fact a few are what I'd call ""anti-fun"" (the Vector music note one is one of the worst things I've ever played in my life). I can think of several that were no fun at all, but can't think of one that was fun off the top of my head. I'm sure there were a few, but they just don't leave an impression on you. The other issue is that while they fixed many levels that weren't fun in old games, they actually ruined one that was fun, that being Planet Wisp. I personally love Sonic Color, so I was excited to see what this level was like, but I was saddened to see that they didn't use any actual level from the game. I can understand for the 2D act (which was even less fun), but not the 3D one. How could they keep the '06 level mostly intact and then just ignore all the levels in Colors? What a waste.Those problems aside, Generations is still a fun game overall and well worth any Sonic fan's time. I'm not sure if I'd recommend it for new fans, maybe check out Colors or even Unleashed first or hell, just buy the Steam bundle that comes with 12 games for free and play the old games in order. There is really no reason not to.I give Sonic Generations an 8.0 out of 10.			",98,14,3,6,1,0,1

												The gameplay is pretty fun but I don't think it's worth the full price, next time there is a sale you should consider buying. The stages themselves are great nostalgia trips and the level design is very much in touch with their respective games. The final boss however is confusing and I had to restart many times and still I didn't understand the method of defeating him without running out of rings (hint hint). Overall pretty well made levels, fun to play.			",122,19,4,17,15,0,18

												This game is very hard but its really  fun i think people should get it. (Thats my almost 2 year old review so I'm here to re right it better!)So this game is very challenging but yes it is also very fun.I really like how you can choose old or modern sonic and then depending witch version you choose the level style is different(I also think the levels change to But i'm most likely wrong:/)I got stuck on the victor the Crocodile part (You know when you need to beat the mini game level to get the key!!) and welp i'm still stuck on it(Mostly because i stopped playing itXD)But no longer how long it's been since i played it i still find it a good game so i'm gonna leave it at  recommended!Bye.

												Sonic Genarations was released to clelebrate sonics 20th aniversay in 2011 and is regared as one of the best sonic games in years but was it any good?                  PROS- The game looks great in 60fps- The game runs on nostaliga - Simple Plt- Great Graphics - You can play as Classic Sonic Or Modern Sonic - The Stage Selection was pretty good but they dident need 3 city stages- A big step up from recent years- The game has a amazing soundtrack- There are red rings that reward the player if they find a set- There are many side activtys to do- You can view artwork and some of the great soundtrakcs Sega has made- THE UNLEASED PROJECT- Clean charecter models- Still has the boost to win formula- Mod supportCons-- The game is kinda short buy mods make up for that- The game is far too easy- They reused the death egg robot again- More classic levels like metal harbor, aptos and more- Alot of the more fun levels where put into the 3DS version- The game has been 50$ for almost 3 years!-ConslusionThis game is great and celebrates Sonics 20th aneversary greatly its fun fast paced and is fun to come back to every now and again. But serosoy why is this game still 50$? You can pick up a new copy in town for like 20$Posted 20 August.			",99,10,3,15,8,1,2

												Everything a Sonic game is supposed to be with none of the drudgery. A great return to the classic, with even the modern Sonic levels having tightened controls and better gameplay.If you want to buy a Sonic game to play in HD, this is that game.The only downside is the strange launcher and the confusingly high system requirements. Also, if you try it on a PC that doesn't meet the requirements it doesn't just not-work, time goes slow and glitchy some of the time, confusing your senses. To this day I never really know if any PC I play it on is full speed.			",155,30,3,16,12,2,23

												It's a port of the Xbox version of the game. If you have a controller you can use to play the game and got a good enough PC, you're in for a good time.The game itself, as stated by the word ""Generations"" is a throwback to the previous installments, in this case, in the form of levels both in the ""Modern"" and ""Classic"" (More like Sonic 2 but with an OP spin dash) format. The levels aren't exactly ports, but they do channel some of the original elements of the source material, if and when they can... Except for the Sonic '06 level. Thankfully they went full-on original with the design.The reason i reccomend the use of a controller is because the config tool refuses to allow shift as an input, so you can't really bind anything to it. It's a common key to use for Sonic games, so i figured it'd be important to note.It's good, under certain circumstances. It's even got a modding community, which would be fantastic if people weren't trying to port their OCs into the game all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time.BUT THAT'S THE SONIC COMMUNITY FOR YA.			",111,12,0,15,5,0,2

												This is by far the best Sonic game I have played in a long time.  The graphics are amazing.  The nostalgia from the remixes all my favorite songs is great (Chemical plant zone, and City escape).  The game is short if you ignore all the extras though.  All of the bosses except the last one are top notch.  The death Egg Robot fight was good nostalgias, Shadow was fun (they put the space battle in) and the Silver Boss fight is no use.  The last one isn't bad or not fun, I just didn't like it as much as the others.  Maybe it's just because I've never been good at Super Sonic Sections.  The only 2 levels that gave me trouble were the last one and crysis city.  The last level is just too long for my taste.  This is really a problem in some of the bonus missions.  And crysis city must have been infused with the power of Sonic 06.  That level is very faithful to source material.  I got stuck on platforms, got many gameovers, had trouble locking onto enemies, had some slow down, and even got stuck on a loop once.  You can tell they really put a lot of effort into recreating crysis city.  Overall,  I would say buy this game.  Amazing music, good throwbacks to source material, plenty of nostalgia, and overall solid gameplay make this a must own for any sonic fan.  I would say you have to be good at video games to enjoy this as if you are not you will constantly run into stuff.  8.5/10.			",184,16,7,14,22,3,29

												Sonic Generations is probably the best Sonic Game I've played since Sonic Rush or Adventure 2. (Not counting All Stars Racing Transformed. ) If you enjoyed the original 2D sonic games, then you'll find something here. If you enjoyed the 3D games, you'll find something here.It's a great mix of the old and new. Every level is nostalgic, yet they still have hints of new things and shortcuts, etc. The boss battles are entertaining, aside from the lackluster final boss. There's alot of extra content such as ghost races and other trials to compete in, and you can unlock a fair amount of stuff, including Sonic 1 for the Genesis. My only real complaint is that the Sonic Colors stage sucks no matter what Sonic you play as (Classic or Modern) and Crisis City from Sonic 06 is pretty much as bad as it was in 06. I'd definitely pick this up if  you enjoyed any previous Sonic games.I'd give this a  FAST/10.			",400,73,9,40,21,3,40

												Few characters can say they've had as many ups and downs as Sonic the Hedgehog. For better or for worse, the Sonic franchise has carved out a long timeline with a lot of changes over the years. Generations is a look at both the old and the new.Sonic Generations is split into Classic and Modern levels, Classic as the 2D Genesis-era sidescroller era and Modern as the 2D/3D platforming speedways. Classic levels play pretty much how one would expect. The physics and momentum aren't quite as tight as the old Genesis games, but they're quite good, and it's a blessing to have the Spindash keyed to one button.Modern levels are a bit more mixed. On one hand, it's clear that this is the evolution of what we saw in Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors: a crazy blitz through lush environments, relying on reflexes and intuition to keep the flow from action to action. While it's an absolute joy to punch through a successful speedrun, it's easy to break out of the flow, and find yourself wrestling awkwardly to get yourself back to speed. Seems that you're either super fast or awkwardly trying to speed back up. Old 3D Sonic problems rear their head, sometimes awkward turning and immediate stops and the like. Que sera.Nostalgia runs rampant. Fans of the series will be really pleased with the details. Sonic Heroes era Badniks still do the little detection jump before they attack, the snowboard from City Escape returns, the stages use the classic camera angles for the stage openers. I found myself smiling at the little things. Props to the composers for a fantastic OST.The game is a bit short. 9 levels with a Classic and modern version, some old favorite boss battles and padded challenges round the game out, but I can't help but want much more.Generations is quite flawed, but the sheer spectacle of the speed and adrenaline can't be beat. It's fun.			",214,23,0,22,10,2,9

He was a real trooper for letting me do that, despite the fact that he was surprised that I really liked the song and sang it for that long.But for my real review, here are the reasons why I think you should buy this game:-Great soundtrack-Amazing level design between classic Sonic and 3D Sonic. -Beautiful atmospheres-Cool bosses-Extra challenges that provide for more content in the game-You can mod the gameI think those are reasons enough, but don't take my word for it. Go look up videos and check it out yourself before buying. Enjoy it!			",189,34,0,31,29,1,20

												Having only played classic games until buying the game, Generations is my first Modern Sonic game, and the twenty plus years in contrast between the Genesis games really showed.While modern Sonic stages were very fun, classic stages were odd. Though they played like old Sonic games, they didn't feel like old Sonic games. In short, the games expects you to use the physics instead of letting you do things your way. For example, I had a habit in older games to quickly halt myself while in a loop so I could backtrack. In this game, if you hit the brakes and try to turn around, Sonic will glitch through the loop and you'll lose a life. It's hard to express, but I hope you see my point.But the game was still fun. The music was really good, and nothing beats listening to awesome songs, old and new, while dashing through stages.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

May be mediocre by normal standards.-Visuals are both pretty and nostalgic-Music has a bunch of remixes/rehashes of old songs (many of the songs werent even good to begin with)-Voice acting is terrible as usual-Settings and controller support arent great, kinda porty-Gameplay is OK but has typical Sonic stuff that stops gameplay unless you have the level memorized.  And of course there is a bunch of pointless animation where you aren't actually playing.  There's also a ton of random mechanics in levels that can be both unintuitive and frustrating.  The classic version of Sonic isnt captured perfectly but it's still fun enough (I guess I could say that about the new Sonic as well).-There's challenges that are, for the most part, not fun.-There's skills you can buy/equip which are kinda fun I guess.I only recommend this game if you already like Sonic.PS:In my opinion the pinball dlc is better realized than the whole game.  It's legitimately decent.			",358,54,13,41,32,6,32

												Having only played classic games until buying the game, Generations is my first Modern Sonic game, and the twenty plus years in contrast between the Genesis games really showed.While modern Sonic stages were very fun, classic stages were odd. Though they played like old Sonic games, they didn't feel like old Sonic games. In short, the games expects you to use the physics instead of letting you do things your way. For example, I had a habit in older games to quickly halt myself while in a loop so I could backtrack. In this game, if you hit the brakes and try to turn around, Sonic will glitch through the loop and you'll lose a life. It's hard to express, but I hope you see my point.But the game was still fun. The music was really good, and nothing beats listening to awesome songs, old and new, while dashing through stages.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic has had a terrible modern age compared to other series, (tarnished with sonic 06, sonic colours was awesome tho.) Sonic generations is great fun with a dedicated mod community that makes this game 10x more fun. This game is SEGA making up for past mistakes and it shows. the game is also addictive as u try to perfect your completion time throughout all the nostalgic levels. The voice acting is still cringe worthy but its a small price to pay for speedy levels, cool catchy soundtrack and well desighned levels.			",189,12,1,8,1,0,0

												My friend listened to me sing City Escape for about an hour straight. He was a real trooper for letting me do that, despite the fact that he was surprised that I really liked the song and sang it for that long.But for my real review, here are the reasons why I think you should buy this game:-Great soundtrack-Amazing level design between classic Sonic and 3D Sonic. -Beautiful atmospheres-Cool bosses-Extra challenges that provide for more content in the game-You can mod the gameI think those are reasons enough, but don't take my word for it. Go look up videos and check it out yourself before buying. Enjoy it!			",189,34,0,31,29,1,20

												This is most likely one of Sonic's best adventures in a very long time. Never have I played a modern Sonic game that was just so much fun. Sure one can debate that its not very original or the story isn't the best but really that takes nothing away from the experience. Even though the game is lacking in originality, it makes it up with amazing level design and new twists to old ideas that we're previously done. Highly recommened this!			",52,2,0,0,2,2,0

												What a great and fun game. There's so much fun to be had in this jam packed game.First of all this game is more like a HD re-release of the previous Sonic games with so many oldshool levels. The thing that this game has tat separates itself from the other god awful games is that you can play each main level with the old sonic where it's more like a 2D sidescroller and there is the modern Sonic where it's more like the modern games hence the name ""modern"" Sonic. I personally prefer oldschool Sonic because old is gold and it's way more challenging and fun.You cant go wrong with this game, Sonic fan or not, it's just plain fun and everyone can enjoy this game.

												It's one of the better modern sonic games for sure. but it still has it's issues.I love the classic sonic stuff, but the modern I could do without. Even that being said, the physics, specifically the gravity on sonic's jumps is way off from the classic games and takes some getting used to.they really milk the content on this one. there will be a stage with modern and classic variations, but there are more challege stages for them than anything else. You'll get 2 or 3 stages after you beat each hard AF boss; it really kills the momentum of unlocking new stages. because, well, there aren't that many.so what content there is, is good. but there's not a lot of it. if you're cool with all of that, and you're a (classic especially) fan, go for it.

												Awesome game! And a great trip down memory lane! Plus, I  having this game on steam really makes life easier, knowing how far past Gen the console versions are. This is probualy one of the best Sonic games ever (right next to Adventure 2) and I really recommend it! (Unless if you're new to the franchise, then don't start with this one). Although, you're gonna at least want to have some kind of controler, because the keyboard controls can be really confusing and a pain. But either way, love this game! It's awesome!

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												Incredible sense of speed and velocity, Sonic Generations is everything Unleashed hoped to be.Where Sonic games tend to punish you for being ""Too Fast"", Generation rewards you more the faster you go, but it's up to you wether you're quick enough to react.The goal stays the same as ever; Stay on the highest possible ground. You usually get 2-3 levels in any given stage. The lower you go, the slower you're forced to run, jumping death gaps and platforming narrow platforms, whereas if you stay high up and react quick enough to not fall down, your progress is significntly faster.Great Sonic game, and would recommend to anyone that likes platformers.

												Game: Sonic GenerationsGenre: AdventureDeveloper: Sonic Team/SEGASystem: Steam/PCTotal Score: 96/100Value Score: 9.6/10• Story: 9/10o Sonic the Hedgehog was having a birthday party with all the friends he has made in over the past couple of years. However something off in the distance a dark ominous being appeared and sucked everyone up and leaving both Sonic and Tails confused at what happened in a unknown mysterious space void. There they find themselves in a familiar location and as they traveled around they managed to find younger form of themselves. Now both Sonics and Tails will be going on a new journey to save their friends and their own respected times and worlds.• Characters: 10/10o Almost every single Sonic series hero and villain appear in this game. There are some ones who do not make an appearance but all of the major characters from the past few generations do appear. You have characters like Sonic and Tails from both the past and present, Dr. Eggman of the past and present, Amy, Shadow the hedgehog, Rouge, Knuckles and the rest from Colors, Unleashed and etc. The enemies are also the same depending on the level of which game it reflects off from. Some of the notable bosses as well from the past games also make an appearance. Sonic Generations is pretty much like a reunion for the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.• GamePlay: 9/10o Sonic Generations plays differently from the older Sonic games. For one thing levels and stages are divided into different areas from past Sonic games and you can access them through as Classic Sonic or Modern sonic in a world map like sidescroller style. Playing as either sonic will alter the gameplay and changes the whole design of a level/stage. Classic Sonic's gameplay style is more old school 2D view while Modern Sonic's is mostly 3D view like recent Sonic games. There are three levels with each area having a mini boss and a boss at the end of the three levels. Defeating each mini boss and boss earns you a chaos emerald which is used to fight the last boss at the end of the game. Each level consists stages from different eras of Sonic - in the PC version which is the same as the home console versions, the levels and stages are included as : Classic Era - Green Hill from Sonic the Hedgehog, Chemical Plant from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sky Sanctuary from Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles. The Dreamcast era includes Speed highway from Sonic Adventure 1, City Escape from Sonic Adventure 2 and Seaside hill from Sonic Heroes. The Modern era which is the last era has Crisis City from Sonic the Hedgehog 2006, Rooftop Run from Sonic Unleashed and Planet Wisp from Sonic Colors. The usual gameplay rules apply to both modern and classic sonic - collecting rings and racing your way towards the exit marker at the end of the stage after avoiding all sorts of enemies and obstacles. For Modern sonic you can super speed dash upon a limitation bar which can be increased by collecting rings while classic sonic mainly plays like the old Sonic games with little to no difference. The level designs for each type is completely different even though it may be in the same stage. You have the usual power ups such as invincibility, shields which range from the regular green shield, the electric shield which absorbs rings, the fire ring which can make Sonic shoot like a fireball and the water shield which Sonic can use to breathe underwater or to have a extra bounce. Upon completing stages you will get access to additional missions which base around the level of where these missions are located (which is above each level entrance). These missions also vary depending on which Sonic you play as and will have a different requirement or goal as well which can range from completing a level, fighting/competing with a rival, collecting certain number of rings or simply surviving amongst other things. Completing these missions will earn you a point towards the achievement of completing all the missions and allows you to unlock a artwork or a music track which can be used optionally on other stages. Red stars also make an appearance in which goes towards your achievement scoring and is counted towards the completion of the game. A new feature introduced to the Generations game is the ability to buy power ups or abilities which can be equipped upon purchase with a limitation on how many you can equip by the number of points it requires compared to how many you have in total. Abilities and power ups range from simple power ups depending on certain situations happening automatically, the inclusion of new speed abilities or the ability to protect yourself with some bonuses such as keeping a few rings even after taking a hit instead of losing all your rings. There's also a special room where you can go and check on character profiles, listen to the game's OST or to even look at some promotional artwork designed for the game. The online feature of the game introduces you to a competitive circuit where you are forced to do a level and are ranked by the time and score upon completion which then gets displayed in a leader boards for bragging rights.• Graphics: 10/10o Sonic Generations use a new style of visual design and fluidity for its cutscenes however the in gameplay seems to be similar to what you would expect see in a HD version of Sonic Colors and of Sonic the Hedgehog 4. The new cutscenes seem reminiscent of a typical western influenced platformer which isnt a bad thing. The visual designs for the characters look great especially on the older versions of characters. The environments re-done from past Sonic games look incredible with the new style and brings a whole new depth to whatever the player had imagined beforehand in the past games. There are some slow down and FPS drops but that is only because you would need a stronger CPU than what is recommended but by not that much and not very noticeable.• Sound: 10/10o Sonic Generations have managed to keep majority of the voice overs for their characters from all eras including the eras without voice overs are nicely done and you can tell the difference in the quality/type of voice. However even though Sonic doesnt talk might be a bad thing - what was worse is the fact that Shadow and Rouge's voice actors were changed but it isnt bad to the extent where they sound completely off. The sound effects which were made famous in the older sonic games and all of the other games make a complete return.• Music: 10/10o Sonic Generations consists of a mixture of old classic tracks, original tracks from modern games and remixes of all of the songs with a bit of new tracks exclusive to the game. The remixes are actually quite well made and some of them are even BETTER than the originals. Another nice thing that they added is the ability to change the music when you play in a stage. Simply upon clicking to start on a stage change the music to whatever you have unlocked via playing missions.• Length: 9/10o Sonic Generations although might seem a bit short but it takes a lot of time and dedication to get all the red stars, perfect score points upon completion and to get every single music/artwork unlocked. At the most you will complete at least 12-15 hours on a straight way playthrough with minimal missions completed. For a platformer that is a pretty decent amount since most platformers are usually done within 7-10 hours.• Replay Value: 10/10o Sonic Generations most powerful aspect is possibly its replay value aspect. With the ability to play in over 50 different stages over the choice of 7+ maps that seems to be a pretty hefty amount considering if you add the mini bosses and the bosses you fight along the way along with some of the things you need to collect such as Red stars which will eventually make you play through the levels multiple times.

												Welcome to the Next Generation!Sonic Generations brings back the core of Sonic along with the new mechanics that Sonic Series needed, since the downfall of ""Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)"", the series took a major downfall and refused to focus on what the it was all about. Sonic Generations brings back that part and should be considered the franchise's future. However, not sure where and when Sega will continue to use this engine to bring back more classic gameplay perhaps even remake Sonic 1-3 with this engine would suffice in bringing back more Modders to take a challenge.If you have not thought about playing the Classics, and atleast going through time to all the Games that really were a hit aside from the last three levels, you just might enjoy this game. Although, the last 3 sets died to me in the original useage, they really made it fun in this version so the Levels are a bonus.DLC? Not interested, but, hey! Check out the Unleashed Project which is completely free, and replaces all the levels in the game with the levels from Sonic Unleashed! Go get it...The game overall is a 9/10, a few things could be removed, and others added...One last thing, I should Thank a Special Friend who gifted this game. So, Thank You very much (You know who you are).			",65,2,1,0,1,0,0

												Incredible sense of speed and velocity, Sonic Generations is everything Unleashed hoped to be.Where Sonic games tend to punish you for being ""Too Fast"", Generation rewards you more the faster you go, but it's up to you wether you're quick enough to react.The goal stays the same as ever; Stay on the highest possible ground. You usually get 2-3 levels in any given stage. The lower you go, the slower you're forced to run, jumping death gaps and platforming narrow platforms, whereas if you stay high up and react quick enough to not fall down, your progress is significntly faster.Great Sonic game, and would recommend to anyone that likes platformers.

The 2D levels are lovely like the very old sonic games, but the 3D levels are feeling a bit..too fast. You just rush threw through them with not enough gameplay by yourself. Well,looks cool,still..

												2D Sonic done right.3D Sonic done right.Amazing reiterations of Sonic music in an orchestrial tone.Story is dumb, but you can skip it all.Boss fights are lacking, but still kinda fun.Challenges to keep you busy.Graphics done extremely well.All the levels are rehashed directly from old Sonic games in 2D and 3D. The level design is spot on.Sega finally make a fantastic game that left me wanting more! It's a shame that there is exclusive content on the 3DS version, because I really want to play more retro levels in the style that is Sonic Generations.If you like Sonic, you'll love Generations.

												Sonic Generations. A title that is really good, and has a lot of replay value, but it really... understates its welcome? It has a (slightly) diverse range of remade levels from past games, and both Sonics control beautifully, but it's pretty damn short, and $50 is honestly just overpriced. But when I say replay value, I MEAN IT. It has lots of stuff to collect, including concept art for Sonic games from the past, and even MUSIC from Sonic games from the past! The levels always leave something new for every playthrough, first or not, and keep you playing over and over again. The remixes used for levels are downright AWESOME, and the bosses provide a fair challenge while not being too overly frustrating- very rarely do I ever rage-quit because of a boss. Overall, it makes its place well in the Sonic franchise, and it's an amazing 20th anniversary title. However, the story is so simplistic that it's almost bland, and it just screams missed opportunities. But it does have, yep, a modding community! You can download and play a diverse range of mods that can have new stages, characters, bosses... anything, really! Overall, it's a good game, but a bit overpriced. I recommend it to Sonic fans old and new. Heck, even if you're not a fan of Sonic, just give this game a go. You might end up loving it!			",10,1,2,1,2,0,0

												A wonderful blend of Classic and Modern Sonic, combining and utilizing the mechanics of both while traveling through 9 zones based on Sonic titles, as well as 90 challenge maps based on those levels, plus four boss fights.Pros and Cons+Amazing music+Gorgeous visuals in motion+Great variety in level themes+Fantastic gameplay if you can get into it, but Sonic goes VERY FAST-Stability issues in win 10-Learning curve can be more frustrating to new players than you'd expect-No levels from Sonic 3 or Sonic CD, boo!-And then Sonic is hurled off a cliffThis game is essentially a road-map to effectively pursuing user nostalgia. Playing Modern Sonic in Classic Sonic levels rendered in HD makes you wistful for what could be, and vice versa.			",695,205,18,95,57,6,122

												Sonic Generations is definately one of the best Sonic games since Sonic Adventure 2! Its a mix of the old games (Sonic the Hedgehog) with the new ones (Unleashed), and has a great value not only for the Sonic lovers, but specially for nostaligic gamers. Most of the levels played with the ""old"" sonic will imediatelly be identified by those who used to played Mega Drive's Sonic games! The graphics are beautiful, and the musics, like the rest of the game, its a mix of old (but eternal) tunes but also new ones! The only negative point in this game is its really weak graphic optimization. You better have a really good computer, or your game will run full of crashes and low frame-rates.Anyway, it's a really good game, really worth the price!			",329,68,23,39,22,5,40

												Best Sonic game i've ever played, it reminds me of the old Sonic game i used to play with my friends *memories :((*The graphics are great compare to the older Sonic games, characters look better and nicer :))Play as the classic Sonic with the old gameplay, brought me back the old fun way of playing Sonic. But as the modern Sonic, it was the best experience playing free-run Sonic game for me, the camera changes all the time with buttons appear at the screen, test your reflect skill to the limit :))However, the buttons of the game isn't the keyboard, still the button of a console hand, maybe this game isn't 100% optimized for PC (doesn't bother me at all)=> Gameplay still great.The game has the ""Online Mode"" but still haven't tried it yet, 'cause i buy the game just to enjoy the singleplayer with Sonic and his friend.Will be playing this game more often, if you are a Sonic fan or have an interest of Sonic, i suggest you should buy this game, recommended			",265,69,29,23,19,6,37

												==WARNING==Before I start, I played through this game fully, I have completed around 2/3's of the side missions, and I have not gotten a lot of the red rings. I also used a XBOX 360 controller, so I don't know how the keyboard plays. I've played this in the past and have good knowledge about this community and past games, with that out of the way, lets get to the review!==WARNING==Good homage to all past sonic games, great music (as usual), brilliant level design, and great boss and rival battles, basically and argueably, the best sonic game since Ye ole days.I've been a big fan of sonic's games, weither it would be the OG trilogy, the Storybook saga, the wii and wii u games (colours, unleashed, lost world), and even (some) the spin-offs. and I can safely say this game can hold up to the standards of the prestigous sonic installments.The gameplay is silky smooth with eye candy graphics, Classic Sonic takes a blast to the past with ol' fashioned controls and mechanics, while Modern Sonic offers a Z-axis for all of you fancy people (me included), and new mechanics such as the lovely Boost that everyone can't keep their thumb off of your choice of key binding. Lovely gameplay just lovely.The Music is extremely well done as always so I won't dabble a lot in this part of the review, even the remixes are enjoyable! (proceeds to sing Escape From the City WOOOO).The Levels are well done complete with alternate paths, well placed traps and enemies, and those lovely red rings. yaaaaaaaay. With redesigns of popular places from the sonic universe such as the iconic Green Hill Zone, my only complaint is the devil stage that somehow came from the dreaded '06, (cringes) Crisis City, personally to me the hardest acts in the game, atleast it has good music! (everyone and their ears cheer!). Bosses are great, my favorite being Perfect Chaos. (I LOVE Sonic Adventure, except Big the Cat, why was he even created?!) Anyways, the bosses are great, but I can see why some people complain about them being too easy, The rival battles are one of the most enjoyable parts about this game, especially the battle with Shadow, LIVE AND LEARN. To sum it up Level design is pretty good.The cutscenes are also well done, seeing both Sonics and the Eggmans interacting was both humorous and enjoyable. ( I need a loop of Classic Sonic trying to do the homing attack, don't ask why).Heres a quick check listPros- levels are good and well thought out (Bosses and Rivals included)- gameplay is silky smooth- Music is amazing as always- graphics are eye candy, along with memorable and vibrant enviornments- oh and a great modding community- Get this, Side missions (Especially Modern Sonic's) ARE ACTUALLY FUN THIS TIME AROUND!- the Collectibles are well-worth getting if you love sonic music.Cons- I can see why people don't like the bosses- Crisis City- (for me) the red rings, but they're optional- Classic Sonic is over-SHADOWed by Modern Sonic In my opinionI'm not giving a numeric rating so I'm ending with thisI really enjoyed this game! \m/(>.<)\m/ Rock on, or should I say, Run on!

												A time paradox many people love.  I can simply summarize this game as a vision of nostalgia reflecting on where Sonic came from and how far Sonic has come.What I think is awesome is the ability to play through stages that are reminiscent of the games of yester-year as Modern Sonic, yet being able to play through the games of today as Classic Sonic.  Really nice experience.   However, the final battle is truly lacking....Downsides?  I've experienced slowdown during cutscenes which ruins the voice synchronization of Sonic and Tails.  There are also some moments during the game where the controls will be unresponsive during a few critical moments.  Pits Ahoy!!!!This made me remember how good Sonic used to be.  Very nice experience.			",262,77,12,21,24,7,23

												Overall, Sonic Generations is gud enough for yer all sanic player who likes both the oldschool sanic games and the modern one. This gaem has a nostalgic feelz in it, because you'll play through remake of old stage from sanic's games. Some of the bgm are remixes, but you can change it once you get the music through challenge stage (not all bgm included). So, this game is worth to buyPROS+2fast4u+It's Sanic+2 playable character (Sonic and Sonic)+Classic and modern stage+Both 2D and 3D level+Remixes BGM+Collectible and achievement farming included+Classic story+The stage are beautifully created+Working good with wooden pc like mine (Even though you must tweaked a bit)+Epic boss fight+You can change the bgm used in stage/boss fight+Beautifully rendered cutscene+It's not sanic boomCONS-The stage are recycled from the old games, so no new stages-Remixes BGM-Classic Story-Only 2 character playable from all the cast available-NO BIG ARMS THEME (Y u do dis Sega)9/11 2fast4uSanic is a lot faster than my pc loading speed or my internet download speed ",20,2,0,7,3,0,4

												As a first time Sonic player I didn't expect a whole lot coming into this game, and I was really, really pleased. It's fast, it's fun. Every level is awesome (except for one, but it's still mostly good), with cool visuals, cool music, cool friggin' gameplay. It's 100% video game. The quality takes a nosedive with the final boss, but honestly the rest of the game is brilliant enough that I can excuse that. An excellent video game!			",169,35,3,7,7,0,15

												TL;DR:  If you already like Sonic games, this is an easy recommendation.  If you're new to the series or not well-informed, this is a great way to see what you've been missing.  I've had this one for a little while.  Since I accidentally deleted my save when I screwed up my graphics settings, I decided to give this game another go-through.  Once again I'll mention the Sonic bundle on Steam.Sonic Generations is both a new game and an anthology of sorts.  It's Sonic's birthday (and this was Sonic's 20th anniversary as of the year it was released), and this mysterious Time Eater thing kidnaps everyone and takes them to this white void where time stands still...and where familiar locales are also present.  And it is in this white space where Sonic meets his past self.  What is the Time Eater, and why has it stolen all of these Zones away?  Gameplay in Sonic Generations is split between two characters, Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic.  Classic Sonic plays much like he does in the Genesis games.  He doesn't have the Homing Attack, but he can Spindash, and most of his gameplay is focused on sidescrolling platforming.  His stages are ""2½D"" in that even though the course can turn and bend, he still really only follows two planes.  This is most evident in some parts of Sky Sanctuary.  Modern Sonic plays like a cross between the day stages of Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors.  He lacks the Spindash but he has a Boost Meter powered by rings and defeated enemies for a nigh-invulnerable surge of speed, his Homing Attack returns, he grinds on rails, he can quickly move to the side or drift for a hard turn, he does tricks off of ramps for more Boost, and he has some 2D sections too, though there are a few 3D platforming sections.  Both characters need to get to the end of their respective Acts to clear the Zones.  The game is split into three sections representing three eras of Sonic:  Classic, Dreamcast, and Modern, and each section has three Zones and are guarded by a boss that comes from that era.  Every Zone has two Acts, one for each Sonic.  Just clearing the Acts isn't enough to progress to the boss however--clearing all six Acts for the era unlocks Challenge Gates for every Zone in that era.  To get the three keys to unlock the boss door, every Zone in that era needs to have just one Challenge Gate cleared (and you need to physically go get the key from the hub world too).  It doesn't matter which Sonic completes which Gate, so long as each Zone has one clear to its name.  And this isn't even enough to open the final area.  The Chaos Emeralds are once again given to you through gameplay, though they're mostly given for boss battles.  And in each era, there are Rival Battles where Sonic faces off with an era-relevant hedgehog.Even though this is a ""greatest hits"" of sorts for Sonic, the returning Zones aren't copy-and-pasted rehashes of old locales, and they're more like remixes with plenty of callbacks to old features, even if they aren't represented as Zones in this game.  Green Hill Act 1 has the corkscrews from Emerald Hill, the spinning top platforms from Marble Garden get a makeover for Sky Sanctuary Act 1, the street boarding section from City Escape is greatly expanded, and the Mad Convoy section in that Zone returns...with a vengeance.  The returning bosses also get amped up, so old tactics won't work as well this time around.  But this is the perfect opportunity to mention the Skill Shop, a shop set in the hub world where you can use the points for clearing Acts to buy skills to customize each Hedgehog.  While there aren't very many to start, you can unlock more by clearing challenges or beating the game.  The issue is then keeping the cost of all of the skills below 100, which can be pretty tricky since naturally the more powerful ones cost more.  And yes, Super Sonic in stages returns, but you'll have to clear the game first and it'll take up all 100 of your skill points to use.  What I LikedThere's a lot of content here, though if you want to blow through it all, you can probably go from start to finish in a few hours no problem.  If you're a completionist though, look out.  Clearing every Act and boss fight is just to get to the end of the game--can you finish every Challenge Gate?  Get all of the Red Rings scattered through both Acts of every Zone?  S-rank every Act?  S-rank every Challenge Gate?  Getting Red Rings will unlock artwork in the Collection Room to the far left of the hub world, and every cleared Challenge Gate will have a bell to ring, which releases a music note you have a short amount of time to chase down and collect which will reward you with either more artwork or music to listen to in the Collection Room.  Said Collection Room also has a section to review character profiles and rewatch the movies from the game if you want.  I can safely say when I do a review of a Sonic game, I'm going to mention the music.  This game is no exception, and I really liked how both Sonics had a variation of the same theme for each Zone, much like how the music for most Sonic games starting with Sonic 3 did.  Better yet, all of the music you collect through the Challenge Gates and Red Rings can be used for the music for whatever Act or boss fight before you begin.  If you want to fight the final boss to Green Hill Zone, you're free to!  You'll just need to unlock them first.  The hub world also has its own spin on the Zone or boss music when you're near the entrance, so that's a nice touch.  There is a level of polish here I could appreciate.  Consider you free one of Sonic's friends for completing a Zone's two Acts.  The comments they each say differ depending on which Sonic was the second one, though most comment about Classic Sonic looking different than the one they're used to.  One of the movies is also different depending on which Sonic you're using, though unfortunately there's no way to view the ""other side"" version of it or hear the other friend responses without starting a new game and erasing your old save (or you can back it up first, naturally).  What I Didn't LikeGetting hit in this game is an exercise in frustration.  Both Sonics tend to do the ""dazed for a second"" thing that started in Sonic Heroes, though there's a skill to negate that.  The big issue I had was that the rings are especially difficult to grab once they've flown out.  Classic Sonic is stuck to the 2D plane but it seems like the rings aren't, and a few times it seems like Modern Sonic's rings were just fake trying to pick them back up.  There aren't any shields in this game (except as skills for Classic Sonic), and while you only drop a portion of your rings when hit if you have enough, just trying to retain those last few can make survival a bit of a challenge.  I honestly didn't like how there was so little mention of the handheld titles apart from a small handful of songs from the Gameboy Advance and Playstation Portable games.  This is more of a personal issue, but I grew up with a Game Gear and never owned a Sega home console, and it's a little disappointing how all of those games just got glossed over.  For as popular as Sunset Park Act 3's unique theme is, even it didn't get a remix here.  Sad.  My rig chugged at a few times, but that's not something I can really hold against the game.  It doesn't scream ""bad port"" like some games, but if you're looking to buy this, make absolutely sure you have a good enough machine.In Closing...This will be a nostalgia trip for many.  For those like me where it isn't, there's still a lot of fun and enjoyment to be had here.  Can't complain about the controls, and while a game clear won't take very long, 100%ing this game will keep you busy for a while.  Casino Nights DLCYou can probably skip this unless you really have a hankering for hedgehog-themed pinball.			",519,139,12,130,27,8,81

												This game was amazing! Although the last boss was a pain, it was still fun and i enjoy the side challenges for Both Sonics. The only problem with this game is the fact that Seaside hill can be annoying, but other than that, it was a master piece.			",60,5,0,6,3,2,2

												It's an enjoyable game with some frustrating mechanics and really, really, really cheesy CGI movies (like pretty much all Sonic games). The graphics are sharp, detailed and colorful, the sounds are nice and the voice overs are terrible. The gameplay itself is pretty fun, especially when playing as Young Sonic. The Old Sonic sequences reminded me of Sonic Adventure. They're, most of the times, fast and there are some cool chasing scenes in them as well. The bossfights, well, they're frustrating, especially the ones where you have to beat a rival. The last 2 bossfights can also be really frustrating. But there's fun to had as well of course. You just have to ignore some of the poorer mechanics.All in all, it's a good game, just don't play it for hours and hours and you'll be fine.[Rating: 73/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												It's an okay game to be honest, has very very good controls for classic sonic, but sometimes modern sonic just doesnt feel right, or doesn't control how you want him to. the game is incredibly short (4 hours it took me to beat the main story, which is unacceptable). its good to play in short bursts, but yeah. the soundtrack is pretty awesome. Also, why the hell is crisis city in this game?! Time got rewritten in sonic 06 so it shouldnt exist >.<  ergh, anyways, its a hit or miss game, so just be warned			",294,57,10,35,28,3,56

												In just a few words, this game is amazing and worth a buy!Why?Well, first of all it is the first ""Unleashed Sonic"" game for the PC and that alone made me buy this game.Oh and do you remember the Classic Sonic? The one from the Mega Drive/ Genesis games? Yeah, he's here too!This game is basically a ""Time Travel"" type of game, because the modern and the classic Sonic meet and go through some old Stages (from previous Sonic Games) and each Sonic has it own style of gameplay!Classic Sonic plays like the old Sonic games, and that's awesome because there were a LOT of people complaining because the new Sonic games did not look like the originals.Modern Sonic plays like Sonic in ""Sonic Unleashed"" and ""Sonic Colors"", and I think that I don't need to say anything more.Technically, this game is amazing, it runs at Full 60 Fps, so it's smooth as butter, and that's always nice... right? Yeah, it is!Graphically, this game is gorgeus, Sonic Team did an amazing job turning 2D Classic Stages into fully 3D Stages with jaw dropping environments!And I must not forget the Soundtrack, OH GOD! THE SOUNDTRACK! Once again they did an amazing job recreating songs from past games for this game! I can listen to the Classic City Escape song all day long!Now for the bad part. For me the game was too easy and I could beat it in less of a day, but there's an HUGE dificulty spike (at least for me) between Rooftop Run and Planet Wisp. Planet Wisp was a pain in the butt for me (both Classic and Modern)!There's also a ... bug? Yeah, let's call it bug. There's also a bug in the Ranking mode, that I experienced both on console and in my computer. Whenever you play a stage, the game will not save your time in the leaderboards. Although this is not a HUGE thing for me, it's something that I think they should fix.But Overall, I think this game is worth a buy, even if you have the console version of this game!Even though I have the Ps3 version, I bought the Pc version, because it plays at Full 60Fps, it's compatible with many resolutions and we must not forget the giant and great Modding Comunity for this game (and specially the Unleashed Project, that allows you to play all of Sonic's Unleashed Day Stages in Sonic Generations).Final Veridict:Buy it now!

												Sonic Generations is the one of the Games that just cannot Compare but when It try to the Old Sonic Games, somehow I'm perhaps pleased. It compares. Quite like a video game that I would recommend, Sonic ""Generations"" is My favourite entrance into the series of the Hedgehog runner. Doctor ""Egghead"" Robot Nick, is still the evil of being villain Killing sonic ""The"" Hedgehog, but this time it's also time and Sonic has two Sonics and the levels that are played in the game are better because they have already created by the developers of the game before in another time. I rate ""Sonic"" Generations a well-done 8.3 out of all of the 10 marks plausible.			",129,50,3,7,13,3,13

												This is gonna be hard since I wish I could actually say more than a simple recommendation advice. So for those of you who don't know if they should grab this game on a Steam Sale: Go for it. Despite one or two bugs (Camera/targeting issue) it's worth the cash for those who liked Sonic and think that ever since the Dreamcast saga everything they came out with was crap. Now long version made in topics, cause lazy.- Some great Pieces of Soundtrack- Good level design (not perfect though)- SPEED IS THE GAME and they made it shine again in this title - Ok Story - Some Voice acting sounded weird  and some lip syncing issues- BADASS EGGMAN ROBOTS/Creations, COOLEST EVER!!!!!Just like any game it has it's high and low moments, but overall this Sonic game does not disappoint and delivers you that experience from when your were a little boy playing while eating ice cream.

												Since Sonic Adventure on the dreamcast I haven't enjoyed a single Sonic game thats been released, until now...This is a true fan service game featuring remastered versions of some of the best levels from the entire series while playing as 2 different versions of Sonic.Each level lets you play as either classic or modern Sonic, classic plays as a side scroller while modern plays like Sonic unleashed (without the silly werehog sections). The game runs at an eye watering pace (especially modern Sonic) and theres multiple routes and secret tokens hidden throughout each stage, getting them all will take some time.Aside from the main story, which should take the average player 6+ hours to complete, theres over 100 challenges to complete too. Beating these challenges unlocks bonus content such as character models, classic music and artwork.If your a fan of the Sonic series then this is a must buy, its simply the best Sonic game in years by far.

												This game. This freaking game. This game is now the quintessential Sonic game. The levels are fun, the music is awesome, and the game is challenging enough and has enough content to keep players coming back for more. I only have a few bad things to say about it. First, the cutscenes often lag for me (it might just be my computer though). Second, Crisis City exists and is harder than I expected (that other sonic game we don't talk about got erased from the timeline! How is there a level from it?). Third, while the design and music for the final boss is awesome, it is...disappointing. For most players it is either too hard or too easy. Overall, despite a few shortcomings, any gamer who considers themselves a Sonic fan needs this game. Seriously. Buy it now.Also, Silver never once says it's no use and SHADOW DOESN'T HAVE GUNS!

												Sonic Generations is a Sonic game.Wait! Don't leave. I know that's come to mean a vastly different thing than it used to, but Sonic Generations has shown me that different no longer means bad. An interesting duality-based game, SG proves that the 3D Sonic formula can and does work and it shows you time and time again that when something works, it is beautiful.So it's kind of a shame that after finishing the first six stages, the entire thing kind of says ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and decides to become mediocre. The 2D sonic stages become horrific timesink chores and the 3D sonic stages lose a bit of their shine.(Sonic Colors stage, please go die somewhere)In addition, the boss fights range from awesome to awful and some of them are downright broken. That doesn't mean you shouldn't get the game, though. Far from it. I find Sonic Generations a great game with some awful flaws, which is a pretty good analogy for Sonic The Hedgehog in general.At $50 or $60 I would have felt cheated, but I think anything under $30 is a decent price for a Sonic game with a good amount of content, a lot of new ideas, and a whole lot of heart (it's even got some decent writing!).I award this game 8.5/10 Bumpers			",474,90,5,45,26,6,34

												It's really fun if you like platformers, ignoring that the levels are remakes of older sonic levels, it's the best modern sonic game (maybe after Colors). It's not as fast as Unleashed but it's still pretty fast and it's difficulty is a lot better balanced.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game made for the 20th anniversary of the lightning fast blue hedgehog. It's a game made for the fans, but also a good game to introduce newcomers into the Sonic universe. This game puts both Classic Sonic from the 2D and Genesis games, and Modern Sonic from post-Sonic Adventure in 3D. Each level is a level from a past game, all remastered in HD, with completely new designs for both 2D and 3D gameplay. The game controls splendidly for a Sonic game. The graphics are just amazing to look at, pleasing the eyes. The music is all remixed and given a new feel, complimenting the level perfectly. You're even to change the music with music you've unlocked by collecting special Red Rings and beating Challenge Missions. This game is extremely fun, with an equal amount of platforming and blasting through the level. Recommend this to both fans and people who want to get into the series. 8.5/10			",42,8,1,8,2,0,1

												Sonic Generations is a double-shot throwback to the classic Sonic that we knew in the cheap day-cares that attempted to make kids want to stay there, to the light-speed Dreamcast Sonic whose coolness shamed the ice caps. It's been ten years since I've played a Sonic game worth playing, and the 3DS version alone was good enough, but Sonic Generations for the PC (or a console, if you still think they're the pinnacle of gaming) gives hope that the blue blur can still be as great as his glory days. The game has stages from the classics and the times when I cried at how Sonic just wasn't the same, but all of them are fun, and you definitely have a little bit of an edge if you've played a stage on an original game that may be featured in this. On that note, the G.U.N. truck was a bit nasty back in SA2. Here, it's VICIOUS!There's a shortage of downloadable content, so far being only Casino Nights pinball, but the shortage of content is by no means a bore. Casino Nights pinball has some fun slot action from StH2 (Genesis), classic pinball feel of Sonic Spinball (Game Gear), and the... how to say... refined appeal of Casinopolis' pinball stages from Sonic Adventure (Dreamcast). Knowing what I know now of the game, I would've paid $30 to $35 for this (I'd pay more if we were given Mushroom Hill on the PC and consoles), and I'm most certainly proud to have snagged it on a $7.50 deal!

												This game has its ups and downs, to be sure.  When I first started playing, I was really enjoying myself.  The Hedgehog engine makes for beautiful scenery and the music is all incredibly well remastered.  The nostalgia-tripping was welcomed.  And then it all went to♥♥♥♥♥♥when the Sonic 2006 level came.  Granted, Sonic Unleashed had a solid level, but the 2006 and Colors levels are abysmal.  All the bosses are boring, the rival fights (save for Metal Sonic) are confusing, and the story is shoehorned.  The gameplay mechanics were fantastic in some areas but the level design throws in cheap hits just to slow you down/make you lose rings.  It's annoying, and considering Sonic is all about moving fast, it's poor level design.I don't know if Generations is Sonic's return to form, but it's definitely fun (at least, on the whole) for a good five or six hours.  And if you're a diehard fan, there's a lot more than that to keep you entertained in the challenge levels and unlockable content.			",409,93,6,31,16,3,34

												I started playing Sonic back when I had my Nintendo Gamecube a long time ago. This created a deep place and a everlasting love for the little blue guy back from a young age. When I fist played Sonic Geneartions on the PC I as confused to say the least. While the game itself looks as great as any other modern game does it the constrolls that really put me off. The game does not come with a pre set control scheme. This make mapping keys difficult especially considering that they way it goes about it is by placing an Xbox controller on your screen and makes you create keyboard alternatives for things like the A, B, X & Y buttons. This bsically just makes you realise that this game was clearly not made with the PC in mind. Despte this, if you use a controller it should work fine as long as it's an Xbox controller.In terms of the game itself asider from the bad PC controlls the game is a huge hommage to fans of Sonic as it contains all of the best, most loved Sonic maps and levels ever made. This includes both the modern and the older sonic maps.In basic terms this game is a wise investment but I'd certainly wait untl you see it on sale so you can get it cheaper. My reason for this is tht it's not that long, unless you wan't to try and get the best times for the levels then you'd spend like 30 hours on it.7/10			",65,7,0,6,9,0,9

												Sonic Generations is a double-shot throwback to the classic Sonic that we knew in the cheap day-cares that attempted to make kids want to stay there, to the light-speed Dreamcast Sonic whose coolness shamed the ice caps. It's been ten years since I've played a Sonic game worth playing, and the 3DS version alone was good enough, but Sonic Generations for the PC (or a console, if you still think they're the pinnacle of gaming) gives hope that the blue blur can still be as great as his glory days. The game has stages from the classics and the times when I cried at how Sonic just wasn't the same, but all of them are fun, and you definitely have a little bit of an edge if you've played a stage on an original game that may be featured in this. On that note, the G.U.N. truck was a bit nasty back in SA2. Here, it's VICIOUS!There's a shortage of downloadable content, so far being only Casino Nights pinball, but the shortage of content is by no means a bore. Casino Nights pinball has some fun slot action from StH2 (Genesis), classic pinball feel of Sonic Spinball (Game Gear), and the... how to say... refined appeal of Casinopolis' pinball stages from Sonic Adventure (Dreamcast). Knowing what I know now of the game, I would've paid $30 to $35 for this (I'd pay more if we were given Mushroom Hill on the PC and consoles), and I'm most certainly proud to have snagged it on a $7.50 deal!

												A game made for the 20th anniversary of the lightning fast blue hedgehog. It's a game made for the fans, but also a good game to introduce newcomers into the Sonic universe. This game puts both Classic Sonic from the 2D and Genesis games, and Modern Sonic from post-Sonic Adventure in 3D. Each level is a level from a past game, all remastered in HD, with completely new designs for both 2D and 3D gameplay. The game controls splendidly for a Sonic game. The graphics are just amazing to look at, pleasing the eyes. The music is all remixed and given a new feel, complimenting the level perfectly. You're even to change the music with music you've unlocked by collecting special Red Rings and beating Challenge Missions. This game is extremely fun, with an equal amount of platforming and blasting through the level. Recommend this to both fans and people who want to get into the series. 8.5/10			",42,8,1,8,2,0,1

												I started playing Sonic back when I had my Nintendo Gamecube a long time ago. This created a deep place and a everlasting love for the little blue guy back from a young age. When I fist played Sonic Geneartions on the PC I as confused to say the least. While the game itself looks as great as any other modern game does it the constrolls that really put me off. The game does not come with a pre set control scheme. This make mapping keys difficult especially considering that they way it goes about it is by placing an Xbox controller on your screen and makes you create keyboard alternatives for things like the A, B, X & Y buttons. This bsically just makes you realise that this game was clearly not made with the PC in mind. Despte this, if you use a controller it should work fine as long as it's an Xbox controller.In terms of the game itself asider from the bad PC controlls the game is a huge hommage to fans of Sonic as it contains all of the best, most loved Sonic maps and levels ever made. This includes both the modern and the older sonic maps.In basic terms this game is a wise investment but I'd certainly wait untl you see it on sale so you can get it cheaper. My reason for this is tht it's not that long, unless you wan't to try and get the best times for the levels then you'd spend like 30 hours on it.7/10			",65,7,0,6,9,0,9

												This game has its ups and downs, to be sure.  When I first started playing, I was really enjoying myself.  The Hedgehog engine makes for beautiful scenery and the music is all incredibly well remastered.  The nostalgia-tripping was welcomed.  And then it all went to♥♥♥♥♥♥when the Sonic 2006 level came.  Granted, Sonic Unleashed had a solid level, but the 2006 and Colors levels are abysmal.  All the bosses are boring, the rival fights (save for Metal Sonic) are confusing, and the story is shoehorned.  The gameplay mechanics were fantastic in some areas but the level design throws in cheap hits just to slow you down/make you lose rings.  It's annoying, and considering Sonic is all about moving fast, it's poor level design.I don't know if Generations is Sonic's return to form, but it's definitely fun (at least, on the whole) for a good five or six hours.  And if you're a diehard fan, there's a lot more than that to keep you entertained in the challenge levels and unlockable content.			",409,93,6,31,16,3,34

												Sonic Generations is a Sonic game.Wait! Don't leave. I know that's come to mean a vastly different thing than it used to, but Sonic Generations has shown me that different no longer means bad. An interesting duality-based game, SG proves that the 3D Sonic formula can and does work and it shows you time and time again that when something works, it is beautiful.So it's kind of a shame that after finishing the first six stages, the entire thing kind of says ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and decides to become mediocre. The 2D sonic stages become horrific timesink chores and the 3D sonic stages lose a bit of their shine.(Sonic Colors stage, please go die somewhere)In addition, the boss fights range from awesome to awful and some of them are downright broken. That doesn't mean you shouldn't get the game, though. Far from it. I find Sonic Generations a great game with some awful flaws, which is a pretty good analogy for Sonic The Hedgehog in general.At $50 or $60 I would have felt cheated, but I think anything under $30 is a decent price for a Sonic game with a good amount of content, a lot of new ideas, and a whole lot of heart (it's even got some decent writing!).I award this game 8.5/10 Bumpers			",474,90,5,45,26,6,34

That's exactly what this game did with it's story while still offering fun game mechanics.

												If the game has a fault its in 3D mode. The 3D perspective is way off at times. You think you are jumping one place end up another. Also the 3D Sonic version controls are bad, the jump and blast forward are so different than the 2D you find youself accidently jumping or missing a jump over and over.If you can get past this, its a good game.7/10			",645,197,13,97,129,8,98

												It's really fun if you like platformers, ignoring that the levels are remakes of older sonic levels, it's the best modern sonic game (maybe after Colors). It's not as fast as Unleashed but it's still pretty fast and it's difficulty is a lot better balanced.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself is fantastic, but the controller support is awful. I can play maybe 20 minutes to an hour before the 360 controller cuts out (it works just fine with every other game) and I tried multiple other fixes with no luck. It's sad that this one issue can cause the game to be so much less enjoyable than it should be.			",269,60,0,28,4,2,9

												This game is beautiful, but it's no sequel to the 2d sonic series. Like most games, the greatest amount of effort went into the first few levels. After that the level design became unbearable to play through and I really tried. The game was made with speed runs in mind, but it allows the player to equip speed enhancing items.

												By far, the best 3D Sonic game we've ever got, even if that isn't exactly an earth shattering achievement. I had a great time with this game, and it's an absolute love letter to those of us who grew up on the Genesis entries. Lots of nostalgic recreations of old stages and music. There's still some trouble with the camera and controls, but not nearly as much as previous games.			",501,122,11,54,26,6,76

												Sonic Generations is a pleasure to play, coming from a long-time Sonic fan. It serves as a 'love letter' of sorts to old-school Sonic fans. It is technically very unrated, with the Hedgehog Engine now being very versitile and with few bugs (in my experience) and quite a bit more polish since it's first appearance in Sonic Unleashed. The levels are rich with detail and personality, and none of the game feels rushed or cheapened. The story is forgettable and you WON'T find yourself invested in it in the slightest. SEGA definately put a lot of effort and affection into this title. In my oppinion, this game raises the bar again... But for how long...  :p ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing. It celebrates the highs of the Sonic franchise and acknowledges the lows. ('06). It features both Classic and Modern Sonic. Aside from the Final Boss, (and a few of Modern Sonic's missions: Vector's Rooftop Run and Charmy's Planet Wisp), every game stage, normal and mission is excellent. One of my favorite parts of this game is that they provide a whole bunch of iconic Sonic tunes for you to unlock and use as the music to the stage. The only drawback this game has is: the plot (I know) feels unfinished. They needed more cutscenes featuring character commentary on stages. (Presumably, they were cut for time.) There are nine stages: Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, Speed Highway, City Escape, Seaside Hill, Crisis City, Rooftop Run, and Planet Wisp. Each level has a Classic and Modern level, each accompanied by five missions. (You only have to do a grand total of 9, one per unique level.) There are three bosses, and three rival fights, and your typical Super Sonic final boss at the end.The format is good. But honestly, without ANY Eggman base levels, it feels like it's the first half of a game that immediately skips to the final boss. Small Nitpick to avoid a repeat of '06.My personal picks would have been:Scrap Brain Zone (1), Metropolis Zone (2), Launch Base Zone (3), and then Aquatic Base ('06) that segways into Final Egg (Adventure). After that you get the flying ship levels, Winged Fortress, Flying Battery, and Skydeck. And then you get the Final Base. I also would have liked that they included levels with scrapped ideas from classic games like Sonic 2's Winter Zone and Rock Zone and Dust Hill Zone or Sonic CD's 8th level. (more commonly known as R2 due to CD's missing level slot.)But time constraints, I suppose cut prospective ideas like that out, I guess making it a 21st anniversary game with the slogan 'He's legally an adult now.' probably wouldn't have worked.

												Incidentally enough, I bought this on an amazon sale and it so happened to be my first steam game, although I had created an empty account a few months prior. This being a Sonic game with 3D levels made relatively recently, even with the good reviews I had seen there was always that lingering concern that it would pull a Secret Rings on me- not '06 terrible (I actually haven't played that but I've heard enough)- but just not compelling, and certainly only a shadow of the original games. At times, you might find yourself wishing for a bit of that super-smooth 3 and Knuckles, as always. But Generations still delivered beyond my doubts. It's definitely the best in a long while. And the graphics are a visual feast, although sometimes even a bit overwhelming as you speed by, as the game blends 2D and 3D elements in a beautifully seamless manner. The only bad thing is the Perfect Chaos boss fight. I hate that. A lot.But yeah, it's pretty good. Easily worth 5 on a sale.			",233,85,6,40,27,3,54

												Sonic Generations Review by nikfanPLOT 6/10I liked the plot of this game... But it was really short and was not going anywhere! I really liked Classic and Modern Sonic as characters in this game and Time Eater was interesting before we saw the obvious reveal that the ""The Time Eater"" was controlled by Eggman and the Dr.""PINGAS"" Robotnik.GAMEPLAY 9.5/10I must say... This is maybe the most fun I've had with a Sonic Game. I think the control is near perfect, the level design is interesting and not ""tunnel like"". It's a saferide that will give you a lot of pleasure if you are a Classic Veteran or a Modern Veteran(I can't say this for myself... I started out with the Adventure formula... But I still get enjoyment out of Modern and Classic Sonic) But I still think(For me atleast) Modern Sonic was more enjoyable, with all the speedrunning tricks and that speed. Sega got fast with this game... GRAPHICS 9/10Graphics look really good. It looks better than Colors and is somewhere on the same level with Sonic Lost World. But it's still not as beatiful as Unleashed. But you can add Unleashed Graphics thanks to the Modding Community.MUSIC 10/10This is a soundtrack I really enjoyed. All of the tracks were enjoyable and nostalgic giving it that Anniversary feel. My favourite tracks are Sky Sanctuary(all of them), Crisis City(Act 1) and City Escape. I also really enjoy Speed Highway Act 1. That track just sounds like it should be played in a Night Club and I love it :3REPLAYABILITY 10/10When the game is pretty fun to replay and speedrun... I must say, one of the best thing about this game is the Modding Community. They work on outstanding mods and they do come out freaquently. So it's a perfect way to come back to the game and try out some awesome modifications people came up with... OVERALL SCORE: 8.5/10I really liked this game. But I wanted more from the plot...P.S: Perfect Chaos is... Awesome			",63,10,2,5,2,1,0

												Seeing as how the last Sonic game I played before this was Shadow the Hedgehog on Gamecube, this Sonic game was obviously an adjustment for me as far as game mechanics, but the changes they made to the game mechanics since StH is what made it an awesome gameplay experience for me. I love how it caters to both classic and modern Sonic fans with its two styles of gameplay. Although I prefer modern Sonic's levels, classic Sonic's levels give me a nostalgic feeling because of how similar they are to the Sega Genesis style of controlling Sonic. The modern remakes of certain levels and songs also get me nostalgic as well. And I can't forget to mention the graphics are fantastic in comparision to the Gamecube era of Sonic games. After I had beaten the storyline, the game left me with wanting more modern remakes of levels from Sonic's past. Sonic Generations is one of the best Sonic games Sega has made so far.

												I never fully understood why I've always been fascinated with Sonic the Hedgehog. The classics are fun but very frustrating at times. And since modern Sonic came out, Sega has been screwing up with making quality games. They added a few annoying characters rather than memorable ones and it seems that the voice actors/actresses and lines chosen for these characters get worse and worse with each new title. Don't get me wrong, I understand it's hard to come up with new ideas and I'm sure they'll get out of the rut sometime. But at least get decent voice acting. Please.Whether you were introduced recently or around when Sonic first came out, you will love this game. It's the perfect blend of nostalgia and modern gaming combined into one. Sidescroll run as classic Sonic and listen to the jumping and rolling sounds you know and love; then play as modern Sonic and blaze through the courses with maximum speed. Each has their own unique abilities to use. Classic Sonic rolls and spin jumps and modern Sonic dashes at high speeds and has a homing attack. The music is as classic as ever; but with a modern twist thrown in that blends in perfectly for that nostalgic but modern feeling. If you aren't getting it yet, this game is very nostalgic for most people. The stages themselves are all from past Sonic games old and new. If you were hoping for brand new stage ideas however... I'm sorry to say you will not get them in this title. The story too isn't anything new for Sonic and his friends. The only cons I have are:-Short story even with side missions-First half was nothing but a blast and the second half was all the bad game stages....still fun but irritating-Not all Sonic games were referenced (Sonic Riders and Lost Rings to my knowledge)It's too bad they didn't add more memorable levels from the games like the jungle and my personal favorite with the proper introduction to Shadow the Hedgehog (Sonic Adventure 2 where it shows Maria and you start by grinding down a bridge with awesome guitar music). As much as I wish it had more, it was worth the money. I paid $7 and I would say wait for a sale of at least $15 for this game. I'd say it's worth about that. Great game! ",161,10,5,12,4,0,5

												While it doesnt have the feel the first three games had, I enjoyed my short time with this game. Both the 2s and 3d acts were enjoyable and in some cases I even enjoyed the 3d acts more than their 2d counterparts. This game does have some issues, glitches and bugs tend to pop their head out frequently and often when it causes the most damage to your run through.			",235,14,5,31,16,0,44

												UGH!!!!I can't believe this got 77, it should have at least 95.Problem, though.. if you use a standard or PS3 controller, some of the controls trigger themselves automatically and that can be really frustrating. Especially when it happens in crucial parts of a level. I'm actually adapted to having a constant worry as to whether or not he'll do one thing or another (almost always just quick step left) at any time. Some stages can't even be cleared using a controller.Xbox 360 for windows only, basically.That aside, recommended for everyboy everywhere who has a need for speed and digs nostalgia. But the game DOES bring back old gameplay, which can quite drag on. The modern stages are very thrilling, and in most cases, have a closer resemblence to the original stages.			",67,11,7,3,12,0,0

												3 different eras, 2 Sonics, 1 epic adventure. The Best looking Sonic game for now, Sonic Generations is pure epic game where you can play as Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic. Game features a great story, gorgeous graphics, amazing soundtrack, nice gameplay. It also features 9 different levels from first to last Sonic games re-designed especially for this game. Also lot of challenges for 2 Sonics to test their different skills. By clearing stages you get points which you can spend on different upgrades. Crazy speed, jumping over obstacles, defeating different bosses, everything awaits you here. Fans will be amazed and newcomers will be blown away by unbelievable speed and different landscapes. So go grab it it's a Sonic game you musn't miss. Happy birthday Sonic, may you be with us for many later years and amaze us with your speed as always.			",365,12,2,16,14,1,17

												Do you feel that the Sonic franchise is obsolete or dead? Sonic Generations may change your mind. By combining both worlds: side-scrolling platforming with speed elements and full out 3D speed segments with minor amounts of platforming, Sonic Generations has managed to create something fresh amongst the billions of indie platformers and first-person shooters.If you used to be a fan of the series, the general setting of the game may be of interest to you. Essentially, Sonic's sent back through time to revisit iconic levels in the flagship titles with some new twists. This time however, the perspective is skewed to two different angles. Each bring up a ""What if"" scenario with the game's release date and design. Classic Sonic turns the level into an early 90s platformer, questionably the music as well. Modern Sonic on the other hand, shows the level if it was made and designed around the last couple of Sonic games (the good parts, not the bad). It's a short game, but cheap. Try it.

												The best Sonic Game to come out, in my opinion, since Sonic Adventure 2 Battle. This game is incredible in every way, an awesome throwback to the type of gameplay that put Sonic on the map in the first place. THIS is what they should be expanding on, not this Sonic BOOM bs. Take notes Sega, look at the consumer reviews. The Sonic games that play like the originals always score higher in user satisfaction than these other ideas you guys are spending too much time on.

												My first Sonic game(even though it is one of the oldest series in the history)It blends both old and new style of gameplay but not actaully mixing them together meaning you pay old school or or play new style(except for the end part)The game itslef runs well once you are playing the only issue with the gameplay i find is that the powerups were not explained well and I already finihsed most of the campaign without even equipping one.The game is also short if you concentrate on just playing the campaign which i tend to do since I'd rather spend it on other games.i will probably play 1 strictly old school Sonic game and 1 new sonic game in the enar future ",1187,472,41,92,96,10,144

												in this co-op 2-player platform-em-up, you can play as either Sonic or the Son of Sonic as you jump, dodge and roll your way to several stages inspired by earlier Sonic games. all the way from Green Hills Zone (you might remember this from Sonic Adventure 2, where it was a secret level!!!) to The Floating Sanctuary (one of Knuckle's stages in Sonic Adventure Director's Xut) or even the mysterious Crying Cities (from the smash hit Sonic The 2005, the game which represented the blue bombers breakthrough in the West), this game is sure to tingle your nostalgia senses. the gameplay is stellar, for the most part - all the parts where you play as Sonic are great, but playing as the Son of Sonic is sometimes a little slow, which is strange since sonic is about going fast. more imporntantly, the plot is marvellous - it borrows heavily from games such as Nier, as the narrative mostly focuses on Sonic's relationship with his son, the Son of Sonic.Sadly, you can not play as Shamwow the ♥♥♥♥♥♥. this is a definite flaw.SCOREA graphic: 4/10 (some of the level designs look outdated)Speed: 50% (the Son of Sonic is not as fast due to being tiny bby hadgehog)Rings: this game has'emMusicals: 7/10 (i would have liked to hear some more classic sonic tunes such as ""Knuckles Pumpkin Song"" or ""Knuckle's Water Level Song""TOTAL SCOREY-			",1056,412,51,127,132,12,182

												Blue Comet is gotta go fast! Or not. First few classic levels are fun, then after 3D games levels it goes downhill. Modern Sonic is not fast, old Sonic is literally slow walking, not being able to maintain speed ups and slowing down, occasionally even stopping from his spinning animation. And then there is pacing problem with modern Sonic, where you are boosting and then level designer decides that you should suddenly stop and do some platforming.Boss fights are not good, some poorly thought out gimmick levels where you have to hit boss once to win. Who thought that this fits 'gotta go fast' motto?This is not the worst Sonic game. If you suffered thorugh previous 3D games this is good Sonic game, it is just not a good game overall.

												Generations is generally considered to be one of the better new Sonic games, but I have no idea why.  The controls are sluggish, the level design is a linear tightrope with perpetual deathdrops if you deviate from preset path, the game puts more emphesis on 'tricks' than anything else.  Sonic games used to be great.  This one, it goes through the motions but I didn't have any fun at all.  If you want a good Sonic game, pick up one of the original Genesis ones, which are also on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												+ Looks nice+ Main stages are mostly enjoyable- I can't go 10 minutes without the camera getting stuck behind the geometry, Sonic getting stuck in momentum going back and forth on a loop-de-loop, some other graphical glitch, or the game crashing.- Control inputs just don't work some of the time. Multiple times a stage the jump button doesn't register and that's a problem.- Challenge stages are mandatory to unlock the boss fight after you finish the main areas for that chapter. This wouldn't be THAT big of a problem if the challenge stages weren't shoddy modes that played poorly.- The level select is needlessly complicated. It's shocking how difficult it is to just find they keys you maybe unlocked from the challenge rooms and the challenges that correspond to any of the 3 keys in each chapter. I shouldn't be getting frustrated trying IN THE LEVEL SELECT! Unbelievable the only part I would need a guide is the MENU. That's just terrible design.The negatives absolutely crush what's good about this game. As is I can't recommend it.			",423,113,5,67,31,2,46

												polecam tą gre z całego serca fabuła jest wciągająca  i klimatyczna ,chociaż gra ma parę drobnostek które ostro przeszkadzają w ukończeniu na 100% przede wszystkim sterowanie postac porusza sie z opuźnieniem przez co skok czasami trzeba klikać kilka razy inną sprawąjest to że w rużnych częściach poziomu sonic porusza sie z rużną prędkością przez co nie ląduje tam gdzie trzeba niekture zadania dodatkowe są zbyt frustrujące przez te cechy a czasem zdarzają sie zwykłe bugi jak w każdej grze od np sonic przeleci przez pocisk  i zostanie zraniony dalej bo gra uzna ze cośjest nie tak itp. tym nie mniej gra warta wyłóżenia kilku euro .

												The game that singlehandedly made me realize I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about Sonic the Hedgehog anymore. I hate his floaty platforming, I hate gimmick stages being forced upon me to progress, I hate boss fights where I have absolutely no idea what's even going on but I'm winning?? maybe?, and I hate that this port has random sections where all of a sudden, your mortal enemy Framerate the Slowdown will show up and OOF there's a spike/pit/enemy/other hedgehog (Hedgehog? do I capitalize Goku-powered animal-types?) and you're ♥♥♥♥ed, try again and hope it's not baked into the level.Probably the least offensive Sonic game that isn't Colors, it's not atrocious by any means, and the mod someone made that lets you turn the game into (the day stages of) Sonic Unleashed will DOUBLE its value if you're wondering about buying it, but ♥♥♥♥ this, I'M out.

												Every other game in my library, I just click ""play"" and it works. This one is borderline unplayable. Don't ask me how I made it to ten hours, I haven't been able to play it on this computer or my newer one at all. It never plays above 25fps, sometimes grinding down to 15 or less, and the forums suggest jumping through a hundred hoops and installing a bunch of programs that don't seem to work. And even before I had graphics problems, it was input problems, crashes, and other errors. I bet the console versions don't have this problem.			",87,9,0,3,3,2,4

												My computer vomits everywhere when I try and play this game:-Xbox controller is terribly optimized. Classic Sonic sometimes goes backwards for no reason, and I couldn't stop him from jumping backwards into spikes over and over, and he basically would refuse to crouch 9/10 times. I have a new licenced Xbox One controller (that is being recognized as 360 by the game). The demo actually had better input.-I don't have a gaming PC, but my computer can run some games very well. This is one of the only games I've ever played that is a laggy mess that made the word ""refund"" instantly pop up in my head.-The only part of the game that doesen't lag is the title screen-I couldn't get past level one because of all the other problems.I seriously hope Microsoft makes the 360 version backwards compatible so that I can actually play this game on a console. I've only played 2 other Sonic games (CD and 2) and I really wanted to try one with Modern Sonic in it.2/10 because the title screen looks good			",46,4,0,2,2,2,0

												Not only a solid return to form for the high-octane hog, there's also plenty of meat on it's bones with many stages, bosses and various challenges to complete, along with unlocking new skills and content along the way.   Less a mere franchise addition, more a full-blown trumpeting tribute to Sega's previously mistreated mascot - and it pulls it off with aplomb.A stonking soundtrack, sporting a great many classic tunes, both remixed and originals from previous games, tops off a gorgeous, colour drenched platformer that caters for both explorative, find all the secrets play to simply tearing through the stages at as ball-blistering a speed as possible.    Great stuff.			",395,36,17,27,12,0,35

												Sonic's first comeback since the games on the Sonic Heroes Engine (games like Shadow The Hedgehog Sonic Riders 2: Zero Gravity and of course Sonic Heroes) you play as Modern Sonic and Sonic from the years of Sonics 1 to just before Sonic Adventure (not sure what game it is) it's fairly short at 9 stages and two acts for eatch stage for you to play as Sonic and his younger self and 6 bosses (5 if you don't include the final boss) In Sonic Generations you play most of Sonic's best stages (i mean best because there are some stages that arn't there that are good like Cool Edge stage in Sonic Unleashed and metel harbour for Sonic Adventure 2 and even emarald Coast from Sonic Adventure but rooftop run is good enough). This version of Generations doesn't have everything unfortunitly. The only thing it doesn't have is the meggadrive emulator for Sonic 1 but since the PC already has a few genesis emulators who cares? Also theres a little suprise in intro for the final boss.Also the community has forced modding into this game (i think) and there are already a set of awesome mods from rendering patches like FX Pipeline to the Unleashed project and even Unleashed Sonic Himself (mostly the Unleashed Sonic model has a few animation glitches here and there, although they are mostly in-game cinimatic issues.)Also this game is good to play when your feeling stressed, sad or possibly angry since the music makes you feel better and the gameplay brings you back into the real world, even though the game is (like basically all the 3D Sonic games) one of the easiest games i have ever played, although that isn't a bad thing but the chalanges also mix things up a little, you have a few perk-based chalanges (the one i liked the most was the Endless Bost chalange) aswell as your generic ""beat your doppleganger"" chalangers (and no before you ask it isn't a modern version of Metal Sonic unfortunitly.)Also as i mentioned earlier this game has a few perks which can be small things like giving a free boost at the begining of a stage if you hit your boost key at the right time, extending boost bar and/or giving a regenerate boost bar, to perks which speed you up and reduce the speed penalties from going up slopes or running in water, and even some OP or semi-OP perks like Time Break (which *SPOILER* the final boss uses) and Super Sonic which have perks and cons like with Super Sonic you can fly while you boost and your invincible but you lose rings overtime (which would be obvious if you played as Super Sonic or any super form in any Sonic game) and boosting drains your rings faster, and Time Break slows down the game time (including Sonic which gives you more time to react and can be useful at times) but the stop watch still runs at normal time or faster making Time Break only useful when going back through the stages for the emblem Red Rings.

												Mediocre game at best in my opinion, I played for as long as I could, I quit when I found out that you are guaranteed to lose the Silver fight if you don't have enough boost.Here are my main issues with Modern Sonic and his levels-For some reason there are two sets of controlls for moving side to side, there's the analog controls which steers you in that direction, and then there's the left and right bumpers that move you over to that direction.But you are still required to use the analog controlls in order to move forward, while still having the wonky steering controls attached to it, making it easy to go off course and die.-If you are going faster than walking speed, you have no time to react to anything in front of you unless you know what's going to happen beforehand, this wouldn't be so bad if it didn't lead to losing lives very frequently.-Bashing into a flying enemy can often lead to you just fall to your death if it was so much as an inch away from it's top height.-There are a lot of sections where you're expected to either to slow down extremely or stop entirely in order to do some platforming, neither of course becomes apprent until you smack into it and lose your rings/die.-You're never fully explained what anything does or what button you're suppose to press.-Sometimes mechanics are introduced with no explanation at all.As the game goes on it becomes clear less and less thought was put into levels as development increased, parts where a jump stops right in front of an enemy for you to slide into become more and more frequent, long stretches of road that lead straight directly into spikes are more common, level desgin as a whole gets worse as you progress.I havn't tried to play this with a keyboard because the game comes with no key binds for keyboards, it asks you to select keys binds for each button on a controller, which sounds awful.I'm sure if you're willing to put up with floaty controls, imprecise movement, and horrible level desgin, you'll enjoy this game better than I did.

												This game is amazing, but a glitch causes it to turn your controller off, preventing you from using anything but the keyboard as a controller until you exit and reload the game (I'm using an Xbox controller, but logitech controllers appear to have the same problem. After looking for a solution on forums, I realized that this has been an issue for years and it will probably never be fixed.Games like this just aren't the same if you can only use a keyboard.

												This game was meant as a kind of museum to sonic's history, but seeing as it's sonic mausoleum is much better description. A broken relic of sega's need to be edgy and beat nintendo. Seriously the controls are floaty and the platforming is terrible, speed as a central mechanic is also completely ridiculous, platformers require prescision and forethought but how are you supposed to do that when slightly tapping in any direction sends you careening off the edge of a platform. It succeeds in being a look back at Sonic's history and if that's what you want go for it but if you've gained some common sense and lost the rose tinted glasses then avoid this monstrosity that can only be described as an old, drunk out of shape Sonic wanking in a mirror			",345,42,5,19,21,1,35

												Biggest issue for me is that Classic levels, which were the main reason for me to buy the game, are incredibly boring. They have absolutely no flow, very far from that perfect mix of speed and platforming of the Genesis classics, and they also lack uniqueness aside from a couple of gimmicks. I also experienced a weird issue with the controls of Classic Sonic: attempting the ground roll sometimes just randomly stops your momentum (instead of enhancing it) and some other times just... doesn't work.I surprisingly found myself enjoying way more the Modern levels: overall they are fine, but I think SA2 is probably the better choice if you want that kind of gameplay (disclaimer: I'm saying this but I don't know if the PC port's any good, I played it on Dreamcast several years ago).The extra ""Challenge"" levels are ridiculously repetitive, every single one I tried basically was ""repeat a portion of the level you just played with no challenge whatsoever, but oh wait here's a totally irrelevant gimmick that'll make you think you're doing something different"". Spoiler alert: you won't be doing anything different.It's just really mediocre overall and not worth its full price, although I'd recommend it on a sale if you're a diehard Sonic fan.

												Basically, except the ""remastered"" core 2D gameplay and a few good music tracks, everything here is between ""mildly irritating"" and ""batshit awful"". 3D-Sonic levels suffer from little to none playtesting, and so are flooded with both technical and design missteps. This situation tops at bosses -- they annoy and bore at the same time, and are completely screwed up with bugs. By the way, ""annoying and boring"" is also true about cutscenes -- I can't call them a story, it's just that -- and every single character, both Sonics included (yep, the ""old"" Sonic does alright with being unbearable and mute at once).That said, gameplay is not brilliant at all. Levels for 2D-Sonic are mostly okay, although they suffer from several strange design decisions. Favorite case -- signs for death pits placed in such manner they rather mock your fatal error than give valuable info. Ironically, 2D-sections for 3D-Sonic (oh yeah, his levels aren't 100% 3D, with constant frustrating shifts of perspective) might play somewhat better because of ""modern"" Sonic's moves serving as last chance of escaping stupid death. If you won't step into another glitch, of course.But all could be forgiven (or tolerated) if the assets are great. Well, first of all, there are not much of them: only nine locations, each from a different series' entry, and each divided between two Sonics -- 18 levels, plus horrible bosses (and a miriad of challenge missions that reuse main levels). Decent amount, but certainly not a great nostalgic trip to all the places of glory. I don't give a damn about modern Sonic games, so I don't particularly hate them -- but only one location per each of the first three games? Come on already. That just doubles the bad taste from poor QA.All in all, too much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for a few good moments. If this is the ""best Sonic game since Sonic & Knuckles"" as some internet folks say, all the others must've been flat out horrible.			",278,81,9,19,13,1,28

												I had a LOT of fun with the main game. Honestly, probably the most fun I've EVER had with a Sonic game. I'd highly recommend that bit. But all the asinine side missions and ""rival battles"" really slow the pace of the game down, adding in extra mechanics for the sake of jsutifying the ""Sonic and Friends"" theme that they could have easily dropped for this title. Since you have to do the side quests to progress with the main game, it gets a thumbs down; however, if you're willing to put up with a long block of chores in between the main game, the stages themselves are fantastic and really breathe some life back into the franchise.

												The game is great, the levels are a lot of fun and there are always new events taking place that pull me in further, however, I've got to say that this game was incredibly lazily ported to PC. All of the prompts tell the player to push the XBOX equivalent controls, and the controls are awful! The game tells you to push the Y button when you need to be pressing ""W"" on a keyboard. You can't reassign the controls either, which annoyed me to no end. You WILL die many times because of the fact that the game will tell you to quickly push certain buttons at certain times and you won't know what the game is referring to. Other than the fact that the game is a very lazy port, it's a good game, but I haven't been so annoyed with a games controls in quite a while. I would recommend buying it for the console it was released on, certainly not on PC.			",131,36,1,10,5,1,10

												This is probably the best Sonic game of all time, however, that isn´t saying much.I can´t stress this enough. This is a Sonic game. If you buy a Sonic game, it´s because you want to go fast. I shouldn´t have to wait for a platform to come back or for the level event to end to continue moving. If I wanted to do that, I could´ve easily bought a Mario game. Some levels are extremely long, and horribly paced, and at times when you want to go fast, the game will simply not allow it by placing an enemy that, unless you´ve played the same level over and over again (seriously, this game borderlines on trial and error, a lot), you won´t see coming, stoping you dead on your tracks.I´d recommend it if you´re a hardcore Sonic fan, and if you can deal with bad level design. And yes, the music is great, as usual.Also, why is this 2011 game so hard to run? Barely any graphic setting and no real way to adjust them. It´s not really well optimized.			",168,7,1,16,7,1,2

(Like leading a mule)-Modern/Future Sonic will glitch out at times so prepare to die and/or reset the game.-Modern/Future Sonic's boss battle are terrible.( I beat them all but i didn't know what i was doing or what exactly what i was suppose to do.)-Annoying helpers constantly, and repeatly , tell you what you already know even when their are visual tips on the screen.  (like Navi from Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I found myself cussing at the game everytime they ""warned me"" and ""gave me tips"")-Don't care for the story.-The Hub world is bland and boring.-Must press the window button to exit to windows and close the game while is in minimized.Buy and play at your own risk.

												This is not a Sonic game.I grew up with the original Sonic games and the GBA Sonic advance series.What made them good includes:+Fluid controls+Easy to get speed back after a failure+Not jumping up tiny pointless ledgesThis game is none of that. The 2.5D to 3D feels nausiating and 'little Sonic' is like a fat kid chasing after an ice-cream truck. It feels sluggish.The port is horrible. Cutscenes are in 480p24 (or 30, not sure) and the voice acting is... Not terrible surprisingly. The control scheme IS NOT AUTOMATIC (!!!!) and requires you to map buttons to certain keypad stuff on your keyboard. There is a ""default"" button but it isn't the default. No idea why. Everything starts unmapped.There are no options for above 1080p60, so no 120Hz or 1440p for you unfortunately.Worst part of my experience was that ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial bot. I could have survived if it weren't for ""PRESS X TO GO FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAST""It all feels forced. I did not enjoy the experience.(For reference I've also played +2 hours at a friends house on his TV. This did not fix anything. We were both maxing it with no artifacts though, so if you like the console version then this will do you fine. The port isn't bad, just not up to enthusast standards, which I suppose isn't what Sonic is for, but it would be nice. Escpecially since Pirates/Emulators CAN run these things at 4k144 which sucks for steam users.)			",70,4,2,2,4,0,2

„I beat You all the time by myself Eggman, and now there’s two of me!” ~Sonic The above quotation sums up the whole idea of this new Sonic installment pretty well. What You get in Sonic Generations is more of the same, proven experience known from some of the  older SEGA productions.  Across the course of the game we revisit some iconic locations from the Sonic universe both in 2D and 3D incarnations, and once again roll through them with a blazing speed.Unfortunately the game does not introduce anything new, except more of the old ideas. Even challenges (called acts) assisting each main level feel somehow repetitive and in most cases waste their own potential. There are a few promising moments, but in most cases they’re ruined by numerous bugs, glitches and sloppy controls.As I said earlier, the whole idea about the game, and it’s main plot twist is an emergence of a mysterious time-eating fellow who “erases time”. This allows our heroes, namely Sonic and Tails, to team up with their previous incarnations on a quest to save all well-known Sonics friends. During our task we’ll be forced to beat each area twice, both with our “new” fully 3-dimensional Sonic, and his old-2D-only-self, once again collect all chaos emeralds, and finally beat time-eating creature.The plot is almost nonexistent, dialogues between Sonic and Tails feel stiff and does not encourage to explore the world. The case is similar with our friends, who once rescued reappear only to help us during certain, usually 2-3 minutes long acts, by performing certain special actions. Sadly those certain acts are usually affected by the highest number of glitches.There are only two good things I could say about this game, while recommending it to any non-hardcore Sonic fan would be the music and the modds. Music in this game is simply a collection of best pieces from the previous Sonic Games, which more than once proved itself to be one of the strongest points of the series, perfectly accompanying our high-speed runs through the world.As for the modding system it’s unofficial, but in my opinion the game improves dramatically after a few modds are installed. Luckily most of them come equipped with a guides allowing us to change the game drastically. Not only we are able to change our playable character, add new levels or even add new game modes, but also change already existing levels, or even affect controls of both Sonics.Summing up, the game is not bad, and I’d risk saying that it’s still, despite all its flaws, a solid Sonic experience. Unfortunately numerous bugs, glitches, poor plot, and terribly broken on-line mode make it feel like an unfinished product. So if You’re not some kind of hardcore-hedgehog fan, better avoid this game and get Yourself one of the older, proven editions.Pros:•	Refreshed classic levels•	Old music brought back to life•	2D and 3D gameplay mode in one gameCons:•	Extremely sloppy controls both with keyboard and X-box controller•	Booring plot, and repetitive side challenges (acts)•	High number of bugs and glitches•	Broken on-line mode•	Visibly unfinished product with a lot of wasted potential			",165,91,0,21,19,2,32

												An absolutely brilliant game visually, and I'm sure the original ports was brilliant, but the fact that the keyboard controls are so annoying does it for me.Plus, now my computer doesn't register any input I try in the configure section (and yes, I've looked up guides to help) despite the graphics being in the 'recommended' part of the product page, and so the game is completely unplayable until then.I'm coming back to this game if I ever try with a controller, but for now, it's not worth it.Original Game: 9/10Port: 5/10 (when it works)Edit: I've played about 10 hours of this game offline, hence the low time, before the configure tool played up.

												Okay i'm gonna get this outta the way... I had to install a crack i found online for this 14.99 game i bought with my hardearned cash for it to work..... The game is great but your better off getting the Console ports.If you want sh*t like mods then i would go get the demo and take the config tool out of there and put it in the maingame i heard that fixes it.  About the damn port its self, the port is really sh*tty i mean i had to put run it in 8 bit mode for it to run well and my pc is mid range and for this to be targeted to most kids who will most likely have a low end sh*tty PC this is a worrible port.PC port 3/10 Game itself gets a 7/10 Get it on Xbox or PS3(Want a good PC sonic game? get SADX or SA2PC!)

												I really want to recommend this game for it's fantastic level design and soundtrack, but there is just one problem that placed my review in the negative.The controls for this game are atrocious. Usually I play fast-paced platformers with a controller to give myself precise movement when going from point A to point B, but the fact that this game can barely keep the button input to controller really bugs me.  I can only play 10 minutes of the game before the game purposely messes up my controller scheme and I end up dying.  The majority of my deaths in this game come from this problem.SEGA, it's been 5 years since this game came out. Why havn't you fixed this problem yet?You people might be saying, ""Well, why can't you just get used to the keyboard controls?"" Because the keyboard controls feel wonky controling Sonic around; it works well with the classic stages since they are all 2-D, but in the modern stages is where the problem of controling Sonic comes in, since his stages switch to 3-D.  Modern Sonic feels stiff controlling with 4 directional buttons compared to the joystick of a controller.Overall, I would say just buy a console version of this game.  You will enjoy it better than this version. Unless someone can find a solution to the controller problem, I will not recommend this version of the game.			",23,5,1,7,1,0,1

Sega is the sniper, Sonic is the guy getting shot and fans of decent action platformer games are Private Joker, yelling at Sonic's fans to stop being idiots by trying to save this garbage franchise...

												If I could give this game something in the middle of liking and disliking it I would. I was recommended this game by a few of my friends, so I figured I would give it a try. So I bought the game and  installed it like any normal person would, but the moment I launched I realized how bad I screwed up. It booted into this configuration screen that showed a controller and had no buttons mapped. My first thoughts were ""What the ♥♥♥♥ is this"" (no joke) it took me about three different times of booting the game, and hitting every button before I realized that the controller was because Sega was to ♥♥♥♥ing lazy to actually program controls and graphics sttings into the game themselves, so they basically took the Xbox version and made it compatible with windows. I'm hoping to find a console version that isn't complete♥♥♥♥♥♥Edit: I have requested a refund, I want this ""steam""ing pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥out of my library.			",107,9,0,10,16,1,10

												First 2 hours are pretty great, but progressively gets worse and worse as the game goes on. Some of the later levels barely even feel finished, with tons of bugs and falling through levels non-stop. End boss possibly the worst I have ever encountered in a game. Almost feels that the developer ran out of money and just rushed it to get it out. Starts promising, ends poorly.			",295,59,4,30,26,4,20

												Sonic is one of the few games where the level design HAS to be perfect to be enjoyable and sadly it just isn't, unless you feel like playing the same map over and over again going constantly fast just isn't going to happen. When you well are going fast the warnings/objects are just too tightly packed for any sort of reaction time and it turns into a memorisation game.			",129,21,4,28,30,0,40

												Like most modern sonic games it's full of bugs and annoying characters with bad voice acting. The 2D sections are pretty fun but the 3D areas will frustrate you.

												There's nothing I can tell you about this game you don't already know. Sonic in 3-D remains as terrible an idea as letting John Romero make Daikatana. Sonic in 2-D handles about the same as Mario in New Mario Wii; that is to say, about as enjoyably as getting your nuts pounded on a dresser with a spiked bat. If you're like me and are willing to slog through all the dull parts because you're intrigued by the remade levels from earlier games, just save yourself the disappointment and money and go buy Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection. The idea that this game was made by professionals is both comical and an insult to other professionals. You could devote an entire college course to studying the myriad ways this game fails.

												Sonic Generations is the game that really took a good, long look at Sonic and answered the very important question: why did Sonic never make the jump to 3D successfully?The answer, unfortunately, is that Sonic was never actually all that good in the first place, and this game merely throws this into sharp relief.Sonic Generations' fundamental premise is a split between the past and the present - half the stages in the game are old-school, 2D platformer stages similar to what you would have experienced on the Sega Genesis, but with much nicer graphics, while the other half of the stages in the game are new, 3D platformer stages rather like those in the new Sonic games.You would think that the 2D levels, being ""good sonic"", would be better, and on the whole that's correct, but really, the 3D stages aren't terrible by comparison in many cases - sure, they do have some obnoxious things to them here and there, but many of them flow fairly decently.The real problem is that the game is never really excellent, even though the earlier stages draw very heavily on the first few sonic games for their stages and mechanics. The sad truth is that the game really points out what is wrong with Sonic - that going incredibly fast and precision platforming are utterly at odds with each other, and while the loop-de-loops and other things that Sonic goes through were cool back in the day when the graphics looked really slick, nowadays, even with top-of-the-line graphics, you realize that it just is spectacle - there's no real substance to those parts, while the actually substantive parts, while okay, are not amazing.The game isn't terrible, but it isn't great either; it is okay on the whole. If you want to play a 2D/3D platforming game, you could do worse - and would be, if you played any other modern Sonic game. But if you're looking for a great new game to play, I'd go elsewhere - the game is okay, not awesome, but, alas, Steam does not allow a ""meh"".			",507,173,10,70,51,7,84

												Well i have to say this game has impressed me. Not because it's good but because i'm amazed at how frustratingly angry it managed to make me. And simply put if a game can't be enjoyed because it makes you as angry as it made me then it's just not   worth it. The worst part is that this game has so much promise and has a lot of the elements of a great game but it's let down by some of worst controls i've experienced in a long time coupled with terrible camera angles, which combined detroyed my ability to enjoy this game. In this game you play as both classic Sonic in levels reminiscent of the Mega Drive era Sonic as well as modern Sonic (or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sonic as i prefer. I hate the way Sonic is now) in 3D levels.The Good:- the game does look beautiful and the visuals were the most impressive thing in this game for me. The levels have been lovingly designed and each one looks great. -the soundtrack is decent is well with remixed tracks from the older games which still sound good.- the 2D levels are good and play out almost exactly like the old MegaDrive ones.The Bad:- the controls. God they are terrible. I played with a 360 controller and found the controls laggy and unresponsive which in a game that is very fast is a recipe for disaster. - the awful camera angles. The amount of times the camera changes mid jump or during some other tricky maneuvere is ridiculous and leads to a lot of deaths. This is the last thing you need when the controls are as awful as they are.- The story is completely forgettable tripe but to be fair a good story has never been a necessity in a Sonic game.It really does kill me to have to slate this game because i feel it would have been a classic if not for those controls and camera angles. I wanted so badly to like this game but it just got to a point where i was to frustrated to even want to play anymore and it became an ordeal. I could only recommend this to hardcore Sonic fans. To anyone else just give it a miss. 4/10			",446,133,17,76,93,4,90

												I bought this game £5. Whilst it's certainly worth what you pay for, I definitely would not recommend this game. The story is ok at best, but the dialogue is so cliche and dragging. The side scrolling levels are the best bits, but when it gets to 3D sonic, it is terrible. Controls are not responsive, the homing attacks are a nuisance and most of the time you have no control of sonic whatsoever. There also plenty of side missions which is why I say this game is worth £5. But some side missions are repetitive, or just plainly uninspired. I got the feeling that TEAM SEGA really rushed making this game.5.5/10			",60,11,1,4,2,1,1

												This game is bad, just bad. I won't go into story plot because you already read 10k reviews on it.The music is pretty good. One of the first time i heard rycled music done right. They took the sound tacks from the first stages and brought them back.Graphic's why Sonic Generations is really cool.Play the courses as classic sonic is pretty fun. However play them as modern sonic just suck hard. Maybe the game is easier to play with a keyboard but i use the 360 controller. The modern sonic mission are bad because the controls are stupid broke in how sonic is controlled. He is given his light speed attack, pound, speed dash, and drift. I haven't played much but i dont understand drifting. What kills the for me is How easy modern sonic get's killed. His missions you have to play based on fine control at high speed but with a ""used/not brand new/ joysick the controls Over compinsat so hard that in less then a second im face grinding along walls until it changes and i die. When i turn the other way im alsmot instantly running my face along the other wall.I will save you some money and just say even if your a fan of sonic ""Don't buy this game."" Just go on your tablet/smart phone and buy Sonic dash. It is a very fun/understandable sonic game with it's own challanges.			",64,8,0,15,3,0,2

												Don't get me wrong there's a lot to like about this game. It's got a big nostalgiac feel and the game is extremely fun. However, I can't recommend this game. Pros:The gameplay and level design is awesome and really fun!The unlockables are cool (especially the music)Two play-styles that are equally fun!Cons:The story is lackluster and forgettable.The missions are hit and miss. Some are fun, some are frustratingThe game feels too short imo.Conclusion:There's a lot to appreciate in this game. The nostalgiac levels and dynamic gameplay is fun. The unlockables are really cool. However, the lackluster story and the dodgy missions really bring down the experience for me. 7/10 Would not buy again.			",141,17,2,21,10,4,25

												Sonic Generations is a love letter for anybody who played sonic on megadrive and dreamcast with fast  fast fast fast and more  faster gameplay than any version than before the gameplay consists of two play styles being  3D sonic running through linear levels in true sonic speed with boost pads placed and springs placed everywhere boosting and homing attack and then there is the 2D sonic going through levels in a much more slower pace but getting that orginal sonic feel and gameplay its a great change of pace not beacuse its slower its a alot more retro with 2D sonic not getting a single 3D level now the reason i can't recommened this game is beacuse its controls on pc beacuse they are not there infact the game displays xbox 360 buttons even while playing with kb+m and this can be extremely annoying another thing is the game lags very frequently even on high end hardware only buy this game if you are a true sonic fan and you have a XBOX 360 controller you must overall its a great title but the pc version is 1 too much money and the game controls are extremely broken for kb+m also the game can be annoying to set up but its a one time thing			",128,8,4,10,7,0,10

AUDIORemastered ClassicsVISUALHybrid Mash-upDIFFICULTYEasyVIBEBalancedCRAVINGDelightfulON SALEOccasionallyPROS:  It's fascinating to see how a level from the newer 3D sonic games could have looked in 2D, and vice-versa. The game plays rather fun in both modes, and when you're done with each 3D/2D level there are a slew of challenges unlocked for each stage. The game knows that a big driving force in the franchise is its awesome soundtrack and uses it to its advantage. It's a pretty definitive collection for what music the series has to offer! For once, Sonic's controls are spot-on. We haven't seen this in a long, long time.CONS: This installment is not without its glitches, despite its uncharacteristic polish. The bonus level for Rouge is badly glitched, the scoreboard is completely down, and some levels deal with game-crashing glitches. Not only is it the scene to be pointed to for how the story is horribly told through monologuing, but this boss single-handedly showcases the curse of Sonic The Hedgehog: The crash and burn that occurs when new, relatively untested elements are brought to the table. The final level is an absolute mess of poor conveyance, disorienting depth issues and various characters constantly distracting you with irrelevant tips.WORTH: This one goes on sale about five times a year for up to 75% off. However, Sonic steam keys get bundled often outside of Steam. You may want to try sites like Bundlestars and Indiegala, as they have sales with more frequency.OVERALL: It's not the beacon to the promised land people are making it out to be, but Sonic Generations is cool and has a fair amount of content to keep you entertained. It's the kind of game you want to get really good at, because success within it is satisfying as hell! The Sonic formula is composed of some very fickle elements, so the impression this one leaves of true balance is rather amazing.SCORE: 8/10                                                                     Full Review Coming SoonEdit: I have made it recently a personal policy to not recommend games with broken achievements. People may not discover this fact until after several hours of completionist play, and after experiencing that myself twice, I've found it to be unfair! whether or not you find the goals of completionists agreeable or foolish, I'd hope you can agree that achievements unattainable through any legitimate means are damaging to the community, as they promote hacking and developer carelessness for these established systems.

In some instances during Modern Sonic levels, Sonic will cartwheel constantly to the left, causing control to be taken away from the player.

												The graphics, music and levels in this game are pretty good, but the gameplay and controls on the other hand...You are not rewarded for trying to speed things up, one boost with modern sonic and you will end up in the water/lava/whatever is around the tiny platforms. The general controls are very 'slippery'. With retro sonic even you can't platform like you are supposed to and it's very annoying. With the wonky controls even pressing A twice will make you fling off way too far into the direction you weren't facing (with modern sonic). There's a lot of precise platforming required in this game and not being able to stop where you want to is very frustrating. The levels and bosses are easy and the only thing you will die from is falling in the water due to trying to go fast, pressing A when something to interact with just gets randomly deselected and you will end up in the water, and just not being able to change direction at all.To make it even shorter I liked the retro sonic levels a bit because they resembled the old sonic games slightly, and that's where it stops being a game and starts being a terrible experience (mostly gameplay wise).

												Call me crazy (don't really, because I'll get sad), but I don't like any of the 2D Sonic games. In fact, with the exception of Sonic Adventure 2 I don't like any of the 3D ones either.Sonic Generations is what has been described to me as the best of both worlds. To be completely honest, I don't know anything about the 2D levels (a friend played those, I did the 3D ones) because I completely tuned out when it wasn't my turn.The 3D levels, on the other hand, have two parts. The first being when the camera is behind Sonic, the player simply needing to make him sidestep occasionally while he runs. The second being when the camera is to Sonic's side, in which case you can run into enemies and walls repeatedly because there's no bloody way to see what's coming.To a non-fan, the ""story"" consists of Sonic dicking around through time and saving a buttload of characters you probably won't know and definitely won't like.Rating:♥♥♥♥♥♥10			",558,140,34,79,99,7,92

												This game is like your best friend's younger sister.  You're best friend is also probably classic Sonic.  This game is cute, and has fun on its own, and begs for you to play with it, but damn what a ♥♥♥♥♥.  This game is so finicky to get going, and never feels quite right.  If you like Sonic, you already own this game.  If you don't care about the series and want to play something that lives up to its hype, buy a console version that handles the way it should.Scale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=positive 5=lovedGame design: 3/5  It's not so much the game itself that sucks, it's the lack of options and compatibility.  Controller functionality is pretty much broken and who wants to play $30 for a Sonic game just to be forced to use WASD.  Plus, like most Sonic games, this one glitches out the♥♥♥♥♥ but I guess that's just part of the tribute to modern era Sonic.  Classic Sonic levels are suprisingly tight tho.Tone: 5/5 The story blows, but what do you expect for Sonic?  What do you expect for a crossover?  That is what this is right, generational crossover?  Regardless, this game is conceptually beautiful and comes together pretty nice.  Level designs capture both eras in a pretty real way.Personal skew: 2/5  I'd be all over this game if the developers seemed to give a crap about their product.  Thanks for porting to PC... Please fix it.			",782,402,17,105,75,6,113

												I beat it in less than 5 hours, it was way too easy and there was nothing else really to do except play the same levels over and over again with a slight variation. I bought it was on sale and even got the DLC.It wasn't worth it though, the game sucked.It took all the old songs, remixed them into trash.The only enjoyable parts were the quick segments from Sonic Adventure 2 which were hard to play with annoying remixed songs in the background.The plot sucked, because there wasn't one.This game really didn't add anything new but just present the same stuff in a poorly wrapped package.If you want a 3D sonic game I would recommend Sonic Adventure 2: Battle or Sonic Heros for a 2D just play the regular 16 bit original. I think I could reccomend any Sonic game over this one like Sonic 3D blast the isometric game was more fun and challenging.This game might seem enjoyable if you have never played what it is based on but you are really missing out if you haven't experienced the originals.

												I'm Sorry Sega, But I Don't Reccomend This Game At All, if you want to play sonic generations, get it for a console because this is just too much, i have it for XBOX and i love the game, but i only bought it again on PC for mods, and the fact that i have to set this games graphics to the lowest settings possible just to get barely playable speed is just not worth the time, and i dont want to buy a $10000 Super Computer just to function a game i've paid for with my own money even though my PC meets the max requirements, it's a good game alright, but if you want it, please get it for PS3/XBOX360 considering this is nothing but a port, causing its constant lag, All I Can Say Is Hopefully SEGA updates this very soon, because this is just ridiculous.It has a nice cover art tho, and feels really good to have in my library.

												I love Sonic the Hedgehog games and this one is no exception, sadly this version of the game is a mix of love and hate. This game makes me feel really nostalgic playing my old favourite levels in a newly designed world and amazing and the story for this game seems well thought out for what I've played of it, and the game just feels fast pace which was alway's one of Sonic's charms. The bad is the PC version of the game can be painful to play because it's has a few annoying glitches, some of the levels will cause the game to crash, and some of the cut scenes audio don't line up with voices and some of the cutscenes will just end abruptly to the point you feel like you misses something or don't notice it until the next cutscene. Some of these though annoying can be ignored but one glitch can not be ignored because it makes the game virtually unplayable the glitch happens when someone uses a non XBOX 360 controller, it seems random but when playing as modern Sonic will start to flip to the left of the screen, sometimes it may happen once or twice or never stop leaving sonic to constantly flip out causing me to die A LOT. I've also tried programs to fix this but nothing worked for me. my final thoughts would be to buy this game for your XBox 360 it's probably the safest bet, because this game is great but due to the issues listed above can be a pain to play.  The only way I'd recommend getting this game is if you buy the Sonic hits Collection pack, I was lucky enough to get it on same so I only paid $1 for this game but even if the pack is at full price of $30 paying $2 for each sonic game is a steal and if it works for you then bonus.Thanks for reading and I hoped this helped.

												GameplayYou know, I would have loved this game if the developers weren't so god damn convinced that anyone gives more than two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the bloody 3d sonic games.The 2d sections are a wonderful throwback to the original games and even the 2d sections of the new 3d games are quite enjoyable. But the 3d portions are littered with small platforms, unresponsive  controls.  Badly integrated gimmicks and quite frankly gameplay that would make sonic '06 look good. I haven't touched on the Bossbattles yet, In my oppinion the boss battles are the only time the 3d parts actually serve a purpose. Like with the rest of the game the developers pushed the gimmick of having half 2d and half 3d in the boss battles as  well  but since some if not most of the bossbattles are slower pased you can actually see where you are going and controll the character.  Sadly half of a decent game does not a good game make.  I couldn't force myself to finish the game.  Unless you really enjoy the 3d sonic games.  And if you do bless you for you have a much higher tolerance for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t than I have. I'd say pick up the game because its really clear that the developers tried to push that the most.  For anyone else I'd suggest that you veer away from this game.  A small note on the DLC  From what the dlc offers its quite clear that we don't have to look here for any improvement of the original game either. The Dlc merely offers some new gimmicks and not the throwbacks to some nostalgia that the package teases us with.ConclusionsAll in all I'd say that the franchise is running kind of stale. Where Super Mario 64 managed to embrace 3d and pull out something worth looking at.  Sonic never made the transition all that smoothly,  You just can't have a 3d platformer and keep the sense of speed that you want in a sonic game.   ",884,338,20,101,89,9,177

												In typical Modern Sonic style, the levels are all balls hard with too much visual clutter and zero reaction time. As a result, you can't tell what's coming up and you can't tell what's going on. If you manage to get something right, then it's generally either by chance or because you've replayed the same level 50 times just to try and nail that one impossible jump at high speed with lousy steering accuracy.It also seems very counter intuitive when using the boost ability causes you to miss almost every shortcut because you're moving too fast, so you end up taking the longer path with more obstacles and you end up wasting more time than you saved by boosting.For the record, it's a pretty bad design choice when selecting 'restart level' from the pause menu will reduce your life counter by 1, but quitting to the level select area then reselecting the level will not carry this penalty.Don't bother buying this. Go buy the Mega-Drive classics and play all the Sonic games there instead.			",354,90,10,43,20,4,51

It then starts to use levels from ALL the old awful 3D sonic games rather than use levels from the old school sonic games. The first 3 3D sonic levels are greats because there the old 2D levels updated. The rest after this is like bad sex with a fat girl knowing you cant finish the job because of how ugly she looks. The games over MEGA QUICKLY and theres no real replay value. This games ONLY worth it if it were £2.99 or something super low			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic Generations takes gamers on a romp through the history of Sonic the Hedgehog and, as a result, shows a bite-sized look at the downfall of their mascot.The story plays out like this, at a picnic for Sonic's birthday, all of his buddies including Tails, Knuckles, Amy and... everyone else... get sucked into a big portal thingy made by a big monster. Sonic follows and has to save them as they have been frozen in a big, white wasteland. Meanwhile, Sonic and Tails from the past have been scooped up as well and are also running through levels too because reasons.Sure the storyline is a bit ridiculous but that's fine. It's a great excuse to have Sonic play through reimaginings of his most iconic levels in both the original 2D style and the new 3D style of his more recent outings and it first, it's a blast. Only at first, though. The game works like this, there are three sections of the game consisting of three stages and a boss battle. Each stage has two acts giving a total of 18 levels plus four boss battles (because of the final boss). Act 1 of every stage has you playing as old-school Sonic in a 2D style while Act 2 lets you play as the newer Sonic.At the beginning of the game, this works out really well. I grew up with Sonic the Hedgehog and getting to play through the reimagined Green Hill Zones and Chemical Plant Zones were wonderful. Not only that, but they actually gave me a greater appreciation for the newer style of Sonic the Hedgehog. 2D Sonic was great but I often found myself missing the homing blast and greater ability set of older Sonic of which younger Sonic is missing all but his iconic spin dash. Once you get through a set of three levels, a huge glut of 30 challenges unlock that have you playing through the levels with different variations such as ghost races or playing with one of Sonic's friends. It can be overwhelming but the game only makes you try one from each stage in order to unlock three boss keys bringing you to the boss fight. It's a great way to add additional content without forcing players into repetition.Unfortunately, as the game progresses, the level design starts to reflect the newer games which is far from a good thing. the Sonic '06 level takes you into a firy apocalpyse where you have to avoid a giant flame tornado and from here on, the whole game starts going up in smoke. Levels start throwing ridiculous obstacles in your way and seem to actively prevent you from enjoying the speed previous levels have enjoyed. Whereas before you got to skateboard down a hill chased by a giant, demon-possessed truck, now the ground is broken up with near-constant stops and barriers. Playing as 2D Sonic, it was a blast getting to spin dash and enjoy the rush of speed but now, spin dashing will only bring you less than a second before you run into a wall that simply doesn't need to be there. The 3D Sonic fares better in these stages but he's not immune from their effects either. Levels start frequently using newbie traps that aren't challenging as long as you know they are there, bringing your fun to an unnecessary stop seemingly just to prevent a perfect run on the first try. Also, the camera starts doing very funny things, trying to work around all the jumble of visual assets that frankly don't need to exist. Depth is also a very tough thing to judge in the 3D levels, frequently resulting in missing rings and rails that require a specific type of jump.Despite the dire nature of the game, Sonic '06 is far from the worst. In fact, one of the better rated Sonic games in recent memory, Sonic Colors, results in easily the worst of the bunch. Requiring ridiculous power-ups to move forward that constantly result in slowing down and finding the ability means these levels take easily over 8 minutes each, a near-eternity for a Sonic game. Considering the powers weren't fun to begin with, 8 minutes of near constant power-up hunting is a slog that no one should have to suffer through.*Possible minor spoilers below. Seriously, quite minor though. Skip paragraph if you so choose.*So you've beaten all the stages, gotten all 7 Chaos Emeralds and are ready for the final battle. It's Super Sonic time, right? Well, I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying yes (this is Sonic after all), but you're in for the worst time as Super Sonic ever. The movement is so incredibly unresponsive and your objective is so unclear that I actually wanted this segment of the game to end, the first time I've ever thought that playing as Super Sonic in any of the games prior. It wasn't a power rush but actually made me feel like I was completely out of control of the character as he did whatever he wanted. You can switch between 2D and 3D on the fly during this battle but I'm still not sure what the point of 2D was as it never did any damage to the boss. Maybe I missed something but, in that case, why was it not clear what I was supposed to be doing?*End spoilers*Ultimately,  Sonic Generations starts off great and crashes and burns as it progresses, basically just like Sonic the Hedgehog. Still, this is probably the best Sonic game since Sonic Adventure 2 and there is plenty of fan service ranging from unlockable concept art to music from the games. Saying this is the best Sonic game since 2001, though, really isn't saying much. If you are a Sonic fan like me craving a good, modern Sonic game, this is the closest you will get. If you are a Sonic skeptic, however, this won't change your mind.			",398,129,9,74,53,3,83

												Classic Sonic is not well thought out.He has 3 shield powerups, all which are implemented into the game, but never placed into the levels.  So instead, you get them as loadout items, with only one use for every spawn.  Also, Classic Sonic has a skateboard loadout powerup which allows you to equip a skateboard at any time, but it's only a single use per spawn, rather than a toggle.  The board doesn't have a ""turn around please"" button; I tried skateboarding in Green Hill and turned around because I bumped into... the ground?  So I had to ride the board until I bumped into a wall at the beginning of the stage.Modern Sonic might be better, but I was excited about Classic Sonic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic Generations:  We tacked on Friends and Lame Remixes but Sonic's Finally 2D again just like you wanted.Nevermind that Sonic Colors already did this AND made the most out of the new voice actors AND had the best soundtrack of the Sonic series, Classic Sonic's back!Very linear progression feels restrictive, postgame gives you the breathing room you deserved from the start.Sure you can replace the crummy Generations remix of Super Sonic Racing with the original, you just have to know where it is. You won't.Lots of things from Colors, like the red ring system, scoring system, etc. are flat out not present in this game. Seemingly obvious decisions for where to put effort into like a timer UI for Spike Wisps don't exist, instead replaced with an abundance of worthless/mundane gimmicks in the missions.Vector why. of all of Sonic's Friends everyone thinks you're the Worst now because of this game.recommended for those who want their Sonic nostalgia squandered in a mediocre manner.

This review is based on my own experience with the game. I understand that other people may have more positive experiences than I did, but this review isn't based on that. This is about the troubles I faced trying to get this game to work, and the terrible response the game gave me in return. Thank you for understanding.Sonic Generations is a great game. The intense platforming style of Sonic is one of the greatest gaming experiences that you will ever play. But the game was definitely made with consoles in mind.The story in Sonic Generations is definitely generic, but it's not dislikeable. All of Sonic's friends have prepared a birthday picnic for him. Before they know it, everyone is sucked up by 'time holes' and scattered in different places in history. Sonic is then knocked out by the Time Eater, who created the time holes, and ends up a sort of purgatory, known only as White Space. He then rescues Tails, only to find that they both have previous versions of themselves, a 3D version of their original forms in the earlier Sonic the Hedgehog games. Both of the Sonics then have to travel through time to rescue his friends and stop the Time Eater.I have no problems with the game itself, and from what I have seen, it runs perfectly on the PS3, Xbox 360 and 3DS. But the PC port of Sonic Generations was awful. If you have never used an Xbox controller before, you're in trouble, because the game has all the controls written out with A, B, X and Y. This makes keyboard controls confusing, and I often sat there trying to remember what the Enter button incase I stuffed something up.The game also performs poorly, and even with the graphics on medium, I was only getting around 15-20 frames per second on a PC that could handle other games of the same graphical quality well. I was extremely disappointed, and also did not enjoy the settings for the game, which opened in a completely different window, and were confusing to change.Fortunately, I kept this game installed knowing that Microsoft was soon releasing the drivers for the Xbox One controller, so I plugged it in, hoping that Sonic Generations would respond to that. It did, and I was able to play the game well. But, being that I was recieving a minimal frame rate, I lost interest and played other games that I enjoyed and knew ran well.To sum up, Sonic Generations looks like an amazing game for console, but poor PC porting means that desktop players are left with no choice but to use a controller, and tolerate a low frame rate. If you are looking at getting Sonic Generations, don't buy it for PC.3.2/10			",117,14,8,9,8,1,22

It is extremely frustrating having to play on my non-gaming screen.  Putting that aside there occasionally is also some bugs with the voice acting.  Other than these two things, the game seems like it would be quite a lot of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game feels slow and heavy when it's not uncontrollably fast. The inconsistency in the game's speed and lack of interesting story makes this game seem like a chore to complete. The levels you play on are extremely linear and are mostly memorisation-based. The soundtrack consists of beautiful remixes of past Sonic The Hedgehog music, but is far from making up for the flaws in the game's mechanics.			",134,7,3,13,9,1,2

												A game that proves a concept can be quite good, but in practical design ... horrendous.Did not hear good things about this game to begin with but I decided to give it a whirl anyway. What I got was a game wherein a component that should have been optional (challenges) was forced upon players as a requirement to advance past the first 'three' stages of the game.Not the best choice, Sonic Team.

												so with the ""success"" of Sonic colors and Sonic 4 they decided that more retro sonic should be made. here comes sonic Generations. some sort of time anomily wrecks the party onsonics birthday sucking him into some wierd time dimesnsion where he relives all his past; which is in glorius 3D HD. sounds  good right. well it is to a point. the controls suck as much as they have in the past few years. nothing as solid as the classic Sonic series. the faithful recreations are a nice touch of nostalgia but thats it. I got as far as satge 1 on highway when I gave up. I was willing to give this game its all as I liked most everyone up till SA, but I had to stop cuz I just cant play it. THE QA STAF AT SONIC TEAM SHOULD BE FIRED. along with devils details for this port. 1. WHEN YOU CANT SEE THE PLAYER AND ITS VITAL YOU DO, to accomplish a complex platforming bit (this is why 3D platforming is shunned), IT SHOULD BE A THING THAT ISNT OVERLOOKED BEFORE ITS SHIPPED.

												Well... it's a Sonic game. Would've been better if they just kept all the maps in the 3D sonic style since a lot of them have 2D sections anyway. All the 2D levels felt really forced and were slow and too easy. Forced challenges break up the fun of the regular levels (really entertaining) and boss fights (really annoying). The music is really awesome and probably the best part of the game with all the remakes of old tracks plus new original songs.Overall, it was decent but it left me wanting more of the Sonic Adventure-style maps (which is funny because that's one of the few popular Dreamcast games I didn't buy). If you're a Sonic fan this will be perfect for you but I can't really recommend it for anyone else unless you can get it for <$10.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												I don't understand why people claim this is a good Sonic game. Maybe it would play better if the controls weren't so unresponsive and if the camera in new Sonic stages made it easier to see where you were jumping. No amount of nostalgia for the better Genesis games can make this a decent game.			",207,21,3,23,7,2,4

The system requirements are flat out lies, unless the target frame rate is 25 FPS. There are very few graphical settings, the Xbox 360 button prompts cannot be disabled, and Nvidea video card owners suffer from a start-up bug which can prevent them from playing the game they paid for.DO NOT BUY unless your PC is a behemoth, and you don't mind doing some (read: a lot of) configuring.The game is fun, though.

												The game itself is nothing but a waste of money because it has levels that don't fit gameplay (or vice versa). In my opnion Sonic Colours was way better than this in terms of everything. By the way, Sonic Generations is very short and only has 18 levels and 43 bosses (not to also mention the stupid challenges). Okay, let's start off with classic Sonic's stages.Green Hill Zone: Bad, a stage that makes you feel that you need a homing attack. But some sections were really fun to speedrun through (no classic feel at all)Chemical Plant Zone: Good, homing attack doesn't feel like a requirement and it for some reason gives me the serious, but at the same time cute feel of the original stage. Most played classic Sonic's stage by me. Sky Sanctuary Zone: Awful, full of♥♥♥♥♥♥in the way (*cough-cough*EggRobo's*cough-cough*) and again the homing attack feels like a requirement.Speed Highway: Average, but an interesting stage. At some places homing attack does feel like a requirement, but if you can spindash right then you might start to actually like it.City Escape: Trolly, a stage that has a ot of♥♥♥♥♥♥in your way so I never enjoyed it. And the unexpected truck all over the place...Seaside Hill: Not recommended. I would definitely say that it's a lot more anjoyable to play the stage with the homing attack. Crisis City: Trolly again...Orange Roofs: I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Planet Wisp: I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Now for Modern stages:Green Hill Zone: Fits the gameplay, amazing music and cameras (and a beautiful Light Field). I've gotta love that Giant Chopper scene. I never imagined Green Hill Zone would be that great before I played it...Chemical Plant Zone: Awesome at the start. Both 3D and 2D sections are enjoyable. But it's hard to get on the rail at the last part. And again awesome music.Sky Sanctuary Zone:♥♥♥♥♥♥IN THE♥♥♥♥♥Speed Highway: Good at the start. If you can stay on the top pathways then it's one of the most enjoyable modern stages.City Escape: Y U DO THIS, SEGA & Sonic Team?Seaside Hill: The stage itself is slow-paced but it seems to quite fit the gameplay.

												I am sorry, if you are a Sonic guy, i am simply not. Since ever, the controls and the level design has me confused.Is it now about speed or exploration? Why is there a timer if there are objects to collect spread over the levels? If you are suppossed to be fast why are there so many jumping passages that simply stop the player dead in their tracks? Why are there moving platforms and narrow jumping passages when Sonics movements is based on momentum, causing you to repeatedly slip off platforms simply because Sonics physic is simply not made to stop on a dime?Sonic is and was always confusing to me.All of this is evidently a case of taste and this game is in no way a bad product itself.

												This is honestly not a very good game. I expected a lot after all the praise I read but I don't see it.As someone that enjoyed the oldschool Sonic games this game did not hit the spot. The classic 2D sections had clunky physics stemming from the 3D engine(I fell out of the very first level in my first try even fffs) and the 3D Sonic sections are as horrible to play as I always thought they looked like. There seems to be a lack of quantity in levels and I was disapointed that the Flame-Blitz-Bubble shields were not used to design levels and instead used for challenges and unlockable skill.I will say that the developers made the most of the game by offering challenges, ratings, hidden red rings for every level. So if you enjoy it then you have a lot of extra playtime in this package to unlock stuff.The music is also very nice with many of the hits.I give this a thumbs down because Valve can't be arsed to implement a proper rating system and I think you should just go emulate or buy the roms if you are looking for 2D Sonic fun because this is -just- an ok game.

If you like Running, and fast paste platform you would like this. If you like 2D Side scrolling, retro speedy platforming  With Classic Sonic you'll love this alot...(unless you'r a dirtbag that game needs to be one style), and 3D Platforming Running of awesome fun with Modern Sonic (unless you'r that kind of Dirtbag who makes a Huge issue of ""WHY HIS EYES ARE GREEN!!""). I played this game and i was stuck playing this so much, i couldn't get off anything related to Sonic The Blue  Blur. This to myself the BEST SONIC GAME EVER SO FAR!!! and gives hope for Modern Sonic that he can have a good game. This is the first to break the infamous sonic cycle, lets  hope it stays broken			",88,3,2,6,3,0,5

												Best Sonic game ever.  A good blend of gameplay from 2d and 3d games released from years ago.  Graphics look excellent and run great on modern systems.  Highly recommended for fans of the series.  Plays well with an Xbox 360 controller.  Update: now that I have finished it I will report the last several levels are not as fun and quite difficult.  End bosses are also not as fun.  I think the last levels are from Sonic games I did not play, like Sonic Colors.  Still an outstanding game overall.  May want to check faq's on beating the final bosses though.			",64,5,7,5,0,0,1

It's hard to trust a Sonic game when SEGA has thrust the franchise into the ground, but I have to say, this does a great job of bringing back the brand.  There are many reasons to play games: new ways of thinking, artistic appreciation, exploring new genres, but this one has the most important quality: it's ♥♥♥♥ing fun as hell.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Meine persönliche Jump´n Run Referenz der letzten Jahre und eine Messlatte für alle Jump´n Runs, die mit den Genregrößen aufschließen wollen.Das Jubiläumsspiel des blauen Schalligels macht seinem Namen alle Ehre und fährt sämtliche Geschütze auf. Die Musikuntermalung kommt wie gewohnt von Crush 40, vielmehr ist es eine Kompilation guter alter Stücke, die neu aufbereitet in das Hauptspiel implementiert wurden.Die Level lassen uns in Erinnerungen schwelgen, da es sich um Neuflagen alter Serienteile handelt, z.b Green Forest (Sonic the Hedgehog) oder City Escape (Sonic Adventure 2),in diesem Falle handelt es sich jedoch nicht nur um eine grafische Generalüberholung, sondern vielmehr um eine komplette Umstrukturierung der gesamten Levelarchitektur,überdies sind die Level jeweils in 2D und 3D gehalten und mit der jeweiligen Sonic Figur anwählbar. Das Geschwindigkeitsgefühl ist schwindelerregend gut und dank der hervorragend justierten Kamera geht die Übersicht nie flöten.			",71,7,2,3,2,0,6

												If you're a Sonic fan... if you, like me, played the first sonic game on the sega Genesis/Mega Drive back then when it was brand new... do yourself a favor and buy this game.The game shows you it's roots... and how he is proud of them. On the very first level you will notice it's the game you loved when you were a kid.			",1226,370,42,172,117,11,227

												There hasn't really been a whole ton of really good platform games in this current generation of games, but Sonic Generations really stands out as not just being one of the best platform game this generation, but the best 3d Sonic game to ever be released.Sega fixed everything wrong with previous games and made a really fun game. Controls are tight, it has great graphics, and an amazing soundtrack. Buy it nao.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a port! The Xbox 360 Version was just ported to PC. DO your self a favor by getting the console version. Also The controls are a little wonky....SO don't feel bad if you die a couple of  cheap deaths. Overall Satisfaction: Meh...it's safe to say that Sonic is good again....if you play on Console. If you are looking for Sega to do a Good PC game for once, you might as well have asked to move a mountain!			",96,20,1,11,11,1,3

												Meine persönliche Jump´n Run Referenz der letzten Jahre und eine Messlatte für alle Jump´n Runs, die mit den Genregrößen aufschließen wollen.Das Jubiläumsspiel des blauen Schalligels macht seinem Namen alle Ehre und fährt sämtliche Geschütze auf. Die Musikuntermalung kommt wie gewohnt von Crush 40, vielmehr ist es eine Kompilation guter alter Stücke, die neu aufbereitet in das Hauptspiel implementiert wurden.Die Level lassen uns in Erinnerungen schwelgen, da es sich um Neuflagen alter Serienteile handelt, z.b Green Forest (Sonic the Hedgehog) oder City Escape (Sonic Adventure 2),in diesem Falle handelt es sich jedoch nicht nur um eine grafische Generalüberholung, sondern vielmehr um eine komplette Umstrukturierung der gesamten Levelarchitektur,überdies sind die Level jeweils in 2D und 3D gehalten und mit der jeweiligen Sonic Figur anwählbar. Das Geschwindigkeitsgefühl ist schwindelerregend gut und dank der hervorragend justierten Kamera geht die Übersicht nie flöten.			",71,7,2,3,2,0,6

												This is, without a doubt the most fun I've ever had playing a platformer. It's the best platformer I've played with Rayman Origins and Ducktales Remastered right behind. Everything about it is so...perfect. The music, the animation, the visuals, even the gameplay for once, just fantastic. It's really the perfect Sonic the Hedgehog game. Basically what happens is that a mysterious monster has erased Sonic and his friends, as well as the young Sonic (Sega Genesis era) and Tails. Now, Sonic(s) must race through their past to restore it and their friends. Young Sonic's gameplay is more 2D, and is like the Genesis games with a modern touch (although light), and its great, as good as the old sonic games. In the modern Sonic sections, that's where the game gets great. They really finally did it. They made 3D sonic great. It combines the fast paced nature of Sonic Adventure 1, with the platforming of Sonic Adventure 2, and it works fantastic. Overall, I can't say enough good things about this game. Believe it or not, I was actually like, close to tears when I played this. The good kind of tears, it was just completely overwhelming to a long time sonic fan, its just so great. There are a couple bad things. One is very minor, and is that the main stages are a bit too easy. You have to try very very hard not to get below a B rank, and I only remeber running out of lives once, on a boss fight. Not to say that there aren't challenges though, there's lots of sub-missions that are plenty challenging, and there are a lot of them. And there are time records, all sorts of stuff to add lots of replayability. The collectibles are great, and its fun to team up with other sonic characters to accomplish them. Another thing that is a minor complaint is although the diversity in the levels is astounding, there are some times when I said ""wait, wasn't there a segment just like this in the previous level?"" This is also minor, and is present in most games, so its no big.Pretty much the last thing I can possibly say about this thing is that its kinda cheesy, it's adorably cheesy though, I'll be rolling my eyes, but honestly, this is pretty great for a Sonic game, which has had lots of uh...groan worthy writing in the past. Lastly, there's pretty much no story, its there, but it is pretty generic, but its fine, and obviously is there to provide context for this remix of games. Oh, and the boss fights are mixed, they're not great, but there's been worse, and the only real problem with them is the gameplay of it, in that they're simple, but I don't mind, really, they're not really awful like some.All in all, all of these complaints, I'm just trying to force myself to say something bad. You have to understand, it is a sensational game. If you haven't got it already, get it. Do it. Honestly the only reason that you wouldn't at least enjoy it a little bit is if you really, really, really hate platformers, or uh, action games, or fun. Buy itdo it			",613,121,32,53,89,12,153

												Play through old Sonic's games stages with Classic and Modern Sonic. The soundtrack is excellent and you can select the music you wanna play on stages. Unfortunately, the game's short and not much challenging. Also crashes sometimes. But if you played Sonic on Mega Drive/ Genesis you should got this one. You won't be disappointed.

												Was so great I forgot about Sonic 06. Not just forgot, forgave. Fantastic level designs. The reinvisioned retro levels for modern sonic were insane fun, chemical plants have never looked so good. The reinvented modern levels for classic sonic were just as great. My only complaint is that there weren't more levels, something the story hinders slightly. Which, nudge nudge, there are mods for out there if you look hard enough. Haven't used any personally, but even those look well done. Back to this game here, best thing I've played in a long time. HIGHLY recommended.			",65,6,0,5,3,0,1

												A love letter to all Sonic fans with reimagined stages from the series.  The soundtrack is killer with two remixes, classic and modern, of every stage in the game.  Something worth checking out for sure.  Not to mention that the modding community has made some really worthwhile additional content for this game truely worth checking out if you do decide to pick this up, such as including every single daytime stage from the game Sonic: Unleashed.

												This is the game that shows that the Sonic franchise is not a lost cause, fans need to stop complaining that Sonic games should be like this and be like that, and instead just ask that they should be good.Like I said in my Sonic 4 review, the reason why Sonic failed so bad in recent years, is not trivial things like Sonic's green eyes, homing attacks and Dr. Robotnik now being Dr. Eggman, the problems are SEGA and Sonic Team's incompetence, while Sonic 4 was made to be exactly what everyone wanted and still divided opinions, Sonic Generations has a lot of things that purist fans didn't want but still was liked by most people.The Classic Sonic stages did a much better job on capturing the essence of the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive games than Sonic 4, and unlike what those whiny fans say, the levels with Modern Sonic are also very likeable.The game has flaws and some parts are bad, like the Final Boss that I managed to beat and I'm not sure what I did, but overall this is a great Sonic experience, again, showing that there is still hope for this franchise.
