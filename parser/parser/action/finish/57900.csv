												People wanted this game to be bad, and that's the only reason people say it's bad.The game is far from perfect and the wait for it was far, far too long, but that does not mean it deserves a score of 52. The three main points people bring up for why this game is worse than the holocaust are very easily countered and I honestly don't think can really be used as ""cons"" at all.1.  Duke Nukem is too sexist. The fact that this complaint actually gains any traction whatsoever is really, REALLY stupid and it kind of pisses me off to some extent. Really? Duke Nukem being sexist? WHAT A HUGE SHOCK! That's the entire point, don't you guys remember? I could understand if you didn't find the jokes funny anymore, but that's not the devs' fault because they aren't any less mature than the ones in Duke Nukem 3D. If you didn't find the jokes funny then you simply grew up and don't find it funny anymore. Duke Nukem games aren't supposed to be some deep observation of the human spirit or the definition of heroics. Duke Nukem games are about guns, boobs and swearing. You get all three of those in this game, if you didn't like them here then you didn't like Duke Nukem 3D either.2. The graphics are terrible.  Uh, no, they really aren't, especially for 2011. It looks almost as good as Far Cry 2's max settings or even RAGE's high settings, just without DOF. This game looks REALLY good.3. It wasn't as groundbreaking as Duke Nukem 3D.  Seriously, guys? Duke Nukem 3D wasn't very ""groundbreaking"" either. The engine it used had already been used to make Witchhaven and Powerslave (on the PSX and PC, not on the Saturn) and DN3D didn't do anything with the engine that those two games didn't. Another thing I'd like to point out is that Quake came out before this one did, and Quake is an actual fully 3D game, DN3D is still 2.5D. Hell, Marathon came out a full two years earlier and that game's engine stomps BUILD's testicles.Was it a disappointment? Yeah, of course it was. I was pretty disappointed with Half Life 2 because the violence was somewhat toned down and there weren't nearly as many weapons or enemies to fight. I felt like I waited too long for something that would have more in certain areas but way less in others. Disappointment does not mean horrible, though. Is Half Life 2 terrible? Not in the slightest. Is Duke Nukem Forever as good as Half Life 2? No, it isn't nearly as good. At the same time, though, Duke Nukem 3D isn't way more amazing than Doom 2 or Marathon or Quake or System Shock. All Duke Nukem 3D ever was was an interactive mid 90's action movie. Duke Nukem Forever is the exact same thing, except this one wasn't released in regular theaters and only got distributed through Grindhouse because there's quite a few♥♥♥♥♥♥here.I give Duke Nukem 3D 7.5 out of 10 and DNF 7 out of ten. Fight me, nerds.			",206,13,0,13,12,0,26

												Duke Nukem Forever is often referred to as DNF. In racing DNF means ""did not finish"" which is fitting because I didn't finish and neither did the devs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

DNF was one of the most anticipated games of all time...Slaughtered by over-hyping.Is DNF a bad game ? No. No it is not.Is it what we all wanted to be ? No. No it is not.Gearbox lied about many things. They promised us a campaign that is 12-16h long...I managed to beat the game in 9-10h in the HARDEST difficulty setting. So let's start this off by listing some of the biggest cons:-The old Duke is hardly ""back"". The one-liners are all good but there's few of them...Just put on repeat.-The levels are all rather linear not ""sandboxy"". It's basically a corridor shooter.-Regenerating health. What were they thinking?!?! That old-school Duke fans from the 90's really want that ? Yea...Logic!-2 gun limit. Later patched-raised the limit to 4.Basically no ammo, armor, health pickups to look for because of the regening hp. Ammo is thrown at you in boss fights so no need to be careful with ammunition anyways...I guess this also explains the linear level design. It all comes down to this: Lazy work! I blame Gearbox for being lazy and doing just a quick moneygrab on a known and over-hyped franchise/character! The game is simplified. You don't really need to think or be extra careful like in the original Duke Nukem 3D. The game's still fun tho. Most people who say it's the worse game ever or the worse game of 2011...Those people are full of shait!The game itself runs very well. I didn't encounter any glitches, bugs or crashes during my 15 hours of playing. It can hardly be THE worse game of the year if it's not even broken, right ? I mean...There's so many broken pieces of s***y ""games"" out there!The game runs well and can be fun! Duke is still Duke and the one-liners take you to a nostalgic trip. Boosting this game up is a joy! All the iconic guns are there and they are and feel amazing! Yes, the game is linear. Yes, you do have health regen and yes, you can only carry 4 guns at once...But as a fan of fun and Duke...I don't really care 'cus the game is still A LOT of fun.Most people who hate on it are just dissapointed because they hyped it up so much. Actually if the game would have sandbox areas, no weapon limit and ammo/hp pick-ups, people would still be mad and dissapointed. The game was hyped to a point where Gods themselves wouldn't dare to release it.Imagine gunning through a bunch of aliens while listening to the badass one-liners. Your Devastator runs out of ammo so  you change to your trusty shotgun and keep going...Sounds good ? That's what this game is all about. Duke is still badass and still sounds like one aswell.It's not a bad game but it's an over-hyped game. Ignorant people are just too blind to see it. There's a difference between DISSAPOINTMENT and a FAILURE. Sure the game was dissapointing but it's hardly a bad game because of it.			",707,129,45,70,35,10,64

												I'm going to get downvoted to hell, and i'm glad.I like this game. It's exactly what Duke Nukem Forever was going to be, being released when it was.Let me elaborate.Duke Nukem was always both an FPS and a meme-ridden parody. Most of the well beloved humor and quotes from D3D were quotes and references to pop culture back then, just like most of humor in DNF is quotes and references to pop culture of today (including Video Game cliches). The difference being that over time, the public opinion on such practice has shifted greatly. Mostly because now a good chunk of pop culture is related to the internet, and the internet is either very defensive or radically hateful of their ""culture"".As for gameplay.Duke 3D was born in the era of such games as Doom and Quake. And the gameplay REFLECTED this.D.N.F. was released in the era of more ""cinematic"" shooters with less focus on pure running and shooting, and more focus on interaction and ""Press X to do something awesome"" prompts. And the gameplay REFLECTS this.I'm convinced that if DNF was released at any other time period, it would have looked differently. It could resemble Half Life 2, or the first Half-Life. Nevertheless it would still be peppered with pop culture references relevant to the time periods of when these games were popular.I suspect that what people wanted and expected was Duke Nukem 3D but with modern graphics, and i wouldn't mind that either, i'm with you on this one.However if i'm right about Duke Nukem games being parodies of the games popular AT THE TIME of the game's release, then this is exactly what we were supposed to get. And personally, i love it.			",238,71,17,37,23,2,25

												I wanted to like Duke Nukem Forever. I really did.When early reviews criticized the game for poor graphics, crude/outdated humour, dumb AI, and linear levels, I gave the game the benefit of the doubt and hoped that the bad reviews stemmed from unrealistic expectations - expectations that were inflated to reflect the 10+ years that the game was supposedly in development for. Having spent many, many hours with DNF, I regret to say that the game is indeed a disappointment. It isn't all bad. Aside from inexplicably playing too much like a Halo/COD clone for my liking, I find the game's biggest issue to be the technical problems that have put me in a position to constantly replay the beginning of vehicle-based levels because something about those levels significantly ramps up the extent to which the game locks up/freezes on my computer.Here is an analysis of the major factors that comprise this game:PLOT: There is a plot, but it's pretty weak and uninspired. If anything, it gets in the way of the action that this game revolves around since there are instances where you're foreced to wait for NPCs who are blocking your path to stop talking until you can proceed to your next objective. Listening to these NPCs should be optional!GRAPHICS: For the most part, they look fine for what they are. Duke Forever never aspired to be the graphical successor to Crysis, so it's silly to compare it to such graphically astounding titles. Although the enemies look cool and much more menacing than they did in Duke Nukem 3D, some of the backgrounds seem very bland (i.e. Duke's Hotel) or feature details that stand out as very, very pixelated (i.e. Sunshine reflecting off of the wall of a large barn in the 'Ghost Town' map). The game looks a little too dark and gritty for my liking.SOUND: The reworked theme song notwithstanding, the game's music is nothing to write home about. The sound effects, on the other hand, are very well done. Jon St. John's voice acting for Duke is superb; it lends the game personality and makes me laugh because it is just as buffoonishly over the top and anachronistic as it was when Duke first started speaking in 1996.Critics who whine about how dated Duke Nukem comes across in DNF need to get their heads checked. Telling anonymous women to ""Shake it, baby!"" wasn't politically correct in the mid- to late-90s, but most of those who condemn Duke for continuning to objectify women in a similar fashion in 2011 incorrectly imply that his behaviour was excusable in D3D because it was in-line with the times. It wasn't. Duke was - and remains - a parodic embodiment of sex, drugs, violence, and machismo taken to absurd extremes.My favourite element of Duke Nukem Forever is the re-worked Holoduke accessory. Whereas it was conceptually cool but not very practical in Duke Nukem 3D, using it in DNF cloaks you in a Predator-style skin and produces a holographic replica of Duke that messes up his catchphrases. These botched lines ALWAYS crack me up! An added bonus is that the holographic image of Duke is now genuinely distracting to human foes: it moves around and appears to shoot like an actual multiplayer opponent would.GAME DESIGN: Sadly, DNF's maps are super linear. Whereas levels in D3D could be navigated a multitude of ways and were chock-full of secrets that encouraged and rewarded exploration and taking chances, navigation in Duke Nukem Forever can usually be summed up like this: move into a corridor; defeat all of its enemies; move into the next corridor. Rinse and repeat.One of Duke 3D's very best levels - Hollywood Holocaust - was recycled into DNF as a multiplayer-only map. The redone map gives away all of original's secret areas; you literally need do little more than walk or fly around to discover virtually every inch of this map. Now there are no switches to trigger, no walls to blow up, and practically no skill is involved to see everything there is to see. This remade level is a microcosmic representation of what what you get when you compare the spirit of D3D's level design to that of DNF's.The game's shooting mechanics are solid, but the weapon, ammunition, and health systems they are closely linked to really detract from my enjoyment of the game. Because the game arbitrarily imposes a low weapon limit, most enemies will become sources of ammo or new weapons once they're slain. Players feel no incentive to fight carefully, conserve ammo, or seek it out in hidden places, because they're practically guaranteed to have an ample arsenal whenever the dust of a skirmish settles. The health system is even worse; Duke's health regenerates over time. You can be completely careless about the way you fight and have the confidence of knowing that you'll come out with 100% health so long as you're patient enough to wait a few seconds before advancing to take on the next batch of enemies.To the credit of DNF's developers, they found a creative way of excusing the shift from a traditional health system to one aping that of Halo/COD: It's not Duke's health that gets hurt in battle, but rather, his ego. So long as Duke's over-confident, over-inflated sense of self worth remains above a set threshold, he keeps on going. He doesn't need to pick up health packs; he just needs a few seconds to clear whatever abuse he just withstood from his mind to feel as good as new. I don't like this new system, but I like the logic that went into implementing it into Duke Nukem Forever.CONTROL: For the most part, the game controls fine. I really only have two gripes about it. First, in-game VoIP Chat is spotty. Whereas I can count on Left 4 Dead to always broadcast my voice when I'm wearing a headset and I have the game configured to read any input from it, I have had mixed results getting others to hear me in DNF. On a more serious note, I recently gave up on playing the game because of a long-standing conflict between some of 2K's titles and Steam: a bug triggered by the Steam Overlay prohibits you from moving around. I have spent considerable time trying to un-do this bug, and have given up - mainly because I have already spent tons and tons of time struggling with a problem that has plagued me since I first started playing the game: Intermittent freezing.TECHNICAL QUALITY: DNF freezes on me. A LOT. Every time it freezes, the game's window locks up, the sound stutters, and I have to manually launch the task bar and force DNF to abort its operations for my system to be useful again. The freezing symptoms seem to happen at random, but occur a HELL of a lot more frequently when I have to get around by monster truck rather than on foot. Because players are forced to spend the first half of ""Ghost Town"" zooming around in a truck, I spent way more time loading, aborting, and restarting that section of the game than I would like to admit. It would almost always freeze within 3 seconds of playing the stage, and fiddling with the game's graphical and sound options didn't make a damned bit of difference in terms of reducing the problem. My computer's hardware is  more than capable of handling DNF on max settings, yet no game I've attempted to play has handled anywhere as poorly as DNF. My drivers are all up to date. I've tried compatibility modes. I even reluctantly made the switch from Windows 7 to Windows 8, yet not even that resolved the freezing issue.CONCLUSION: Duke Nukem Forever is not a great game in its own right, but I still enjoyed it enough to want to reach its climax. However, the crippling bugs I outlined not only soured my impression of the game, but convinced me to never, ever spend money on another PC port by publisher 2K Games (The freezing bug also affects Bioshock).QUICK RECAP: Mostly good graphics. Superb sound. Mediocre music. Lame level design. Servicable plot. Decent AI. Tarnished by regenerating health and low weapon limits. Crippling bugs. Skip it unless you are a die-hard Duke Nukem fan.			",108,11,2,1,4,1,0

												Duke Nukem Forever got a lot of negative press when it was released. Some was deserved, some was not. At the end of the day, it's not a masterpiece at any stretch, but it is enjoyable for what it is. If you can look past all of the games small problems, then there is a fun time to be had.Full video review:

												Duke Nukem Forever. 15 years in the making and yet here I am, considering if it couldn't have used a couple of more years in development. The truth is though, 5-10-15-20 years it wouldn't have mattered. The problem here isn't lack of development, it's the direction of the development.All the fluff is there though. Playing this game you will never doubt that this is a Duke game. Scantily clad women are everywhere and you will rarely walk more than ten feet between the various pop culture references, jokes and other nonsense. If anything Gearbox deserves some credit for getting that part of the franchise right. The humor is there, the silliness, the crazy. What they got wrong, is the mechanics.Playing Duke Nukem Forever is like playing every FPS made in the last 10 years. Gearbox certainly did. They added every cheesy feature the genre has ever experimented with. You got your vehicle sections, your turret sections, your button mashing quick-time events and so on and so forth. Any sense of the fast paced, old school style of FPS that made Duke Nukem 3D the icon it is today is long gone. Instead we have a Duke that's become old and arthritic. This Duke isn't the badass Duke of old. This Duke leans on stamina bars, regenerating health, limited weapon slots, scripted events and linear maps.Instead of the sprawling maps of Duke 3D, that had you running, jumping, flying and swimming all over the place, looking for secrets and keycards you play through entirely linear and fully scripted sequences and fights you do not allow you to progress until you've killed what the game wants you to kill and listened to whatever irrelevant dialog the game wants you to listen to. The entire experience is slow and dull and there is little to look forward to besides the naked ladies and the occasional proper joke.Duke Nukem 3D was a masterpiece of adolescent insanity, of old school fast paced shooting, of innovative map design. Duke Nukem Forever has captured the adolescent part but lost everything else in the shuffle. What's left is a mediocre shooter with a bunch of nudes thrown around.Duke Nukem Forever is not a very good game. It's a game that doesn't stay true to it's old school roots doesn't even compare to the original. Even by modern standards it brings nothing new to the table, just a bunch of rehashed concepts and ideas. Nothing is new, nothing is better than what's been already done.All in all. For those that have been waiting, hoping for a good old school style shooter, this ain't it. And for those that just want a decent modern shooter to pass the time, this ain't it either. They might get the crude humor right but everything else, just ain't Duke.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												Like a hyper-violent, over-sexed Peter Pan, Duke Nukem refuses to grow up. Though 12 years have passed since the events of Duke Nukem 3D, he's the exact same trash-talking, cigar-chomping, muscle-bound man of action, still rocking that '90s-style buzz cut and red tanktop. The source of his superhuman action-hero powers is his own ego, which doubles as a literal recharging shield over his (also recharging) health. It's reinforced by an entire world of people who worship him as an infallible man-god and sex idol—women want him, men want to be him. He's the stereotypical teenage boy's power fantasy personified and turned up to 11. Sure, he's a ham-fisted action hero parody, but Duke remains one of the most memorable characters in gaming history for a reason: he's simply more fun to play as than SERIOUS FACE ARMY MAN.As two-dimensional as Duke himself, the story gets right to the point: intergalactic sex-criminal aliens are re-offending, and Duke must defy orders and step in to defend Earth's chicks. Even that flimsy B-movie tribute plot is resolved (sort of) half way through—DNF becomes simply about shooting aliens 'cause they're ugly, and bits of the script are little more than profane Mad Libs. Lazy writing or pointed critique of the state of story in first-person shooters? I prefer to think of it as the latter.Action-wise, the single-player game fulfills its obligations as a successor to Duke Nukem 3D. It's fast-paced run-and-gun battle against diverse, love-to-hate 'em monsters, using weaponry ranging from conventional boomsticks toover-the-top sci-fi, and fought through a long series of corridor levels where there's almost always something unique to see and interact with. Almost every original weapon (except Duke's boot) returns—and after taking the Shrink Ray and Freeze Beam for a spin, it makes me wonder why few shooters have appropriated the joy of killing enemies in two-step attacks. Sure, shrinking enemies and then squashing them or freezing and shattering isn't as efficient as double-tapping to the head, but it's more fun. There's also the Devastator, a ridiculously powerful, double-barreled, rapid-fire rocket launcher that never pauses to reload until it's spent.Duke's trusty pistol, shotgun, Ripper chaingun, and rocket launcher may not be anything particularly unique or special (and certainly not realistic, lacking even a hint of recoil) but they're loud and potent alien killers. The new weapons, a rail gun sniper rifle, an alien laser, and a triple-missile-launcher called the Enforcer Gun are pretty ho-hum—no new classics here. The biggest sadness is that DNF has adopted the Halo-style two-weapon system, which frequently forced me to abandon my beloved Shrink Ray for lack of ammo. Even with all of that heavy weaponry, I still died quite a bit—despite the regenerating health system, Duke Nukem Forever is one of the more challen­ging shooters I've played in years.At least the signature remote-detonating pipe bombs, laser tripwire mines, and Holo-Duke decoys (plus melee-enhancing steroids and pain-mitigating beer powerups) exist outside this limitation, allowing you to set all manner of devious traps in the diverse range of linear, corridor-style levels and lure enemies into them. Duke battles the aliens through his high-tech Duke Cave, his self-styled opulent casino, the aliens' disgustingly organic hive (complete with Prey-style sphincter doors that open when tickled), a Vegas skyscraper, a Dukeburger restaurant, Hoover Dam, construction sites, Nevada canyons, underwater, and more.The old-style design is probably due to the fact that DNF should've come out years ago. (Hell, 2K's recommended PC is built from five-year-old hardware.) Here and there, it shows; while alien monsters look pretty cool—particularly the iconic Pig Cops and flying, tentacled Octabrains—humans and many of the environments look well behind the curve. But thanks to the aliens' comical massacre of EDF (Earth Defense Force) troops, you don't spend a lot of time looking at people, so it only really offends when the incompetent President waves his unarticulated fingers in your face.Pop culture references are similarly out-of-date—even growing moldy. Considering that the freshest ones I caught date back all the way to 2004's Team America: World Police (excluding reenactment of Christian Bale's 2009 meltdown in the opening and a crack at Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare tacked on at the end), most of Duke's one-liners were probably recorded in the early half of last decade. Though Duke still delivers several chuckles per level by quoting '90s films like Pulp Fiction and Starship Troopers and jabbing at Halo, it's noticeable that he's been living under a rock for quite some time.The most innovative puzzle gimmick is shrinking Duke down to a few inches tall and sending you scurrying through levels made for man-sized play. Being action-figure sized gives you a new and interesting perspective on the world—jumping around a vast kitchen battling rats and mini Pig Cops among the shelves while using mustard jars as cover is a very different experience, and one encounter in particular makes an epic battle of what would normally be a one-shot kill. However, running any significant distance on tiny legs can get tedious.Action is also varied up with frequent turret-shooting scenes, most of which are thankfully short and punchy, and two separate driving sequences: one as mini-Duke in an RC car, one in an oversized monster truck. Both are longer than they probably should be, as the uncharacteristic lack of guns on Duke's cars limits you to repeatedly running over enemies and turbo-boosting over jump after jump.One category in which DNF has surpassed its predecessor by leaps and bounds is in its uncensored nudity, particularly in the first half. Breasts abound, some attached to shapely but dead-eyed ladies, some to other, less appealing things. If that kind of thing bothers you, you've probably already been warned away by the long-as-your-arm ESRB rap sheet—but my personal taste threshold was exceeded only once, by a mid-game incident that goes just a little too far in mixing boobs, comedy, and gore.Other points of pain are the checkpoint-only save system, which is at least courteous enough to only rarely respawn me farther from the point of death than I'd have liked, and mercifully brief quick-time events—mostly just tapping Space bar for feats of strength.DNF is a throwback to the age when shooters were long single-player experiences first and multiplayer games second, and as such the eight-player multiplayer modes aren't going to challenge Call of Duty or Battlefield for the competitive crown. It's often hilariously effective at showing us a good time, though—the 10 maps, which are diversely designed with the same wide range of locations as the campaign, are built to create goofy and memorable moments when combined with Duke's weapons. It's a healthy chunk of game, too. The Steam clock read “10 hours played” when I'd finished the single-player run on normal difficulty, and that's without devoting time to posting a high score on the pinball machine or conducting a thorough search for secrets. Completing the game unlocks classic, why-doesn't-anyone-do-this-anymore cheats like character head scaling, and I might have to replay at least part of it just to see that absurdity in action.I'm sure that years of anticipation will spoil Duke Nukem Forever for some—there's no getting around that at the end of that long road is only a good game and not an amazing one. It is what it is. He may not be at the top of his game, but even after all this time, Duke still knows how to party.Recommended Despite All The Hate It Gets ",1534,600,45,244,159,15,219

												Duke Nukem is the friend you had in high school that you thought was really funny.  He was able to be a class clown, always had girlfriends, and was well loved by everyone who knew him.  You have not seen your old friend Duke for a while now, and the high school reunion is coming up.  You decide to go, and see some of your other old friends.  Some of them look really great.  Their awkwardness of their teens have changed into something really great.  As you converse with your old friends, catching up and feeling nostalgic, a familiar voice rings through the room.  You turn to see dear old Duke.  Duke, now having been aged by several years, does not look good.  He definitely has been though a rough patch.  You make conversation with him, and he consistently makes jokes reminiscent of your days in the geometry class you both took together.  You, now a mature adult, find the fecal, urine, and sex jokes not that funny.  The night has become awkward after seeing how Duke has not grown up, and probably never will.			",100,26,0,13,16,1,12

												Duke Nukem Forever is a game that was in development hell for nearly 15 years. During that time it managed to become what one could describe to be, the most hyped game of all time.Now, of course no game can sustain 15 years of hype and still manage to be successful in the eyes of it's community right? Well, when DNF was released in the early summer of 2011 it was probably one of the most hated games i've ever seen released.The game had some serious issues. It didn't feel like Duke Nukem 3D, it was slower, it had a 2 weapon limit, the graphics were rather poor and reminded me of something you'd have seen prior to DOOM 3, the bosses were lame bulletsponges and contained qte's and so on.Yet still i happen to like this game.""Why?"" you might ask, the reason is simple. It's Duke.No matter how poor this game is compared to Duke Nukem 3D, no matter how much better it could have been. It's still a thing, and i think that is the most important part about DNF. The game is just so overly happy to exist that sometimes you might actually forget about it's flaws, and just go on bursting the Alien skulls with your mighty boot.Besides, when you take a look at the rest of the shooters released in 2011 and compare DNF to them. I'd play this one over any of them ten times over.			",707,83,10,93,25,5,85

												This game has, in my opinion, received a lot of unfair flack - many people expected it to be something life-changing like Duke 3D, and that was never going to happen.Yes, it has some problems. Some of the sections are quite painful, and on higher difficulties the battles can be frustrating. However, it mixes everything up nicely and does a decent job of keeping things fresh. There is still some variety in this game, after all. Added to which, there are sections which are genuinely hilarious.It isn't the best game, or FPS, you'll ever play, but it is worth a go. If you enjoyed the base game, I would also suggest getting the DLC - The Doctor Who Cloned Me. Worthy addition to an enjoyable experience.P.S. Captain Dylan is a classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's normal to have high expectations on a game that's been in development for more than 10 years, but to judge it it's important to know a little of its development history to understand why they took so long to finish it.It was remade from scratch many times because of the engine or graphics being outdated, they wanted it to be perfect, or at least as groundbreaking as the original Duke Nukem 3D was at its time. Due to this fact, many of the original ideas planned for the game didn't make it to the final product as can be seen in its many trailers.But then, when all hope was lost (with 3D Realms closing) Gearbox appeared and saved the day buying the Duke Nukem license. And then the game was released. Was it groundbreaking? No. Was it awesome? I wish... Was it bad? No, and that's what it's important.If you don't know the history of its development, the final product (at least the bulk of it, not counting the makeup and multiplayer Gearbox added later) was finished by 2009, and due to budget and legal problems, the game felt a little old even for that time. So probably most of its ideas were nice and new for 2005 maybe, its not bad! But not as impactating as they wish they were (if they decided to change it, it probably would have never been released).Plot wise, it isn't something jaw dropping, it is something you would expect from a Duke Nukem game: Duke is loved and desired by the women, men admire him, and kids want to be like him, it's all going well until an alien mothership comes to Earth. The problem is, they're not being hostile... yet. As the story unfolds (doesn't take too long actually) everybody finds out that the aliens plan on abducting the women, and kill everyone else, ESPECIALLY Duke Nukem, so it's up to the King to go rescue the babes and save the world once again.Graphically, it isn't outstanding by any means, but Gearbox did a really good job poilishing it, the blur and depth of filed effects are really well implemented. You can notice a few low res texture here and there (most noticeable on the console versions) but it shines at times like in the Cycloid Emperor fight at the start of the game or in the Mothership battle a bit alter on. What really is kinda of ugly, it's the animations, the characters move unnaturally and don't have many facial expressions, reminded of Quake 4 NPCs. On the other hand, the enemies are very detailed and in general really well done.In the Sound department, it lacks a more compelling soundtrack, but the voice acting is really well done, Jon St. John returns as Duke doing a really great job. The other NPCs sound a little ridiculous sometimes, but that's intended. The one-liners return and (fortunately for me and unfortunately for others) the old ones come back too. There aren't many good ones within the introduced in this game, but some really have the spirit of the franchise.Gameplay was one of the most controversial things about this game, I thought it was too linear run and gun with regenerative health (ego) as most FPS games are nowadays, and that's what disappointed me. Don't get me wrong, it's fun to play, but I expected it to be more open ended like Duke 3D. I was hoping for something that would really differ (in a good way) from all the games we have today. There are puzzles here and there and I enjoyed them, to reduce the pace a little to not get too repetitive. The other games references were funny and not offensive like most people think they were, Duke Nukem 3D featured a ""dead space marine.."" (Duke's voice) and played just like it, guys at Id found it hilarious and not offensive, it's more of a homage than an offense. The guns for the most part don't feel very powerful (with the exception of the shotgun), and the classic funny ones can't be used as they were in Duke 3D because of the 2 weapon limit (4 as an option with a later released patch), the Shrink Ray is overpowered, since it's almost One Shot One Kill, but the Freeze-Ray is underpowered because it takes a lot of time to actually freeze the enemy and puts you in harm's way since it only works in close range.The loading times aren't as huge on the PC as they are on the console versions, but it is still a little big when you are dying constantly in a specific part of the game. You can't save whenever you want, instead the game uses checkpoints, which actually makes the game more challenging (too much at times but oh well).Multiplayer is old school. Features deathmatch, team deathmatch, CTF (CT Babe in this case), and King of The Hill. All old school fast paced, not many people play it, but its fun for a while. Weird that when any player dies, they blow up instead of having ragdolls, probably because the guys at Gearbox didn't have time to implement it.As a game released these days, I'll give it a 6, which is fair, it shares a lot of similarities to other popular FPS games these days (including the complaints). But knowing that it was supposed to be released a long time ago (talking of the actual build, not the old ones), when the ideas were actually ""new"" for the time, I would give it a 7.8. I think that after all that the developers been through, they deserve a little understanding.			",236,35,2,25,9,1,28

												Duke 3D + Plutonium Pack is way better than this consolefied crap, this is what you would call a pile of bad decisions. I recommend turning off post effects and motion blur, ""expanding inventory"" in the game settings menu, and changing default mouse sensitivity (see instructions below). You may want to change key bindings because the default is not even practical.pros: humor, visuals, half-life inspired sets, and other video game referencescons: quick time events, clunky controls, graphically inefficient, buggy, generic turret sections, bad map designs (all the maps are linear and there are redundant map sections), you can barely carry any weapons (4 maximum) and ammo capacity is too little (RPG only has FIVE ammo, WTF!?!?), ending sucked, and the game overall is basically dumbed downThis is not a worthy DN sequel and not worth more than $5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a weird feeling to it, as if a classic PC shooter had a one night stand with a post-Halo console FPS and this popped out 9 months later.  Gameplay identity crisis aside, it's quite fun and still very much Duke.			",81,5,0,5,4,3,14

												Not great but not terrible like many others have said. At least the load times are only a few seconds on PC compared to almost a minute on console. 5.5/10			",328,20,8,2,6,1,0
