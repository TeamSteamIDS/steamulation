												Half Life is a game that shocked the gaming industry back in 1998. It might've not been the first of its kind, but it was certainly one of the best. The graphics, inferior compared to today's photorealistic games, were still amazing when it came out. You play as Doctor Gordon Freeman, a scientist working for the mysterious Black Mesa corporation. After discovering an alien planet known as Xen, several experiments are conducted to bring back specimens from this new world. As you come to work one day, everything is normal- except for a test involving a teleportation to Xen, and a suspicious man in a suit warning about unforseen consequences. The team ignores this, and it would cost them nearly everything. The experiment fails, and all hell breaks loose as Xen creatures teleport into the Black Mesa facility, killing anyone and anything. You wake up, during the aftermath of this event. Determined to escape, you fight your way through the facility, all the way to Xen. To find out the rest, you have to play the game. And believe me, every single second of this game is worth it.Graphics: 19/20Story: 18/20Gameplay: 20/20Replayability: 18/20Soundtrack: 18/20Overall: 93/100, Grade A			",215,36,1,22,26,3,25

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE 1: Related ContentAlso see my:Half-Life 2 ReviewHalf-Life: Opposing Force ReviewHalf-Life: Blue Shift ReviewBlack Mesa ReviewNOTE 2:I review games to help fellow gamers decide whether they should purchase a game or not.  With that said, although I consider Half-Life as a classical MASTERPIECE and possibly one of the greatest games of all time, I will still list down game mechanics from the past that some people may not enjoy today.Think of it like this: everyone enjoys flying modern-day commercial jets like the 747, but it doesn't mean however that everyone would like to fly in a DC-3 built in the 1940s despite it being labeled as the 'most significant transport aircraft' in history.INTRODUCTION:Half-Life is a narrative-driven linear first-person shooter (FPS) action game and is the debut (and signature) title of Valve.  Hailed as one of the greatest games of all time winning dozens of awards on release, Half-Life revolutionized the FPS genre in a way that no other title has done since Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake. This game has since been the industry standard on how to make a perfect FPS game which combines realistic gameplay, fun puzzles mechanics, a narrative-driven single-player experience with fast-paced multiplayer action.The game follows the story of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist working for the Black Mesa Research Facility that is involved in Weapons Development, Research on Teleportation Technology and occasional cloning of a Security Guard named Barney Calhoun.  When an experiment with an unknown alien crystal results in a catastrophic accident that opened a portal to an alien dimension named 'Xen', Gordon Freeman, wearing the H.E.V. Suit, must now travel across the entire Black Mesa facility to reach the Lambda Complex where he must enter a portal to Xen and kill the creature that is keeping the portal open for the alien invaders. Fight against Invading alien monsters and, at the same time, US Military operatives who are attempting to stop the invasion but is also trying to silence any surviving 'witnesses' of the Black Mesa incident.LEGACY OF HALF-LIFE (PROS):+ First FPS game to fully incorporate a Narrative-Driven story (as opposed to the industry standard of maze gallery shooters which was the Wolfenstein 3D / Doom mechanic)+ Excellent level designs+ Realistic combat mechanics (may be not as realistic now in 2015, but 17 years ago it was)+ Fun puzzles+ Great sound effects+ First FPS game to incorporate scripted sequences for its level transitions rather than cut-scenes+ Relatively advanced AI (back in 1998), with enemies actively dodging, tactically retreating and often times baiting you into an ambush.+ Fun fast-paced multiplayer action that set the foundations for Counter-Strike which started as a mere mod of Half-Life+ Mods; although Half-Life is not the first video game to be modded, it is the first to have several such mods become their own full games that still retain their Half-Life heritage+ Challenging difficulty modes (but this is a given since most old-school shooters were challenging)OLD GAME MECHANICS THAT NEW GENERATION OF GAMERS MAY NOT LIKE (CONS):- Perpetual sprint with optional walking by pressing “Shift” (as opposed to today's standard which is the reverse)- No objective tracker (players may forget what they were doing especially if they haven't played in a while)- Melee weapon needs to be equipped rather than bound to a hotkey (though CS:GO players won't have a problem with this)CONCLUSION:MASTERPIECE is the only word that best describes Half-Life in my opinion.  Although some of its mechanics may not necessarily be applicable in today's (2015) standard, the same can still be considered as part of its charm, much like how most of us still enjoy watching old-school movies and TV shows.WORTH IT?:MUST BUY AND MUST HAVE. I, however, do recommend you purchase the Half-Life Anthology if you already have Half-Life 2 but if you don't have it, get Half-Life Complete.ADDITIONAL INFO (Not necessary for the review):The advent of Half-Life was a turning point in gaming history, most notably, the First-person shooter genre.  Before this game, the only FPS standard to be followed was Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake, with the first two being plotless maze shooters and Quake being the first to implement a backstory but still retained the maze-like levels. With Half-Life, developers saw a potential for FPS games to combine intense action and gunplay with effective narrative story-telling through leniar levels (which is heavily abused by some FPS games today) and realistic game mechanics (a title, which most people agree, was held by the Metal Gear Solid franchise, a third-person action game)Let’s put this in an analogy: Wolfenstein 3D is the Wheel (basically invented the mainstream FPS genre), Doom is the Horse-Drawn Carriage (Doom made FPS games extremely popular, accessible and widespread), Quake is the Steam Engine (Quake bridge the gap between plotless maze shooters and  plot driven FPS games Credit: Steam User RGX12 for pointing this out) and Half-Life is the Ford Model T Car (Half-Life set the standard for modern day FPS games who's basic and essential features still survives today.)--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												What's the first thing that comes to mind, when reviewing a video game? Well, for me, it has to be the visual world that captures the core of our imaginations. And with this little gem called Half-Life, it comes as no exception that this game continues to boggle the mind and leave gamers alike wondering. There is more heart, creativity and scientific ingenuity there is in this one title than there is in most series and is arguably Valve's greatest achievement. With over 50 game awards, it's a strong justification. Half-Life isn't just one of the greatest FPS' games of all time. Half-Life isn't literally one of the best purchases you can ever get on Steam. Half-Life is quite simply, one of the greatest games ever made.When compared to certain FPS' games in the past and todays time, which both heavily rely on long-winded cutscenes to present the main narrative of the game, Half-Life annihilates this often compulsed aspect, by detailing the plotlines that keeps the player still in control of the first-person viewpoint, leaving the cutscenes rolling while you still have full access to the gameplay and character controllability. For summarization, You will see through the eyes of Gordon Freeman at all times.The game is a perpetual maze; leaving the player to work at tasks that involve being locked into battle and overall puzzle solving to advance through the many challenges that wait up ahead. Most of the time, the story illuminates the puzzles by the actions to proceed, such as maze scenarios and building boxes to use as staircases. Although Half-Life has short-lived loading screens from time to time after leaving a certain area for a new one, the game has no levels. But, to make up for this traditional concept, the game is split into a number of mind-boggling chapters filled with rich story and easy adaptability.To start off with this game's story, you're none other than Gordon Freeman. A young man who holds a Ph.D in theoretical physics who starts his daily grind back at the Black Mesa Research Facility; a fictional complex that is stranded in a remote desert located in the suburbs of New Mexico. Arriving late for work yet again, you take the tram system around the Black Mesa Research Facility and at this point, objectives that his game has fulfilled such as breath-taking visuals and movie quality animation begins to blossom. The tram sequence at the beginning of the game can only be summed up in one word; Incredible. It's as if the things that come flying at you from every angle and position, almost reminiscent of watching an action-packed movie, along with the credits of the producer's names proudly fading in and out on the corner of the screen.As you make your first step in the heavily secured facility, you're constantly reminded that you put on your Hazardous Environmental suit, or the H.E.V suit for short. While all things are hunky-dory, those things soon turn to the worst very soon. After a failed experiment, involving a collision between a rare intergalactic specimen from another dimension with an Anti-Mass Spectrometer, the Black Mesa facility falls in ruins, meaning you are one of the only key survivors of the infamous ''Black Mesa Incident''. And with this, alien life-forms from the dimension of ''Xen'' are pulled from their dimension into ours and are running amok the ruined facility, along with the Army that storm the place after the gone, haywired facility's emergency call has been echoed. This of course doesn't make things any easier and you soon find yourself battling both the aliens and the military.While there isn't exactly much to complain about, I would admit that guiding the chickened-out scientists and professors around the facility can be quite a pain now and again due to some seldom poor AI programming, as well as the alien life-form, Vortigaunt, from which you would have to wait and be patient for them to wreck down wooden doors in front of you, as you are not capable of doing that yourself. (You do start off with a crowbar, right?) As well as I'm probably not the only one who made the same mistake by killing them through a small opening, before they did in fact begin to tear down the doors. But then again, this is where the used scripted intermissions started to show, so that's an added bonus to the magnitude of the game.For the long run, I've had fun and joy both reviewing this amazing game and playing this amazing game. If you haven't play Half-Life or even worse, not familiar with Half-Life, it's still a big compulsory  recommendation from me.			",111,8,0,6,5,1,3

												It's 1998 and you're playing a new game. You're riding in some type of a train through these bottomless dark halls filled with pipes, and windows with scientists, some robots and a strange guy in a blue suit. All this seems to be part of some huge underground complex.Suddenly this game interacts with you, telling you that you're late for some kind of experiment. This seems to be important so youre trying to get there. You get your HEV suit and venture deeper into Black Mesa. Something feels a miss as your noticing system errors and a computer explosion, not to mention that radioactive leak you saw while riding the train. But everyone keeps telling you that everything is properly fine. So you go ahead with the experiment and *BOOM* *CRASH*And now you're no longer that guy sitting in front of a computer playing some new video game. You're Gordon Freeman. A new employee of the Black Mesa Research Facility with a Ph.D in Theoretical Physics, who has now witnessed a resonance cascade, causing extraterristial beings to cross over from somewhere else. Now you most escape this terrible catastrophe!			",257,28,4,23,27,1,30

												Hi there, people. Today, I'm speaking about Half-Life, a Valve game which was first released in 1998 and had more than 50 rewards. By most players, this game was considered as a highly atmospheric, greatly built, and amazingly drawn. It also has awesome storyline and multiplayer, so if you don't care about graphics, which were brilliant in 1998, then this game is for you. Complexity of the game levels, hidden secrets, alternate paths, 5 categories of weapons (14 weapons in total), different kinds of friends and enemies will give you as much pleasure as if you got quite a rich man. In my opinion, Half-Life deserves all the rewards it was given, and will stay the best game I've ever played until the end of my days. That is it, and, at last, I want to say: if you are not sure if you should buy this game, you definitely should.They call me ""noob"". Have a nice day!			",94,11,1,8,8,1,1

												Do you have a PC? Do you have any interest in gaming? Then you should probably play Half-life. Half-life is one of those games that you kind of have to play before you die. It may not be the timeless masterpiece people make it out to be, but what you do get is a really lengthy game with a strong focus on singleplayer. And when you've finished the original game there's literally hundreds of mods to explore.Full video review:

												Half-Life is one of the most influential games and many of us have played our fair share of it's modifications like the original Counter-Strike and many more. It surely is an important game and many refer to it as the best game ever made, but Half-Life does have it's flaws as well. I'll start off with the positive. Most of the games at the time didn't have much depth in the story. Mainly you simply had to run and shoot and the story felt irrelevant, but in Half-Life it was different. The story is quite the usual - an experiment goes wrong and it creates a portal to another planet which allows hostile aliens to go through. Eventhough it seems nothing much, you can always feel that there's more depth put into the story. The pacing is perfect and the world you are playing in is still interesting to look at. The level design is amazing and it does hold up today, even if some of the levels may feel a bit too long. All of the weapons are unique and have use for them. All of them are useful in certain situations. There's also a big variety on how to defeat your enemy.The multi-player is still being played today and you'll be able to find servers, but I'd suggest looking up servers on internet, since there's a bigger choice. Multi-player is a fast-paced deathmatch which reaquires a lot of skill and patience. Concept is pretty simple, but actually getting good at it is hard. Maps are well designed and it's still a fun experience, but I'd suggest finishing the story first, because it's where the real beauty of the game is. So, there aren't many things to say about Half-Life's flaws. One of the biggest issues is that the soldiers will most likely hit you most of the time, because they are not designed to miss their shots as much. You have to kill them as fast as possible, just so you won't catch as many bullets. On the other hand, other enemies don't do this. Also the levels drag on too much sometimes. Some of the levels feel too long and it might be a little irritating if you are playing the first time. The levels where you have to jump on platforms aren't something I'd like to play through either, but hey, maybe you enjoy that. Overall, Half-Life still holds up today despite it's age and I can see why people, including me, still play it and it's mods today. If you can't decide whether you should pick Half-Life or Half-Life: Source, I'd say that you should definitely go for the original. The new gun models, textures etc. doesn't make the game feel balanced. It's like your stuck between an old and a new game. Also, Source version does not have as many mods, so go for the original.

												Pure Nostaglia!This game started it all. From the ""Hail Lord Gaben"" to ""Half Life 3 confirmed?"" to the memes about ""what would happen if Gordon Freeman would've talked"" to the countless fan-made movies, mods, art and so much more! This game put Valve on the map with a big star.You are scientist Gordon Freeman, working at the Black Mesa Research Facility (In our world consider it to be the science-fiction version of Area-51) where you are caught in a freaky lab accident that pratically descended the entire facility into not only a hell-hole but also a warzone. Work your way through the facility with the help of your fellow personal as you fight off these alien creatures from the borderworld of Xen, and also the Military Clean Up crew.The only slight errors this time around are, once again the mouse senstivity (adjust that to 1.0) and the Gamma (send that dial on to low) also note apply these to Blue Shift and Opposing Force (If you think it's best, however).the Mulitplayer servers are still active although it might be hard to get into some of them. But it shouldn't be a big deal.Other than that. If you want to play the game that started it all. Get. This. Game. I highly recommend it!			",95,27,0,34,11,4,25

												The FPS game. The game that defined a genre 15 years ago. Now with widescreen support, vsync option and hi-res texture pack! No, not HD texture pack, just high-res (released quite long ago so the game still looks dated).Why do we like Half Life? Because you play an average guy, a scientist, not some spec-ops sir-yes-sir veteran, just one of the common people who finds himself in the middle of a catastrophe and the only way to get out of it is to shoot up some aliens. Oh, and while there, why not go to their planet to blow up the very alien controlling all of them?I believe this was the game that gave birth to scripted events, or at least made them look very good.It is an action-packed, amazing game - with some puzzle sequences here and there - that offers roughly 10-15 hours of single player time, if not more. Nowadays, this is very rare.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-Half life.The game that started it all.Even though it was made back in 1998,it is still a gem.I don't vote games by their graphics,but by their gameplay.This was an immersing,wonderful and addicting experience for me.I lived another life.In this game.The game has everything a gamer asks for: Immersing Gameplay,Indulging story,A Nice Selection of Weapons,and graphics that were thrilling in the year it was made,but are all old now.Even now this title holds up till today,shining its glory as the first game that Valve ever made,and a game that changed Gaming itself.Now I will have a look at the main aspects of a good game.WARNING: A little bit of spoiling ahead.Gameplay: Excellent.Either you are blasting monsters from an alternate dimension or just trying to pick off those squad men who just don't seem to put you in peace.There were a few places where it did get a little bit boring,but that was because I couldn't wait until I would experience something new.The terrain in the game is nicely made,even though it is pretty old due to the date it was made.The places you travel through are pretty different,you won't be bored of seeing the same old place over and over again.The game itself is nicely balanced;except that they could have put less ammo in the game,so you wouldn't always have a gun loaded. 9/10Story: A nice story is told throughout the game,and that is guaranteed to keep you hooked until the last moment of the game.Even though it doesn't have any cutscenes,it tells its story just wonderfully.It keeps you in first person mode all of the time,so it makes you ""live"" the character all the way through the story.All the stuff that is happening in the game seems kind of logical,as if could happen in real life.The characters are well done as well,for they act as normal people would act.They are as they should be,they speak,fight,help you and do other stuff.And there is a wierdly acting character which stands out in the game;but I will let you figure that out for yourself.There aren't the same scientists all over and over again,but we can't say this with security guards.The enemies are widely assorted and won't make you think that they are dumb,but play as they are real and trying to get you.No dull moment will get you in this game,so don't be afraid of experiencing any in this game.  10/10Weapons: There is a wide assort of weapons to fit you in this game,but do not expect too much.There are the main weapons you would except from a game like this,and maybe a little bit more due to an ""Monster Invasion"" going on all around you.The game has its own signature weapon: A Crowbar.But that is also the only melee weapon that you can use in this game.While you progress through the game you will find weapons,but there aren't many,so every weapon you get,you make use of,because all of them are unique.As I won't spoil much here,I will just tell you that there are weapons from the pistol even to such weapons like a rocket launcher,and a few of alien techologies are found in the game as well.You will find yourself exploring all around you to get some ammo for your favourite weapon,because it gives you tons of ammo for a wide selection of weapons,and the ammo that you need may not be findable anywhere.When you shoot a gun it feels like you shoot a gun,meaning that you will find the gun bouncing back in your hand when you shoot it,and you can hear the sound for gun firing is well done as well.But when shooting a rocket launcher you will not bounce back,but if you move while shooting it the rocket will go wrong and hit another spot,depending on which way you moved.Even if you don't have any ammo,you get to use a alien techonlogy which has unlimited ammo.Even though it recharges over time,it doesn't take much of it and it has special abilities.  8.5/10Enemies: From the headcrab even to the final boss,the enemies are nicely balanced.You are slowly introduced to each enemy and its tactics,so you know what to use on it and what to do.You probably won't find yourself facing a unnormally big army of enemies if you aren't well armed.Once you learn the tactics the enemies use it is easy to defeat them,just keep a look out for them,or otherwise you might find yourself in quite a pickle.I wouldn't say that the enemies are hard.You can use the terrain to your advantage as well.Luckily,one group of your enemies is fighting another,so you can use that to your advantage as well,if you find the right moment.*wink*.But I wouldn't rely on such stuff,I would just get myself a nice arsenal of weapons and go defeat that crowd of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.There are a few weapons which have unlimited ammo,and I feel that is unbalanced.Don't go prancing around as a pony as well,you will get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked.There are flying enemies,crawling enemies,walking enemies and big enemies.The crawling ones are easy,just keep a look out for them so they don't get the jump on you.The Flying ones need the right weapons,like a zoom in crossbow,for they fly around and shoot at you and when you get close to them they just fly away.The walking ones are easy enough,just keep a shotgun on your hand and you will be OK.But the big ones need a plan,a strategy and a assault of weapons. 9.5/10Graphics: From Black Mesa labs to even Alien fields of doom,this game is amazing.It now has its own HD models,so a few things look better when the models are turned ""ON"".Any computer will be able to get this game running,so why not jump in it already?And as this game was made in 1998,don't expect modern graphics.But that couldn't stop you from playing this game,could it?The terrain is kind of blocky and the characters as well,but if you look past that point get ready to indulge into a game that made gaming as it is today.And the graphics aren't that bad,everything is quite understandable.They have made the graphics the best way they could,and I don't blame them because I don't vote a game by its graphics.And if you can't stand the graphics there is a Source version of the game,made by Valve as well.There is a version made by fans as well,but I wouldn't recommend that because it is modified a bit.But the original is the best in my opinion as it is the completly unmodified version of half life,and the best out there.Of course,that is if you look past the graphics.There are even little details specified in the originl game,but they won't be seen so good and will be kind of blurred.But be sure to keep your eyes lit,for there are many levers,buttons and things like that throughout the game,that blend in with the enviroment. 8.5/10Overall look: Even though this game is dated,it is definently not dead.Be sure to pick this game up on a sale,or even buy it at its full price,because this game is worth every cent you pay for it.I loved the game,it really got me pulled in and the story was just stunning.I loved every place I came upon to in this game,seeking new adventure and traveling on into the deep unknown.This game is filled with interesting moments and is guaranteed to keep you aroused until the very ending.This is a great classic and everyone should play it,it is an experience not to be missed.It changed gaming as it is now,and was a hit in gaming and it still is.A wonderful game.

												As someone old enough to remember the first-hand buzz over Half-Life in highschool, but never having played it until 15 years later, I'm very glad I ignored the voice telling me it'd have dated gameplay mechanics and be dated and weak by todays stanards because I was 100% wrong and enjoyed it from start to finish.I remember kids at school talking about how amazing the graphics were more than anything else and so I was scared that this was most of what the game had to offer, and by playing it in 2015+ it'd be just plain visually uninteresting, and that the physics engine Valve is so lauded for would be boring. I was completely wrong and while Half-Life certainly has fairly bland graphics and visual palettes by some standards, it's still artistically appeasing to look at, particularly in the intro but even the level designs and contrasts of later levels are striking at times and the physics engine is no longer impressive by todays standards, but strengthens the gameplay rather than being a dependent part of it.What all this means is that this game hasn't aged in terms of fun gameplay and has barely aged in terms of visual style and it still felt impressive to play through. I'm sad I didn't get a chance when it came out, but I haven't missed out and I'll be revisiting this game every few years to come.If you're one of the handful of people on the planet like me and visiting this game for the first time more than a decade and a half later- don't delay, the first play-through is every bit as fun, thrilling and impressive as it was on release.

HALF-LIFEThis might be my hardest review. It was rediculously hard to come up with a score of some kind. Half-Life was a revolutionary game, and shocked the world. It had the action of DOOM and an entirely open world of lore and story. It's based around the protagonist, Gordon Freeman, escaping the underground New-Mexican government base, Black Mesa, after it is attacked by aliens and hired assassins and marines.UNFORSEEN CONSEQUENCESOn reveal back in 1997, people were shown something that looked like Quake mixed with 007. Nobody had experimented with this forumla really, save for Goldeneye. At some point after reveal, Valve scrapped the entire game and built it entirely from scratch, changing both the story and characters. And believe it or not, Half-Life was released less than half a year later, shocking the world. Needless to say, I'm sure, Half-Life was met with critically oustanding reception, branded as possibly the best video game ever, rivalling the likes of Ocarina of Time. Who knows what the original game would've been like? All we can say is, we really did receive and absolutely staggeringly amazing and immersive first person shooter experience. Half-Life more or less ruined every other game like an AoE bomb.WE'VE GOT HOSTILESHalf-Life's combat system was met with overwhelming praise, running on a modded QUAKE engine, the shooting seemed absolutely seemless. The AI was also praised. The enemies seemed to always make accurate hits, which was a rare thing, and made the game surprisingly difficult. While it was criticized for the last few chapters (Xen) for seemingly transfering into a more platformer-style game, that did nothing to dampen the experience, and it was still amazingly enjoyable.DON'T FORGET ABOUT FREEMANMost people don't realise this fact. This was Valve's first game. It made their entire career, it brought us all here today. It elongated the PC community games like Quake had set. This might be the most important game of all time, and it deserves nothing but uttermost respect. More on the actual game, anyway. it consists of 18 chapters, which are 2-3 hours long each, that is absolutely phenominal for a 3D game released in 1997 under a 6 month developement.RATINGThis game brings a tear to the eye. It is without a doubt the single best first person shooter of all time, and went on to birth two equally important franchises, Team Fortress and Counter-Strike. It was rediculously hard to give a rating. Taking Xen as really the only possible complaint, this game rivals the likes of both Dark Souls and Ocarina of Time for the best game ever created. 9.9/10 ",128,8,1,20,10,0,3

												If you've never played a Half-Life game and aren't relatively familiar with the story and franchise, then this review might be for you. If you're just looking for a fresh perspective on one of your favorite classics then this review might also be for you. This was the first time I have ever played a Half-Life game. I'm afraid I missed it when it was released, however, I did play similar shooters from that era. I didn't think a review from me would be necessary for such a popular title like Half-Life but seeing that all of the top reviews for it are those ridiculous one or two sentence jokes, I thought that maybe my take on it would be welcome.In Half-Life, you fill the shoes of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who's getting ready for an ordinary day at the office. Gordon Freeman apparently, dons his fancy HEV suit every morning after punching in on the time clock, and then runs around in a room that is not safe anyone not wearing said suit.Long story short, something bad happens while on the job, and aliens decide to invade Gordon's workplace, Black Mesa labs. You then spend the rest of the game trying to get out of the now compromised Black Mesa facility. The structure is surprisingly large for a research lab and you'll spend quite some time traversing it's different levels, from labyrinthine industrial machinery to the sterile, clean laboratories where Freeman's colleagues go-a-sciencing. Without spoiling too much, the army becomes involved and for some unexplained reason, presumably a cover-up, considers you to be just as dangerous as the invading aliens.That pretty much covers it, as far as an overall picture is concerned. You won't start with much, as far as weapons are concerned, however you'll slowly build up your collection as you romp through Black Mesa. The gameplay is smooth and uncluttered with too many bells and whistles. You run, shoot, and jump your way to the surface of the facility. Sometimes, you'll even push and pull some things to solve some very mild puzzles. The game can be quite challenging if you up the difficulty enough. And ammo is at a premium. You really have to think about what weapons you're using against which enemies and what is the most efficient way to kill them. Some weapons are better for killing different targets, which is a nice thing that makes this game more than just a mindless shooter.There is little dialogue throughout this game. In fact, there are even a couple of levels where you won't encounter too terribly many enemies, however those are mostly reserved for the more industrial areas of Black Mesa.The game is definitely dated, as it runs on the old 1998 GldSrc engine. If you're itching to get your nostalgia on, this can be a good thing, though. It reminded me a lot of Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force from the early 2000's (unsurprisingly, as Raven Software admitted Half-Life was their inspiration for Elite Force). It can also be considered reminiscent of Doom, in it's tone, especially in the later levels I think. If you really just aren't in the mood of '98 graphics, thought, you could always get the Source version of the game, which isn't terribly different, but does give it that extra little oomph you may be looking for.All in all, there weren't many cons in this game for me, except for it's lack of exposition. I think that may be more of a sign of it's age, however. Like I said, there isn't much dialogue and if you're looking for a lot of story, you won't really find it in this game. However, I've been told that HL2 has more of that sort of thing. I also mentioned above that ammo can be hard to find and many might consider that to be another negative trait. That's just something that will come down to personal preference, though. At least I never found myself bored while playing. The end boss was pretty unforgiving, though. The technical difficulty of defeating the final boss was fairly frustrating and they didn't exactly make the mechanics of doing it very smooth. This also seems to be a relic from gaming's past, though.All things considered, I really enjoyed this game. I came it with mostly a fresh perspective, as I knew little about the tone of Half-Life and I knew little of the story. Even though I never played this as a kid, the nostalgia from shooters of it's era was enough to make me smile from time to time. If you played Quake III or games like it, you might also notice some of the minor similarities. When you consider that this was Valve's debut product, it makes it all seem that much more impressive.			",137,72,4,33,22,0,21

												You play the role of Gordon Freeman and arrive late for work at the Black Mesa research facility. As you are walking through the steel corridors to get down to the test chamber all the other scientists keep saying: ""They are waiting for you Gordon in the test chamber"". After 4 loading screens and alot of waiting on scientists to mock you for being late before letting you progress to the test chamber you at last arrive there to do some testing with crystals from the alien world Xen. However the test goes wrong the very second you push the Xen crystal mounted on a Lawn mower into a beam for testing. This creates the resonance cascade which creates a rift between earth and Xen, allowing Vortigaunts and other alien species to enter earth at will. The Black Mesa security cannot stop the aliens and the army is called in. The army is however not there to help the Black Mesa personnel. They are there to kill everybody invovled with the project.Gordon Freeman must now fight the aliens, fight the soldiers, try to save the scientists that mocked him for being late and with the help of the scientists reach Xen to stop Nihilanth(The Alien mastermind). Overall Half-Life is probably one of those games ive spent the most time playing. Outside of steam that is. Bought it back in 1999 and when steam came along my key was already taken steam said(To verify my key I had to take a photo of my product and its key and send it to valve and back in 2004 that was not an easy thing to do). So I had to play it outside of steam until it ended up on one of those sales. If you have steam and don't have Half-Life then I recomend you buying it as quickly as possible.Half-Life is also being remade by a team of dudes. The mod is called Black Mesa. Its avalible for download but it lacks the last levels that were sceduled to be released 2 years ago.I give Half-Life 10/10 for being a great game and having great replay value.

												The most Influential game of all time.  And it feels as new as it was on the day it ws released November, 8th, 1998 thanks to the HD textures. Also, has one the most revolutionary beginning sequences in gaming by telling a story not by B.S. cutscenes, but in the players perspective in real time.  Actually, it's like that throughtout the entire game.  Also has a great soundtrack. The characters are memorable, specifically the silent protagonist ""Dr. Gordon Freeman Ph.D"".  Along with that, Gordon is not one demensional, even though he doesn't talk he has a back story.Recommend it for all valve fans alike.There're also 2 other expansions that Gearbox software made called Opposing Force and Blue Shift if you want to check those out.

												It's an understatement to say I was somewhat late to the party when it comes to Half-Life. Valve's debut title was released back in 1998, and yet I only actually played the game last year in 2016. I wrote a review for it a little while after but I am not particularly happy with it, so here's the re-write of my Half-Life review. In Short - Half-Life currently and always will occupy the grand title of my favourite game ever. Although that title is shared with a few other games (Hotline Miami 2, Kid Icarus: Uprising, etc) the position is not very easy to get to. Although my reviews may not make it seem this way but I am extremely critical of video games, making it very hard to actually title a game my favourite. Yet there's something so painfully gripping about Half-Life. From story, to gameplay. Level design to even graphics, the game really masters the FPS genre, especially for its time. More In Depth - If you weren't aware - which is almost impossible - Half-Life follows the story of a scientist named Gordon Freeman. One day at work an experiment goes horribly wrong and a portal is opened to a dimension named Xen. Gordon then sets out on a 'quest' to escape the now broken facility, fighting both Xen aliens and a group of HECU soldiers who come to the facility to clean up any evidence of this incident. This story is further expanded in the game's expansions, Half-Life: Blue Shift and Half-Life: Opposing Force, and expanded further still in the sequel Half-Life 2. This story is conveyed completely without cutscenes. From the first moments to the last, every single part of the game you are in control of Freeman. You can also decide to kill whoever you like. Scientists and friendly guards are 100% killable and you can decide to either spare or destroy anybody who crosses your path. While it does not directly affect anything that happens in the game, it is still very interesting to have such control over what you do. Control taken out in many recent games. Freeman's Arsenal One great thing about Half-Life is the range of weaponry available. Crossbow? Check! Pistol? Check! RPG? Check! SMG? Check! And it goes on and on, with even more added in the expansion Half-Life: Opposing Force. Some guns are completely made up, too, such as the Gluon Gun, a personal favourite. Along with this there are explosives such as grenades, trip mines and satchel charges. Each gun and explosive has a different use and a situation to use it in, making the play of Half-Life very easy to switch up and appeal to many different people. Level Design Half-Life is a decently long game all things considered. 17 chapters altogether, some chapters longer than others, however all are a decent chunk of game. As most of the game takes place inside of the facility (named Black Mesa), most parts of the game are labs and rooms you'd find in a scientific facility. Parts are exploded or broken, due to the fighting that is taking place, along with various explosions. Enemy placement is done well, and the AI is also pretty good, some obviously smarter than others, the Black Ops being the hardest to kill in my opinion. With each scene change comes new scenery, always fitting the setting. I won't expand because I'd like to stay spoiler free, but the point is that all the level design is well done, from enemy placement to textures and such. PROs and CONs PROs -  A unique, interesting, cutscene-less story line that follows you through the game Easy to get the hang of, no weird controls or confusing catches.  Very simple to put down and pick back up, due to the above and other contributing factors. Despite the 1998 release date, some pretty nice graphics. A whole range of enemies to fight.  And on top of that, a giant range of weapons to kill those enemies with.CONs -  Occasionally - although not commonly - repetitive. Yeah, I've crawled through vents whacking Headcrabs before. A very linear path all the way through the game. Few ways to get lost or get side tracked. Maybe some people are happy about that? Not me. A somewhat underwhelming boss fight. Don't get me wrong, I loved the final boss, I just think there could have been more to it. A few confusing points where you're not particularly sure what to do.  Ammo for many guns is surprisingly scarce. Some of my favourites, for example the magnum, would have very little ammo around, and as such it would make it more likely for you to simply spray your SMG instead of trying some new tactic. Little music. There is music occasionally, and it really does increase the intensity when it is used, but I feel that more music could've been used. Final Thoughts - Half-Life is an old game. There's no question there. Thus it has been reviewed, talked about and mentioned many times previously. This review is less so recommending you to buy it and more tributing one of the best games in existance. Never played Half-Life before? Buy it, the only thing you'll regret is that you hadn't played it earlier. I wholeheartedly recommend this game, without question. Anybody who does not have this game in their library is seriously missing out. Enjoy this review? Did it help you choose whether to buy the game or not?Join my group, Cipher's Take On for more reviews, and share your own too!~ _BillCipher   ",97,13,0,5,7,0,9

												The Game that put a actual good plot in a 1st person shooting game. This was a very innovativeandfun game to play. The A.I. made monster react and fearsome to face. Half-Life was a defining moment in gaming history. This is a must in a true gamers archive. Even with it's age it holds up well to gameplay. The graphics are hold but are acceptable as they have done a good job then it makes it easier to play even after all this time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It would be hard to rate this game negatively - it's really far from being bad.But, sadly, unless you were present when it appeared, and experienced what news it brought into gaming, all you can see is an older game which plays *nicely*. Not fantastic, brilliant, just nice - it's new elements were used in the games coming after, becoming quite common. Half-life's value lies in it's gameplay and it's history, but mostly in it's history.I remember playing HL in multiplayer during informatics class around '99-2000, but I couldn't experience the campaign. Though I remember that the lightning-gun, wasp-gun (both alien weapons), and the vast array of weapons, each with alternate fire mode left us all in awe - we played Quake 2 multiplayer before, and HL was a huge step forward.Looking back to the game from 2016 (First game I played this year :) )  Half-life is a wild mixture of features that were great, features that could be improved upon and I couldn't really say a negative, besides the clunky bossfight.The graphics aged quite well - as there are no cutscenes, you don't really need to check characters from up close to notice the bad lipsync. (Not to mention that Black Mesa apparently uses clone guards and a few cloned scientists, they are so alike :P ) - but for example the zombie of HL1 in my opinion is much, much creepier than HL2's if we compare their looks. The sounds are great - footsteps can be heard and sound different on various materials. Also the 3D-sounds work incredibly well - with headphones you can pinpoint enemies by their sounds really accurately, and/or reacting fast for an incoming attack.Weapon diversity is huge, and while I wanted to use the MP5 for the whole game, I was quite content to see that once there were no marines present who used the machine gun, I could find no more ammo for it - good point for story and world integrity.Aaand speaking about the story - this is the point what I disliked about the game. I don't want to mention spoilers (Are there spoilers for a 18 year old game?) but the story basically consists of people telling you in A to go to B, and either you can directly go to B, or have to turn on/off some valves, doors, gates, enery to continue to B.  Many people says that this game is mysterious but that's only true because there is no world-building - you're Gordon Freeman, everyone's pawn and courier who runs forward, because he was told to do so, while the world is basically a corridor around you.  Not like it's a problem - afterall, game is from '98. While the story itself sounds really intresting if one's reading it, experience-wise basically I was shooting at everyone who wasn't wearing blue/labcoat and going forward... Maybe because of the constant first person gameplay (absolutely no cutscenes) I felt more like things there are just blocking me and are annoying than they were actually part of the story.And to balance this, the story's parts I liked - mostly mechanics and ideas.- The tentacle monster was a fantastic idea - disract with granades and sneak.- I liked how the environment could change - like an airstrike near causes the window to shatter, opening a way to go instead of it being openable, or just straight-out open.- Difficulty level changes more than damage and hp - enemy behaviour and attack patterns also change (to hell with Bethesda's harder -> bulletsponge difficulty scaling)After finishing the game (LOTS of idling involved, both because chat and leaving computer) to be honest I don't feel like I played a legend. It was a good game that would have been absolutely fantastic if I play it ~15 years ago, but still holds up remarkably well, and posing more challenge on normal than Bioshock Infinite in 1999 mode (hardest) . Games definitely got easier. But it was good to see the game from start to it's end, and finally, it made me much more intrested in HL2 as I was :)			",970,514,12,137,64,4,122

												While I think some of its sequel content rides the wave of their brand to be seen better than it actually is, the original Half-Life is a classic for a reason.While a tad lengthy and occasionally crippled by strained resources pitted against enemies that absolutely won't pull punches, what's undeniable is that Half-Life is NEVER boring. It's excellently paced and extremely varied, full to the brim of memorable and only occasionally frustrating encounters (looking at you, machine gun bunkers). While some of the weapons get a bit gimmicky, especially towards the end, unlike Opposing Force or HL2 they're never shoved in your face as the hot new thing, just dropped in your path to play with if you like.The final trip to Xen at the end of the game apparently has a reputation of being disappointing, but personally I didn't mind it at all, and the healing chambers were a welcome relief from limited resources pitted against two different armies. My main issue with Xen is at that point the game had been going on for about 12 hours and I just wanted it to end already.Other than length, the biggest weakness of Half-Life is probably its plot, in that for most of the middle section there isn't one. The game starts off with a nice slow boil, giving you a brief tour of Black Mesa before everything promptly goes to hell, building up from a survival horror feel against incoming aliens before gradually ramping up into an action game as the HECU marines go from merely killing everything and everyone in sight to targetting you specifically due to your stubborn refusal to die. By that point what little the plot has to say patters out until the third act, and all you're left with is an endless series of action and platforming sequences with no context besides ""this is the way forward."" They're not BORING, I must emphasize. It's just that they keep coming as Gordon Freeman consistantly fails to find the exit.If this seems like a mostly negative review, I'm rather critical by nature and it mostly stems from my feelings after finishing the game. As I said, its two chief issues are exhausting length and lacking motivation besides ""move forward and don't die."" From a purely gameplay standpoint the game is brilliant, full of sprawling setpieces which are linear enough to avoid getting lost but nonlinear enough to give you plenty of corners to explore for loot, and for as long as it is, it's a miracle it never felt repetitive.While I think Blue Shift is an all-around tighter package, Half-Life has absolutely earned its place as a cornerstone of gaming history.

												What a privilege it is for you if you have finished this game. Half-Life sits in a chair in a vast and golden hall along with only the highlords of the first-person-shooting genre. There we can find the likes of DooM, Wolfenstein, Quake, Unreal, BioShock, GoldenEye, Battlefield 2... Yes, Half-Life is that noble.Gordon Freeman is a physicist gone survivor/gunslinger in chaotic circumstances surrounding the accidental opening of a dimensional portal that brought about alien hostile presence into the Black Mesa Research Facility. The tension can be felt through every sensorial fibre of the narrative, from the stable low-pitch melodies of the soundtrack to the sudden appearances of creatures throughout the many corridors and laboratories found in the maps. The level design is extraordinary, and intelligent in progressively revealing the labyrinthine network of tunnels and ducts that hide vital items for the adequate fast-paced action of a quintessential shooter. However, such a network also provides the player with the strategic edge to approach danger and conflict, something innovative in itself for a genre that is - usually - sadly stigmatised by the shortcomings of linearity.Its daring features are a testament to the prime product of an age that it was. Half-Life subtly overcomes limitations of its time: it pioneered non-cutscene dynamic action and continuous immersive narrative, allowing the player to actually be part of everything s/he watches from behind the screen. Gordon may never be seen or heard in the de facto game, but the initial display of routine in Black Mesa (the famous tram sequence) drowns the player in unsullied immersion, not presenting any perspective bias or character automation. Gordon Freeman is as ""free"" a protagonist as it gets in a game of this kind.Be it for the strategic patience necessary to solve its puzzles, or for its compelling themes of cosmic conflict and the possible rough edges of scientific discovery, one shall find satisfaction in Half-Life. The dozens of Vortigaunts, Headcrabs, and Alien Grunts are there to remind the player that different kinds of shooting and approaching are necessary in order to survive both Black Mesa and Xen. How far into the dimensions of suspense and cunning one can get - is up to the player's willingness to brave this gaming gemstone from the late 1990s.			",219,35,14,36,22,1,38

Posted: July 11, 2016
												Two week ago I have (for the first time ever)  played the original Half-Life. For the people who don't know, Half-Life was the first game that Valve has ever released. The game started the success of Valve that resulted in many game classics and Steam (on which you are now reading this review). Half-Life itself is a first person shooter. The big difference between Half-Life and other first person shooters is that instead of just shooting, it also has exploration parts through puzzles and platforming. What I really liked is that nothing in the game takes the control away from the player. You go through the entire game and choose what to do by yourself at any given moment. The game doesn't have cutscenes and the story is experienced through gameplay and dialogue. But you can also just walk past all the characters in the story and just continue. I really appreciated this, because if you die you don't have to listen to what you already know. That makes following the story optional, even though there is only a little bit of story given which is basically just: You work at a research lab and everything went wrong. Try to escape. Many parts of the story are mysteries  you just have to figure out by yourself throughout the game. I only got annoyed once due to a scientist explaining what was already shown to me through gameplay. The first experience of playing Half-Life felt a little bit boring. The loading for areas was really annoying, and I thought the game didn't look all that well. After a while though I got into it, and I didn't stop. Thanks to this game, I have a new insane record of non-stop playing without leaving my chair for 13.2 hours, until I completed the game. I guess that also has to do with the fact that it was my first day of my vacation, and hadn't played a game for a long while.What makes the game so much fun is that you feel so free because nothing is told and you have to figure everything out by yourself through gameplay, which is really satisfying. I never really got stuck for a long while, because everything you find in a room has a reason to be there. The shooting is also fun and gets even more fun over time. The only problem I had, which might just be a personal issue, is that I think the weapons were not very well balanced. For instance, I wish the shotgun did more damage to make it an instant-kill up close. What I also liked is that in the game there are enough exploration parts and different roads to take, which resulted in me knowing  I haven't seen everything yet.After I finished Half-Life I found out that Valve has updated this original version of Half-Life with better textures, sound and other stuff so that explains why it is easier to look at the old things after a while and be amazed by what Half-Life really is.  In conclusion, I can say that I still recommend playing this updated version of the original Half-Life. What makes Half-Life special is the variety of shooting, puzzle solving and platforming and the lack of hand holding throughout the story and the entire game itself. Playing through Half-Life can make you think about whether we took more steps backwards than forwards with the games nowadays. P.S.I will be going through the whole Half-Life series. Here I will put links to my other Half-Life game reviews:Half-Life: Opposing ForceHalf-Life: Blue ShiftHalf-Life 2Interesting to share:The add-on Half-Life: decay ( originally for the ps2 ) is now playable as a Half-Life mod. Downloadable here at: moddb I played it and I have to say it is pretty descent in co-op.			",131,29,1,9,5,0,6

												Don't you DARE let the Graphics and release date fool you, this game is glorious. Challenging, fun. Exciting, and kinda scary, this game has got to be one of my favs. BUT DONT STOP HERE!!!! Play ALL the half life games, you can't let it end here. However, I would suggest that you are experienced at FPS,  cause this game is very, VERY hard. I'd recommend playing half life 2 and the episodes before this if you're not experienced at FPS.

												Damn, this is the best shooter I've ever played. I don't have any nostalgia for this and I'm not even a big fan of shooters, but this game is so well made that I can't do anything but praise it. Sure it might not have aged that well visually but the atmosphere and uniqe look of the game shines through after all these years. The gameplay is what you might expect from a shooter, you shoot things with guns. However when it's combined with the amazing level design, varied and interesting enemies and the sense of isolation this game is rising above every shooter on the market by a mile.

												Half-life was the first game that I properly remember playing. It was given to me by a friend when I was in Grade 5 and I remember playing until the first part of 'Residue Processing'. By that time, holidays were over and my friend had entered the Xen world and I was full of awe when I saw him playing in a low-gravity world with alien weapons. I decided to return back to Half-life. But alas, I had to move houses and with the passage of time and age, I somehow forgot to continue playing Half-life.Then surprise surprise I saw the half-life pack on a steam sale. No second questions were asked and I immediately bought the pack. I had to finish this game. With its outdated graphics and linear gameplay, I wouldn't be surprised if people thought Minecraft 'looked' better than Half-life. But let me tell you, there is no other game (aside from Half-life 2) that could even come close to the brilliance of its gameplay. The storyline and the gameplay itself is revolutionary and not many games today can even compare to the shooter known as Half-life.I shall always remember today (15th August 2016) as the day that I finally finished the original Half-life after 14 years. Thank you Valve for making the game that introduced me to the world of gaming.I can finally sleep in peace before I move onto another masterpiece known as Half-life 2. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half Life, one of the many games that ""changed the game"". However, no game innovated it's genre as much as Half Life. Before 1998, fps games didn't have any story, instead you simply blasted through levels to beat the game. Half Life added a story, with talking characters and all the parts of a storyline you heard in that crappy English class. Then Half Life starred a huge modding community, which produced some of Valve's biggest franchises, not to mention started up some other popular developers. After all of this, Half Life 2 came out and became the new star. Overall Half Life is great, and I recommend it for everyone to try. P.S: Notice how I didn't recommend Half Life: Source? Yeah don't get that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port.			",62,0,0,0,4,0,1

About Half-LifeThe game that started it all.Even though it was made back in 1998,it is still a gem.I don't vote games by their graphics,but by their gameplay.This was an immersing,wonderful and addicting experience for me.I lived another life.In this game.The game has everything a gamer asks for: Immersing Gameplay,Indulging story,A Nice Selection of Weapons,and graphics that were thrilling in the year it was made,but are all old now.Even now this title holds up till today,shining its glory as the first game that Valve ever made,and a game that changed Gaming itself.Now I will have a look at the main aspects of a good game.The GameplayExcellent.Either you are blasting monsters from an alternate dimension or just trying to pick off those squad men who just don't seem to put you in peace.There were a few places where it did get a little bit boring,but that was because I couldn't wait until I would experience something new.The terrain in the game is nicely made,even though it is pretty old due to the date it was made.The places you travel through are pretty different,you won't be bored of seeing the same old place over and over again.The game itself is nicely balanced;except that they could have put less ammo in the game,so you wouldn't always have a gun loaded.The Story A nice story is told throughout the game,and that is guaranteed to keep you hooked until the last moment of the game.Even though it doesn't have any cutscenes,it tells its story just wonderfully.It keeps you in first person mode all of the time,so it makes you ""live"" the character all the way through the story.All the stuff that is happening in the game seems kind of logical,as if could happen in real life.The characters are well done as well,for they act as normal people would act.They are as they should be,they speak,fight,help you and do other stuff.And there is a wierdly acting character which stands out in the game;but I will let you figure that out for yourself.There aren't the same scientists all over and over again,but we can't say this with security guards.The enemies are widely assorted and won't make you think that they are dumb,but play as they are real and trying to get you.No dull moment will get you in this game,so don't be afraid of experiencing any in this game. The GraphicsFrom Black Mesa labs to even Alien fields of doom,this game is amazing.It now has its own HD models,so a few things look better when the models are turned ""ON"".Any computer will be able to get this game running,so why not jump in it already?And as this game was made in 1998,don't expect modern graphics.But that couldn't stop you from playing this game,could it?The terrain is kind of blocky and the characters as well,but if you look past that point get ready to indulge into a game that made gaming as it is today.And the graphics aren't that bad,everything is quite understandable.They have made the graphics the best way they could,and I don't blame them because I don't vote a game by its graphics.And if you can't stand the graphics there is a Source version of the game,made by Valve as well.There is a version made by fans as well,but I wouldn't recommend that because it is modified a bit.But the original is the best in my opinion as it is the completly unmodified version of half life,and the best out there.Of course,that is if you look past the graphics.There are even little details specified in the originl game,but they won't be seen so good and will be kind of blurred.But be sure to keep your eyes lit,for there are many levers,buttons and things like that throughout the game,that blend in with the enviroment. The WeaponsThere is a wide assort of weapons to fit you in this game,but do not expect too much.There are the main weapons you would except from a game like this,and maybe a little bit more due to an ""Monster Invasion"" going on all around you.The game has its own signature weapon: A Crowbar.But that is also the only melee weapon that you can use in this game.While you progress through the game you will find weapons,but there aren't many,so every weapon you get,you make use of,because all of them are unique.As I won't spoil much here,I will just tell you that there are weapons from the pistol even to such weapons like a rocket launcher,and a few of alien techologies are found in the game as well.You will find yourself exploring all around you to get some ammo for your favourite weapon,because it gives you tons of ammo for a wide selection of weapons,and the ammo that you need may not be findable anywhere.When you shoot a gun it feels like you shoot a gun,meaning that you will find the gun bouncing back in your hand when you shoot it,and you can hear the sound for gun firing is well done as well.But when shooting a rocket launcher you will not bounce back,but if you move while shooting it the rocket will go wrong and hit another spot,depending on which way you moved.Even if you don't have any ammo,you get to use a alien techonlogy which has unlimited ammo.Even though it recharges over time,it doesn't take much of it and it has special abilities.All in All  Half-Life is the best Retro-Action Shooter! 10/10 From MeSweep  ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												Half-Life is well, quite possibly one of the best FPS games ever created. This was my favorite game during my childhood which led into Counter-Strike. Coupled with great action, detailed environments and an awesome sci-fi story nothing beats Half-Life. After all these years it's still an awesome game and is a joy to play in super high resolution and also with the included HD textures. Everyone needs to play Half-Life at least once in their lifetime, you won't be disappointed with an unforgettable story and protagonist - Gordon Freeman.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As Vavle's debut into the gaming industry, this game still holds up to this very day. The fact that you are always in the shoes of the scientist, Gordon Freeman, was revolutionary at the time and I can see why. Although I have yet to play Half-Life 2, this game is an incredible start to the Half-Life franchise and the gaming company, Valve, as a whole.The game is to near perfection but there are some problems here and there but that wouldn't stop you from enjoying the game.

												The success of this game started it all for Valve. Team Fortress, Counter-Strike and countless amounts of other mods. It had become a hallmark of FPS quality for many years to come until Half-Life 2 came out to raise the bar even higher. This legendary status helps to alleviate the ravages of time the graphics have suffered. But, as any Counter-Strike player will tell you, it is not that bad considering the age of the game, it's still approachable for younger players. The game's design is very variable and interactive, which cannot be said about a myriad of modern shooters. The remarkable sound and authentic music will help to create a memorable, mysterious, sci-fi atmosphere. Xen, being the most criticized part of the game, seemed quite enjoyable to me. It offers a much needed diversion from the rest of the game, most of which takes place in steel corridors. This game represents a milestone, thanks to which a series of events lead to the creation of our beloved Steam. Praise be Half-Life, the Almighty! :)			",191,33,9,25,4,1,16

												Half-Life is a first-person shooter game from Valve. The first of the series.You play as Gordon Freeman, a MIT graduated scientist work at Black Mesa research facility. You were on an experiment with your fellow scientist when suddenly something went wrong and then cause unforeseen consequences. Now you only have one goal, survive. You will also meet the mysterious G-Man. This game focus on the story, but still offer many good choice of weapons and one of the best classic shooter.Half-Life was a foundation to modern first-person shooter game Counter-Strike. Half-Life has great sci-fi story that is very entertaining. I recommend this.Rating 10/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												I mean, it's Half-Life.It's one of the best games ever made, even if it is now extremely outdated. Half-Life was one of the first narrative, story driven first person games that was interesting and actually worth playing, not to mention you have to solve puzzles and do more than just shoot guys or aliens - heck, you get to shoot both. Plus weird female bodysuit assassins. And Ospreys. And scientists, if you want.This game is literally the root of basically all modern modding in games, other than Team Fortress, Quake, Doom, and Unreal. And along with System Shock and Deus Ex, it is also the root of all modern first person shooter game design - both in story, level design, soundtrack, environmental immersion and interactivity, and in being player friendly.If you don't own this or haven't played it, you really need to re-evaluate what you're doing on PC in the first place. It may be a young adult in terms of the PC family, but hell if you haven't played Half-Life, what HAVE you played? You really need to. Frankly, Black Mesa has now made the original Half-Life look pretty chumpy, but you are only allowed to say that if you played Half-Life when it was new.So play both, starting here.

												Even though this game is almost 15 years old and uses a modified Quake engine, it is still one of the most FUN and best shooters ever to be made. In fact all other first person shooters and games in general can learn from Half Life 1. The game world is extremely immersive. There are no level ends, there is no text to read, there are no scores and everyone talks to you without freezing you into a cut scene. All of this makes you feel less like you are a player playing a game, but you are indeed the hero Gordon Freeman. Characters recognize you, talk to you, and you can have them come with you or stay put. Security guards that come with you will shoot enemies (slowly).The story is that you are silent protagonist Gordon Freeman (you'll feel like him by the end) and you work for Black Mesa, your standard super secret facility. Something goes horribly wrong and uh. The formula is very simple, but they execute it so well that other games have copied it and failed (Doom 3). Needless to say you need to fight your way out through the facility, on the desert (being chased by a helicopter), and everything else would just be a spoiler. There are no levels, no loading screens. Loading is seamless and happens during downtime.Half Life 1 has simple controls and an optional tutorial level. There are buttons for jumping, crouching (sneaking), using your flashlight (that needs to be off to charge it), shooting, secondary shooting (for machine guns) and ""using"" things. The game is always in run mode and character speed seems to be fast. Too fast sometimes, but there is that sneak button that will slow you down.But how is the first person shooting? There is a wide variety of guns and each has a certain joy and usefulness to them. Even the simple pistol is useful for lesser enemies 8 hours into the game. There is a shotgun, a machine gun with grenade launcher, grenades, explosives you detonate, wall sensors with explosives, a harpoon, a laser guided rocket launcher that once it launches you point your cursor and it will turn accordingly, lasers, homing missiles, head crabs and more. An amazing array that you continue to get even up to the final levels areas. To swap weapons you push 6 number keys and press some keys twice to access some weapons like the shotgun / machine gun / harpoon.You start with a crowbar good for breaking grates, and destroying boxes. Destroying boxes is how you will find most items and ammo. Instead of just finding things scattered on the floor, on shelves or on a desk you need to bash open boxes to find the good stuff. You can also push or pull the boxes too which is nice for puzzle solving and platforming.The enemies are just as diverse and each one requires you to think and act differently. Since I don't know the name of any enemy I'll fumble through this. The start enemies are lesser creatures that will start on the floor and jump at you. 2 shots from a pistol take them out. There are zombie-ish aliens that take a shotgun or two, but they are easy enough to avoid. Aliens that teleport in and beam electricity at you will cause you to hide, pudgy little alien crawler / hoppers will make you shoot from a distance because they will send out a small shockwave. Standard soldiers that will shoot machine guns, throw grenades and coordinate attacks against you like flanking. Ceiling huggers that are yucky red globs on the ceiling with long rope like tongues that when they catch you, you'll be pulled up and eaten... if you don't shoot them. Giant aliens with homing missiles too. There is a wide variety of enemies and bosses. I can't list them all.The game also shines with its tricks and traps and will throw a puzzle or challenge at you to keep you thinking. But in this game it doesn't feel like a puzzle or a challenge. It seems natural. There can be a hidden turret where the fun is making your choice how to take it out... Grenade, explosive, shooting it and getting shot in the process, running by it or just not hitting the trip wire to start it in general. Wall sensor explosives, push and pull box puzzles, pushing buttons, hopping hanging boxes over a pit, conveyer belts, using a sky cannon to destroy walls, using turrets, on rails vehicles that you have a lot of control over, water puzzles, high jump pads and so on. There is a lot of variety and it's never the same thing twice.To sum it up, this is a diverse and VERY FUN game. It has a sense of humor to it and you'll feel like you are Gordon Freeman through the game's well crafted immersion. Puzzles, shooting and challenges all melded together into one fantastic game and I can't say that too often.			",1125,324,51,104,96,15,167

												18 years after the release of this game, I feel a sudden desire to review it, as if anyone doesn't know about its acclaim already.The videogame that marked Valve's global debut, HALF-LIFE is an absolutely genre-defining release. Fresh for its time, unique, different, and still fun, it took the PC gaming world by storm in the late 90s, with its critical praise following it greatly into the turn of the century, with a large modding community and a great engine (GoldSrc) that carried a fulfilling lifespan until the release of its successor, the dominant Source Engine.In HALF-LIFE, you are put into the shoes of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a 27 year-old theoretical physicist working for the mysterious BLACK MESA Research Facility located in New Mexico. After an experimental test goes wrong, Gordon is found fighting for his life, defending himself from hostile alien lifeforms crossing over to Earth from the borderworld, Xen, after the experiment creates a resonance cascade, opening an interdimensional portal between planets. Gordon meets many of his colleagues along the way, struggling for their own safety against the alien forces, and eventually, the massive military unit HECU, sent to wipe out anything related to the incident. Gordon travels through numerous complexes, canyons, and worlds in his quest for survival.But that's the special thing about Half-Life: it never feels like you're just ""playing as Gordon Freeman."" It feels like every action is your own. Every step, jump, and gunshot is a power that YOU hold, not just something you're telling the protagonist to do. This is a goal that Valve had set out to achieve, a goal that was realized through the use of NO protagonist dialogue, an uncommon detail in FPS games at the time. This helped breathe life into the games motto: Run, Think, Shoot, Live.The controls are great, with the same control scheme being subsequently used in most future Valve games. The gunplay is fun, with a fair amount of weaponry, both human and alien. The atmosphere is what I truly think makes the game. It brings such a feeling of desperation, dread, and isolation that I didn't quite get in the future titles. A true ""you against the world"" feeling, where every corner can pose a new threat. It's such an intense feeling of cold desolation, unforgiving and eerie as every footstep echoes throughout the metallic hallways that stretch deeper into treacherous facilities. This is a game that greatly defined my vision of what games should be. It has so much heart put into it that it's mindblowing for a debut game. There's just so much life in Half-Life that I find myself replaying it every so often to this day. Despite its look, it never grows old. It may be difficult to get into if you haven't played before, but anyone who has played it could tell you it's worth the time.There's not enough good things that I can say about Half-Life, but it's best if you experience it and decide for yourself. While not without its flaws, this is still about as close as I can get to considering a game perfection. Everybody should give this at least one playthrough in their lifetime.			",187,24,4,14,6,3,6

												What to say about Half Life..... Okay, let me say that I originally bought the game\'s Game of the Year edition(included Team Fortress Classic) back in...... what? \'98? Early \'99 maybe? Anyway...... The hours you see logged for this game under Steam are WAY off. I didn\'t make the switch from WON to Steam until it was forced on us in 2004. What to say about the game itself.... put simply; it\'s AMAZING! When I saw the initial opening scenes..... I was blown away. 16 years later, I\'m still playing it, and I still find it a bit of a challenge. Half Life re-defined the FPS genre, and in such a positive way, it is still selling. It can be argued that the graphics are dated, and perhapse they are. Personally, I don\'t think so. I think they are as much a part of the game as the abilities you get as Gordon Freeman. Half Life won over 50 Game of the Year awards, and rightly so. If you enjoy FPS games, and this game isn\'t in your collection..... GET IT! It has a great blend of action, stuff to destroy, things to make you think, and lots of hidden Easter Eggs.  ",66,4,0,1,1,1,8

Half-Life was not only a critical and commercial success, it also (along with Doom, Quake, & Halo) helped revolutionize the first person shooter genre.Btw I love the tagline ""Run. Think. Shoot. Live.""Pros:-Great Singleplayer Campaign.-Lots of cool enemies to kill.-Great Multiplayer.-Mod Support.Cons-Few of the weapons (9MM Handgun, Hivehand, Tripmine) arent used often/usefull in later parts of the singleplayer.-Not many people play multiplayer.Notes-Gordon Freeman is badass.10/10Buy this now!

												Half-Life is definitely not for everyone, not today when players are not used to outdated graphics and higher difficulty. It's undoubtedly a great game. It's different from everything I've ever played. I decided to play it on medium difficulty because why not? I am used to playing shooters after all. Hell, it was so frustrating, sometimes. Not because the enemies would be that hard to kill, they were not, but because I got lost and didn't know how to continue and while I was going through all the rooms again to find my way out, I fell down here, lost a bit health there and after some time I couldn't continue without loading an older save to try to play that part again and to be more careful this time.In chapter 6, Blast Pit, I totally lost clue about what to do next. I was struggling to motivate myself to keep playing. But then I found those amazing walkthrough videos made by BigMacDavis and he and his love for Half-Life made me want to continue. I really have to recommended them because it helps you, it's fun and very nice to listen to.After chapter 6 I started to love the game more and more. I got several new weapons, also unique ones, which were fun to use and very effective. The use of different weapons for different enemies was very satisfying. Valve did a really good job there.If you like sci-fi and shooters and don't care about nicest graphics. If you want action without too many dialogues and if you don't get easily frustrated. Or if you just want to know why this game is so popular, give it a chance. It's worth of it!			",252,57,1,14,4,1,0

												Rating: 8/10Overview First Person ShooterThe Good:+ 80% of the game has some fantastic level design, in fact it has some of the best level design in any FPS  game, everything just feels right.+ The pacing in the game is near flawless, the game never relies on the same gimmick twice, and every chapter is designed  around a certain concept to keep things interesting. The game offers a great mix of puzzle solving and action.+ The game has a variety of different weapons to fit the situation at hand as well as your playstyle+ For an old game the AI is surprisingly pretty good, granted it does get stupid sometimes but that is forgivable+ I love the sound effects in the game. To me the music and sound effects are a big part of the Half Life experience.The Bad:-20% of the level design is bad, sometimes its hard to figure out where to go and some of it just doesn't make a whole lot  of sense. -the last few chapters of the game are awful.- I experienced numerous glitches in the gameConclusionsHalf LIfe is the father of modern FPS. Back when it was released I would have given it a 9/10 but the game for all its  strengths is starting to show its age. However given its age it still holds up better than most games and being a FPS that  means something. This game really should be experienced by everyone to see how modern FPS games came to be.

												This game. This great, great game. It is simply a timeless classic. For it's time, the graphics were great. The gameplay still, today, feels fun and exciting, running through black mesa, trying to survive against all odds. This game revolutionized gaming and set a new goal for first-person games to beat. The voice acting was, and still, simply is astonishing. Being made by such a small company at the time, it still astounds me to this day. The storyline is great, and each and every weapon feels real and powerful, so each kill feels great/rewarding. I simply love this game and can say nothing more of it other than: ""Buy this game!!!""			",80,20,0,11,10,1,4

												If you are looking for a game that you can't beat within the first day, aim your crosshairs towards the Half-Life franchise by Valve. In Half-Life, you take the role of Black Mesa employee, Gordon Freeman. Throughout the game, you must work to destory monster life, soldiers, and straight up demonic beings that are out to destroy you. This game requires skill, strategy , and raw FPS skills. Half-Life's pure fun and addictive shooting make up for Its poor graphics,  (though take in mind this game was made in 1998, so it wasn't considered poor back then). If you are thinking about getting this game, it is a must. It is one of the most classic shooters of all time neighboring Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Halo, and Unreal Tournament. Will you embark on this Journey through New Mexico laboritories and planets that are out of this galaxy? Then Half-Life is the game for you! RyanLionZion			",2,1,0,0,1,0,0

												Words cannot describe how amazing this game was for its time.After playing this title for once again I remembered why half life became so famous. Such an incredible length, puzzling difficulty and amazing level design. Fun wepons and above all, a mind blowing story to be told.And that's how a new cult started. With a giant leap ahead in the gaming history by valve in 1998 setting the flag for a series of success and amazing game releases.If you are hard cored enough to search into old games while a half life fan then you got to test yourself by playing and finishing this game!

												First played Half Life when I was younger, however as I was newer to games, I wasn't smart enough to beat it. Now that I have played it again after many years I can say that this is such a fun game!Yes the graphics are a little dated, but the nostalgia you get from playing an FPS that also has puzzles is so satisfying! Would recommend to anyone who hasn't played it yet!			",58,8,1,5,7,0,12

Product received for free
												Half life was the first FPS game that I played and it means a lot to me. I've played many first person shooters but nothing comes close to this one. This game is revolutionary. I've played this game six times now and it just keeps getting better the more I play it. Of course it has crappy graphics and a few bugs here and there, but such things are expected from a game made in 1999. Half life was the game that led to the creation of some very successful mods such as Counter Strike, Day of Defeat, Ricochet and team fortress. If it wasn't for the increasing popularity of this game and the mods, Steam itself wouldn't exist. This game has made some everlasting impressions in my memory and is one that I will never forget.A must-buy for any PC gaming enthusiast, or for anyone looking for a good game.EDIT: Nominated Half Life for the 'Test of Time award'.

												Undeniably iconic, it set an unprecedented bar of quality for years following its release. Much has been said about Half-Life, so much so that saying anything is likely reiterating upon the words of others. Maybe that isn't such a bad thing, Half-Life still holds up as one of the best FPS ever made, I can hardly fault it on its gameplay; whilst yes some parts are notably weaker than others (Ch 8 and 18 come to mind,) it's still a must play.

The story as well is quite good and I just appreciate how the game does not take away control from you. Pick this up if you haven't played it, it's a must buy for PC intiates.

												Honestly my favorite game of all time. I don't think there's every going to be a game that can ever topple it, it's a true legend, and if you've never played it, you should most certainly do so now, because a game like this is a truely the best game there ever was.As good as many other games valve has made, Half-Life is by far the best they've ever done. This goes for the same with the sequel and the episodes after that. Half-Life is a very historical piece in gaming history, and hopefully will never be forgotten.On the game itself, Half-Life is a First Person Shooter where you play as a scientist known as Gordon Freeman, who works at a place called Black Mesa. I would go on from here, but if you have the chance, it's best if you play this game blind.The overall gameplay is amazing, and even after you beat it, I still find it entertaining to play it over and over again. The difficulty is one of the most fair, and can be spiked if you prefer a challenge.The soundtrack for this game is without any doubt my favorite game OST of all time. It's such a treat to anyone's ears, and this all comes from a game from 1998, which means it has aged very well, and always will.Lastly, the storyline is well made and quite unique. There's nothing I can put down on this game. This game is the purest masterpiece, not just on steam, but out of all games as well.			",42,4,0,6,4,1,1

												The best thing happened to me back in 1998, it was the year that the PC game Half-Life entered my life. I remember playing the demo, Half-Life: Uplink and going crazy for it. So, what did I think of the full game?It blew my F**KING mind! Mere words are insufficient to describe how freaking AWESOME this game was (and still is). I shall however attempt to do just that.The story is excellent. You begin as Gordon Freeman, a scientist in a secret laboratory complex called Black Mesa. The suspense builds as you make your way to the test labs and then, once there, it all goes horribly wrong. Your world is thrown upside down. Black Mesa has suffered a catastrophic system failure. Your friends and colleagues are dead or dying. It seems you are trapped far underground. But worse is yet to come.Combat is good and fun seeing enemies gibbed by your explosives. There is a lot to explore. The facility is vast, although not every door can be opened. Music is good and fits into the location of Black Mesa and the level you are on. Enemies are varied and vary in ability. Each section/level has its own theme and look, along with its own challenges.Half-Life was helped back in the day by the hundreds of mods that gamers made, enhancing and extending the Black Mesa complex. With them, the game seemed to last forever, which is no bad thing.The game comes with multiplayer and I must say was an absolute delight to be involved in. I spent many hours with my friends competing and having much fun in the process. I actually became rather good at it, if I do say so myself.After over 15 years the graphics obviously shows its age but in all honesty, who cares? I don't. It's actually one of the reasons I love the game and have such fond memories of it. Most of the character models look and sound the same, so making out who is who is almost impossible, which shows in the sequel.There may be Half-Life II and Black Mesa, which are graphically superior but if not already done so, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you play this game. You shall not be disappointed.10/10 (for its time) ",131,11,0,30,5,2,15

The game possesses a constant atmosphere of adventure, mystery, and what might be lurking around the next corner. It has an involving story and many different game mechanics that are fun and easy to use throughout the entire game. It really feels like you're inside the Black Mesa facility and it's definitely a game worth your time.(Also, you might see that I have 50 hours on record so far... Yeah... I love this game.)

												When I've played this game for the first time, I've just realized that why do people really want HL3 asap. Half life 1 was probably the best game you could find back to 2000 and I would still rather to play this wonderful game than wasting my money on 60$ games that requires you to buy a big loan of DLCs. Anyway, this game maybe looks so f*ckin' old but It was GOTY. The story was wonderful, the gameplay was great, the weapons were cool, the game progression is not that easy that you think cuz you need a tough mind to play it. The microwave made to screw around with scientists and finally the mods that made me ROLF. The gameplay time is not short.11/10Game of the day, week, month, year and ever.			",28,6,2,2,2,2,1

												This game came out more than 17 years ago but is still one of my favorites in terms of what you do and how fascinating the great storytelling is. This game set a ton of milestones for the game industry.Of course its graphics are from 1998 but you can still enjoy it.This was the first game from valve and still one of the best. You are controlling a silent protagonist named Gordon Freeman and you have to shoot your way through a very detailled world (at least for 1998). While I much prefer the fan made game Black Mesa (you can get it on Steam aswell), you can still enjoy this game if you are tolerant of older graphics and sound. If you are a fan of older first person shooters, I recommend getting this while it is on sale.			",53,23,1,6,10,1,5

												DO YOU KNOW WHO ATE ALL THE DONUTS?I'm not sure what I can say about Half-Life that hasn't been said already, but I'll try anyway.This was Valve's flagship title, and it's definitely a classic. It was revolutionary in its day - November 1998, to be precise - for its (somewhat) realistic combat and overall approach to its narrative. There were no cutscenes or voiceovers for the main character. You were put into the shoes of Gordon Freeman, PhD. That made the game all the more immersive and involving, and it is indeed both.The plot itself is still very good and elegantly presented, if not entirely as gripping nowadays where half-realistic aliens and gundudes are more prevalent in gaming. The first section of the game involves you commuting to work in a labryinthine government research facility; the presentation and interactivity present during your commute (and preparation for the workday) make it work quite well, and it's still believable.Then you do a big experiment and everything goes to Hell in a handbasket. Hostile aliens are teleporting in from the alternate dimension your employers were foolish enough to screw around with, and you have to fight your way out of the laboratories with a scant few weapons at first. Things only get worse from there.This is primarily a first-person shooter, and the gunplay is good if a bit repetitive. You eventually carry a whole armory's worth of guns, from an MP5 to a rocket launcher to guns that shoot tau and gluon particles (creative license; I'm pretty sure tau and gluon particles can't actually explode people) to an alien bio-gun that shoots angry bees. The graphics...were probably great back when it was released, and while they still seem timeless to me they haven't aged quite as gracefully as Half-Life 2's graphics.There's also a fair bit of puzzling to be had; mostly moving objects around, jumping puzzles and finding the right switch in an area. They're not terribly hard, but they intersperse very nicely with the shooting. Since this game is partially based off the Quake engine, your character moves rather fast by default, which is something to keep in mind.The AI was unprecedented in its day, but not quite as stellar now. They can still put up a good fight though, and the game can become very intense if you're not careful. The music is excellent; a fitting mix of unsettling ambient electronica and rock. The last part of the game I will not spoil as much as others might, but it involves a fairly larger amount of jumping puzzles than the rest of the game, as well as some...interestingly designed levels. It's not exactly bad, but it's definitely a change from the rest of the game that you may not be entirely comfortable with. Which is perhaps what Valve was going for...It's worth mentioning that the multiplayer deathmatch is still around and pretty good, if rather fast-paced. Haven't played much of it, unfortunately. This game also spawned what is perhaps the biggest mod base in video game history. Multiple multiplayer mods for this game became separate commercial releases sanctioned (and usually developed in part by) Valve themselves, such as Counter-Strike and Team Fortress.Overall, I would recommend this as a piece of history, a classic and as a good game even after all these years. Mostly. If you want classic Half-Life with the Source engine, you could try Half-Life Source, or if you want a modernized version you could try Black Mesa. There were also two expansions by Gearbox Software, Opposing Force and Blue Shift, and I'd recommend them if you liked classic Half-Life. Sven Coop is also free on Steam for co-op adventures in the original Half-Life engine, and it even comes with a complementary copy of the HL campaign.			",195,39,3,14,32,1,35

												FPS genre started out with Id Software's Wolfenstein in 1992. That same company later released Doom, and for quite a while most shooters were simply tagged as Doom Clones. Games like Quake, Duke Nukem, Shadow Warrior, Star Wars Dark Forces, Unreal were among them. These games lacked narrative and had a very maze like level design. It's very different from what we have today in our shooters.Then in 1998, came Half Life. Love it or hate it, this game is the blueprint for all the shooters that come out these days. It was among the first shooters to have narrative. To account for the narrative, it had to make the level design more linear. The game is driven by the story, so to say. Level would be build around it, having set pieces here and there.GameplayGames from the Doom era focused on you trying to avoid the incoming projectiles that are shot at you. They focused on mobility. Since they had a very maze like level design. They also would usually have a lot of secret places, where you could get better gear or ammo. Exploration was another thing that was focused on in older fps.Half Life on other hand played differently from earlier FPS games. Accuracy wasn't something that was a thing back then, but with Half Life it was. You had a crosshair and you could not only look at x-axis, but also move your camera up and down (y-axis). All weapons in Half Life would also feature recoil on their guns.You would also face enemies, with guns just like you. They would have cheater like accuracy. You wouldn't be able to dodge their incoming bullets. All you will be able to do is go behind cover.I hope you find all this familiar.That said, Half Life did feature elements from Doom games - mostly when encountering aliens. Headcrabs for example will jump at you. Vortigons would shot a green beam with a few seconds of delay. There are some that that spit corrosive fluid. All of these are dodge-able. The game also has Grunts, which are very big bullet sponges.When encountering normal soldiers on other hand, it will play like today's shooter. Still, there is a fair amount of both in the game.The game still has plenty of secret places with ammo and weapons stashes, so exploration isn't completely off the table.Finally, it features a lot of puzzle solving and platforming, which is a bit unusual for an FPS. I personally found it very frustrating.StoryBack in the days, there was no story in FPS games. And even if there was, it would be delivered via cutscenes. Well, Half Life changed that. Like a said, a linear level design. Along that level, they would have friendly NPCs, with whom you could interact with, and cinematic set pieces. You would do more than just ""run and gun"".Half Life story may not be unique, but it's about how they deliver it, that makes it so special. No one has ever done that, up till that point. They were the first.Also, it may not look like it, but back then it was amazing. The game didn't even come to PS1 simply because the console couldn't handle the technology involved. Valve used GldSrc, which was based on Quake's engine. It's a groundbreaking game.The only thing i want to complain about is the sounds. It really hurt my ears.This game consists of 18 Chapters and an Epilogue, giving you 2 choices. It's fairly long - about 15 hours.ConclusionI really like Half Life. In fact i like it more than the second game. It has elements from both pre Half Life and post Half Life. I highly recommend it to anyone.Currently, there is a fan made remake called Black Mesa. Better graphics, but the same game. It was developed since 2004 and was released to the public by 2012. That's 8 years of hard work. It's still missing 4 levels, but they plan to add them at some point. Nevertheless, i suggest you to support them. ",498,99,13,68,57,7,114

												It may look old, but it's a blast from the past. You play as Gorden Freemen, a scientist, who does a science exprement for Black Mesa. But something goes wrong and a portal opens and Aliens come through. You collect weapens to help you fight  Zombies, Aliens and the Milatry (If thats what it is) and reach the service to get help. But while all this is happening, yiour wearing a hazard suit that has alot of tracking devises on it, so the Milatry track you at all times. Over all, the game has a fantasice story line, and its not just a first person shooter, but theres puzzles for you to figure out along the way. I would rate this game a 9 out of 10. Great Job Valve!			",44,3,0,3,4,1,0

												Experience the original masterpiece of a game.Have a taste of the original first person shooter with a story completely based on scripted events, which became the catalyst for the creation of Counter Strike, The Ship, Natural Selection, and arguably Team Fortress (even though TF existed in the Quake engine before). If you're coming from Half Life 2 and wondering how this game is different, the main difference really is that this game does not hold your ♥♥♥♥ing hand. Prepare for pure hell to be unleashed onto you as you realize that the easiest difficulty in this game is harder than the hardest difficulty in Half Life 2. Cower in fear as enemies that take a quarter of your ammunition to kill charge you from every direction. Be confused as you end up in mazes with no idea of where the ♥♥♥♥ you're supposed to go and deathtraps awaiting you if you make the wrong turn. Oh and get to fight a giant testicle attached to a 20 foot tall armored spider. Ultimately, if you're up to the challenge, I highly recommend this entertaining masterpiece of a game!

												The first game in the Half Life Series is great, even though it is kind of old and you maybe have played through the second game in the series. You are not playing this game for the story, but for the exploration and adventure in an older game and story; and that is why the graphics and lack of enemy-differentiation does not ruin the experience. The game tries to shake the story up by using different maps, playstyles and boss-like creatures, but a great game still evolves around the enemies and the guns, and that is why it can get boring and pretty repetitive in 4-6 hours.All in all, if you are interested in the Half Life Series and you are looking for a retro-styled game, this is for you. Do not buy this game if the money is tight, save up and buy something featured in the Steam Store.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT: DO YOU SUCK♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Okay, both Crack Life mods were fantastic!It's pretty long for it's size and hard as ♥♥♥♥! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  (all the puns intended. Completion time: 12h, game size: 500mb (wow) and it's pretty difficult)So the first Half Life. It was pretty good. Yeah I know, my first time playing Half Life and it's 2016 (I wasn't even born when it was first released). I think it's remastered but imo it looks better than source version. The few downsides are that you need to really look for your objectives. The really tiny button, switch or hole are easy to miss. Had to look up walkthrought a few good times (good old games eh? :D). The difficulty is more like: easy - easy , normal - hard, hard - just ragequit. And lastly the AI can be a bit weird and unco-operative and the enemies seem to be so mlg that they never really miss. Don't really think there are other downsides. Oh yeah the music was really great, whenever it played! It's really good for it's time! A classic.Might even buy the DLCs on the next sale. And of course need to try out ""Crack life"". Yeah, because I'm that mature (thanks Jolly♥♥♥♥♥♥).Well, off to Half Life 2!			",68,0,1,4,3,0,0

												Half-Life - One of the most iconic, revolutionary and groundbreaking games of all time, then and now. The original Half-Life and it's expansions are by far some of my all time favourite games, I'd even venture to say that they are in fact my favourite FPS games even to this day, Half-Life defeats any modern FPS game (and Halo games) no competition.I don't know where to begin when it comes to listing my favourite things about this game, there are hardly any faults with it at all. Sure, the graphics may be questionable to some by todays standards, but for it's time they were groundbreaking. A vast selection of weapons, areas, an amazing storyline and puzzles make this one really brilliant single-player experience. The Hazard course by extension is also the most well implemented tutorial I've seen in a game.This is a game that I could play for many more years to come and still enjoy it by setting myself challenges. The only thing that would improve upon Half-Life (and Opposing Force, even Blue Shift) would be to create a list of acheivements just so there is some extra singleplayer playability, but other than that, there is nothing out there in the FPS world that even comes close to matching Half-Life, and I doubt that there ever will be. Valve are amazing story tellers, this is evident in essentially every title that they release with the exception of one or two more silly games and I (like everybody else) eagerly await the upcoming Half-Life titles. It is torture to make somebody wait so long for something so promising. To cut a review short, this game is amazing and it always will be. It is well worth the full retail price and so are it's expansions (even though Blue Shift is extremely short), so pick it up and you won't regret it. Period.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If I'm impressed by a 1998 game in 2015, surely this caused a lot of hype when it came out. Gameplay, story, music, and art are enough to make this game immersive despite the outdated graphics. I recommend it, and if you're deciding whether to buy this or the one on Source, there is very little difference between the two, except maybe the Source version has better water effects and shadows but it has some bugs that the original Half-Life doesn't.

My favorite game of all time, definitely worth checking out in spare time, you won't regret it!The levels are simple yet fun, the weapons available to you are heavily varied and each unique in their own way, with their own uses for different scenarios. You'll encounter many enemies in this game, and you'll be surprised at just how much detail there is in this game, I wish I would have been given the chance to have played this game earlier in my life.I'm not quite the writer, and certainly not a professional critic, but this game is incredible for how old it is.

												Half-Life... That name... No matter if you are a console gamer or just got into gaming and know nothing about the games out there, everyone has heard of or seen somewhere something about Half-Life. This is no wonder, released in 1998 and a true legend in the videogames history for being not only the turning point in Valve's fame and expansion towards creating Steam, developing the mighty Source engine and all other magnificent games they've made over the years, but also for being a thrilling FPS adventure which still fascinates gamers 17 years after the official release.The game manages to completely merge you with the character you are guiding, Gordon Freeman, through the massive Black Mesa venue. You are directly introduced into the action, no overwhelming storytelling, cutscenes or anything like that. By doing this, you get the complete feeling of being where Gordon is, without being rejected from the action as a mere spectator. The story is not at all overloaded with thousdands of plot twists to try to keep the action on. You are given a objective at points and you have to get through loads and loads of unexpected events on the way to your ""checkpoint"". That makes the gameplay action packed and, most importantly, dynamic.Probably the most impressive thing of the entire game is the incredibly imaginative and complex world in which the game goes on. It is huge (and I think that the word huge is too weak to describe its actual size) and, again, complex as hell. Your main struggle will in all likely be to find the way to the next stage as entrances are well hidden and nearly all of them require you to do something to open it. And yes, you'll need to use your imagination to figure out how to pass through an obstacle or open a locked door. The possible obstacles and their respective ways to overcome them are countless. The game also invites you to explore secret areas in which there may be utilities like weapons, ammo or a warmly welcomed health kit. All in all, the entire game will take around 20 hours to complete entirely.If I described the enemies you'll find through the game, I'd be spoiling the gameplay. Every enemy has his meaning to the storyline, ones more related than others, but generally it's not a bunch of NPCs randomly spawned here and there that you have to kill. As you go past the chapters, the enemies will change. Weapons and armor utilities are also fully connected to the stage you're at and are all completely different. You have three kinds of weapons: fire weapons, experimental weapons (Black Mesa is a research venue) and alien weapons (bit of a spoiler there, so be careful!). The stages through the game will take you to differently ambiented places in which you'll get the respective kind of weapon.Overall, there's not much more to say about this game. I could write the typical pros and cons summary at the end of the review, but it is hard to do. All I can say is that this is a must-have. It's a masterpiece of videogames. No other game, whatever the better graphics and all the new-gen stuff will be as good as this game is unless it pays the same attention to detail, imagination and creativity.10+/10			",81,10,13,2,6,1,3

												Mr.Gordan Freeman is just an average 27 year old man (which is somewhat half way through his life, which according to reliable sources is where the name of the game came from) who is late for work one cold Monday morning, as we all are from time to time. Today is once too often though and his employer is non too happy about his lack of time keeping.Upon his late arrival, Mr.Freeman (or as his friends call him, Chungus) finds himself in a bit of a pickle when he finds himself sent to the 'punishment chamber' to think about his inability to get to work on time. Unknown to his employers, Chungus is suffering from a midlife crisis and his recent inprisonment is all that is needed to push this mild mannered telemarketing assistant over the edge.As we see witness the hearthwrenching sight of a man slowly losing his grip on reality, Chungus stands up with his hands to the heavens screaming ""What do you mean I can't get to work on time!?!"". Picking up his crowbar friend, he breaks out of his prison with only one objective on his mind, to remind his boss why people don't like Mondays.Travel through photorealistic office enviroments as you make your way through endless hoards of enemies to reach your destination at the top of Black Mesa Office Supplies LTD. Evade medical officials as they try to help you with your diminishing grip on reality, plow through the lair of the Human Resourses department, dismember the legions of terrifying un-undead, take control of any piece of office equipment that could arguably be classed as a vehicle.Live through the sadness, the laughter, the action, the romance in this thrilling conclusion to the Half-Live quadrilogy as you fight for the promotion you deserve in this dog eat dog telemarketing adventure through the eyes of a man suffering from schizophrenia, hallucinations, drug withdrawal and a deep clinical depression from the loss of his pet Turtle, 'Simon'.""Not many things give me an erection these days but Mr.Freeman has such a supple pair of buttocks and ample breasts that no man could resist his charming personality.""* Gavichael Ramsey Jr - RT Magazine *""The game wouldn't close and task manager wouldn't open, so I didn't really have much choice in playing this""* Papa Het - Construction Worker *""Well yea, I guess it technically is a game""* Barry *10/10 Would be late for work again.

												""There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.”Half-Life is a legend among classic first-person shooter games. Map design and A.I. are still remarkable, and the story is better than most films. From the beginning to the end this game is a joy ride, that constantly confronts you with new challenges and weapons. And as already stated by the G-Man, prepare for unforeseen consequences.Fun fact: Black Mesa is a free game that will let you relive Half-Life with better graphics and other gameplay modifications, but without the alien world Xen.--My rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere-	Combat & Controls-	Details-	Tactical gameplay-	Characters-	StoryBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: S-Rank(Welcome to the HEV Mark IV protective system: for use in hazardous environment conditions. High-impact reactive armor: activated. Atmospheric contaminant sensors: activated. Vital sign monitoring: activated. Automatic medical systems: engaged. Defensive weapons selection system: activated.

While for the first time I needed almoust 15 hours, its awesome to know that you can speedrun this under 30 minutes for WR. In Hlaf-Life 1 antalogy there comes two more games - Blue Shift and Opposing Force. Whole event from two other characters point of view. These two games is worth playing aswell.

												A couple of tips.The crowbar will not be your best friend, it is only a tool to break boxes and glass.Be prepared for vents.If you hear, ""SECTOR SECURE"" or ""GO, RECON"" get your Magnum or Crossbow out.Snarks are a both your tool and possibly your demise.Play on Hard difficulty, give yourself a challenge. The Black Mesa security guards are usually useless. (There are many exceptions, but in combat, don't put your trust in them.)Don't waste your ammo on barnicles. You are playing the game that made Steam possible, you are playing a legendary game that had a huge impact on gaming.Have fun.Prepare for unforseen consequences. ",61,6,0,3,3,0,6

												A good classic but some of the sections drag on for too long and i wasn't fond of some of the level design and black mesa as a location is not the most fun to play through which is why i like half life 2 alot more because you were visiting so many locations with interesting visuals and great level design which is where this game lacks. It has a simplistic story expecially now in today's standards and the gunplay feels a bit dated now. It's not the masterpiece that it maybe once was back in the day. This is still a must play for any fan of fps games and i don't mean play it for 30 minutes and never touch again like most people do.7/10 (Good)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												This is the game that changed FPS games forever.  Before this, the story was a screen of text before a level started.  The storyline was not continued and told solely from the players first person perspective.  The levels were very well designed, the enemies you confronted were smart and varied and required a different approach.  The weapons were varied with secondary abilities.  The sound and music was top notch.  This may not be the prettiest game in the world by today's standard, but the quality of the gameplay from the shooting, to the platforming, to the characters you meet, you will not be disappointed that you got to play the classic game that forever changed the history of gaming and what could be done in a shooter.

												I was hesitant to get this or Black Mesa, but i wanted to play the two expansions as well so i went for the classic one. Most of the cool fun parts happen in the first two-thirds of the game, even before you get to Xen, which is just really annoying to play and get through. The last parts before Xen have you doing these mini mazes to turn on reactors and it wears down your patience.The first half is really enjoyable though, watching everything go to sh*t as you unleash the alien hordes on the Black Mesa research facility, and then later having to also fight through the army/marines sent to kill all of you scientists for some reason. If you haven't played it before you may get stuck at some parts as its not made clear where you have to go or what you have to do, ""oh i have to jump on this broken ledge and then jump to the other side and crawl into this tiny sewer/crevice, got ya""Graphically it's dated pretty badly, some of the textures may be the worst i've seen in a game,


Textures for days...

but then others look ok, so it's a mixed bag. If you haven't played it yet then you should, or play the Black Mesa unoffiicial remake with the updated visuals. That one's not finished though, it doesn't have the last Xen chapter....which just having replayed it may actually be a good thing :/ . Oh yeah and snooping round Gordon Freemans locker, he has a picture of a baby, he has a kid? so in number 2 the kid would be like 8 or 9 at that point?...... i mean he never mentions him/her but then the f*cker's mute, so who knows.

												Well, I finally got around to playing one of the most acclaimed and infuential games of all time.It still holds up really well and was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

												Half-Life is a cult classic FPS set in a facility called Black Mesa.You’re a theoretical physicist that for some unknown reason seems also very skillful with a lot of weapons. You and your team were making an experiment that accidentally created a dimensional rift in the spacetime, causing an invasion from creatures of the Xen dimension, but:What is the Xen dimension? Why are they invading Black Mesa? Who is Gordon Freeman?You’ll know some of these answers after you play the game and hell they were well worth it.If you can't stand the graphics, you're better off playing Black Mesa.★★★★☆ | Liked it ",1101,401,22,130,65,14,117

Groundbreaking. ♥Story:If you haven't played Half-Life, truth is - You're missing out on a very awesome story! Playing the role of Gordon Freeman, you must fight your way through numerous creatures from a planet named Xen, such as the Headcrab, Alien Controller, Alien Grunt, and many more! The atmosphere changes a-lot from time to time, bone-chilling, heart-wrenching, or just plain intense!You've got two enemies hopping onto your back in this game, The HECU & Xen, think about that. Getting shot at while having a Headcrab trying to jump on your head! There is also one giant mystery to this whole series, and that is - The G-Man, nothing is really known about this character, not even till this day! Countless theories have been made upon trying to crack the code as to why he's even there.Gameplay:For 1998, the gameplay is steady! Keep in mind that there are other games with steady game-play that came out in 1998, but this is Half-Life we're talking about! A wide variety of arsenal, Smg, Shotgun, Pistol, RPG, who CAN'T love that? I do admit, some of the physics are a bit off, such as sliding a box or jumping onto a box that has physics, it could throw you off! This game features moments where you could be caught or not, such as a helicopter flying over you while you're in a sewer tunnel, you could shoot & trigger enemies early or sneak past - It's the players choice and how they want to see the story as.Voice Acting:Let's be honest, most games around this time didn't have amazing voice acting, but I would give the Voice Acting in Half-Life 1 a pass. All the scientists sound the same, along with the security guards. But I could see why they'd re-use the same voice actor, budget-wise, etc. No further analysis needed for this section!Soundtrack:Oh boy, the soundtrack is very intense! Every track played during sequences definitely fit the tone of that particular scenery/scene! One of my favorites is ""Drums and Riffs"". The soundtrack is a mix between Ambient & Dark Industrial!Conclusion:All in all, this was my one of my first FPS's I've ever played, and I've played it on the PC & PS2! I love both versions equally, thank you so much VALVe for providing us with such an amazing series!10/10 ♥			",199,22,3,18,4,1,11

												Maybe Black Mesa... or how Gordon Freeman changed the world - a must-have, if you're not a graphic next-gen purist.During an experiment gone wrong, where you're the one that pushed the crystal into the analyzer, you're the only hope of the survivors to reach the search and rescue team, because of your combinaison. However, you'll have to survive from the attacks of your coworkers transformed in zombies and creatures coming from another world. And unfortunately for you, your only weapon is a crowbar. And you're just a scientist employed by Black Mesa...That's Half-Life for you. A scientist relying on a crowbar first before becoming an expert in weapons. The story is perhaps basic and with some twists but noneless, the universe build around Half-Life has expanded a lot.However, if Half-Life is a FPS, which means weapons to shoot any enemies, that you can carry thanks to your wonderful combinaison, you can find some puzzles throughout the game, mainly because of the need to wander around a destroyed facility.What's fascinating in Half-Life isn't probably the gameplay in itself. I mean, everything seems very basic. But if it wasn't for it, you wouldn't have mods like Counter-Strike around. I don't know why I was fascinated by Half-Life. I mean, it's not like jumping was new or that weapons were innovative... maybe the iconic crowbar has to do something with. Or maybe it's just that a plot, perhaps basic but very effective, the mysterious G-Man following you around and disappearing easily or that the fact it's someone that wasn't trained to become the hero of the world... or maybe the ending. I don't know but I just know that when I played it, I was fascinated.I was fascinated by the fact that you can find survivors around that can help you, guards or scientists. Or the fact that some of them meet a tragic fate under your eyes. I was fascinated by the change of the objectives: from reaching the surface, you're now the only hope to end an invasion and the wiping of any survivor by the soldiers.I don't remember any problem with the gameplay apart the treacherous ladders. Climbing them isn't hard. However, when you needed to step out of them OR going down, it was a challenge. And the famous jumping with the crates where you were sliding...Half-Life has the graphics from 1998 and it was very good ones. Even now, I could still enjoy them. I don't say that it's detailed. But you can see some interesting details. And Xen, the other world, despite being a challenge, is very beautiful.Besides, the soundtrack is also great. It's only heard during some important moments. But the music is powerful.Half-Life is a classic to have. Gordon Freeman is a character that you can't forget.			",852,759,11,38,65,8,71

												A 5/5 star classic, Half Life, a FPS FULL of action and suspense all about surviving an alien apocolapse and putting an end to it by going into space and confronting the boss responsible, if you haven't played HL1 yet this one is UNMISSABLE, go ahead and get a copy if you've never played it ""They're waiting for you Gordon, in the test chamber.""Onto more detail, was released in 1998 shortly before the PS2 era, from the talking suit you wear that protects you and warns you of danger, killing aliens, escorting fellow scientists and working together with security guards, you'd think your chances of survival are good? Well you're in for a surprise when you meet the military grunts, lets just say although they help exterminate the alien races they're not trying to get you or your co-workers and friends out alive. There's even a few areas in the game where stealth will give you an advantage weather it's surprising the unsuspecting with satchel charges or sneaking passed a blind and unkillable monster, being trapped in a shark cage fighting off an ichthyosaur (Terrifying creature) with a crossbow before you end up drowning and even killing the dreaded gargantua who's completely bullet-proof and 5 times your height.The ""cutscenes"" were a completely new thing in this game because they give you the freedom to walk around and do what you like as your co-workers are giving you information about the situation, if you're bored and want some fun you could try stirring up some trouble with them with some gunfire. This is definately a game worth playing if you're into surviving disasters and constant action, all I can say if you decide to go ahead and play it is ""Wisely done Mr Freeman!""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great classic and yet another must for all FPS lovers!This game pretty much pioneered with many things later found in a lot of FPS: ""mute"" protagonist, lots of weapons (classic and futuristic/alien), big variety of enemies/bosses and levels (even for today's standards), a bit of mystery/horror and an engaging story, left open for a sequel.After all those years and despite having been outdated by many modern games, it still holds up well today, you can see what made it great at the time!The game's ""man with a gun"" (or crowbar), the scientist Gordon Freeman, also became quite an iconic protagonist, boosting the belief that ""nerds can be cool too""!Some influences seem to have been taken from Wolfenstein 3D/Original Doom, though in their turn the latter games's sequels seem to have taken influences from Half-Life, showing how important all those games were for the FPS genre.The whole ""protagonist in a robotic suit, fighting a variety of aliens and marines"" plot, makes me think that Halo probably also got some influences from here.The addition of G-man as an antagonist, who watches your progress as you march further and further in the game and only those who pay attention will notice, was also great!Finally, if I had to name just a minor flaw that would be that I didn't find the music addictive enough, it seemed almost non-existent to me (Return to Castle Wolfenstein for example had a great soundtrack and totally immersed you in the game), but don't let this small factor drive you away from this gem of a game, you can't be considered a true FPS fan until you have played this!

You get sucked in, and you never want to leave. It feels so authentic. It's a first-person shooter at its core, with lots of puzzle-solving and some platforming. I'm not sure what it is exactly, but something about this game is just...perfect. You should definitely at least give this a try. Chances are, you'll love it as much as I do.			",37,4,1,6,5,0,3

												Half Life is a First Person Shooter that takes place in a hidden laboratory that experiments with teleportation. As you can guess things quickly go wrong and our protagonist Gordon Freeman must fight to survive. Gordon is an engineer but he is proficient with firearms and has no qualms about killing. He is a generic mute character with no personality and very little back-story. As is pretty much everyone you meet throughout this adventure. There are only three character models of scientists and one character model of the security guard rehashed throughout the game. It quickly makes you stop caring if they survive an encounter since you will surely meet the same exact guy again. I know it is from 1998 but it would have been better to make those three scientist models count and have actual characters in the game instead of meeting an endless clone of scientists throughout. The story is told during gameplay and there are no cutscenes which is nice. If you don't care about story you can just as easily whack the character talking instead of listening to them. There is no consequence for killing allies but sometimes they do lead to some extra loot or simply help you fight off aliens. It feels like a grand adventure since all the missions are seamless and connect together perfectly. Most of the areas early on are bland and gray but it is impressive how much variety there is in the actual objectives to get through them. It is never as simple as running and gunning, if something can go wrong it always does for poor Gordon.Which leads to my main problem with the game. The amount of platforming is kind of ridiculous and it  feels pretty awkward. They also demand too much precision as well as that annoying need to crouch jump to reach just a tiny bit higher so you can jump over certain objects. Another similar problem is that ladders are extremely unreliable and you never know if Gordon will hold on to it causing you to have to try over and over again. Luckily missing it is very rarely fatal although trying to go down one can be fatal as Gordon decides he has no need for ladders and that he can land a 30 ft fall. Quick saving is a godsend and makes these situations much more tolerable. The puzzles are never too complicated though the game can be inconsistent at times such as certain identical objects are not destructible but suddenly one is. Or just plain odd like them expecting you to figure out you can change tracks by shooting a sign during the railcart level.Actual gameplay fairs a lot better. You start off with a crowbar and quickly get a pistol which I used throughout the whole game since it has decent damage and is very accurate.  Most of the weapons are pretty standard like an assault rifle, shotgun and revolver but there are some pretty unique weapons late game. Some do share certain types of ammo like the assault rifle and the pistol. The assault rifle and shotgun are pretty inaccurate which makes sense considering Gordon is an engineer.  Gordon's main source of survival is some kind of special suit that takes the impact out of most damage and allows navigation through toxic hazards. For a while at least, Gordon does not wear a helmet for some reason and the toxicity will kill him eventually. The suit works pretty much the same as armor from any other FPS of the time and can be recharged by finding small glowing vials or through a wall mounted H.E.V center. The same goes for health, both first aid kits laying around and wall mounted health centers will heal you.Enemies in this game each have their own unique attack patterns and have pretty good AI. Most of the time humans will be your greatest foe since bullets are way too fast to dodge in this and they pull off impressive maneuvers at times such as when you chase them they drop a grenade behind them allowing them to regroup. The security guards yo can have follow you around are completely useless on the other hand. Most of the times they don't react until they get struck first and are only useful to distract the enemies. The game does steadily introduce new powerful enemies but you will be fighting mostly the same group of enemies from beginning to end. Aliens do look very weird and are not simply just humanoid enemies. Some enemies have weird death animations that play whenever they are dying so make sure to recognize them and not waste any ammo even though they are still moving.Overall Half Life is a pretty good game but don't let all the praise make you expect something amazing. There is no gripping story here nor is there even any characters aside from one mysterious man. Platforming in a FPS very rarely works and it sure as heck doesn't here. Still it is a solid title when it is not trying to be an Adventure game instead of a FPS. Half Life continue to be supported after all these years so it features modern controls and modern resolutions which is always nice. The physics like boxes floating on water and some puzzles solved by it are pretty fun to watch and neat. This is definitely a thinking mans shooter, you will be fighting your surroundings as much as shooting guns. If you can stomach all the forced platforming and want more in your FPS than shooting hordes of bad guys this is the game for you.			",1881,553,61,204,168,17,226

												Half-Life had a big impact on the gaming industry. Theres no denying that. Without Half-Life, the sequel which brought the Source Engine wouldn't exist. No Counter Strike. No Portal.But even ignoring what it brought to PC gaming, Half-Life is a great game on its own, with tons of rad weapons, an interesting soundtrack, and that good old-school charm.

In Half-Life you play as Gordon Freeman, one of the Black Mesa Research Facility's scientists. One of the experiments in the facility went horribly wrong, causing to open a rift between your dimension and an alien dimension, and you were unfortunate enough to be, in fact, the one that technically accidentaly caused it.    Now, stuck in the middle of this mess, your goal is to get out of the alien-infested facility, however, it may not be as simple as it at first seems, and aliens might not be the only enemies you will encounter on your way. The gameplay in this game is great and challenging. You can't run out guns blazing into enemies' faces here. You have to stay in cover, watch out for enemies trying to flank you and... well... shoot at them, of course. The soundtrack, while definetly more of the memorable ones, is unfortunately nothing special Except of Nuclear Mission Jam, it makes you cream your pants. However, music in this game doesn't play too often anyway, most of the time the only sounds you hear are footsteps and gunfire, so it does give this little special feeling when you do hear music. Graphics, while for today standards are bad, back when this game was released were good. Nothing really sensational, but they did hold up back then.   Game DEFINETLY worth buying. So now stop reading all those reviews, get your steam loaded with some $cash money$, buy this game and play it for Christ's sake.			",85,9,0,2,2,0,3

												If you're a gamer and have never heard the name Half-Life, I'm sorry to say that you're either overly sheltered, willfully ignorant or just too young. For those of us who enjoy First-Person Shooter [FPS] games, Half-Life was just as influential to the genre as Doom or Quake (for those of you who have never heard of these titles, Wikipedia is your friend). Classics such as Halo: Combat Evolved and newer titles such as Bioshock: Infinite have been influenced by this game, and older games such as Counter-Strike were mods of Half-Life. In short, the entire FPS genre has been creatively influenced by the atmosphere and style of Half-Life.                          - FYI: Final Score is at the end -- The Look - Half-Life was released by Valve (the parent company of Steam) in 1998 for the PC. As such, the graphics are abysmal by modern standards. If you are a nostalgic gamer such as myself, though, the low graphics can be humorous and even add to the charm of the game at times. There are numerous texture packs available if you cannot handle such old graphics.- The Story (Mild Spoiler Alert) - You're a government agent/scientist who gets involved with some experiments on unknown substances. Through testing these substances, you somehow open a portal and unleash an alien horde into the testing facility. You must then find and fight your way out of the facility. Pretty simple and straightforward-sounding. Half-Life was the first-ever game to tell its story completely through scripted sequences (events triggered by certain programmable requirements) and as such has no cutscenes. This is a very nice element to the game as you retain control of your character throughout the entire game.- The Sounds - For some reason, Valve decided they needed to make everything sound like it was coming from the inside of an echo chamber. There is a lot of reverb on just about every noise if you are not completely outdoors. Again, this is an element where modern technology has progressed as to make this appear foolish and unappealing. Give it some time before you make any judgments, though. The effect enhances the scariness of some situations, in my opinion. If you ever play any of the other Valve games (Portal, Team Fortress 2, Portal 2, etc.), you will discover that a LOT of sounds and music in those games originated from Half-Life.- The Movement - You run. You run a lot. You run really fast. You have the option to walk and the option to sneak, but 98% of the time you will be running. Sometimes, especially for unfamiliar novices to the game, the speed is too much and you end up running into an alien patrol before you realize that you just passed through that hallway. You will eventually get used to it, though. Half-Life was one of the first games (if not the first; I'm not sure) to implement the ""jump-crouch"" concept. If you jump and hold the crouch button, you can actually jump onto higher platforms. Instead of lowering your body, jump-crouching raises your legs and feet, giving you more clearance to vault onto objects.- The Combat - If an enemy sees you, they will throw a grenade. Expect to be spammed if you are spotted. Half-Life is a quick-save/quick-load supportive game; you can choose to disregard this if you want a ""purist"" experience. Enemies in this game are rather easy to defeat in the beginning and get harder as the game progresses, but each new type presents its own unique traits that make it hard to kill. The weapon switching system is confusing to a modern gamer at first; it requires you to scroll (or press hot-key) and then left-click to actually arm that weapon. The left shift button, by default, switches instantaneously back to the previous weapon used, allowing for a much faster switch. Weapons and ammo are decently plentiful if you are conservative enough.- The Mods and The Legacy - Half-Life is the number one most modded game of all time. There are more mods available for this game than any other, followed by Morrowind and Quake. The mods have spawned entire new game series, as in the case of Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Half-Life also holds the trophy for another gaming phenomenon: most-played for speedruns. If you are unfamiliar with a speedrun, the gist is that you attempt to start and finish the game as fast as possible.- The Downsides - Half-Life is an ancient piece of software by today's standards. With the advent of 2015, this game is now 17 years old (nearly old enough to purchase cigarettes!). Its age shows in many things. Several furniture items are completely cubic or square and have no roundness. Cockroaches are diamond-shaped. There are only three different models used for the human enemies and three for the friendly scientists. Each alien type has only one model/skin. The NPCs and enemies can get very repetitive at times, as such. Other than this, there aren't very many bad points to Half-Life. Its continued success and popularity speak for its quality and innovation.- The Conclusion - Half-Life is a classic in many gamers' opinions. I am of the same mindset. I completely recommend this game, despite its age and shortcomings, as a fun experience that will provide a decent challenge.Final Score: 10/10			",140,36,1,23,17,3,19

												É um ótimo FPS com uma ambientação e uma história bem interessantes. Você está no controle de Gordon Freeman, um físico que trabalha na Black Mesa Research Facility, onde são feitos diversos tipos de pesquisas. Freeman participa de um experimento que dá errado, criando um efeito cascata que ocasiona a invasão de aliens no local. Assim, ele precisa entender como reverter o incidente. O jogo tem diversos tipos de armas e de inimigos que, sem querer dar muito spoiler, não se limitam a extra-terrestres. A ação é o foco, mas não quer dizer que você não terá que parar e pensar um pouco em alguns momentos para resolver situações pontuais a fim de poder progredir. Uma facilidade que o jogo tem é poder salvá-lo a qualquer momento. Hoje em dia os gráficos não são tão atrativos, mas para a época de lançamento com certeza surpreenderam. A trilha sonora é quase inexistente, servindo para marcar apenas alguns momentos. Há mais de um final possível e um deles vai desenvolver os eventos em Half-Life 2. Então, se você tem interesse em shooters clássicos, não deixe de conferir Half-Life e de entender os detalhes de sua trama. E lembrando que existem mais duas histórias que se passam nas mesmas ocasiões, com personagens diferentes, em Half-Life Opposing Force e Half-Life Blue Shift.			",280,48,3,16,9,3,19

												That moment when barnacle pulled me out of water after fight with ichtyosaur in „Forget about Freeman!” chapter is – as for now – the closest moment in my almost-20-year life for getting a heart attack. I put into that creature whole magazine of Glock (even though I knew it dies after 4 hits), went few metres away and thought that I really can't play this game anymore. I had to turn it off. That „anymore” lasted about 4 days, then I sat again to Half-Life. Unfortunately, I didn't know how to pass teleport part in Lambda Core, scientist kept getting killed… Anyway, it was when I didn't know anything about HL. I knew only that it is the best game I've ever played. A couple of years later I made a Steam Account, bought HL Complete Pack, L4D2, L4D1 (which overpassed HL in best game ever played) and other games, but still Half-Life has reserved place on my HDD. Even if I'm not playing it now anyway, it deserves it. Great story, astonishing gameplay, thrilling, but not too scary overview.In nutshell: Not playing HL1 will be your biggest mistake as FPS player.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life 1 is a really nice game.It got released in 1998 and so it looks really old but it can be a lot of fun. Half-Life is a classic.You are a scientist called Gordon Freeman. One day you are involved in a critical test which goes terribly wrong and opens portals to the boarderland Xen. From that moment on, aliens invade earth and you find yourself in chaos and try to get out alive.The singleplayer was revolutionary at the time because it has a continious story without cutscenes. I also like that there are a lot of enemy-types. The weapons are all really balanced (except gluongun) and fun to use. The story develops as you proceed in the game. It gets more and more mysterious and suspense.In Half-Life you are mostly on your own and travel through many interessting environments. Sometimes the maps can be a bit confusing but in the end you will have a nice final and it feels great to finish the game.In my opinion Half-Life's multiplayer is very very good. I played it a very long time and it has a great learning-curve. In Half-Life you have very dynamic gameplay with fast movement, air-control, excessive wallbanging and spawnkilling. It can be a really great feel to dominate and control the whole map. In Half-Life you can play many styles.. aggressive like a berserker but also slow and silent. It's possible to break the enemies advantage by clever ambushing and by hitting well aimed headshots. Since there are many different weapons you can always find different ways to deal with your enemy. Each weapon is very different and good in special situations. Also the maps are all very different to each other. Each map has it's own great design and unique gameplay.Conclusion:I recommend you to try Half-Life on LAN with friends, because it's a lot of fun to play against enemies of equal skill. Since it has a great learning-curve you have to get into the game a bit.If you want to play online I recommend you to edit your config-file so you can have a field of view of 110 degrees and direct weapon-bindings. On most servers (Adrenaline Gamer Mod) you can use bunnyhop. Since they patched Half-Life you are no longer able to code bunnyhop-scripts in your config. So if you want a working bhop you have to use a macro programm like autohotkey or maybe your keyboard-driver. The other easier way to use bhop is to disable automatic updates and patch back half-life to an older version (still works online).Half-Life has a lot of mods and there is a lot of custom content (player and weapon-models, maps, effects and hud-elements). I recommend you to install good visible custom crosshairs and use simple explosion sprites.Regarding mods I can recommend you Adrenaline Gamer, Sven-Coop 3.0 (because it has the original Half-Life weapons and basicly is a coop mod for Half-Life), The Specialists (a Matrix-styled mod) and Frontline Force.There are also a lot great singleplayer mods. I can recommend you Half-Life Invasion, Escape from the Darkness, Paranoia, Todesangst, ETC 1 and 2, Sweet Half-Life and a lot more.Seriously there are a lot good mods out there..All in all for me this game is a must have. So if you don't mind the old graphics and take some time to understand the game.. I think you will like it!			",190,12,1,10,4,0,13

Half-Life is what made Valve what it is today, their very first product that went on to be praised by all. Its gameplay defined and influenced many FPS games that came to ensue.In Half-Life, players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a theoretical scientist who must fight his way out of a secret research installation known as the ""Black Mesa Research Facility"" in which experiments into teleportation technology turns deadly!A game that is one of the greatest and not to mention winning over 50 GOTYs and just being an amazing game in general.Good:-Crowbar!-Simple solid story-Very fun game!-Immersive and interactive environment-This is where the iconic FPS game Counter Strike originated.-Has a Guiness World Record XD-Half-Life's design helped revolutionise First Person Shooters-One of the scientists looks like Albert Einstein Bad:-Gameplay mechanics are accelerated and very sensitiveHighly inspired, Half-Life went above and beyond.  10 Foxes out of 10 Foxes.

												Half-Life is my old love so I found this review kind of hard to put together, since I had to put aside my nostalgia and deliberate precisely on what makes Half-Life an excellent game, but here goes my best.Half-Life is seemingly a classic FPS however back when It was released it was anything BUT, Half-Life was a frigging revolutionary game that defied FPS standards while still preserving what makes FPS fun and good. And Half-Life IS fun, Its got a wide and diverse range of weapons and enemies (as well as some cool bosses) and some brilliant AI that still impresses me today.But what really makes Half-Life a really stand out game is what it does that is different. Rather then going the way of a metal gear solid game valve opted for a really interesting minimal storytelling approach in which everything is witnessed through the gameplay, there are no cutscenes of any kind. The less is more approach works and instead of long pieces of poorly written dialogue the game lets you observe first hand the chaos and destruction in the aftermath of the Black Mesa Incident. It works and the atmosphere feels like the aftermath of some kind of horrible and ongoing disaster like a huricane or a Nuclear blast In which you must fight for your life throughout the game to escape.Rather than explain everything to you Half-Life will show you a lot of things or occasionaly say things that may confuse you. This is because you are just one man and its impossible for you to comprehend the big picture, you are small and insignificant in this grand scheme going on and while you get vague hints throughout the game as to this bigger picture the game leaves you guessing which gives the game a large sense of a forboding and sinister mystery .This game is built on atmosphere and while the graphics have aged a lot, it is still a breath taking experiance to witness the disaster and destruction of Black Mesa. The sounds and music are top notch and aid with this of course.If you are one of the few people who has not played Half-Life yet I really suggest that you get around to it, you wont just have fun but I think It will probably influence your opinion on how Video Game stories and atmosphere should be handled in relation to gameplay.

												I finally got the chance to buy & play this amazing game in the steam exploration sale so I'll try my best to explain this game in my point of view.Oh boy where to start well for starters this game is one of the main reasons Valve is highly respected & over 4 million gamers are still waiting for Half Life 3 including me, Gordon Freeman is a badass scientist that can fight off the military & a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of aliens, lots of weapons to choose from, the atmosphere is pretty spot on with the suspense of fighting off soldiers or just overall creepiness in Xen (the alien world), I could tell the game has had a lot of love because the game works fine on any PC & there's so many great things I can say about this game but I don't want to make an entire list of everything. G-man a.k.a Government Man (The slang is right here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Man_%28slang%29 if you don't know what it means) interests me because of his mysterious behaviour & everyone still wants to know if he fights for good or evil but some things in life can't be answered but I don't know if we could all handle the truth.... if you really want more questions added I would suggest this video it gives out some good theories on G-Man & many others you can watch on youtube.

			* SEASON 3 - EPISODE 12 * - Feat. MUTAHAR from SomeOrdinaryGamers !!! In this episode, xMulletMiKEx dives in to a pit of HALF-LIFE theories.		

The game has few minor bugs but the game still holds out as one of the grandfathers of the FPS genre & still popular for a 16 year old game so my final verdict is to get this game. Don't forget keep some head crabs as souvenirs on your grand adventures in Black Mesa, Freeman's grandkids might want it for their school project or for bragging rights on how cool their grandpa was back in his scientific glory. (If you feel like I missed something feel free to leave feedback)Bonus: This is a great video if you want G-Man & Nihilanth talked about at the same time

If you like the genre, and aren't turned off by antiquated graphics, then you have no good reason not to have played Half-Life. And if you do need a bit more frills, Black Mesa is an option.

												I was sitting inside a small monorail carriage. The underground transit system was huge. What was this place? A friendly female voice welcomed me. ""Good Morning, and welcome to the Black Mesa Transit system. This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of the Black Mesa research facility personnel. The time is 8:47 a.m., current topside temperature is 93 degrees with an estimated high of 105. The Black Mesa compound is maintained at a pleasant 68 degrees at all times. This train is inbound from level three dormitories to sector C test labs and control facilities. If your intended destination is a high security area beyond sector C, you will need to return to the central transit hub in sector G and board a high security train. If you have not yet submitted your identity to a retinal client system, you must report to Black Mesa personnel for processing before you will be permitted to enter the high security branch of the transit system. Due to the high toxicity of the materials routinely handled in the Black Mesa Compound, no smoking, eating, or drinking is permitted inside the transit system. Please keep your limbs in the train at all times. Do not attempt to open the doors until the train has come to a complete stop at the station platform. In the event of an emergency, passengers are to remain seated and await further instructions. If it is necessary to leave the train, disabled personnel should be evacuated first. Please, stay away from electrified rails and proceed to an emergency station until assistance arrives. A reminder that the Black Mesa hazard course decathlon will commence this evening at 19:00 hours, in the level 3 facility. The semi-finals will later be announced in the secure access train. Remember, more lives than your own may depend on your fitness. Do you have a friend or relative who would make a valuable addition to the Black Mesa team? Immediate openings are available in the areas of: materials handling, and low clearance security. Please contact Black mesa personnel if you would like to sponsor someone. If you have any education in the areas of theoretical physics, unusual technology, or other high-end disciplines, contacts the Black Mesa facility. A reminder to all personnel: Regular radiation and biohazard screenings are a requirement of continued employment in the Black Mesa Research Facility. Missing a scheduled analysis or check-up is grounds for immediate termination. If you feel you have been exposed to radioactive or other materials, contact your head of duties and contact your radiation safety officer immediately. Work safe, work smart, your future depends on it. Now arriving at sector C test labs and control facilities. Please stand back from the automated door, and wait for the security officer to confirm your identity. Before exiting the train, be sure to check you area for personal belongings. Thank you, and have a very safe and productive day.""  Finally, the ride came to a halt.The guard opened the door and I entered the administration centre. ""Morning, Mr. Freeman. Looks like you’re running late. ""And so it began.One of the best games ever made, a genre defining classic. An intriguing story/universe, the start of something 'special'.""With my brains and your brawn we'll make an excellent team.""I want to go back. Please Valve, let me go back to Black Mesa.10/10			",209,51,11,31,38,2,55

												Short version: good, but probably not as good as you've heard. Still get itLong version: It's a well-made game, and it's very clever in terms of the gameplay (i.e. boss fights are a bit more complicated than in most games, you have to think around the location of the fight, not the ""health"" of the boss persay). The graphics are as good as they need to be, they may seem a bit dated, but they're still good. Really, my only problem with this game is that it's very gimmicky and way overhyped (I could say the same about half-life 2). Is it a great shooter? yes. One of the best of it's era? Sure. The best shooter ever? God no! I personally enjoyed games like doom and Bioshock more, because they don't try to skirt around the fun of shooting things with how ""groundbreaking"" they are get in the way of their fun. General pros and Cons:Pros:+ It's a good shooter+ well-done setpieces that involve the player+ Great worldbuilding+ Good piece of gaming history+ Varied and interesting gamplayCons:- Slow paced- Unfair at times- Breeds a fanbase prone to overhyping itWorth the purchase on sale or bundled with the expansions			",74,13,1,14,14,0,9

												There is not much to say about this old game that hasn't been said really. Many people have played Half-Life 2 and the episodes, but sometimes there are those few who haven't really tried out the original Half-Life, along with it's expansions Blue Shift and Opposing Force. I also never played Half-Life, so I decided to try it out. Many mechanics are simialr to its sequel with many of the same guns, along with some other ones unique to this game. This game is an amazing experience from the begining to the end, despite the not as strong end levels, but still, it's a great shooter with great mechanics and gunplay, along with great level desgin not seen as much now in today's corridor shooters. The story is presented through the eyes of the silent Gordon Freeman the entire time, and despite the games old graphics, still makes the game incredibly immersive, even more so than many games today on the market. The expansions are also worth your time and are neccessary to purchase, and you can get a discount by buying the Half Life 1 Anthology. The only reason you would not play this is the simplistic graphics, but with people playing games like Minecraft, along with the greatness of this historic masterpiece, this is a must buy, and you should definitely be played BEFORE PLAYING HALF-LIFE 2 AND THE EPISODES. Anyway, I was just bored and had some time on my hands. So just remember, NEVER be late for work.			",31,5,0,1,1,0,1

												So what is Half-Life? Well it's got a simple story: You work in an underground research facility and some stuff goes wrong, unleashing aliens into the facility. You try and fight your way out to the surface but the military comes in with grunts and ninjas forcing you back undeground. There a team of scientists transports you to the alien homeworld where you kill an oversized fetus. This weird guy with a briefcase turns up and offers you a job. You accept and the game ends on a cliffhanger.Half-Life's gameplay is set up in a way that there are no cutscenes. You are in control of Gordon Freeman from beginning to end. It's this gameplay feature that makes this game special, makes it stand out from the crowd as a revolutuionary rollercoaster of epicness. It's not all combat though, sometimes you'll have to navigate puzzles and while that may turn off some players, they're not that bad. Most of the time there will be enemies to keeps you on your toes so be careful!This is my favourite game of all time, been playing it since I was a kid. I'd definetley recommend it to fans of FIrst-Person Shooters.10/10			",22,3,1,0,2,0,0

												There is not much to say about this old game that hasn't been said really. Many people have played Half-Life 2 and the episodes, but sometimes there are those few who haven't really tried out the original Half-Life, along with it's expansions Blue Shift and Opposing Force. I also never played Half-Life, so I decided to try it out. Many mechanics are simialr to its sequel with many of the same guns, along with some other ones unique to this game. This game is an amazing experience from the begining to the end, despite the not as strong end levels, but still, it's a great shooter with great mechanics and gunplay, along with great level desgin not seen as much now in today's corridor shooters. The story is presented through the eyes of the silent Gordon Freeman the entire time, and despite the games old graphics, still makes the game incredibly immersive, even more so than many games today on the market. The expansions are also worth your time and are neccessary to purchase, and you can get a discount by buying the Half Life 1 Anthology. The only reason you would not play this is the simplistic graphics, but with people playing games like Minecraft, along with the greatness of this historic masterpiece, this is a must buy, and you should definitely be played BEFORE PLAYING HALF-LIFE 2 AND THE EPISODES. Anyway, I was just bored and had some time on my hands. So just remember, NEVER be late for work.			",31,5,0,1,1,0,1

												So what is Half-Life? Well it's got a simple story: You work in an underground research facility and some stuff goes wrong, unleashing aliens into the facility. You try and fight your way out to the surface but the military comes in with grunts and ninjas forcing you back undeground. There a team of scientists transports you to the alien homeworld where you kill an oversized fetus. This weird guy with a briefcase turns up and offers you a job. You accept and the game ends on a cliffhanger.Half-Life's gameplay is set up in a way that there are no cutscenes. You are in control of Gordon Freeman from beginning to end. It's this gameplay feature that makes this game special, makes it stand out from the crowd as a revolutuionary rollercoaster of epicness. It's not all combat though, sometimes you'll have to navigate puzzles and while that may turn off some players, they're not that bad. Most of the time there will be enemies to keeps you on your toes so be careful!This is my favourite game of all time, been playing it since I was a kid. I'd definetley recommend it to fans of FIrst-Person Shooters.10/10			",22,3,1,0,2,0,0

												Half-Life is an amazing FPS experience released almost 20 years ago and that still hold strong today. The graphics will look dated to some, and the sound can be unbearable to others, but the story and the way the environment is layed out makes you realize how much work went into this (It must have been amazing to play this in 1998).The game is the classic shooter experience where you grind through waves of enemies, sometimes fighting a boss or one of the huge mobs that appear from time to time. The game is very hard, even at the lower difficulties (much harder than HL2) and is a good challenge for fans of old-school FPS classics such as Doom and Quake.I recommend any game from the Half-Life series because of the effort that went into making these games. If you really can't stand the graphics and sound, you can always check out Black Mesa, a remake of HL1 (it isn't completely done yet iirc).			",260,60,6,27,17,1,12

												This game is simply amazing for a game made in 1998. Its graphics are older, yes but it has been a challenging puzzle game. The storyline is also a bit easy to follow. The weapon selection is actually larger than Gmod or HL2 with up to ~15 weapons.The ending and opening scenes are also quite amazing. The only problem I found was controlling the long jump module, which is crouch-jumping. All-in-all, give it a go, its a remarkable and memorable game. 10/10			",43,7,0,5,3,1,1

												This is the FPS. Half-Life MADE the FPS type of game. For the 90s, it was very different. You werem't shot into a base on Mars, fighting every demon under the sun. You were a normal scientist who was at the wrong place at the wrong time. You, Gordon Freeman, must fight your way through a alien-infested under ground base called Black Mesa. Sounds boring, well its not. The wide range of aliens to fight and their amazing A.I will scare you!As for the FPS portion, its also great. You see everything from the eyes of Gordon Freeman. There is a reason you can take a lot of damage and why there is a HUD, your Hazardous Enviroment Vest (H.E.V) or better known as the H.E.V suit, protects you from a wide range of dangers. To freezing cold chambers to electricity-shooting aliens, it protects you. Giving a reason why you can take so much.The weapons are great! They're placed very well. You find the shotgun in a little base wich makes sence, you find the glock next to the dead body of a guard, etc... Also the ammo changes too! Depending on wich part of the base you are, the will be more or less of a ammo type, forcing you to use all your weapons in order to survive.As for the story, it makes so real sence...but its great. A huge amount of mass builds up, creating a portal between Earth and the border world, ZEN were aliens have been hiding from the Combine (as seen in Half-Life 2). They flee to Earth hence why the base is over run with aliens. The militery come to kill the aliens...and the survivors. Its a goverment cover-up and you're Black Mesa's best hope of cleaning the base of all aliens and soldiers.Over all: Buy it, you won't regret it...			",82,12,0,1,4,1,1

												By far the most intuitive and mind-blowing experience I've ever had in a shooter. Half-Life was easily the pinnacle of elite gaming and professional players. Iv'e never come across more talented players in my life than in this game. The single-player game is just as good with a great selection of weapons. If you don't own this game, or have you to play it, I can guarantee you will love it -10/10.			",138,0,1,0,3,2,11

												the original Half Life is an amazing singleplayer experience that revolutionized first person shooters and PC gaming. Though now considered a retro game, it still holds up as a fun adventure.PROS:-great pacing-awesome and creative weapons-memorable chapters and enemies (screw the military in this game)-simple controls to learn the hang ofCONS:-lots of slippery running and jumping. If you aren't use to pseudo-ice physics than you will not be able to control Freeman-bad voice acting and mediocre npc AIAll in all this is a fantastic game that every steam user should have the chance to play at some point. I have yet to experience Half Life 2 but hopefully it is as good if not better than the original.10/10 would doom the entire human race to play again			",27,6,0,2,1,0,11

												First off if your tired of FPS that are like COD, Battlefield, etc than Half-Life is the game for youPros:-Very original story (It is told through dialogue, and your always in the First-Person).-Excellent gameplay (HL's gameplay is a mixture of stealth at some sequences and all out guns blazing in others)-All elements to me are original-Cool protagonist-Pretty awesome weapons-Challenging enemies in well designed mapsCons:-Some minor glitches (like getting stuck on a wall which can be fixed by shooting your weapon) (This was all on my version, not sure if it will appear in yours)-Clunky platforming sections (There will be some parts of the game where platforming is required, and even if it looks like you can make the jump, you slip sometimes of the ledge).-No Half-Life 3Overall 9/10Half-Life is an excellent game, but some minor glitches and the platforming sections frustrated me a little.Half-Life is a masterpiece and not only do a recommend Half-Life 1, but buy Half-Life 1 Anthology and The Orange Box for Gordon Freeman's journey in fullNow stay tuned for my review of Half-Life: Opposing Force...

												Half-Life - a word used for stating the time it takes for a nuclear substance to reach half its original amount, but also - a great game!Released for Windows computers originally in November 19th, 1998, it came to redefine the era of modern first-person shooters. With a simple change in concept compared to other big games of the time, namely the fact that you never leave the players field of vision, the focus was always on the player, even during special events in the storyline. And the story - what a story it was and still is!In the game, you play as Gordon Freeman, an M.I.T graduate in Theoretical Physics, who is called to the Black Mesa Complex as a Research Associate for a large-scale experiment involving alien artifacts. Already from the get-go, you may pass your time by speaking to, or just listen to the conversations between scientists and security guards. You may interact with doors, buttons, microwaves, soda machines - I mean, what more can anyone ask for, right? I am not going to spoil the story for anyone interested in playing the game themselves (go play it already, if you haven't!), but I can say that the ability to interact with the surrounding world is something that the player learns to appreciate throughout the game. Because of this ability, there are often several ways to complete a certain task (moving boxes, blowing things up, pressing a switch so that you don't get caught by an electrified wire etc.). This is something that  works very well with the game's overall story and design.As the game progresses, Gordon comes face to face with stronger and stronger enemies who use different tactics to bring him down. Without ever uttering a word, Gordon swings his Crowbar (or perhaps his trusted shotgun) and plows them through, persevering through yet another life-threatening situation. It is just how badass he is (you are).Most of the times though, there is a lot of button-pushing in this game. Luckily, this is where the M.I.T-graduation comes in handy - for who could ever push a button the way M.I.T graduates can? Jokes aside though, he is darn fast at climbing ladders (while holding his crowbar with two hands - how does he do it?)!Personally, I really enjoy this game through and through. The Source engine allows for some slick movement and fast-paced gaming. If you take your time to listen to random scientists, you may or may not be surprised to hear that many of them are just as human as you and me. This is something that adds to the game and integrates the player further into the story, in my opinion. The story is great and the enemies have very advanced A.I for the time (1998, remember - that's 16 years ago!). I would recommend this game for every and any player who has ever played FPS-games, but even more so to any Quake, Doom or Unreal Tournament fans out there. So come on, give it a spin - it'll be worth it!			",48,1,0,0,0,0,0

												From playing and completing this game I can tell how this was a masterpiece in 1998. However, I'm reviewing this for the people like me who never played this game when they were younger. So I want to answer the question. Is this game still worth a buy and a play in 2015? So, a problem I seemed to have from the outset is that this game just assumes you know things, or you know the games concepts and mechanics already. There is never a tutorial of any type and in fact I got stuck for a solid 10 minutes at the very start of the game because I simply didn't know you could press ""e"" on people to make them follow you. Like, really? The game never told me I could do that. That is just one example of the game just assuming you know how to play.Secondly, if you really look at this game. In essence, it is a very repetitive shooter. You pretty much do the same thing throughout the whole game from the first hour to the tenth hour. It didn't make me bored, but I can imagine it might make some people very bored.Let me just add, THIS GAME IS HARD. Like, really really hard. I played on normal, and, oh my god. Just expect to die a lot. Over and over again to the same section, and throughout many sections in the entire game. It was at some points frustratingly difficult as I would find myself saving progress every 30 seconds at some points just because this try I did a little better and didn't lose too much health.HOWEVER, that is the gem in this game. Because it was so difficult. It made me so happy to finally get past sections and eventually complete the game. I actually felt a sense of achievement beating this. Like a ""I beat half life!!!"" That is what gaming should be all about and it's a shame most AAA games lack that these days.So, although this game has aged a lot, and elements are very outdated and in some circumstances, quite frankly, pretty awful. That doesn't take away from this game. This is a good game. I believe this game was enjoyable enough to still be worth a buy and play even in 2015.			",105,17,3,6,5,1,7

												I love this game to its core. Half-Life is one of my favourite games of all time. It's an excellent fps that does a fantastic job taking the player into it's world with a great selection of weapons, monsters and an overall outstanding atmosphere. It has aged quite ungracefully interms of graphics as the game was released way back in 1998 but the ai, music, atmosphere and gameplay still hold up very well. If you want to experience a fun, scary and action packed fps play this game! If I had any problems with it (not even things I find to be too much of a problem as I am a fanboy of this game) it would be that it may not always be clear to new players what exactly they should be doing in the story or overall goal. Alot of the more in depth stuff you will only find by searching up wikis about the story. It doesn't bother me but I can imagine it being confusing to newer players. It's told in a much more subtle fashion than some players might expect.This game also has a huge libary of mods and addons. Games like conterstrike, day of defeat, team fortress and others wouldn't exist today if it wasn't for this game. Developers are still creating mods for this 18 year old game which I find amazing. BTW if you're gonna play this game, play it in the dark alone. Half-Life is more of an experience than a game you play with your friends although it does have multiplayer in the form of deathmatch (and other mods such as sven coop) I find the best way of playing it and enjoying it a first time is to play alone.

												I am actually confused to why lots of people have not played this game, let alone played it to the end. If you have played Half Life 2 without playing this before you have made a huge mistake. The story is great, the gameplay is amazing with the amount of detail that went into the level designs, and you get to know the origins of nearly every source game made (Counter Strike, Hl2, etc). Play this game, you won't regret buying it.P.S Who buys HL2 just to play Garry's Mod, i see 10 minutes of half life gameplay and 100+ hours of DarkRP... That's dissapointing.			",79,7,0,10,9,0,3

												This game blew my mind.I played it since I was 6! The storyline combines puzzles, action and exploring in a perfect harmony which makes Half-Life one of the history's most important game. Still today it gives me a lot of gameplay. The multiplayer is absolutely worth a shot, especially during LAN's since on-line is not so very crowded and the people playing are veterans.

												It isnt really comparable to todays games, but I grew up with it and spent a lifetime on playing all its mods (there are still modders making games for Half Life and good still played mods like SvenCoop).Until today it has THE best player controls, making it easy to run, jump, speedrun and climb. Todays ""better"" animations often make you stuck on map elements, disrupting jumps, let you get stuck on ladders (♥♥♥♥ Half Life 2) or let you fell down a cliff, ignoring the jump button like Fallout 3 and Skyrim.Half Life is one of the old Kings of modern PC gaming and 3D shooters.

												The game is a perpetual maze; leaving the player to work at tasks that involve being locked into battle and overall puzzle solving to advance through the many challenges that wait up ahead. Most of the time, the story illuminates the puzzles by the actions to proceed, such as maze scenarios and building boxes to use as staircases. Although Half-Life has short-lived loading screens from time to time after leaving a certain area for a new one, the game has no levels. But, to make up for this traditional concept, the game is split into a number of mind-boggling chapters filled with rich story and easy adaptability.To start off with this game's story, you're none other than Gordon Freeman. A young man who holds a Ph.D in theoretical physics who starts his daily grind back at the Black Mesa Research Facility; a fictional complex that is stranded in a remote desert located in the suburbs of New Mexico. Arriving late for work yet again, you take the tram system around the Black Mesa Research Facility and at this point, objectives that his game has fulfilled such as breath-taking visuals and movie quality animation begins to blossom. The tram sequence at the beginning of the game can only be summed up in one word; Incredible. It's as if the things that come flying at you from every angle and position, almost reminiscent of watching an action-packed movie, along with the credits of the producer's names proudly fading in and out on the corner of the screen.As you make your first step in the heavily secured facility, you're constantly reminded that you put on your Hazardous Environmental suit, or the H.E.V suit for short. While all things are hunky-dory, those things soon turn to the worst very soon. After a failed experiment, involving a collision between a rare intergalactic specimen from another dimension with an Anti-Mass Spectrometer, the Black Mesa facility falls in ruins, meaning you are one of the only key survivors of the infamous ''Black Mesa Incident''. And with this, alien life-forms from the dimension of ''Xen'' are pulled from their dimension into ours and are running amok the ruined facility, along with the Army that storm the place after the gone, haywired facility's emergency call has been echoed. This of course doesn't make things any easier and you soon find yourself battling both the aliens and the military.While there isn't exactly much to complain about, I would admit that guiding the chickened-out scientists and professors around the facility can be quite a pain now and again due to some seldom poor AI programming, as well as the alien life-form, Vortigaunt, from which you would have to wait and be patient for them to wreck down wooden doors in front of you, as you are not capable of doing that yourself. (You do start off with a crowbar, right?) As well as I'm probably not the only one who made the same mistake by killing them through a small opening, before they did in fact begin to tear down the doors. But then again, this is where the used scripted intermissions started to show, so that's an added bonus to the magnitude of the game.Final Decision: 8.5/10			",163,8,1,20,4,3,4

												Despite its age, Half-Life is still one of the greatest examples of organic storytelling in video games. Valve’s debut title succeeds where most modern games fail—in telling a story without interrupting the game’s pacing or forcing its narrative down the player’s throat.In fact, the only time Half-Life interrupts it’s frenetic pace is to spoon feed you simplistic puzzles designed to showcase Valve’s fancy 'GoldSrc' engine, and while I’m sure it all looked fantastic back in 1998, it’s lost its relevance, and the frequent interruptions to the game are totally arbitrary now that we’ve seen things like physics engines become commonplace.Despite technological shortcomings, the way Half-Life tells a story is better than any that came before it and most that came after it. It’s subtle and understated, favouring brief snippets of dialogue between a pair of marines or a brief set piece of a scientist being dragged into an air duct over lengthy cutscenes of exploding helicopters. It gives an air of realism contrary to the game’s sci-fi setting and sometimes over-the-top tone, and it’s a real testament to the value of organic exposition that such evocative atmospheres can be created through such subtle methods.Surprisingly, Half-Life doesn’t let itself be carried by its storytelling. The narrative is built around solid core gameplay that boasts the tactical complexity of a more modern title on top of the large array of weapons reminiscent of older shooters. As I’ve previously mentioned, the enemy AI is subpar by today’s standards, but it’s really the level design that makes the combat stand out. The environments are varied and engaging in such a way that retains atmospheric consistency while providing some excellent combat scenarios.Half-Life will always be a classic, and despite some janky behaviour that’s become more evident as its aged, it’s a fantastic shooter—easily one of the best to date.

 Half-Life What is there to say about this game? Well actually, alot. This game is absolutely fantastic. Personally, I prefer it over 2. Anyways, with my opinion out of the way, I'm going to elaborate about why this game is so  great.  The story starts with you, Gordon Freeman. The 27 year old scientist with a degree in Theoretical Physics. Not much to say about that. Your workplace, Black Mesa, gets attacked by various aliens and the marines when an transfer goes wrong. The thing about this game is that theres a huge element of surprise. You'll find out what I mean when you play the game. Yea.Plot twists, man.Anyways, the gameplay. That makes the whole game. The gameplay is absolutely fantastic for an FPS. However, this isn't just any FPS with some macho guy ripping monster heads off because it's fun (I'm looking at you, Duke Nukem.)This is, what I would call an action-adventure FPS. This game really set the standard for the genre. There's a fair assortment of weapons. Speaking of weapons, you're going to need ammo. Alot of it.That's not necessarily a bad thing - it's everywhere. Or atleast, it's not very hard to find ammo. The other thing with this game is that, you, the player needs to be very patient. This game has backtracking. Alot of it. Next thing, the graphics. The graphics aged fairly well, in my opinion. Sure, some of the models might look wonky, but it can be easily fixed with a few HD mods. There is music in this game. Although, they only really play during intense parts, it's still quite well composed.If you look past the backtracking and constant dying, you'll love this game. Trust me.It's absolutely fantastic, and really set the standards for the FPS genre after 1998. That's not all I have to say about Half-Life, but if I did, you and I would be here all day. Final Verdict:9.5/10 An absolute fantabulous masterpiece  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You are Gordon Freeman. A scientist who works for the Black Mesa facility. And an experiment you took part in has gone completely awry, unleashing an extraterestrial invasion, and now all hell has broken loose in Black Mesa. Your main goal is to survive and to stop the invasion, using the help of surviving Black Mesa employees, whatever you can get your hands on and your own bare wits.Even if it is over a decade old, Half Life has aged very, very well. In fact it seems to do some things better than most Modern shooters - you can hold a heck of a lot of weapons for example, a great feature that barely has any presence in shooters nowadays. The gunplay is intense but fair, and you have a huge multitude of weapons to utilise - and they are all great and feel powerful. Enemy types are plentiful, varied and can get pretty darn tough as the game progresses. The enemy AI itself is intelligent and fierce - especially the soldiers who know how to flank well and work together. There are friendly NPC's as well, which are actually helpful: Security guards can help deliver covering fire and scientists can unlock doors and heal you if you are low on health. The game also takes good advantage of the environmental elements around it, technically making almost everything a threat or obstacle - some bridges can be destroyed which may require you to find another way around it, wet floors are obviously slippy so you need to be careful not to slide into an elevator shaft - Did I also mention that elevators in this game are barely ever safe? All of these great uses of particular stage elements called for some fantastically designed levels and puzzles that require a skilled gamer to complete.Graphically, I will admit the game does look a bit blocky by today's standards and the character animations are pretty wooden, but each level within Half Life looks worlds apart from one another, especially the last part of the game, trust me, it's amazing, that's all I'm saying about it, I'm not gonna spoil it. The character and enemy designs themselves, most notably the aliens, are really creative, unique and varied. The real time cutscenes were cutting edge back in the day and even though the choppy and kinda unexistant character animations during these cutscenes are now dated in a sense, the fact that they are REAL TIME just makes them very immersive and makes you feel part of a great story.When it comes to audio, the soundeffects are great and fits Half Life's sci-fi tone, and the guns are LOUD. The music tracks, although few and far between, are fantastic and give off great atmosphere. The voiceacting is also great, even if the recordings are a bit grainy.If there was anything I thought that did detract from the overall quality from the game, is the fact that sometimes the player can get glitched in certain parts of the environment, so they can't move, therefore they would need to restart from the last save... but then again this barely ever happens.Tl;dr Half Life is a groundbreaking FPS that has stood the test of time and I still consider it as one of the best shooters ever made, if not the best. An immersive, action packed, incredibly varied FPS that makes you feel like an action hero. Highly recommended to anyone who has at least an interest in videogames.			",87,5,0,1,4,1,2

And Xen aliens aren't only one that want to kill you. Army is also sent to Black Mesa to kill any survivors of resonance cascade. Can you save the Earth? You need to kill a monster called Nihilanth.

												The first time I came in contact with Half-Life was around 1999, I used to watch my brother play this game, to say the least I was amazed by the graphics and HL world back then. Some time later I started to play the game myself, as a real noob, I was pretty bad at it, occasionally playing multiplayer with my brother and friends, I was usually the worst of them (having the worst score). As time passed and I started to play CS 1.6, then HL2 and CSS, gradually getting better and better at every aspect of the game. Becoming a CSS regular, I became familiar with CS mods (DR, MG, ZM, BHOP...), having a few thousand hours in CSS.Today, replaying the first Half-Life I came to realize how much of an impact this game had on the whole series, inspiring most of the mods known to todays Counter-Strike community.Beside a very interesting story line, it has a diverse world, completely voiced dialog, awesome weapons and monsters and a legendary status in my book.no less than a 10/10			",44,0,1,8,3,0,6

												A masterpiece. One of the best first person shooters ever made IMO.The game's highest point is easily its immersion, almost unrivaled even until today, gripping you with its atmosphere and actually putting you in the shoes of a (sort of) Average Joe, who's unlucky enough to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. No cutscenes, no quick time events, no regenerating health, no objective markers cluttering up the screen or excessive handholding, no annoying constant remarks by the protagonist (tbh some games can do a talking protag right, but in this game I feel that a silent protag was perfect for it and used really well), and you're almost never taken away control of Freeman. This all combines with a great setting oozing with atmosphere, memorable enemies such as the headcrab, scripted events that are done in a very natural way to give life to the game world and that trigger often as you explore a space in an organic fashion, lots of environmental storytelling that rewards the player for sticking around to search and listen but doesn't force them to stop, and excellent level design with enough searching and nooks and crannies to explore to not give the feeling of being on rails that other linear games give. It really lets you live and experience the game, not just watch it like a semi-interactive movie as so many modern first person shooters now do.From a more gameplay-wise perspective, the weapons are rather fun to use and enemy AI is surprisingly still decent to this day and age, especially the amazing marine AI. You amass a very large arsenal of around 14 weapons, none feeling superfluous or excessively powerful and all surprisingly balanced and functional, each with their own situational ups and downs. No regenerating health naturally encourages you to be on the move and explore, in search of health packs and health stations (this is definately something you want in an FPS, as instead of the stale taking cover all the time to regen health of other games, you're encouraged to play far more dynamically and actually go out there, move and dodge, scavenge and explore). Movement isn't perfect, it can at times be too sensitive, but the speed but definately far faster and more fluid than the average CoD running speed that feels like you have bowling balls for feet.Cons? Well, if I had to point out problems with the game, then probably the Xen levels, aka the final few levels of the game. The physics in those levels are horrible and really frustrating, the level designs are bad and not fun to play through, and it's mostly a rather disappointing and frustrating last stretch of levels in an otherwise masterpiece game.Overall, 9.5/10, without Xen it would be 10/10, and either way it's a must play for any FPS fan.

												This is the game that started it all.The thing is,it still holds up;I spent hours and hours playing and replaying this game for the different kinds of actual challenges it offers.You can go up against crazy bosses AND skirmishes with lots of little guys,navigate the terrain and some of the fights with really good twitch reflexes and learning how the level works,old-school arcade style,plus,while it isn't a puzzler,you really do have to think about your environment and figure out how to use it to survive.When they talk about""a workout for your whole brain derp derp""in anything,this is kind of using your whole gaming brain,and it's satisfying.You kind of forget how polygonal and 1990s the graphics are with how richly the world is imagined,and you really do get a sense of Gordon Freeman as a lone,lucky survivor who evolves into a BAMF by natural selection.I do want to say,it's very different from the HL2 games;those are more talky and give us a less isolated Gordon.While you don't get the gravity gun in this game,I found myself wishing for some of the cool weapons available in this game in HL2.I will venture to say that you can't really call yourself an FPS player until you've played HL1.;-)			",56,45,0,6,12,0,8

												This game should be played by anyone who consider himself a PC gamer. This total classic built the base for a lot of modern shooters. It has a great story and graphics for the time, some characters are funny as hell and the gameplay is phenomenal. It has an unparalleled replayability because of the endless places to play online with a lot of people that still play it, and dozens of free mods here on Steam and elsewhere, which are whole new different experiences (basically different games with their story). The soundtrack is atmospheric and its a variety of weapons, from a crowbar to a rocket launcher keep you interested. Classic cutscenes and memorable levels. Wait for a steam sale and grab it! It deserves your attention. 9/10  Nominated for the “Test of Time” Award			",1894,804,82,266,263,37,336

												Half-Life is a science fiction first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation, the company's first game product and the first in the Half-Life series. Released in 1998 by Sierra Studios , in Half-Life, you assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who must fight his way out of a secret underground research facility whose research and experiments into teleportation technology have gone disastrously wrong. Half-Life is a first-person shooter that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game. Compared to most first-person shooters of the time, which relied on cut-scene intermissions to detail their plotlines, Half-Life‍ '​s story is told entirely by means of scripted sequences, keeping you in control of the first-person viewpoint. In line with this, the game has no cut-scenes, and you rarely loses the ability to control Gordon, who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game; the player sees ""through his eyes"" for the entire length of the game. It also has multiplayer and because this is not the original version, it comes with an HD texture pack, which looks gorgeous in game. Although having not played on an actual servers I have played LAN with one of my friends and in my first experience I thought it was spot on, there are so much maps and also many weapons for you to use. Overall I would give Half-Life a rating of 9/10 stars, for a 1998 game this is absolutely fantastic . The story is very interesting and fun to play through, you feel like you really are playing as Gordon this is an absolutely must buy for a price of $6 you are getting such a great deal. I am absolutely 100% sure without a doubt that Half-Life will just blow you away!.			",211,18,1,20,8,2,27

												ENGDo I recommend this game? Absolutely. It's a great game. And yes, maybe it's graphics have aged a bit, but then so has System Shock's. Whether it's on sale or not, I would recommend it to just about anyone, so here are some pros and cons.Plus-Great music and sound effects. They might be aged like the graphics but they still got it.-Takes the silent protagonist to a whole new level. You'll really feel like you are Gordon Freeman - even if you're a bit mute.-The game has some choices that actually give you different endings for a little variety (not that they carry over to other games).-Despite being a FPS/Survival type game, Half-Life has a godd story that is felt consistently throughout the game.-Balanced gameplay and various difficulties for those of varying confidence.-Unique enemies and weapons.minus-The graphics and sound might not always age well, but this is easily countered by nostalgia.-Though you can go about your journey in varying ways, it is, to an extent, very linear with little real choices. So if branching, choice-driven storylines are your thing, then this is a con. If not, ignore this.So that's it from me. Not much I can say wrong about this game. And in my opinion, the cons were a bit of a stretch. So what are you waiting for? Get the game! Or wait for a sale...THEN get the game!			",32,1,0,2,3,0,1

												around the time this game was released there were two types of video game story types. There was The Doom style, you know that stuff you mistake for credits in between blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. There was MGS, which felt the need to beat you with exposition until you began to feel like you were a Horse. who was dying. But narrative, true narrative, is not blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up or exposition. It is what half life does. Storytelling through gameplay. It is not a simple shooting gallery, nor is it a movie where you have to do♥♥♥♥♥♥to get past the commercials. It is a game where gameplay and story are inseperable. Half-Life would be dull as a film. And what would it be without the G-Man? I had never played this game before, but I had heard of it. everyone has. It is considered the best of 90's PC gaming(well, it and Deus Ex.) It nails gameplay and storytelling. the tale is compelling, with action, suspense, and a hidden element of mystery.			",119,14,0,20,6,0,16

												It all started with Counter Strike. When I barely knew anything about FPS games on PC. When I was only familiar with Survival Horror games as tank controlled models in 3d environments. Until I played Counter strike with a couple of friends. Some friendships were lost and others were born from that game. A couple of LAN parties later, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to click on ""Play Half Life"" Thinking it was a demo for an upcoming multiplayer shooter. I did not know what was in store. I don't think anyone was ready for what Half Life offered, really. I need to emphasize on the fact that throughout my very first 5 to 6 hours, I still thought it was a demo. Headcrabs, crowbars, bleeding scientists running amok, these images still flash before me until today. It feels like yesterday when I tried to pass through the hallway only to get sucked up by a pod infested thing. I think the scariest moment for me was fighting that huge boss from afar, I cant recall his name but the whole experience with Half life was haunting. Only 2 games did I play as a kid where I was literally walking step by step. One was Silent Hill 2, the other was Half Life. By today you should already know what Half Life represents and what it influenced. If you haven't played it, I don't need to tell you what you need to do.			",358,230,0,55,7,3,27

												So...this is what all the commotion is about....yes I know I'm late to the party by several years....hahahahaSingle player is great, if I were playing it on release date, which is apparently in 1998 or at least somewhere around there. Mutilplayer seems to be dead, I can see one server in Australia that appears to be alive but no one playing on it....there are other servers overseas but I can't stand playing with 300+ ping...But still not bad in this era, like lots of interesting little interaction with objects that some of these newer games don't have. I also like how when you blow a body up, the body parts go flying in bits and pieces, unlike some of these newer games where you blow something up and they just go flying as a whole(or nothing happens).... It's got an interesting storyline I guess. Those aliens remind me of the flood from Halo....hahaha Yeah overal, I suppose I liked it.===========================Played on ""The Beast""i7-3970x, 64GB RAM, 2x GTX 770s 4GB VRAM, WinXP x64 Pro, 4x SSDs, 2x HDDs, Rampage IV Extreme, X-Fi Titanium Fatal1ty Pro, custom water loop, 2x BD-drives, TJ07-BW, 850W PSU, and many fans!

												This game is amazing.  Although hard at times, I enjoyed nearly every bit of this game... all 17 hours of it.  Yup, that's right, it took me 17 hours to complete this game, start to finish, all while heavily relying on a guide.The thing is, older games tend to be a bit harder; ever heard of the term ""Nintendo hard?""  Although the modes are linear (not complaining there), often I would think I have gotten lost because of how big the world is, but I then found out I was going in the right direction the entire time, or I would quickly find the right direction.  So that's a nice effect.But for the most part, this game was years ahead of it's time, with dynamic shields, AI, and all sorts of enemies.You would think this is horror, but this is the older generation, based off of arena-based shooters (Quake and Doom), so your movement takes that aspect away (once I was able to jump off a cliff to dodge an electric LoS attack, then airstrafe back onto the cliff to take him out).All in all, this is a fun, fast-paced shooter that I would recommend to anyone.

												around the time this game was released there were two types of video game story types. There was The Doom style, you know that stuff you mistake for credits in between blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. There was MGS, which felt the need to beat you with exposition until you began to feel like you were a Horse. who was dying. But narrative, true narrative, is not blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up or exposition. It is what half life does. Storytelling through gameplay. It is not a simple shooting gallery, nor is it a movie where you have to do♥♥♥♥♥♥to get past the commercials. It is a game where gameplay and story are inseperable. Half-Life would be dull as a film. And what would it be without the G-Man? I had never played this game before, but I had heard of it. everyone has. It is considered the best of 90's PC gaming(well, it and Deus Ex.) It nails gameplay and storytelling. the tale is compelling, with action, suspense, and a hidden element of mystery.			",119,14,0,20,6,0,16

												It's really hard to say something about Half-Life that hasn't already been said before. The game has been showered with such praise and acclaim since it's inception, even in the modern day. While many people would be ready to just write it off as people looking at it through 'nostalgia goggles', it's really important to go back and look at what makes it such a masterpiece.Half-Life begins in a way that no other shooter at the time had done. Instead of leading off with a mission briefing before throwing you into a room full of demons, or showing you a cutscene to serve as exposition, the game immediately puts you in the shoes of Dr. Gordon Freeman on his fated tram ride as he is late to work. Your control of Freeman is, well, free, and you're free to move about the tram and examine the surroundings of your tram. You, the player, help Freeman get into his HEV Suit, greet his colleagues, and push a specimen of crystal into a large machine which promptly wrecks the facility of Black Mesa. Gordon, with your aid, sets out on an epic quest to escape his workplace, fighting off freakish aliens and later on soldiers who are sent in to perform a cover-up operation. Only in one instance is direct control ever taken away from you and even then you see the event unfold through Freeman's eyes. Story isn't told to you via exposition, but rather by carefully placed scripted events and NPC's you can encounter who inform you of where to go next.Half-Life's story, or rather the way it tells it's story still manages to be as immersive as it was when I first played it, way back in 2009. Gordon isn't some lunkheaded badass space marine who rips and tears the guts of his enemies but rather a normal person who just happens to be donning a powerful suit of experimental armor that prevents him from the same type of swift deaths that his co-workers are so subjected to. Black Mesa isn't a laid out level filled with awkward enemy traps that forces you to run around looking for arbitrary keycards to progress but rather a research facility that feels real and legitimate to go through, and it's still one of the most believable enviroments in a shooter today. The way the enemies interact with their environment makes them feel like actual living beings.Of course, all of this wouldn't be anywhere near as good if the gameplay wasn't there as well. Thankfully, the combat in Half-Life is as visceral as other FPS games of it's time, featuring a wide array of weapons with meaty sound effects. Gordon's first weapon is his Iconic crowbar, which you wont be using so much as a weapon later on and more of as a 'hand' so to speak, it'll be the weapon you use to smash apart the environment to see what is and what isn't breakable, or to smash open a crate to gain supplies. Your ranged arsenal is very diverse, featuring basic weapons like a Submachine Gun, a Shotgun, and a Revolver to the Tau cannon, something akin to a wind up rail gun from quake, to a tranqulizer dart crossbow that you'll primarily be using to fight off underwater and aerial threats.The weapons themselves are great but what makes them so fun to use is the fact that the enemies are just as diverse and require different strategies to take down. Something like a headcrab should be killed with the crowbar or the glock so as to not waste ammo, but faster, stronger moving targets like the HECU marines will be more easily dispatched with weapons like the MP5 or the Spas-12. You'll even come accross a giant hulking alien which is imperveous to all types of damage except for explosions. The sound designs on all the enemies is spot on, with the HECU sounding suitably intimidating over the radio comms, or the eerie roars of the Gargantua. This already solid gameplay is also helped by various other factors, like level design. I already mentioned that Black Mesa feels like a real place, and so the Level Design is often in close quarters, with enemies often hiding around corners and enemies like the HECU marines will take advantage of the various routes they can take to flank you, just as you are able to do the same. The game also features in my opinion one of the best VGM soundtracks out there, with songs like ""Diabolical Adrenaline Guitar"", ""Nuclear Mission Jam"", and the Credits theme standing out as some of my favorites in particular. When the soundtrack wants you to feel like a badass, it will, and when it wants to be atmospheric, it will. Valve's sound team was absolutely on point here, as the game and it's various sound effects, quotes and music all feel spot on.Half-Life isn't without a few flaws here and there though.  The game slows down towards the middle, with two chapters On a Rail and Residue Processing feeling a little tedious to play through, and with the final levels of Xen outside of the final boss being incredibly annoying and un-fun to play through. It seems like there was some pact between FPS devs of the time to make the final levels of their games to be as stupid as possible, but even then I really don't think these are enough to truly hurt the game. Half-Life is remembered so fondly not just because of itself as a game, but also the way it revolutionized the Genre. So many other FPS games tried to follow in it's wake, and it still remains one of the most influential FPS games of all time.Half-Life is without a doubt one of my personal favorite games of all time, as well in my opinion being worthy of being called one of the best games of all time. Half-Life is a game that combines an unbroken narrative with kick♥♥♥♥♥gameplay, strong and realistic level design with a rockin' soundtrack to create one of the most celebrated games ever created. I didn't even touch upon the huge collection of high-quality free mods available for the game, but they absolutely exist. They Hunger, Afraid of Monsters and Poke646 stand out as some of my favorite mods for any game. Half-Life is absolutely worth your time and money, and you owe it to yourself to play it if you consider yourself a video game enthusiast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have not played this game, then you have never experienced life. This is the finest work of art in storytelling and visuals you will get in your entire life. Half Life comes from a time where effort in games was a thing, and Valve created this symphony in such a perfect form, to allow the game of the century to be born. The game has aged fantastically, the visuals are intense and intriguing, and keep a surprisingly realistic feel for the limited hardware at the time, 1997-1998. It's amazingly natural to be immersed into this game.Pros - Everything in this game is pleasure at its most pure.Cons - Why the bloody hell don't you own Half Life?!Rating - 1,000,000/10(I have a low amount of hours since my Steam account is relatively new as of 2016. I primarily played the disc version of Half Life as well as the Playstation 2 version, while owning the Steam version since 2013 on a different account.			",33,0,3,2,1,0,0

												This game is a classic. It doesn't matter if I recommend it or not, you should probably at least try it.As most of you know, you are Gordon Freeman, scientist or something from Black Mesa and you basically save the ♥♥♥♥ing world. This first-person shooter combines a wide variety of weapons - Assault rifles, SMGs, pistols, grenades and crowbars with an amazing story and perfectly crafted levels. I understand why this game is regarded as a classic, the levels are truly made beautifully.Aside from being a great single player game, it also spawned a lot of community made mods, which were later created into standalone games. Popular ones like Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic and even Ricochet all started from Half-Life.To be honest, though, with the amount of praise it gets, I somehow expected a lot more, even though I knew it's an old game and I was a bit disappointed. Movement also felt a bit slippery.Overall, It's definitely not a bad idea to buy it.			",160,12,2,33,8,1,5

												All the new age shooters (otherwise known as would-be games) seem to be coming out with a little less flare each time these days so there is only one thing left for me to do; masturb… I mean play old shooters. In Half Life you play silent protagonist number B. He differs from others because he has the power of the beard and a MIT degree that obviously had no concept of oral presentations. When it was released Half Life posed a new stage of interactive storytelling. But really it just means you’re allowed to turn away from all major plot points and stare at the wall. Still, the notion of alien invasions and government cover-ups are very popular themes as my good friend, Fox Mulder, will tell you. Instead I saw Half Life as the story of the nerds overpowering the jocks and saving the world that we desperately needed.Half Life went down in history as an amazing game and the introduction of raging, hormone filled teenagers to the gaming scene via the mod Counter Strike. A spine chiller looked at in comparison to Hitler nowadays. I found myself playing through Half Life many times in the small fraction of my life I have experienced (This joke would have been better if I could say half my life) and I still have one question. Why is Gordon Freeman a hero when, during my play throughs, the scientists he is supposed to be saving served him better as meat shields? A question as mysterious to me as the G-man. Last time I was called the G-man followed the statement “you hit the spot,” during several of my ‘biology’ practices. And no, those didn’t occur at MIT.			",149,27,0,13,16,0,9

												Don't let the old graphics or old date fool you...this is hands down one of the best games ever made, sparking not only the hugely succesfful Half-Life series but also the Portal series. Not your usual shoot-'em-up, this game isn't for trigger-happy seven year olds who settle their disputes with digital figures because they're too weak in real life. No, this game invovles a lot of the thinking involved in Portal (although on a much smaller scale)--there's no objective dot like in Call of Duty. Definitely a must buy. And the multiplayer, however cheesy it may seem, is simply incredible. I never knew how accurate hip-firing could be...(Buy it and you'll see what I mean).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has been legendary since it's release in 1998, it has won over 50 game of the year of awards. If you have a pc of any kind, get this game. Because the story is good, it runs on a potato, there is fast-paced fun multiplayer, supports mods that make the game way better, and the whole game is fun.And if you don't have another reason for half-life then heres this: Half-Life SDK. The ultimate tool to putting your ideas from pen to paper, to a three-dimensional world that supports 32-bit coloured textures, ambient sounds that is really immersive, a top-notch visibility engine so everymap you play in is optimized for your pc, and aswell as high-poly models that can be created. Half-Life SDK WILL be in your LIBRARY-TOOLS folder upon buying Half-Life, for only 10 dollars.And in courtesy of Mapcore.org and Game Bannana, you can download maps to enhance your experience, or why not install a mod where you play as another black mesa employee, trying to escape the HECU marines aswell as the Xen creatures.I will never regret purchasing this game, it has filled me with experiences that I can always relive with a click of the blue PLAY button that sits in your library as you are bored and want to play a fun game. Buy this game, I don't care if your broke, get a small loan from the mafia or get a big one from the bank, just buy it.10/10 -ShoXiN			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing.  Although hard at times, I enjoyed nearly every bit of this game... all 17 hours of it.  Yup, that's right, it took me 17 hours to complete this game, start to finish, all while heavily relying on a guide.The thing is, older games tend to be a bit harder; ever heard of the term ""Nintendo hard?""  Although the modes are linear (not complaining there), often I would think I have gotten lost because of how big the world is, but I then found out I was going in the right direction the entire time, or I would quickly find the right direction.  So that's a nice effect.But for the most part, this game was years ahead of it's time, with dynamic shields, AI, and all sorts of enemies.You would think this is horror, but this is the older generation, based off of arena-based shooters (Quake and Doom), so your movement takes that aspect away (once I was able to jump off a cliff to dodge an electric LoS attack, then airstrafe back onto the cliff to take him out).All in all, this is a fun, fast-paced shooter that I would recommend to anyone.

												So...this is what all the commotion is about....yes I know I'm late to the party by several years....hahahahaSingle player is great, if I were playing it on release date, which is apparently in 1998 or at least somewhere around there. Mutilplayer seems to be dead, I can see one server in Australia that appears to be alive but no one playing on it....there are other servers overseas but I can't stand playing with 300+ ping...But still not bad in this era, like lots of interesting little interaction with objects that some of these newer games don't have. I also like how when you blow a body up, the body parts go flying in bits and pieces, unlike some of these newer games where you blow something up and they just go flying as a whole(or nothing happens).... It's got an interesting storyline I guess. Those aliens remind me of the flood from Halo....hahaha Yeah overal, I suppose I liked it.===========================Played on ""The Beast""i7-3970x, 64GB RAM, 2x GTX 770s 4GB VRAM, WinXP x64 Pro, 4x SSDs, 2x HDDs, Rampage IV Extreme, X-Fi Titanium Fatal1ty Pro, custom water loop, 2x BD-drives, TJ07-BW, 850W PSU, and many fans!

												This game is a classic. It doesn't matter if I recommend it or not, you should probably at least try it.As most of you know, you are Gordon Freeman, scientist or something from Black Mesa and you basically save the ♥♥♥♥ing world. This first-person shooter combines a wide variety of weapons - Assault rifles, SMGs, pistols, grenades and crowbars with an amazing story and perfectly crafted levels. I understand why this game is regarded as a classic, the levels are truly made beautifully.Aside from being a great single player game, it also spawned a lot of community made mods, which were later created into standalone games. Popular ones like Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic and even Ricochet all started from Half-Life.To be honest, though, with the amount of praise it gets, I somehow expected a lot more, even though I knew it's an old game and I was a bit disappointed. Movement also felt a bit slippery.Overall, It's definitely not a bad idea to buy it.			",160,12,2,33,8,1,5

												Half-Life is quite possibly one of the most important first-person shooters ever created. You're not a space marine: you're a scientist fighting for your life. You truly feel alone when your only companion--be it a scientist or one of the many security guards trapped with you--bites the dust, leaving you to fend for yourself. Seamlessly flowing from cinematics to action, there are no cutscenes: the control is never taken from you. Your journey through Black Mesa begins.			",83,12,0,19,2,0,2

I can't tell you how many times I felt like I was actually Gordon Freeman, fighting creatures in Black Mesa!

												I give this game a 8.5/10 overall. -The ""story"" is great even there is lack of information. The story is that a experiment goes wrong which opens a portal and aliens destroy the whole facility, the player needs to kill aliens and close the portal to save the day.-The gamplay is for me 7.5/10 because sometimes the directions are unclear and what you need to do is sometimes hard to understand. For example I got to a area which had many enemies and very little health packs, I found myself frustrated dying over and over again. in the same area a npc got stuck in a door and he needed to help me open a door (where health packs and ammo was found in), I had to consult a online guide to understand what I needed to do. Sometimes I got stuck in objects and sometimes the game crashed.-The graphics are ""bad"" (by todays standards) but dosent affect the gameplay, I really didnt notice the fact that they are ""bad"" and still enjoyed the game.-Otherwise I think the game is great and I highly recommend it to people a great game.

Only dislike is a certain enemy weapon that has homing round that will follow you down a hallway and around multiple corners. I streamed this on hard, the difficulty mechanics weren't too bad. It didn't make enemies SUPER spongey. All around good game that changed FPS's in a big possitive way when it came out. I definitely recommend grabbing the series!			",142,5,1,10,6,0,11

												This game is a masterpiece. I'm pretty sure I'm not the first to say that, but it really feels like one. Many things in this game make it what it is. First, the gameplay in this game is just marvelous, you can't feel closer to the game with its amazing mechanisms, shooting, jumping and everything you can do, it just feels right. It seems like it's really you that controls the game and that the final result, good or bad, is always the product of your moves. With great shooting and movement mechanisms, everything feels right.Secondly, another thing you can't complain about this game: its story. The story of Half-Life, the one that gave birth to this amazing franchise, is just a beautiful piece of work. It fully accomplishes its mission to take you to another world. With the fact that, Gordon Freeman, the character which you control, is entirely in your possession feels like you are in this story and you have the power to change it. The game doesn't even have cutscenes so everything is seen from your point of view. The story is captivating; it treats the alien subject differently from most stories told on this subject. It contains a government trying to hide the alien-incident, a mysterious G-Man (the man who always watches you) and a chaotic man vs alien battlefield. Maybe after all, they're not what we thought... So many questions will fly around your head and will give you the desire to continue this mysterious story.Thirdly, I have to talk about the graphics and the level design. Those both, like everything I said before, are just truly great. While the graphics may be considered ""ugly"" or ""old"", they are for me still beautiful even if this game is from 1998. The game has great details, textures and colors. Just imagine how it felt back in the days. For the level design, nothing as changed. What I mean by that, is even after more than a decade, the levels are still pure genius and are so well used that you need to think and to familiarize with them so you can use them as your advantage. I have to tell you that this game isn't like most of the games today and is longer, which is really nice, because you'll want this game to never end. There is also a multiplayer mode which can be fun, but, as you guessed it, is mostly dead. From a negative point of view, I don't have a lot to say. For the people that won't like the graphics, you can always buy the Black Mesa game, which is the same thing, but updated for the new generations (or old time fans). All I can say in the end, is that this game is a must!			",355,91,8,29,33,3,39

												""Half-life (abbreviated t1⁄2) is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value. The term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo, or how long stable atoms survive, radioactive decay."" Developed by Valve in 1998, released by Sierra Studios for Microsoft Windows, Half-Life was Valve's debut product in what would become an iconic series. You assume the silent role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a young physicist who's late for work. After a teleportation experiment goes horribly wrong, lots of alien based death ensues.It's hard to ignore what Half-Life did for gaming as a whole. Much of PC gaming had become ominously quiet around that time whilst consoles enjoyed a surge in popularity. Then like a head crab from a dimensional fracture, this appeared.Though it can be considered a little janky by modern standards, there's still a lot of fun to be had fighting your way through the black mesa complex. Plus the game can run on a veritable potato.If you've never played this before, why?			",63,3,0,4,0,0,8

The gameplay is very good and fast and not boring at all, especially I am not a fan of FPS. But the game is definitely worth to play, All I didn't like was a very little ammo at the end made me to struggle big time and very poor audio, especially for talking. But apart from that I really enjoyed it playing almost every day until finished. Solid 8,5/10			",274,117,8,67,21,3,49

As you can imagine things go wrong quickly and Mr Freeman is forced to save earth from a terrible foe...The Good+ Excellent story+ Wide variety of foes+ Great assortment of weapons+ Intense firefights+ Smart platforming+ Graphics hold up well+ Active multiplayer+ ModsThe Bad- Navigation = It's easy to get lost when playing in these huge maps whith a lack of directional markers and map.- Limited setting = The course of the game features differeent areas around the Black Mesa compound.- No subtitles- Voice audio too lowSummaryOveral this is a great action-adventure game that should be played by half-life fans and any one who is interested in the genre.

												A very great game, an awesome story, a bit glitchy but runs well, I loved playing it and attempting to solve its puzzles and difficult areas. All in all, it was an outstanding game. I would strongly suggest Half Life Source over this one.The multiplayer is average, I would say that its not something to sink hundreds or even tens of hours.			",513,82,7,39,17,4,38

												Damn, this is the best shooter I've ever played. I don't have any nostalgia for this and I'm not even a big fan of shooters, but this game is so well made that I can't do anything but praise it. Sure it might not have aged that well visually but the atmosphere and uniqe look of the game shines through after all these years. The gameplay is what you might expect from a shooter, you shoot things with guns. However when it's combined with the amazing level design, varied and interesting enemies and the sense of isolation this game is rising above every shooter on the market by a mile.

												This game aged very well and was fun to pick up and play again. Not really too many glitches to speak of. Only dislike is a certain enemy weapon that has homing round that will follow you down a hallway and around multiple corners. I streamed this on hard, the difficulty mechanics weren't too bad. It didn't make enemies SUPER spongey. All around good game that changed FPS's in a big possitive way when it came out. I definitely recommend grabbing the series!			",142,5,1,10,6,0,11

												I give this game a 8.5/10 overall. -The ""story"" is great even there is lack of information. The story is that a experiment goes wrong which opens a portal and aliens destroy the whole facility, the player needs to kill aliens and close the portal to save the day.-The gamplay is for me 7.5/10 because sometimes the directions are unclear and what you need to do is sometimes hard to understand. For example I got to a area which had many enemies and very little health packs, I found myself frustrated dying over and over again. in the same area a npc got stuck in a door and he needed to help me open a door (where health packs and ammo was found in), I had to consult a online guide to understand what I needed to do. Sometimes I got stuck in objects and sometimes the game crashed.-The graphics are ""bad"" (by todays standards) but dosent affect the gameplay, I really didnt notice the fact that they are ""bad"" and still enjoyed the game.-Otherwise I think the game is great and I highly recommend it to people a great game.

												Half-life has a metascore of 96. It's that high for a reason. Half life is coming close to 2 decades old, and you can still have a good time playing the game. The mechanics and half-life engine are the reason we got games like Counter-Strike and Team Fortress Classic. Even today the mechanics leave the game fun to play (even though it takes me an unbelievable number of shots to kill those army guys, the hell is that armor made of?) and the level design ages even better than those.At this point, the game has been out for about 18 years. It's highly renowned as one of the best games of all time. If you're reading reviews wondering if you should get it, well just buy the damn game already.			",89,11,0,3,3,0,4

												While DOOM really established the FPS, it was Half-Life that really took it to the next level. Valve created something so amazing, so different to anything else on the market at the time. Not a straight up shooter, but one where you were actually IN a story. Events were happening around you, and you were participating in them. Enemies were not just wheeled out wave after wave, they were smarter. Things happened when you seemed to be walking down an empty corridor, nothing was straightforward in this game. Many features in Half-Life will now seem standard, but next to DOOM, this is the game that changed the FPS in to what it is today. But while playing DOOM might only provide you with some retro nostalgia for a few minutes, Half-Life is still a very playable classic.			",541,239,11,61,54,7,104

												This is probably the game that started it all. Without this amazing game there probably wouldn't be any mods that would later be owned by VALVe. I.e. Counter Strike is a mod for Half-Life. This game is actually the game that would change gaming forever, it's unique story, graphics, gameplay, puzzles, and of course its Multi-Player death match mode. I highly reconmend this game, cause it would be kinda sad to see anyone out there with a gaming Pc and not have this game installed, sure it's an old 18 year old game, but remeber this game made soo many mods, and along with it's 2004 sequal. I have fond memoires of playing this game when I was 4 and 5 years old and playing it on an old Windows 2000 with the CD.Edit : it's really a good game it will never get old despit it's age, it's still a better game than some new AAA titles today.

												Half-Life is quite possibly one of the most important first-person shooters ever created. You're not a space marine: you're a scientist fighting for your life. You truly feel alone when your only companion--be it a scientist or one of the many security guards trapped with you--bites the dust, leaving you to fend for yourself. Seamlessly flowing from cinematics to action, there are no cutscenes: the control is never taken from you. Your journey through Black Mesa begins.			",83,12,0,19,2,0,2

Yes, the graphics aren't as good as to it's succesor or any other game now, but let's remember that this was made in 1998 and is the first game Valve ever made. There is also another version called Half-Life: Source, which has slightly better graphics and works with G-Mod. It also comes with Half-Life: Deathmatch Source, too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first thing anybody is going to notice in this game is the graphics. They're very dated, and sit somewhere in between Playstation and Playstation 2, but don't let this turn you off from this classic. I originally bought this just to fill the gap in story before Half Life 2, but found it to be an extremely fun and intermittently terrifying old-school survival horror FPS. This comes complete with the ability to Friendly-fire on any civillian you wish and enemies you'll come to hate, placed so strategically as to force you to go away from the health pack you desperately need because you don't have enough health to face them in the first place.

												An excellent game in its own right. Valves first masterpiece which inspired the sequels (HL2, Ep 1 & 2) and countless mods throughout the series, such as the acclaimed Team Fortress 2 and Portal.The player starts of as a researcher in Black Mesa running late to work. After the Gordon Freeman, the character the player controls, reaches the test he is supposed to participate in he is immediately put to work. This has cataclysmic consequences, and Gordon Freeman is then forced to defend Black Mesa from an alien invasion and, eventually, the military, all the while being followed by the mysterious G-man.In terms of gameplay, Half-Life is very simple. You have health and suit power, a variety of guns and hopeully some aim. Starting with a crowbar and ending with a laser, you will shoot your way through Black Mesa, solving simple puzzles and navigating sometimes complex coridoors.The plot is simple yet effective, as is the gameplay. Overall, a very satisfying game, and worth checking out regardless of reviews, due to its impact.			",103,17,0,20,7,0,18

												Wow! Even after 18 years this game is amazing. I haven't played Half Life before but I heard everybody talking about it that it was one of the best titles the have ever played. Well from now on... I'm part of this group of people! Can't even imagine how much hype this game had to have back in 98. Still looks great and the atmosphere is fantastic! Moreover, 9 hours long campaign... If you are one of the player who like to play a game with a good story, well you should grab this one! Take it from a guy that has played Half Life 1 in 2016 for the first time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best FPS ever.  Its sequel, which is an excellent game, comes fairly close, but is it as good considering its era?  No.One can only hope the team that is remaking/has remade this classic thoroughly finishes up Black Mesa... maybe spice things up a bit in the chapter ""Surface Tension"", as well as everything else that has been acknowledged by people ect.  I applaud the product they already have released and would recommended that entirely, and at the time of this writing they have not finished it quite yet.  Black Mesa even in its current state enthralled this fan.  (edited for Jesus and the FCC).I guess by now you want me to talk about this game and not its remake.  Well, this is a very old game and the visuals are horrendous by todays standards.  A few aspects of the visuals perhaps are not too bad though considering its contemporaries, but it isn't nice looking and you will need to mod the game if possible to make it look nicer.  Still, you can play it in a more acceptable, modern high resolution on screens that some people wish they had back then.  You run around bashing boxes up with a crowbar in a bright orange high-tech suit that deflects 30mm bullets from an Apache, killing aliens, marines, and ninja CIA agents.. and sometimes a scientist or security guard on accident.The story is quite amazing though, and if you have played the sequel it might be very enjoyable for you even if you can't stand the graphics, at first.  I guess Ridley Scott wouldn't want to make a film based on it if the story was that lackluster.  But don't expect any biracial damsels to save you this time.Nevermind, my mistake, it is JJ Abrams I guess. Too bad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games ever made. There's really nothing to be said about this game other than that it's legendary. If you have not played this game before at least once in your life, you should be ashamed for calling yourself a ""gamer"". There is a free demo for it called Half-Life: Uplink. There, now you don't have an excuse to not play this game.There's also a huge modding community, where you will find mods that started entirely new franchises like Counter-Strike, Team Fortress (technically it was a Quake mod first, but got ported to Half-Life), and probably more.My Rating: 10/10Also we need a prequel.

												""Half-life (abbreviated t1⁄2) is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value. The term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo, or how long stable atoms survive, radioactive decay."" Developed by Valve in 1998, released by Sierra Studios for Microsoft Windows, Half-Life was Valve's debut product in what would become an iconic series. You assume the silent role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a young physicist who's late for work. After a teleportation experiment goes horribly wrong, lots of alien based death ensues.It's hard to ignore what Half-Life did for gaming as a whole. Much of PC gaming had become ominously quiet around that time whilst consoles enjoyed a surge in popularity. Then like a head crab from a dimensional fracture, this appeared.Though it can be considered a little janky by modern standards, there's still a lot of fun to be had fighting your way through the black mesa complex. Plus the game can run on a veritable potato.If you've never played this before, why?			",63,3,0,4,0,0,8

												Quake 2's younger brother that went on to throw valve into the lime lightWhile fast paced and simple, Half-Life comes off as a bore to me now that I've given it a good clean run through again. While it's story never breaks line from Gordon's perspective, they don't elaborate on any of the characters or enviroments at all, making interaction with scientists and guards either ""keep them alive"" or ""waste them for laughs"".Level design, however, is this games strong point. Every map is huge and expansive, with some great texture work for a game released in 1998. The Dam scene remains one of my favorite uses of Quake II engine technology to this day.It's basically Quake 2 in lab settings. The most interesting chapter is probably Xen, with it's bizarre landscapes.Multiplayer isn't horrible.7/10 it's good			",212,20,2,5,4,2,5

												Surely PC games were made before this, but PC games didn't truly exist until this was made. This is the messiah of PC gaming. Half-life is an amazing game. It defined storytelling in FPS games and probably other genres too. Its FPS combat was masterful. The graphics, while outdated in this day and age, were excellent for its time and are still comparatively excellent. It's a great combination of modern and futuristic warfare with militants and aliens. Well done Valve. Well done.			",306,103,32,44,40,2,54

												This is such a fun game even though it came out in 1998. But it does have its fair share of pros and cons.The main thing i loved about this game is the amont of variety in it, at one point you'll be fighting three gaint claws then hinding from a helicopter in a mine field, then fighting a huge fish underwater with a crossbow. You'll be faced with something new every time, which is somthing most games need to stay fun. Another great thing was the amount of different wepons you keep finding thoughout the entire game, so by the end you have somthing like 20 different wepons (with most of then having a right click secondary fire).The graphics in the game were terrible (but it was made in 1998 so thats ok). The level design was ok (but sometimes you crouch lower then you thought was posible). There is no sprint, only nomal, walk and crouch. The AI sucked, because they somtimes have too fast or too slow reactions, it's really hard to sneak up on them, they occasionly shoot at you before they've finished turning to face you, and some enemys kill you instantly (but your speed make up for most of these problems with the AI). I couldn't understand the plot most of the time (because there is no cut scenes) and the ending was a bit disappointing, it was slightly to sudden.Most of these problems were because it came out in 1998.Which doesn't matter because i loved the game7.5/10			",51,6,0,3,1,2,3

												i give this game : 9.6i was watching a video ( a game review ) by some one who was saying how good was counter strike and how bad was global offenssive, saying therse no improvement whatsoever, and after playing both game i agree with him.But we all know that half life is like the single player story mode of counter strike.They share the same engine, the same graphics, the same content, and the same ai and gameplay and son on and on...so i finished half life ! now the guy in the video was stating that no one knew why counter strike was good so no one could make it better which seemed right at the time.but after finishing half life i understood why counter strike (10/10) was so Good !!!If developers make a game and dont be concered about graphics and be concered about the LAW and MATH of EVERY SINGLE CONTENT that ever come to a game from code to its last detail and put all the assets on a similar scale a new counter strike will be REBORN !UPDATE : THIS HAS ALMOST HAPPENED AND ITS CALLED RAINBOW SIX SIEGE NOW !now to the game itself :i promise you even if u play this game RIGHT NOW u  will ENJOY THE HELL OUT OF IT.The game is old schooled , just the way i like it, its hard, you cant just press buttons to pass, you actually have to be a hero !And NO NO NO your character in game shouldnt be BATMAN or superman or glueman or any other crappy man for that matter, YOU THE PLAYER SHOULD BE THE HERO !The game test your skills, requires you to be smart and fast, give a nice story for its game and gameplay and year it was made.The graphics are old but due to lack of particles, which is a good thing, you wont tyre your eyes all the time to simulate an effect with no good use, you can play the game in long hours easily, and believe me it will require LONG hours to finish !if u play a little the game attracts you and you wouldnt mind the graphics anyway.But at first it will be a little odd, but i think there is a remastered in hd version on steam called black mesa, so you can play that too, but i had to experience the original thing first .This is the hardcore PC game you are looking for !i give this game : 9.6reviewed by IMMORTALEADER			",400,45,32,38,18,2,60

												EA really♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed with this one. Ever since the release of the greatest and first shooter video game ever, South Park: The Game, EA has been trying to dismantle the lead that Square Enix deservingly took with their masterpiece. It was apparent that EA took heavily from Square Enix's SP:TG (as us educated game critics call it) with the release of their lowest rated video game ever released, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, which is essentially SP:TG with a tower defense/RTS element haphazardly implemented. Half-Life may be the worst video game I've ever played, but it still holds a place in my heart. This game represents the downfall of EA, who had brought in the past relatively ok RPGs such as Glover, Alladin, and Space Channel 5: Part 2. Half-Life is the bottom line. Everyone should play this game, if only to steer clear of accidentally doing something that this game did if they plan on developing a game. There is no redeemable quality to be had here. 9/10			",57,5,0,6,3,0,1

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | 2 *3*] = ~88% (75%-100%)It was great back then when it came out, one of those ground-breaker games that showed us what could be done in a video game. A shooter where you're not actually constantly shooting but also experience some civilized situations, like e.g. at the beginning of Doom 3, allowing a much deeper sense of immersion and role-playing.HL is also one of the first 3D 1st person games to have scripted events. It was pretty revolutionary back then to see e.g. how a laser wandering around the room destroys equipment just when you're in the right place to witness it.Much love went into making this game. Sometimes I believe that the actual intention/attitude somehow reflects in a work, not just the craftsmanship. See also System Shock 2 - at least that's how I explain a good portion of its magic.If you want to play it today for the game instead of as an attempt to find out what the people back then might have experienced, play Black Mesa instead. It's a worthy remake of Half-Life.			",1053,464,26,127,134,10,138

												Half-Life is a FPS, but not a average FPS, this game brings in shooting and platforming at the right times, sometimes managing the jumping puzzles can be hard, even when the answer is in plain sight and hard to see, completing it feels satisfying. The game can be difficult espically at times when coming to some parts (unless your on easy) making that feel good when you complete it too. The soundtrack is a good part of this game too, and by good, I mean amazingly good. Some of my favorite songs in the game are the following: Hazardous Enviroments, Nuclear Mission Jam, Klaxon Beat, Diabolical Adrenaline Guitar, and Jungle Drums. Overall, being one of the best (and first!) Valve Software games ever, this game gets a 9/10.[EDIT 3/13/2015]Just to convince you even more how good this game is, i'm gonna list some mods for this game.CRACK-LIFEPlay through a skinned Half-Life game to make it feel like you're on crack.SVEN-COOPHave you ever wanted to play Half-Life or it's expansions with your friends?Well now you can with this mod!And not only do you get the campaign support, you also get custom maps too!Plus, you can play Crack-Life with it!I'll add more later.

												This game still holds as one of the best first person shooters, specially because of it's multiplayer. It hasn't aged that well, unlike it's successor. Glitches in the single player campaign can be very annoying, but if you like old games, you must play this. It's a very long game, has little focus on story, so the action is nonstop as you travel trough a lot of different environments, the gameplay never gets boring. And if you already played Black Mesa Source, I still recommend this just because of the multiplayer.The multiplayer is very unique and fun. The different kinds of alien weaponry and the possibility to use some of then to move and jump around makes it very hard to master. I always return to play it because the multiplayer on modern war games always bores me, trying to be realistic and balanced, while in Half-Life you just make a mess with ridiculously overpowered weapons and movement mechanics, it's fast, it's awesome. Half-Life 2 Deathmatch was just not the same in comparison. If Valve decides to make Half-Life 3's multiplayer just like the first game, with more maps, more overpowered alien weapons, faster movement, and a remake of the crossfire map, it will be the best multiplayer game ever, outselling all Call of Duty games combined.

												I honestly don't know why you're reading a review for Half-Life instead of buying it and all the other HL games, but anyway, since there are so many reviews already explaining why it's good, I'm just not gonna do that. Instead I'll just write the story of why I bought it, or mainly how I got into Steam Way back in 2012 when I was first introduced to the internet and memes, I had seen many Half Life 3 memes and I was curious as to why it was so popular, but I never bothered to research it and just went along with it. Eventually, in 2013, I created a Steam account (or maybe it was in late 2012) because of people talking about TF2 and I wanted to see what made it so great, so I downloaded TF2 and I didn't really understand how to play or what I was doing then I lost my login credentials to my Steam account and created 2 more before I finally got to this one. I didn't use Steam much at the time other than to play TF2 and I got my friends involved, too. After a while I went outside my TF2 bubble and started browsing games during a Christmas sale and bought 2 games that got a lot of attention on the internet as well, Fallout 3 and Skyrim. I played them almost 24/7 and then summer came and the 2014 summer sale started, but I had to miss out because I spent 2/3 of the summer away from home. When I came home I got back on Steam and then in August school started up, but that didn't stop me from browsing Steam and building a wishlist (I rarely got money at the time) and I found half-Life and all the other Half-Life games so I wishlisted them all. As time passed, my library grew, my wishlist shrunk, but the Half-Life games always stayed. Then, sometime in March I bought a $20 Steam wallet card and used it to buy a $10 game off my wishlist and I saved the rest for when I had more money to get a more expensive game. Then next week Lego games went on sale and I added another $5 to my account so I had $15, enough to get the Lego Batman trilogy (or at least one of the 2 I didn't own) but then I realized I could get the complete HL 1 anthology for $15 so I bought it, and played Half-Life then fell in love with the series			",178,28,1,19,18,0,6

												There's not really much I can say about a fifteen year-old game that hasn't already been said, but Half-Life still holds up as a fantastic first-person shooter. The game has aged wonderfully, playing as a great mixture of arena classics like Quake and more ""tactical"" shooters such as Battlefield or Call of Duty, along with (very hit or miss) light platforming elements and occasional puzzle-solving. In the realm of modern shooters, looking back to classics like Half-Life is a great way to get to better understand how gaming has evolved and how changed many elements of gaming have become over the years.

Spoiler alert, the giant baby at the end of the game is really ♥♥♥♥ing hard, so prepare for your balls to be crushed by the mighty iron fist of alien justice.			",128,15,2,21,3,1,10

												Half-Life is the ultimate alien shooter out there. With an awesome story, a cool arsenal of weapons and enemies, and a wonderful gameplay,  mixed with a very low price for this jewel, make it a must have for every single human being on Earth, or every single Vortigaunt on Xen, or every single Advisor in the Combine Overworld. Either way, being from whichever planet you are, you should play this game. And it has a lot of expansions and mods for it. Having Desura installed alongside your Steam client is highly recommended for this one, since it allows you to install a lot of mods with a single click. And if you can get the Half-Life complete pack, then better, because these games are the best of the best.			",697,171,26,80,62,9,120

												The legendary FPS that started it all! It is easily described with its memorable tagline, ""Run. Think. Shoot. Live."" Let us analyze it in depth, now, shall we?""Run"" - fast-paced action that slows only for puzzles""Think"" - use your brain for clever mind-benders well-integrated into the game's combat as well as strategizing what weapons to use""Shoot"" - self-explanatory. Excellent gunplay is excellent gunplay; not to mention each weapon is unique serving its own purpose.""Live"" - Add an ""A"" to the start of it, and that is how you will feel when you play this game thanks to the exceptional combination of everything above plus awesome sci-fi elements, story, soundtrack, and community-made modsEverything about this game is exceptional. I cannot emphasize how much you should try this game. Trust me, you won't be dissapointed.			",106,14,4,6,4,0,8

												Probably the first FPS to bring puzzles to another level (the beginning of the famous Valve puzzles). In Half-Life you play as a scientist instead of a badass soldier. Using diverse high tech equipment and the help of security guards and other scientists, you try to survive the huge black mesa complex. Released in 99 it still feels fresh with excellent character and level design, it's safe to say it was at least a decade in advance.			",218,26,0,17,5,0,12

I played Half-Life off steam and I could never stop replaying it just because the gameplay is fantastic and the story is nigh unopposed as one of the best story lines to date. If you consider yourself a gamer and haven't played any game in the Half-Life series you need to go sit in a corner and think about what about you've done with your life or pay a measley 10 bucks to experience the amazing experience keeping you from that true gamer status.

												The Beginning of the end. Or the start of a new Beginning? This is the original to the franchise that turned some heads. The original maybe dated as hell graphically but it still has its charm. Also if you do not want to play with the out dated graphics,then get Half Life : Source or download Black Mesa (Half Life remake mod). However Half life is not just about Half life if you get this original. It has tons and I mean tons of mods that people still actively play. Half Life Source does not have anywhere near the # of mods as this original.			",381,74,14,73,45,5,92

												Half-Life is one of those games that really stands out against a majority of titles. It's main goal is to immerse you into it's world and challenge you time after time again. Visuals - 10/10 For the 90's, beautifully atmospheric. Gameplay - 10/10 Fantastic gameplay, so enticing and hypnotic, you'll swear you'll forget who you were for a second. Story - 10/10 It's not that complex of a story, something goes wrong in the facility and you have to escape. However, complexity aside, it does manage to get a premise where you, as Gordon Freeman, do not understand everything that happens to you. Overall, recommended all the ♥♥♥♥ing way.

Half-Life introduced storytelling ideas that games still use today, and couples that with very solid shooting mechanics and great level design.  With new graphics and a better system for the (uncommon) box pushing physics, it could easily pass for a great modern game.  You should play through it if for no other reason than to experience history.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oke where do I start. First of all I thought this was a linear singleplayer fps game because I didn't know better after the likings of Call of Duty singleplayers. Oh boy was I wrong! You need to play this game more like Duke Nukem 3D. It's a shooter, platformer/puzzle all in one very neat package with a great story on it's own but even better in combination with Half-Life 2 (where's Half-Life 3?!). I feel dumb but I really needed a walkthrough for this game. Most of the things weren't that difficult as I discovered afterwards, but as a person playing the wrong games for a long time (looking at you again CoD!) I really didn't know what to do at certain points. So valve assumes you have something resembling a brain when playing this game. Shooting and guns feel great. Animations are good too. Only thing that feels old are the textures and models but what do you expect from a game this old? Of course being on PC offers great options like texture mods or even complete overhauls/standalones with Black Mesa being the most popular. Only thing is, the last part of the game is not ready for Black Mesa yet so that's why I didn't play that instead.Only thing I didn't sometimes like was the jumping. After a jump you seem to 'slip away' but maybe that's just me. Not really worth mentioning but sometimes It was frustrating to jump from one platform to another. If you want to rush a quick singleplayer game DO NOT play this game, this game is not for you. It's not the quick-fix singleplayer game you want to blast through in a couple mere hours. You need to relax and take time to play this jewel. And when you do, you will be rewarded a great experience that will change your look on singleplayers.PS: Go buy Half-Life 2 if you don't have it already! ",94,9,3,10,2,0,4

												There is no doubt in my mind. This is the best first-person-shooter there is. It's got great story, brilliant shooting and amazing level design. Buy this game if you are sick of the modern FPS genre. Buy this game if you are looking for a well crafted experience in general. Buy this game if you are a sewer rat reading this on a discarded iPhone. The only excuses for not buying this game now are already having the game, or being dead. JUST BUY IT!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm new to Steam and was extremely excited to find this masterpiece available. It was the first game I downloaded, in fact. I'm pleased to say that Half Life is just as good now as it was back in the late 90's when i first stepped through the door into the Black Mesa Research Facility. The compelling storyline; the immersiveness of the environment; so well crafted that it's still easy to see how this game defined a genre - and it still holds up today. I'll say no more about it, I know i'm preaching to the choir here, who doesnt love this game?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's refreshing to still be able to play and enjoy an old jewel like this game, and for those of you young enough not to know the importance of this game, back in its day this classic shooter revolutionized the industry. And now we can enjoy it once again understanding the game's age and that we can't possibly expect it to be on par with modern titles in terms of looks. I played the game through several playthroughs, and at the difficulty I played it, it was quite challenging with quite a few reloads to get it done. This quick save/reload cycle is pretty much an inherent part of how the game plays and it got VERY annoying with several instances me getting close to rage quit it. However the game always won me back no matter what! I encountered little bugs in my experience with it, and I didn't play it in my normal gaming rig but instead in a very crappy laptop. This was due to an idea I have that games from the pre-1080p era should be played in laptops so that they don't look too pixelated and the game played very smoothly with very little bugs.Conclusion: This game is a very nice retro experience, challenging to the point of making you rage quit, but with the power of winning you back after every cry of anger!!!!!!

												When this game first came out, it was, for many, the most awesome thing that could ever happen. Half-Life is a classic FPS and has a lot nostalgic value. The game which holds up even today.Good things in Half-Life:- Classic game which (most likely) every gamer has at least tried- Quite a long game, which just doesn't suddenly stop- It can be difficult but ain't nowhere near impossible and frustration- Good library of modsBad things in Half-Life:- Might not be a good choice if you are a bit younger and want a realistic-looking FPS. It's a old game with old graphics.- Enemy AI can be very stupid sometimes- There's not that many different enemiesI would recommend this for older gamers who have experience in old games. Also this game suits for those who seeks treasures from past.I wouldn't recommend this game for those who wants awesome new graphics and realistic physics.Points: 7 / 10 (..as a HL-fan I'll give 9.7/10)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a Milestone for FPS's, and Video Games in general. Although I prefer the Portal Series (and HL2 was far surperior to its predecessor), this game still deserves the praise it gets. I'll be honest, this game's controls haven't aged the best; everything is slippery and way too fast. But, with a game from '98, that is to be expected. Despite minor hiccups in the control department, everything else checks out: the graphics look great for the time and still look good today, the story is interesting (even if it's rarely explained), and it can be very challenging at times. Almost everyone has already played this game so me telling you to get it won't do much, but still I implore everyone who hasn't played this gem to pick it up ASAP.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can get how people would not like this game, with today's gameplay and graphics. Compared to COD and Battlefield, Half-Life seems a bit unrefined (particularly in movement, as you tend to slide... a lot). But, what Half-Life does have going for it is immersion and a story- both of which are very well-handled. You see things go on around you, that make it seem like you're actually a part of something so much bigger, and that you're actions can bring about some greater change. The ending, while vague, leaves me anticipating the second Half-Life, whenever I play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. I have no problem with old graphics or games but it seems to be a bit too dated for me to play, will probably pick up Black Mesa instead.Hooks you on the plot, world is immersive, weapons and world design unique. Very original and innovative for its day and age. However some of the levels appear to be broken, one specific area took me  at least 2 hours to beat because one of the in-game trams got stuck. Not unbeatable though without a walkthrough or some ingenuity.A problem is the game is so old it breaks when I close it so until I restart my computer steam acts as if It's still open, thus my 7 hours of gameplay is now 125+ hours, and preventing me from playing other steam games until I restart my system.Overall a good game. I recommend you grab the valve complete pack or the orange box instead of this on it's own though.9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Half-Life introduced storytelling ideas that games still use today, and couples that with very solid shooting mechanics and great level design.  With new graphics and a better system for the (uncommon) box pushing physics, it could easily pass for a great modern game.

												Oke where do I start. First of all I thought this was a linear singleplayer fps game because I didn't know better after the likings of Call of Duty singleplayers. Oh boy was I wrong! You need to play this game more like Duke Nukem 3D. It's a shooter, platformer/puzzle all in one very neat package with a great story on it's own but even better in combination with Half-Life 2 (where's Half-Life 3?!). I feel dumb but I really needed a walkthrough for this game. Most of the things weren't that difficult as I discovered afterwards, but as a person playing the wrong games for a long time (looking at you again CoD!) I really didn't know what to do at certain points. So valve assumes you have something resembling a brain when playing this game. Shooting and guns feel great. Animations are good too. Only thing that feels old are the textures and models but what do you expect from a game this old? Of course being on PC offers great options like texture mods or even complete overhauls/standalones with Black Mesa being the most popular. Only thing is, the last part of the game is not ready for Black Mesa yet so that's why I didn't play that instead.Only thing I didn't sometimes like was the jumping. After a jump you seem to 'slip away' but maybe that's just me. Not really worth mentioning but sometimes It was frustrating to jump from one platform to another. If you want to rush a quick singleplayer game DO NOT play this game, this game is not for you. It's not the quick-fix singleplayer game you want to blast through in a couple mere hours. You need to relax and take time to play this jewel. And when you do, you will be rewarded a great experience that will change your look on singleplayers.PS: Go buy Half-Life 2 if you don't have it already! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best thing happened to me back in 2004, it was the year that the PC game Half-Life entered my life. I remember playing the demo, Half-Life: Uplink and going crazy for it. So, what did I think of the full game?It blew my F**KING mind! Mere words are insufficient to describe how freaking AWESOME this game was (and still is). I shall however attempt to do just that.The story is excellent. You begin as Gordon Freeman, a scientist in a secret laboratory complex called Black Mesa. The suspense builds as you make your way to the test labs and then, once there, it all goes horribly wrong. Your world is thrown upside down. Black Mesa has suffered a catastrophic system failure. Your friends and colleagues are dead or dying. It seems you are trapped far underground. But worse is yet to come.Combat is good and fun seeing enemies gibbed by your explosives. There is a lot to explore. The facility is vast, although not every door can be opened. Music is good and fits into the location of Black Mesa and the level you are on. Enemies are varied and vary in ability. Each section/level has its own theme and look, along with its own challenges.Half-Life was helped back in the day by the hundreds of mods that gamers made, enhancing and extending the Black Mesa complex. With them, the game seemed to last forever, which is no bad thing.The game comes with multiplayer and I must say was an absolute delight to be involved in. I spent many hours with my friends competing and having much fun in the process. I actually became rather good at it, if I do say so myself.After over 15 years the graphics obviously shows its age but in all honesty, who cares? I don't. It's actually one of the reasons I love the game and have such fond memories of it. Most of the character models look and sound the same, so making out who is who is almost impossible, which shows in the sequel.There may be Half-Life II and Black Mesa, which are graphically superior but if not already done so, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you play this game. You shall not be disappointed.10/10 (for its time)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When this game was release I was just turning 2, so I never got to play it.I've played for almost 10 hours so far and loved every second of it, you're always doing something; I haven't experienced any boring sections yet, every section has something to do, enemies to kill, somewhat puzzle-ish scenarios, or an objective you must figure out.The game gives you information from generic scientist surviors you meet, security personell (which you can also request that they help you fight, although the AI for them is terrible by today's standards, they can prove useful at times) and what seems to a army loudspeaker. Other times you figure it out on your own. Graphically it's nothing compared to today's standards but Valve has made HD textures, which are on by default. You can also get another out there on the internet although it may not be worth your time. There isn't anything that is going to improve the visuals drastically, but honestly the game is fine without, it's still very playable and it's in no way going to hinder your enjoyment.Gameplay is enjoyable and satisfying, the simple first person gunplay is great; pick up ammo, shoot, reload and stand behind cover, and reload whenever you can. Shooting alien crabs and those who they have taken over is relativley easy but a lot of fun. Shooting soldiers is a huge amount of fun, and it's where you have to think more about what you are doing and use the more varied weapons you have in your arsenal; they can be simple hand guns, revolvers, machine guns, shot guns, cross bows, grenades, etc.It's an enjoyable classic game, you shouldn't miss this out in your life. Come on, get it, and play it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Here's some guns, now shoot each other"".You can buy this because of the amazing mod support.Because Action Half-Life, The Specialists, and Sven Co-Op are all still a blast, and making maps is really fun if you're the kind of person who gets creative in the presence of limitation.You can buy this because it's one of PC gaming's gems.Because it's as amazing now as it was in '99.Any reason is a valid reason to have Half-Life in your library.

												Great game. I have no problem with old graphics or games but it seems to be a bit too dated for me to play, will probably pick up Black Mesa instead.Hooks you on the plot, world is immersive, weapons and world design unique. Very original and innovative for its day and age. However some of the levels appear to be broken, one specific area took me  at least 2 hours to beat because one of the in-game trams got stuck. Not unbeatable though without a walkthrough or some ingenuity.A problem is the game is so old it breaks when I close it so until I restart my computer steam acts as if It's still open, thus my 7 hours of gameplay is now 125+ hours, and preventing me from playing other steam games until I restart my system.Overall a good game. I recommend you grab the valve complete pack or the orange box instead of this on it's own though.9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An absolute classic FPS with a lasting impact games.  Half-Life introduced storytelling ideas that games still use today, and couples that with very solid shooting mechanics and great level design.  With new graphics and a better system for the (uncommon) box pushing physics, it could easily pass for a great modern game.  You should play through it if for no other reason than to experience history.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's a game that set the standard for its genre.It's a game was far ahead of its time. Unlike other games of its time, it did not force gamers to read paragraphs or watch cutscenes that explain the game’s story. Instead, Half Life throws you right into the life of an average scientist, Gordon Freeman, who finds himself in the middle of an extraordinary adventure. Every moment in the game is experienced through the eyes of Gordon Freeman, and real-time scripted events allow the gamers to react to changes around. For its time, it was groundbreaking.It's a game you can still enjoy today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Am I really sitting here writing about why Half-Life is good? Yes, I am, but that's because it's so amazingly fantastic, so mind-blowingly good, so unquestionably a masterpiece, that it deserves to have what has already been said about it millions of times said again by me. If there was any doubt in my mind that video games are art, it has been eradicated by this game and it's sequel. This may seem like an odd choice for claiming games are art, but I believe it has the depth, complexity, and emotional attachment that a true work of art has. People latch on to games like Braid as examples of games as art because they outwardly appear to be ""artsy"" games, with vague plots and symbolism and plenty of emotional torment thrown at you, but once you look deeper a certain amount of pretentiousness is revealed, and you have to question how meaningful such works really are. Half-Life is not pretentious. It is not trying to appear ""artsy,"" because it knows it has enough value to not have to hide behind such a facade to convince the public of it's worth. It may seem silly to reccomend such a famous game because ""everyone's played it,"" but no matter how famous a game is there will always be someone who hasn't played it (I know I have a whole bucket list of essential titles that remain unplayed, such as Final Fantasy VI and Resident Evil 4), and if that person is you, rectify the situation as soon as possible. It remains a staple of any gamer's collection for a reason. Just be careful dismounting ladders. Fall damage is a ♥♥♥♥♥ in this game.Score: 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life is a game about an evil mastermind named G-Man who creates a clone army at the Black Mesa Research Facility. He is about to launch his invasion of the surface when his arch-rivals, the peaceful alien races of Xen, suddenly attack and begin to wipe out his hapless clone army while destroying the facility. Gordon Freeman, one of G-Man's henchmen, must stop the meddling aliens from ruining G-Man's plans forever! But just when you thought things were silly enough, the US government catches wind of G-Man's intention and sends in a scary (CALL OF DUTY) black ops (IS SICK) squad to kill everyone and seize the facility for their own means!

												One of the best games to have ever been created, Half-Life revolves around Gordon Freeman, a new scientist to the Black Mesa facility, trying to survive against zombies, aliens, military forces, and spec ops. With the aid of fellow scientist, Gordon Freeman goes around the facility seeking to stop the invading aliens who seem to be teleporting onto Earth. Simultaneously, the military has come to silence all Black Mesa workers in hopes of covering up the castastrophic incident. Traveling through the insides of the facility to the mountain sides to the strange alien world, there is always danger around the corner along with a few puzzles to get around. Even with a variety of weapons to get ahead of others, you may find yourself in a tough situation from time to time. The story behind all this is full of amazement as it goes on to the sequal.Multi-player is also an enjoyment with several maps to choose from, custom or otherwise. Players can always find an enjoyment when playing against each other whether it be underground with water traps to a bomb testing facility to Homer Simpson's house.One thing I would like to point out is the over-powered Tao Gun, a lazor weapon capable of killing people through walls with one charged shot and catapulting yourself across the map.

												This is one of the best first person shooters I have played in a while. Even though its graphics and controls are a bit out of date, I found it more engaging than most modern shooters I have played. The story was interesting and got me wanting to know and play more, it wasn't to simple or overly complicated, A fun challenge and highly recomended game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the best FPSs of all time.It is amazing to see, that while of course games today are better considering graphics and sound, and studios have so much more money to throw at development, they in so many cases can't reach the gameplay of those old classics. It seems like the extra money is spend on graphics, big explosions, cutscenes and marketing, Considering Half LIfe: Gameplay - Level Design - Atmosphere - Mods - Importance at the time... outstanding game.10/10 Timeless Classic !

												Half-Life (stylized as HλLF-LIFE) is a science fiction first-person shooter video game developed by Valve, released in 1998 by Sierra Studios for Microsoft Windows. It was Valve's debut product and the first in the Half-Life series. Players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, who must fight his way out of a secret research facility after a teleportation experiment goes disastrously wrong, fighting enemies and solving puzzles.Before this game I had only played Team Fortress 2, Half Life 2, Half Life 2 ; Episode One and Two, Portal and Counter strike.I hadent had much knowledge on this game but I loved Half Life 2 and was intrested on how this one would play out.This game is incredibly fun, it has great gameplay that has held expectations up high for FPS games. It has good graphics for a game from 1998 and has perfect weapons, character models and storytelling10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Half-Life introduced storytelling ideas that games still use today, and couples that with very solid shooting mechanics and great level design.  With new graphics and a better system for the (uncommon) box pushing physics, it could easily pass for a great modern game.  You should play through it if for no other reason than to experience history.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Few games have been as important to the video game industry as Half-Life. The first game to directly integrate storytelling into its gameplay, it revolutionized the FPS genre. The player never leaves the perspective of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who becomes an unlikely hero after finding himself in the middle of a disaster.This game is filled with non-stop action, and it presents no cutscenes, leaving the player in full control of Gordon's actions during the whole game. Its story is one of the best stories ever told in games, and this is where it all started.It also presents plenty of detailed environments, and you really get the feeling of exploring a top secret research facility; and all the different weapons provide a rewarding experience during fight scenes.This game is highly recommendable. Not just that, this game MUST be played by every gamer out there. You surely won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game because it was on sale. I honestly didn't think I'd like it. I've heard a lot about the Half-Life franchise, mostly people pining away for another installment. I thought Half-Life 1 was just a game that was ahead of its time when it was released and got a very dedicated fanbase. Then I started playing it. I always give any game I buy a try, even if only a few minutes. But I quickly found myself enjoying it so thoroughly that time stopped being an issue. It didn't matter that hours were going by playing a game I was ready to brush off. Now I'm eager to finish this installment and continue on the the next.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Try this game, it is fun based heavily off the quake engine the gold source engine holds up making for a fun campain that just like Half-Life 2 holds an amazing envoriment that keeps you locked in the action until you quit. The Squad mechainics are actually preety good in this game and your team members don't get in your way to often and you can tell them to stop and wait which is a bonus.The many diffrent weapons make it fun espically in multiplayer which I can eaisly put many hours into just blowing apart freinds and foes.Try it out maybe pick up Half-Life 2 after you are done, them together are around 20$ or just 10$ for one no reason not to.

												Wish i have friends to play this game, i really liked the story and campaign, i remember i´ve finished the whole thing in the version for Sega Dreamcast, then i played this game on cyber coffees back in 2002/2003 till the year 2005.The most developed shooter in terms of story and the most unique in terms of weapons back in the day, year 1998. A revolution for shooters, just as Resident Evil for Survival horror games and Street Fighter 1 & 2 for fightning games. Of course DOOM was the daddy of all but HALF-LIFE took first person shooters to ANOTHER LEVEL, which inspired games like HALO, Gears of War, etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It seems like the extra money is spend on graphics, big explosions, cutscenes and marketing, Considering Half LIfe: Gameplay - Level Design - Atmosphere - Mods - Importance at the time... outstanding game.10/10 Timeless Classic !

												Half-Life (stylized as HλLF-LIFE) is a science fiction first-person shooter video game developed by Valve, released in 1998 by Sierra Studios for Microsoft Windows. It was Valve's debut product and the first in the Half-Life series. Players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, who must fight his way out of a secret research facility after a teleportation experiment goes disastrously wrong, fighting enemies and solving puzzles.Before this game I had only played Team Fortress 2, Half Life 2, Half Life 2 ; Episode One and Two, Portal and Counter strike.I hadent had much knowledge on this game but I loved Half Life 2 and was intrested on how this one would play out.This game is incredibly fun, it has great gameplay that has held expectations up high for FPS games. It has good graphics for a game from 1998 and has perfect weapons, character models and storytelling10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												     Just finished Half-Life and I must say it was quite an adventure. For being such an old game it is very good! It took a very long time to get through the whole game and the story was quite extensive and very interesting! I played this game simply because I  love the Portal series so very much! Since Portal and Half-Life are linked together I figured I would get more of an explanation as to how the two game link and while portal was never hinted to, for obvious reasons (it didn't come out for another 7 or so years, duh!), I could see how the stories linked on the simple basis of the apocolypse. I'm excited to find out the rest of the story in Half life 2!    The controls are useful and it is very nice that you can save at any point rather than just key points, this is an extremely helpful feature, especially for the ever frustrating jump climb! :P The gameplay is fun and flows pretty smoothly. I have no big problems with the run/jump style. The Story was phenomenol and I really enjoyed it! They put a lot of work and effort into building a great story line.     The Dialogue is pretty good. You never hear Gordon speak, only scientists, guards, etc. which at times is quite comical. The Level Design is also phenominal. They did a lot of work on putting out as many unique levels as possible and they did a great job. The AI is not too much of a problem and I think it was quite advanced for its time. The enemy wont shoot at you if they cant see you which is actually quite nice. They sometimes get into a more strategic formation to face me which is also good work.      The World Design, along with the level design, is phenomenol. The story is linear, but with good cause. It is a story, not an RPG choice adventure. VALVe tells the story via game and I really like it! The Graphics are absolutely lesser than now, but I love it! The nostalgia is great! I really appreciate the old game made available for current PCs because a lot of the modern games can only be supported by super computers and its really nice to be able to play a quality game on a netbook, crappy PC, etc. Finally, the sound goes along with the nostalgia and I love the 8-bit sound effects and voices and music. The music is few and far between, but that just makes it all the more appreciated.      This is definitely one of the video games you need to play. Please support this amazing company, they created Steam and many wonderful games, like Portal and Half Life. Buy this game!The Review outline style was taken from Game Developers Tycoon. Please also consider that game for it is great! :D ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game still holds as one of the best first person shooters, specially because of it's multiplayer. It hasn't aged that well, unlike it's successor. Glitches in the single player campaign can be very annoying, but if you like old games, you must play this. It's a very long game, has little focus on story, so the action is nonstop as you travel trough a lot of different environments, the gameplay never gets boring. And if you already played Black Mesa Source, I still recommend this just because of the multiplayer.The multiplayer is very unique and fun. The different kinds of alien weaponry and the possibility to use some of then to move and jump around makes it very hard to master. I always return to play it because the multiplayer on modern war games always bores me, trying to be realistic and balanced, while in Half-Life you just make a mess with ridiculously overpowered weapons and movement mechanics, it's fast, it's awesome. Half-Life 2 Deathmatch was just not the same in comparison. If Valve decides to make Half-Life 3's multiplayer just like the first game, with more maps, more overpowered alien weapons, faster movement, and a remake of the crossfire map, it will be the best multiplayer game ever, outselling all Call of Duty games combined.

												half-life wasnt the first FPS to do 3D it cam after quake set that 3d benchmark. While Quake gave us gun blazing monster bashing... it was brown and dark... Half-life was light and dark with color to boot. It also made you stop and think with puzzles and plot that left you asking questions that wasnt played out in a scrawl of text on a load screen.It helped define what was possible with FPS's based games and set alight the passion for games for many many people.While it is looking a little dated in the texture deparment the gameplay is solid and the experiance is still a joy to have.

												Few games have been as important to the video game industry as Half-Life. The first game to directly integrate storytelling into its gameplay, it revolutionized the FPS genre. The player never leaves the perspective of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who becomes an unlikely hero after finding himself in the middle of a disaster.This game is filled with non-stop action, and it presents no cutscenes, leaving the player in full control of Gordon's actions during the whole game. Its story is one of the best stories ever told in games, and this is where it all started.It also presents plenty of detailed environments, and you really get the feeling of exploring a top secret research facility; and all the different weapons provide a rewarding experience during fight scenes.This game is highly recommendable. Not just that, this game MUST be played by every gamer out there. You surely won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Half-Life is an action game, with a very interesting story and an amazing atmosphere. Many complain it is another boring game because of bad graphics and release date. Even though it was made in 1998, it will always hold the first place on the top of my gaming list. This game is not to be forgotten.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just great! If you aren't familiar with old graphics then you can buy the game called Black Mesa it's Half-life 1 but with new graphics.The old one reminds you the good old days back in the 90's and the new one got the same awesome story but with new awesome graphics...

												What can I say, it's freakin Half Life, man.  This game came out in '98 and it still holds up today.  Yes, the graphics look like♥♥♥♥♥♥by today's standards, but the gameplay is great, the world is super interesting, and the story is pretty damn good.   If the grapics are too ugly for you to look at, then I reccomend Black mesa or HL Source.  One of the best, and for once, the Metascore is not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like a lot of games, this deserves its 96/100.  I give it a 10/10, one of my favorite.  If you haven't played this, then you need to do yourself a favor and play it.  Come on, it is only $10, that's the equivalent of a small meal at a fast food resturaunt.  Spare yourself 1 small meal to buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Does graphics matter?-NoWell you're looking at the right game! This game blew up gaming industry. This game means alot to me. Back in the day when i had the worst internet. I used to go to my uncles house and set up a LAN party to play with neighbours. Everybody had fun, we all laughed. We didn't even get the game. We used to act annoying and lock ourselfes to the nuke room on Crossfire (what ever it's called) and get everybody mad. We thought the graphics were so damn great. We never got the chance to join servers because our internet wasn't enough to do so.  It was fun. Then we grew up. Everything is amazing now. High tech computers, amazingly fast internet etc... But nowdays i never get a chance to play with my old fellas. I think Valve remastered it. I don't really like the new skins for guns but nothing has changed. The community is same, there are still great servers with players. The storyline on the other hand. At one point this game starts to go point to point which plays a big role in speedrunning. It never gets boring how much you play it. Amazing bugs and tricks still work fine. The game scared me when i was a little kid. I didn't understand one thing because i had no idea how to speak english. Nowdays when i play it, i get excited almost everytime. Gr8 Game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life is still a great game. Its been 16 years and it hasnt gotten old yet. The classic graphics are really good for 1998 technology. Doom was made not long before that, only 7 years or so, and Doom is a 3D game where all the enemys are sprites! This one has almost everything models. Some people over look the graphics quality in this game. They are all like ""That game looks like crap! It has horrible graphics!"" But they never check the date it was made! I give this a 10/10 because of reasons known.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was the first time I played this game and I spent 15 hours to finish it in normal mode without hurry up.Nevertheless I have to say that for the two last bosses (i won't spoil) I had to check on internet to know how to defeat them.This game is a good game but he is difficult on some points, gun fight at the first sight and platform jump. I didn't test it on PS2 or anything else but just by playing with mouse and keyboard.I recommend that game for those who want to, like me, discover this famous game saga but for those who just want fun without worrying, i've only one thing to say: don't play this game.

												Easily one of my favorite games of all time half life has a story that will keep you entralled all the way to the end and changed the way First Person Shooters could be developd as before there games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3d that focused on puzzle solving and mowing down enemys similarly to Half Life. Half Life was made by Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington  and was made using a heavily modified version of The Quake engine known as Gold Src.The reason I enjoy Half life so much is that it didnt need cutscenes because everything would unfold in front of you so you felt like you were experiencing it first hand. In the end if you can get this game i do reccomend it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, this game is SO MUCH BETTER than Half Life 2.For the record, I have zero nostalgia for anything Valve; I hardly played any PC games until around 2014. As someone who had no experience with keyboard+mouse, first person shooters, or games made before 2000, Half Life 1 is possibly the best introduction to all three of those things. Controls are a little wonky (probably cause of its age), but is accessable enough for newbies like myself to master it by the end of the game. There are more than a few spots where you'll get lost, don't know what to do, be forced to do some stupid platforming/firefight, etc. but the parts that are well polished are what make it worthwhile.

Half- life is different in the sense that you need to find your own path and find out what you need to do.

												I absolutely love this game. Almost everything about this game is ahead of it's time. Gameplay, Graphics, and the AI. The guards in the Science lab (Black Mesa) follow you well, and do whatever they can to help you, and their not Half-Bad at it. (Bad pun) The roaches flock to dead bodies, and run away from you, and your flashlight for example. And the military forces distract and then flank you too, which adds some difficulty. This game will occasionally laugh in your face while you try to do something to progress, but it's okay because even though you usually end up dying in the end of the trick, there is usually an autosave just before the trick to give you the chance to correct your mistake. You can also save whenever you want to, and load back to any of the saves you have made.And believe me, you might just need to do that a few times. Sometimes you got a part, and then you can't get past it because you have almost no health by the time you get there. But it's okay, this game is fun and satisfying. You can also make corpses explode with only a crowbar, and that alone is enough to make me get this game. 420/10Also, for some reason, I think I was the only person in the world who actually dug around in the video settings a bit, and you can actually play through the whole game with better looking weapons with clear textures, and they look entirely different. And you can actually read the words BLACK MESA on the guards' badges. I played through the entirety of the game with the HD models, so when I saw playthroughs and screenshots of the game with people using the low quality models I was kind of confused.

												I have yet to finish the game but as of right now, i am finding the game very fun. I mean i liked HL2 more than the orginal in terms of story and in gameplay but HL1 is very fun and at the time it was original. Other games tried to copy the DOOM formula which had a muscular guy who finds joy in shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥and saves th day with a kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack in the backround. But HL made something original. You now have a scientist who is not used to being a ""hero"" who saves has to get out of Black Mesa or else he'll die. The only soundtrack you have is whe something important happens like an explosuion and some music will play or when you get into a heated action scene. And one of my fav parts or the game is you can take your time playing the game. Most shooters at the time just ♥♥♥♥ing bombarded you with enemies and constanly made you fight but his game let you take your time and the most enemies you will meet at a time is like 5-6 where as others will send like 15-20 enemies just all trying to♥♥♥♥♥rape you. But other than that, the story is amazing but they really changes the story in HL2 which on a way annoyed me. But the story so far is amazing, the enemies are not easy but not to hard, the puzzles really make you think about what you need to do. All round the game is amazing. but i still like HL2 a bit more than the original. The only thing i wish they would do is re-release the game when ever source 3  is brought out for full release. Sorry biut HL Source dosen't count that much. All in all Half Life gets a 9.2/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Here's some guns, now shoot each other"".You can buy this because of the amazing mod support.Because Action Half-Life, The Specialists, and Sven Co-Op are all still a blast, and making maps is really fun if you're the kind of person who gets creative in the presence of limitation.You can buy this because it's one of PC gaming's gems.Because it's as amazing now as it was in '99.Any reason is a valid reason to have Half-Life in your library.

												The Beginning of the end. Or the start of a new Beginning? This is the original to the franchise that turned some heads. The original maybe dated as hell graphically but it still has its charm. Also if you do not want to play with the out dated graphics,then get Half Life : Source or download Black Mesa (Half Life remake mod). However Half life is not just about Half life if you get this original. It has tons and I mean tons of mods that people still actively play.

												This game, in my opinion, redefined the FPS genre as a whole in it's day and every day since. I played Half-Life off steam and I could never stop replaying it just because the gameplay is fantastic and the story is nigh unopposed as one of the best story lines to date. If you consider yourself a gamer and haven't played any game in the Half-Life series you need to go sit in a corner and think about what about you've done with your life or pay a measley 10 bucks to experience the amazing experience keeping you from that true gamer status.

												Half-Life is not only the most influential and important FPS ever made, it's also the best. The game excels at both combat and ambiance. Where other games rely on jump-scares or pitch black environments all of the time, Half-Life gives those elements to you in doses small enough that they don’t become stale or overdone. The combat is also excellent, though the controls are a little loose by today’s standards. The game even does platforming and puzzling well. Overall, the game is a must-own for any FPS fan, and even one for those not as FPS-inclined.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												HALF-LIFE. WRITTEN REVIEW NOT COMPLETEquote. Scientist: [playing with tie] Why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties?. Developed by Valve and released in 1998Pros and Conspros. Everythingcons. Nothing 10/10 MasterpiceceSTORYLINEA mysterious Alien Artifact has been recovered and brought to a top-secret research facility in the Black Mesa. When newcomer Dr. Gordon Freeman is assigned to physically test the artifact, things go very wrong when the artifact opens a destructive and unstable portal to Xen, a planet in a different dimension. Gordon blacks out, and awakes in a now crippled and ruined research facility. When Freeman and the survivors of this ordeal discover the portal has allowed its inhabitants-deadly alien creatures-to enter the facility, they realise that they must call the government for help. The government, however, already has plans to contain this incident by silencing the witnesses. Half life's story is a very diverse and confusing one, but is still executed brilliantly. since Half Life does not rely on cut scenes, there are moments when subtle important plot references are hinted towards key features of the story, but these references can be left unnoticed especially on a first play-through. This really depends on the player and their play style if you are to notice these references. Therefore this game mechanic should not be seen as a flaw rather as an attempt to try something new that valve knew very well wouldn’t mix with everyone.GAMEPLAYHalf life is the most influential First Person Game Ever Made. This is best exemplified through its game play mechanics. Let me explain. Growing up as a young grommet the only fps game I was familiar with was DOOM. At the time DOOM was piratically seen as the best pc game of all time. All fps games two follow copied the DOOM formula, all except half life. You see Doom had .NO Apparent storyline.NO Interesting characters .NO Absorbing atmosphere [It felt very arcade like].And no real apparent goalThe game was really a stress reviler where you just shoot s.hit and blow c.unts up. Not saying DOOM is a bad game. DOOM is one of my favourite games its just that Half life beat DOOM at the fps formula in all ways by Half Life having .A fantastic and engaging story..A scary immersive atmosphere..A roster of witty and interesting characters..A simplified moving mechanic.A mechanic where you could look up and down.{ thank F.UCK for that }.A Mixture of action and Puzzles.And a game with an apparent goal from the very start.You see Half Life wasn’t one of those games where you would just shoot s.hit and blows c.unts up. Half Life was the first real fps game to feel like a immersive gaming experience. Therefore we have half life to thank for saving and changing what was commonly thought of as the First Person Shooter Genre.PACINGHalf Life Pacing is Executed very well. The game has the whole survival horror game feel to it and the game really exemplifies this through a sense of dread. At the start of the game it is apparent that you need to escape the black mesa facility but only an hour down the track you start to lose recognition of that thought and just have the mindset of surviving, and that is why this games pacing is so good. You never quite feel like you have an objective to do rather you just feel you have to survive. and coupling this with the fine selection of jump-scares and mind blowing scripted events it truly holds up. LEVEL DESIGN Valve has a name for level design in their games. Its hard to describe on paper but no gaming developer team does it like valve, you just have to see it for yourself, I mean talk about attention to detail. Before Half Life level design in fps video games were very simplistic and felt like an arcade experience. Half Life's level design was truly ahead of its time. Structures would collapse, you could interact with all most everything from the environment, and the game used a clever use of scripted events through the level design. It is very hard to explain on paper but you can tell a lot of work was put into this category of game design for half life.IMMERSIONImmersion, Probably The Fundamental Aspect Of Game Design That Every Game Director Should Take Seriously, Gabe Newell Certainty Did With Half-Life. You See Half-Life Never Breaks The Immersion Because The Game Never Allows The Player To Stop Playing. This Is Because The Game Doesn't Consist Of Cut-Scenes Or Any Other Immersion Breakers. The Game Never Says, ''Hey Maybe You Should Take A Break''. The Only Thing Controlling Your Will To Stop Or Keep Playing Is The Player's Own Demanding Ambition.SOUNDTRACKHalf-Life soundtrack consists of a techno and ambience like tracks. One of Half Life's key elements two its atmosphere is said soundtrack. Half Life's soundtrack always seems to change conveniently creating a completely different mood and atmosphere to the last segment of the game. The use of ambience like tracks for the more creepy, mysterious moments through out the game coupled with the techno prodigy like tracks for the scripted action moments through out the game really create an experience like no other. Not two mention the end credits theme witch really feels rewarding and catchy... here is a link to the end credits theme soundtrack

												Am I really sitting here writing about why Half-Life is good? Yes, I am, but that's because it's so amazingly fantastic, so mind-blowingly good, so unquestionably a masterpiece, that it deserves to have what has already been said about it millions of times said again by me. If there was any doubt in my mind that video games are art, it has been eradicated by this game and it's sequel. This may seem like an odd choice for claiming games are art, but I believe it has the depth, complexity, and emotional attachment that a true work of art has. People latch on to games like Braid as examples of games as art because they outwardly appear to be ""artsy"" games, with vague plots and symbolism and plenty of emotional torment thrown at you, but once you look deeper a certain amount of pretentiousness is revealed, and you have to question how meaningful such works really are. Half-Life is not pretentious. It is not trying to appear ""artsy,"" because it knows it has enough value to not have to hide behind such a facade to convince the public of it's worth. It may seem silly to reccomend such a famous game because ""everyone's played it,"" but no matter how famous a game is there will always be someone who hasn't played it (I know I have a whole bucket list of essential titles that remain unplayed, such as Final Fantasy VI and Resident Evil 4), and if that person is you, rectify the situation as soon as possible. It remains a staple of any gamer's collection for a reason. Just be careful dismounting ladders. Fall damage is a ♥♥♥♥♥ in this game.Score: 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half-Life (stylized as HλLF-LIFE) is a science fiction first-person shooter video game developed by Valve, released in 1998 by Sierra Studios for Microsoft Windows. It was Valve's debut product and the first in the Half-Life series. Players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, who must fight his way out of a secret research facility after a teleportation experiment goes disastrously wrong, fighting enemies and solving puzzles.Before this game I had only played Team Fortress 2, Half Life 2, Half Life 2 ; Episode One and Two, Portal and Counter strike.I hadent had much knowledge on this game but I loved Half Life 2 and was intrested on how this one would play out.This game is incredibly fun, it has great gameplay that has held expectations up high for FPS games. It has good graphics for a game from 1998 and has perfect weapons, character models and storytelling10/10			",5,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game recommendation updated to become a review:UPDATED 27-JULY!This game is amazing, you should either buy it or trade to get it because even if your internet is bad, singleplayer never ends! Because there are a lot of mods that offer you endless amount of fun, also if your internet is good and you only like multiplayer, getting this game is fun too! Because there are endless amount of maps that offer you so much fun! Also there are a lot of mappers in this game! Hell, even I got some mappers added to my Friends List who make great maps! If you want to COOP with friends, Sven Coop is your servant! It is being converted to a ""FREE!"" Standalone version for those who don't own Half-life 1 so don't panic if you dont have half-life 1!Good things: (PROS)-More than thousands of mods that will deliever ongoing experince that will never ever end because of the active community since 1998-A lot of custom maps and custom gamemodes that will play a big role in your HL1 total playtime because of their awesomeness-You can run it in almost any pc rig out there!-The game size is less than 300 MB-Ability to customize the game functions and dive into the code to make an independant half-life 1 mod with a lot of new additions-Thinking about a map that would make the game amazing if it exsisted? Why not make it yourself? Easy mapping software and tools available for Half-life 1.Bad things: (CONS)-In some aspects, there may be some limitations because of the old engine. But not game breaking limitations.-The game seem to be empty over years, so we need more players to play it!-The game is not children-friendly on online. So I dont think kids below age 10 should get this.Feel free to comment, P.S: I'm not a developer and I have nothing to do with Valve!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Action is never reppetitive, and there is also a little bit of puzzles here and there. This is the kind of game that slowly (very slowly, now that I think of it... It took me 23 hours to beat this game) builds up to a climax, which isnt disapointing at all. Although gamplay is fairly simple, Valve managed to create a very diverse game using the limited tools of the time.If you dont care much about graphics, and love a good story, Half-Life is for you.

												Even though it's nearing 20 years old, Half-Life is still a very immersive and cinematic shooter, and years ahead of its time. The level design is great, and it feels spacious without being too open (I never got lost, which is pretty amazing given my track record). There are some great scripted events which lend to the cinematic feel, and while the game doesn't usually have music, when it does kick in it's always super hype. There are also some neat and well-designed bosses which require more that brute force to take down. One of the best single-player FPS experiences.			",135,24,2,15,10,0,15

												* I wrote this in January 2014, on a word document, as that day i did not have internet. I managed to find it on a USB stick today lol""This game is probably one of the best single player games i have EVER played. The story is amazing, as it is quite unique compared to game from that era and maybe in this era as well. I highly suggest that you play this if you have a day or two free. I also suggest you play this one first, before you play Half Life 2. 10/10. I would actually play this again :P			",64,4,1,2,2,1,1

												I have yet to finish the game but as of right now, i am finding the game very fun. I mean i liked HL2 more than the orginal in terms of story and in gameplay but HL1 is very fun and at the time it was original. Other games tried to copy the DOOM formula which had a muscular guy who finds joy in shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥and saves th day with a kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack in the backround. But HL made something original. You now have a scientist who is not used to being a ""hero"" who saves has to get out of Black Mesa or else he'll die. The only soundtrack you have is whe something important happens like an explosuion and some music will play or when you get into a heated action scene. And one of my fav parts or the game is you can take your time playing the game. Most shooters at the time just ♥♥♥♥ing bombarded you with enemies and constanly made you fight but his game let you take your time and the most enemies you will meet at a time is like 5-6 where as others will send like 15-20 enemies just all trying to♥♥♥♥♥rape you. But other than that, the story is amazing but they really changes the story in HL2 which on a way annoyed me. But the story so far is amazing, the enemies are not easy but not to hard, the puzzles really make you think about what you need to do. All round the game is amazing. but i still like HL2 a bit more than the original. The only thing i wish they would do is re-release the game when ever source 3  is brought out for full release. Sorry biut HL Source dosen't count that much. All in all Half Life gets a 9.2/10			",82,13,0,19,13,1,7

												This game made me rethink first-person shooters. It's extremely well done in just about every regard. At this point, the graphics are outdated. But I never minded. My only gripe with Half-Life is that it's too long for what it is. A lot of the situations it puts you through are repeated with only subtle tweeks along the way. This 18 chapter story could've been done in 12-14, and the whole game would've felt more concise as a result. That being said, it's still an amazing classic and a  must-play for gamers. 9/10			",19,3,0,3,0,0,0

												This! This is what started it all. Nearly ten years ago, this game was one of the first games I've ever played on a PC. I was a console-only gamer prior to that. It's Half-Life that got me liking the FPS genre and story-rich games in general. What can I say about it that hasn't been said already. It was a great start to the Half-Life/Portal universe that I got deeply immersed into and can't get enough of.Some say the graphics are outdated- sure they're- it's 2016, but to me, the graphics of a game were never the most important part- the story and the gameplay are! And this game offers fantastic gameplay and solid storyline!If you've played Half-Life 2 and liked it, but for some reason, you still haven't played HL1, you should, cause this is the begining og the entire story.Are those 3 paragraphs of text?

												It's refreshing to still be able to play and enjoy an old jewel like this game, and for those of you young enough not to know the importance of this game, back in its day this classic shooter revolutionized the industry. And now we can enjoy it once again understanding the game's age and that we can't possibly expect it to be on par with modern titles in terms of looks. I played the game through several playthroughs, and at the difficulty I played it, it was quite challenging with quite a few reloads to get it done. This quick save/reload cycle is pretty much an inherent part of how the game plays and it got VERY annoying with several instances me getting close to rage quit it. However the game always won me back no matter what! I encountered little bugs in my experience with it, and I didn't play it in my normal gaming rig but instead in a very crappy laptop. This was due to an idea I have that games from the pre-1080p era should be played in laptops so that they don't look too pixelated and the game played very smoothly with very little bugs.Conclusion: This game is a very nice retro experience, challenging to the point of making you rage quit, but with the power of winning you back after every cry of anger!!!!!!

												Ok now, im going to say it right off. There were alot of thing i did not like about this game. But lets talk a little bit. I played half life 2 and both the episodes before i jumped into this game. Theres alot of references in half life 2, that you wont get unless you played this one. K now first off, the graphics. I dont care about graphics or what year the game was made. For around the 90s this game along with doom 1 WAS THE♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you care about graphics too much, either go get the balck mesa mod or go read the ♥♥♥♥ing wiki. That brings me to my next point, i honestly played this game only to learn the story before half life 2. Your supposed to spend about 12-13 hours on the game. I SPENT 23 HOURS. honeslty i should have just read the wiki. Another thing is the game is VERY ♥♥♥♥ING HARD. like jesus christ wtf. at times it was so confusing i needed to use a guide. A cool thing i liked was there was alot of weapons and you got to learn the story frist hand but it honestly is not worth your time unless you really wanna go for it, if you wanna learn the story, read the wiki. i rate this game 7/10. I did have fun most of the time even tho the AI is♥♥♥♥♥♥and theres a ton of other wrong things, BUT hey this games a classic, and it was pretty fun to play. I would recomend.			",58,2,0,5,2,0,2

I'm pleased to say that Half Life is just as good now as it was back in the late 90's when i first stepped through the door into the Black Mesa Research Facility. The compelling storyline; the immersiveness of the environment; so well crafted that it's still easy to see how this game defined a genre - and it still holds up today.

												A wonderful classic to the Half-Life series. This game was marvellous back in its time and continues to amaze me. I understand the game was made far long ago, but there are still some debatable negatives: - there is no guidance system, and many times I found myself stuck in puzzling situations.- even on easy difficulty, the game can become quite difficult (not necessarily a con).- uneven distribution of health packs. I found myself constantly on low health and finding health stations/packs was quite difficult for me. I found myself switching to easy at certain points just to survive.Overall, a great classic.8.5/10			",116,23,2,14,5,0,10

												+Fun shoot-em-up gameplay+Interesting story if you wish to follow it+There are no cutscenes, you are with Freeman start to finish+Good level design+Counter-Strike+BigMacDavis (Google it)-The occasional bug-Contains a few platforming puzzles (I hate this kind of thing in FPS games, but that's just me)Note: Players accustomed to the modern 'checkpoint system' may find the game difficult, as there are no checkpoints; you must save.

												The game that started it all; Half-Life. You play as Gordon Freeman, a scientist with a PhD in Theoretical Physics, who works in Black Mesa. You're running late for your experiment. Although, after this, you'll wish you were on a sick day.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game is a masterpiece. It has an immersive, original plotline, excellently executed enemies (with their own weaknesses and strengths, mind you), epic weapons, and great graphics that even still hold up today. The game builds an ominous atmosphere right away in the intro. You're on the tram, and you pass by a radioactive ""leak"". That wasn't an accident, Mr. Freeman, but a hint at the Black Mesa servers' condition. When you're off the tram, you head to the locker room (right after blowing up Magnusson's casserole, of course) and get your HEV (Hazardous Environment suit) suit and head over to the experimentation lab, where the entire chaotic mess begins.If you want to know more, play it for yourself.Graphics: 9/10Story: 10/10Soundtrack: 9.5/10Gameplay: 10/10Replayability: 9/10Overall Average: 9.5/10			",68,9,0,15,6,1,3

 Review of Half Life 1 So I always try to continue the meme of ""Where is Half life 3?"", but the it struck me... I haven't even played the original game and I should be ashamed of that!I picked up the game for 3$, fired it up and instantly fell in love with it. When starting I kinda wanted to freerun the game as the mechanics felt so good. Of course they weren't realistic as the new games, but sometimes I just wish more games would be done this way( without the wobbly left right movement). AS I tried to rush the game I soon realized this game requiered some skill. So I had to be a little more strategic. I loved the storyand the monsters in the game. Sometimes I found it too easy to advance into the next chapter as some enemies were stupid like hell, most of the time I strugeled to advance(Ok, I admit. I looked up a yt tutorial).The thing that bothered me the most was the audio quality. Now I'm no programmer, but I think they could have done better even in 1999.Weapon handling was also a blast and found some wepons to be quite unique. To recap all of this in a sentence I would have to say: If you enjoy a game with a fine story, good weapons, bad AI and good graphics (for it's time), this is the game for you.I somewhat enjoyed the game in the same way I enjoyed the oringinal doom. This is the game that set a new industry standard and would be a shame if you didn't have it in your library. Overall this game is a 9/10.			",123,16,1,11,7,0,10

												Half-Life 1 was probably the first game I ever played and strongly got me into PC gaming. Alongside Team Fortress Classic and Counter-Strike, I was so eager to swap from using a family PC to having my own PC just to simply play this game - that's how amazing it was, and still is! For its age, it has a really fantastic feel to it and an engine that has adapted for uses even today (such as Sven Co-op and other MODs).The best thing about Half-Life of course is, as mentioned just now, the MODs that people create for this game. The GoldSrc engine is the only engine I see still being used very frequently nowadays and has such a great potential for newbie developers or even professional developers. Personally I have probably done everything possible with the engine, including map making, media (video/audio creation), modelling and more - it's a really great way to learn how to make your own MOD or possibly even your own game.The actual game itself (Half-Life, its story and the multiplayer) is also incredible. The story is unique (and with the newer Half-Life games in the series, it's still unique!) and the multiplayer is addicting - especially on the MODs (TFC, CS, etc)!I simply can't recommened this game enough - it's genuinely one of the best games out there!

												The game is visually decent, especially when you consider its age.I find the physics engine a little bit annoying at times, but otherwise it is well designed. Unfortunately, there are a few bugs that are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ I even managed to find one that affects the gameplay drastically, preventing the player from progressing. Hopefully, latter games in the series are free from this kind of issues.Despite that and a few other minor nuisances, I consider the technical aspect of the game to be generally good.The plot of Half-Life is the game's strong point. As you play, it gets more tense.I don't particularly like the multiplayer mode, but that's not really a disadvantage, since the game seems to be more focused on the single-player campaign, which is awesome.In short, Half-Life is old, but it's worth playing. I think I'll save up some money for HL2.			",102,11,6,7,10,1,7

												HALF-LIFE. WRITTEN REVIEW NOT COMPLETEquote. Scientist: [playing with tie] Why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties?. Developed by Valve and released in 1998Pros and Conspros. Everythingcons. Nothing 10/10 MasterpiceceSTORYLINEA mysterious Alien Artifact has been recovered and brought to a top-secret research facility in the Black Mesa. When newcomer Dr. Gordon Freeman is assigned to physically test the artifact, things go very wrong when the artifact opens a destructive and unstable portal to Xen, a planet in a different dimension. Gordon blacks out, and awakes in a now crippled and ruined research facility. When Freeman and the survivors of this ordeal discover the portal has allowed its inhabitants-deadly alien creatures-to enter the facility, they realise that they must call the government for help. The government, however, already has plans to contain this incident by silencing the witnesses. Half life's story is a very diverse and confusing one, but is still executed brilliantly. since Half Life does not rely on cut scenes, there are moments when subtle important plot references are hinted towards key features of the story, but these references can be left unnoticed especially on a first play-through. This really depends on the player and their play style if you are to notice these references. Therefore this game mechanic should not be seen as a flaw rather as an attempt to try something new that valve knew very well wouldn’t mix with everyone.GAMEPLAYHalf life is the most influential First Person Game Ever Made. This is best exemplified through its game play mechanics. Let me explain. Growing up as a young grommet the only fps game I was familiar with was DOOM. At the time DOOM was piratically seen as the best pc game of all time. All fps games two follow copied the DOOM formula, all except half life. You see Doom had .NO Apparent storyline.NO Interesting characters .NO Absorbing atmosphere [It felt very arcade like].And no real apparent goalThe game was really a stress reviler where you just shoot s.hit and blow c.unts up. Not saying DOOM is a bad game. DOOM is one of my favourite games its just that Half life beat DOOM at the fps formula in all ways by Half Life having .A fantastic and engaging story..A scary immersive atmosphere..A roster of witty and interesting characters..A simplified moving mechanic.A mechanic where you could look up and down.{ thank F.UCK for that }.A Mixture of action and Puzzles.And a game with an apparent goal from the very start.You see Half Life wasn’t one of those games where you would just shoot s.hit and blows c.unts up. Half Life was the first real fps game to feel like a immersive gaming experience. Therefore we have half life to thank for saving and changing what was commonly thought of as the First Person Shooter Genre.PACINGHalf Life Pacing is Executed very well. The game has the whole survival horror game feel to it and the game really exemplifies this through a sense of dread. At the start of the game it is apparent that you need to escape the black mesa facility but only an hour down the track you start to lose recognition of that thought and just have the mindset of surviving, and that is why this games pacing is so good. You never quite feel like you have an objective to do rather you just feel you have to survive. and coupling this with the fine selection of jump-scares and mind blowing scripted events it truly holds up. LEVEL DESIGN Valve has a name for level design in their games. Its hard to describe on paper but no gaming developer team does it like valve, you just have to see it for yourself, I mean talk about attention to detail. Before Half Life level design in fps video games were very simplistic and felt like an arcade experience. Half Life's level design was truly ahead of its time. Structures would collapse, you could interact with all most everything from the environment, and the game used a clever use of scripted events through the level design. It is very hard to explain on paper but you can tell a lot of work was put into this category of game design for half life.IMMERSIONImmersion, Probably The Fundamental Aspect Of Game Design That Every Game Director Should Take Seriously, Gabe Newell Certainty Did With Half-Life. You See Half-Life Never Breaks The Immersion Because The Game Never Allows The Player To Stop Playing. This Is Because The Game Doesn't Consist Of Cut-Scenes Or Any Other Immersion Breakers. The Game Never Says, ''Hey Maybe You Should Take A Break''. The Only Thing Controlling Your Will To Stop Or Keep Playing Is The Player's Own Demanding Ambition.SOUNDTRACKHalf-Life soundtrack consists of a techno and ambience like tracks. One of Half Life's key elements two its atmosphere is said soundtrack. Half Life's soundtrack always seems to change conveniently creating a completely different mood and atmosphere to the last segment of the game. The use of ambience like tracks for the more creepy, mysterious moments through out the game coupled with the techno prodigy like tracks for the scripted action moments through out the game really create an experience like no other. Not two mention the end credits theme witch really feels rewarding and catchy... here is a link to the end credits theme soundtrack

												1998 Is called the best year in gaming by many. Half-Life is part of the reason why. For it's time, not many games, especially shooters, could boast about bringing about a realistic and highly immersive environment like Half-Life did. It may of aged visually and the sound effects are all but weak by 2011's standards but I wouldn't bet on anything nearing the quality of Half-Life's presentation and broad level architecture. Valve certainly has come along way since then but the basis of Half-Life has played triumphantly to the success of all their subsequent IPs and is all the proof you need that powerful original and inspired design can go a long way.

												9/10 - Great classic FPS that easily stands out, even among more recent shootersPros: Immersive story, plenty of action, wide variety of weapons, mild to moderate puzzlesCons: It is very easy to take fall damage, ladder mechanic is hit-and-miss (you tend to fall alot while trying to use them), boosting platforms often result in death if you don't save and practice with them			",69,14,0,5,1,0,0

												I'm new to the Half-Life series and i've been meaning to get into it for quite some time so I thought I'd better start with the original Half-Life. So I bought this along with Opposing Force & Blue Shift during the sales and I'm so gald I did. This has probably been the best FPS I've ever played. Sure the Graphics haven't aged well but the voice acting along with the story and gameplay are top notch. Opposing Force & Blue Shift were great to but nothing I don't think will ever be as great as this....now time to play Half-Life 2.			",14,4,0,0,1,0,0

												One of the first games I got on the Steam platform, I was surprised at how well a game almost two decades old could hold up.Combining the elements of the firstperson genre of that generation with a compelling narrative, this game was pure genius.The funny thing is, there are ZERO cutscenes.I love it when games do something like this.My official rating of this is 10/10.

												Try this game, it is fun based heavily off the quake engine the gold source engine holds up making for a fun campain that just like Half-Life 2 holds an amazing envoriment that keeps you locked in the action until you quit. The Squad mechainics are actually preety good in this game and your team members don't get in your way to often and you can tell them to stop and wait which is a bonus.The many diffrent weapons make it fun espically in multiplayer which I can eaisly put many hours into just blowing apart freinds and foes.Try it out maybe pick up Half-Life 2 after you are done, them together are around 20$ or just 10$ for one no reason not to.

												Decided to give this game a go and I have no regrets.POSITIVES-Story, really well done and you don't get lost-Gameplay, controls are simple and not a tussle to work with-The variety of weapons keeps the gameplay fresh and gives you new ways or slaughtering enemies-Enemy variety-Hidden supplies, in rooms/boxes-Boss batlle, an actual boss battle and not something half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥br>-The ending is good, so many questions arise and keeps you wanting for moreNEGATIVES-Graphics, aren't the best but the game is from 1998-Some missions you can get confused in about where to go-Sometimes you'll get confused as to what your suppose to do b/c there isn't anything to indicate you so listening to the scientists' dialouge is very importantThats about all I can say, it's fun and interesting and suggest that you also give it a go, try to get it when it's on sale considering it's an old game.

												Half-Life is an amazing game. As a single player FPS game Half-Life exceeds in it's story telling and atmosphere. As a multiplayer game, Half-life is a ridiculous game  that I wouldn't recommend buying. I love to play multiplayer but it's far from perfect. Especially when you have games life Team Fortress 2 that are free.However Half-Life's single player campaign has one fatal flaw. And those are the puzzles. And if you where like me. And you weren't trying to use walkthroughs. It can get pretty annoying. One of the 'puzzles' was hold E for a longer time. One of them *spoilers* **Was hitting a door for a long period of time**Not only that, but you can add mods to your Half-Life games. Improving things like multiplayer. Other game modes. Stories. It's the game that just keeps on giving.			",89,12,1,8,5,0,3

												Half-Life is an all time classic masterpiece. It's a story rich game, full of revolutionizing gameplay material for its time. Its interactive atmosphere, creates a sense of realism to the player. While the graphics were amazing for its time, they are clearly outdated, but either way this game does deserve a play as it is truly amazing (Gameplay wise, and story wise). Gameplay wise, Half-Life's shooting and combat is smooth, and the interactive environment can cause pretty cool easter eggs, as well as intriguing story pieces to uncover throughout the Black Mesa Facility. Story wise, Half-Life focuses on a silent protagonist, which may seem strange for a story rich game. However, Half-Life's character's silence causes the player to react rather than the character, letting the player feel as if they were in the game, and make choices that reflect on themselves not on the character, which really causes the player to feel as if they form a part of the story. I won't spoil the story but I have to say it is unique for its time, and not everyone will be attracted to it, but it's worth a play from my side. :D			",68,5,0,3,4,0,0

This game changed FPS games forever; breaking the cycle of the ""Doom-clones."" If you haven't played Half-Life, do youself a favor and buy it right now. Seriously, Half-Life is pure awesome.

												Although Half-Life suffers from its dated graphics, slippery movement, and annoying design choices (Teleporter puzzle). I still reccomend this game to anyone looking to play something old and different. It has an interesting story for its time, fast-paced action, and barely any glitches or random crashes. When I first heard of Half-Life, I was interested in the series and wanted to know why everyone was putting the Half-Life series in high regards. After playing this game however, I can see why the game has an overall review rating of Overwhelmingly Positive. However, this is the first Half-Life game I have ever played and beaten so, I still have to go through the expansions and Half-Life 2 to fully understand the love of the Half-Life series.Pick this game up and I promise you that you'll love it in the end even after witnessing its noticeable flaws.

												It is unfortunate to say this, but as great a game as Half-Life is, time has not been good to it. When I played the game, it was sad to see how old the game has become. Nonetheless, this is the game to shatter all games for almost a decade.Video games have so much to owe to Half-Life, every single FPS that has come out since then, owes something to Half-life.If you played Half-Life rather thoughtlessly, you may think that the game is seriously overrated, but the story, the dialouge, and the characters in Half-Life are very subtle. Don't expect this game to parade itself as the best PC game of all time. It's modest that way.We can't really say much about the graphics or sound or the character models of Half-Life, as this game IS from 1998, but this game is big where is counts. The gameplay is solid, the story is quiet, - yet brilliant - and the level design is incredible. If you want to know how to make the best game the world has ever seen, go to Half-Life. I wish game designers of today would use this as a model, because you just don't get better.I may be raving about how great the game is, and in that case I have something BAD to say about it...I hate the bloody ladders in this game.

												After finally finishing this game I can say it was one of the best experiences I had with any game on steam. This game (for it's time) has great graphics, amazing gameplay, cool weapons (even cooler than Half Life 2's), hilarious moments with friendly NPCs, great AI that inspired many other games, a variety of  enemies, and a decent story to tie it up together with a few pretty cool ""boss fights"" where in most of them you can't shoot your way out and you need to figure out how to defeat them (although the game gives you pretty easy hints to figure out)  + Great Combat + Great Pacing + Great AI + Variety in enemies, weapons, and environments + Decent Story Notes: * Climbing ladders may be a problem for some (personally I had no problem with it but I can see why people complain). * Aside from an optional tutorial mission, this game doesn't hold your hand at all, and while it may be fun for me and others to explore by ourselves, some people may like an objective, a map, etc. * After finishing the game there are a ton of mods you can try. Final Score: 10/10			",51,11,0,4,3,1,1

There isn't one thing I can think of that single handedly made the game what it is. It just does almost everything right. It's an incredibly hard and challenging game that is worth the $10 it costs, even if you'll only play it once.			",171,21,3,27,15,1,11

												One day in 1998 Lord Gaben released a game called Half-Life, it took off and won over 50 Game of the Year Awards. As for myself, I think Half-Life deserves all of those awards.

												This game was a graphically impressive game back then, and to be honest it's gameplay lives up even now. It's fast paced action which will completely destroy you later on in single player if you jump into everything blindly, and that fast pace makes the multiplayer incredibly fun. It gets pretty chaotic with a lot of players. I suppose my only complaint about the multiplayer is how easy it is to get spawnkilled. Other than that, I can't think of too much wrong with the game for it's time, and I'd recommend buying it if you don't have it yet.EDIT:A small problem I have is when it autosaves. It sometimes does so at the worst imaginable times, like rounding a corner with a bunch of enemies while you have 1 health left. Of course one could always load the previous autosave, but it's still fairly annoying.			",70,11,0,3,3,0,7

												PROS: - Straight-foward story - Enjoyable gameplay - Perfect balance between ammo conservation and limitations - Player-friendly interactionsCONS: - Gordon feels too high over other characters - Story path is never explained to youOVERVIEW:     This game is really ♥♥♥♥ing good. It's pretty high up there, but NOT at the top. (Grab your pitchforks!) Half-Life is the first installment into the series and does not fail to impress. With easy to look at and understand graphics and hands-down some of the finest crafted gameplay in any game i've ever played, this game is something I could replay anytime. Most of you should already know the story and its characters, only because its a Valve game, so i'll spare the story details. While playing through Half-Life, you may notice the crazy balance between ammo and limits. There are a lot of risk-taking moments and sometimes even have you leaving to backtrack for more ammo, which does not feel tedious at all. All interactions in this game are centered around YOU. It feels like you are important to this world, like you really are trying to save it. Overall it just makes for fine story-telling. As for Gordon himself and the way other characters perceive him, it just feels dumb. EVERY other character just feels like they are lower than you, which doesn't show a challenge in the story. I don't know if Valve tried to play a safe-route when it came to the story, but it disapointed me when you felt higher than everyone. It's like having a route, A to B. At B there is a super weapon that you need but instead of walking that route, the game just brings it to you and it does not feel so rewarding.This game is great and highly enjoyable. I'd state my cons at more of a personal pinpoint, but it's really up to you on how you feel about it.			",125,9,1,9,6,1,0

												Half Life is a zombie game in the perspective of one of those responsible for it's origins. In the Black Mesa scientific research and developemt facility (Interesting Banter: Black Mesa roughly translates to Black Table, with Mesa meaning Table in spanish. #TheMoreYouKnow) Gordon Freeman, age 27, inadvertently causes the apocalypse, when a rare crystal found from the facility's experiments with teleportation is places under a super-powered analyzer, which then overloads and opens a wormhole to an alien dimension full of creatures that leech onto your head and gain control over your body, creating zombies.Lost intrest yet? No? Good.Armed with a crowbar, a mech suit, and a series of shooty-shooty bang bang tubes, you face the onslaught, prepared to get to the surface and call for help. Does this go well? Buy the game and see.*This game is old. Like, 1998 old. But when it came out, it revolutionalised the gaming industry with it's unique storytelling and gameplay style. It is a first person shooter that will be remembered for years to come, despite it being 16 next month.However, this game can be PUNISHINGLY dificult, especiallly in later levels. No doubt will you find yourself wishing you'd picked an easier difficulty at some point in the game.Having said this, though, Half Life is still damn enjoyable, even to this day.Verdict: This is a damn fine shooter.8/10. Would happily play again and again a few times.*SPOILERS  The US Army intend to neutralize the threat by killing every living, undead, and alien thing in the facility, It's fun. You get to shoot the same 3 soldier models over and over. :D  ",79,8,1,3,10,0,2

												This is a really good, but frustrating game. Some people might not like the graphics that much, but I didn't have a problem with them at all. It's a good FPS that offers a lot of playtime and difficulty, although Half Life 2 is much better. I'd reccomend getting all of this in the Valve Complete Pack or Half Life Complete, as you will likely like all of the games. One final note: Personally, I feel that this version of Half Life is significantly better than Half Life: Source, as that game is quite buggy and the graphics really aren't that much better.Get it for sure if you like FPS games.

												This is going to be a long review so in short: Half-Life is a classic game, that everyone who likes the FPS genre should play. The price is right, the game is entertaining, and the series of more recent games (Half-Life 2) it leads into are incredible, historicaly, gameplay-wise, and story-wise. Worth your money; you'll enjoy it. In a little more detail: I played Half-Life first, around 2 years ago and I've since logged about a hundred hours in the game. I've played through it 9 or 10 times. I had been needing something new to play after finishing Portal 2 and Half-Life was on sale. I asked a friend if I should play it and he said no - that it was boring, but the price was so good I bought it and tried it anyways, and I was immediately hooked. I've since bought the game for several friends, and it's the first title I bring up to anyone asking for a game reccomendation. Half-Life is an old game. I'm not going to pretend that I would be thrilled with this game if it had come out yesterday. If I bought this game in 2016, let's face it, I'd want a refund. The graphics are extremely dated, the movement is a little tough to get used to, and the AI is seriously lacking. Gabe Newell would be getting an angry email. In 1998, when it was released however, Half-Life was a revolutionary game, with unique and new methods of story telling, exciting new mechanics, and realistic AI. The ability to jump was still a relatively cool new development in the gaming world, and the ability to crouch-jump was very new. Half-Life has a large variety of interesting weapons, and the enemies move and interact with the player in advanced ways for a 90's game. Enemies will follow you, take cover, switch between different types of attacks, call in other enemies, and more. The puzzles in Half-Life are what 90's gamers would have wanted. While jumping puzzles nowadays are lazy and annoying, they were popular in the 90's in the FPS genre, because being able to jump at all was still somwehat of a novelty. The chapter ""On A Rail"" is my LEAST favourite chapter, and annoys the hell out of me, but like the Ravenholm chapter in Half-Life 2, it would have been an exciting way for gamers to test out a fun new game mechanic. The story is told entirely through Gordon's eyes, which creates a level of immersion that had never been seen before in the FPS genre, and that still holds up today. Even despite dated graphics, I still found myself deeply engrossed in the game's world. Half-Life was one of the (if not the) first FPS game to be highly story-oriented. Prior to Half-Life, the FPS genre was not usually chosen for story telling. Valve took the FPS genre to the next level by creating a game that is dynamic in BOTH gameplay, and story. My apologies if that paragraph was a little messy; I have a lot of thoughts. Now I hear you, it's not 1998 anymore, so whether or not Half-Life was a good game THEN is only part of the story. Half-Life can be a revolutionary game-changing (no pun intended) game and still suck to play today, and the reviews section is supposed to give you some idea of whether or not you actually want to spend money on this game and play it. Half-Life is worth a play, 18 years after it's release, in 2016, and it's worth paying your ten dollars to get to do that, in my humble opinion. People dont play games out of context. When I bought and played Half-Life the first time, I bought it to enjoy a classic game. If you expect to play a game with the same graphics quality as Portal 2 then you'll be dissapointed. If you expect to play Half-Life as it is (an 18 year old story-rich FPS) you will be blown away. Half-Life shattered my expectations for what an 18 year old game could be. Don't pretend the game is something it's not. If you're alright with playing an old game, Half-Life will not dissapoint. While some aspects of the game are dated, the core principles (weaponry, characters, story, and gameplay) stand up to time beautifully and the parts that do not (some puzzles, designs of some rooms and levels) do not take away from the over-all experience, and are still fun. Half-Life is fun, stands the test of time where it needs to, bears a great deal of gaming-history, and is the opening installment of one of the most (in my opinion) great game series of all time. For anyone who actually read this far: remember when there were rumours that Half-Life 3 would be released in February 2015? That was funny.			",44,12,0,6,3,0,1

												Half life is Pure art inspired by the great GabeN in the sky. He sent us many steam sales which killed our wallets instantly, and i will be awaiting HL3 so he can decimate our wallets completely with no hopes of recovering. Half life has brilliant level design and simplistic graphics. This is why it is true art. It doesn't require fancy story line or graphics to be fun, It's just fun. similar to megaman and castlevania story isnt important, nor graphics, but the gameplay. Many people today dismiss 8-bit games like them as bad BECAUSE of their graphics, which overall is stupid, obviously. I really wish people played more games like this to show how good games can be without the graphics. (as long as they are pleasing to look at not barphic textures plasted everywhere) Backtracking in this game isnt needed until one part and its actually guided unlike most backtracking, which is excellent level design. Overall Design of the game and levels, fun factory and graphics are great and I look forward to playing more of the Half life series.			",49,3,0,8,5,1,2

												This is the greatest game ever created. If you dont agree you ♥♥♥♥ing suck.Graphics: Back in the 1998 the graphics ♥♥♥♥ing r0x0red everything that was ever released that year. Now they arent so great but from mods such as AHL (action half life for the slow) has some of the best ♥♥♥♥ing weapon models i have ever seen. Also with Blue Shift comes a HD pack which makes all the guns look a hell of a lot better. The grunts look ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful. Sound: ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful gun shots, explosions, speech, all sounds great. The speech is a little fuzzy but its from 1998 so wtf do you want from it.Gameplay: ♥♥♥♥ing great. For a nerd he can move like a jew in a concentration camp. Nothing feels too stiff. It all feels right. Also you can control turrets and ♥♥♥♥ing blow♥♥♥♥♥♥open or shoot abunch of aliens. I can ♥♥♥♥ing shoot down a osprey helicopter have it come crashing down in a massive fiery explosion. Also all the scripted sequences are sexy as me. POOPSHIT BLOWING UP♥♥♥♥♥♥HITTING FANS AND FLYING ALL OVER AND EXPLOSIONS AND DEATH ITS FUSCKING BAUTIFUL!Story: You're a nerd named Gordon Freeman. Although Gordon may look like a nerd he can kick some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out someones mouth and then catch their turd in mid air, throw it in a toilet and flush it with his mind. You are doing this experiment but this ♥♥♥♥ named the g-man decides he wants to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up and then stuff explodes and you are there to kick♥♥♥♥♥Well this is the best game ever created.

												After finally finishing this game I can say it was one of the best experiences I had with any game on steam. This game (for it's time) has great graphics, amazing gameplay, cool weapons (even cooler than Half Life 2's), hilarious moments with friendly NPCs, great AI that inspired many other games, a variety of  enemies, and a decent story to tie it up together with a few pretty cool ""boss fights"" where in most of them you can't shoot your way out and you need to figure out how to defeat them (although the game gives you pretty easy hints to figure out)  + Great Combat + Great Pacing + Great AI + Variety in enemies, weapons, and environments + Decent Story Notes: * Climbing ladders may be a problem for some (personally I had no problem with it but I can see why people complain). * Aside from an optional tutorial mission, this game doesn't hold your hand at all, and while it may be fun for me and others to explore by ourselves, some people may like an objective, a map, etc. * After finishing the game there are a ton of mods you can try. Final Score: 10/10			",51,11,0,4,3,1,1

												This game is so good. It's a masterpiece. The graphics are not very good (they were good for its time), but that doesn't matter. This game is so well executed, so dark, so thrilling, words can't describe it. This was my first game on steam together with the orange box and garry's mod, but this was the only one I could play because my compueter was old and coulnd't support good graphics. This game is also very nostalgic to me because before I had steam, I had a free crack of this game and played it, I was 8 so it was very scary to me. So, this game is a masterpiece, 10/10			",146,38,2,23,8,0,7

												What's the first thing that comes to mind, when reviewing a video game? Well, for me, it has to be the visual world that captures the core of our imaginations. And with this little gem called Half-Life, it's no exception that this game continues to boggle the mind and leave people wondering. There is more heart, creativity and scientific ingenuity there is in this one title than there is in most series and is arguably Valve's greatest achievement. (With over 50 game awards, it's a strong justification). Half-Life isn't just one of the greatest FPS games of all time. It's not because Half-Life is one of the best purchases you can ever get on Steam. Half-Life is quite simply, one of the greatest games ever made.When compared to certain FPS games in the past and modern times, which both heavily rely on long-winded cutscenes to glorify the main plotline, Half-Life annihilates this compulsed aspect, by detailing the plotlines that keeps the player still in control of the first-person viewpoint, leaving the cutscenes rolling while you still have full access to the gameplay and character controllability. For clarification, You will see through the eyes of Gordon Freeman at all times.The game is a constant puzzle; leaving the player to work at tasks that involve being locked into battle and overall puzzle solving to advance through the many challenges that wait up ahead. Most of the time, the story illuminates the puzzles by the actions to proceed, such as maze scenarios and building boxes to use as staircases. Though Half-Life has short-lived loading screens from time to time after leaving a certain area for a new one, the game has no levels. But, to make up for this traditional concept, the game is split into a number of mind-boggling chapters filled with rich story glory.To start off with this game's story, you're none other than Gordon Freeman. A young man who holds a Ph.D in theoretical physics who starts his daily grind back at the Black Mesa Research Facility; a fictional complex that is stranded in a remote desert located in the suburbs of New Mexico. Arriving late for work yet again, you take the tram system around the Black Mesa Research Facility and at this point, objectives that his game has fulfilled such as breath-taking visuals and movie quality animation begins to blossom. The tram sequence at the beginning of the game can only be summed up in one word; Incredible. It's as if the things that come flying at you from every angle and position, almost reminiscent of watching an action-packed movie, along with the credits of the producer's names proudly fading in and out on the corner of the screen.As you make your first step in the heavily secured facility, you're constantly reminded that you put on your Hazardous Enviromental suit, or the H.E.V suit for short. While all things are hunky-dory, those things soon turn to the worst very soon. After a failed experiment, involving a collision between a rare intergalactic specimen from another dimension with an Anti-Mass Spectrometer, the Black Mesa facility falls in ruins, meaning you are one of the only key survivors of the infamous ''Black Mesa Incident''. And with this, alien life-forms from the dimension of ''Xen'' are pulled from their dimension into ours and are running amok the ruined facility, along with the Army that storm the place after the gone, haywired facility's emergency call has been echoed. This of course doesn't make things any easier and you soon find yourself battling both the aliens and army.While there isn't exactly much to complain about, I would admit that guiding the chickened-out scientists and professors around the facility can be quite a pain now and again, as well as the alien life-form, Vortigaunt, from which you would have to wait and be patient for them to wreck down wooden doors in front of you, as you are not capable of doing that yourself. (You do start off with a crowbar, right?) As well as I'm probably not the only one who made the same mistake by killing them through a small opening, before they did in fact begin to tear down the doors. But then again, this is where the used scripted intermissions started to show, so that's an added bonus.For the long run, I've had fun and joy both reviewing this amazing game and playing this amazing game. If you haven't play Half-Life and you're not familiar with Half-Life, it's still a massive recommendation from me.			",53,1,0,1,0,0,0

												I used to play this game when I was more like 8 years old, 2003-4 I believe. So, at that time, I had the 'demo' version, this game well introduced me to gamming realm.  I remember this game, scaring the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. Years passed and after playing a decent number of good fps, I always had this in memory. Thus, I bought this and this is one of my best purchases till date. The gameplay still is ultra-awesome. As a kid, I lacked the story compression skills and man, this story is actually quite good too. Demo version was different, maybe I'll find the scenes in the HL:OF. This game excellent replay value. 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been conned by Valve, you lying hacks. I played the board game ""Life"" a lot as a child, so I bought this game thinking it going to be a digitized, virtual ""prequel"" to my favorite board game, which is why it was called ""Half-Life"" rather than just ""Life."" Boy was I mistaken. In this game, you play as Morgan Freeman, a mentally challenged, mute, scientist with heavy military experience working at Black Mamba research labs, when the mysterious character ""Walter White"" or ""W-Man"" gives the lab a Blue Crystal to ""experiment"" with, you open up an interdimensional portal to try and kill all your coworkers for being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to simply for showing up 30 minutes late. You succeed, and all hell breaks loose. The military also shows up to try and kill me for saying ""Bush did 9/11"" on the internet that one time, and you have to violently massacre them all just for doing their job. Although I did like Morgan Freeman's catchphrases, such as ""Science rules!"" or ""It's cloberin' time!"" Although that was it's only saving grace. All in all, this was terrible, and violent adaptation of a family board game. I never even got to the section where I choose if I want to go to college or not. Don't waste your hard-earned allowence money like I did, go to wal-mart, and purchase the full board game version, ""Life."" Take my word for it, video games and violence do not mix well.

												Very interesting game. If you bought the Valve Complete Pack (which mean you have all the series of Half-Life), then I totally suggest playing it in order, like so: Half-Life: Blue ShiftHalf-LifeHalf-Life: Opposing ForcePortalHalf-Life 2Half-Life 2: Lost CoastHalf-Life 2: Episode OneHalf-Life 2: Episode TwoPortal 2			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A true masterpiece to this very day; Half-Life is worth every cent.The modding support is great (especially with Sven Co-Op), the story is great and the gameplay is outstanding! This game (and it's sequel!) gives every CoD game a 200 kilometer-per-hour kick in the testicles despite being made earlier than said game. And by the way, don't buy the Source version of this game (it's a really glitchy mess of a port with little to no modding support).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Loved every inch of the game. For a game made in 1998, it holds up pretty well. If you're looking for shooter that can run on a low-end comp, this is for you. Nice storyline, tough enemies, and some puzzles  are all what makes this game so special.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The graphics are outdated, but the gameplay still holds. The gameplay is absolutely incredible, the story is interesting, and the controls are tighter then the skinny jeans I tried to wear in 7th grade. Exciting and thrilling despite the graphical limitations. It's almost difficult to believe this was made in 1998, well if the character models didn't look like they had been modeled out of clay and then dropped multiple times. I especially love the health and suit mechanics. It may be old, but it gives you a truly epic feel. Boss fights though scarce are some of my favorites. Thrilling, epic, awesome are all words that could be used to describe this game. I thought I had seen the real experience with the Black Mesa Half-Life 2 Mod, but I was mistaken. There are some differences, and the mod doesn't have the same atmosphere as the original. The original game is easier anyway and I respect that this game is one of the best out there and highly recommend that you play it if you get a chance. It works on even low-rate computers like mine and is way underpriced if you ask me. The music is great, and the level design is some of the best that I have ever seen. Among my few minor complaints are that the friendly NPCs are terrible at following, limited voice actor variety, crouch jumping is annoying, and what you need to do is sometimes nearly impossible to figure out without lots of trial and error. All in all one of my personal favorite games. 11 snarks out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wen i bought this game the only thing i had in mind was how good it was going to get. As it has only positive reviews. I wanted to start with this one and then go to Half life 2 (that i have not played) but then relaized that i did not need to do that. Half life is famouse cause it was one of the first games (i read) that had a original plot or a ""movIe"" type plot. Well the story may be revolutionary then, b-b-but thats not really why i would recomend you to play it. The game started out as kind of boring but got better and better. The last level tho was kind of dissapointing as you had to use everything you learned. Overall its a good game, the graphics... well it has aged well as it was made in 1998. Im looking forward now to Half Life 2.Overall:8,5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It struggled mightily. But the game is still as I remember it. Fun, challenging, humorous. It was great reliving the battle one more time. One last time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
