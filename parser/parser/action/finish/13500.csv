												Of the Sands of Time trilogy, Warrior Within is easily the most controversial of the bunch. Forgoing the whimsical Nights of Arabia theme of the much beloved Sands of Time, Warrior Within employs a much darker tone, replacing melodic instrumentals with blood pumping metal music, and an emperor’s majestic castle with that of some dreadful thing from a metal album cover. Gone, too, is the storybook hero known only as the Prince, who is now a curse spewing, murder loving psychopath, easy to anger and eager to slice open stomachs. Understandably, not all took a liking to the new Prince of Persia, and many either wrote it off or gave up after dying in the first 10 minutes, all while cursing the monsters at Ubisoft who would dare slight their beloved franchise so vehemently. I am ashamed to admit that while I did not join in the publisher bashing those many years prior, I did assume the many fans’ angers as legitimate. After having neglected the franchise for many years since the original, I have finally played through the trilogy’s entirety. Lo and behold, my judgment is thus: Warrior Within is the best of the Prince of Persia trilogy, and one of the most challenging and equally frustrating and rewarding titles I have ever had the pleasure of besting.Where its predecessor, The Sands of Time, relied on linear level progression, a typically gradually increasing difficulty, and relatively basic (and easy) combat, Warrior Within features a (sort of) open world, varied weapons of combat, and enemies that will break your face if you’re not perfect. It also features a higher emphasis on combat than its predecessor, and some of the most frustrating puzzle and enemy design than any other game I’ve played in years. But understand what I mean by that. Warrior Within, for the entire duration, never held my hand. The moment I felt I had a handle on how to deal with an enemy type, a brand new exploding, near unavoidable dog animal thing would be introduced. Obviously, it wasn’t always an exploding dog thing, but you get the point. WW is never easy or gradual in its difficulty. It’s not typically fair, either, but it also never felt impossible, and that’s what made it fantastic. For comparison, while playing Demon’s Souls, I always felt in control of what I was doing, and typically only died if I was quick to run into a room before checking for barriers to hide behind, traps or tricky enemies in the shadows. WW will put you in a room and deal death unto you until you learn to deal with it, and the experience became infinitely rewarding upon besting said situations. Puzzles don’t quite follow the same degree of difficulty that the combat does, but the challenge comes in unintended traversal. By puzzles, I refer to the Prince of Persia’s method of travel; running along walls, sliding down ropes and hanging banners, and avoiding the many, many spikes and saw blades inexplicably sticking out of walls. The open world aspect of Warrior Within allows you to re-visit any portion of the island that you’ve previously visited, and you don’t necessarily have to follow the same paths. However, the design of these pathways are sometimes altered by the game’s events, and even when they aren’t, traversal in any way different from the standard is a challenge in and of itself, as the developers clearly did not design these paths to be easily followed backwards (or forwards, for that matter), as you will have to do. Worse yet, enemy spawns remain, especially those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dogs I mentioned previously, the ones that can take half of your health. If this sounds frustrating to you, it should. But by the point you should even be considering doing anything like this, you will have already become invested in beating down this seemingly personal hell that the developers have created just for you.I won’t divulge any of my secrets for passing through Warrior Within, and quite frankly, I would recommend any and all to refrain from guides as much as possible throughout (except for the collectibles, you’ll need a guide for those). Warrior Within is a truly brutal and often unfair achievement in sadistic game design. It’s also one of my most satisfying completions in the entirety of my gaming career. Nearly every instance of combat in this title will chew on your face and kick you in your♥♥♥♥♥until you really learn to play it. The learning curve can be steep and unfair, and you will want to quit. Don’t. There are no tricks to Warrior Within, and only your skill, and hopefully a share of dumb luck, will see you succeed. What faults it has, of which there are plenty, only add to the experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Regardless of what everyone says, to me this is the most iconic Prince of Persia game and it surely will always have a place in my heart. Overall, it glitches a little from time to time, but it still holds its own in terms of gameplay, even with dated graphics. It is a great game.Ubisoft, if you are out there, revamp this PoP trilogy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The second part of the amazing Prince of Persia trilogy. This time it's a whole lot different kind of adventure. No more fancy palace and no more romance in the air. This game tells you a different story. Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is an excellent game that reveals its greatness as you progress. It starts off a bit run of mill with our moody hero slicing up bad guys, but things take a turn for the best when you get to the island. From here on it's a mind bending challenge after mind bending challenge - each more well thought out and engrossing than the last.The graphics are very dark and atmospheric and the gameplay is great too. The Prince feels nice to control as he runs across walls, swings on poles and does tons of cool acrobatic tricks.They made some huge changes to the fighting system. Now there are lots of combos and even enviormental kills. Now you can grab and throw enemies off ledges and over them.The voice acting seems worse to me.  Especially because Yuri Lowenthal's voice is gone. The music is very different from the first game. This time it's all rock and metal, which I didn't really like. Because I'm not a fan of such. But it was necessary. The game forces you to run away from an dark, terrifying guardian of time named Dahaka. And the music is chosen well for this part of the game. The game looks and feels awesome. The plot is a sick sticky web that makes you think fast and act faster. New powers and weapons are always nice to see in a game. And trust me, there are a lot of weapons here. Especially because the Prince can now Dual Wield. Lots of secret areas, just like the first game. And some awesome hidden weapons too. You'll have to stray off course in order to find them. Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is a challenging and fun game. It requires brawn, brains and an appreciation of wicked looking island. It doesn't beat the first game, but still...10/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Combat and overall gameplay has been significantly improved over The Sands of Time. It makes for challenging and continuously engaging fight sequences broken up by exploring reliably beautiful environments. I can recommend Warrior Within because the combat in it's predecessor was in dire need of refinement and this game meets those needs thoroughly. However, I want to know exactly what was going through Ubisoft's collective heads when they thought changing the light hearted, funny, and romantic tone of The Sands of Time to the angry and serious tone in Warrior Within was a good idea. If you enjoyed the characterization and storytelling from the first game then you'll be sad to hear that neither of which make any sort of return in this game. However, If good combat and thrilling visuals sells it to you, then Warrior Within is certainly worth a look.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best part of Prince of Persia for me. Balance of fairy tale and grim world was perfect here. Maybe Two Trones had speed-kills, but here you can find nice atmosphere and Dahaka, the Guardian of Time, who is downright scary.P.S. Played it before steam was around.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prince Of Persia:As a guy who have grown up with the POP series on the PS2, I can only say that the Prince Of Persia is one of the best games that Ubisoft have ever made. You can just play each game over and over again. Its really a classic.+ The graphics (For the year each game came out) are good! Its really well made.+ The control system and gameplay system are totally amazing! (Highly recommended to play on the PS2, with a PS controller.)+ The story behind each game is very cool and good.+ The soundtracks are really good.This game is highly recommended, Its very fun and it worth every cent.

												This is my favorite Prince of Persia installment. While the creator of Prince, Jordan Mechner, might not like the dark and somewhat brutal approach to the series, me and many other Prince's fans do and there are reasons for it. The developers just did the work well. The level design is nice and entertaining and the setting in the dark castle is beautiful. Another highlight of Warrior Within is the combat system with many awesome looking and effective combos. You'll feel it when you try it.If you're a fan of Prince or some other platforming/fighting games (like Lara Croft, for example), try the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game, the best in SoT series in my opinion! It's still entertaining even though it's old and has poor graphics and doesn't support widescreen resolutions.The only bug I encountered - I couldn't perform a long wall jump. Turns out, the cause was that the game was running at 150-200fps. I enabled V-Sync and the bug disappeared. The game certainly wasn't tested under such conditions back in the day:)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first you might look at how many hours I've played this game. It's kinda misleading, and that's why I wanted to start with the fact, that I've played this game on the PS2 since I was a kid, and I still play till this day because I love it so much. I will just start with the finishing line. I DO recommend this game to ANYONE who is a fan of the Prince of Persia series. IMO this is actually the best one in the whole franchise. It has everything - the prince's acrobatic capabilities (parkour, if you wanna call it like that), loads of fighting/combat combo's, a huge amount of different enemies to face during the whole gameplay, amazing sites and the list could go on forever. Personally I just love this franchise, that's why I'm recommending this game, but this game is just suited for anyone. There are so many puzzles to solve during the game for those seeking some ""brain using"" gameplay, and so many secrets to reveal about the prince himself.Well of course I should also mention about the soundtrack, which is amazing as well (DUH). They really nailed it by using some really nice metal music (especially Godsmack's tracks).20 Empresses out of 10, best game of the decennia.EDIT: After playing it on the PC for a bit, I noticed quite late that the resolution is square, and you have black lines on the sides(YES, that's how much I got into the game, that didn't even notice those lines). There is actually some kind of mod, that you can find in the steam discussions, which helps you put your own resolution, but it's not flawless as well. Nothing relevant will be lost during the gameplay, but you'll get used to it soon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												the first one was great and this one is even much better the story and the powers of the dagger are also present in this game but the combat in the first game which was repetitive was improved in this one it became so good you'll never be bored of it and i liked the parts where the Dahaka chases you and the best thing is that it became more mature than the first one showing the dark side of the prince which i found really cool in the end loved the gameplay loved the characters and loved the story awesome gamethis game is twice what the original was. PoP SoT was explore, slash, explore, slash etc etc. Combat and exploration were almost completey separate. In Warrior Within the two are seamlessly put together to give you a more realistic and combined experience.  This game and its trilogy will always be my all time favorite.. Gj Ubisoft.

												About once a decade I seem to stumble upon a game that changes my life, both spiritually and literally, and those would be GTASA and Skyrim, but this game is one of a lifetime, you should care little for the oppinion of the critics, ( random ex. this is what Terminator 2 is to the first movie). Nietzsche's spirit meets Jack London's Love of Life, the grandour of antiquity entwined with the exotic and the mystic, the will, the spirit and the demonic manifested carnally so eloquently, the brooding and the brutal is so voluptously enhanced by the colors and THOSE CRIMSON curtains and clothing, the combat (although somewhat easy, it's varied) makes you feel like the sweetest wine of the gods washes your lips when you slice through the demons (the executioners' excel at that) mercilessly. Do I have to say anything about Stuart Chatwood's and Inon Zur soundtrack? You, as the Prince, take down golems, carelessly murder the provoking, seducing and manipulative women (here's a model for manly self-control), and then fight the incarnation of fate and win. Now capture how empowering this is, and as  much as it seems slightly unrealistic, and the game certainly has flaws, it is perfect for it's time, and holds an idea, a whole concept never so beautifully presented. (you should only play the game on hard).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Completed this game twice (on both endings) when I was a kid, which was ten years ago.Re-bought now on steam, I see this game has still it's charm!Simple & smooth movement, deep combat with combos & fancy moves, and looooong story playtime, with dark, almost sadistic atmosphere.Even though I don't listen to metal, it really fits this game.Graphics are OK. Animations of fire are somehow too fast, and you need to play with VSYNC on, otherwise you will have some problems due to high FPS value. BUT that's nothing major to worry about.Difficulty - this game can be brutal for newbies. Even frustrating at certain times. But, unlike some other games, this one is highly SKILL based. It's not random - everything can be done without harm. It just depends on your skills, really.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know, this game is kind of the black sheep of the franchise (a franchise that might I add, has been ignored stupidly when it's one of the best Ubisoft has). If you ask fans about it they'll either tell you they love it or they hate it, there doesn't seem to be a middle ground. However I do find it a great game, and as I usually do with my reviews, I'm gonna start with the negative aspects of the game first.First and foremost, the biggest problem this game has are the glitches and bugs. It's no secret that Ubisoft ♥♥♥♥s up their newer releases but their old games are no strangers to that as well. This game still has quite the number of graphic bugs, collision detection, glitched physics and other crap you might think of. And sure, some are useful like the wall-running glitch that can let you extend your wall-running distance effortlessly, but others are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥that will cause a game over on you, such as going through the floor. It's quite shameful that Ubisoft hasn't and will never fix these mistakes, really. I will also add that the game has no Steam support what-so-ever.Second, this is something that you can see a lot on Ubisoft games, from both the new and old. If you pick the Hard difficulty, all that will change is the HP of enemies and how much damage they do to you. Come on, that's not difficulty, that's artificial difficulty. And it sucks. Honestly, ignore the Hard difficulty. I went through the game with it and it just makes the game worse, specially when bosses just have too much health and deal too much, while Easy difficulty is programmed for babies.Third is something that's not a problem with me, but with lots of fans: the setting itself. You see, Sands of Time had a lot of charm on it's style, it was told like a fairy tale and didn't really have much violence; it had a bigger focus on the puzzles and platforming than in combat. Warrior Within flips it over, there's barely any puzzles anymore, platforming has been reworked and it's still there, but combat got a gigantic overhaul and it's the bigger focus. It also went from a faily tale to a violent game in which the main character decapitates, cuts in half and utterly murders most of what's on his way in overly cool ways while the music goes from persian-like music to edgy hard-rock/metal. As I said, it's not really a problem for me, but I know for a fact that a lot of people disliked this game because of it, and you should be aware of it.Lastly, I can't help it but to think the two female characters in the game got stupidly sexualized for no reason what so ever. Specially Shadde of whatever her name is, literally the first time you see her, it's her gigantic♥♥♥♥♥taking most of the screen. What the♥♥♥♥♥♥However, looking away from those problems what we got left is a pretty solid platforming game that had some seriously fun combat mechanics, a decent story and catchy music.The map is pretty cool, and I've always been a fan of it. In the Sands of Time you always went forward and would most likely never visit most of those places again; that ain't happening here, as the Island of Time and it's gigantic damn fortress is well connected and you'll be going from one place to the other. It's sort of like an open world with it's own mini-hub area connecting them all, which I like, andit doubles as good for having both present and past versions of almost all areas, which is really cool when you finally do notice which ones are the same on different times. Though I must question what kind of sense do all of those places make in an in-game prespective, it's impossible to go from one side to the other unless you're some sort of acrobatic monster like the Prince.I've always liked the story of this game, it's not too deep to get lost on it but it does entertain during the 7-10 hours it takes to go through it. It also likes to make you question what's going on early and give you hints of what happened, and incase you didn't catch it, answer them later near the end. And having two different endings is also cool, the other games also needed something like that.The combat is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing Badass. Tons of combos, plenty of weapons, a cluster♥♥♥♥ of ways to deal with an enemy, and it's also quite ♥♥♥♥ing violent and fun to watch. It's certainly a gigantic step-up from The Sands of Time, and I wish Ubisoft didn't just copy it on the sequel (which had almost all the same moves but the gameplay was more stealth focused, which just didn't feel right).The music, while edgy as hell and really different from the previous game, feels quite fitting in here. The atmosphere is really dark and gritty, having hard-rock/metal for half the soundtrack does wonders. Do I recommend this game? Certainly. However be aware of two things: First, the price. Ubisoft usually sucks at pricing and a game this old is kinda expensive at it's current price. On a big sale though, it's a great purchase. Second, that you should totally play The Sands of Time first if you haven't yet. Otherwise you won't understand♥♥♥♥♥♥TL;DR Edition: Great mix between platforming and action-based gameplay with plenty of violence and metal to go along with it. Sure it's edgy as all ♥♥♥♥ but it's also really fun. Story is decent and catchy, the map got a lot of detail, only big negative points being the God-damn bugs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PROS:+ cool & dark story+ 2 endings+ epic Dahaka chase scenes+ great soundtrack+ boss fights+ cutscenes (there be plenty o' booty!)+ no uPlayCONS:- graphical glitches- after a while the monster fighting gets repetitive- really wobbly camera- audio can go out of sync in rare occassions- less fairy tale feel, no FarahComment:The continuation to the classic Sands of Time trilogy I played years ago. And a good successor to the previous game. The story is much darker this time as is shown by both art style and music. This time around it feels less like a fairy tale and more like and action movie. The combat has improved which I found great although the puzzles are weaker this time around. Notable due to lack of Farah co-op levels. The parkour is AGAIN flawed by the weird camera shifting that makes running hard. Mostly during the Dahaka chase scenes. Speaking of these - apart from the camera they are awesome. They include an epic soundtrack and the game really pumps you up to try to get away from the monster. I guess it balances out the fact that there is MUCH more fighting and less jumping around in WW. The boss fights are cool but very punishing so be prepared. There are secrets which you can unlock and if get all of them a water sword appears and you get a different ending! This I thought to be cool because the final fight is then totally different too. Worth mentioning is that the game runs well but there is a glitch now and then. You can see the main design focus is elsewhere but while I find the previous game to be better I still like this one a lot and recommend it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game when I purchased my very first Nvidia gforce video card.I still keep the disc.After finishing the Two Thrones I realized that the ending I got when I beat the Warrior Within was not the desired one (it was bad ending).And playing now I realized that I missed one of the life upgrades and I must play it again.I will gladly do it in spite of glorious Dahaka and annoying glitches.Edit : I just defeated Daha with hockey stick :).This was one of the hardest and most intense moments for me.Dahaka has shown great respect for Prince and it was honor to challange him.Respect for him and his duty.Rest in peace Guardian.

												Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is the sequel to The Sands of Time. The game returns back with the same familiar controls and gameplay but this time the combat has taken a massive overhaul. There are tons of combos and new attack moves and even secondary weapons to pick up. You also revisit many of the same areas over and over with the time changing from past to present so at times it feels like you're just doing the same thing over and over. Overall though it's a worthy sequel that just improves the combat while keeping the core gameplay unchanged so if you enjoyed the first game then you will enjoy the sequel. Only negatives I can say are the game has turned to use rock music during combat (feels out of place) and also has super annoying game over videos everytime you die. So, make sure to delete the game's intro videos and Game Over videos (GO_.bik in Videos folder).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Bronze Egg of the trilogy, easily the most buggy and difficult.It's like they had some sort of quality control crisis, because some things are noticeably crude compared to Sands of Time, like some visuals, sounds, and then theres the glitches. The glitches usually consist of sometimes buggy as hell parkouring, I.E. I go to the very edge of a beam, jump, and end up hover glitching over the end of the other beam, either barely making it, or falling to my death. Then theres some random sound glitches, well at least the glitches in general are sometimes worth a laugh.This sequel has an incredibly emo tone, a ton of new combat moves and combos, a switchable secondary weapon which has durability and can be thrown, a bunch of new enemies, and an evil OCD demon 10 times scarier than Nemesis from Resident Evil 3 that chases you down and wants you dead. Its usually a parkour chase when you encounter him, avoid him and parkour correctly, or die horribly. He's not fond of water, so a chase usually ends past a waterfall or something similar.Also, there are some hidden unbreakable secret secondary weapons in some areas, like a Rayman glove you can slap everything to death with? Or a flamingo that probably came from that weird TV show that was in Max Payne.Then theres the Water Sword, a secret primary weapon you can get near the end of the game by doing some akward backtracking and whatnot (this games equivalent of the Master Sword, except optional), and also you need to have found every life upgrade to get it. It also unlocks the game's true boss/ending as well in which you smack a certain nemesis to death with said sword.So if you liked the first game, and don't mind some hilarious glitches and incredibly annoying dog demons that explode, give this a try.

												A very fun game. The mix of parkour and combat is very well done and it feels so good to slow mo chop an enemies head off.  The story line in my opinion is pretty ok but nothing that will bring tears to your eyes because it is so great. The dark appearance and music does a good job of setting a mood of suspence and danger, as if you are being chased (which you are). There are many secrets that with some effort you can find adding a nice little alternitive than just following the main plot all the way. There are many weapons to find and because The Prince is now wielding two weapons there are some nice combos to be had. The controls are also fluent and well done. However just becasue you are fighting doesnt mean that you just hack and slash your way through, there are many interesting puzzles that add a great element to the game. The game also has decent graphics but you must remember this game is from around 2004 so it is not what you are used to in todays games. Overall this game is VERY FUN and what really does it for me is the great combat, puzzle and parkour mixture. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A worthy sequel to the sands of time, it’s not as good as the first game but it does so many great things on it’s own that it still makes it an excellent game. I wasn’t a big fan of the change of tone from the first game but they do make it work by the premise of the game, the idea of the dahaka and the idea of the island of time etc. A big part of what makes it work is the amazing soundtrack that still holds up so well, I don’t see the game being as good as it is without the soundtrack. I really like the story in the game, I think it is a very cool time travel story but it’s just not as well written and well told as the sands of time is and the characters are nowhere near as good as they are in the first game. The prince himself is almost a completely different person in this game and he is nowhere near as likable or interesting as he was in the original. Still I can’t deny how entertaining the story is and clever at some points too. The combat is really good, the sand powers can be overpowered at times but it doesn’t take away from the fun of the combat. I love the layout and design of the island itself it’s a very cool location to explore and platform across. They could have reduced the amount of backtracking there is though. Overall I think this game still holds up extremely well today.9/10 (Amazing)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Still am eager to end it again!TL;DR (Even shorter here):Best Game Ever Made. PeriodNote for devs: Would kill to get this remastered! :'( Just name him!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game. I like the fact that there are two endings so the first time you play the game and don't get all life upgrades you get the ""bad"" ending, but if you search for the upgrades you will get the ""good"" ending that shows what will happen in the next game ( Two Thrones ). I have played a couple of times this game when it came out but never got the good ending , this time i did :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game way back in 2005 when I was a 12 year old kid and it was the best thing I've played at the time.Decided to pick this up again on Steam in 2016 and I do not regret this at all. Pros:- amazing soundtrack (seriously, I'd sit in the main menu just to hear the track out)- great fighting mechanics- classical platforming returns from Sands of Time with upgrades- a less cheesy story than Sands of Time- a more hardcore experience - it is much less linear than both Sands of Time and The Two Thrones because you can return to certain locations on the island at will to find secrets- you can have a teddy bear as a weapon- dat♥♥♥♥♥br>Cons:- funky wall running mechanics sometimes - you'll end up running along the wall instead of up the wall and die, so basically the camera angles aren't the best at times but they are fine 90% of the time.Overall the best Prince of Persia game out of the 3 original ones. Sands of Time had very boring fighting mechanics, and The Two Thrones kind of strayed from the Warrior Within formula a little.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
