												This stand-alone expansion adds a fun survival mode, an improved RPG skill tree, more varied weapons, and better special effects & physics. Like the first game, it's a lot more fun to play in local co-op (online co-op NOT being supported).There's a level editor included, but it seems like nobody ever released any maps. Likewise, nobody seems to have released any mods, despite the game being open source.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Can definitely recommend! usually goes on sale for 90% off - really good game - 3 characters, well voice acted, upgradeable ""survivor"" and weapons. I played it on the second to the hardest difficulty, will definitely replay on impossible difficulty and try different weapons and upgrades. Guns sound great, one of the best things about the game is how powerful the weapons feel - but the aliens are still a scary threat despite the punch your weapons have. Awesome map design with 20 secrets to find in the highly detailed environments, i found 5/20 first playthrough - secrets unlock interesting new options for gameplay such as ""super physics"" or ""black and white mode"" Final battle seems a bit weak compared to some of the previous challenges already overcome - but still an awesome sequence of gameplay nearing the finale! This is 1 of my best buys of the holiday sale. i havent played the original, but after finishing this it makes me wish i bought the shadowgrounds pack and trusted the title more. 7.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Shadowgrounds: Survivor was first released 7 years ago as a sequel to the original Shadowgrounds. It's a pretty well-made game, all about shooting hordes and hordes of pesky zombies from a top-down perspective. The story isn't remarkable in any way: three survivors of a massive alien attack try to ""get out"" in any way possible.Developer Frozenbyte has however improved upon the original in several ways. First of all, the three characters manage to come across as individuals, not as thirteen-in-a-dozen heroes, mostly thanks to the excellent voice-acting (although it's sometimes over-the-top, but better this than bland voices). Secondly, the weapons-arsenal is pretty neat, with a very distinctive ""feel"" about every weapon and individual weapons for all three character. Added to this is a well thought-out weapons- and character upgrade-system, which adds a light rpg-flavour to the game. Don't expect any keep of delving deep into weapons' customization or character builing, but still, it's pretty well done and really adds some much-needed depth to the gameplay.The original Shadowgrounds already had some solid graphics and these are markedly improved upon in Survivor. Especially light&shadows, explosions, fire effects (awesome flamethrower!!) and physics-effects are really impressive. Just as in the original, level-design is more than decent, with several items to search for and a logical built-up of each level. I found the game to be a tad short: after just under 5 hours I was through the singleplayer-campaign, not even having unlocked all of the character and weapons-upgrades. This can be done in the six unlockable missions where you have to keep alive for as long as possible, but since the leaderbords are dead now, that's fairly useless. Actually I wanted to play along for a bit longer, which is always a good sign. Alas, there have been seven years past since its release, so it seems like this little ""franchise"" will stay at two items forever.All in all, this is totally recommendable game for anyone who fancies shooting dozens of zombies in a no-brains way. I feel it's a bit expensive (7 euro at the moment) for a small-scale seven years' old game, but it gets discounts quite often, especially in a pack together with the original Shadowgrounds. Steam trading cards are a welcome addition too, Steam achievements are not here.Overall score: 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Shadowgrounds Survivor is the unmistakable sequel to previous years top down horde mode shooter Shadowgrounds. Unmistakable because if you didn't see the title you'd be hard pressed to tell them apart.That's not to say Survivor doesn't introduce a few new features, multiple playable characters and a more detailed level progression makes the game a good deal more engaging as you go along. The storyline is as was in the original utterly forgettable and can be easily ignored.The greatest strength of Shadowgrounds Survivor is once again it's use of atmospheric lightning which does a good job at turning otherwise bland encounters with the alien horde into something a little more suspenseful, lending somewhat from the horror genre.The problem is also, once again, that this is a genre that has done it all before, the top down shooter horde mode gives you nothing new, nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before. You go from room to room in a linear progression stopping only to pick up the occasional ammo pack in between scripted attacks by the same massive blob of aliens you've already killed in the last ten rooms. Even the boss battles mostly boils down to the same run and gun tactics as the rest of the game making playing the game feel like a grind the more you progress.All in all as with the original the problem is that Shadowgrounds does nothing to innovate. It adds nothing that you didn't see in the last five games you played int this genre and that makes it a tiresome experience for anyone but the most hardcore fans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Largely disappointing. The first game had a somewhat entertaining plot development, a larger variety of weapons and a fair bit ofpromise. There were more enemies and boss battles. The sequal looks more graphically robust, but at the same time just a poor attempt to grab some more money by releasing a dumbed down game with the same assets.Edit: A lot of people are experiencing 100% crashes with this game. This is due to PhysX. Look up the lagacy PhysX from nVidia and you'll be fine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still playing through my first purchases from my backlog:After a bad first impression, having the game crash on me, I got the needed driver installed in 1 minute flat, and got to work playing. The game then continued to give me sh|t by freezing up my computer when I alt-tabbed to write some notes for my review. I almost quit then and there, but seeing the previous title was pretty good, I stayed on. And I'm happy I did.Sans the minor technical difficulties, the game has some improvements over its predecessor. Grenades are a welcoming feature, implemented with an easy to use meter for measureing distance and timing. You now control 3 different characters with their own chapters in the story, which is a welcome addition. This time you can upgrade your characters as well as weapons, and the varied skills are easy and fun to use. Finished without a hitch on Hard, so players might want to go one step above that.Recommended in spite of the jank. This one should be remastered like the one before it. There is a masterpiece waiting to be born here, but we're not there yet. Fix your sh|t, Frozenbyte, and the remaster of this could be a very decent classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Top-down shooter in which you murder lots and lots of aliens, collect upgrade parts to upgrade your weapons, and unlike in the first game, get EXP, level up, and spend points on several passive abilities, as well as one active ability.The roll has been replaced with a much needed fast dash, the battery on your flashlight never runs out now, and you can now carry up to 5 medkits when you run over them with full health.Also including: Wacky physics, cartoonishly gibbing critical hits, modified weapons, and one newish weapon.It's episodic, you switch between 3 characters throughout the campaign as you progress through it. They all have 3 different playstyles, weapons, and abilities;Play as:The Marine, with the Pistol, Pulse Rifle, Rocket Launcher, and Frag Grenades.As Napalm, the drunk Shotgun, Flamethrower, Minigun, and Poison Grenade wielding dude.Or as Sniper, equipped with a Pistol, Rail Gun, Plasma Rifle, and EMP Grenades.Overall, the game was a bit too easy (well, at least easier than the first) as I NEVER used any of my portable medkits. Also, theres way too many crescendo events (get barriered in, kill a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of aliens until they're all dead or something unlocks, etc) sprinkled throughout the game.Also theres only like one boss, and thats near the beginning of the game, any other ""boss"" after that are bloody crescendo events. The first game had at least several bosses :/Not a bad experience, definitely faster paced (for the most part) than the first game, but I actually kind of liked the first game a bit better.Anyway, if you're a fan of top-down shooters, give this a try when its on sale.

												Like its immediate predecessor, Survivor is a top-down shooter that hearkens back to the days of Smash TV and Total Carnage, except that there is a much more detailed plot and a heavy nod to role-playing games. As opposed to the blanket machine-part upgrade system of Shadowgrounds, Survivor has implemented a more refined approach, with unique class abilities, general class abilities and weapon abilities tailored to each of the three characters. Basic gameplay is still kill or be killed, run and gun, etc. Every kill nets you some experience, which is banked toward increased levels, and each level brings with it some upgrade points. Weapon upgrade parts are still found on the battlefield, dropped by enemies, but now you also get class-specific abilities and character tweaks. These are what increase with each level. Using the marine as an example, you'll be able to buy quick weapon reloads, tough skin and fragmentation grenades. This is in addition to the basic set of character improvements that all three avatars have: radar display, increased health, critical hits, and an ""auto-doctor"" that will dose you with a health kit (if you have one stockpiled) if you fall below 50% health at any time.Survivor really beefed up the graphics. Lighting, already a major element of the ambience of Shadowgrounds, has been used to even greater effect this time. I lost count of how many rounds I wasted shooting at flickering movement that I thought was an enemy but was really just shadows playing off of my flashlight beam. Shaders have also been given some love, textures and particle effects. The overall effect is beautiful.Gameplay: 8/10It is easy to control after re-mapping the keys to your liking. Some weapons have secondary fire and there is lots and lots of action. This is the non-thinking man's action title.Graphics: 9/10Surprisingly, the game looks way better then the original; I know that's not uncommon (duh), but for a value title, the spit and polish rivals that of other full-priced games.Sound: 7/10I liked the voiceovers the characters had, and the ambient music does provide the right feel for the game, but some sound effects are lacking.Difficulty: MediumYou can set the difficulty to your liking.Concept: 7/10A well-used idea, wrapped neatly in a simple game that is surprisingly fun and entertaining.Overall: 8/10You must like killing aliens, lots of action and the kind of game where it pays to go looking down deserted dark corridors.

In Survivor every new area gets a voiced dialogue. It really adds to the atmosphere. All the loading area's become a bit annoying. It's a fun game over all. It's still a grind fest of enemies with weapon parts to upgrade them for more damage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Enjoyable for what it is; an older arcade shooter with some RPG elements. You switch back and forth between three different characters at points throughout the campaign, each with their own unique special abilities and weapon skills. Aside from that, there is nothing truly remarkable about Shadowgrounds Survivor. The graphics are dated but acceptable, and the soundtrack/sound design is actually fairly good. Overall, it's entertaining enough to finish, but it isn't something I'll ever replay. NOTE: In order to play Shadowgrounds Survivor, you'll need to install Nvidia's PhysX LEGACY driver. I wasn't able to launch the game at all without this driver installed. You can find it on Nvidia's website.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A top down shooter with to many problems to list. You have to go out of your way just to get the game running by downloading old compatability drivers just to get the game to start up. Then be prepared to be underwhelmed.The enemies are so dumb sometimes they will simply stand there without response and get gunned down. The graphics at first look alright, then once you continue strolling through the drab environments you really start to notice just how bad the character and enemies models look with a second glance.Local Co-op is almost impossible to get to work, and even when you do it turns into a mess of mixed up controls and an unresponsive menu. So good luck trying to play with a buddy, even if you can get them to sit through the whole ordeal of you trying to set up the freakin' game.Unless you get this in a package or on sale for like a buck or so skip it. You're not missing out on anything, and there are a TON of better top down shooters then this thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Shadowgrounds Survivor (SS) is an above-view shooter which sees an array of characters stranded at various points upon the surface of the moon Ganymede. The not-so-original plot of mass alien invasion is at the core of the game and in turn, provides whichever character you currently control - plenty of enemies to shoot and kill.Along the way, you control the typical grunt, armed with a pistol, pulse rifle and rocket launcher. There's also the female sniper who also has a pistol, railgun and plasma rifle. The last of the controllable characters has a flamethrower, shotgun and minigun at his disposal. None of the stages are particularly hard on standard difficulty and SS itself is not a particularly long game either. I completed it in under 4 hours, with the final 'stage' of the game actually being easier than earlier parts of the game.However, you can play the game in co-op and this makes it much more enjoyable as a result. A worthy purchase, I'd give it 7.5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spending less than what a sandwich costs on the shadowgrounds + shadowgrounds survivor pack was money well spent (bought it on sale for 1,50€). Survivor is a good ""sequel"" to the first, improving on many features. The new physics, the same (or better?) lighting, shadows and shaders for a game not really demanding, the hordes of aliens, with the occasional variety in them, improved weapons, skill upgrades, experience, fun survival mode, some secrets you can pick up to spice up the old campaign from now and again, a cheesy but okay story, fitting the style for people who like movies like Aliens but are fine with not taking everything so seriously.Not many bugs, I did have the physx problem, but a quick look into the community forums resolved that (had to download a legacy driver, then it worked just fine).It's refreshing to see when a developer takes an old idea, the top-down shooter with the sense of style of gunning down hordes of aliens, and mixes it up a bit with working ideas, adding what you can do in a fight; from throwing a grenade with the now-added grenade button, to doing a special attack, to fleeing, flashlight alters at least the spiders behaviour, to simple shooting, also having an alternative attack at your disposal, which varies with the weapon and also needing to be upgraded. The design of the levels and aliens are obviously inspired by many iconic films and characters, but still made in their own unique way which is appealing for a light game of this nature.There are drawbacks, some cinematic animations can be mediocre (animations in general are simple in nature), as with the voice-acting, but I can let that slide, seeing as the atmosphere and gameplay still holds up as giving much more than what I paid for.

I certainly wouldn't hail this as a vast re-imagining of the original title, but I got it in a pay what you want bundle and for roughly 15 cent, I can't complain. It's a relatively short campaign, the shooting is fun and the zombies burst in gory zeal.Had I paid 10-14 dollars for this I probably would be fairly disappointed, so it should go without saying that this is definitely a title to only pick up when there's a good sale going on :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Time to enjoy the buck-forty-nine!Perhaps the game ought to INCLUDE the installation of NVIDIA's PhysX Legacy drivers to avoid future negative reviews.Post Review Comment (about an hour of gameplay): this game rocks... well worth the buck-forty-nine; though, I would've purchased it for more (if I didn't have to go through the task of troubleshooting it right-after installation). Many gamers, like myself, expect to be able to play the game upon installation without hiccups.  Having to dig through helpful (and non-helpful) suggestions at the Community Hub is expected, but not for something critical that would prevent the game from running properly (or at all) right from the start. Still, a very nice game and a great deal at under 2-bucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a bag full of fun for a tiny price.  £1.04 on sale.  OK a wee bit buggy - down in the sewer level everything had a doppelganger - two of me - two of the ai, but hoping this will only last this level.  The graphics are OK nothing wonderful but plenty good enough for this romp through the alien swarming survivor take on things eternal.Story is just enough, no deep philosophy here but enough to keep me page turning.  Each level is a different survivors story with each storyline heading together towards the end.  Also had no problems on my win7 machine running it unlike others.   Yes gets a definite thumbs up, won't keep you coming back for long but for this money it's got fantastic fun value. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a boring game.You are given the powerful pulse rifle early in the game. The first game made you use the pistol and because ammo could become scarce, you were forced to use it. Survivor even gives you a sqad worth of grenades in the first 10 minutes and explosive barrels every 5 seconds. This and the extremely linear and overal bad level design makes the game a waste of time. It does look pretty, even for an older game, but that's all I liked. I expected some technical problems with an older game, but this game gave me a bit too much. First, there are no settings other than gamma. I can't turn on vsync nor change my resolution. It runs at over 120 frames per second, but every 10 seconds it drops 5 and then again back to 120. It's like a slingshot. This and it crashed the first 2 times I tried to run it. Not good.

												On Ganymede, we kill spiders like we do in Soviet Russia...with FLAMETHROWER! HAHAHAHAHA...anyways, on a more serious note, Aliens, parasites, and Space bugs are everywhere, so many dead bodies...no for real though, this game is even better than the 1st. It does have some issues, as it did freeze up on me once and crash, but for the most part it has run well and although shorter than the 1st this game is easily leaps and bounds better. That is not to say the 1st was bad, just too drawn out and it did not have the story to keep going that long. This time, Shadowgrounds is shorter but a ton more fun. The options and ways to dispose of aliens is varied and a blast. Survival mode is even more exciting than the campaign, in my opinion. It is worth a try, however due to the possibility of it crashing on you, I would get it when it is cheap. I got it during the summer sale bundled with the first for only a $1.20. Fun times! ^_^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well lets see.....First I thought ""Hey, look I get both of them for 0,99€....They cant be that great"". So I started playing Survivor and it was pretty boring and strange at the beginning but it started to be a hell lot of fun a bit later. I played it on Easy but it somehow got a bit too hard during the last missions. I would rather call it ""Easy (or Not)"" Anyway I appriciate the graphics, it definitely needs some open-worldish levels. (Some levels can get pretty confusing x3) It is fast, makes alot of fun Isnt too bloody and has some great ideas.-- Shadowgrounds Review --If you are looking for a cheap alien-slaying-adventure THIS is the game for ya :3 Giving it 7.5 out of 10 Pina-Points ^<^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is for the game ''Shadowgrounds Survivor''.Developer:FrozenbyteSeries:ShadowgroundsRelease dates:Windows November 14, 2007,Linux:September 18, 2009,Mac OS X April 13, 2011Genre:Fast-paced top-down shooterPlot:You take control of three survivors who team up in order to defend against an organized alien assault.Pretty straightforward,huh?You have to reach New Atlantis,after having acquired some ''critical'' data and fixed some terminals and pathways in order to do so.In the end you choose a survivor and after you feed in the data to the Defence Mainframe-in order to activate the turrets so that the alien swarm won't get inside the city- you complete the final mission and you finish the game.Pros:1)Fairly cheap(You should consider buying the whole Frozenbyte Collection in order to save some money or wait for sales),2)Pleasant time killer,3)Simple yet fun story,4)Simple gameplay,5)Massive graphics enhancements since it's predecessor(Shadowgrounds).Cons:1)Even though you get to have some more costumization since the original game Shadowgrounds the costumization is still limited and might i say no-brainer,2)Not challenging(You simply have to survive and reach the ending rather than doing quests or completing tasks),3)Limited information(No PDA like ''Shadowgrounds'',no computer screens),4)Really really really small(took me only 4 hours to finish the game and i paced myself)There's no connection whatsoever to the original game(Is it staged before the first Shadowgrounds game is it staged after,nobody knows.Plus in the first Shadowgrounds game the aliens were attacking in order to save the humanity from destroying itself.In Shadowgrounds Survivor the aliens are just mindless creatures,just wanting to kill stuff.I'd really like to know why this happened.Maybe in a sequel?I hope so.Overall a nice experience.I recommend this game but not for the people who want a challenge.Thank you Frozenbyte Developers for this game :).P.S There's the Survival mode where things toughen up and you can set high scores.

												I would define Shadowgrounds Survivor as ""Weekend light fun"".It's almost the same as the original, just a bit deeper: Different characters blasting their whay through alien hordes using different weapons and skills, going from point A to point B grabbing supplies, shooting everything and discovering secrets.As simple as that, the game is short and limited: Three characters, each one with two different weapons and a tipe of grenade, not a big amount of enemies to shoot at, some levels with the smallest variation (There's some defense zones, and in the end you get a mecha) and.. nothing else. The campaign lasts over 3.6 hours (Or that's what Steam says). After beating it, two new difficulty levels are unlocked, several survival maps and extra options (If you found enough secrets) to help you or make things silly in the second playthrough (If you want to do it).Also it has a map editor and coop, although I don't think that it has a very active communitty.In short, is a REALLY short game that does not a lot of things, but it does them right. Its not a great game but it is also not a bad game. If its on sale and you want to spend some time killing aliens, this is a good choice (Even better if it comes with the original), if you are looking for something more than a short distraction, look elsewhere.

												It was almost fun to play. One thing was just so awful and unbearable for me that I almost stop playing and uninstall this game. Aiming. Yup, it's bad. I mean you can get use to third person perspective but some elements of enviroment just get in the way of your aim. It is soooooo anoying.

												Very nice little game: lots of fun for blowing off steam (such as breaks inbetween studying), and genuinely fun, interesting, and challenging. Lots of dark and sometimes confusing areas, but nothing that really bugs. At first it may seem as if the aliens need too much ammo to kill, but once you upgrade that's not really a problem, and you constantly find ammo and are frequently full.There's also a nice story and you play with several characters who have different skills and weapons which makes the change interesting.

												Oy, how could developers go from a decent game into...this. First off, if you play this game immedietly turn off the free camera so that it drops it into an isometric third person shooter. This mimics the first game's camera and it improves the playability of the game immensly. It isn't the worst game, but it pales so much to the first one. It does a decent job at makeing the different 'characters' play differently...but the sniper basically puts the game on easy mode. Not to mention the ending...or rather 'non-ending'.But my biggest gripe comes from changing the flashlight system. In the first game it matteres to manage it since running out of power where it has to recharge in the dark...is bad. However in this game most of the enviroments you don't need a flashlight. This removes the fun and tense moments of entering a dark room, turning on the flashlight, and realising you are in a nest of critters. Pros:-Characters play differently-Graphics are pretty-Decent Isometric shooterCons:-Need to play the first game for the 'story'-Camera is awful until you make it 'classic' style-Characters are flatter then paper-Flashlight mechanic sucks now-Sniper makes the game to easyGet this one on sale, and only in a bundle with the first one. The first one may be an average game, but it was so much better then this outing. Which stinks, since it really could have been so much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The levels are not to linear, and do a good job of combining indoor and outdoor environments.  In addition, controller, widescreen and the Steam Overlay are supported.  Add to that an interesting experience and upgrade system as well as an online co-op mode, Shadowgrounds: Survivor is a good purchase for fans of the action isometric genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first Shadowgrounds kind of typified the linear top-down shooter type in terms of design and was overlong, but had its moments. Survivor attempts to establish more of an identity for itself by offering multiple characters with multiple skill-sets, but this makes the balance and level design suffer. It's just hard to imagine quite what the developers were hoping to accomplish beyond the most surface level aspirations with such a change.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just as good - if not better - than the first, Shadowgrounds: Survivor does away with the fetch quests and goes right to the action. The story runs parallel to the first game, like Half-Life: Blue Shift: different people going through the same situation. You control three different characters this time: a sniper, a soldier and a heavy weapons guy. You don't get to choose which one until the very final missions though. Good thing is that the game supports widescreen now - no more distorted 4:3. Recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just as good - if not better - than the first, Shadowgrounds: Survivor does away with the fetch quests and goes right to the action. The story runs parallel to the first game, like Half-Life: Blue Shift: different people going through the same situation. You control three different characters this time: a sniper, a soldier and a heavy weapons guy. You don't get to choose which one until the very final missions though. Good thing is that the game supports widescreen now - no more distorted 4:3. Recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its odd but the game keeps crrashing on me. It seems fun, but is hard to get into it when the game shuts off so far in. ><Edit: After reading up on this game and it's bugs I found what I needed to make it work. All in all its a good game as top-down shooters go. I also feel its much better then the first game. A tad on the easier side, but worth the time to give it a go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really like Shadowgrounds, but this installment was a little hard to play. But not to the point that it detracted from my enjoyment of it. Every level you control one of three main characters that level-up independently. So it's a little frustrating to jump around and not have that awesome rifle I just picked up for that other character.And I really hate the flamethrower character. I have never, ever found a use for a flamethrower. Fire is not good for killing things. It's only good for scaring them. Let me re-phrase. Fire is not good for killing things efficiently. It is good for killing one or two things so the rest of the things run away in terror. Except in video games the aliens rarely (if ever) run away, so flamethrowers tend to be pretty useless. I'm sure the flamethrower in this game isn't completely worthless. I just don't like it and would rather stick to my trusty sidearm, ""Ginger.""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
