												Just like Team Fortress and Counter-Strike, this was once merely a Half-Life mod that Gabe Newell and his co-workers decided to put some extra effort into. It became a high-end standalone title, and brother, did they make a good job. Improved textures, mechanics and overall level design.The game is pretty simple at its core; it's a elimination/free-for-all game where you have to use your surroundings, levels and weapon - the power disc - to claim yourself the big name of the game. Moving fast and swiftly between platforms in a blitz of your enemies is vital for succession in this game. It takes some time to learn, and even longer to master. But by studying your opponents, you'll pick up their tricks soon enough and give them a taste of their own medicine.One thing that I love about this game is the amount of servers that are available, over a decade after the game's release. You'll never have to wait for a server without open slots, allowing you to easily invite your friends to play with you. Trust me, this game is much more fun with your friends. The more players who join, the better and more intense the game becomes.In conclusion, I think this game is extremely underrated and truly deserves a sequel. Lots of Valve fans seem to have forgotten about this gem, and even Valve themselves don't feature it on their official website. But I'm living proof that this game is still taking breaths. Forgotten but not lost, this game deserves your love. It's a part of the CS1 Anthology and the Valve Complete Pack, so chances are that you already have this game and simply forgot that you have it. Otherwise, it's available for the low price of $4.99 here on Steam (50% off as I'm writing).And yes, the graphics might not live up to today's standards. But when games like Minecraft sells millions of copies, I don't see how graphics are an relevant issue.Oh, a final tip to those who'll try this game out: don't fall.9/10 (Would buy this game for a friend.)

Ricochet, one of the best games on steam. Before I go any further I would just like to say there is a tl;dr at the bottom of this reviewSo I'd like to start by saying that I love this game, and its core gameplay is good enough to look past its few flaws. This game is a mod of the original half-life that came out in 2000, however because of its thriving community and plethora of mods, its age has only really now begun to show. It places you in a future alternate universe where the entirety of existence depends on your ability to partake in the activity of “Duel to the Death Space Frisbee” or DDSF for short. Below I've made a table to outline all the various elements of the game with a rating at the end.     Concept Description Rating out of 10   Story The story of Ricochet is a deep and complex one. You are placed in a totally new world, where it only seems as if people are interested in this sport ""Space Frisbee"". You are never told anything about your character, except that they are a Space Frisbee player. That being said though, your character is made to be disposable, and when your character dies, it's over. You are placed in the shoes of a new person, who wears the same clothing as you, and sounds the same as you, and often shares the same fate as you. It's a highly critical commentary on today’s culture, where it seems as if people are losing their lives to something arbitrary, almost a sport, for no real distinguishable reason. It makes the player contemplate what they are doing with their lives, and whether it is meaningful or not. I won't spoil the rest of the story for you, but all I can say is that you should look forward to epic conspiracies, insane bosses, and one of the most exciting and fulfilling endings in all of video games. 10   Gameplay Now, Ricochet is truly one of this games that you can describe as ""easy to learn, difficult to master"". Its gameplay seems simple at first, as it begins with ""throw disc and hit object"" but as you progress you find more ways to play the game using its initial mechanics. First you're introduced with obstacles that your discs bounce off of, allowing you to start having your discs ricochet. The obstacles then change in complexity and usefulness, as near the later parts of the game, you even start to avoid them as they can be very deadly. There are different power-ups for your discs that change the way you use them, which gives a greater feeling of accomplishment when you figure out how to use one of the power-ups to its fullest affect. Ricochet’s gameplay respects player intelligence by giving you many different ways to play. The depth of the mechanics have been compared to dwarf fortress, and although I wouldn't go that far I can certainly see players sinking thousands of hours into this game trying to really figure everything out for themselves. 10   Graphics There isn't too much to say here. For a game that came out 14 (now nearly 15) years ago, it looks quite good. When in came out it was among the best looking games to date, and remained that way until about 2005. Despite looking a bit aged its color and stylistic focus make it easy and pleasant on the eyes, while still allowing for good atmosphere. 8   Multiplayer I'll just start out by say the multiplayer is AMAZING. It captures the cinematic and atmospheric feel of the single player, while allowing player interaction in a diverse open world. You're allowed to find various ""Arenas"" in which you may do battle with your friends to see who's the best at DDSF. With a booming community, and an incredible amount of modded servers you can easily find yourself playing this multiplayer for hours on end. Even though it's been 14 years, because of its very in-depth gameplay and large community, the Ricochet multiplayer is still one of the best you can find on this platform. 10 All in all, I'd give this game a 10/10. Everything about it is amazing and enjoyable, from its single player, multi-player, stunning visuals, in-depth gameplay, and did I mention its kickin' soundtrack? Well it's amazing. Seriously, if you don't have this game, you need to fix that right now.TL;DR In my opinion one of the best games valve has ever made, I highly recommend this game.			",81,37,1,6,4,0,11

												An absolute pleasure to play through. Ricochet goes where no other Valve game has ever been before - You take control of Pert Kravelski, another overlooked escapee of the Black Mesa Research Facility introduced in Valve's hit title ""Half-Life"" whose goal throughout the entire game is to discover the Saisei code (which I won't spoil for you who don't know what that is).Since Pert's family was kidnapped by the Task Force which invaded the Black Mesa Research Facility in Half-Life, his goal is to break into the barracks of the Task Force and retreive his family, after wasting each and every soldier in the facility, but there is an extremely poetic, creative and unexpected plot-twist which prevents you from doing so (this is the meat of the story)The game runs unbelievably smooth for the time it was made, and the graphics are just stunning. I can't fathom why the Valve fanbase completely dismissed this game, as its feature-set, physics, *and* graphics rival that of Half-Life 2. Buy. This. Game.			",191,12,2,6,7,1,7

Literally nothing we did could stop this Ricochet killing machine. We typed Status into the console and found his Steam page. The man had played 2000+ hours of Ricochet. All he does is wait for people to come onto Ricochet, boot it up himself and decimate them.Like a gatekeeper, an eternal guardian sworn to Ricochet, he waits, He waits for you to challenge him. Which is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.When's Ricochet 2?			",163,24,1,12,8,1,22

												A lesser known game among Steam (and also a definite buy if it's under a buck). Ricochet is one of those games you buy on an extreme sale, play for probably 20 minutes to half hour at a time, then leave it for a while. Doesn't mean it's a bad game.Ricochet's game mechanics revolves around simple movement. The player can move side to side, back and forth but can easily fall off the platform they are on. Players are meant to jump platform to platform, but are only able to by stepping on the arrows at the edge of the platform. The arrows then launch the player into the air and towards another platform. A player in the meantime, can jump at the same time you can and both of you can end up colliding, falling into an abyss of darkness. Or, one player can hit the right mouse button and kill the other guy with a Frisbee The player has the ability to shoot a disk to decapitate the opponent. Some of the maps I have played so far are quite intriguing, but don't offer any significant background to gaze at.It's quite a simple game, and you basically are going to get what you pay for. Servers aren't always full, but I've been fortunate enough at the times that I do jump on (Saturday during the day) that they are. Graphics and sounds aren't anywhere near today's capabilities, but if you are one to enjoy a good game concept and can stand old graphics, this game is for you.Rating for it back in 2000, 7.5/10RATING : 6.9/10 Gameplay B- Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C Replay-ability B- Overall  C+Would be nice to see some additions to the game, more movements variances, more maps, more abilities, maybe melee capabilities?

												Ricochet, I wouldn’t really label it under being a hidden gem or obscure. I mean come on it’s made by Valve, anything by Valve is known to a certain degree. But it is definitely underrated, people always shut down this game because it looks weird and or that it feels empty.Valve certainly doesn’t seem to like it, they pay no attention at all to it and made it worth extra less in the summer sale and didn’t even talk about it in their backlog of old games which has the description of “Eleven games that changed the world, and one that didn’t.”... It’s Valve’s first game that was aimed towards being competitive and also isn’t related to Half-Life.The game’s art-style is obviously derived from Tron, and takes place in some futuristic space planet arena thing. Regardless it’s actually pretty cool. And all the sound effects are unique and satisfying, except I swear the sound when you freeze somebody with a freeze shot is the sound of two lightsabers hitting each other.The game unfortunately has no music of any sorts, I joked about this in a video where it was titled the full soundtrack to Ricochet but it was just an hour of nothing. But this game really could have used some ambience or something.Anyway, the gameplay consists of switching through small floating platforms by launching yourself from a jump pad and throwing projectiles at other players and making them bounce off walls and such to either push them into the endless void below or to instantly kill them with a decapitation shot.You can get powerups that power your discs such as rapid-fire, triple shots, power shots that decapitate, and freeze shots that can home in on other players. That last one may sound overpowered but it’s actually the worst.The game has three maps as followed: Arena, deathmatch, and deathmatch 2. Arena is the more competitive 1v1 map while deathmatch and deathmatch 2 are more for, well, deathmatches with multiple players.And that’s about all the game has to offer in terms of content, but the game is actually pretty addicting and encourages competitive play and for you to pay extra attention to everything detail, especially when you start playing Arena.Ricochet is very, very underrated and has a great and fun experience inside it especially with friends. It’s only $4.99 and is usually $0.99 during sales. I definitely recommend it if you’re looking for a really fun game to play with friends, or just want to experience a piece of Valve’s history.

												Ricochet to me at first was that game VALVe made that they didn't like to talk about. That they wished people didn't remember. I could see why; it was a really small, simple, low def game. in other words to some people, trash. I'm not really sure when I got ricochet, as it was probably included in a counter-strike pack of sorts. I recently held a LAN party with 2 of my friends and we didn't really have any multi-player games to play, so jokingly I said ""Hey guys, let's play Ricochet!"" As luck would have it, they had the game too, so we installed and played it. My first impression of this small, 3-map game was ""This is gonna suck"" but as time went on, we all had a blast laughing at the low-quality screams of falling into a huge pink spinning vortex after being hit in the face by a high-speed disk. If you choose to buy Ricochet, get it in a pack where it's just an included game and don't expect any online servers; rather, play with some good friends and I assure you you'll have a great time.

												Ricochet would be Valve's most obscure game not called Deathmatch Classic if it didn't become a minor meme exactly for being Valve's most obscure game that isn't Deathmatch Classic. It's essentially a first person Tron mod for Half-Life where you run around platforms and throw discs at enemies to try and knock them off into the void.I...guess the gameplay is okay for what it is? I wouldn't exactly know, because despite its meme status very few people actually play this game - and there are no bots. You can arrange pick-up games with a couple likeminded folks on the game's community forum, but that's it.If you do own it, it's probably because you're a Valve nerd who bought the Complete Pack, a dyed-in-the-wool retro gamer who bought the Counter-Strike 1 Anthology which has this game for some reason, or a memelord. I don't know if it's even worth it for anybody else, unless you know other people who not only own but want to play it. This is yet another game that I'd like to give a ""mixed"" rating to, and there's even a mixed icon on the Steam store's search results to display a game with middling user reviews! Come on Valve, show some initiative again.Interestingly, the ""variety of futuristic battle arenas"" touted on the store page boils down to 3 maps that look the same, although given the nature of gameplay they seem to be designed alright. Also, props to the death screams and total lack of music or ambient noise for making the game a little creepy when nobody else is playing it.			",195,39,3,14,32,1,35

A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose.[73] The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere.[74] The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes.[75] True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.[76] Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia,[77][78][79][80][81] biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland,[82] remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[33][34]During the Neoproterozoic, 750 to 580 Mya, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed ""Snowball Earth"", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.[83] Following the Cambrian explosion, 535 Mya, there have been five major mass extinctions.[84] The most recent such event was 66 Mya, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as mammals, which then resembled shrews. Over the past 66 Ma, mammalian life has diversified, and several million years ago an African ape-like animal such as Orrorin tugenensis gained the ability to stand upright.[85] This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which allowed the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues today.[86]Predicted futureMain article: Future of EarthSee also: Global catastrophic riskEarth's long-term future is closely tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 Ga, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 Ga by 40%.[87] The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic CO2 cycle, reducing its concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 500–900 Ma.[88] The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, and animal life will become extinct.[89] After another billion years all surface water will have disappeared[90] and the mean global temperature will reach 70 °C[89] (158 °F). From that point, the Earth is expected to be habitable for another 500 Ma,[88] possibly up to 2.3 Ga if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere.[91] Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.[92]The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 Ga. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150,000,000 km), which is about 250 times its present radius.[87][93] Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).[87] A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually decay due to tidal effects and drag, causing it to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.[93]Physical characteristicsShapeShape of planet Earth. Shown are distances between surface relief and the geocentre. The South American Andes summits are visible as elevated areas. Data from the Earth2014[94] global relief model.Main article: Figure of the EarthThe shape of Earth is approximately oblate spheroidal. Due to rotation, the Earth is flattened along the geographic axis and bulging around the equator.[95] The diameter of the Earth at the equator is 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the pole-to-pole diameter.[96] Thus the point on the surface farthest from Earth's center of mass is the summit of the equatorial Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador.[97][98][99][100] The average diameter of the reference spheroid is 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi). Local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: The maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the Mariana Trench (10,911 metres (35,797 ft) below local sea level), whereas Mount Everest (8,848 metres (29,029 ft) above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%.[n 15]Chemical compositionSee also: Abundance of elements on EarthChemical composition of the crust[102]Compound	Formula	CompositionContinental	Oceanicsilica	SiO2	60.2%	48.6%alumina	Al2O3	15.2%	16.5%lime	CaO	5.5%	12.3%magnesia	MgO	3.1%	6.8%iron(II) oxide	FeO	3.8%	6.2%sodium oxide	Na2O	3.0%	2.6%potassium oxide	K2O	2.8%	0.4%iron(III) oxide	Fe2O3	2.5%	2.3%water	H2O	1.4%	1.1%carbon dioxide	CO2	1.2%	1.4%titanium dioxide	TiO2	0.7%	1.4%phosphorus pentoxide	P2O5	0.2%	0.3%Total	99.6%	99.9%Earth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5,970 Yg).

Due to mass segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.[103]The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%.

The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity. The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 km (kilometers) under the oceans to 30–50 km for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Richochet is among the most played games in the world, and with good reason: it is an amazing game in itself, and even if Valve had never released anything else, this game would still guarantee their position as one of the great game developers.  What makes this game special was Gabe Newell's successful attempt to break the mold of the highly structured and refined rules of video game developement.  At Richochet's most fundamental level, it is the most effective combination of concept, vision and mastery of any medium to date.  It is like a good marriage that completes a feeling inside you, something that lasts forever and grows with time.			",275,28,2,10,19,1,11

In Short - I actually enjoyed Ricochet. Don't listen to all of the hate it gets. Now, I wouldn't recommend spending £4 on the game alone, but if you buy the CS Anthology or Valve Complete Pack, then give it a try. Sure, you'll find very few people. Sure, the gameplay is hard to get used to. But damn, does it feel good to soar through the air, decapitate a man and carry on. Now, so far I've only played one map, and only against bots, but I'm sure I'm going to play some more. Here are some things I liked and disliked -  PROs and CONs -PROs -  Variety of powerups, each spawning randomly every time. Two ways to kill: hitting off the edge, or decapitating. An interesting way of managing how many shots you shoot at once. No fall damage! Use those jump pads as much as you like!CONs -  You cannot shoot up or down. This leaves out any potential of getting an awesome kill after falling. Very few people who actually play. Yeah, this isn't the game's fault, or Volvo's fault. It's the same with most multiplayer games that aren't relatively new, such as HL:DM or DoD. Few official maps to play. NO official Valve servers.  When bodyslamming a player in midair, not much happens, and it tends to be kinda glitchy. Finally -I could probably list more PROs and CONs for Ricochet if there was a need/if I played more, however I don't feel a need at this time. I'd give it a 7.3/10. Don't bother buying it individually, but if you get it in a pack, give it a try. It's a piece of Valve's growing history, even if not one of their best moments. Enjoy this review? Did it help you choose whether to buy the game or not?Join my group, Cipher's Take On for more reviews, and share your own too!~ _BillCipher   ",97,13,0,5,7,0,9

												Perhaps one of the greatest First-Person Shooters of our time, Valve has managed to redeem themselves from the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ known as ""Half-Life"" with Ricochet. Never before has such revolutionary gameplay been unleashed unto our hard drives with such elegance and class. The core mechanics of ""dodge and then shoot your opponents"" and a never before seen in-depth combo system (predating complex games like Batman: Arkham Asylum by years) completely smashed the conventions of the genre when it broke onto the scene in late 2000. The charts don't lie when they say Ricochet outsold ♥♥♥♥♥ whipped ""shooter"" games like Perfect Dark and Aliens Vs Predator at a 3:1 ratio, and for good reason! Who here could honestly forget such classic maps like ""Deathmatch 2"" and ""Arena"" compared to the same old lame♥♥♥♥♥De_dust2's and 2Fort's?Sadly, a jewish plot has emerged from the murky depths of the darknet to tell us otherwise; but I am here to help you wade your way out of the Kool-Aid pool and into the ever beckoning rabbit hole of freedom. John Carmack is a well known member of the Rothchilds industrial complex and JIDF, which has allowed for a complete whitewash over the video games industry. He has slept with atleast five prominent figures in the business, three of which have been confirmed: Sergey Titov (of Big Rigs and The War Z acclaim), John Romero, and later Gabe Newell among others in exchange for the complete deletion and issue of Cease & Desist orders to anything and everything related to Ricochet. This paved the way for the great Video Games Crash and the subsequent release of ""progressive"" and ""sensitive"" games like Quake III: Arena, Unreal Tournament 2004, etc. etc. which have been sonicpowered MEGAPHONES for so-called ""Social Justice Warriors"" to co-opt the hobby and effectively kill Ricochet's community.I implore you to shell out the $4.99 USD for this magnificent pioneer of the FPS Dungeon Crawler genre and ignore ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t JIDF/SJW propaganda like Hatred or Postal 2 which have burrowed their fat, agenda-ridden abdomens into our rights as god fearing American citizens.#GamerGate #NotYourShield			",106,1,2,7,2,0,12

												Ricochet is a game that nearly everyone has played for no more than 3 minutes or never even bothered to install it. As for me. I decided to boot up the game just because of boredom. There was only one server in existance with just one player. Suffice to say, TF2 is free-to-play and has a thriving community. Ricochet does the opposite in a bad way. It's amazing this game is still avaliable to purchase.I usually post a more in-depth review of each game but without anyone to play with, this game will simply not be appealing enough to have fun.

												Ricochet is an official Half Life mod released in 2000. I had heard of it many times, but never played. It was already in the library -came within the Valve Pack- so I wanted to give a try today (19.03.2017) and surprise: It is a multiplayer game. And there is NOONE playing it. Yes, literally nobody was online.I have no idea about gameplay, how fun it is or any other thing since I couldn't play it. Therefore I do not recommend it just based on the reason that there is nobody playing it.So, do NOT buy it seperately.P.S: I am not sure if anyone would care about my review. It is such an old and dead game maybe everyone already is aware of the situation.			",69,2,2,4,5,0,3

												Lifesaving.It all started in the summer of 2000.  The sun was shimmering on the chairs of our concerto stage when I, Sanjay, began to get aroused by our head advisor. Kathline. She was 5'2"" and 220 pounds with a fantastic body for someone like me. This happened during the begining of my journey through puberty and I detected a sudden flow of blood to my pelvic region. To my surprise, my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥was erect. I had read that the only way to rid of the stiffness was to cleanse yourself of the white, creamy, fluid inside. I slowly slipped my weiner out of my pants and began to insert it into the opening of my saxophone. Realizing that my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥did not yet have the gurth to be pleased by the large opening at the end of a saxophone, I walked over to Johnathan and grabbed his oboe. The choir began to reprimand me and tried to take the oboe from me, but I didn't give up. I forcefully thrusted my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥into the butt of the instrument when, all of a sudden, a magical liquid spewed onto Kathline, my true love. They all laughed at me, yelling at me never to come back. I hoped the worst was over when school started in September but the stories of ""Sanjay♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Squirter"" reached my school in no time, and I was tormented endlessly. Day to day people would mock me and hold their instruments near their pelvis. Months later, the date November 1st, I was walking home from school when a car approached me with what looked to be a model of me on top. After playing a recording of what sounded like a prepubescent child having an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my ""model"" squirted out some mayo all over the ground. I was done with my life, ready to give it all up, but then something glorious happened. I spotted a new entry onto the steam store with a game called ""Ricochet"". I decided to give this game a try before I cut my life short. But once I started this glorious creation I couldn't stop. It made me realize that no one could mock me enough to force me to miss out on the greatest game in history. The philosophical value behind this game is much greater than what the creators could have possible imagined.I thank you and hope for everyone to try this game.			",75,2,1,13,8,1,4

Ricochet is an old-school multiplayer only game, an official Half-Life mod to be exact. The objective is to knock enemy players off of the board by throwing various projectiles (in the form of discs) at them, all of which have their own unique compounds and have to be collected around the map. The gameplay is simple, but when there are a fair number of people playing, it is fast paced and a lot of fun.  It was never really a popular game then and it is far from being any more popular now, but it is a lot of fun to play with friends. The servers are empty nine times out of ten so unless you actually have people to play with, it's not worth acquiring Ricochet. Buy it only if you are capable of playing it to it's full potential and you will have fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Across the myriad titles released in this game's generation and beyond, there has never been one quite as unique, quite as diverse, as Ricochet. In both style and execution, this game exceeds what the players, and, I think, the developers, had in store for the experience. It brings you into its world and immerses you in its culture from the very title screen, urging you to play more, to investigate, explore, and really see your environment from the viewpoint of your character. It does this not by throwing you into lengthy, drawn-out cinematics, but with control and movement unparalleled in any game to date, graphics unrivaled by even the largest of studios, and combat so immersive, so unmatched, that no other game can quite compare. No matter what advancements may visit videogames in the future, it's quite certain that Ricochet will always be a masterpiece, a paragon of ground-breaking gameplay and graphics, right up there with Dongers 3: The Revengening and Hello Kitty Island Resort: Uncensored Version.

												As I threw my first disk at another character my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥had grown a whole 5 inches to add to the already 2 inches length of my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game combines Real Time Physics, with fun throwing elements that make the game extrememly amazing. It's too bad my computer exploded after playing this game because of how amazing it was, and NASA is now charging me for destruction of property. I joined a quick scoping Klan after getting a new computer and every time I put in a floppy disk to play this magnificient hunk of amazingness I get a tingly feeling down there that I've only experienced before with uncle phil. The Klan I joined mocked me for my low skill set, but I tried explaining the the complex system of this game that I guess they caught onto really quickly. The leader said ""The game may seem like all you do is click and throw disks at some ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but its much more than that"" and I am terribly greatful that valve decided to put the low pricepoint on this game.

												Ricochet is one of those rare games that is a true masterpiece. Every aspect of the game, from the gameplay, to the animations, to the sound effects are of the highest quality. The gameplay is truly original and a real paradigm shifter. Ricochet's gameplay is cleverly described in the name; you throw out disks (like the kind you'd find in the hit movie Tron) and are able to ""Ricochet"" them off of your suroundings in order to fight your opponents. There are amazingly diverse and creative powerups in your arena that can augment your disks to give them a temporary new mechanic. While the game was likely meant to be played with multiple people, Ricochet has really become an experience that the developers could never have expected as a singleplayer masterpiece. The game is such a fluid and clean experience that draws you in and never lets you go, but at the same time giving you a better understanding of your own life in the world around you. This game supplies fullfilment in a way that no other game can give nor could be expected to give. There is only one question left unanswered by Ricochet. When are we going to be gifted with its sequel, Ricochet 2?			",71,12,0,5,7,0,4

												I like this game. I like it a lot in all honestly. This combines so many good elements of what Valve is capable of, you really don't need anymore games after this. This is seriously the only game on Steam you need. All those other games like, oh, what, Call of Duty: Toasts, Team Hatress 2, Half-Life 2. I mean, come on? Why would Valve make a game only half finished and call it just that? What, you didn't know? That's why it's called Half-Life. HALF-Life. HALF. As in, HALF finished. Read a book people. Going back to Ricochet. This game makes me feel good when I play it. I like to play this game with my friends, Tim and Bob, on the weekends. This game helps me relive all of my TRON: Legacy fantasies. Some say if you play on the right servers (which are rumored to be hidden and only accessable by inputing a hexadecimal IP into the console), you are able to play with Daft Punk themselves. But if you're super lucky. you'll be getting lucky because Pharrell Williams will also be joining you on the server. Talk about Get Lucky, right? Right? RIGHT?! You could imagine my excitment when I heard that Ricochet 2 is being developed and will be released by the end of 2014. I mean, the internet said it would be, and the internet has been proven to never be wrong. I know some people have said that it was fake, but they're just weak. I know I'll be laughing at them when i'll be reliving TRON: Legacy over and over and over again, and they'll be busy collecting virtual hats/bitcoins.			",145,11,8,12,12,1,16

												If you loved games like Mario, Halo, Minecraft, Skyrim, and the GTA franchise, then this IS the game for you. Ricochet is masterpiece that excels in everything that it has to offer like, Great shooting mechanics, an in depth world to explore, awesome unlockable characters, a flawless ai system, over 100 unlockable weapons, an unforgettable, heartbreaking storyline, and graphics that will bring any gaming pc to its knees. Ricochet is a competitive MMO sandbox rpg platformer shooter game.The community is an awesome place to hang out with other fellow Ricochet gamers. All of the post are, funny, and relate to the game.Every morning I can't wait to get on Ricochet to see new quests that I can complete. The game is also great for kids, and adults of all ages, ricochet teaches you about engineering, physics, real world economy, math, and pet sitting.PROS- Awesome story- Great community- Realistic Graphics- Great for the kids- Teaches how to throw frisbees- Cheap price of $73- CONS-insanely addictiveIn conclusion Ricochet is probably the best game since Half life 2, I recommend you buy it today.

Yeah, im about to talk about a game released 16 years ago.I mean, the store ID is 60, its one of the lowest since steam has started working, so yeah it's a very vintage game and I'm going to review it.This game has no plot whatsoever just welcome to the Tron arena of the 2000's.Quick action FPS focused in quick reaction time, you throw discs and you kill other players, just like the description says, it's a battle arena:Originally posted by Valve at the Ricochet's description: ""A futuristic action game that challenges your agility as well as your aim, Ricochet features one-on-one and team matches played in a variety of futuristic battle arenas."" The game is very fun and it runs on the Half-Life engine, the gameplay is very fun and the controls are very good. It's probably the one lightest game that valve has developed and it will be  downloaded and installed in less than 3 minutes.You can grab it for 3.74$ or with a massive discount during sales, during sales it has been seen to go for 0.99$ or 0.74$, it's included in the counter strike anthology pack.I mean you can play this game on a toaster:Originally posted by Valve, about system requirements:MINIMUM: 500 MHz processor, 96mb ram, 16mb video card, Windows XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet ConnectionRECOMMENDED: 800 MHz processor, 128mb ram, 32mb+ video card, Windows XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet ConnectionPros:• You can install it in a matter of seconds• Its easy to understand the gameplay• Gameplay is small but very entertaining• Very good to train accuaracy• Bouncing arround and shooting disks is very fun• You can decapitate your enemies or watche them fall to the void.Cons:• Community is very small• Game has a lack of servers and players• There are only 6 maps wich most of them look the same but with different layouts• Most servers are laggy / abandoned• It's a very repetitive game. Dont take me wrong, I might be going hard on a game that was made in 2000, but as a game reviewer I have to see both good and bad sides, this game isnt bad at all for me and i dont think any of those cons will affect your reactin to the game, its a good game just to grab and play.It's the most entertaining game that you can grab and play 10 minutes every day or while you are bored.I give this game a big 8/10This game is completely good, like I said before the gameplay is very entertaining and fun and the controls are very easy to get used to, of course, its still a game that has around 3-6 maps only, still, its a very fun game that you can grab during a sale and enjoy it a lot.There are around 3 servers that have people, and that's just daily, you can still approach this game during a sale and play it, its fun and very addictive if you get good at it.

												Valves not successful, but very fun and balanced FPS. Inspired by Tron you try to hit your opponents with disks to knock them off the various plattforms. Key to success in this game is mastering the traveling time the disks take and exploiting the movement system of the engine.			",111,8,6,8,8,2,7

												I know many people think it's fun to recommend this game and make some funny comment. The truth is, this the crappiest game ever to be released by Valve, which is not a hard thing to do but still.Ricochet is a game about jumping from platform to platform while throwing frisbees to your opponent and that's all there is to it. A game like this should be free, yet Valve still tries to sell it for like 5 euros.			",1619,636,54,225,180,17,281

												The only reason im not recommending the game is the price. Me and my friend were lucky enough to get it for free. We had lots of fun with it. But i think Valve became nuts to put a price on THIS.The game might be fun, bur it's surely not worth the 3,99. After a while it gets boring, repeatitative (correct me if i spelled it wrong). Also the game is almost dead. If you play it now there is an average of 0 - 2 players on about 8 servers.Seriously don't buy this. ",89,4,0,3,3,0,18

												Ricochet is the best game ever developed! I'd pay a billion dollars just to play Ricochet for 5 minutes! If you do buy this game, be aware that the servers are always too full for you to join, so you may be sitting there for a couple hours (maybe even days) just to get into a game (an extravagant one mind you). I even have a Ricochet jump pad and light frisbee tattooed on my face! I sacrificed getting a job for my whole life just because I love this game! So please do the same and don't buy or ruin your face with some smut like any of the other games they've put out and/or published.			",140,23,1,8,11,0,4

												Hello Fellow Players,I can not recommend Ricochet. It's actually a pretty fun game if you can get some people to play, but that's just it, there are plenty of servers but absolutely no players! I enjoy the mechanics of jumping from platform to platform and throwing discs, but there's nobody else to play with, therefore, no competition. It's another deathmatch type game that would be a lot of fun if people still played, however, they don't. It's only because there are no players that I strongly advise you to refrain from purchasing this game unless you plan on playing it on several occasions with a bunch of friends. Definitely not worth the money, the games time has passed.-Kyle James			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rules are simple. Hours of fun. Not too many people play it anymore, but its well designed and thought out. You jump by walking over the jump plates. Its the closest thing to disc war from TRON without actually being TRON.			",162,10,1,6,5,0,12

												This is usually hailed as the least impressive game to come oout of Valve and...Well, that's not wrong. I only got 35 minutes out of it before getting bored.However, I will say that it is an extremely innovative game design that is actually fun, however long. I say to get this game on sale, as that's where you will get the most enjoyment out of it. (However, if it's not on sale, still get it. All of that Valve money goes to HL3.)			",179,73,14,13,34,2,29

												This is  a seriously underrated game. There should be a lot more people who play this. It's a very simple game where you throw disks to knock people off platforms or use a decapitation shot, you also have launches to shoot you to other platforms. You try to knock people off platforms to earn points. And that's about the whole game. It may be simple, but it's very addictive. It's sad how little people play this, the most I've ever seen was 7 people, and there's like 5 servers. There's 2 gamemodes, deathmatch and arena. Arena is a 1v1 to try and get the first to 3 points. Deathmatch is everyone on the server just goes insane and hits everything that moves.TL:DR, good game, hardly anyone playes. So, get on this game already.			",77,5,0,2,6,1,0

												Ricochet is a multiplayer deathmatch game, which attempts to be original and has virtual/arcade feel to it. It was a free modification for Half-Life, coming along with one of the patches to the game, and from what I know, it was supposed to show new additions to the engine, as well as just being a bonus. Yet now it's being sold on Steam serapately. And in this case, it wasn't a good move.And well... Player base of this multiplayer game is dead. Completely. And is the main reason not to recommend this for purchase.Otherwise, the game is not horrible. It was good for what it was supposed to be - bonus mod. You jump between platforms using boosters and throw discs at opponents, either to push them off into void or to kill them. You regenerate discs ammo all time up to 3 of them. Pushing requires 1 discs, thus can be spammed. Decapating disc wastes all 3 ""ammo"". There is regular respawning power-up. And with usage of HL Engine advanced maneuvering (air strafing) you can try to outsmart enemies by landing on different platform than what is expected.And most often, you will fall into void due to your own clunkyness. Or bump into another player and fall down together.It's just that it tried to push on art direction of ""arcade/virtual"" style too much, thus it lacks any casual fun of ""shoot them the terrorists from awesome guns"", nor does it has any pleasent art in levels themselves.Otherwise, nice bonus mod, for 2-4 players DMing.

												It's so rare in this era of play-it-safe mechanics and shoo-in productions to see a major company taking on a project that leaves the safe zone; Valve's efforts with Ricochet are hugely commendable for the circumvention of gaming conformity they represent. They've created an experience that breathes 50's period class and chews on its grit as well, but, more importantly, that offers players a wholly new and uniquely challenging set of intellectual obstacles to overcome; fantastic and immersive inspection and interrogation sequences, as well as a solid narrative, draw you in. Certainly not every facet of Ricochet fits perfectly with the whole or stands alone without a hitch, but for players who appreciate uniqueness and corporate risk in the modern gaming environment, it is an essential experience.

												Review: Ricochet definately stands out as an old Valve game. With the main menu, loading screens and the HUD, it's obvious that it is Valve once you launch it. I mean you can also see that it's Valve by scrolling down and looking at the developers and publishers (both Valve). This game is a fantastic concept. There are many servers, all with very few to no people playing. The gameplay mechanics are painful to learn and inact. It is definately NOT worth $4.99! For a game that was released in 2000, has many flaws, old graphics, and few people playing? I would definately not call it a rip off, but I would call it a failure. The game can be fun if you play it right, and to see a modernized version of this game would be great, but overall the game is not worth the price it's sold for, and the gameplay can get really repetative. The horrible sounds of your character falling into the void, over and over... Ugh... Anyway, if you DO want to get this game, you should get it in the Counter-Strike Anthology or Valve Complete Pack, or other packs, god knows what else they have... Don't get me wrong, this game is an amazing concept! If they would improve and make it worth our time, effort, and MONEY, it could be a great game. Overall, the game does not look completed, I could imagine so many features to this tron-styled game. I mean it's called 'Ricochet', and that's exactly what it is, glowing platforms in space, that you can jump off and ricochet onto others. Don't waste your time, unless you know exactly what you're getting.Game Cons:   Old gameBroken mechanicsUnfineshed, and buggyTerrible, old HUDNo people playing Game Pros: Fantastic ConceptSometimes funMultiplayer works greatGoes by it's title			",99,11,1,11,5,1,6

Ricochet ReviewCompetitive multiplayer game with aspects of sport and combat.Wow! I was really surprised about this game. It was from VALVE, so I didn't expect it to be bad. It's a really small, basic game. But it is so, so much fun! The only downside is that most people don't play the game anymore, if they did I'd be playing it a lot more! But seriously fun! If you're a VALVE fan then give this game a try for sure!			",338,91,18,24,36,3,29

												Ricochet is a very pleasant surprise - it is one of the funnest games I have ever played. From reviews I would've thought it's just one of those ""10 minutes at a time"" and at first that was true. For the first match I played. However, very soon after that, my friends bought Ricochet as well after seeing me play so we got into a server with about 15 other people and had the fun of our lives. It is highly addictive as nicotine. The graphics are nicely done for the time and never once did I think the game is ugly. There isn't much variety in the gameplay, but it is fun and you will come back to it daily. Good thing is that if you have friends this game is an ABSOLUTE BLAST and you will love it for however long you play it. One time I played the game for 100 minutes straight, until I realised I was playing too much.Get this game... NOW!And the game isn't dead, as the people say. It has a great community with really funny people, and sometimes the servers can have more than 15 players, and that is ♥♥♥♥ing chaos when you don't even know what is happening, but usually there's about 10 people playing overall, so bring your friends over and have fun.

												Where to start...its interesting. Its different. Its valves neglected, ignored, deformed stepchild. Nobody plays it.But randomly, groups of people do. And when this happens, its hilarious. The glitches, the odd mechanics of the game, the sickening death animation with a spining 16-bit bitmap of pink space...its worth it for the laughs. Dont get it until its on sale. Its not worth it at full price. It should be free. Valve makes nothing on it, chances are. ",70,14,1,7,10,0,12

												This is an awful Disks of Tron clone, where the controls are so bad that the vast majority of the deaths by any party are going to be self-inflicted from sliding off one of the very narrow platforms, and where the disks are so slow relative to the players that the only way to hit anyone is either by chance or by being at point-blank range.  The servers are mostly empty at this point, and there is no single-player campaign.  Avoid. ",108,13,0,15,6,0,8

												I have owned this game for over a decade and always considered it a joke. But I recently started playing it; and it may just be the greatest game ever made.I can just imagine the designers saying ""hey, we need to make a game before lunch, let's just make Tron."" And surprisingly enough a movie about being in a video game actually makes a better game than it does a movie - even if it was made in half an hour.So get together with some friends (go out and make some if you have to - worth), grab a copy of ricochet, and go nuts.Also watch out for the one remaining hacker in this game - seriously, who cheats at Ricochet?

												I recommend this game to people who are willing to buy it in groups.  The game has a few purposes to it: don't fall, don't get beheaded, and don't get hit.  There are two game modes (as far as I know): arena (one-on-one matches) and deathmatch.  This game was an idea in which one could make a popular game with a short budget and a simple set of rules.  It did successfully but with short lived fame.  It's fun to play with friends but keep in mind that friends is all you've got because the community is pretty lifeless with some bots.  If you want to play the game, be sure that you have friends who are willing to buy as well.  If you get bored, it's not a surprise even with old-community made content because the idea is still the same.			",45,0,0,1,1,0,2

PROS:+ cool gameplay+ many modsCONS:- not that many active playersComment:This game has a similar issue as other old Valve multiplayer games, the days when this game had many players are gone. Today the community of active players is small and there are not a lot of games to join (I just found a couple of servers with 2 people each). I got this game for free with Counter Strike 1.6 and decided to give it a go. It's a Tron type game with the matching visuals. The gameplay is about disk throwing and pushing your opponents off the platforms. Which is great but lack of people to actually play with pulls down the score a little bit. However even dueling one person is good fun so I recommend it.			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

												Ricochet is probably the apex of gameplay and story-telling in the game industry. The graphics for exceeded anything of its time and the humor is unrivaled. This game is an absolute gem with a great atmosphere and fantastic lighting to go along with it. The multiplayer is composed of fast-paced, balanced and strategic action whereas the single-player is the most immersive experience you could ever experience, spanning over more than fifty hours. The characters are incredibly realistic in terms of their behaviour and their voice lines and serve the plot well. This game is easily worth sixty euros and it costing only fives makes buying it more than worth it.			",104,15,0,6,17,3,15

												Ricochet is a hard game to judge. It is a multi-player only mod that only ever had a handful of players, even back in the day, before Half-Life 2 was released and all the old mods for the original Half-Life started slowly dying off. Nowadays it is a dead game, a pointless purchase and install made even more futile by the fact that it was originally a free mod.I did however, find it to be somewhat entertaining with a group of friends, if only for the chaos of it all. Not the best at what it does mind you but if you own it anyways and have friends that own it you might as well try and organize a game.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												Its Ricochet. No more needs to be said.Tron+Valve=Ricochet.This game is barely a game at all. Two maps, dead community, and only one weapon. An intresting concept let down by poor execution. This is the worst valve game ever made. Never play it. And for whatever deity you belive in sake, don't buy it unless its in a pack. tl;dr Tron sucks.			",225,40,0,28,24,2,30

												I can't think of a better game on Steam. If you can drop the cash for it, it's a wonderful drop-in/drop-out multiplayer game. Simple premise, concise story, easy to understand weaponry, it's all here. The best part of all is that you don't have to worry about a pesky jump function. This is more than definitely worth the cash, and the community is phenomenal as well.			",191,32,5,30,14,2,28

Pros:Jumping around can be fun.That's pretty much it.Cons:Well... the maximum ammount of people playing this game at the same time is about ten.The character is hard to control.Very few servers and very few maps.If you fall off, everything starts spinning very very fast and you probably get eye cancer or something. Don't fall off.So...Don't get this game. Really, it's not a bad idea as a whole. I'd suggest it in 2000. But right now... I think there are much better games you can get with 3.99, or less.

												The servers for this game are dead at this point. Plus, the game itself isn't great.From what I can tell after finally finding a non-empty server, it is just another early-2000s arena game with the added bonus that you can't jump other than on predefined jump pads, and your ""frisbee-esque"" projectiles can't be aimed on anything other than the horizontal axis.This game isn't worth buying.

												I feel as though many, and I mean many people glossed over this masterpiece. It's better than any game out here today! Better than Fallout 4, that's for sure! It's gameplay is nice and the players are very competitive. I think a simple remake of the game with amazing graphics and state of the art mechanicing could easily bring popularity back into it!I hope to see this be the launch title for a possible Source3 engine!!I think Valve did an amazing job on this game. I just wish more people would appreciate this hard work and effort. I'd give it the GOTY award, if only it counted for games of old.10/10			",85,10,0,3,10,3,3

												Ricochet is perhaps the Game i've ever played. The first time I started this game, I was blown right away by the Main Menu art and the background score and I knew it that it would keep me hooked until the end, and it did. This Game is not your regular game as it's quite challenging, perfect for me but some casual players may find it difficult to play because this game severely punishes you for your mistakes. Initially it took me a while to get used to the controls because you cannot re-map them, it's not a big deal but it would be great if we could. The Visuals are breathtaking as you will just stop by and gape at the gorgeous art for minutes. The Audio department did a great job in making the high quality sounds, even minute sounds can be heard clearly. You may get frustrated in certain parts but it's the beautiful sountracks that encourages and keeps you going, and thats an important aspect of a game. They are so beautiful that you just wanna die in peace listening to them. The Dialogues are mystically unique, they don't actually make any sense but they sound so cool. The letdown is that they reused most of the same dialogues in some scenes.Coming to the story, its very emotional and may make you cry easy peasy. Its not complex as The Walking Dead or something but its a Heart touching story. I hate to admit this but tears came to my eyes at the ending, and I'm sure that I'm not the only one.So yeah, every aspect of the game is damn-near perfect. Do yourself a favor and get this Masterpiece, it's worth every penny.TL;DR:Pros:Fluid GameplayHeart touching StoryBreathtaking VisualsCool DialoguesBeautiful level designAnimation varietyAmazing Soundtracks by Gareth CokerCons:Reused DialoguesCannot remap controlsMaybe too difficult for some?Can't return to some areasGlitchy LeaderboardBash Skill control using KeyboardSimply put, it's a Masterpiece10/10			",77,8,1,6,14,2,4

												I'll recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the FPS shooter genre and doesn't mind an old game. This can be a fun game to play but the trouble is the game doesn't actually contain much content which makes it a little repetitive therefore not many people plays it. I recommend playing this game with your friends and I'll guarantee you'll have a lot of fun (maybe).			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

If you like any of the games you have ever played then you will like this. I ran it at over 100 fps and honostly think this is the best game I now do nothing but play this game and my family has abandened me and im living under a bridge using a post offices free wifi my cat died and I missed my 2 daughters weddings. Then one day my ccomputer broke down and i had nothing more to live for. I wright this review as I prepare to jump off the Bridge I was living on and end it all. *Jumps off bridge and dies 5 min later computer comes back on from updating and ready to play Ricochet at over 9000 fps with new graphics card* Liek If yuo cri evry tiem			",110,4,0,8,6,2,4

												Home Improvement: Power Tool Party! , originally developed for the Nintendo 64 in 1999 by Taito, is a four player party game that puts players in control of all of there favorite Home Improvement characters which was made around the same time as the ending of the show and the release of Nintendo and Hudson Soft's Mario Party . As one could guess, Home Improvement: Power Tool Party! is a shameless attempt to cash-in on the popularity of Mario Party and the (pretty much dead at the time) popularity of Home Improvement . However, this game has something that Mario Party wishes it had; Tim Allen.			",225,24,8,30,11,1,26

												This is a very deep and emotional game. First off, it has a wonderful story, up there with such games as Skyrim, Half-Life, and Borderlands. It tells the story of a future America where the only way that people can advance in society is to play a game of life or death. This game they are forced to play in front of thousands of power hungry people is the only way to make it. The protaganist of this game is forced to fight his way through the arena, beating every level, and eventually fighting his way to the boss MechObama. It is a very satisfying game and I recommend it to all.			",142,20,1,16,7,1,31

												Based off of the popular film TRON, Ricochet gives players the freedom of a massive multiplayer deathmatch with an array of strategy with its fine jumps and skills. Valve's greatest game to date for such a low price -- it's hardly something to pass up. This game features the best graphics ever seen on a PC so unfortunately you'll need a powerful computer to run it. It also packs a punch with its fantastic physics engine with realistic jumping, throwing and cloth effects. Comes with an incredible soundtrack for the ages, every song is absolutely phenominal and they are all must-haves for your MP3 player.In summary: this is one of, if not the, best multiplayer games on PC. I highly recommend purchasing this wonderful title. You will not be dissatisfied.			",227,36,3,31,11,3,34

Its fast-paced gameplay and state of the art high resolution graphics will keep you on the edge of your seat and keep you entertained for hours. What are you waiting for?

												A cult hit and one that Valve considers ahead of its time. Ricochet is an enjoyable arena-style FPS with careful jumping and precise disc throwing being the focus of the game. A friendly community will show you the ropes, and the servers are usually populated, so find a game and give Ricochet a shot.			",209,38,4,15,11,3,16

												If you can find a server, this game is surprisingly entertaining in short bursts. No music, just the sound of you shooting off platforms, and your enemy decapitating you with their disk thing. If you have it, give it a whirl, and hope you can find a server with a few players in it.			",603,107,28,53,28,6,64

If we have to wait another 30 years for HL3 in exchange for Ricochet 2, I wouldn't complain at all. Probably the best video game known to man, let alone made by Valve.

												Honestly, don't buy just this game.  It's not worth how ever much they're asking.  However, if you get the half life bundle (great games, and probably less than 5 bucks on the steam summer / winter / whenever sale) try downloading it and playing it.  It's entertaining to try to play around with, it's pretty simple but hard to control.  It's worth the experience, and last I checked there are still servers up.			",1025,273,36,146,107,12,154

												Ricochet: Graphics are Old & Dated remind's me of the Tron Movie's, Music & Sound is like what you would hear from the Half-Life or Counter-Strike game's. The server's are like almost all but dead and some server's will have some bot's to kill, I was lucky first I found a server with just bot's. Then later I tired again and found a server with one person, then it grew into two and then three people. But it just doesn't have enough player's for me to keep this in my game list. Now down to business Ricochet is a 6 out of 10			",154,8,0,19,3,0,10

												Throughout my whole life, I have never been very good at frisbee. I have tried to join an ultimate frisbee team, tried to play frisbee at my school, and even watched both of the Tron movies twenty times over... but alas, I still cannot throw a frisbee straight. I thought my dream career of frisbee champion was destined to fail... until now. This game has taught me everything I need to know about throwing frisbees. I now know how to bounce frisbees off of walls, throw three fribees at once, and even decapiate people with frisbees. After only 30 minutes of playing this game, I have become the world Ultimate Frisbee champion. Thank you Ricochet... you have saved my dream... you have made my life worth living.10/10 IGN10/10 The Verge10/10 PCGamer10/10 Gameinformer 10/10 PCmagVery Positive Steam ReviewsWhere is Ricochet 2????

The soundtrack is unmatched, the mechanics, artful.

												Ok so.......this game should've been the 2015 GOTY.  Witcher Three has literally nothing on this.  Anyways when I was little boy I often dreamed of throwing discs at people and bouncing around.  Frisbee was a start but not what I truly desired.  Then I found it.  Ricochet.  Arguably the most graphicly intense game I've ever played.  You'll need at least two gigs of Ram.  And a GTX Titan Z.  Much like Ricochets gameplay, my review is bouncing all over the place.  Which brings me back to the flashback story.  After I tried Frisbee I found Ricochet.  But it took me years to build a monster capable of handling this beast.  And when I finally connected this year.   I WAS ASTOUNDED!  The community was so alive and large!  I found one player every sixty servers.  I was impressed at the hype and community that Valve had managed to build such an amazing fanbase.  They really should sue Tron but I think they take pity.  And with that I started playing a match.  It was like reaching enlightenment.  Discs were flying everywhere!  Left and right!  Even more left and right!  One perfect feature that adds to my immersion is the inability to throw discs up or down.  Because frankly that's just not how they were meant to be thrown.  Dank you Valve for this Magnum Opus of game development!   Final Verdict is a Yes out of Maybe.  Buy a four pack for your friends and get going on the empty one hundred servers!

												Ricochet is truly an underrated masterpiece.You play as an unnamed warrior, sent into outer space with no weapons or supplies, leaving you to scavenge loose discs left from broken ships. You learn to use these discs to fend off against enemies. The thing about this game, though, is its primary theme of isolation. Rarely will you encounter other forms of life, creating a lonely, brooding atmosphere, perfect for the game's outer space setting. For its price, I highly recommend Ricochet. Definitely Valve's greatest achievement.			",112,19,4,5,4,1,5

												Love this game, its just like Skyrim. just a little bit better. you can jump around on diffrent platforms while throwing glowing frisbee's at other players.  then they throw them back at you. sometimes you will fall of the platforms, but the game will teleport you back into the game again. its a really cool game, and you can ever choose the name of your frisbee guy! my name is frisbeeking247, add me if u want real competition, but plz pratice on noobs first. i prefer a real challenge!10/10 would play ",133,5,2,15,10,0,19

												Ricochet, one of valve's first projects, brings a whole new way to play games on all platforms with it's hectic gameplay, strong storyline and amazing graphics. The control feels good and fastly is learned by the most novice of players, while giving the most experienced gamers new ways to play games. The game is extremely well developed for it's time and has grown older like a good wine.A competitive, immersive action shooter that you dont want to miss.5 out of 4			",71,13,0,6,7,1,9

												I played this game so much back in its heyday. It centers around a misunderstood man, in a dead end job which requires him to throw discs at intergalactic mobsters that look just like him. It really has one of the most depressing stories that I have ever seen. The main focus of the game is to be as boring and sad as possible, it really shows a mirror to the working class society with how boring it is. Sometimes, I remember by youth and contemplate suicide because of this game, it really is THAT depressing. I'd recommend this game to you, if you like to be in a constant state of depression and boredom.Also, there is one map and the discs are utterly useless.   ",206,42,6,19,5,2,5

												This game is like ""Frisbee of Death Online 2000"", it is kind of fun to play and silly, it's engine holds up and it plays well. The game is also, like most multiplayer, much more fun with friends. There is no story to this game; you just throw disks at people to kill them while jumping on trampolines in some sort of Tron like virtual setting.Unfortunately I don't feel this game is actually worth anyone's time or money due to lack of quality.7/15 ""Frisbee of Death Online 2000""			",246,34,6,26,27,2,18

For a moment nothing happens and the world watches in anticipation.Suddenly Gabe Newell's face appears on the screen.""Valve is proud to announce a long anticipated game from a series that the fans have been excited to return to for many years.""He pauses for a moment and smiles, ""It was worth the wait.""Suddenly, men and women all over the world have earth shattering ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, all diseases are cured, world hunger is solved, and all wars instantly come to an end.""I am pleased to announce Ricochet 2.""

												DO NOT BUY! The game is dead. Not like TFC where there is still a small but thriving community left. The game is like ""I could probably count the playerbase on my fingers"" dead. The guts Valve has for charging 5 dollars for a game nobody plays. This game BEGS to become free to play. That is the only way I see this game ever being populated again.If you want good multiplayer GoldSrc game, get TFC or CS 1.6. They are 100 times more worth your investment.0/10 I cant even judge the game because there is nobody to play it with.			",23,1,0,1,1,0,2

												Oh boy, Ricochet.Ricochet is probably the worst Valve game ever. This game feels like Tron. You know Tron? Where the people ride disks and throw motorcycles? Its just like that, just without motorcycles and any servers with more than 5 people on it because this game is @$$. You bounce around on these little neon platforms and shoot disks at people. Its bad. This game seems like it would call a flash game site its home, afterall the game only takes up 16mb of space on your computer. Whats really sad is that this game costs $5 on Steam. Luckily I got it in bundle. There are few servers running that actually have people playing. When you get onto one of those you relize that there are no dedicated servers for this game. Everyone on the server is running 100+ ping. Everyone is named Player for some reason and no one demonstrates any kind of skill in game. I ended up at the top of the leader boards within 2 minutes of joining a server, with 300 ping. Without anykind of tutorial or campaign your left to figure things out by yourself. I still don't understand what I'm doing but I guess I'm doing the right things because I'm destroying everyone on the server.When you get tired of playing laggy multiplayer, you want to play with some skilled bots. Nope. No bots. ♥♥♥♥ this game man.			",99,3,2,1,7,0,1

This is way better than games such as Counter-Strike, simply because of the fact that this game is stacked with content and the community is thriving.

												Very bad effort of making a Tron-inspired minigame on the Half-Life engine.There is not a whole lot of variation - there are very few maps and they mostly play the same.The gameplay is the following: You jump from platform to platform, trying to kick players off of their platforms.You do this with discs that are heavily reminiscent of the ones from the movie Tron, that occasionally can get boosts or extra abilities.There might be fun to be had for a short while, but I could barely get 2 hours into this game and I've occasionally tried it again and again over the past 7 years.If you want to make maps that could potentially improve this dull game, then go ahead and buy it. Right now there is no reason to be playing this other than to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off with its dullness.			",277,42,6,22,14,2,35

												Yet again Valve Software brings us another timeless classic! Ricochet is a masterpiece that takes you on a journy between platforms both literally and figurativley. The way the frisbees are thrown and jumps are made are very symbolic of our everyday struggles. Throwing a fisbee represents our struggles in hitting our goals while the jumping represents our advances through our stages of life.

												This game is dead in modern day 2012. but if we weere to travel back a few years this is the review i would give it. waste of money, only 3 maps, you can only hop on big disc and throw rings at eachother that can only hit a target when you at the same level (like hight, theres liek no crosshairs or anything like that so you actaulyl have to try adn aim with notihng to use for reference. The only fun part it that when you die you get sucked in to space ad if a ring kills you your head gets decapitated. other than that.

												I've deleted my previous review and decided to write a new one!They're liars, money diggers, incompetent, and almost completely unprofessional however they have turned the game into something much better, the graphics are beautiful now and I can hardly notice any hackers around anymore.Here are the things you need to consider before buying this game though:1- You'll need a really good graphics card because the map isn't optimised and the fps will be low as ♥♥♥♥ so make sure you have a $100~$150 VGA Card at least (Like a GTX 950 or something and don't expect 60 fps), not because of the gaming experience and that ♥♥♥♥, it's just because if you play it on less than 70% render quality and low resolution you won't be able to see the difference between a player and a tree branch and you'll just keep dying without knowing who the f**k is shooting you and from where.2- You need friends to play this game otherwise your teammates will kill you or you'll get bored quick.3- Buy it on sale because it's not worth $20, unless you don't really care and want it bad.4- No matter how far we go, the game will always be glitchy as f**k and with every update they fix a few bugs and add a few more.5- Basically, don't expect that you'll be able to just launch the game and have a lot of fun at any time because no matter how good things are going, they always manage to f**k it up somehow!Buy the game ONLY if you have no problem with the things I've written above, especially #1!

												November 1, 2000 was a long, long, loooonnnggg time ago and it shows. The game has potential and should see a remake in the future, maybe on the next gen source but right now I just finished playing with two spanish guys and we were the only three people playing over all the servers. Sad but true.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I  know as of now I only have 10 minutes, but this game has a lot of potential. The basic map (haven't seen any others) consists of floating platforms that fling players into the air when they step on the triangles on them, Each platform has at least 2 triangles. There are some jump platforms on the walls that you can use to get to the top if you do it right.Your weapon is a disk that you can throw at enemies to either throw themoff during a jump, or directly kil them. When the pleyer falls, they see their character fall into a vortex.It seems to me like a phisics game built in an engine with bad physics. I think if someone could try to remake it in the source engine, it could be a lot cooler. Source is very much known for being used in physics games like Half-Life 2 and the Portal franchise. It could be much of an improvement over Richocet's current Quake (or whatever engine)'s phisics.			",190,14,2,16,11,0,3

												Ricochet is a weird game. You hop around on platforms in a futuristic setting and throw discs at other players, similar to Tron. This game is rather old, so the graphics aren't the greatest. The sound effects are lacking, and I don't recall any music. The biggest reason that I don't recommend this is because of the lack of servers. There were usually only 3-5 servers while I was playing, and most were empty or had a few bots. It would be nice if there was an offline mode with bots, but like many of the old goldsrc games, there is not. If you really want to try this out, you should definitely wait for a sale or get it in the Counter-Strike 1 Anthology.			",183,25,3,19,11,1,13

												Well, granted the game is an interesting idea. Maybe if it were redone, updated, and given new life, it would be worth playing.As it stands, the game is old... and dead. Next to nobody plays. And honestly, it's not too fun in the current form anyway. Many games nowadays are repetitive, but this is just boring repetitive. I have played a total of 5 minutes! That is next to nothing, but it was enough to see what the game is.In any case, nobody is going to buy this game by itself, I figure. It's just coming with the Valve Pack.			",159,61,0,14,6,1,6

												The game that pushed me to making a retro-Valve server group.  As simplistic as it gets, it's a no-nonsense projectile based shooter with jump pads, neon palettes, and powerups.  With only three maps, two modes, and not a lot of players, I'd recommend just picking up the Valve Complete Pack next time it goes on sale.			",220,27,4,11,15,2,25

												RIcochet!!! A unique game!!! REALLY GOOD GAMEPLAY! ONLY 1 MAP!!! PERFECT!! It even has, according to Gabe Newell: ""a giant story arch, a lot of twists and turns, and a very hard game to make!!! And if you liked this game, Gabe said that they are working on Ricochet 2!!! Great!!!~Not really, Ricochet is a new game, not a First Person Shooter... more like a First Person Jumper. I didn't like it. It's annoying. It gets me mad, even though i've only played it for 6 minutes. However, by seeing this game, you can tell that VALVe is great. Again. Why? Simple. Their minds are brilliant. Even though the game is bad and boring. Only VALVe (Gabe) could think in such a great game like Ricochet. Now please VALVe. Bring us Ricochet 2.I don't recommend it because i think it's not worth to buy it, only if you really want to support VALVe. I bought it with ""Counter-Strike Anthology"" thing. That's how i got it. But don't buy it, seriously.			",76,3,0,0,3,0,2

												It's a cool game with interesting mechanics, but I can never seem to find a decent server. People don't really play this game anymore, unfortunately. And, unfortunately, a multiplayer game needs players for it to be fun. I'm a sucker for Tron-style things, but this game is, sadly, a desolate wasteland in its current state. I probably would have had a blast with this game when it first came out, but I guess I came in too late.Maybe this review can be considered a recommendation for others to play it, so I can have the actual opportunity to give this game the chance it deserves.I, personally, am game for a Ricochet 2. Get on it, Valve. We all know you're not really working on finishing Half-life 2.			",1322,459,34,180,136,12,186

												This game was all the rage for about two weeks in the year 2000.  It was free.  I'm not sure if it was free for everybody or only if you had Team Fortress Classic.  Anyway, the community quickly died when everyone saw how bad the game was.  It was ripping off Tron, oddly enough.I don't know why they made this game.  It must have been testing something.  Unbelievably, Valve now charges for this game.  Who the hell is going to pay for a bad multiplayer-only game that nobody plays anymore?  Completely outrageous.Pwninator score: 1/10			",40,2,1,3,4,0,5

												The harm video games cause can be evaluated by several criteria, and the most obvious among them is the negative effects they can have on physical health. Though the proponents of video gaming claim first-person shooters and real-time strategies sharpen reflexes, increase concentration, and muscle coordination, in reality, teenagers who spend an ample amount of time playing games experience effects that are not so beneficial.There is a possibility of the loss of sight. Spending hours on a computer or in front of a TV is one of the main causes of blurred vision among youth. In addition, sacrificing healthy physical activities in favor of video gaming may become a risk factor for obesity. Gamers often do not want to interrupt their playing for meals. They eat right in front of the monitor, and their rations often consist of products that can be easily cooked or eaten immediately, such as crisps, chocolate bars, crackers, or other fast foods. All this definitely does not contribute to the proper and healthy development of a young, growing body.Mental health can also be affected by engaging in video games at a young age. This suggests addiction and inappropriate behavior. It is a well-known fact that many gamers (especially fans of online games) suffer from addiction, which is no less serious than narcomania or alcoholism. For instance, in August 2005, a report surfaced about the death of a 28-year-old southern Korean gamer who had spent 50 hours playing a real-time strategy game (BBC). For another significant example, one needs to look no further than July 2012, when a Taiwanese teenager fatally collapsed after a 40-hour game session (Crawley). Cases like these are quite numerous and happen all around the world. They make additional arguments to the negative evaluation of video games as an activity which brings harm to young people.In its turn, inappropriate behavior can be caused by violence in video games. According to research, children and teenagers who play violent video games tend to be more aggressive. They confront their teachers and peers more often and display a decline in academic achievements. Such psychological deviations also do not implicate video games as a constructive and useful occupation for young people (Crane).Individuals who spend excessive hours playing video games may lack the capability to distinguish between reality from fantasies. Video games often offer simplified and conditional models of environments, relationships, friendships, and rivalries. Gamers use these models to learn to interact with the world around them, and they often lack skills that would be developed by real life experience instead of the simulation (Crane). Therefore, it can be implied that another negative effect caused by video games is the inability of social adaptation on the part of the gamer.It can be concluded that video games are a form of entertainment which is not suitable for children and teenagers. This assessment is based on a number of negative consequences that excessive video gaming causes. Young people who spend an inexplicable sum of hours playing video games are observed to be prone to sight loss and obesity. In addition, they tend to be more aggressive than their peers who do not play video games, and they experience difficulties with social adaptation. Also, video games can lead to addictions that are no less serious than alcoholism or narcomania, as evidenced in recent media stories reporting on deaths among inveterate video gamers. This collection of facts contributes to the negative evaluation of video games as an unwholesome activity for children and teenagers.			",20,0,0,1,2,1,0

												well it has no story line no characters no explination about  what the hell is going on and no explination about what the hell you do. you open the game click find a server chooes oner of the 3 servers that run any of the 2 maps and then you spawn on a big disc thing and jump to other disc things and you shoot smaler disc things at other players to make them fall off the disc thing there standing on so they fall off and die. its like if they made a game of the film tron  this would be the online death match of that game. I got this game for 79p  downloaded it in 2 min played it and had no idear what the hell was going on but I would be lieing if i said i did not enjoy it. its the type of game you play for about 20 min or so when your bored. thats all i have to say			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THIS IS A LEGITIMATE REVIEW!Ricochet is one of those weird games that got overshadowed by other games of its time. Many people judge it after playing 2 seconds of it. Admittedly, I haven't played very much myself but I haver realized that if you get a couple of friends over and play this game, and I mean ACTUALLY play it, you realize that the game has a genuine appeal. It's not the most diverse nor the most aesthetically pleasing game of all time, but for all it is it's pretty damn fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is what i like to call a 'six second game'. You will spend 2 seconds insalling it (even on a toaster), 2 seconds realising that no one plays it and that its♥♥♥♥♥♥ and 2 seconds to uninstall it. I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy. This game could be used as a method of torture, If i ever install this game again i will have to cut off my hands as punishment. The first time i played this game i was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and confused that i paralized my legs. If it were at all possible to permanently delete a game from your steam library then i would. Why would valve inculde this peas of♥♥♥♥♥♥in the valve bundle. I have spent countless days trying to understand this game but would upo getting several STD's. 10/10 IGN			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first when I saw this game in the Valve Compete Pack I had purchased, I had no idea what it was. When I first started playing, I instantly fell in love.Sure, there might only be 6 people online, but 6 people is enough to have some fun bounding from platform to platform, throwing TRON frisbees at everyone you see.I don't reccomend you get this alone, for $5 USD, because I don't think it's worth that much.However, I completely do reccomend playing this game if you bought it in a pack or collection, like I did.9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It pains me to write a negative review of this game, because I had heard so much about it, and thought it would be one of those fun but small Valve games. Maybe like Portal, short but sweet, abrupt but poignant. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The game is tiny, even smaller than I expected, and for how few people still play it, five dollars may just be highway robbery.The whole game could be summed up as a barely more functional version of Tron: Deadly Discs on the Atari 2600. Sure there's a few powerups, two throwing modes and something like 5 maps, but it soon becomes clear that game theory prevails, and one or two powerups trump the others. Not to mention that every map feels the same, and they all play pretty identically as well.As if the gameplay needed someone to further sand down all the interesting corners, you can't actually aim the disc in this game. It's not like your Tron fantasy where you de-rez a guy mid air as he jumps over you. No, you only control the facing (or yaw) of the disc. There is no pitch control to be had. Every throw is projected perfectly flat from a height suspiciously close to crotch-level. It's a little disorienting and hard to predict.When I finally found a server with two or three players on it, we played on a map that featured jump-pads as a central gimmick. This would be fine if they worked. Half the time I found myself kicked into the abyss at no fault of my own. I tried not touching movement, I tried steering into it, away from it. Everything I did or did not do seemed to doom me to another ""suicide"".This game feels half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ which is not something I've come to expect from Valve. With how small and simplistic this game is, and how Valve professes their love for this game, I'm surprised they (or some fans) haven't remade it on the most recent version of Source. I guess if you want your Tron kick, you are best off looking elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Valve's award winning Ricochet might very well be the most impressive game ever created. Years later it is still unmatched when it comes to a multiplayer experience. After spending five minutes in a server with another Ricochet enthusiest I was convinced that the rest of my life is meaningless unless I dedicate to it to this game. If you have not played this game and yet have 3000 hours spectating Russian Swear Word Simulator 2 matches, I fear for your soul. brb bagel bites.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a total waste of 5 bucks on a game that literally no one plays anymore. All the servers are empty, the game mechanics and graphics are old and outdated, and it's just plain boring giving that the game has no ""bots"" option. I know it's a really old game, but seriously, I don't know why anyone would want to play this game anymore. It's like trying to play ""Chutes and Ladders"" or ""Bingo"" with your teenage friends. They probably haven't played those games in over 10 years and won't want to because they think its ""outdated"" or ""boring"" to them. I'd say the same for Counter-Strike for being an old game, but that game at least has an undieing community left from, even if the game came out BEFORE Ricochet. Ricochet though... yeah, there's not much of a big enough community that can sustain this game (If there was anything of a ""community"" left) Ricochet over the years wasn't able to keep the ""special key"" that's kept players STILL PLAYING Counter-Strike 1.6, and without that, well...Sure, I bet when this game came out it was HUGE. I can see that with the amount of servers still operating even after over 15 years of this game being released. But like I said, they're empty. I think it's about time that we just lend our closures to this dead game and just focus on other games that have WAY more content than what Ricochet has to offer. Sure, it's innovative, original, and... JK, no. It's pretty much ripping off one of Tron's titles that involves ""throwing discs"" (except for the maps and map mechanics, that, at least, is very creative)Oh, and BTW (sorry to say), this was probably the worst Valve game I've ever played. And that's probably saying a lot considering almost all of Valve's games are critically acclaimed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is strange, and it may not be the most exciting, but I keep coming back for it.Its an original idea all in all, but I think at this period, Valve wanted to release another game with CS 1.6, and HL. They may have been short of ideas and exhausted from the developing of the other games.Its a good game, solid, and has a decent player base.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a brilliant game. A game far more brilliant than the others out there. Why? It has discs. Discs which can obliterate the head of an individual within seconds. Discs that could send your joy and happiness flying away in an instant. And you're also standing on discs too! Discs which can send you flying to another disc! Sending you richochetting all over the place. Hah! Ricochet.Keep ricochettin'.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It pains me to write a negative review of this game, because I had heard so much about it, and thought it would be one of those fun but small Valve games. Maybe like Portal, short but sweet, abrupt but poignant. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The game is tiny, even smaller than I expected, and for how few people still play it, five dollars may just be highway robbery.The whole game could be summed up as a barely more functional version of Tron: Deadly Discs on the Atari 2600. Sure there's a few powerups, two throwing modes and something like 5 maps, but it soon becomes clear that game theory prevails, and one or two powerups trump the others. Not to mention that every map feels the same, and they all play pretty identically as well.As if the gameplay needed someone to further sand down all the interesting corners, you can't actually aim the disc in this game. It's not like your Tron fantasy where you de-rez a guy mid air as he jumps over you. No, you only control the facing (or yaw) of the disc. There is no pitch control to be had. Every throw is projected perfectly flat from a height suspiciously close to crotch-level. It's a little disorienting and hard to predict.When I finally found a server with two or three players on it, we played on a map that featured jump-pads as a central gimmick. This would be fine if they worked. Half the time I found myself kicked into the abyss at no fault of my own. I tried not touching movement, I tried steering into it, away from it. Everything I did or did not do seemed to doom me to another ""suicide"".This game feels half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ which is not something I've come to expect from Valve. With how small and simplistic this game is, and how Valve professes their love for this game, I'm surprised they (or some fans) haven't remade it on the most recent version of Source. I guess if you want your Tron kick, you are best off looking elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also another bad thing about this game you have to be at the same height as someone to be able to hit them cause if you are not at the same height in the map as someone with them being one platform above you then you can't hit them cause your throwing disk cannot go up it can only go straight in the direction you are facing and not up.

												Remembered playing it as a kid.Bought the valve complete pack without knowing what was in it.Saw this in my library today and asked when did that get there.Downloaded and launched in two minutes.1 person in a 30 minute game that is 15 minutes through.Died fifty times and killed zero. Man this sucks. I was stupid when I was a kid.Next game died twenty times. Killed 60. MAN THIS GAME IS AWSOME. I love my childhood.Seriously though. Get it on sale download it and log in ocasionally to see if anyone is playing. Then have fun with tron disc wars. And just think. Ricochet 2 confirmed. (Really theres was an interview with Gabe talking about. I mean it's not like he could be posibly talking about some other game.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is what i like to call a 'six second game'. You will spend 2 seconds insalling it (even on a toaster), 2 seconds realising that no one plays it and that its♥♥♥♥♥♥ and 2 seconds to uninstall it. I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy. This game could be used as a method of torture, If i ever install this game again i will have to cut off my hands as punishment. The first time i played this game i was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and confused that i paralized my legs. If it were at all possible to permanently delete a game from your steam library then i would. Why would valve inculde this peas of♥♥♥♥♥♥in the valve bundle. I have spent countless days trying to understand this game but would upo getting several STD's. 10/10 IGN			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most bizarre game I have ever played ( well, excluding that president's cat game, but you can't really compare these two). You play as a tall, scary and intimidating fellow with a very interesting hair cut. The goal is to...wait for it...  yes you guessed... tear your opponent to pieces with what seems to be a handful of deadly glow in the dark frisbees. Join the right server and cries of ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; by an OTT American announcer, will add to the confusion. Its probably even more strange playing it whilst drunk or high, but I've yet to try it, so if you can provide feedback on this, then do a public service and post your findings in a comment.

												To this day I got a very vague understanding of what this game is, what is happening on its (very few) confusing maps and what are you supposed to do in order to progress.From what I was able to comprehend the challenge consists of trying to figure out what is going on, aiming your attacks at your fellow players who are constantly on the move and jump around platforms very fast, remembering the map layout so that you can better adjust your movement, and trying not to accidentally fall off into pitch-black nowhere while moving yourself and dodging your opponent attacks.The attacks themselves are performed by launching some sort of futuristic bola (disc-shaped thingy) at other players with intent to throw them off of their platforms and make you score. Although it doesn’t seem to work all the time (?), or the hit detection is not very good/reliable.The point is that most of the time you need to “predict” your opponent’s future location and aim your disc accordingly as aiming at players directly would almost never work since the movement speed is just so fast and everything is so chaotic. That’s again why good knowldge of the map is a key since knowing where your opponent would most likely go increases your chances at hitting them with your disc significantly.But I’m sure there’s more to it as map design is pretty awkward and complicated. The above described process is pretty much all that happens each round of the game.Anyway, the game design is very convoluted and if I were to describe Ricochet with just one phrase, I’d say it’s an ill-conceived fusion of Tron, unfinished Half-Life Xen levels and Quake deathmatch happening inside some Black Mesa scientist’s drug-induced hallucination.There are simply much better puzzle games out there (Portal being a most obvious alternative) which have better environments, better (sane) game design and better gameplay.Actually, I’m not even sure how this got officially released. It appears that at some point Valve thought that they actually are making some good game rather than hacking together some perverted deathmatch mode for Half-Life. It should have been released as a free mod at most, serving as an example, – but even then it would still seem weird.It’s OK if you got it with your Valve pack purchase, but if you are bying it alone you are probably crazy or just very curious.

												This is a really skilled base game I love it! I joined a random server and there was this pro player f***ing us. I checked his profile and he had 2000 hrs on this game. The down side is that it's not so popular. I find servers with people on them sometimes but with only a few players. Anyways this game is lots of fun			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a sarcastic review of a video game product. This sarcastic review is directed at a dated game that computer software game developer ""Valve"" made named Ricochet. I say how this is better than another computer software game ""Valve"" has made that is named ""Half Life 2"", which has been commended for its very high production quality. I, of course, intend such in mocking jest. I also reference ""Shrek"", an animated movie made by movie studio ""Dreamworks"". This movie has been praised by children and adults alike due to the correct balancing of humor and plot in said movie. I am making this comment once again in jest, because the movie also has a somewhat unsettling following that has been made near memetic qualities due to popularity. I end up finishing off my review with a mockingly optimistic rating of 10 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a brilliant game. A game far more brilliant than the others out there. Why? It has discs. Discs which can obliterate the head of an individual within seconds. Discs that could send your joy and happiness flying away in an instant. And you're also standing on discs too! Discs which can send you flying to another disc! Sending you richochetting all over the place. Hah! Ricochet.Keep ricochettin'.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
