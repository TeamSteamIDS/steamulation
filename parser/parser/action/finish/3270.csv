												It's not as good as the original game, especially in level-design department (one level even is just slightly remade level from BOOH). But we have new toys (even if they are more like re-skins of our old toys), some new enemies, some new locations and same gameplay as in original. And these days we don't have enough of gameplay like that. This game made me realise how much i miss rhytm-jumping around the level and not be forced to press ""E"" everywhere.  Bosses now are almost straight-up damage soakers, but on the other hand puzzly bosses from originals, despite being somewhat interesting in concept, gave no clue what to do at all, unlike bosses in adventure-based games.Story is more coherent than in originals, but narrative is even worse - main hero just trying to cosplay Duke Nukem with all pop-culture references and quotes. In the end, you buy one - you get one. (And i needed one... or more.)Also totally not working with nvidia surround, despite what said on WSGF.			",1149,447,60,172,143,12,270

												A fan follow-up to a legendary game of the early 2000's. It may not be as amazing as the original, but it's still a really good shooter. Level designs are pretty decent, though some are somewhat boring-looking, like ""The Asteroids"", but there are some really good ones, like the valley sections of ""The Haunted Valley"" look really pretty, or the entirety of ""Studios"", dedicated to fighting older monsters on sets of previous levels, along with new enemies, which makes it a very clever variation of enemy recycling (it's done so well you can't even complain about it). Soundtrack is really great though, both ambient and fight.P.S. If you've never played Painkiller at all, and are looking for the game to introduce you to the franchise, I'd recommend starting with the original and it's expansion. ",80,27,1,6,4,5,8

												This just isn't my kind of game. If your into mindless fps then go for it. It just wasn't for me. There really was no planing at all, much less an actual story. you just go to a different level ever time. Kill different enemies while trying to figure out which gun is best. Serious Sam is superior in every way. It was fun, I guess, it just wasn't for me. At least, not this title. Pointless carnage is just not me. Sam has more tactics with enemies and you know how to use the guns best. This game you just jump around monsters blowing them to smithereens, wash, rinse, repeat. Thankfully I got my dollars worth. Still, I ought to give painkiller black edition a try.			",261,45,1,24,6,0,7

												Painkiller Overdose was released in 2007, three years after release of original Painkiller. It's a single-player ""old-school"" FPS with Deathmatch multiplayer. And a sequel or stand-alone second expansion pack for Painkiller. It started out as a mod, being made by fans effort, and then was made official.So, technical side of thing. Game is supposed to still work on newest systems. It even supports wide-screen resolutions, even though HUD will be stretched. So it all should be cool.Oh, and game is as bugged as it always was. It will crash on you. Randomly. Or in some cases always in same situations. Like, when you are trying to equip tarot card after beating some level and having some amount of gold. Nope, no idea what causes it, but you will relaunch game few times while beating it for sure.AND loooooong level loading times. I have no idea what changed, but these take few times more than in original Painkiller. It's painful enough to make you wish that this game had either ""rewind time"" or more console-like checkpoint system. Or just anything that doesn't require you to reload level after death. Like, lower difficulty to die less to. Yea, it's bad even today.Oh. And don't be surprised if ragdoll of defeated demon decides to kick you up to moon. Ragdolls don't feel done properly here.As for multiplayer? Well, it was mostly competive one like Deathmatch. And well, I don't think it was played like Painkiller was. And with GameSpy shut down, you can still connect, but Internet Browser will not work. So it will be hard to find servers with people. Community is probably dead there.Story follow Belial, child of demon and angel, who proved to be too powerful and chaotic-neutral in war between Heaven and Hell. Who was then imprisoned by Cerberus from Hell side, while being overseen by Samael from Heaven side. And now, after Lucifer death, he was freed and out for revenge. While travelling absolutely random locations.So, it adds whole new campaign made of 16 levels or so. On theory it's great. It has great variety, as you will travel between such locations as fantasy land, space station, egypt, riot in modern city, zombie town and it has such interesting and amazing stages as Demon Farm and B-Film Studios. And borefest of green radiation like Power Plant, yes. And not only that, but each level is filled with at least some unique monsters, scarabs at Desert or living cardboards of B-Film monsters.And yet all this random variety gives this game a cartoonish feel. What Hell? What Nightmare? Travelling around globe and time and dimension, it seems. It doesn't help that most monsters seem to be take off the wall, stereotype, futher contributing to this feel. Not that it's a bad thing.It also lost some feel due to different music, which is weaker. There are some interesting parts of fight music for some levels, but it's all errr ""bland epic"", so to say. Ambient part is weak too. Just nothing truly memoriable, so good bye awesome metal too.It'a also nice how few enemies, including old ones, gained a special death animations. Even though they are so slow at times, you may not notice that enemy is technically dead.But hey, the game has 8 weapons. Freaking eight. And knowing how seven of them has two alternative fire modes, which use serapate unqiue ammo, and seeing how weapon switching is instant, that pretty much means that you got 17 different fire modes that you have to remember and think about! It pretty much creates a ""having bunch of toys"" feeling. Sure, you have many different ways to kill demons. It's probably fun for most. But you see, since functionality and effectiveness pretty much always overlaps with few of them, you actually will be lost what to use. They all do fine job and nothing is absolutely more effective in each situation, so you don't really have to think on which weapon to choose. Which is one of the things that keeps old FPS interesting, having to decide on weapon use. Well, aside from running out from ammo for some.You will spend time scrolling around weapons to find the one with some ammo left. That's quite a lot. And game doesn't always provide you with enough ammo. Sometimes there is too much, other times it tries to give you only for some weapons and sometimes there is just plain crisis. Power Plant level comes to mind. It shows that this game started as a mod, as sometimes it feels amateurish with difficulty jump.And I don't understand the use of acid flame thrower.And yes, what I said, there is difficulty jumps. Some encounters will prove to be harder than others. And it's not always at the end of the levels. Like, it uses same Monks enemies in Ragnarog level. But this time, they didn't place any laying corpses around for them to be busy throwing, instead they will keep telekinetically shove player, doing hitscan damage on him from few miles away.And then you got easy-easy bosses. Who got weak points. At least they aren't the worst of Painkiller.And then there is a hero who tries to be baadass and Duke Nukem like, throwing one-liners regulary. Same ones. Not too clever. So get ready to hear ""taste like chicken"" a lot. He only rarely drops something more interesting like ""did that demon just revive another one?"".And sadly, despite having big themes variety, it just ends up being monotonous. Original game was avoiding that, it had few surprises. It had more specialized weapons, more varied monsters. It wasn't too chaotic in themes. It just had flow. While in Overdose it just feels like you kill things and then repeat, not really mattering what kills and how you kill. Or at least not enough mattering. I don't really understand, on theory it's awesome, but on practise it's not so fun. Levels also feel sometimes on dragged side. Weaker music don't help.And I wish weapons didn't gib everything just because.Getting Tarot Cards is still not so fun, by the way. Just like in original game.So, Overdose isn't a bad game. It's not good FPS either. It has variety in level themes, but it's too repetitive in gameplay. It's the kind of game that you will have fun with, but will have to force yourself with ""I should beat this game fully because I want to beat games"", otherwise you will abandon it in a half way.

												Considering it’s a fan made product and seeing how much they worked on it, this game is awesome! It has some flaws but still catches the Painkiller feeling even from the another view of a new bizzare but cool protagonist. A perfect descendant of the original.Pros:- Everything that was good in the original presented here as well. Level design, enemies weapons, sounds, athmosphere.- Graphics. They worked on this one very very hard and i say well done! Nearly everything has been redesigned to fit the new protagonist. Perfect!- Weapons. Old weapons with new look and minor new capabilities! The new weapons. . .Your first weapon (besides the redesigned cube) is a head of your gaoler. Most people notice it’s a cool laser shooter but the real fun starts with it’s alternate fire. It shouts on your enemies with a really scary-good sound effect, causing most basic enemies’ heart stopping (aren’t they dead already? oh well. . .) and insta-kill them into a shaking, painfull death. What a truly satisfying weapon! I could do that all day! And the new living grenade. . .- Cool new enemies. Oh Geishas. . .hehe!Cons:- Even more unbalanced enemies than in the original, more insta-killers on normal difficulty. The gang members and the flamethrowers (especially the miniboss) caused me practise violent vulgarisms but also made me stand up and relax a few mins so it was nearly healthy.8/10 – Fun oldskool FPS(Sorry for my English!)

												The game has some beautiful level aesthetics and monster designs, which is almost a shame, because everything about the actual gameplay is so bad that these great assets are just wasted.Even on normal difficulty, you'll find yourself running out of ammo for not just your favorite weapon, but for all half dozen separate weapons extremely frequently - including secondary ammo!  You are simply not given enough bullets to work with, turning what should be tense or exciting fights against dozens of enemies into pure frustration as you run around looking for what few ammo pickups have been hidden across the large expanses.While being forced to make the best of it with your infinite ammo starter weapon, you'll have to slog your way through countless bullet spongey enemies, many of which spawn adjacent to you, teleport or use incredibly hard to see projectiles.  Unfortunately, your character, who seems defined primarily by his ability to recycle the same three or four unpleasantly dull one liners throughout the whole game, is not nearly tanky enough to deal with these battles very well.Finally, even the weapons are merely recycled clones of Painkiller Black's arsenal, making them not so much new as modded.The not too shabby presentation of this game is let down by almost everything else about it, but especially by the total lack of respect for the player given in the design of enemy encounters.  Mixing and matching the strict ammo rationing of a Silent Hill game with the relentless hordes of a Serious Sam makes for a poor FPS experience, whether you're oldschool or new school.

												TL;DR  Game is good and balanced, if not appealing to everyoneFirst of all, Painkiller: Black Edition is almost universally accepted as the better game. If you're gonna choose only one, get the original (also on steam).The rest of this review is the BS people are complaining about.Now to the people complaining about difficulty, weapons, etc. Yes the weapons are a little weak, but you get so much ammo and all of the enemies can be lead like sheep. You can hold every weapon at once and always have the melee/death-ray cube thing with unlimited ammo (its ♥♥♥♥ing strong too), so if you have ammo issues, your aim is abysmal. Really abysmal.As for the difficulty: Enemies with melee attacks are strong because they should never catch up to you. Seriously, you can bunny hop more than twice as fast as they walk. You even slide up and over enemies when you jump.. Even when you do get hit it takes at least 10 hits to kill you from the standard 100 HP (max HP is something between 150-250, I've never really paid attention) PLUS armour.. And if you still can't handle the enemies, there's a difficulty setting for a reason.The load times are fine. The one guy saying the times are 10+ minutes must have a hamster instead of a processor. The load times are a little longer than most, but theyre fine.Enemy variants are plentiful (new enemies every level so far).Overall there are 17 levels, 20 minutes or more each. Even rushing through the game, you get 5+ hours of gameplay.Recomended (but Painkiller: Black beats Overdoes)			",131,9,1,14,7,0,6

												AUDIO:Various styles ranging from heavy metal, carnival music, and spooky haunted house style stuff that fits the level that you are in. There is a lot of variety here and it's nice to have so many different songs to kill baddies to. Belial is a one-liner spewing jerk throughout the game. It's nice to hear him comment at the beginning of every level because it can be humorous and it gives him personality, but good lord he never shuts up while you're playing. I LOVE THE TASTE OF EVIL SOULS IN THE MORNING.VISUALS:Like the original Painkiller, Overdose offers a plethora of different environments to gib enemies in. A snowy viking village, the battlefields of the American Civil War, and a movie studio production lot to name a few. Every level is drastically different in theme from the previous one, so it offers a good incentive to keep going and see just how diverse this game can get. The enemies change every level to match the setting, so you won't really run into them multiple times except in a level near the end. PLAYABLILITY:This game does have a tendency to get hair-rippingly difficult at times. Mainly when they pit you against a horde of enemies that have some sort of quirk that melts your health to nothing in no time flat in a claustrophobic environment. Like the Riot level. Those flamethrower enemies are ridiculous. Aside from that little balancing issue, it is the same frantic and fast paced gameplay as the original Painkiller. DELIVERY:The gameplay is very similar to the Serious Sam line of games, just set to a darker tone. There is a pretty large variety of weapons to choose from; some a bit more useful than others. If you've played the original Painkiller, they're basically just reskins of those weapons. Each level offers you a challenge to complete in order to unlock Cards which can be used to grant you special powers, such as faster speed or changing how much damage you do. Overdose is the type of game that focuses more on its gameplay than its story, with maybe 4 total cutscenes in the whole game that sum up the story to that point. Easy to understand and doesn't take itself very seriously.SUMMARY: So the big question is: Should you play this game? My answer to you is that you should go decide if you want to play Painkiller: Black Edition first. If you play through that and need more Painkiller to satiate your appetite, then give this a whirl. it's not as balanced or polished as Black Edition is, but it is still fun to give a playthrough. If you didn't like Black Edition, than you are sure as hell not going to like this one. It is a game with flaws, but it still pulls through in the end. Final Score: 7/10			",169,42,2,38,15,2,46

												Not quite Black Edition, but still fun. Painkiller was an absurdly fun game, and Overdose is more of that. Its not quite as good as Black Edition, but given that Black Edition was absolutely awesome, not quite reaching the same level is understandable. The weapons are mostly reskinned, but every one of them is a little bit less awesome. The incredible stake gun, for example, is replaced by a chinese fireworks launcher, which while neat, doesnt give the satisfaction of seeing an entire tree pin a guy to a wall. If you've played through Black Edition already, and want a little more, give it a shot.			",255,14,6,15,6,1,16

												More of a large expansion or total conversion than a true sequel. It's on the same engine, it has the same gameplay, the content, however is mostly new (also, it's from a different studio). Let's call it a spinoff. This time, you play as... honestly, who cares? Painkiller is about fast past, non-stop fps action, and on that front, Overdose definitely delivers. Still, the originial is miles ahead of this. It had better level design, architecture, modelling, and overall better gameplay. Even if it was quite unbalanced, when it came to difficulty - Overdose, however is all Over the place in that aspect (the final bossfight is the most ridiculous thing I've ever encountered). The first step in turning Painkiller into a repetitive arena-shooter was Battle out of hell, this is the second step. Thankfully, It's still a long way until Recurring evil (which was just garbage), but the Painkiller games were slowly but surely losing their edge at this point. I had no idea how perfect the original Painkiller was, until i played this spinoff. Up until then it felt like a dumb, simple, but fun game. Compared to Overdose, it's brilliance truly shines through. By no means Overdose is a bad game, but it is a disappointing continuation of the Painkiller games.			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												An unnecessary expansion pack to a great old-school FPS shooter developed 10 years ago. While the game was advertised as having new levels, weapons and enemy types I did not find many of these original. Simply put: Painkiller was not a new thing back in 2007. Other FPS games were announced / released and my attention was on them instead of the arrival of the 2nd expansion pack. Also, Battle Out Of Hell was an exceptionally good expansion pack that was an appropriate finish to this franchise. But starting with Overdose a series of additional expansion packs were unleashed later on (follow-up games in order: Redemption, Resurrection, Recurring Evil) that tried to improve upon the original Painkiller experience but tried so desperately and so hard that eventually they ended up ruining this name.Overdose was the first and the only that probably was not a failure in its entirety. It was just mediocre and made me realise the vanilla game along with its expansion were much, much better.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												This game is the hideous abomination of the Painkiller series. Seriously, calling this part overdose only makes you think that you have been overdosed by Jenkem because this part is pure sh`t. Cancerous *new weapons*, the game itself just boring comparing to the 1st 2 parts of the series. Some people say that there is one fun level with airships, but truly said, I got this game like 10 years ago on DVD, I was unable to get to that level, because of how bad and boring this game is - I can't force myself to play long enough. Even low price at the steam store is not the reason to get this game, you will get nothing but negative emotions.			",2056,824,59,208,221,16,291

												If you're looking for a challenging, fast paced old school FPS with cool weapons, tonnes of enemies to kill and a great art design, Painkiller Overdose is the game for you. There are lots of collectables to find along the way, rewarding players for exploring the maps. This keeps the pacing of the gameplay steady and allows you to take a few deep breaths after murdering countless demons and trust me, you'll need to. Enemy ai isn't the best but they will team up to ko you. Some enemies have tricks up their sleeve to be careful of. Plus there are many environmental hazards to look out for such as lava, swinging maces etc. There are also tarot cards to collect which give you special powers when activated once per level. These cards are permenant and you can unlock them by satisfying certain conditions at the end of a level. The weapons are cooler than ever, you will get some really creative ones to try as well as your conventional shotgun. Levels are well designed and have lots of hidden ammo/secrets and tonnes of enemies to kill.Another thing to note is that the protagonist, Belial who just happeneds to be a demon/angel hybrid is a far more entertaining character than Daniel and has the tendancy to deliver one liners every now and again, particularly after consuming his favourite food, evil souls and he makes this very clear.The only downsides are the framerate drop which often occurs when enemies spawn into the map. This can be annoying and can break you away from the action sometimes. Plus the enemy ai can be pretty stupid when it comes to pathing, something you'll find in most painkiller titles, enemies will lose track of you easily. Also be careful with your saves. always delete the ones you don't need as the game has the tendancy to corrupt data and crash the game when too many sames are accumilated. One level in particular, Animal Farm has an awful save glitch which can corrupt data randomly on that level, basically you're required to beat it all in one sitting with no deaths as i guarrentee 80% of the time, the checkpoint autosaves will get corrupted, if you want to get the tarot card on that level, i strongly reccommend playing it on daydream to save yourself the frustration of dying and having to return to the beginning of the level.Other than that, this game is worth picking up if you are looking for a cheap old school shooter with a twist. Pick up the black edition too.			",65,4,0,11,2,0,3

												for maybe a half an hour at a time. It’s an extremely intense game that provides several hours of entertainment. Ultimately, hardcore shooting fans with a taste for that semi-stupor brought on by incessant gunplay and bloodletting will devour what Painkiller has to offer and come back for seconds :)			",147,55,3,17,17,0,26

												If you can get over the constant game crashes and the mind numbingly slow loading times, I highly recommend this game. Like the original Painkiller, the amount of enemies is incredible and the environments are colorful and intriguing. The gameplay is frantic and over-the-top.			",217,16,4,12,5,0,1

												Best Painkiller in the franchise. I know it is because I bought the entire package, I played all of them. This is the best.Much better level design than any other. Alot of gameplay time. Big variety of enemies. Big variety of guns.Personal opinion:I like Serious Sam better. It's much better in design and sound, and the protagonist is not that ugly. And there are scenes where this game really rips off Serious Sam. Like in the desert where beast skeletons run at you that remind me too much of Kleers. Or people with small saws instead of heads. Yeah, if you played Serious Sam and want something like that or like the Painkiller franchise, get this.Otherwise, get Serious damn Sam.			",188,29,2,10,13,1,4

												Divertido en algunos escenarios, mediocre en otros niveles. Porque tiene muchos enemigos, unos mejores que otros, lo malo es que tiene niveles de relleno que no tienen nada que ver con el satanismo que tiene la saga y decepcionan (el nivel del bosque y el nivel dedicado a lovecraft) y otros que son geniales (el nivel de japón y la granja). Por cierto, no se porque muchos enemigos no se remasterizan en la versión H&D.6.5/10 ",600,269,24,65,73,10,96

												An astounding sequel to one of my favorite FPS. The Level design is outstanding, bringing even more variety to an already varied product. The one liners on the part of the protagonist Belial are hilarious and the new guns are beautiful. Overdose is exactly what I would have preferred out of a Painkiller sequel and Belial is definitely one of my favorite characters in the Painkiller Universe.			",405,27,4,48,17,0,24

												To start: I used to add a much longer header to these reviews, but I've opted to keep it on my Backloggery page for the sake of brevity. Also, I had written a review for Painkiller: Black Edition, but Steam Reviews were glitchy and saying I hadn't played the game for more than five minutes (which I had played MUCH more than), so I just uploaded that review to PasteBin. Here's the last bit of the URL; you should know what to do with it: yyxEHtWBGameplay: Since this game is an expansion, I'll be writing the gameplay section assuming you've read the prior review or know what Painkiller is all about, as things really haven't changed too terribly much. However, saying that nothing has changed is a disservice, honestly. There are a lot of ""carry-over"" weapons, such as the Shotgun/Freeze Ray and the Rocket Launcher/Chaingun, but there are a lot of weapons that were either tweaked to make them more fun or were changed for the most part, such as the ever-unloved Stakegun being changed to a toxic waste launcher and the crossbow sniper having the alt-fire of the Stakegun. You've also got grenades which pretty much for me became the ""I'm out of rockets, so here's another source of boom."" The titular Painkiller has been changed to a Razor Cube, but it's still functionally the same.As far as the enemies go, there's still quite the variety. When the game introduced as much stuff as it did in Chapter 1, I was afraid that it was gonna spend itself too quickly. Fortunately, this wasn't the case. Most of these enemies are pretty fun to fight, but some of them are just plain obnoxious. Pretty much par for the course for the Painkiller series, though. The boss fights aren't nearly as cool as the boss fights from the original, and DEFINITELY not as cool as Battle Out of Hell's boss. In fact, the first boss is pretty much a throwaway one, as it is literally just a really big version of an enemy from the first level. The second one is pretty neat, but the third one isn't really all that good. Again, it's like the Battle Out of Hell boss in that you've gotta wait to be able to attack it, but unlike in BOoH, you can't influence the boss becoming vulnerable. It's just a matter of waiting around for the boss to make itself vulnerable.Somebody made the comparison to Rise of the Triad (presumably ROTT '95 and not ROTT '13, 'cuz ROTT '13 owned) in the review section, and I really think that's the most apt comparison you can make. Chapter 1 in terms of stage design is pretty great, Chapter 2 is somewhat less great but still pretty alright, Chapter 3 becomes the point where you're saying, ""I just want this game to be over with."" If Chapter 1 were released shareware, I'd say go get that. However, I still overall had a pretty good time with this game, even if my enjoyment declined over the span of the game for various reasons. If you're a fan of the original Painkiller and you just want more, I'd say you'd be alright with getting this. 7/10.Story: Basically, Belial be belligerant toward Samael (and yes, that was a forced alliteration). Fortunately, the cutscenes don't crash the game this time around. However, I skipped them due to lack of interest as the story really isn't very good. Honestly, these games shouldn't even have a story. Just make it a bunch of levels. Since the game did try and have a story, though, I'll talk about it. As for the dialogue, it gets REALLY tiresome. Basically, Belial tries to be Duke Nukem and make ""witty"" one liners all the time. To paraphrase one of Claptrap's lines from Poker Night 2, ""SHUT THE FSCK UP, BELIAL! Sheesh, and people say I'm annoying!"" 5/10.Graphics: Fortunately, the art design is still as fantastic as the original's. Enemies look really awesome, the stages are usually pretty huge, and the game overall just looks like every metal video ever. Just the way it should be. Fortunately, the weird screen shake glitch didn't happen like it did in the original. I still turned it off, as it really was just more annoying than anything else. As for the technical side of things, this game does require a bit of juice to get going, but as long as you've got what the recommended card is on the Steam page, you should be just fine. I didn't really experience any graphical glitches, although there was some portions of 2-5 that caused a considerable amount of lag for no reason whatsoever. This was only a two or three minute stretch of the game, so I'd consider it inconsequential. Overall, this game still manages to hold the high standard that one would expect from Painkiller's graphical capabilities. It's definitely a game that'll still look pretty awesome in five or ten years time. 5/5.Sound: This game has a real big issue with peak limiting. Like seriously, it got so bad at times that I had to turn off the game audio, as it was hurting my ears. I don't know why, though. 3-5 was the biggest culprit of this issue, so be warned. Anyways, the soundtrack is a bit... different this time around. Rather than going SO METAL, the composer decided to branch out a little bit. In fact, there really isn't any metal tracks in the game at all, save for the one from the repeat level from BOoH (oh yeah, did I mention this game lifts a level from BOoH?). While the change is nice, it runs the risk of being forgettable and not necessarily conducive to what's going on in the game. And to be honest, I really can't remember a single song from this game, whereas in the original, the songs may have gotten tired after a while, but there's a lot of memorable riffs in there. It's not a soundtrack I'd get for myself. As for the voice acting, again the main issue is the dialogue the one VA has to work with, so it's a bit tricky for me to pass judgement on the quality of the VAs. However, what I can pass judgement on are the audio engine and the soundtrack, which are both honestly pretty disappointing. 2/5.Overall scores are: 7/5/5/2; cumulative score of 6.3/10. It's not something I'd see myself replaying too terribly often, but I don't feel bad about spending my time playing it, either. If you like Painkiller, you might like this. You've probably already got the Painkiller Pack that goes on sale quite often, so you might as well dive in. It's better than a lot of modern shooters, that's for sure.			",508,69,16,41,32,3,65

												I can’t recommend it even though I like it. This game would be a ‘8.5/10’ for me, if it were not for three things.First, the loading times. After being killed, re-loading takes almost 37 seconds, and you have to concentrate. If you start daydreaming the game loads and you’re not ready. Second. The difficulty levels could use another level. There are four. I like to play about half difficulty, or just over. Here second level feels too easy, and gives you a full health at every checkpoint. Third level, is about right. It makes you feel you have to hammer the baddies. Only when it gets tough, and you start dying, then re-loading kills enthusiasm.Thirdly, there are two nasty bugs in loading saved files. One is in the  level Dead Marsh, you have to play about three checkpoints without being able to load a saved file. The other is reported only in the Steam release of Painkiller in the level  Animal Farm. I finished the level before I saved to load, or quit. (Just in case.)Otherwise, I quite love this game. Sadly though with all it faults 5/10 at best. I've played the three quarters of the game so far. The good parts are great though, like eerie wooden buildings, and levels in different places in time.Also I could really use a game manual on this one. There are tarot cards, which you win and have bonus effects, and we need the info on them.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mindware Studios foreshadow the sullen, depressing future of the Painkiller series with their clumsy and uninspired misfire of a sequel. Aside from a few aesthetically pleasing and well-designed levels/enemies, everything else falls flat. Unbalanced weapons, erratic difficulty spikes, atrocious boss battles and an aggressively unlikeable, annoying main character, mix together in a fetid cauldron to produce the hideous slime that is Painkiller Overdose. While the core gameplay still remains largely intact, it can't shine through the heavy layering of all the negative components.It would be impossible to overdose on this pill, as it lacks any addictive qualities.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, after a lot of poking around you CAN MAKE BELIAL SHUT THE HELL UP WITH THE ONE LINERS.  Only one way I found that works though.http://pkzone.org/downloads/powermad-overdose/Overlay called PowerMad for Overdose that lets you mess around with a lot of settings that the retail copy disabled for some who the heck knows why reason, as well as correcting a few of the weirder ammo placement/etc. bugs.Check the instructions for using it with steam for how to do it after downloading and installing.  The ONLY way I actually got it work with Steam was by using the first 'rename powermad.pak into LScripts.pak' method.  Not the most elegant solution, but since the only thing it goofs up is online play who cares.  (Not like there are any servers for online play anyway it seems.)Command to make him stop once you get it all installed and the game running is to hit tilde (the ~ key) and type pmtrashtalk.  (Relative) peace and quiet FTW.Totally worth it to make the idiot shut his half-demon half-angel annoying GD mouth.			",187,20,0,21,1,1,0

												  This game blows. It oscilates between stupidly easy, and stupidly difficult. The monster design is not at all thought out like the previous games.  There are giant enemies who you shoot once with anything and they have to go into a 2 second yelp animation where they are completely helpless and basically stun-locked by any weapon you choose. Then there are several enemies who go invisible and then pop out of invisibility right next to you while doing damage.  This makes no sense. There is no tracking the enemy or countering this. They just do it and you have to hope you're beefy enough to soak the damage. Where as in previous games you could dodge, plan your movement and with skill avoid your enemies, now theres just too many enemies who auto- hit no matter what you do.  Terrible design flaws in game play make this a 4/10 game.			",16,2,1,4,2,0,2

												Imagine, if you will, a man in a suit and tie walks up to you. He is holding a clipboard, and has a pen at the ready. He asks you a question. ""What did you like about Painkiller?"" You excitedly begin listing off answers. ""The music!"" you say, ""the fun weapons!"" you exclaim, ""the fact that they realized nobody cares about the 'plot' or wants to hear from the character you're playing as!"" you shout. The suited man, all the while, is nodding furiously and writing your answers down. He thanks you for your time and promptly leaves. He walks down the street, and enters a building with a large sign reading ""Mindware Studios."" He makes his way to large conference room, full of more suited men, eagerly waiting to hear what he has to say.The man takes the paper he was writing on, places it on the conference table, squats over it, and takes a great big dump on it. The room breaks out into applause and proceeds to create this godawful game.			",234,41,4,5,9,3,5

I don't remember how little I paid for this one, but it was still too much. While the graphics are attractive, the gameplay is just a rehash of the first one and gets old very quickly.

												I had a great time with Painkiller Overdose and I still play it to improve my scores and try higher difficulties.I have tried Black Edition and I agree it's the better version, but this game has a quicker more arcade feel to it that I enjoy.For those unfamiliar with this series, Painkiller is a fast paced arena style FPS (first person shooter), and I would compare it to Quake 3 in terms of controls and jumping.There are 17 maps in 3 chapters (or so) with a couple bosses and tons of unique and creative enemies. You have a lot of weapons to use, and some hidden secrets and pickups in the maps. You will find some weapons work better on enemies than others as you play which is quite satisfying.This game has great sound effects, great graphics, and lots of blood and gore.Multiplayer is dead unless you add friends to play with and play via IP address. Gamespy ran the master servers but they have been taken down. You may encounter problems hosting if you are using a router.Overdose is cheaper than Black Edition,  don't pass this one up, it's very fun.			",32,9,2,25,0,0,10

												Steam doesn't record my playtime for Painkiller Black Edition, so consider this both a review of that and this expansion.Awful enemy design. Compare it to games like Serious Sam or Duke Nukem, who both had enemies that were distinctly different from each other and easily displayed what sort of attacks they had. Instead, the obsession with having unique enemies for practically every level leads to boring and indistinct variations of ""brown and grey spoopy thing"" that often have attacks that aren't readily apparent. Also, most of the enemies with guns are hitscan. Combine this with level design that often borderlines on claustrophobic and you've got a game that falls flat on its face as a horde shooter.The main game is slightly better than the expansion; some of the levels are actually nicely designed, and you aren't being peppered with the same 5 one-liners every 2 minutes, but it still suffers from the awful enemy design. If you do get any Painkiller game, get Black Edition and stop there.			",2310,879,81,245,235,24,319

												More varied than the first game, Overdose almost entirely uses original enemies and doesn't endlessly recycle enemy design like the other expansions Resurrection, Redemption and Recurring Evil seem to do. There are many lovely vistas to see: the levels take you to a Japanese village, nuclear plant, farm, Pompeii, battle during American Civil War and other authentic locations. Most weapons, but not all, are comparable, if not identical in functionality to their Painkiller counterparts, but the weapon models are carefully recreated. Ammo is scarcer than in the original, I felt that this design choice encourages creativity by forcing the player to use all weapons. Graphics are noticeably upgraded over PK1, but unfortunately the frame rate fluctuates, in particular on the Haunted Valley level most likely due to heavy particle effect usage.Farm stage is the standout, featuring some truly bizarre, twisted design also found in the Killing Floor series.

												Bought in the the sale. Well, i must say, its not a bad buy, pretty easy game, just that it would be better if ammo and health packs are avaliable more often during the run of the game, but overall, the graphics are passable, game play ain't too bad. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Steam doesn't record my playtime for Painkiller Black Edition, so consider this both a review of that and this expansion.Awful enemy design. Compare it to games like Serious Sam or Duke Nukem, who both had enemies that were distinctly different from each other and easily displayed what sort of attacks they had. Instead, the obsession with having unique enemies for practically every level leads to boring and indistinct variations of ""brown and grey spoopy thing"" that often have attacks that aren't readily apparent. Also, most of the enemies with guns are hitscan. Combine this with level design that often borderlines on claustrophobic and you've got a game that falls flat on its face as a horde shooter.The main game is slightly better than the expansion; some of the levels are actually nicely designed, and you aren't being peppered with the same 5 one-liners every 2 minutes, but it still suffers from the awful enemy design. If you do get any Painkiller game, get Black Edition and stop there.			",2310,879,81,245,235,24,319

												Painkiller, když se řekne tohle jméno, napadne vás jistě tato série her. V tomto doporučení se konkrétně budeme bavit o dílu s názvem Overdose. Takže vemu to stručně a z lehka. Nejlepší hra toto určitě není, hra se autosavuje každou takovou ""část"" v lvlu a to každou tu část máte s větším střílecím skillem za 5 minut hotovou. Grafika je v Overdose zrovna jedna z těch lepších když se to porovná s ostatními díly (mimo H&D). Hratelnost je opět jednoduchá s nějakými podivnými prvky (jako CTRL rychlá střelba z brokovnice). Bohužel tuto hru nemohu silně doporučit, ale za tak malou cenu to zkusit mužete. Hra ale po čase celkem omrzí, ale nepřátelé jsou vážně zajímavý, prostředí také, a ikdyž vubec nevíte proč a k čemu zabíjete ty peklelné nestvůry, stejně vás to ani nějak zajímat nebude.Overdose je opět další procházečka kde střílíte vše kolem sebe, sbíráte bonusy a postupujete dalšímy lvly.  Takže zkusit mužete, ale jestli vás to bude bavit, to zaručit nemohu.			",225,24,8,15,7,2,9

												Im a great Fan of Painkiller. The first title from Painkiller is still my favorite but on this part, i had more Fun.I pretty like the Stages of this Part. They are just more different and more enjoyable. The new Weapons are cool too.Heavons got a Hitman... with a Shotgun and a face of someone who is taking his Job serious... and he didnt become afraid.			",216,20,2,18,10,2,11

												From a technical standpoint this game has some serious bugs. Like the crash after you try to place a tarot card or if you attack in demon mode (you'll be perfectly fine in demon mode, if you stand quietly and don't attack anybody). Also there are some completely random crashes.And yet still I recommend this game. Those crashes are annoying and I assume they can be gamebreaking in harder difficulty modes, but in Insomnia I enjoyed PK Overdose in spite of that. Tons of new enemies (or at least creative reskins), some new weapons (and some creative reskins). 16 new levels (two of them partially reused assets from BK: Black Edition). Nice enough pacing and no desperate ammo scavenging.			",224,70,3,23,14,2,24

												An astounding sequel to one of my favorite FPS. The Level design is outstanding, bringing even more variety to an already varied product. The one liners on the part of the protagonist Belial are hilarious and the new guns are beautiful. Overdose is exactly what I would have preferred out of a Painkiller sequel and Belial is definitely one of my favorite characters in the Painkiller Universe.			",47,6,1,15,3,0,2
