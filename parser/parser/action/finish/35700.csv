AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Trine Enchanted Edition Original Release: 2009 Genre Tags: Platformer; Adventure; Puzzle; Coop; Beautiful Artwork   My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 12-30 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamers; Multiplayer gamers REVIEWTrine is a light game that is easy to digest but offers gripping visuals, a mystical atmosphere, and enticing gameplay.  All of the features of the game are simple in design but intricate in execution.  The gameplay, aesthetics, and narrative all come together to create a whimsical and charming adventure. I highly recommend this for all gamers to consider; and for fans of the genre it is a sure bet.By far the best aspects of the game are the stunning visuals and alluring atmospheric presentation of the setting. Each and every environment you explore is diverse, captivating, and charming. The ambiance really captures the mystical aura of the game perfectly. Trine easily has one of the most immersive 2D gameworlds I have encountered in video games.The gameplay is light and quick to grasp. Anyone should be able to dive right in, regardless of ability level. But various difficulty levels and a ""hardcore"" mode ensure that skilled players can still find a challenge. And whether you are playing on “easy” or “hardcore,” the gameplay is entertaining. Mixing elements of platforming, action, and puzzle solving with the unique identity of the game establishes an experience that is simultaneously familiar and novel— and irrefutably fun.The story is whimsical and fantastic; and the characters are pleasant and endearing. This synergizes well with the aforementioned atmosphere to establish an amusing fantasy experience. But it also remains light and relaxed, and never takes itself too seriously.  So even casual fans of fantasy will enjoy the narrative.Trine is definitely a worthy pick-up. No matter what your standard preferences are, you should give this game some consideration. Check it out.Addendum:  The game was upgraded to a better engine and to add online coop. The new cooperative mode adds an extra layer of possibilities, as the unique gameplay is a joy to experience with friends.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Trine is a puzzle platformer with some action thrown in there. You have three characters that you can switch between on the fly, similar to the old Lost Vikings game. You first have the most useful class, the Thief that can use a grappling hook to wooden ledges, a bow, and a flaming bow to light torches. Then you have the wizard that can magically make boxes by clicking or holding the right trigger and draw a box. You can also draw platforms and click and drag specific things to move them or get them out of your way. You can use your boxes and platforms to crush enemies. These first two classes are a lot of fun and have a lot of depth, but then we get to the third class / character, the warrior. He is just your straight up sword swinger, effective melee character.... with a shield that seems pretty useless.The game is very beautiful, bright and vibrant. It is also very physics based and the physics feel nice. There are nice visuals with diverse settings and instead of cut scenes, the game just uses narrations as you play, which I greatly prefer. Since it is so visually beautiful, it can be a beast on lesser video cards, even at the lowest setting. Your platforms and boxes crush enemies, objects can be thrown into enemies or through destructible walls, the grappling hook lets you swing, and you can wrap hanging spike traps around platforms so they don't fall. I seemed to get the most fun out of unintentional things, such as teeter tauter platforms combine with Ferris wheel like platforms coupled with skeleton warriors jumping and sliding around to fill the room. The platforming dynamic of moving physics based platforming was a lot of fun.The controls are very simple, and a controller is highly recommended. You have a jump button, a change weapon button, a trigger for drawing boxes or a grappling hook, two shift character buttons, the left stick controls the character, the right stick is like an aim for the bow, to draw platforms and to aim your shield (which is useless when you can easily dodge attacks). You can aim the bow and the longer you aim it, the further the arrow goes. If you don't like switching between characters, you can also play with a friend, but it is sad there is no online co-op.Each character has their own health and mana bar, but the mana never really seems to run out with enemies constantly dropping potions. If one character dies, they're dead until you reach a checkpoint, even previous checkpoints. If all three characters die, then you simply restart at the last checkpoint. Its a forgiving system, which I'm happy about.As you progress through the game, you'll level up to get your choice of skill upgrades. You'll also find new tricks and skills.The enemies seem competent and dangerous enough. The basic enemy is the skeleton that comes in four flavors, standard, shielded, archer and pyro. They will jump over pits, climb, fall and do everything to get to you (except archers that stand and shoot). The enemy AI seems good enough so every situation can be different  There are also spiders and bats, but for the most part, that's it.It is a quick game, about 4 - 6 hours, but still a fun play through (not as addictively fun as Guacamelee). There is some replay value here with collecting stuff from each level and no playthrough feels exactly the same due to the physics and AI. It was a good design choice to have collectables stay collected when you enter each level so you don't waste time getting what you already had.If you can get it cheaper than $10, go for it. If you're not into puzzles, avoid it, because the combat is pretty shallow.			",1125,324,51,104,96,15,167

												My thoughts on Trine:Trine is a beautifully designed 2D action-jumping-fighting-puzzle solving indie game. You get to play three differennt characters at once - a knight, a thief and a wizard. While obviously only controlling one of them at a time, you can switch between those three at any time, using their individual strenghts and abilities to make it to the other side of the map.As the knight, you're armed with shield and sword and are capable of lifting heavy objects and throw them at your enemies. The shield can be used to block any incoming attack, while the sword is the perfect weapon to deal with the growing numbers of skeletons, bats, and other enemies that you'll encounter.The thief is armed with a bow and thus able to fight enemies from afar (duh), and can shoot a rope on wooden objects to swing across pits, pull herself out of them in case you still manage to fall and perform cool looking jumps.As the wizard, you can summon cubes or planks to make yourself an easy way across pits, build stairs to get over high cliffs or drop them on your enemies.Each ability and spell can be upgraded throughout the game, like letting you shoot several arrows at once, create more cubes to stack on each other or make your sword even deadlier. There are hundrets of casks granting you exp or mana hidden across the game and finding (and reaching!) them all is no easy task!The graphics are among the best I've seen on a 2D game, only behind this games successor Trine 2. A special praise goes to the awesome person who created this beautiful soundtrack, the music fits this game just perfectly. I personally didn't like all of the jumping parts that much, just because I'm usually not a big fan of jumping games (and suck at it too), and died several times over. I know I'm criticising a jumping game for its jumping parts, so someone who's into that kind of stuff will have a really good and challenging time with this game. For people like myself, it's still enjoyable, and swining around with the thief is fun, but after a while it can get boring. There could be more different enemies too, since in like the first three chapters or so all you fight are skeletons and bats. Lots of good things to be said and a few bad too, still I'd recommend anyone to buy this game, especially if it's on sale for like € 1,- or so.			",182,20,4,18,15,3,20

												Nobody really knows why this game is good. It's written down on a scroll somewhere. It's a platformer in an ocean of platformers. It's sweet and pretty, it's enough and not too much, it's easy on Normal and sometimes annoying on Normal, cos who enjoys falling to their death repeatedly? But that's the genre. Get into the swing of things using Thief; mow down skeletons using a bow with up to three arrows in one shot. If she's dead for some reason, choose the knight to mow down even more skeletons. If these classes fail, use the Wizard to get to the next checkpoint. You can even fly Aladdin-style using two conjured planks on top of one another, once you turn on levitation. Leviosaaa, baby!I haven't tried co-op  and I've yet to play the game on Hard mode, but I'm 4 achievements shy of 100%, so I felt comfortable enough to share my thoughts. Finland has some great developers, so I feel good about supporting them. I rate this game ""Ihan mahtava, peukalot pystyyn!""			",207,32,4,5,7,0,3

												I think we should have more of these games nowadays. Trine simply looks stunning! It successfully captures the atmosphere of a medieval fantasy world. To make it interesting we have 3 protagonists - a knight, a rogue and a wizard - but we can only use one at a time. And no, the wizard cannot conjure up lightning and summon creatures or throw fireballs at the approaching enemies. Amadeus can only create boxes, planks or triangles - objects with which you can proceed further ahead on each level.And this is where Trine shines: There are many puzzles and you need to think and find the solution. Occasionally, you can progress fast but on your way you notice you have left some collectibles behind. So, while completing the game does not necessarily take long you are apt to spend hours with the game just to make a 100% progress on each stage.Frozenbyte did a wonderful job when releasing this gem back in 2009. Instead of picking this one you should look for the complete edition which has its sequel, the DLC for the 2nd episode and the soundtrack included. Here in Hungary the retail version of the same bundle costs around 5 EUR and you can activate all the contents via Steam.You cannot go wrong with this one and as Trine is regularly discounted you can easily find it for a suitable price. Just make sure to grab it with a friend as the sequel includes co-op mode!			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

Three's companyTrine is great fun in single-player and it's worth experimenting with the three-player co-op even if the game works best as a solo experience. Players are given a set of tools (three characters with unique abilities) and are presented with problems that can be solved in several ways, resulting in an adventure that feels wide open despite being relegated to a mere two dimensions. The beautiful visuals and sound bring this world to life and there is something new to discover around every corner. A lack of enemy variety, disappointing conclusion, and the wonky multiplayer keep Trine from greatness, but this is still a highly recommended puzzle platformer.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												Beautiful graphics, pleasant background music, decent amount of humour and comic mischief, item pickups, straightforward puzzles and arcade platformer.Achievements are reasonable and can be obtained singleplayer or co-op with 2/3 players. Published Steam community guides, online walkthrus and videos are available and all achievements can be obtained during normal playthrough of the game, after several attempts replaying a particular chapter as well as the option to replay each completed chapter on Hard difficulty.

												A beautiful blend of action, platforming, and puzzling Trine manages to offer lots of fun and even some challenge. There are also some RPG elements through level ups, skills, and hidden equipment. I will admit, the story wasn't very gripping and my friends and I would often just skip it, but the gameplay is top notch.Armed with a bow, the thief is the most agile of the three and you can use her grappling hook to traverse the environment. The knight is the traditional melee character and comes with a shield, sword, and a hammer. Probably the best character though, is the wizard. He can create boxes, planks and floating platforms, and he can also move them around. If that doesn't sound exciting, wait until your slinging boxes at all your enemies or throwing planks on your friends to make them fall into pits.When you aren't busy knocking each other off of cliffs or into fire or spikes, you will find that Trine is an extremely well made co-op game. Everyone character and player really has to work together to get through the game, and everyone fills a role. The thief's grappling hook is perfect for those hard to reach places and she is often the one retrieving experience potions, though she can hardly do it alone and the wizards platforms help immensely. The wizard is arguably the leader of the team because he is able to carry everyone on platforms, disable traps by obstructing them, and he can handles enemies fairly well with his objects. Admittedly, the knight seems to have the short end of the deal as he really only shines in combat; he can throw boxes and break walls, but there are very few cases outside of combat where he is absolutely necessary.Trine was the only local co-op game me and my friends would play for quite a while, it was just too good to put down. Now with the automatic update to Enchanted Edition, this game just got better. This game goes on sale often, and I buy it for friends whenever I can because this is a well made game and this is great developer. They worked tirelessly to completely update a 5 year old game that probably didn't rake in as much other less deserving games, and when they finished they just included it for every owner for free.You might find find a better action platformer, or a better puzzle platformer, but you probably won't find a game that blends the two together well and offers a terrific co-op experience.

												One of my favorite coop games ever but suffers from the fact that it is local coop only (something that Trine 2 ended up getting). The levels are very well designed overall allowing for a lot of solutions for the puzzles and obstacles in the game using the three hero's different abilities. The graphics are great for its time and the voice acting and music suits the game very well. Overall simply an awesome action puzzle platformer.A good selection of achievements with some really challenging stuff in there including a no-death run on the last level of the game on very hard. That took me a lot of blood, sweat and tears.Time to 100%: 13-15 hours			",942,372,36,86,96,14,164

												Trine Enchanted Edition is a brilliant 2.5D Jump'n'run game by Frostbyte. Part 1 of the series turns out very simple but still challenging.Trine - that's always nicely drawn fantastic screens. Real 3D sidescrolling jump'n'run action in a high atmospheric enviroment. 3 Players online coop gameplay. And lots of puzzles with special abilities of your 3 chooseable characters. The magician conjures metal boxes and platforms, the female thief shoots arrow and has a grapple hook, the knight uses his shield, the flaming sword and his jackhammer to burst walls. The best: you can play them altogether and switch between them during gameplay.To collect all magic vials and beat the game on hardmode you'll have some wonderful hours ...

												By this point you're perhaps already aware that Trine is a very visually stunning game, with some great artwork & lighting yet behind all of that lies a really challenging and fun platform puzzle game.The level designs are fairly basic to begin with an help introduce you to the 3 characters and their abilities without over complicating things. You have a Wizard (who can build blocks and platforms), a Thief who can swing and climb and a Warrior who can fight.You can only use one character at a time, but the game lets you switch between them easily enough so it's not hard to link abilities together. So, for example you could build a platform with the Wizard to setup an easy jump and climb with The Thief. It's that level of combination and thinking that makes Trine a fun game to play. It also helps that the designers have done a good job of scaling the difficulty at just about the right pace to keep the game challenging, but never boring or frustrating. The native 360 Controller support is a welcome feature too, and makes gameplay slightly more friendly.Further more the developers have kindly updated Trine with the engine from Trine 2, which is why it's now referred to as the 'Enchanted Edition'. The real bonus here is if you already owned Trine, it was updated free of charge. The only real negative could be the slightly wonky fighting mechanics, but that's none issue as the game isn't about the fighting or enemies. In short, Trine is a fun, well presented Platform Puzzle game that offers a good combination of problem solving, exploring and physic manipulation. Well worth a play.			",784,264,22,154,145,15,151

And trine really gets a lot lot better in coop. Ive had a blast playing  it through with 2 friends. We're planning to do a replay on a higher difficulty. ;)But nevertheless Trine (1) is still is a great game and a must play if you've liked trine2.			",231,42,7,25,25,2,35

												An astonishingly beautiful ""sidescroller"" adventure, packed with action and high quality voice acting. One of the best purchases in Steam at the moment!You play simultaneously as Pontius the Knight, Amadeus the Wizard and Zoya the Thief, who accidentally got stuck together by a magical artefact called Trine. In an attempt to rid themselves from the spell and go their separate ways, this unlikely group of Heroes find themselves growing more and more into each other.If you are even remotely familiar with the concept of RPG games, you'll know immediately that these three guys should have completely different abilities which more or less complement each other, and that is more or less true. Some points passages of the game are far easier to be completed with one class than with other, and being allowed to freely switch the characters is what makes this game so dynamic and fun.""Simple"" is the keyword for this game: the gameplay is simple, the controls are simple, the character customization is simple (only 3 skills per character, and some few equipments), the story itself is simple and cliché, but the overall environment is charming, thanks to the absurdly beautiful graphics and the really well worked voice acting.The game is fairly easy. You can die as many times as you want, you'll always wrap back to the latest checkpoint. Unless you activate the ""hardcore"" mode (which disables the infinite respawn) you will face no challenge even in Hard Difficulty.The achievements are well done but following the rest, they are also too simple. I wish there would be some extra challenge there at least, but in only 10h I've finished my first run with all achievements.My only real critique to this game is that Pontius seem to be considerably underpowered, since Zoya can easily steal his spot most of the time. His shield is rarely needed, and often one doesn't even care to switch. Fastforwarding a bit, in Trine 2 they seem to have fixed that.The Linux port is perfect also.Definitely buy this game. No question. Trine and Trine 2 are a MUST in your library!			",169,110,1,20,21,1,21

												As my girlfriend and I played through Trine this weekend for the first time, our eye balls fell out of our head ""this is the prettiest platformer I have ever seen"" we exclaimed more than once. This game is hands down the best platformer I have played since Super Mario 3 and I play a lot of them. I could not recomend this game more, it is fluid. fun, easy to learn hard to master, it has replayability it is gorgeous and smart. The one thing I have to say in retrospect is Play Trine 1 before you play Trine 2, because I started Trine 2 yesterday and it is amazing, I actually was just stunned at how good it looked, proper stunned. I am devistated at the thought of finishing it and angered that there are not more platformers like this.Am I on FrozenBytes nuts right now? Like a god damned squirel I am.

												Trine really is a gem of a game, and goes to show that you don't need a massive budget to produce a piece of art. Best played, with a friend, Trine can also be played alone, and is almost as much fun solo.Featuring beautiful graphics, tight controls and relaxing, interesting gameplay, Trine sees you (and possibly a friend) take control of three characters, which must be switched between in order to complete levels, as each has their own set of skills. The physics also play their part in the puzzles, which are reasonably easy to get through.Highly recommended if you like platformers, co-op or are just looking to try something new.

Fantasy Threesome - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Platformers are a dime a dozen. They're everywhere. The market has been saturated since the NES days, back when sides weren't meant to be scrolled. But they made that jump. And once the floodgates were open and the money was there, the industry got hit. In this day and age, it takes a lot for a platformer to stand out from the crowd. Especially when you consider that it's the genre Nintendo almost monopolizes, with the exception of smaller franchises and indies.Super Mario is a powerhouse. And all of his Nintendo cronies run the platformer business. But that doesn't mean a billion smaller upstarts can't nibble away at the glory of a AAA publisher, putting out their own innovative or gorgeously styled games. Some might even outshine Nintendo at their own game.Trine is one of those games, managing to nail smart level design and chaotic multiplayer in a way Nintendo always tries to. Originally for PC and PS3 and later remasted as Trine: Enchanted Edition for PC, PS4, and Wii U.Trine is a game about boxes. Boxes and skeletons.A knight, a wizard, and a thief walk into a tomb. You've probably heard this one. They find a treasure. A couple hundred skeletons and boxes later, they all live happily ever after.That's the whole game.A clever physics-based puzzle platformer, Trine is simply gorgeous and a pleasure to play. Utilizing an interesting three-character system, you'll have to use the powers of different characters to advance through different portions of long, puzzle-filled levels. An agile thief, a powerful knight, and a wizard. He's not really powerful or agile. But he's a ♥♥♥♥ing wizard.Their different abilities are the key to making it through the game's tricky puzzles. And what makes the game so fascinating is the amount of thought put into making each level friendly toward each character. The thief uses a grappling hook to reach far off places, while the wizard can generate platforms to help reach the. The knight can't really do either, but he's by far the sturdiest of the trio and has the easiest time dispatching enemies. It's an interesting power dynamic.When playing by yourself, Trine is a pretty good platformer. You'll be mildly challenged. You'll need to figure out the best hero for each obstacle, and the proper series of powers to use to solve each. It's pretty easy, honestly. You just figure it out, switch to that character and go. But Trine's multiplayer mode is by far where the most potential is. Because suddenly, you can't just switch to the character you need. That character is somewhere else. And maybe that character isn't doing what you're saying. Maybe they have their own ideas on how to solve things.Trine's multiplayer is complimented by the level design, encouraging not just progression by creative progression. There's multiple solutions to each puzzle, and there's usually multiple paths. It all comes down to how competent your platforming and wizarding are.Those are really the only two skills needed for the game. Though it is fun, Trine does tend to stick to the same couple puzzles over and over. Variations on a theme, or making things slightly more complicated or dangerous. But never quite pushing the limits of what it's capable of. And I suppose it's better off that way, seeing as how some of these basic physics puzzles are hard enough to solve with an incompetent party of three.At the very least, Trine is gorgeous. It's impossible to deny that. The Enchanted Edition does offer some upgraded looks, but the original is still as beautiful today as itgreat was when it first launched. Complimented by a great soundtrack, Trine does a perfect job of really building and selling its world. I'm not even particularly a fan of the generic fantasy setting, but Trine pulls it off impeccably.Out of the millions of platformers out there, this one is pretty good. It's interesting, has a nice multiplayer gimmick. Some boxes, skeletons. Skeletons are great, everyone loves skeletons.Sometimes you just need to unwind with some boxes and skeletons, you know? And this is the perfect game for those moments.			",156,15,0,29,5,0,7

												Beautiful and stunning game! The graphics are amazing and it looks even better in 3D. It takes a bit of twerking to get the 3D how you want it, but it's absoulutely astonishing! But this game isn't just eye candy! I love how you need to switch between the characters, and combine their abilities to solve all the puzzles and collect the lute! And it isn't a one way linear game! Puzzles can be solved in so many different ways that it's truly amazing. You just can't get enough of this game, and if the free trial hadn't ended I don't think I could stop playing it. Truly captivating game!			",900,753,9,105,67,4,71

												Puzzle Platformer with the added gimmick that you change your character in order to deal with the circimstances you come across. A warrior who breaks stuff, a rogue who is agile and can shoot arrows, and a mage who can create boxes and move them around with his glowy hands. As much as I dislike platformers (largely because I am TERRIBLE at them), this one is alright. If you are into these sorts of games, then this might be worth taking a look at. :o			",241,93,0,62,44,2,65

												An extraordinarily fun game with a good combination of platforming, puzzle solving, action, and RPG elements. Oh, and don't forget the pretty graphics, enjoyable music, and humorous characters. I've read that if you download the ""Enchanted Trine"" BETA, the game looks better and plays better but, seriously, the game as it is doesn't seem to need any improvements. I've been playing for hours now and I feel no need to add the Enchanted. I give this game two thumbs up and I'm looking forwards to trying out Trine 2 as soon as I finish up 1.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Basic platforming plus good physics engine. I find this game enjoyable, and I know a game doesn't have to be full of new stuff for it to be fun, but it doesn't capture my imagination. The story is pretty much traditional claptrap with very heavily stereotyped and simple characters, and the biggest challenge in later levels is trying to platform while enemies repeatedly respawn in the same place, not very creative. The physics does make for some slightly different puzzles from the usual, but it's nothing that hasn't been done before.

												Trine is a side-scrolling action platform/puzzle game developed by Frozenbyte, originally released in 2009. A remake of Trine called Trine: Enchanted Edition was released. It ports the game to the Trine 2 engine and adds online multiplayer.The gameplay consists of controlling and switches between three different characters (a wizard, a thief, and a knight) to try to complete levels filled with enemies, lots of great puzzles and many secret treasures. There is also a experience system that is shared among all characters, and is incremented by acquiring bottles found throughout levels. Every 50 experience points, each character is given one point towards the purchase of upgrades to their abilities.After so many years this is still one of the best local/online co-op experiences I've seen. Due to the enhanced edition upgrade, the game still looks good (#1, #2) and sounds amazing, just listen to the soundtrack.			",318,96,8,33,15,3,25

-Quick Review-I have already reviewed Trine2, after the enchanted update was released I don't know how much different this review will be from my first review of Trine2. (I'll refrain from the temptation of copy pasting my old review, but definitely check out my trine2 review! )Trine Enchanted Edition is a 2D fantasy adventure RPG, where you can choose between three different characters whom all have different play styles. You can get through most of the levels and puzzles simply by playing as one character, or make it easier on yourself and switch characters.


YouTube™ Video: Atratzu Reviews: Trine and Trine Enchanted - Oh, how Enchanting of him! 

			Views: 131		

			Someday's Atratzu wishes he had fancy props, new software, or the equipment to do better special effects. But he does what he can with what he has.		

 -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  I don't want to give away too much about the story, because the story is what makes this game so great. Whenever I play this game I feel like I'm listening to a bed time story being red to me by my grandfather. It has a magical attraction too it, many times it's very over-the-top just like real fairy tales, but it's that approach that just makes a game like Trine, shine (rhyme intended).You play as Zoya the thief, Amadeus the wizard, and Pontius the stout errr knight; each one has a unique game play style, but I'll explain more about that later, these three hero's are joined together by the trine, and must save the kingdom!Game Play: As has been hinted above, you play as three characters: Zoya, Amadeus, and Pontious. Firstly, Zoya (thief) is the most agile character, you shoot arrows, grapple hook and swing your way around the game. Amadeus (wizard), being a wizard can conjure up boxes that can be dropped on enemies, or used to help get to high hard-to-reach-locations. Lastly, Pontius (knight) has always been used as my ""meat shield"", he has his own unique qualities but those don't reflect my play style very well. He uses a sword and shield and a hammer; while he doesn't help for puzzle solving very much, he is very useful for bashing enemies!Seeing as how the game is 2D, it controls very simply, but I've always felt that the more simple the controls the more tight and enjoyable the game. You move right left and jump. You use the mouse buttons to shoot, attack, etc. When you start the game the game explains to you how to play it.An additional note is that thanks to the latest update the games graphics have been revamped! It now looks and feels like playing Trine2 on trine1, if you miss the old graphics or are curious about how the original trine looked like, just change the launcher to the classic trine and you can play the original game again)Another quick note about the enchanted edition: you can now play the game in multiplayer, which makes the game a whole lot more fun. I played with only one friend, but you can have 2 friends playing with you at once. Achievements: I have earned all the achievements in trine. After trying to get past hardcore mode on hard difficulty on trine2 I never thought I would get all the achievements on Trine, not for a long time anyway. after getting all the achievements aside from hardcore, I literally speed ran my way through hard mode and beat the game in one day. What that says to me, is that for those of you who want a really tough game experience, you might want pass on this game, for others who just casually play the game you're not going to get much out of it aside from a simple play through, for achievers this is a great game to increase your ""perfect games"" count +1.""What other types of achievements are there, oh derailed one?"" I'm glad you asked! Trine (and trine 2) have very straight forward achievement categories: Beat the game, Collect all the things on all the levels, do this with this character (different character challenges), and beat the game on the hardest difficulty.NOTE: there is one more note about the achievements, at the time that I'm writing this review (08/16/14) there were several bugs for achievements, I can't remember off the top of my head which ones were bugged for me, but you simply need to load the classic trine and play through that way instead of the enchanted edition. (I imagine these bugs will be fixed soon enough, but I wanted to note it)Price: Trine the Enchanted Edition is currently $14.99 I spent 13 hours playing the game, that's almost a dollar an hour, which according to my value system; is very good. I really liked that the graphics were updated, I don't grade a game based on their graphics I was enjoying the classic trine just as much as the enchanted edition, but the updated graphics really helps.  Conclusion: I rarely have very negative things to say about games that I play, I tend to enjoy games more then find them annoying. To quickly recap: I have always loved the Story in Trine. The gameplay is always smooth and enjoyable. The achievements were usually easy but enjoyable. the price was fair.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fantasy games, platformers, or 2D games.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update March 16, 2016: Added a link to my Trine YouTube Video Review!

OverviewTrine is the first iteration of the trilogy which bears the same name. It is a 2.5D action puzzle sidescroller with a focus on visual art and environmental atmosphere. The game features three characters - a wizard, a thief and a warrior - which have been magically bound together, and the player can switch between the three in an attempt to fight spawning skeletons and conjure objects to help getting to hard to reach areas of the map. The puzzles are minimal, so don't expect a brain-teaser, however the challenge to overcome obstacles and areas where good timing and reflexes are mandatory keep the game fun, especially in Co-Op mode.The Pros Beautiful Visuals - What makes this game really stand out from most side scrollers and platformers in general is the art style. The forced perspective turns this game into a 2.5D effectively, however the surrounding environments are actual 3D objects, and they are simply beautiful. Each level has its own assets, and everywhere you go you can see brightly colored backgrounds with beautiful, atmospheric lightning which at first glance will take away the focus from the gameplay just to admire it. The low resources needed to run this game also ensures a glorious 1080p60fps experience to accompany the already fancy graphics. Humorous Characters - Even though the game is not focused on its lore and backstory, the three characters have a     personality, and a funny one at that. Through the levels, you can hear them exchange some dialogue that will make you grin at least. Makes the gameplay seem much less fake. Replayability - The levels feature hidden treasure chests and XP bottles as well as a determined number of monsters you need to kill in order to fully complete it. It makes the player want to return to these levels and search for hidden areas. While at times you will struggle to find that one last missing XP bottle and get frustrated, it's still fun to go through the levels again, nonetheless. Skills and Inventory - As you progress through the story and gather XP and find hidden treasure chests, you will level up your characters and improve their abilities, as well as find items that you can distribute as you wish among the three protagonists to boost their stats. Adds a certain degree of strategy as you build your characters and makes spending some extra time in uncovering those secret areas worth-while. Co-Op Mode - You can play this game in co-op with up to two other friends, each controlling one character or anyone can play with anything. Makes the game both more fun and more easy(depending on your friends).The Cons Not Challenging Enough - the game, even on hard, is pretty easy to beat. If you are careful, even the Hardcore mode isn't too much of a challenge. Do not mistake this with the game being un-fun. It just doesn't represent a hard enough gameplay for those adventurous gamers. Unbalanced Characters - The thief, with multi-arrow shots and extreme maneuverability from the grappling hook is blatantly overpowered, and combined with the mage's ""Floating Platform"" skill makes it incredibly easy to just swing through the levels easily. The warrior is the most useless of all, except for very little occasions. Short Playthrough - Starting a new game as an experienced player and going through it again at a slow pace will take you about five hours. While a Co-Op wizard Floating-Platform + Thief Grapple style of soaring through the levels, ignoring XP and enemies could get you somewhere around two hours to complete. There are 17 levels in total, along with a boss fight that is more or less... missing. The boss level is just a ""Climb to the top of the tower before the lava reaches you"" minigame, albeit a bit hard and frustrating.ConclusionThis game is very fun while it lasts and the Co-Op revives it at times. I recommend this to platformer and action puzzle fans. Steam Achievements, Trading Cards and Cloud Saving, along with the fact that it is bundled with Trine 2 for a very cheap price at any sales are good selling points too, although the gameplay itself is enough to justify the purchase.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

												Trine is a 2d platform puzzle game.This game let me think of the Lost Viking games from the '90 era.Is a puzzle game you only can complete stages so use all 3 the characters special ability's.Graphic part of this game is so amazing for a 2d platform puzzle game.It can be a big challange to complete this game alone or together with 2 other friends.And yes the game support full 3 player co-op that makes this game very special.It's has a good and extended sotry mode that keep you alone or with friends busy for hours.I'm a big fan of the game and will give it a 8/10 score.

Was it even possible?Just when you thought Trine 2 was pretty with a fantastic atmoshpere, you buy and play Trine!I haven't gotten far into the game, but it's fun and I like the character build better in this game.With an inventory, XP with requirements.This game also feels harder than Trine 2 did, even in normal mode, I'm referring to the enemies and that the ""way points"" doesn't reset your health as they do in Trine 2. The puzzles on the other hand are(as of yet) very easy compared to Trine 2.I urge you if you've played Trine 2 to give this game a try too.If you haven't tried neither of them, buy both!------------About 6 hours later I'm fin(n)ished with the game.As I wrote earlier I do think the character build was more fun in this version.Collecting artifacts and items for your characters, you couldn't ""reset"" the skills at your pleasure.I guess the ""kids"" complained it was ""too hard qq"" or something...The game was shorter than Trine 2, but felt more fluid, the story made more sense, however, as I also mentioned, the puzzles wasn't quite as challenging as in Trine 2, the parts where you had to ""figure out"" where and how you would get to places were more annoying than challenging.

IntroTrine is a good looking game with great dialogue thoughout the game which are its best features. There are characters to choose from and a ton of collectables in the game.Good PointsThe grathics look great with bright colours and amazing visuals, Each level looks diffrent from the last so you wont get bored of the looks. Not as good as Trine 2 but still great.Controls for Thrine are simple and easy to remember, if you dont like using a keybored and mouse then you can use a controller since it has full controller support.Trine runs well, almost any computer will be able to run the game. If your still not sure then you can play the demo to make sure it runs alright.There is a bit of replay value, you can can play the game on hard mode or you can try and find all the secrets and get all of the achievements which arnt so hard. The achievements are easy to 100%.The dialogue and Narrators are great and fit in with the game perfectly. Some times they can moke you laugh and sometime they make you think.There is a co-op option which is great fun with a freind which makes the experience even better. I would recommend you play Trine  with a freind.Being able to choose from three diffrent characters is a great idea becasue you wont get bored of the gameplay since you can just swich to a diffrent character. Its very useful to solve puzzles.Bad PointsThe storyline is... Rubbish. Its a simple ""kill the bad guys to save the world from evil"" style which has been done so many times and they done nothing to spice it up. You end up not giving a damm half way though the game.I find the game to be easy, really easy. There are puzzles in every level but you end up solving them in seconds. The enemies are the same from biggining to end and since you level up, it becomes easy.The game time is short. You can complete it in about 5 hours if you dont collect or find secrets. If you want to find the secrets and take things slowly then it will take about 7 to 8 hours.OverallOverall I think Trine  is a good game which is fun to play with freinds. If you have played Trine 2 then be aware that its not as good. But its easy to move on to diffrent games. You will most likely end up forgetting about it once you have finished the game. I would recomment Trine  if you want to play it with a freind and if you like good looking games. I rate Trine 7 out of 10. ",116,9,1,8,13,0,3

												I love Trine!!! Now usually I'm not into being emo about games, but this one is great. The presentation is beautiful, a nice, colorful fantasy world with detailed graphics that   one just has to like by looking at, acompanied by a score that adds to the magic of this game. Of course there are some small glitches, caused by physics going rogue, though that doesn't happen to often to be annoying (just occasinally every now and then). Controls are straight forward, as is the gameplay. You'll be swingin, conjuring objects, smashing bones (the undead ones :P) and launching arrows in no time. OK, one has to admit that there not many enemy types, but this doesn't kill the fun. Overall, this is a must play!!!			",143,26,2,21,2,1,3

												This is a very original game. It has a platform gameplay that we all know but with things I had never seen in any game of this type.The gameplay It's primarily based on puzzles, how it works with physics is really interesting and innovative for games of this type, it is a challenging game and managed to leave me very frustrated at times (like some oldschool games could). I found very cool and unique the way you control 3 characters with different characteristics, but known to all RPG players, and using them to overcome obstacles, really innovative. The visual graphics are very well done and beautiful for a 2D game and the sound is also relaxing and enjoyable to listen when playing.Just missed a greater variety of enemies and more challenging ones. Anyway, I recommend!8/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

												The graphics are beautiful.  The mechanics of the game are great as well along with the interaction between the characters. The game follows a fairy-tale storyline but it's not the story that makes this game, it's the game-play. The puzzles are decent and rewarding and many require the use of multiple characters. The characters are well-designed and well planned. Zoya, being the mobile/agile one. Amadeus being the magician further increasing the team's mobility or blocking some paths and what not and Pontius being the warrior with the shield that can block almost anything. Great game, worth playing for sure.			",1001,407,36,150,107,15,182

												Trine is a gorgeous 2D adventure game where you control one of three heroes at any time. The graphics in this game are stunning and the gameplay is a simple platform/puzzle game where each hero has different skills and abilities. The environments are varied and done with extreme detail. The music and sound in this game really adds to the fantasy feel of this game. If you enjoy 2D side scrolling games and wants to go for a short adventure (~6 hours to complete) I highly recommend Trine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While 2D action adventure games have all but disappeared from retail, the genre is very much alive on digital distribution platforms like PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and PC. Trine is the latest of these neo-classic games and it's an impressive, modernized take on the sort of effort that dominated through the 16-bit era. It does feel a little unfinished, as though the developers ran out of money or were pressured to get the game out the door. Still, Trine is a lot of fun and definitely worth playing. Gamers have control of three unique characters: a thief, a wizard, and a knight. Each has their own abilities they can use to traverse the game's environments and dispatch of enemies. The thief wields a bow and arrow and can grapple to wooden surfaces. The wizard can move objects with his mind and summon blocks or bridges. And the knight is the fighter of the group, best used for hacking through the undead army plaguing the world. The thief and knight give players the choice to use ranged or melee combat, and both can be equally effective. A typical example of the sort of puzzles the trio will encounter would be a seemingly impassable chasm -- the thief could use her grappling hook to swing across or the wizard could summon a plank and stroll to the other side. Most predicaments can be solved in multiple ways and you could make it though most of the game with just the thief or the wizard (the knight is really only useful in combat). There are instances, though, where you'll have to use multiple characters in tandem to proceed. The wizard might be able to get a hanging block swinging from side to side. The thief can then grapple to it, and the block's momentum will allow her to jump to a previously unreachable area. Our heroes' goal is to free themselves from the curse that has bound them together and rid the land of the usual evil that has consumed it. Along the way they'll solve puzzles, kill lots of skeletons, and earn experience points that can be spent to gain new skills. A lot of the green vials that contain precious experience points are hidden, so there are many secrets to be found for players that want to put in the effort. If you're playing Trine by yourself the three characters inhabit one body and you can switch between them on the fly. They each have independent health and magic meters, and if one perishes you'll have to get by with whoever's left until you reach the next checkpoint. The game can also be played by three people cooperatively, with each controlling one of our heroes, but this completely changes the experience. When playing by yourself, you only have to worry about getting one body past an obstacle. In multiplayer, each person needs to figure out how to get their character from point A to point B, making the game more difficult and stretching every little challenge out. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but other inconveniences get in the way of making multiplayer an optimal experience. The camera will let players wander off screen, for instance, where they can be killed by who knows what and that person will have to sit around until the other players find the next checkpoint. Trine is a physics-based puzzle platformer, meaning the game's objects and characters are governed by the laws of gravity and react realistically to each other and their environment. There are lots of subtle details and nuances to be seen here. Arrows can slip through cracks in wooden planks. The thief can aim her bow in 360 degrees, as can the knight with his shield. This allows for precision aiming with the thief, and requires you to direct your blocks with the knight. Man oh man, this is one good-looking game. Set in a medieval fantasy world, developer Frozenbyte has crafted dense, extravagant scenes that scroll by as you work through the adventure. Although players can only move on a 2D plane, the world is rendered in 3D and the camera will zoom in and out for cinematic effect. The renaissance music is also very well done, with catchy tunes arranged in a lush orchestral score. A narrator and the heroes are brought to life by talented voice actors. My favorite thing about Trine is that there is something new to discover around every corner. From beautiful vistas to interesting new game mechanics, the developers always seem to have another trick up their sleeve. There are just a couple aspects that seem phoned in. It could have used a greater variety of enemies, for one. Save for a few bats and spiders, you'll spend the entire game fighting skeletons. Spawn points warp skeleton after skeleton into the world, which always feels like a rather cheap and obnoxious mechanic. There are just two boss types that are reused multiple times: a giant skeleton, and some sort of beast with a turtle shell that is a pushover. Finally, your fight with the end boss will be quite anticlimactic, and there isn't much reason to return after you've completed the story.The Verdict:Trine is great fun in single-player and it's worth experimenting with the three-player co-op even if the game works best as a solo experience. Players are given a set of tools (three characters with unique abilities) and are presented with problems that can be solved in several ways, resulting in an adventure that feels wide open despite being relegated to a mere two dimensions. The beautiful visuals and sound bring this world to life and there is something new to discover around every corner. A lack of enemy variety, disappointing conclusion, and the wonky multiplayer keep Trine from greatness, but this is still a highly recommended puzzle platformer.			",217,62,8,24,14,3,18

												It's no ain't like any other sidescrolling platformer ever.Puzzle's very well made, some puzzle require precise timing and well executed shot, and any others have multiple solution for it.I think this is frozenbyte most excellent game.Gameplay (9/10)Easy to learn yet so hard to master. most of the puzzle needs minimum of 2 heroes to help each other, no heroes left unused. If you don't play carefully and diligent enough, you'll miss most of the exp vial/bottle, and makes your hero didn't get to expand their skill as the level continue to become harder, that's the second point of puzzle game, push ourselves to the edge of fun but entrusting us to always be patient.don't forget you can always play local co-op with two of your friend with one control each hero by themselves.Sound & Narrating (8/10)you will never get bores as the old man wizard speaking, it's so calm and yet the deep voice give you chill and keep you interested at the narration (at least for me, to be sure). Thief voice actor makes you fall in love shortly, naughty voice! and that Knight, well, it always makes me laugh to hear him sayin' things.oh, amazing sound effect btw, sure to fill up your adventure.Graphics (8/10)I'm not too whiny about graphic, but if you can have game that perfect at gameplay and graphic altogether, this game welcome you. From darkness of cave and colorful landscape of fairy mountain, it's an eye candy to everyone of you.even with the lowest setting you still get pretty visual effect.Overall score (8.5/10)""Not just a game that waste your time like any other 2D(3D) sidescrolling platformer, it give you pleasant time finishing it puzzle and worth all your well spend time.""It has it flaws, no games are perfect right? Here's some list that bugging me (you can say con) :- since the first level till the end, you just fight skeleton, ♥♥♥♥ing skeleton with upgraded armor at the last level. I mean, c'mon frozenbyte, there's like many other creatures in this fantasy world you can come up to.- Thief (archer), is the most played character in this game, almost every single puzzle required her to grap and swing. And things going worsen when Wizard get the last skill, creating triangle that can be hooked by Thief grappling hook. and at that time it become Thief-centered-puzzle-solving.- Level 3 fire arrow + Amulet 25% damage (for skill that use energy) is total ♥♥♥♥♥. 4 full stretched shot to big boss, 1 to full armored skeleton, sure a funstopper.- The ending was good, but to be honest, I thought I'll be fight a massive big flying skeleton, but em-em nope at all.TL;DRsummarize my review, it's a great platformer game, fill up your 15hours gameplay.

												Trine is the simple fairy tale of a knight, a thief, and a wizard that are bound together by a shared, but selfish, purpose that spirals in a classic battle against evil to save the world. Just like most fairy tales, it's light on character motivation and heavy on heroic deeds. And that focus serves it. Whether it's crouching behind a shield to advance through a jet of fire, flinging a grappling hook into a support beam above to swing across a pit, or levitating a huge stone fist to drop on an offending skeleton, it's all so satisfying and it flows so well. Every puzzle is integrated seamlessly as an obstacle blocking the way to the next part of the three's quest, an obstacle that can be dealt with in any variety of ways. The thief might be able to easily swing to the next platform, but the wizard might just as easily be able to pull that platform into his jumping range and the knight might be able to break through the debris that made the jump difficult in the first place. It's this interchangeability of usefulness but specialization of means that makes the consequences of failure so enjoyable. If a character dies that character can be brought back at the next checkpoint, but until then a set of tools has dropped off your belt and you're forced to overcome any obstacles on the way without them. It's never impossible to proceed, but in the absence of a preferred strategy, you're forced change your approach, forcing you to look at those puzzles and characters left in a different light. Sure, with flawless execution you can blaze through the entire game on a single set of tactics. It's only when you don't stick that landing or dodge that attack that this short, simple game really gets to show how well it's designed. And that's when you want a game to shine. Things can be beautiful and interesting when you're frolicking along, but when you're repeatedly falling on your face, that's when you appreciate clever, polished design.			",46,31,0,7,6,0,7

												Trine is a puzzle platformer indie game, similar to the Lost Vikings. You're going to progress through levels by solving puzzles, jumping from platform to platform and defeating the enemies standing in your way. There are 3 different characters, and you will have to switch between them, utilizing their different abilities and strengths to make it to the end. The nice art, beatiful soundtrack, funny narration and voice acting just add up to a very fun gameplay, making this game really enjoyable to play.If you enjoyed playing the Lost Vikings 20 years ago, or like fun puzzle/platformer games, this is a must!

												What can I say about Trine? It's pretty good. This is how character switching should be done (I'm looking at you CreaVures!). In Trine you play as three separate characters who are magically bound together, due to the three touching some hokey magical item that apparently does this, and only one of the characters can be active at once in some sort of multiple personality disorder situation where your other personalities can bring weapons along with them. Makes sense? No? Well it doesn't have to because the gameplay is good. Trine doesn't make you go back and walk your other characters through the same level after one has cleared it already because all characters occupy the same space. Good old platforming with skill switching to accomplish certain tasks. That is what Trine offers and it does not fail to disappoint.			",507,127,7,26,23,2,37

												Gameplay: 9/10Storyline: 10/10Graphics: 9/10SoundTrack: 9/10Overall: 9.25/10""I’ve said this before but I must reiterate: although I figured some downloadable games would eventually become good options for casual gamers, they would never be anything I’d purchase. But it didn’t take long for me to eat my words, as the likes of Wipeout HD, echochrome, Shatter, Flower, and even Magic Ball have all surprised me with their wonderful polish, extremely high fun factor and equally high level of playability and accessibility. Now, when I see a game like Trine pop up, I do question the $20 price tag and ask myself, “is it worth it?” Then, I remember the many great games I’ve downloaded off the PSN and immediately become encouraged; I went into this new title with that same optimism and once again, I wasn’t disappointed. For those of you who never played Trine on PC, I’m here to tell you it made the transition very well and without much of a stumble; it’s a beautifully designed side-scrolling action/adventure that will test your wits and your reflexes.Visually, this is one of the best-looking downloadable games you will ever see. In fact, artistically-speaking, it may be the best, although one could make solid arguments for Wipeout HD and Flower. This beautiful 2D world is alive with vibrant colors, gorgeous lines and environment depictions, and a very impressive level design. Each of the three characters look great as well; they’re nicely detailed and enjoy fluid animations, so Trine is definitely a joy to behold. The only drawback centers on the enemies, which are little more than generic skeletons and a few bats here and there. They don’t appear to be anywhere near as polished and accomplished and in all honesty, I never liked to see the skeletons show up because they’d instantly mar an otherwise pretty graphical presentation. Even the brief cut-scenes that only include still-frame photos look like paintings and blend nicely with the gameplay visuals. Really, I have every confidence you’ll smile when you see Trine.The sound is good, too, but I once again have to complain about the lack of a stellar soundtrack. The music fits the atmosphere, certainly, but it’s just not brought out enough during our adventure and it’s also far too repetitive, although you probably won’t notice. I say you won’t notice because the gameplay is guaranteed to keep your attention, but we’ll get to that in a moment. The effects are clear and accurate, although there’s a slight balance issue as the Thief’s grappling hook always seems louder and crisper than just about anything the Wizard can do with his magic. These minor complaints aside, the narrator is fantastic and adds to the fantastical, fairytale flavor, the voices for each character are good (although not heard often), and overall, there’s nothing to get into a twist about. Trine sounds almost as good as it looks, and that’s all you really need to know.At first, if you’re not familiar with the game, you won’t be too enthusiastic by what you first see when you start. You lead three separate characters in the same general direction and while you might correctly surmise that each section is a mini-tutorial of sorts, you might not realize that all three characters will be used at once when the trio comes together. This is the crux of the gameplay: there’s a Knight, Thief, and Wizard, and each character has his or her own special skills and abilities. The Knight has a sword and can easily deal with most enemies, and he can also cut ropes and pick up small objects. The Thief has a grappling hook (uber-helpful throughout) and a bow, which she can aim on the fly in a full 360 radius. The Wizard can use his magic to move objects around and he can even draw boxes in thin air and transform them into solid objects, which is another very useful skill. On the flip side, all three have the exact same platforming/jumping ability; they can all leap the same height and distance.Well, at least I think they can. I keep thinking the Thief is slightly more agile but I could be wrong. Anyway, each level, which is set up with an old-school, 2D side-scrolling format and you must find a way past the variety of obstacles, puzzles, and foes that lie in your path. The Thief can easily swing across a gap, provided there’s a piece of wood above that can act as an anchor for her grappling hook, or the Wizard can move a box for the Knight to leap atop of and clamber up to the other side. There are any number of ways you can tackle a certain problem, and switching between the characters is as easy as pressing the R1 button. Each character has his or her own health and magic bar so if you get nailed as the Knight, you might want to rely more on the bow of the Thief. The gameplay mechanics are excellent and because you aim the Knight’s shield exactly as you would the Thief’s bow (with the right analog), you can block in any direction. This adds some substance and depth to the battles.Of course, it’s not really about the combat. You will really only face two large boss-type enemies in the entire game, and neither prove to be much of a challenge for the worthy Knight. This is a bit of a downside, though, as are the spawning skeletons that can prove annoying and tiresome in certain areas. Furthermore, and speaking of those two bosses, I noticed some definite collision detection issues with the giant skeleton; whether or not his big sword actually hit me seemed random (even if I had my shield up).(...) If, on the other hand, you want a great adventure experience that makes you think and rewards you for your ingenuity and dedication, you’ve come to the right place. The levels are so ingeniously designed, you almost never do the same thing twice; the developers definitely take advantage of the three distinct skill sets available to the player. Best of all, it just never seems to get old…the progression is surprisingly addictive.Your goal will be to nab as many green experience potions as possible. The good news is that it doesn’t matter which of the three characters picks up an experience potion (unlike the health and magic potions; obviously, you’ll want to nab those with the characters that need them). The experience is distributed equally, which means everyone will basically level up at the same time. You will earn new abilities as you go – and enhance them with acquired points – and if you can nab some treasure chests, you’ll be able to equip some nifty accessories, too. In this way, combined with the relevant stats, there are role-playing elements sprinkled in with the side-scrolling adventure/platforming format, and it all gels together very, very well. Oh, and if you lose a character, he or she will automatically come back at the next checkpoint.Oddly enough, even though three players can team up and go through the adventure cooperatively, it’s actually more rewarding as a single-player experience. This is because that with three players, each one has to work past an obstacle without the help of any other character; so even though the Wizard can’t just swing around like the Thief, he still has to find his way across. This slows things down and makes the game a bit more tedious. Furthermore, I think it takes away from the hidden genius of the game: being able to switch between each of the three characters on the fly and have access to each skill set when attacking obstacles and puzzles is great. It's what makes this game so much fun to play; the options you have and the way your brain works when it considers all three. It’s too bad that the co-op isn’t quite as good but hey, at least the multiplayer option is there if you want to give it a go. But really, you gotta play it through by yourself, even if it’s not very long.(...)""Ben Dutka - psxextreme.com ",228,30,10,16,18,3,28

												Bought this game on discount and worth every single piece of it even though you buy on normal price. You will play an adventure to complete each stage with some puzzle using 3 kind of heroes with their personal skills, so you need to maximize each character skills to continue your adventure. As you adventuring through each chapter, you will collect exp and item. You can also leveling your heroes skills. Overall, It has nice graphics and music. VERY RECOMMEDED!!!!

												Thanks for providing such a great game, as well as remaking it into Trine 2 Engine.Trine is a very impressive game to me. I saw it on a programme in a gaming TV channel at first. At that time, I was surprising that what a good idea to self co-op with 3 characters. Its story is good as well. It describes a great background with some cool and stylish paintings, music and most important: the great voice-over in British-style English. :D very good			",56,8,0,1,5,0,2

												I have played Trine when it first came out, many years ago, and i was pleasantly surprised by this little gem. Now, after completing Trine 2 this summer, i have decided to play first one in Steam. And, boy, it looks old. Well, looks are still pretty, especially some places like the Iron Forge. But the physics are bad, comparing to the new one. I know it is not fair. But it was harder to control objects and control heroes in this one. Experience collecting achievements are easier in this one, but still there are some hidden in lava or acid or other invisible places bottles, which made me mad sometimes. And skeletons. I wish there were fewer of them. They usually do not pose any threat and you just have to stand and shoot them, one by one, one by one, hordes of skeletons on every level section. You can skip them, if you don't want to collect enemies experience and if you don't want to level up or get the achievements. Yes, so you have to stand and shoot (or smash with the knight). This just creates boredom in this unique game of physics puzzles. So it could be less dumb enemies and more puzzles, or maybe a few smarter enemies. But i'm still recommending this now a classic game of its genre.			",103,29,6,15,14,0,61

												This franchise is my favorite side scroller franchise I have yet played. Now, let it be know that I am not an established or seasoned gamer. However, I am a huge fantasy lover and so for me this game is a win on a level that transends simply gameplay. Now to start, the gameplay is excellent. Each of the three characters are perfect manifestations of the stereotypical types of classic fantasy. This game is an excellent romp of fantasy. The archery, magic, swinging, melee, and just about every other feature of the three characters is well thought out and impressively executed. The narrative is perfectly balanced between not actually being too imporant that it takes itself too seriously, but also adding an excellent layer of culture to the game world. The soundtrack as well is quite exceptional and really adds to the atmosphere.Though at the end of the day it just comes to the fact the gameplay is just undeniably solid.End.			",85,15,1,4,7,0,14

If you have doubts, check out the demo for it.Looking forward to the sequel which will feature... wait for it.....  ONLINE CO-OP!

												Trine is a 2D action puzzle platformer. You take control of 3 different characters all with different abilities on your way to take down your enemies, avoid hazardous traps and collect treasures. The visuals are beautiful with vivid colours and the animations are satisfying. There is nothing special about it's story, but it is enough to keep you going with a nice sense of storytelling. The soundtrack on the other hand is gorgeous with various orchestral tracks arranged by Ari Pulkkinen and it really fits the game. With it's visuals, soundtrack and gameplay combined, Trine offers around 9 hours of pure fun and even more for the completionists. It's a must buy for every action puzzle platformer lover over there!			",157,55,0,40,22,1,38

												Trine is an absolutely incredible game. In this review, I will list the many things I loved about it and the few things I disliked. Pros:1) The graphics are absolutely gorgeous. They're extremely colorful  and detailed.2) The abilities of the characters are well thought out, and you are rewarded for looking for chests.3) The mechanics of the three characters work very well together. Near the end of the game, I was finding myself subconsciously switching from one character to another.Cons:1) The characters would occasionally glitch out, especially while using the Theif's grapple.2) Enemies were not developed well. Much of the time, a skeleton trying to attack me would begin running and swinging at a wall. Took away from the immersion and flow of gameplay.3) Bosses were not made well. [SPOILER ALERT] I had to face the same two bosses twice. I defeated the first one, then the second one, then I had to face the first one again, and the second one again. These were the only bosses (excluding the final boss). Also, as I was fighting with them, they glitched out. The second/fourth boss froze during battle and let me kill him.4) The story of the game was short and undeveloped. I'm still rather confused about the plot of the game. If most games create a story and base the game off the story, it seems like Trine made the game and then wrote the story afterwards. I would've liked more character development/attatchment. As well, the story itself didn't last long. I beat the game in 6.9 hours, which included me gathering nearly every experience bottle and chest in every map.5) The end of the game was not satisfying whatsoever. [SPOILER ALERT] The final boss isn't a fight. You must climb through a level rapidly, fighting skeletons and destroying objects dropped on you with the boss. In the end, you climb onto a platform with the 3 artifacts, and you win. Then, during a cutscene, the ""boss"" tries to attack the theif, and gets crushed in one hit by the Knight's hammer. This wasn't satisfying at all, the battle was intense enough but the end left me feeling cheated out of something, like I still needed to finish the battle.All-in-all, this game would be absolutely astounding if the developers were more thorough. Whether this was due to a low budget, time limitations, or lazy development, the game felt incomplete. I recommend buying this game and playing it if you're looking for some fun. I hope the next two games will be better developed, and if you plan on playing those, I highly suggest playing this first to get even a vague idea of what the story is about.			",28,1,0,0,2,0,0

												In a world of games filled with Actions, Colors, and generally noise. Specially in a world itself filled with noise and busyness outside of video games. I think Trine fits beautifuly to fill an abandoned and necessarily needed gap.It is a simple game, so simple in fact I can even recommend it to the young ones. The puzzles are simple but not lame, the artistic style is incredible, voice acting though scarcley there is well done, sound effects are top notch. It's really hard to believe the effort put into this game despite it's nature. The attention to details is in every corner. Every technical aspect is top notch.I didn't play CO-OP so I can't speak about that though.The main thing is, I found it really fun to just play a simple game that let's you relax. Still, not simple enough that it's poorly excuted. This is a game every gamer should play to relax from his/her typical competitive online or dynamic rich single player game. Already have the 2nd installment in my library, and WILL get the 3rd one too.			",22,1,1,2,1,1,2

												Trine is a fun physics-based puzzle/platformer featuring 3 main characters, each with unique abilities: the Knight is your typical close combat brawler; the Thief fights at long range with a bow and can utilize a grappling hook; and the Wizard can create and manipulate different types of objects. The characters (which can be swapped at will) each have their own unique way of tackling the levels, which makes for lots of variety in how the game can be played. Gameplay takes place on a 2D plane, but the environments are all rendered (gorgeously, I might add) in full 3D. The story is fairly generic, but the voice acting is decent. Combat is done well and is pretty fun, but unfortunately gets old pretty quickly - you'll be fighting the same few enemies over and over again throughout the whole game. The issue isn't a deal-breaker by any means.. it's just a tad disappointing. All in all, Trine is a really well done game which I fully recommend for 2D platforming fans.			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

												I'm sure this is going to get downvoted by diehard fanboys of this series, but really. The graphics are nice, yes. The music's decent. There's a good premise for a game here. So why is it /so bloody boring/? There's very little variation in the levels here, aside from one or two notable exceptions most every level plays the same. Even then the only notable departure is the last level, which is instead just flat-out flawed. The game focuses far too much on its combat system and too little on platforming or creative puzzle design. There's about three different types of enemies throughout the entire game, and they're all over the place in each level. So fighting them gets... really boring, really fast. Though the bats never stop being annoying. Ever. The puzzle design is mostly physics-based and can also be entirely broken, basically defeating the point. I have plenty of fun playing as the thief and doing neat platformery stuff, but that's fairly limited throughout the game... I kind of wish the game was based more around that mechanic than the combat or physics puzzles, really. But as it stands the game just felt like it dragged on forever to me despite not even having that massive of a play time to it overall. Not going to say it's outright terrible but it's not particularly impressive either.			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

												Released in 2009, Trine made quite the impact among the players, and then again in 2014 when Frozenbyte released the Enchanted Edition, a remake of the original using a new engine.The peaceful kingdom is at jeopardy, the king is dead, and an army of evil and somehow cute skeletons and other creatures rise from the depths. All hope seems lost until our heroes arrive. A mysterious thief named Zoya, Amadeus the wizard, and our chubby knight Pontius. All brought together by the distant memories of the Trine, perhaps the only chance to save the kingdom, and all its people. Trine is a side-scrolling game full of action and puzzles waiting to be solved. Thanks to each characters special ability, going through each level will require imagination. But don’t worry, planning something actually works with Trine, and maybe that’s what players really admire the most. Creating your way throw-out the 16 levels won’t be much different every time you play, but the beautiful graphics will help. If we all have to agree on something, is that Trine looks astonishing,  with bright or dark colours, it’s all out there, to make you enjoy each level as a whole, and creating an atmosphere for the player. It’s a magical world, filled with exotic places, from dungeons to mythical forests, trough castles of bright and dangerous lights, to hidden villages with unspoken dangers, there’s fun for all the family. The gameplay is quite intuitive, even for youngsters, which makes Trine the perfect family game. But don’t worry, the developers were nice enough to place some really hidden objects that will make you think and replace your steps with each of our three warriors. Levitate or create objects, fight your way out with the sword, hook any wood surface and swing with style, there are plenty to go around when comes to play styles. The player can only use one character at the time, but change it at any point in the game. Make use of their skills, and improve them using a simple and minimalist (but good) menu, together with a nice inventory where you can place the items you want a certain hero to use. There are several game modes, from the standard easy, to hardcore where your skills are tested, and maybe even your patience! Now that we mentioned testing, why not test the original Trine? It’s included in this Enchanted Edition!Trine is a unique experience, doesn’t matter how many games you’ve played, Trine is unique, unique to its magical bright colours, fun gameplay, and even a nice narrative that will keep you focused on the story-line.A solid 9, and a must to your collection!

Fairytale graphics in a telling storyThis is quite a good game, still very playable in 2014 considering its age (it was first released in 2009). It's not a classic sidescroller-platformer, more like an 2.5D platform game with moderately difficult puzzels incorporating jumping and some nice, quite modern feeling physics.You play as one of three members of a party (a Wizard, a Knight and a Thief), and the nice touch is that you can switch between these three at any given time. This is often necessary to solve a puzzle or to make further progresss in the game, which means that once a party member is killed, chances are there you have to go back to the last savepoint. Thankfully, these are plenty enough to keep things agreeable - mind you, not quick save in this one. A bit surprisingly, difficulty seems to diminish once the game gets going - after level 5 or so (from the 15). Since by then you have far more abilities and more powelfull weapons, it gets easier to bruise through the levels. That's not a real problem, since each new level presents an different set of colours and atmosphere, but it is somehow surprising.The department where Trine really shines, is its visuals. Not that there are really fancifull effects, it's just that the atmosphere of the different levels is captured to perfection. There is something fairytale-like about Trine, which is really enthralling and keeps one playing for a while.And since the Enchanted Edition was relased, visuals have even been improved by more than a notch. Alas, the story really is not so entertaining, so after a bunch of levels you could lose intesest. Physics are great and enhanch the puzzels to a considerable effect, since you often have to resort to them.Still: recommended for those who love a game with real atmosphere and good albeit rather simple game mechanics.Gameplay: 22/30Graphics: 15/20Sound: 7/10 (nothing spectacular here, but the music really is fine)Stability/patching: 18/20Long-lasting appeal/replayability: 12/20 (there is local co-op)Overall: 74/100			",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

												""Man's greatness lies in the power of thought.""Trine represents a very good 2-D jump & run adventure game with interesting puzzles and three unique characters, each of them with their individual skills and specialties. You can switch on the fly between them to solve the various puzzle sections in a way you see fit. This multitude of different ways to proceed through Trine is also its greatest strength.Next to the vibrant environment and great love for detail, the well-done physical effects are also noteworthy. The controls are good and simple, and the A.I. is competent enough to keep you on the edge.  Furthermore the multiplayer adds some extra life to the game, as the experience is genuinely different. Fun fact: Trine was originally started as a side-project by a senior programmer of Frozenbyte, while the rest of the team was working on another project. The other project ran into publisher and funding problems however, and the team decided to focus their efforts instead on developing Trine. --My rating system consists of five categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere -	Details-	Puzzles-	Story-	Combat & ControlsBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: A-RankDetails: S-Rank(When we are no longer able to change the situation – we are challenged to change ourselves.)Puzzles: S-Rank(You are always a student, never a master.

												When I decied to play this before the 2nd game I wasn't sure if this would be worth it, But I found out quickly that I was very wrong, The first game is just as stunning and amazing as the 2nd one, The setting is beautiful and levels interesting, Puzzles are simple most of the time but getting exp pots and finding chests is the real difficulty in this game. It makes you want to explore every inch of the level to make sure you didn't miss a single thing and I love that. This game has to be one of my favorite games I've played and I can't wait to finish it and continue playing Trine 2. :)			",63,10,0,14,5,0,5

												I did not expect being disappointed by a game with 'overwhelmingly positive' reviews.Am I the only one who noticed that there are only 4 types of enemies in the entire game? That the 1st and 2nd bosses are used several times throughout the game? That the game has no endboss despite being an action platformer? The ending is a complete joke. In addition, the tag 'puzzle' doesn't suit this game because the puzzles are either too easy or can be completely avoided in Singleplayer thanks to the thief's abilities. This game is boring because there is an obvious lack of variety. The classes are also really unbalanced. As a consequence some are more fun (Thief) than others (Knight). The knight's gameplay is based on smashing the same button to kill ennemies. Amazing. Later on you get upgrades which allow you to insta-kill ennemies, but beware: you will need 2 buttons! Playing with the Thief or Wizard makes the fights at least a bit more entertaining.I won't deny that the graphics are great, that the music is nice, that the story is better than for typical platformers, but none of these elements can make up for the lack of gameplay variety.

												A very polished game, visually and gameplay-wise.  Fun on many levels.  I gotta give this game a shout out because if you want to just have some nice casual co-op fun this is the game to play.  Each of the three characters has their own strenghts and weakensses, coupled with their ompletely different abilities.  I'd say that alone makes this game replayable because playing different characters forces you to approach each puzzle differently.  On top of that, most puzzles require teamwork so be prepared to discipline your mates.  All in all its a fun challenge, just make sure to grab some friends and beer!Oh and the same goes for Trine 2.  Both are amazing.			",100,10,0,13,10,0,11

												Trine was released in an era when the side-scroller was a lacking appearance on PC. It sports gorgeous backgrounds, funny puzzles (which can be solved, avoided and even completely exploited thanks to the 3 heroes' abilities) and at points witty dialogues, successfuly breaking the rhythm of slaying countless waves of monsters.The developer, Frozenbyte offers amazing support - Linux works, OS X works, full keyboard + mouse, XInput gamepad (Xbox controller), multiplayer and couch multiplayer (just plug in the controllers, with up to 2 buddies on the couch and hack and slash your way through the campaign). The game also supports stereoscopic 3D - and it's among the few games natively doing it, a true show-off, with its vivid colors and spectacular backgrounds on 3D TVs.A must have for Big Picture Mode, together with its sequel - Trine 2. Highly recommended!			",66,9,0,5,3,0,6

												trine is a puzzle platform game with a sweet fantasy setting and very quality graphics. puzzles are always obstacle-removing type. you need to remove obstacles or make your own way in order to advance in the level, using your three characters (thief, warrior, mage) and their unique abilities. puzzles are generally based on phyics and not very hard to solve. trine is an enjoyable game. if you like platform games, puzzle games or fantasy theme (without dark atmosphere for once), game is recomended.8/10			",182,48,1,29,8,0,15

												Equal parts beautifully awesome and awesomely beautiful.One of my favorite things about this game is that unlike other puzzle-platformer type games, Trine's design philosophy seems to be more along the lines of ""give the player a selection of awesome tools with which to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles and then let them figure it out in what ever way they want"" as opposed to the more common puzzle-platformer design philosophy of ""let's see how needlessly complex we can make each successive puzzle and then playtest the heck out of it until we're sure there's only one needlessly complex way to solve each puzzle."" The replay value of this game is much better than games like Portal simply because you can play through it again and again with the mindset of ""let's see if I can solve this in some other way..."" I think this sums it up nicely: Play time in Trine: 109 hours. Play time in Portal: 18 hours.Oh, and did I mention they went back and added online co-op to this? Loads of fun with a friend or two.

												Trine is an utterly brilliant side-scrolling platformer that has a healthy mix of problem-solving and fantasy action/adventure. The game is developed by a Finnish indie company called Frozenbyte, Inc. whose name should now be set in stone to the video game hall-of-fame. Trine essentially remasters a classic genre and provides a worthwhile investment for casual gamers. It features a beautifully detailed world, first-rate voice acting and a light plot that keeps you joyfully entertained. Every gamer should praise Trine as a unique edition to their catalog.

												When I first saw this game, which was on sale, I got stucked in front of my desktop screen: it was somehow... attractive.I saw its videos and I instantly loved it. -85%, it was very worth. Then, shall we start:Though I have never played RPG-platforms games like this one I've to say that it's awesome.  The art ist beautiful, the landscapes of the different levels are enjoyable. It's a perfect environment for the game. I've played the italian version so I don't know how are the english voices but the italian ones were pretty good so I guess the english' are as well. It was really the same as being told a story by a storyteller. And the music. OMG. It was so eargasmic. Such a pity it doesn't come along with the Enchaned Edition. Fortunately in Trine 2 it does and it's quite similar from what I listened.The game is a puzzle-kind that offers exploration to fulfill completely the levels. I'm a perfectionist, so I tried to collect every collectable that existed. In many levels I couldn't, so I'll try them again until I get all the potions and secrets. Some are hard to get and others to find.Then, I've to say that is rather short, in 7 hours I finished it (the 0.8 h it's due to my play in co-op) and well, the story isn't very immersive but still is beautiful. It's a cliched one and it has no cutscenes. And the ""final"" battle it was somehow dissapointing completing the level was harder than defeating the boss. In fact, the boss isn't beaten directly, in order to beat it we must go up and complet the level, which is kinda difficult, but still, a final boss-battle could have been really amazing.I should say that there were no bugs except a few ""bosses"" that got stucked, paralyzed. I don't know if it was due to the co-op, since I completed 80% of the game on online co-op with my brother, but still, they had a bug that made them got stucked sometimes. The AI is also interessant, they are able to jump as you are so they can get where you are in a few seconds! And in some levels there were many of them and combined with the level difficulty makes the game so freacking attractive. With some treasures, which I reccomend to search, find and get, the abilities of the three characters improve so much.I also reccomend to play it in co-op when someone with whom you can talk, sometimes was really funny when we both died in the same stupid way xD Ah, the levels that you complet on co-op are also completed in the Single Player, so be aware of it.That's all. Ah, another thing. There are two versions of the game, the Enhanced one and the Original. I played all the game with the Enhanced one, which has the same graphic engine as Trine 2. I opened the Original one a few minuts ago and I've to say I prefer the Enhanced, whose graphics are more... soft.Thanks for reading.			",39,16,0,11,8,0,2

												This game might not be the first with the concept of you controlling three characters with different abilities at once, but it succeeds greatly by using this feature. Most of the game (if not all) could be done with either of those characters but that would be a real challenge (and could've worked well for an achievement).It took me less than 11 hours to complete the game with all achievements on hardest difficulty (not hardcore mode, because that didn't sound like much fun), so it falls a bit short on actual playtime. Nonetheless, I had a lot of fun these hours! The visuals are amazingly beautiful and the dialogs between the characters are quite fun. There are also some small annoyances. Some menus (including the start screen if you don't know how the game works) rely on using the mouse instead of a controller. Some menus only sometimes work with the controller, which was really confusing. The gameplay feels sometimes a bit clunky, especially when you try to not fight extremely save with the warrior.Still, it's a great game and I really anticipate playing the sequels.

												Trine is a game everyone should play or try out; from the beautiful AAA worthy art style to great game mechanics, excellent voiceover and engaging storyline, this is the ultimate platformer game experience.Complementing the already great single player experience is the co-op multiplayer both local and with Trine Enchanted now online as well.Frozenbyte has really done an exceptional job with this game and have one of the best PC support teams around; be it with troubleshooting small bugs to giving existing owners the Enchanted update for free.This is one game you should not skip.Looking forward to playing Trine 2 and future Frozenbyte games.

												A very polished game, visually and gameplay-wise.  Fun on many levels.  I gotta give this game a shout out because if you want to just have some nice casual co-op fun this is the game to play.  Each of the three characters has their own strenghts and weakensses, coupled with their ompletely different abilities.  I'd say that alone makes this game replayable because playing different characters forces you to approach each puzzle differently.  On top of that, most puzzles require teamwork so be prepared to discipline your mates.  All in all its a fun challenge, just make sure to grab some friends and beer!Oh and the same goes for Trine 2.  Both are amazing.			",100,10,0,13,10,0,11

												Trine was released in an era when the side-scroller was a lacking appearance on PC. It sports gorgeous backgrounds, funny puzzles (which can be solved, avoided and even completely exploited thanks to the 3 heroes' abilities) and at points witty dialogues, successfuly breaking the rhythm of slaying countless waves of monsters.The developer, Frozenbyte offers amazing support - Linux works, OS X works, full keyboard + mouse, XInput gamepad (Xbox controller), multiplayer and couch multiplayer (just plug in the controllers, with up to 2 buddies on the couch and hack and slash your way through the campaign). The game also supports stereoscopic 3D - and it's among the few games natively doing it, a true show-off, with its vivid colors and spectacular backgrounds on 3D TVs.A must have for Big Picture Mode, together with its sequel - Trine 2. Highly recommended!			",66,9,0,5,3,0,6

												trine is a puzzle platform game with a sweet fantasy setting and very quality graphics. puzzles are always obstacle-removing type. you need to remove obstacles or make your own way in order to advance in the level, using your three characters (thief, warrior, mage) and their unique abilities. puzzles are generally based on phyics and not very hard to solve. trine is an enjoyable game. if you like platform games, puzzle games or fantasy theme (without dark atmosphere for once), game is recomended.8/10			",182,48,1,29,8,0,15

												Equal parts beautifully awesome and awesomely beautiful.One of my favorite things about this game is that unlike other puzzle-platformer type games, Trine's design philosophy seems to be more along the lines of ""give the player a selection of awesome tools with which to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles and then let them figure it out in what ever way they want"" as opposed to the more common puzzle-platformer design philosophy of ""let's see how needlessly complex we can make each successive puzzle and then playtest the heck out of it until we're sure there's only one needlessly complex way to solve each puzzle."" The replay value of this game is much better than games like Portal simply because you can play through it again and again with the mindset of ""let's see if I can solve this in some other way..."" I think this sums it up nicely: Play time in Trine: 109 hours. Play time in Portal: 18 hours.Oh, and did I mention they went back and added online co-op to this? Loads of fun with a friend or two.

 Overview ""Trine is a side-scrolling action platform and puzzle video game"" - is what wiki says. Trine is a throwback to the best old 2D games, we used to have.First of all, I really like this game. It's the perfect combination of graphic and music to make you have a great week night playing an Indie game and enjoying it, solving puzzles and just laugh at how useless the Knight is. Second of all, as I said the music is great, even though it's repetitive, the alternance between the 'enemies are here' soundtrack and the 'I am just counjouring a box' soundtrack, makes it feel really comfortable.In the single player, you have to choose between 3 characters, that are all fused into one body through magic.Steam Achivements and level: There is a total of 33 achivements. Five achivements are for completion: Find all the secrets in every level, Complete the whole game, Complete Astral Academy - the tutorial, Colect all the experience in the game, Earn all the achivements in the game.There are the collecting achivements - where you have to colect all the experience points in all the levels including Astral Academy - the tutorial. And there are the special achivements, such as: complete a level with 25 character deaths, or kill five monsters with a singly physical object, stay underwater for almost 20 seconds and so on.The achivements aren't very hard, especially when you can play co-op, where if one of your team mates does the achivements, it automatically applies to you as well. The hardest one I thinks I earned was to finish the last level with no deaths and to play the entire game on hard difficulty. This achivement it not that hard, you just have to do a speed run through-out the whole levels, but the enemies are so annoying because there are so many, and you have to spend extra hours to complete it.All in all the achivements are 'makeable' and you can do them in less that 20 hours.My favorite achivement is the Winter Secrets - you have to find the Academic, Bony and Crystalline holiday secret gifts.The levels are chapters of a continuous story that gradually unfolds as each level is completed. The levels become increasingly more challenging as the game progresses.There are 14 levels, 15 if you include the Astral Academy.In Trine there are many hazards that are encountered and have to be overcome:Lava - blazing hot liquid lava.Toxic Water - the lethal poisonous water in some streams and lakes.Water - the underwater areas in some streams and lakes(here you can die if you dont have a charm for undefinite water breathing)Traps are dangerous and can inflict serious damage or even death if not negotiated with care:Enemies are often lurking near traps and should be looked out for.The Three Heroes : There is the mage/wizard : The Wizard has certain Abilities that will be useful to the Three Heroes, such as:- conjure certain magical objects into existence with his Conjuration ability;-  to magically move many things with his Levitation ability;In the beginning, you are given the power to conjour a box, into the word, but as the levels go further, so does this ability. The sizes can vary depending on what you counjour. The first upgrade for the mage is that now two boxes can exist in the world at the same time and the second upgrade is that four boxes can exist.As the game goes on, you find different perks and abilities for the characters, and the mage can now conjour planks.The first upgrade for the mage is that now two planks can exist in the world at the same time and the second upgrade is that four planks can exist. While trying to learn the elusive fireball spell, the Wizard has discovered the ability to conjure a triangle-shaped floating platform. This platform can carry weight, providing a stepping stone. The first upgrade is that the thief can attach her grappling hook to the floating platform, and the second upgrade is that the floating platform can be set on fire and will explode.The game has different objects and items, that can either improve health/mana or add extra upgrades to the wizard - such as extra planks or boxes.There is the thief : The Thief has certain Abilities that will be useful to the Three Heroes.The Thief is equiped with a grapple hook rope which she is able to use in many ingenious ways.You are an expert archer, able to kill from a distance, thus the bow ability. First upgrade is that the bow can shoot two arrows at once and the second ability is that now you can shoow three arrows at once.Next is the fire bow ability, where you can break objects and light them, such as torches - this ability really comes in handy when the level is pitch black and there's a pit just near the corner. For this one, the first upgrade is the fire damage that increases and the second upgrade is that you can now make some area damage with the exploding arrows if you miss the target. The final ability is that you can quickly charge your bow(you go faster). The first upgrade and se second are the same - you carge the bow faster and almost instantly.As the game goes on, you can find certain objects to make the thief either grow in health or use an amulet to revive without the checkpoint/level.There is the knight:  The Knight has certain Abilities that will be useful to the Three Heroes - though I think he is pretty useless, the only good thing is that he can fight enemies faster and has a shild to protect you from falling objects. I do think the moves slower than the other two characters, or I just dislike him so much.The Knight has a sword and a shield, and the first upgrade to this ability is that you have a better critical hit. The second upgrade is that you have a flaming sword, which is nice because the whole sword is on fire and it can also be used to ignote torches, just like the thief can.The next ability is the strenght. Here the first upgrade is to pick up objects - but it only works if you have energy so you can 'call the Gods'. The second upgrade is the inhuman speed that can either kill enemies or knock them back. It's a pretty cool lightning effect.The last perk is the hammer. You can use it if your mage is dead and you can't conjour boulders to destroy walls. The first upgrade is to unleash a secondary attack and deal massive damage and the second one is to perform the same attack with massive damage but while jumping from a ledge. Objects:  As I said, in Trine, there are many magical and ordinary Items that can be used throughout the levels.First of all there are the chests. 2/level - they contain special skills or unlocks the abilities for the characters, thus you have chests with artifacts or abillities. Secondly, the experience. Experience points are gained by collecting the special experience vials and also by killing enemies. These experience points count towards upgrading the abilities of the Three Heroes.Next, the inventory items. The majority has either healing powers or mana. Amulet of the Kings, Amulent of Energy Gain and so on. But there are a few that actually helps throughout the game, such as the Wolfgand Music Box - increses the number of boxes the wizard can conjour by two; The Gem of Ressurection - allows the character to ressurect once per level; The Scales of Fish - allows breathing under water - unlimited time and the Victor's Crown - allows the wizard to increse the number of planks by two.Final thoughs:I liked Trine. The storyline gradually unfolded throughout the game by the narrator. You discover new abilities and tend to have a liking over a character(I preffer the Thief) and you cand spend hours playing, because the game is worth it. I recommend it.In the past ages, three powerful artifacts were created, that had been used to balance all of the good and evil in the world - go find them and enjoy.			",81,18,4,7,7,0,4

												An excellent game with a wonderful atmosphere and a really relaxing soundtrack.You play three characters, all of them unique and with their own strengths and weaknesses, between which you can switch at will. There's also a small skill-tree to explore: each character has three skills, each of which can be upgraded twice.During your travels through the levels you may find various ""secrets"" (items). They will be automatically assigned to one of your characters, though you can always switch the inventories around.The levels are pretty short and cleanly divided, so it's easy to ration your play time.For someone looking for a challenge this might be too easy, as I started playing on hardest difficulty right away and don't really think it's all that hard (supposedly there are more enemies and they hit harder, but the puzzles stay the same). But then there's also the hardcore mode, which I have yet to try out.The puzzles are pretty simple.I can recommend this to everyone who enjoys platformers and beautiful sceneries, adults and children (10+?*) alike.* there is no gore or anything and the game might also be okay for children younger than that, but I'd always rather be safe than sorry			",431,209,10,71,38,7,60

Great fun and there are achievements for the hardcore people too. Can be quite annoying likeRochard was with it's long jumps and constant trying again to pass a tough spot. Last level also has a quite big difficutly leap so better learn all the tricks. Luckily youtube will help you if you forget. :) Played this one through in small diggestable pieces so it's good for people with little time on their hands.			",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

												Having played Trine 2 a small amount on Playstation 4, I sort of knew what I was getting myself into... but since I never finished the second game and I now have all three to the Trine games, I thought I'd start at the beginning of the series.This is a puzzle platformer with some RPG elements and it's GREAT at that. The puzzles are fair, the platforming is good and the RPG elements are just putting skill points into various skills (there are not that many, but they're all useful in one way or another).The story in the game is in short that the Thief, the Wizard and the Knight were all drawn to the same artifact which resided in the Astral Academy, why they don't know but they all got stuck together in it. In the beginning, they didn't like it but they grew fond of it. Well, in short... the king died, he didn't have any children to take the throne so in the chaos which followed, an undead army took the chance to ravage the land... and the three heroes have to stop the army and its leader.Oh. I almost forgot... graphics. GORGEOUS! It's hard to not stop running around and just look at the backgrounds, so beautiful. The sound is just as great. The soundtrack is soothing, the voice acting is AMAZINGLY good and hits just the right spot. The controls are near perfect, at least with an Xbox 360 controller.I thought it was great and I must thank my brother for gifting me this game way back in like 2014 or something along those lines. Truly do recommend this game. I don't see any reason not to give this a shot.			",488,140,8,67,38,6,70

												This game was an unexpected pleasure. The best way I found to enjoy it is to not ask too much of it, and simply let it be the casual gameplay experience it was meant to be. I bought the game because the gameplay videos showed the characters moving slowly and gracefully, and that chill pacing was with me throughout my playthrough. Here's how it breaks down:The Good - Here is an excellent title if you are looking for some laid-back fun. The game's pacing was just fast enough to keep things interesting, but slow enough to give you the time to take in the visuals and play with the game's 2D physics. The story was present enough to give the game some direction, but was unconcerned with details and complexity just like a picture book (and with the 2D gameplay and rich backgrounds it certainly felt like a picture book sometimes). The character control was pretty tight, not perfect, but close enough that I didn't find myself frustrated trying to jump onto small ledges. All of these elements came together to make for a pleasant few hours. The Bad - My only real complaint is that I wish there was more content (and I am downloading Trine 2 as I write this review so hopefully that will help). I finished the whole thing in about five hours. I had no technical issues. My controller worked perfectly and the game looked excellent without stutter or other problems. The Verdict - This is not a flashy game. It is not tense or super-fast-paced. You will not feel the rush of victory or the crush of defeat, because it never feels like much is at stake. But if you play this game with the understanding that it is a casual experience, and you are okay with something a little simpler, then I think you will find this game a comfortable match.

												A friend of mine got me to buy the whole trilogy, so I'll review each of the three games on their respective pages.Visuals: The game is really pretty, I must say. The environments you travel through are beautiful almost the entire time. There are a few spots that look like generic corridors, but they are not very frequent.Music: The music is good, but the tracks are very short, meaning the music quickly becomes repetitive to the point of being annoying. You also can't turn it off completely, only lower its volume significantly, so once the music becomes annoying, you can't escape it.Story: The story is... alright... I guess... Not desperately interesting though. It feels more like an excuse plot than something that was given high priority.Combat: The combat is acceptable, has a nice flow to it, and there are multiple ways to approach it. However, the boss fights aren't particularly interesting. (There are also technically only two bosses. All subsequent ones are copy-pasted versions of them.)Platforming: This is what really brings the game down. The most important part of any platformer is to have good... well... platforming. This game does not. You frequently find yourself struggling against inconsistent collision boxes. The grappling hook helps, but it has restrictions on what angles you can shoot it in, and has a tendency to mess up the physics simulation occasionally.Other points of note: The final level increases the difficulty significantly. It's still manageable, but can easily get frustrating if you haven't yet gotten used to the awkward platforming.In conclusion: The game is acceptable, I guess... But not something I would recommend. The short music loops and frustrating platforming issues are the main things that bring it down. Most aspects of the game are kinda average, but the visuals are great. I can see how others would like the game, but I personally don't.(A quick note about the other games in the series: Trine 2 fixes most of the issues that this first game has, and is actually a pretty good game. Trine 3, on the other hand, has a couple of other issues that bring it down again.)			",31,6,0,5,4,0,1

												Trine is a charming puzzle platformer with some light action elements. The artwork is gorgeous, the  soundtrack is great and the gameplay is fun. The Enchanted Edition is a port of the original game to the Trine 2 engine and the improved graphics still hold up surprisingly well.The game is rather reminiscent of Lost Vikings and puts you in control of three different characters with different abilities. Unlike in Lost Vikings, most of the puzzles in Trine are physics based. Unfortunately they all tend to be on the easy side. Especially late in the game you are given so many tools that pretty much any puzzle becomes trivial.The combat is rather casual too, and overall I found the game quite easy even on hard difficulty. The last two levels are significantly more challenging, though. At least you can switch difficulty on the fly, so this shouldn't be a major issue.Despite these minor faults Trine is a highly enjoyable game that's recommended to anyone who likes platformers.The good:- Beautiful art that still holds up quite well- Fun Lost Vikings inspired gameplay- Interesting fairytale story- Great soundtrackThe bad:- Big difficulty bump for the last two missions. The game is really easy even on hard before those two			",558,228,11,89,48,8,102

												It's very difficult to know where to start. On one hand, I feel like putting some thoughts together regarding Trine is well overdue, whilst on the other hand, it's actually fairly daunting. Trine has appealed to me in more ways than I expected when I first sat down to play it, and even now, on my third or fourth playthrough, I still find myself swept away by the game's grandeur.Trine's outstanding visual aesthetics and compelling soundtrack are just the tip of the iceberg as solid gameplay and well implemented puzzles expose the game's true beauty.Full review with screenshots here: http://twolofbees.com/cheesetalks/trine.php ",315,129,2,22,29,5,58

												What a beautiful game. If there are any people out there who have read my other reviews with any regularity, you know that I am not a fan of puzzle platformers. With early access and indie development being so accessible, the market is flooded with crappy 2D platformers and just the thought of them puts a sour taste in many peoples mouths.Trine enters the “2 1/2”D realm because the environment and models are all done in gorgeous 3D and it is only movement which is restricted to a flat plane. The gameplay actually surprised me because it focuses a good amount on combat, bringing in a sort of metroidvania feel without the exhaustive and often tedious backtracking. You can freely swap between one of three characters: a knight, thief and wizard. The knight is a go-to for combat while the thief covers mobility and the wizard... well he makes boxes. I found myself almost exclusively using the thief while only briefly swapping to the wizard to spawn in a box or plank. Meanwhile the knight sat around in limbo collecting dust between boss fights. It really felt like the characters were extremely balanced on paper but in practice the thief really is the main character, only needing the wizard to make some new platforms and the knight to smack around anything she can’t keep at bay with her bow.The good parts of Trine are really good, and while I feel that the characters aren’t balanced quite right this doesn’t take away from the writing, animation and overall quality this game brings to the table.

												Trine is a game I can't recommend enough.  It's a physics platformer with a rather unique mechanic of 3 playable characters.  They are tied together by magic so you can switch between them at any time and use their abilities to make your way through the levels.  Puzzles are quite varied requiring a number of different strategies, especially if you want to collect all the experience orbs which can be quite difficult to reach.  All of the characters are well-balanced and necessary to proceed through the game.  The game is also very well-written and acted which is a welcome change from most platformers.Where Trine really shines though is the graphics.  The art in this game is absolutely stunning and it's amazing how well it runs even on older hardware.  It also makes use of nVidia PhysX for high quality physics simulation (nVidia hardware not required.)  The world and levels are very well designed and quite engrossing as well.The only thing this game is missing is coop, but that was added for the sequel which is just as awesome.  Play them both!  You won't regret it.			",862,200,24,72,69,9,114

Depending on the situation, you can choose the character that you need.  This game is so beautiful that not even my screenshots do it justice.  Yep, I'm that impressed.  If you're looking for a fun game, and you love magic, then this game is for you.   I highly recommend it.  A great buy too.  :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personally I really can't recommend this game enough.The story, the setting, the graphics, the artdesign, the music, the sound effects, the voiceacting (even in german) and the level design are perfectly blended into a package of pure fun and excitement.Because you have three characters for play at once there are nearly always different ways of solving a problem. Sometimes you have to switch rapidly between the charakters to get one particular problem done. Some other time you can choose which way of progress suits you the most.I think this game is one of the best 2D (ok the graphics are 3D so I assume it's one of those modern called ""2.5D"" game-enignes) platformers you can get today though I must say I haven't played the second part yet and I hope it will be even better than this part of the series.There are demos available of both parts of the gage. Go on, download them, be stunned by the exellence of execution in this title and then buy it. It's worth every penny even more though it's on discount on nearly a regular basis.There is only one thing that annoys me a little and that is the impossibility to look up or down. There are a few spots, even in the earlier levels, where you simply fall to death and there is no glimpse of a warning. I've played games where at least you can move near the edge and the player character gives a sign wether it's possible to jump down a hole or not. Maybe this would be a nice addition to any future parts of the series. And jesus how I hope they'll do any.As there are really fair and nearly too much checkpoints throughout the levels this is only a minor flaw and doesn't diffuse gameplay flow too much but it could have been solved nicer the way I described above ... nonetheless ...... if you are a fan of 2D action platformers with puzzle elements you simply HAVE to buy this game.You most likely won't regret it !!!

												Trine really reminds me of the good old day playing ""Castlevania: Symphony of the Night"" - beautiful graphic, wonderful music, awesome gameplay - although there are many differences between these two games.The physical setting of the game, well, I must admit the developer did a very excellent job. Rather than hack and slash, you can step on lesser enemies, swing yourself (by grappling hook) to crack them, or perform other stylish tricks to fight.Most of the puzzles can be solved by different characters with different methods. Well, let talk about the Wizard guy; he can create objects and throw them onto spikes, leting himself pass unharmed - which is pretty cool.Trine is one of the greatest games you can't miss on Steam, and you don't want to miss its soundtrack.

												Just finished Trine in the free-weekend.I wanted to play this game for a while, and I took advantage of this opportunity to finally try it out. I am not disappointed, but I'm not fully pleased either.TL;DR review = Beautiful looking game, impressive degree of immersion for the genre through graphics, sounds and writing. Gameplay mechanics are not terrible, but they are the weakest link in this game. Not a deal breaker though, game is worth a try.TL review:Gameplay: I know quick-time events are not a necessity for side-scrolling platformers, but when you have a rich 3d environment and heavy physics, they become important. Case in point, the grapling hook from the Thief seems often buggy (often goes through stuff you can jump on, breaks with no clear reason, etc), staying on platform edges or jumping on them can be more tricky than it should, and creating platforms with the wizard can prove difficult if there's the slightest denivalation in the terrain (boxes start to roll, etc). Combat is pretty repetitive and non-interesting, you don't have a lot of moves/attacks, and enemies have an attack animation that doesn't really land with the effect.One more thing; this might be an intended mechanic, or because of time and/or development constraints was not implentend: moving/dropping non-attached stuff with your wizard. It kind of feels like moving an object in editing software; physics are mostly there for the move part, but the drop part is just like dropping from a fixed point with no velocity, no matter what.GraphicsThis is where the game shines. It looks gorgeus. There's a heavy accent on colours and detail, a beautiful 3d environment with a fixed side-scrolling 2d camera. The style gives every setting the feeling of magic, especially the outdoor forest parts. It's also not extremely demanding, at least in the original version; I was able to run it with an acceptable framerate on an outdated low-end laptop, and it looked great. Enchanted Edition wasn't all that spec friendly :D. DesignStory - Not bad. It's sort of like a narrative that you knew as a child, a tale of heroes bound together, who overcome obstacles to reach individual goals, but find that their bond changes their perception, and seemingly work together for the greater good.Sounds - The music in this game is great. It fits perfectly with the story/writing, and with the adequate graphics behind it, it's conveying a sense of immersion. The sound effects and voice acting aren't bad either, but it's the music that truly shines.Levels - The levels are not too difficult, ergo this game is not too difficult. You may find it troublesome to get some achievements, but all in all it's pretty balanced, at last until the last level, which seems to jump the volume of difficulty to 150% (from 100% obviously...idk, I had no better analogy...). Again, it's not THAT difficult, it's just that the game progresses really smoothly in difficulty, not really increasing or decreasing by much, and at the last one, BOOM, it's like you switched from normal to hard (this game doesn't have a difficulty option, btw).ConclusionWell...what can I say, I enjoyed it, even though gameplay mechanics kind of frustrated me. I'll put some of that on my rig though, and considering I'm recommending this game, what I found problematic isn't that much of a problem.			",49,6,4,3,4,0,5

												Even on its own, Trine is a visual puzzle-platform delight, containing 15 levels (plus 1 bonus level) for you to journey through. If you remember the old console game ""The Lost Vikings"", then know that this is a slightly faster-paced version with more emphasis on combat, as well as beautiful backdrops to the various levels.The game has you play as 3 characters (wizard, thief, and knight) fused into one existence; during play, you can freely call in one of the three to handle fights or puzzles, while the other two hover in a mental limbo. Depending on your tastes, you may relish the idea that the game's puzzles are generally flexible, and let a player choose one of many ways to solve a puzzle. You can conjure planks as a wizard to reach a ledge, or simply grapple to the top as a thief. Even combat is up to you, fight head-on as a knight, at range as a thief, or use a wizard to conjure blocks that crush.Though the game has its downsides. The enemies are bland, with only a majority of skeletons and two other generic creatures. After a while, combat with them becomes a chore to check-off inbetween puzzles. The story is nice, but has little involvement with the gameplay, as the plot comes in verbal chunks during 3 sections: the loading screen; the level beginning; and the level end. The game itself is quite linear and straight-forward, with only small branches that lead to secret collectibles, that in turn upgrade the three heroes' abilities.However, note that this game has a Local Co-op option that I did not try.Overall, this game is more like an appetizer instead of a main course; it lets you get used to how the game mechanics work and tells you the backstory of Trine 2, and you could finish this in less than a day. If you strip away the distractions of plot and combat, Trine is purely a quick (though not without some thought) mildly-challenging puzzle game. Still, I heartily recommend this game as it is a brisk body-swapping romp through a scenic fantasy world. If you want this game, get it purely for its pretty puzzles.NOTE: Trine is packaged with Trine 2 in the packages ""Trine Complete"" and ""Frozenbyte Collection"" which may make your purchase more worthwhile, particularly during a Steam Sale.

												An excellent addition to the Puzzle Platformer category. I've only palyed for about three hours, but I was immediately hooked on the game. The various characters are interesting and there is a strong sense of storytelling through gameplay. I enjoy listening to the dialogue between the characters as I run through the level. What I think is great about this game is that there are so many different ways to solve each problem, I find myself abusing the Wizard's ability to summon boxes to give myself an extra jump by jumping onto the box as it falls. There appear to be some balancing issues with the characters upgrades and items. My Wizard's inventory is chock full of energy related items and my poor Theif has but a poison potion. As I see it there is very little use for the Knight's lift/throw ability because the wizard can move items around more efficiently and as an attack it is much slower and weaker than his sword.Aside from that it's a wonderful game makes you think as you go careening through beautifully done levels trying to search for experience. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenging Puzzle Platformer and well done voiceovers.			",34,10,0,5,3,0,4

												After playing through this game, I really love its interface along with the ability to feel like a final fantasy player view while having the free roam characteristics of a side scroller without being bogged down by multi-character screen position. It's like having three characters in one....oh wait....that's exactly what it is, and the character swap is nicely displayed and usually easy to use unless you are in a huge hurry. In all, I give the game a 9/10 for minus one just for being a side-scroller, it didn't hit the max for I have played many side-scrollers which were better.			",245,62,4,32,30,3,39

												Trine is an excellent game. I am not normally a fan of platformers, but this one is great. I love the colors in the game as well as the gameplay. The stroy line is a fairy tale, but that doesn't make it bad. Throughout the story, you get to play as three different heros, each with their own unique abilities. There are many fun puzzles to solve throughout the game. Trine was a steal at $0.99. Such a great game.			",96,9,3,10,12,0,2

												Trine is a very enjoyable side-scroller with interesting gameplay mechanics and gorgeous 3D-rendered environments. It has a generic fantasy story that pokes fun at itself and the 3 playable characters are well voiced and funny as they interact and clash with one another. The many levels are diverse and dense with hidden pickups/loot and physics puzzles that draw equally on all 3 characters' abilities, which keeps the gameplay dynamic.Maybe I could come up with something bad to say about this game if I really tried, but I can't think of anything off the top of my head. Highly recommended!			",355,83,0,30,14,0,15

												I enjoy a variety of types of games. Trine Enchanted Edition has absolutely beautiful scenery and wonderful music. Being able to easily switch between characters is great fun. I am not just stuck being a thief, mage, or knight. I am all three. I am now playing it through for the second time (on the hard setting) and this time I notice even more of the detail put into the game and the story. I haven't done multiplayer yet.  It is just too much fun alone, but maybe I'll try if a friend gets the game.  I look forward to playing Trine 2.			",33,31,0,2,1,0,1

												First of all, buy this game! I am not really a fan of platformers and puzzle games but I really loved this one. And there are dozens of reasons I did.Gameplay: It feels like an old school platformer with all the running and jumping across the screen, but it gives you something more than that. Unique abilities of the heroes allows you to make your own choices of how you want to cross a gap or how you want to get to some extra experience points. Moreover, you can vary methods of getting rid off your enemies - making it shooting an arrow (thief), waving your sword (knight) or smashing them with a box (wizard). The puzzles player encounter through the game are not hard at all, still hard enough to feel satisfaction of getting through from time to time. Maybe that doesn't sound that fun or new, but believe me this is really entertaining. The only down thing about the gameplay is Boss fights that feel repetitive and rather dumb - hit & jump.Gaphics: The game has unique atmosphere and the art of each level is just beautiful. I found myself feeling really enjoying the picture. Enchanted Edition stands for enhanced graphics edition for the original game and it feels pretty up-to-date.Controls: Strange thing - I tried to play the game using Xbox controller and found mouse and keyboard far better way of playing the game. Still it is pretty much playable using gamepad. I was also happy to find out that there is a local co-op mode in the game which allows you to play the game with your friends using gamepads and mouse & keyboard at one machine.Verdict: This game has a really strong impression on me. I was surprised how I got into it easily and spent first two hours feeling like it was only 15 minutes. I really like spending some time after work playing it - feels relaxing. And after I finish this one there are still Trine 2 and 3 that await me.I recommend it to all of you guys.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trine!! Such a great idea and also well implemented... what else can you ask for? This is one of those games that are kind of special to me, along with its sequel Trine 2. Athough the game was launched in 2009, the developers updated the game not long ago with a lot of new stuff. I never really paid too much attention to the story of the game, but that's just because the game is so fun that I was always eager to get started. The gameplay mechanics are great, I love how each character does different things and serves a different role within the group. In fact, I'd recommend playing this game with your significant other/housecarl. This is one of those great co-op games, definitely perfect for a couple or maybe even some friends... so long as there are just 3 of you! It is true that the game is not hard at all, with the exception of the last stages,  but even on easy it'll take you some time to find everything in the game and discover all its secrets. I just managed to get all the achievements and it took me about 15 hours, but I'd say the main game would take you about 6 or 7 hours. Definitely more if you replay some of the stages, or if you like to go treasure hunting like me!  Oh, and in case none of your friends have the game but you still want to collaborate with other people while playing, remember that Trine also has an online mode. Besides all this, the game is in a lot of different languages and the dubbing is also very good in all the versions I've heard so far. I'd mention its cons, but I simply don't see any. Don't think about it too much, just choose the knight, the thief or the wizard and find that elusive Trine before it's too late!			",294,108,1,50,22,3,48

												Trine is a fun and well made puzzle platformer. I think it's quite similar to Deadlight in terms of gameplay and the side-scrolling look although here you can change between three different characters at any time. I wouldn't say it's that great but it's a good example of that type of game.			",1920,829,74,198,246,21,315

												First word that comes to mind when I think about this game is... Beautiful! The graphics in this game are trully outstanding. The setting takes place in a magical world, and visuals transport the player right into it. Apart from this, the gameplay is very original, and although it takes a little while to get used to, once you get into the game it can be a true godsend :) I would class this game as a casual action / puzzle / platformer. It is an easy-to-play kind of game, during which you can just relax and enjoy the scenery. This may be a downside to those who enjoy a challenge (especially when it comes to enemies, as these don't really get any harder throughout the game), but overall it is an utterly enjoyable experience.There is also a lot of storyline which is definitely worth following.

												I was very happy from start to finish playing Trine. Trine is a relatively short platformer that uses 3 distinct characters with unique skills to help you progress and collect all the experience bottles throughout each level. You can change characters on the fly just by pressing 1, 2 or 3. The visuals are stunning and I was constantly just looking at the scenery. The sound is equally good, with fantastic music that suited each level. It's worth noting the sound effects were all great and of very high quality. There are several different enemies and ""bosses"" throughout the game. However, the enemies lack variety and will constantly repeat over and over. I put bosses in quotes because they are actually quite easy. Maybe mini-bosses is a better term. Trine is a very forgiving game (played on the default difficulty). It's easy to pick up and play a level. It never gets very difficult and has a very generous checkpoint/revival system. The story is as good as it can be for a game like this. There's not much too it, but it’s conveyed well to the player through a fantastic narrator. The controls are ok. Sometimes I got frustrated with my character motion and jumping onto ledges. But it is a minor gripe. To fix my framerate stutter +I ran an uncapped fps and left it to vsync to run at 60fps. This caused stuttering every couple of seconds. I fixed this by telling Trine in the options to run at a capped 60fps. Completely smooth after thatFix input lag+Another easy fix. My mouse input lag was pretty bad. Trine has an option to reduce lag. You'll want to put a check mark in that boxPros+Beautifully styled graphics.+Sound design is solid.+Overall platforming is fun.+Game rewards you (with experience) for exploring corners and trying to find the secret chests.+Smooth 60fps+Stable. Never crashed on my Windows 8.1 machine+Great narrator voice acting.+Fun puzzles and having to think how to progress furtherCons+Not much to the story.+At times I fought with the controls+Default difficulty could be a little more challenging+Only a few useful power-ups. A lot of them don't affect the characters much. (This may change when played on a harder difficulty)+Very few unique enemies.8/10 Very goodI would absolutely recommend Trine. The regular price of $14.99 seems a little much. I would not pass this up if it goes on sale. I got the Trine collections for $2.49 during the 2014 Summer Sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is for the original, non-enchanted edition as I had already started with the original and never found the time to finish it of until now. I may go through the game again on enchanted to see what differences there are besides better graphics....and while I'm at it, I might as well go for 100% completion so that means getting the remaining achievements I haven't already got from running with the original....Oooohhh, I don't know why I started this on Hard difficulty(but didn't change it because I don't like changing difficulty half way through a game so I stuck with it)....hahaha - guess I thought I could take the heat! Apparently not so died so many times! hahaha... Actually I probably won't bother with 100% achievement completion(But I will try to get as close to that though) as I just took a glance and one of them was completing it on the hardest difficulty, which would be the next level up from Hard as this is the 2nd hardest(unless there's harder - there's apparently hardcore mode mentioned in the descriiption of that achievement....). Anyways, it's a puzzle, platformer, action and adventure game. That's what the genres should be, but it was tagged as only action adventure... So you start the game when the three characters collide with each other and combined into one being(I can't remember the exact details on how this happened as I started the game a couple or so years ago but never finished it), they are the Thief, Knight and Wizard. Thief's a  woman and the other two are guys. So are set out to find the other two powers(I forgot what the other two were called - lol and just finished a several minutes ago! haha), you have Trine. After that, the three beings as one will seperate into themselves again. So gameplay is you can do local coop, or coop on seperate PCs and can play each of three characters, or if you don't have people to play with you can solo it, like I did. When soloing, you can switch between the three to use their unique abilities and strengths to overcome obstacles in your way. I would imagine it would be more fun and quicker/easier if you had someone or two to play with and they control the other two characters... If you know platform type games like oldschool mario, then I don't need to explain any further as it's similar to that, with added puzzles. If not, then you basically jump and down - killing and or avoiding enemies, solving puzzles, and the screen sidescrolls for you automatically as you progress into the level. Graphics, yeah I thought the original Trine graphics was nice and pretty with everything maxed. Had average fps  of about 67-ish. The physic in this game, which uses nVidia's PhysX system, was awesome! Another one of those rare PhysX games. Audio, well I can say that it actually made full use of my 7.2 surround sound setup - surprised as it's a sidescroller platformer type game which I would have though stereo would be enough, but nope! The atmosphere and music was great! The voice overs were cool too. Sound effects were nice. I believe it must be thanks to the EAX checkbox I ticked....Um not sure what else to say...I liked it enough to give it a thumbs up, though some of the parts are fustrating especially the timing bits and to add skeletons attacking you at the sametime that you have to avoid or and kill off....hah....the last level.....oh god......almost raged but got through it in the end! hahahaha Oh and once you've finished the game, you unlock a harder difficulty, Very Hard - which I'm not even gonna bother with(Hard was fustrating enough for me thanks!)...hahahaha...also there's a new level that unlocks which appears to be similar to the last level of the game.........................................................So yeah....you like solving puzzles? Like a bit of adventure, action too? Do you like them platformer type sidescrolling games as well?

												What an absolute joy to play and a really beautiful looking game. As far as platformers go this has actually been more fun for me, if of course less challenging, than Super Meat Boy which is one of the best platformers of all time. The colours, sound and voice acting are all so well created and put together that I struggle to find any flaws with the presentation and audio. The story is very simple as you would imagine so if you're looking for some sort of epic tale then this is probably not going to be first on your list. Controls are fluid although you cannot use a controller, something which I believe they fixed in the second edition to this series. I couldn't reccomend this game more to people who enjoy platformers or want to support good indie gaming or hell even people who just like looking at something pretty. Replay value is pretty high as there are tons of secrets and achievements to conquer as well as hard and very hard difficulty modes respectively. Overall a brilliant game and well worth the asking price on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is beautiful. It's fun. It manages not to frustrate the hell out of you. Plus the lovely Thief has the voice of Isabela from Dragon Age 2. You can shoot skeletons, smash 'em, chop 'em or just drop something heavy onto them. The puzzles are not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like they are in some games and... wheee grappling hoooooooo...Quite frankly, the visuals are stunning. I'm normally not one to focus on graphics but Trine is really excellent. Which is good, because it's not one of the soulless, mass-produced turds that get released so much lately. That could tempt you to think it's just the visuals. but no, as I said - while it depends on the player, I found the balance between combat, puzzles and platforming quite appealing. There are also things to pick up for all the completionists, so you might find yourself replaying Trine if you're that kind of a person. I guess my main gripe with the game could be that it doesn't really have big flaws. It's not frustrating, you might actually consider that one. I don't. The game isn't really particularly hard, except possibly finding all the hidden thingamajigs. While there's not much of variety in opponents, they're not exactly the main focus either and the levels actually show variety. Which is pretty good, as copy-pasting is a pretty nasty sin.Trine hits quite a few nice spots and it calls back to the nostalgia days of Super Mario, just without taking the wrong cues - instead of picking up the ugly graphics and frustration, it takes the spirit of platforming and adds a spin on it. And while it uses physics for its puzzles, it avoids the pitfalls of that fairly well, delivering quite consistent results to what you do. It also gives you freedom to approach a few places in different ways, which is good - but as my memory serves, that resulted in me mostly using the Thief and the Wizard, with the Knight just doing bugger all except freak accidents when he was actually needed.The game is pretty good, if a little short. I'm a bit on the fence whether it's a good thing or not, but then again it does avoid the pitfall of stretching everything too far and lets you have some carefree fun in between things. It's not even particularly rough around the edges, so it's definitely worth checking out.			",310,62,5,66,55,4,91

												Not a bad game, especially if it can be had for cheap.The graphics are good, and (for what it is) the writing is okay-ish. It has a bit of humour, and has personality that many games which cost five times as much would kill for. You can tell a lot of love went into this game.SADLY, it's really janky. The platforming mixed with physics can be really frustrating to play, not because it's difficult, but because it's not very accurate. This can lead to lots of ""miscalcuated"" jumps, and whatnot.Besides that, there's really not much variety to the game, and the core mechanics of switching between Wizard, Thief and Knight to battle and solve physics puzzles really don't cut it after a couple of hours.I'd be hard pushed to recommend this game at £6.99 unless you have a real itch for a physics-based puzzle/action/platformer. But if it's more than 25% off in a sale, go for it!3/5			",351,182,8,50,31,0,46

Enemies aren't difficult, makes you feel smart getting past obstacles, relaxing scenery and music. Only took 5-6 hours to beat but unfortunately not much replayability.

The effects from the hammer attacks looks godly and the different maps are very short, but I like them more. Enemies looks like poop, but I did enjoy this game more than the second one (which also is awesome).Nothing negative to say, just miss some things that you can do from Trine 2, but regardless of that, I think this game is worth every penny. Even at full price. Very short game though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A pretty cool indie platformer. I never actually beat it since it didn't spark my interest that much, but lets just say that if a serial killer locked me in a room and forced me to play this, I wouldn't kill myself. The graphics are the best part, and the different powers are cool and all, but the thief kind of breaks the game with her grappling hook. Cheers to the developers for making a fun game though, I hear Trine II is quite awesome as well.			",244,63,6,23,19,4,22

												Trine is a very accessible yet rather innovative platformer. The gameplay is extremely fluid and intuitive, and the graphics are nice to look at. Unlocking all of the achievements provides a decent challenge and incentive to find all of the collectables in each level. The game is quite short, but that's not necessarily a bad thing in this case. For what the game does, it does it very well.			",40,7,0,9,1,0,3

												I seriously LOVE this game. You will, too. Go play it. It's a physics-based puzzle-platformer with combat as well, with collectibles. It seriously has everything. You can alternate at will with three different characters, a knight (good at fighting, has a shileld, can smash things), a thief (ranged weapon, can grapple to things), and a wizard (who can summon boxes, planks and floating platforms). Each level is filled with traps, platforms, undead skeletons summoned around you to attack, and you're constantly switching between characters. Want to kill that far-off archer? Use your thief to shoot it. Surrounded by melee baddies? Use your knight. Need to cross a dangerous pit? Use your wizard to summon things to make a path. There are tons of different ways to play, too. Trying to reach a high up ledge with a collecible on it? You can 1) shoot down the wood planks holding it up (if possible), 2) platform jump some tricky moves, 3) build a tower of blocks or a plank bridge and just walk right over to it, 4) summon something and use it to knock the collectible from the ledge to the ground. There are certain tasks that can only be done with a certain character, or need to be done with a certain character if you haven't upgraded another one sufficiently, but usually there are tons of different ways to brute force a problem.Pros:+Great art. Fantasy setting with lots of giant mushrooms and sparkling fairy plants in woodland settings, creepy dungeons with lava, broken down castles with poisonous goop.+Adjustable difficulty. The default is medium (which is what I played at) and there are sometimes a bunch of baddies swarming on you all at once, but they're usually three weak hits to kill the weak ones, then you start getting better equipped baddies with shield or armor that take more hits. You can play on easy and (I assume) have less baddies or easier to kill ones, or harder if you like a challenge. I'm going to definitely replay on a harder difficulty at some point because this game is truly awesome.+Pretty good music, never setting too serious a tone to fit the style of the game. Baroque fantasy.+MANY ways to solve puzzles, and they're never TOO challenging. Very fun.+Variety of puzzles. Running away from lava, fighting spiders in the dark, low-stress puzzles, complicated platform jumping, etc.+Decent voice acting. Not amazing (except for maybe the thief), but not intrusive or annoying.+XP and leveling. You collect XP through fighting, but also as collectibles. So the more adventurous you are trying to find the hidden ones, the more you level. There's a limited but interesting set of skills to upgrade, making your fighter tougher and making him charge and fling objects at people, and allowing your wizard to summon more objects, making puzzle and platforming easier, and making your thief shoot more arrows, or light things on fire, etc.+Fair checkpoints. Also, if one of your characters dies, you can switch to another. Anytime you want to revive a dead one, just go back to a checkpoint and they return with limited health. This helps A LOT if you really need the wizard for a puzzle but he just got murdered.Cons:-Uh...I'm getting really nitpicky here, because it's just a superbly fun, well-crafted game, but the final boss level has very few checkpoints, but it's the boss so I totally understand.10/10. Will play again. And the sequel.			",44,70,0,5,2,1,6

												This game is about a Wizard, a Thief and a Knight who's souls stuck together by a mysterious stone. Now our heroes will search for the Trine to be free again.In this game, you will be controlling one character who can transfer into another character whenever you want! you can switch between Magic (wizard), Fast movement (Thief) and the Tank (Knight) in-combat. This game is 2D but has insanly great 3D graphics wich are very fun to watch. As the Wizard, you can create blocks, brightes and flying platforms wich will help him in the battle / moving distances, the Thief weilds a bow and a hook that can help her jump above spikes / other dangerous things, with the bow she can kill enemies easly from a distance. The Knight has a sword and a shield, with the shield he can block attacks from monsters / spike balls, witht he sword he could do a very high DPS.Pros:1. The game is 2D but it's 3D (lol) that means the game is 3D but you can only move < ^ > with the character.2. The soundtrack is great and looks perfectly with the game's story / graphics.3. Combat system is very fun, imagine yourself knocking your enemy with the Knight and switching to the Thief to finish the enemy.4. Character switching. You can easly change your character from the Wizard, to the Thief or to the Knight with 3 buttons: 1 , 2 , 3. You can do it in mid-air, you can do it while running... you can do it whenever you want.Cons:1. The game is too short D: . After 8 hours of playing it, the game still looks short. Well it looks short for me :).Graphics: 10/10.Combat: 10/10.Story: 8/10.I'd give this game a metascore of 90+/100.  ",202,29,11,15,12,3,10

												Trine is an extremely unique platformer requiring the use of all three of the characters to complete levels. The game is rather straight forward and simple once you get the hang of the character switch and their respective ablities. It can be made much more interesting when playing on Very Hard difficulty and attempting all the acheivements, which I highly recommend. The level design and art is absolutely beautiful, and if nothing else play the game just for that. It isn't too time consuming, and 100% took less then 15 hours. Overall enjoyable, and absolutely gorgeous.			",125,11,6,17,17,2,15

Especially the end level was one that I had a lot of fun in. Overall, I'd say that Trine 1 is better than Trine 2, as Trine 1 feels more difficult whereas Trine 2 is more of a walk in the park. But, Trine 2 has better artwork, though Trine 1's artwork is nothing to scoff at.			",286,53,2,41,29,5,62

												Trine (Enhanced Edition) is a physics based puzzle-platformer. You take on the role of 3 adventures, a Knight, a Wizard and a Thief. you must use each of their skills as an individual (or all together if you play co-op) to make your way through each level, defeating monsters and puzzles alike.It is of course also worth noting, that if you hadn't noticed already: This game is gorgeous, the soundtrack fits perfectly, and the gameplay is sublime. It really is masterpiece of the genre(s), and is well worth your money.			",889,264,26,84,82,11,100

												One of my favourite co-op games. It's a lot of fun to play with casual gamer friends. Even more fun to regularly make them die by conjuring planks in front of their faces while they are jumping over a pit with acid in it, dropping skeletons on top of them mid-fight, or destroying summoned planks while they walk over them and thus dropping them in whatever green / red / blue stuff that will kill them :pPuzzles are nice, although quite easy. Makes it ideal for casual gamers and younger players. I'm neither, but still enjoy the game a lot because I play with friends. And yes indeed, I just wanted to show off I actually got friends ;) But seriously, it's a fun game!			",391,100,4,47,19,4,58

												An excellent addition to the Puzzle Platformer category. I've only palyed for about three hours, but I was immediately hooked on the game. The various characters are interesting and there is a strong sense of storytelling through gameplay. I enjoy listening to the dialogue between the characters as I run through the level. What I think is great about this game is that there are so many different ways to solve each problem, I find myself abusing the Wizard's ability to summon boxes to give myself an extra jump by jumping onto the box as it falls. There appear to be some balancing issues with the characters upgrades and items. My Wizard's inventory is chock full of energy related items and my poor Theif has but a poison potion. As I see it there is very little use for the Knight's lift/throw ability because the wizard can move items around more efficiently and as an attack it is much slower and weaker than his sword.Aside from that it's a wonderful game makes you think as you go careening through beautifully done levels trying to search for experience. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenging Puzzle Platformer and well done voiceovers.			",34,10,0,5,3,0,4

												After playing through this game, I really love its interface along with the ability to feel like a final fantasy player view while having the free roam characteristics of a side scroller without being bogged down by multi-character screen position. It's like having three characters in one....oh wait....that's exactly what it is, and the character swap is nicely displayed and usually easy to use unless you are in a huge hurry. In all, I give the game a 9/10 for minus one just for being a side-scroller, it didn't hit the max for I have played many side-scrollers which were better.			",245,62,4,32,30,3,39

												What an absolute joy to play and a really beautiful looking game. As far as platformers go this has actually been more fun for me, if of course less challenging, than Super Meat Boy which is one of the best platformers of all time. The colours, sound and voice acting are all so well created and put together that I struggle to find any flaws with the presentation and audio. The story is very simple as you would imagine so if you're looking for some sort of epic tale then this is probably not going to be first on your list. Controls are fluid although you cannot use a controller, something which I believe they fixed in the second edition to this series. I couldn't reccomend this game more to people who enjoy platformers or want to support good indie gaming or hell even people who just like looking at something pretty. Replay value is pretty high as there are tons of secrets and achievements to conquer as well as hard and very hard difficulty modes respectively. Overall a brilliant game and well worth the asking price on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trine is an excellent game. I am not normally a fan of platformers, but this one is great. I love the colors in the game as well as the gameplay. The stroy line is a fairy tale, but that doesn't make it bad. Throughout the story, you get to play as three different heros, each with their own unique abilities. There are many fun puzzles to solve throughout the game. Trine was a steal at $0.99. Such a great game.			",96,9,3,10,12,0,2

Gameplay is fun, there is alot of hidden stuff in the game, achievements are easy to get, none of them are impossible or near to.However, it might be a little bit easy, while the last stage and secret stage are ridiculously hard, especially on hardest difficulty.i'd definitly recommand this game to anyone that likes Platformers.Overall: 9/10.(a longer game with an online mode would give it a perfect score!)TRINE 2 HAS ONLINE CO-OP.Note; trine 1 still has LOCAL-CO-OP.

												When i first bought this game, i had a lot of suspition - thinking that this might be a huge waste of money. However, i was immediately shocked by the revelation that this is a beautifully crafted and perfected game. An adventure/RPG platformer, i refere to Trine as being a Mario-esque type of game, but with modern grafics. The creators of the game did a wonderfull job with perfecting the music, gameplay and feel of the game. It plays smooth, easy. The challenges are progressively hard, especially if you play on the hardest difficulty. Challenging. Thrilling. Beautiful. 10/10			",152,31,5,18,14,1,38

												After having neglected this game for a long time, I decided to give it a try. So, here are my impressions.Visuals: This game is a real feast for the eyes. I find it redundant to describe it in detail, since it's overall beautiful.Gameplay: The control interface is comfortable and is neither too simple, nor needlessly complicated. The interaction of the characters with their envoirment is on a highly satisfying level, be it objects or enemies. What surprised me in a pleasant way are the physics in the game, making the platforming and puzzles a fun and challenging experience. The combat is rather simple, but decently done for this type of game. Sound: No objections, just like a cherry on top of the cake it rounds up an enjoyable game.So far it sounds like this is a perfect game. But, it does have it flaws, mainly the sadistic difficulty of the final level. Be warned, this is one unforgiving level with literally no room for error. The reason why it is signifficantly harder than the rest of the game is that not only it punishes every big mistake with the need to restart the level, and that it is quite fast-paced compared to the other levels. Another point is the replay value. Once you've completed the game, that is all what the story can offer, it has no extra content, only higher difficulty. That hardly means the replay value is zero, on the contrary. Unless you replay it several times in rapid succession, you can always rediscover this games charms and try to complete every challenge it offers.The verdict: 8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is about a Wizard, a Thief and a Knight who's souls stuck together by a mysterious stone. Now our heroes will search for the Trine to be free again.In this game, you will be controlling one character who can transfer into another character whenever you want! you can switch between Magic (wizard), Fast movement (Thief) and the Tank (Knight) in-combat. This game is 2D but has insanly great 3D graphics wich are very fun to watch. As the Wizard, you can create blocks, brightes and flying platforms wich will help him in the battle / moving distances, the Thief weilds a bow and a hook that can help her jump above spikes / other dangerous things, with the bow she can kill enemies easly from a distance. The Knight has a sword and a shield, with the shield he can block attacks from monsters / spike balls, witht he sword he could do a very high DPS.Pros:1. The game is 2D but it's 3D (lol) that means the game is 3D but you can only move < ^ > with the character.2. The soundtrack is great and looks perfectly with the game's story / graphics.3. Combat system is very fun, imagine yourself knocking your enemy with the Knight and switching to the Thief to finish the enemy.4. Character switching. You can easly change your character from the Wizard, to the Thief or to the Knight with 3 buttons: 1 , 2 , 3. You can do it in mid-air, you can do it while running... you can do it whenever you want.Cons:1. The game is too short D: . After 8 hours of playing it, the game still looks short. Well it looks short for me :).Graphics: 10/10.Combat: 10/10.Story: 8/10.I'd give this game a metascore of 90+/100.  ",202,29,11,15,12,3,10

												This review is for the original, non-enchanted edition as I had already started with the original and never found the time to finish it of until now. I may go through the game again on enchanted to see what differences there are besides better graphics....and while I'm at it, I might as well go for 100% completion so that means getting the remaining achievements I haven't already got from running with the original....Oooohhh, I don't know why I started this on Hard difficulty(but didn't change it because I don't like changing difficulty half way through a game so I stuck with it)....hahaha - guess I thought I could take the heat! Apparently not so died so many times! hahaha... Actually I probably won't bother with 100% achievement completion(But I will try to get as close to that though) as I just took a glance and one of them was completing it on the hardest difficulty, which would be the next level up from Hard as this is the 2nd hardest(unless there's harder - there's apparently hardcore mode mentioned in the descriiption of that achievement....). Anyways, it's a puzzle, platformer, action and adventure game. That's what the genres should be, but it was tagged as only action adventure... So you start the game when the three characters collide with each other and combined into one being(I can't remember the exact details on how this happened as I started the game a couple or so years ago but never finished it), they are the Thief, Knight and Wizard. Thief's a  woman and the other two are guys. So are set out to find the other two powers(I forgot what the other two were called - lol and just finished a several minutes ago! haha), you have Trine. After that, the three beings as one will seperate into themselves again. So gameplay is you can do local coop, or coop on seperate PCs and can play each of three characters, or if you don't have people to play with you can solo it, like I did. When soloing, you can switch between the three to use their unique abilities and strengths to overcome obstacles in your way. I would imagine it would be more fun and quicker/easier if you had someone or two to play with and they control the other two characters... If you know platform type games like oldschool mario, then I don't need to explain any further as it's similar to that, with added puzzles. If not, then you basically jump and down - killing and or avoiding enemies, solving puzzles, and the screen sidescrolls for you automatically as you progress into the level. Graphics, yeah I thought the original Trine graphics was nice and pretty with everything maxed. Had average fps  of about 67-ish. The physic in this game, which uses nVidia's PhysX system, was awesome! Another one of those rare PhysX games. Audio, well I can say that it actually made full use of my 7.2 surround sound setup - surprised as it's a sidescroller platformer type game which I would have though stereo would be enough, but nope! The atmosphere and music was great! The voice overs were cool too. Sound effects were nice. I believe it must be thanks to the EAX checkbox I ticked....Um not sure what else to say...I liked it enough to give it a thumbs up, though some of the parts are fustrating especially the timing bits and to add skeletons attacking you at the sametime that you have to avoid or and kill off....hah....the last level.....oh god......almost raged but got through it in the end! hahahaha Oh and once you've finished the game, you unlock a harder difficulty, Very Hard - which I'm not even gonna bother with(Hard was fustrating enough for me thanks!)...hahahaha...also there's a new level that unlocks which appears to be similar to the last level of the game.........................................................So yeah....you like solving puzzles? Like a bit of adventure, action too? Do you like them platformer type sidescrolling games as well?

												I seriously LOVE this game. You will, too. Go play it. It's a physics-based puzzle-platformer with combat as well, with collectibles. It seriously has everything. You can alternate at will with three different characters, a knight (good at fighting, has a shileld, can smash things), a thief (ranged weapon, can grapple to things), and a wizard (who can summon boxes, planks and floating platforms). Each level is filled with traps, platforms, undead skeletons summoned around you to attack, and you're constantly switching between characters. Want to kill that far-off archer? Use your thief to shoot it. Surrounded by melee baddies? Use your knight. Need to cross a dangerous pit? Use your wizard to summon things to make a path. There are tons of different ways to play, too. Trying to reach a high up ledge with a collecible on it? You can 1) shoot down the wood planks holding it up (if possible), 2) platform jump some tricky moves, 3) build a tower of blocks or a plank bridge and just walk right over to it, 4) summon something and use it to knock the collectible from the ledge to the ground. There are certain tasks that can only be done with a certain character, or need to be done with a certain character if you haven't upgraded another one sufficiently, but usually there are tons of different ways to brute force a problem.Pros:+Great art. Fantasy setting with lots of giant mushrooms and sparkling fairy plants in woodland settings, creepy dungeons with lava, broken down castles with poisonous goop.+Adjustable difficulty. The default is medium (which is what I played at) and there are sometimes a bunch of baddies swarming on you all at once, but they're usually three weak hits to kill the weak ones, then you start getting better equipped baddies with shield or armor that take more hits. You can play on easy and (I assume) have less baddies or easier to kill ones, or harder if you like a challenge. I'm going to definitely replay on a harder difficulty at some point because this game is truly awesome.+Pretty good music, never setting too serious a tone to fit the style of the game. Baroque fantasy.+MANY ways to solve puzzles, and they're never TOO challenging. Very fun.+Variety of puzzles. Running away from lava, fighting spiders in the dark, low-stress puzzles, complicated platform jumping, etc.+Decent voice acting. Not amazing (except for maybe the thief), but not intrusive or annoying.+XP and leveling. You collect XP through fighting, but also as collectibles. So the more adventurous you are trying to find the hidden ones, the more you level. There's a limited but interesting set of skills to upgrade, making your fighter tougher and making him charge and fling objects at people, and allowing your wizard to summon more objects, making puzzle and platforming easier, and making your thief shoot more arrows, or light things on fire, etc.+Fair checkpoints. Also, if one of your characters dies, you can switch to another. Anytime you want to revive a dead one, just go back to a checkpoint and they return with limited health. This helps A LOT if you really need the wizard for a puzzle but he just got murdered.Cons:-Uh...I'm getting really nitpicky here, because it's just a superbly fun, well-crafted game, but the final boss level has very few checkpoints, but it's the boss so I totally understand.10/10. Will play again. And the sequel.			",44,70,0,5,2,1,6

												Not a bad game, especially if it can be had for cheap.The graphics are good, and (for what it is) the writing is okay-ish. It has a bit of humour, and has personality that many games which cost five times as much would kill for. You can tell a lot of love went into this game.SADLY, it's really janky. The platforming mixed with physics can be really frustrating to play, not because it's difficult, but because it's not very accurate. This can lead to lots of ""miscalcuated"" jumps, and whatnot.Besides that, there's really not much variety to the game, and the core mechanics of switching between Wizard, Thief and Knight to battle and solve physics puzzles really don't cut it after a couple of hours.I'd be hard pushed to recommend this game at £6.99 unless you have a real itch for a physics-based puzzle/action/platformer. But if it's more than 25% off in a sale, go for it!3/5			",351,182,8,50,31,0,46

												Trine ( Updated to Enchanced Edition BETA )Trine (EE) was a game that I set out to play long ago, but was distracted with blockbuster titles, which, I must add, I highly regret. I've ( personally ) had an amazing time playing Trine (EE), it so simplistic, yet it keeps your braining going. The vibrant colors and the care for detail was perfect ( kudos to the devs ). Trine (EE) is a must get for everyone, the control scheme ( I used a Microsoft Remote ) worked extremely smoothly, I found no bugs while playing the entire game! I highly recommend this game to everyone, whether it be for the level designs or gameplay style, everyone will enjoy this game. I must add, it is a great game to pull yourself into when tired of the standard RPG or FPS. Give this game a try and I promise, you will not regret it!!10/10			",310,67,6,47,23,8,37

												Trine is an extremely unique platformer requiring the use of all three of the characters to complete levels. The game is rather straight forward and simple once you get the hang of the character switch and their respective ablities. It can be made much more interesting when playing on Very Hard difficulty and attempting all the acheivements, which I highly recommend. The level design and art is absolutely beautiful, and if nothing else play the game just for that. It isn't too time consuming, and 100% took less then 15 hours. Overall enjoyable, and absolutely gorgeous.			",125,11,6,17,17,2,15

												This game is about a Wizard, a Thief and a Knight who's souls stuck together by a mysterious stone. Now our heroes will search for the Trine to be free again.In this game, you will be controlling one character who can transfer into another character whenever you want! you can switch between Magic (wizard), Fast movement (Thief) and the Tank (Knight) in-combat. This game is 2D but has insanly great 3D graphics wich are very fun to watch. As the Wizard, you can create blocks, brightes and flying platforms wich will help him in the battle / moving distances, the Thief weilds a bow and a hook that can help her jump above spikes / other dangerous things, with the bow she can kill enemies easly from a distance. The Knight has a sword and a shield, with the shield he can block attacks from monsters / spike balls, witht he sword he could do a very high DPS.Pros:1. The game is 2D but it's 3D (lol) that means the game is 3D but you can only move < ^ > with the character.2. The soundtrack is great and looks perfectly with the game's story / graphics.3. Combat system is very fun, imagine yourself knocking your enemy with the Knight and switching to the Thief to finish the enemy.4. Character switching. You can easly change your character from the Wizard, to the Thief or to the Knight with 3 buttons: 1 , 2 , 3. You can do it in mid-air, you can do it while running... you can do it whenever you want.Cons:1. The game is too short D: . After 8 hours of playing it, the game still looks short. Well it looks short for me :).Graphics: 10/10.Combat: 10/10.Story: 8/10.I'd give this game a metascore of 90+/100.  ",202,29,11,15,12,3,10

												Trine proves that if you have an original mix of ideas, even old school gameplay can still work great, especially when paired with incredible visuals and extremely polished code. So, it is a bit short and lacks long-term replayability and gets scored accordingly, but don't let that stop you - Trine is definitely something special.			",135,25,6,21,4,3,20

The effects from the hammer attacks looks godly and the different maps are very short, but I like them more. Enemies looks like poop, but I did enjoy this game more than the second one (which also is awesome).Nothing negative to say, just miss some things that you can do from Trine 2, but regardless of that, I think this game is worth every penny. Even at full price. Very short game though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Actually I played Trine 2 first but wanted to finish this one fast. So when I compare it to 2, the 2nd one is soooo much better. The battle was kinda pointless, since you always revive at the save point, mana kinda pointless, skill system useless,  and the puzzle too easy. With the wizard you got the god mode to nearly make anything happen. It still was fun to play it, but since I played 2 first, it was unfair to compare it with trine 2. But the graphic looks awesome and the dialoge were kinda funny.			",213,66,3,40,7,1,26

												A True Masterpiece!This game has everything you need.It's really fun to play!The game itself is a stimulating platform game, with puzzles and enemies, in which you alternate between 3 very different characters, each one with his own abilities.The game is not too hard, but not too easy either...i'd say it's well balanced.Longevity is also satisfying, with a good amount of levels.The graphics are gorgeous, with a lot of depth into the scenaries, and the level design proves to be one of the best ever, even today; It takes a different approach towards the classic medieval theme, concentratic more on the magical and colorful ""fable-like"" flavour rather than the dark gritty one (more popular in other games).The music is something you can easily label as MAGNIFICENT, PERFECT, MERVELOUS!One of the best soundtrack i have ever listened to...you'll surely end up listening to it long after finishing the game.A very good product! :)			",190,37,8,17,12,1,22

												First word that comes to mind when I think about this game is... Beautiful! The graphics in this game are trully outstanding. The setting takes place in a magical world, and visuals transport the player right into it. Apart from this, the gameplay is very original, and although it takes a little while to get used to, once you get into the game it can be a true godsend :) I would class this game as a casual action / puzzle / platformer. It is an easy-to-play kind of game, during which you can just relax and enjoy the scenery. This may be a downside to those who enjoy a challenge (especially when it comes to enemies, as these don't really get any harder throughout the game), but overall it is an utterly enjoyable experience.There is also a lot of storyline which is definitely worth following.

												Trine!! Such a great idea and also well implemented... what else can you ask for? This is one of those games that are kind of special to me, along with its sequel Trine 2. Athough the game was launched in 2009, the developers updated the game not long ago with a lot of new stuff. I never really paid too much attention to the story of the game, but that's just because the game is so fun that I was always eager to get started. The gameplay mechanics are great, I love how each character does different things and serves a different role within the group. In fact, I'd recommend playing this game with your significant other/housecarl. This is one of those great co-op games, definitely perfect for a couple or maybe even some friends... so long as there are just 3 of you! It is true that the game is not hard at all, with the exception of the last stages,  but even on easy it'll take you some time to find everything in the game and discover all its secrets. I just managed to get all the achievements and it took me about 15 hours, but I'd say the main game would take you about 6 or 7 hours. Definitely more if you replay some of the stages, or if you like to go treasure hunting like me!  Oh, and in case none of your friends have the game but you still want to collaborate with other people while playing, remember that Trine also has an online mode. Besides all this, the game is in a lot of different languages and the dubbing is also very good in all the versions I've heard so far. I'd mention its cons, but I simply don't see any. Don't think about it too much, just choose the knight, the thief or the wizard and find that elusive Trine before it's too late!			",294,108,1,50,22,3,48

The controls are easy and quick and the gameplay fast. You will use the abilities of the three heroes to their fullest to complete this game.IMHO: 9/10			",165,79,1,15,31,0,7

												Good game... well worth the low price.Word of warning for Macbook Air owners who're thinking about taking a chance on it... the game did run on the lowest setting on my mid 2013 MBA (4GB RAM, Intel HD 5000, 1.3GHz i5 with Turboboost) but the fan was up to max speed in 5 mins and the CPU temp was up to 98ºC. You wouldn't want to run your MBA at that temp for very long!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of puzzle solving games, like smashing the hell out of skeletons and if you like the idea of having 3 characters merged into 1.Firstly, I got this in a package in the Christmas sale and didn't think I was going to play it. I installed it due to it's small file size and thought ""Meh, let's see what this is like."" I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while. For a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.8/10			",111,5,0,13,10,1,17

												One of the better indie titles out there, unforuntunately limited by somewhat questionable game design.While the levels and puzzles are gloriously thought out and realised, it's all built around how the developers intended the game to be played: with 3 people controlling each of the characters.This is important, because along with this assumption, the developers neglected to include online play, and made it local only. This meant the vast majority of people played it as a singleplayer game.And what happens in singleplayer? You ninja through the levels as the theif, bypassing many of the more challenging and enjoyable puzzles the game has to offer.Glorious graphics and co-operative design, but unless you have two others that are going to be playing with you, in the same room, with controllers (I mean really?), then you aren't really playing it as it should be played.Thankfully this was remedied in the second game.

												Beautiful puzzle platformer which I enjoyed very much. I would definitely recommend this game to all gamers (young and old). It is nice trip in fairy tales land.Sadly there is no option for lan co-op play, but luckily Trine 2 is option for you, if you are seeking that kind of entertainment with your gaming buddy.

												This game is absolutely gorgeous. The graphics are amazing, but aside from that, the gameplay, which is what really matters is superb. You feel like you are in a book as a narrator dictates a story of how 3 very different people with unique abilities find an object and are sent on an adventure. You must develop strategies to get across difficult levels as some characters are more useful than others in some places. The gameplay is unforgettable and is appropriate for all ages, as I let my little sister play, who loves it.9.5/10Get it while it is 99 cents, you won't regret your decision....Also get Trine 2 while its on sale if you like this one			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Actually I have been playing Trine 2 before the first episode. That was the reason I had great expectations, but sadly Trine offers lower quality in every aspect. Oh, okay not sadly, because that means the sequel is better. I was playing this title in couch co-op mode, and we had great 18 hours of enjoyment. Both 1 and 2 have a demo so try them and get the Complete Story if you like it. I did so, and did not regret it. My daughter neither.			",122,28,3,18,8,1,19

												This game is very fun and simple. You get to play as three players (in singleplayer) which you get to constantly switch between at any time with no restrictions, making the game somewhat easy. All you have to do is kill monsters, solve puzzles, beat levels, and finish with a challenge in a final tower. This game is set on a 2D platform. In my opinion, the story is too short for the regular price. If you do a medium run (stop usually to collect extra experience and find secrets), then this game will last you about 5-6 hours. Long runs (stop more frequently and stop to look at the backgrounds) 7-8 hours; short runs (speedruns) 2-4 hours. I would recommend buying this game when it is on sale, especially in a collection (Trinelogy or Frozenbyte Collection 2016). If the beautiful backgrounds attracted you (like me) then definetly get this game. Trust me, you won't regret it. In summary, a good game when it is on sale. This game has some of the best level artwork of all the games on Steam.			",33,5,0,3,1,0,1

												Trine is an excellent puzzle-platformer, game mechanics is interesting, level design is great, graphics and music are outstanding. There are 15 levels plus one as a present from the developers. One level can take up to an hour, if you want to fully explore it. Trine is not so easy by the way, I bet you can't find all the secrets and experience on first playthrough. So it has high replay value, you can play it once to finish the game, then the second time to get all the achievements and there's always the hard mode.			",622,166,28,85,60,6,114

												Trine was absolutely spectacular. I usually do not enjoy many platformer games, but in this case, I was pleasantly surprised. The visual aspect of the game is just gorgeous. The lighting really does make it feel 'enchanted' (enchanted edition). However, this alone is not what makes this game spectacular. It is the fact that there are so many creative ways in which you can complete puzzles and get about and around in the game that made me stick around. You play as 3 people whose souls are stuck in the Trine. If you play alone, then you have to switch out between the Wizard, the Thief, and the Warrior. Each character has different special abilities, giving you the opporunity to solve the same puzzles in so many different ways. As a gamer, it really makes you feel creative when you solve a difficult puzzle/climb a difficult part of a level in your own unique way. It is all up to you in how you will get around in the game, whether it be using the Thief's grappling hook or the wizard's floating platform (etc). This game is amazing because there are no limits and no standards to how you solve a puzzle/level. It is all up to your imagination :). This is definitely worth playing!			",170,71,1,17,14,0,8

												I love this game. Fun, beautiful and has a nice story.The original Trine was fun and pretty but some levels needed to maybe have been thought out a bit more but this enchanted version corrects that and makes the graphics even more beautiful.I now played the game from start to finish 18 times and started another game. I have also completed every achievement that the game has and had fun doing so.The only real negatives are a slight lack of variety in enemies and I still don't like the last level.Other than that the positives are:1. Beautiful graphics2. Fun3. Nice story4. Great puzzles5. I love the skill system.I love this game so much I have 2 copies of it. One from GOG and one on Steam for the achievements.Would highly recommend. 10/10P.S: Also the first platform game I finished and enjoyed.I also 100% completed every single achievement and had fun doing so. I love this game a lot. Even though my save profile got messed up by Steam cloud I still will replay the game again and get all the experience again.Wonderful game.			",57,19,0,10,7,0,35

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Platform fighting game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are Subtitles that you are able to Toggle.The game is fully voiced over.You are able to turn the audio voice off.There is a brightness thing but i don't think this is needed unless you want to tune it down.You are able to play this with a xbox controller.Able to toggle ""Tooltips""You are able to toggle ""FPS cap"" and choose your own cap number.You are able to change your keyboard or Xbox controller controls. You are able to make multiple save slots to CONTROL CHANGES.You are able to turn on the xbox controller vibration :D :)You are able to change the mouse and xbox controller sensitivity speed.There is a Master volume.There is a Sound and speech volume.There is a Music Volume.About the game.You play with 3 different characters but only one at at time. You are able to switch from characters at any time you want. Each character has their own power. There is a Mage, Archer and a Warrior. The game has amazing graphics a decent storyline. Game however could be a little bit repetitive, because mostly the thing that you are doing is, Moving and fighting.  The game is from the side. So that means you are only able to move left or right.  From time to time you will see a checkpoint which will also heal and revive dead allies. Sadly the game has collectables. The game has some kind of Perk/level up system.Mage: Is able to create objects and move objects with magical powers, which is really useful to go to some area's that arent possible to reach without it. You can summon wooden planks and squares for an example. You are able to use your magical power to move some of the objects to build bridges with or you can throw them hurt enemies. Some of the collectables are very easy to obtain with this ""Summon"" ability.Archer: Is able to shoot a grappling hook into wooden objects, so that you are able to swing around and move to new area's or avoid dangerous platforms. You are able to shoot more then 1 arrow if you are going to upgrade the skill or even turn your arrows into fire. This character is usually used to move around fast throughout levels.Warrior:  Is able to use the shield to defend and block the incoming damage. Has a sword that is upgradeable to do more damage. You are able to charge into enemies and push them back with a big knockback and you are also able throw and move objects with your shield. Some area's could be difficult to reach with this guy but he is mainly a fighter character anyway.Game is casual and calming.Has interesting storyline.You are able to play multiplayer.Music is very good.Graphics is fine but some area's could be hurtful.Graphics is colorful.There are collectables :(Other things.Colors COULD hurt your eyes.I HATE COLLECTABLES.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10 ",467,171,6,45,49,1,62

												Quick Summary: Side scrolling platformer with great graphics and some tricky (but not too tricky) puzzle solving and light combat. Great game for casual co-op as well.You play a trio of heroes trapped in a single body by a mysterious magical artifact called the Trine. While your souls are bound, you can be any one of the three characters at any time: Wizard, Thief, or Knight. Your quest is to find out why you’re bound together and how to undo the “curse.” The game is played with keyboard and mouse though other players can drop in using a game controller on the same computer. You progress mostly from left to right in a two dimensional plane with a lot of jumping and scrambling from one level to another. With a press of a button you can instantly switch between the three characters, each with their unique skills useful for fighting (knight) grappling (thief) or conjuring objects to use (wizard). Each of the characters has their own life bar so if they die you need to either make do with the other 2 characters or backtrack until you get to a checkpoint (a glowing sphere). You can backtrack as much as you want in this game, which is useful since there are a lot of collectibles to be found. The collectibles mainly come in the form of experience potions, and when you level up you can upgrade skills unique to each character class (for example increasing the number of objects the wizard can have conjured at any one time).Pros:+Amazing graphics for a little indie game. The environments look 3D despite being a simple side scroller.+Free upgrade to the Enchanted Edition. The upgraded version uses the Trine 2 engine and got a large number of new Steam achievements.+Nice story with good narration. The narrator appears as an announcer in Dota 2 so you may recognize his voice.Cons: Not much really, the game is awesome.This is a great, cheap game that anyone can get into. If you didn’t get it for free sometime in the past you can probably see it in Humble Bundles occasionally. Play with friends and family! ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

												This is good game for players who want to play puzzle-platformer games. Levels are sometimes very challenging  but sometimes easy, too. Game story is interesting and enemies aren't too difficult, actually too easy. Too little bosses, but nevermind. Especially final boss & level is very changelling, so the end of this game is the best.Backgrounds of the levels are beautiful and finely done. Graphics are good. Characters of this game are Mage (Amadeus), Thief (Zoya) and Knight (Pontius). They all have their own talents and weakness. That makes game more interesting.Nice game, worth to buy, but maybe it's better to buy this with 50%-75% discount because this isn't very long game.4/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played first the Trine 2 game, which was amazing and stunning with beautiful graphics and the best music i have ever heard in a game! Now i decided to play the Trine 1 enchanted edition, which i was sceptical about it, because it is older than the first trine i played.. But i have to admit that it worths every moment i spent on it.The atmosphere is cool and the music is sth else!! Ithe graphics isnt as cool as the trine 2, but i like them !The only thing that is makes me feal a bit strange is the controls, feels a bit sloppy to me but it is not that bad, but Trine 2 is superior in controling matters!But even though the sloppy controls i loved this game, i have to finish it to complete my experience with the series!! Guys you have to give it a try, but please it is better to play it after trine 2, trust me , you ll more things to understand and love in the game!! so its an 8/10 from me			",200,51,11,19,11,0,31

												I've bought this game to play with my friends and by some reason we were only able to play it on Saturdays.On any other day one of us just couldn't connect to the server and his ping went straight to 30 thousand.At these moments I ignored all sadness, went to main menu, picked Zoya and flew around the screen.At these moments I could feel wind blowing towards my face. At these moments I was free...On Saturdays thought we were able to play. But... Killing skeletons, collecting experience, upgrading skills, solving puzzles, looking at pretty graphics, listening to wonderful soundtracks, spending time with friends - it's all was so lame. Uh.Still, love this game for those Main menu moments.10/10 Would fly as Zoya in Main Menu again.			",117,36,0,16,3,0,0

												More of a puzzle game with light combat aspects that revolves around you cycling between three different playstyles to progress throughout the level. It took me 9 hours to complete and I pretty much just stayed on as the thief throughout most of the game. It kind of seemed like the warrior and the mage were useless unless you specifically needed them for a part of the puzzle or some heavy combat. The game was still a fairly good game but is lacking in content and the story isn't all that great. The mechanics are unique though and it was an enjoyable game for a playthrough, try to get it on sale.3/5Fun game but not worth $15 due to it's lacking content. The mechanics are unique but you end up playing mnost of the game on a single character instead of switching between them let they designed it to be. Kinda easy also, casual gameplay.

												You remember years ago, when you used to sit down for an hour or two and play a videogame? After school and before dinner, kicking off your shoes and curling up with Crash or Ratchet until the TV went off and the food was done? Not a 6 hour binge or a 12 hour marathon session, but just a wind-down and chill out session of zen gaming? Well if you need to be remended then I highly recommend Trine. This gorgeous plateformer delivers level after stunning level of puzzle-platform fun in a relatively short but action packed package. I played through with an xbox360 controller and was pleasantly reminded of the console platformers I grew up on.  All in all a game well worth your time and dollar. Others have fairly reviewed in more detail, see those reviews for pros and cons.

												One of the most beautiful platform games ever. The controls are easy to use and the online co-op is awesome. Some of the mages boxes glitch around but other then that I had no problems. Although, there seems to be a bug with the in-game voice when playing with more then one player. The voice auto turns on at the start of each level. If you are using Skype then it can be annoying, because you have to switch it off all the time. If you are not using an external communication program then it should be fine, unless you really don't want to talk. I love the Trine games, they are all enjoyable and have a replayability factor.

												On hell of a fun game.The graphics are lovely,the puzzles are like how the puzzles in HL2 are fluid but some a bit more challenging. Plenty of side scroller action. If you want to play through the story and enjoy the combat this game will not let you down. Id even recommend buying  the Trine bundle which comes with Trine 1 + Trine 2 complete. However I will say the gameplay mechanics are the same between the two with Trine 2 have more color to its graphics and having co-op. If you are a fan of side scrolling action, with a light touch of rpg elements this game will not let you down. It has controller support but I find keyboard + mouse to be much more enjoyable to use.Bottom Line: Worth gtting if you want to play the story of the characters from their beginning.Now with its enhanced edition it comes with the Trine 2 graphics and co-op.

												This game is very fun and simple. You get to play as three players (in singleplayer) which you get to constantly switch between at any time with no restrictions, making the game somewhat easy. All you have to do is kill monsters, solve puzzles, beat levels, and finish with a challenge in a final tower. This game is set on a 2D platform. In my opinion, the story is too short for the regular price. If you do a medium run (stop usually to collect extra experience and find secrets), then this game will last you about 5-6 hours. Long runs (stop more frequently and stop to look at the backgrounds) 7-8 hours; short runs (speedruns) 2-4 hours. I would recommend buying this game when it is on sale, especially in a collection (Trinelogy or Frozenbyte Collection 2016). If the beautiful backgrounds attracted you (like me) then definetly get this game. Trust me, you won't regret it. In summary, a good game when it is on sale.

												Trine is a superb game to look at - quite possibly the most graphically lush side-scroller I've yet come across. With twin 4890's onboard in Crossfire, this game pretty much ramps up the cooling fans straight away - it's that demanding with the eye candy turned on.Trine is effectively a thinking man's hack 'n slash, mixed in with a bit of puzzle solving. The three main characters in the game - a wizard, thief and knight become 'fused' together allowing you pick the relevant character for the task at hand. Along the way experience is picked up which you can apply to one of the three characters as you see fit. The only gripe I've yet comes across wih the game is the absurdly large gap between checkpoint saves - which can see you redoing literally several minutes of a stage if all three characters die.Aside from that, I'd highly recommend Trine as an enjoyable, beautiful and quite cerebral game. 8/10.

												Trine is a good game, I mostly enjoyed it and I think my critisisms are just based on me not being a huge fan of platformers. You control three characters, switching between them at will. The wizard conjures objects to help you move around, the knight is for melee attacks, and the thief can use her bow to swing over gaps and attack from range. The fun part is figuring out how to combine these abilities to progress. At times the physics can be a little fiddly, not doing quite what you were hoping for, but its not a huge problem. Most areas have multiple solutions so the player shouldn't be stuck for long. I found the combat to be a bit tedious, as most enemies respawn about five times before finally staying dead. It feels like unnecessary padding. Level design is colourful and the story and voice acting are decent. I didn't suffer any bugs or crashes. Trine lasts around 6 hours, and there's not much scope for replayability, but the purchase price is cheap so value for money is good.			",144,30,0,15,8,2,16

												Trine, this game has received positive feedback in general, and to be honest, it is well deserved. It is probably the best side scrolling RPG I've ever played and one of the greatest side scrollers ever played. The gameplay itself is a combination of physics/platforming and combat. You switch between one of the three classes to deal with obtacles and progress in the game. The story itself is good, with a pretty intriguing story and cast of characters, the dialogue is good for a couple laughs here and there, making an overall enjoyable experience. With the prices this game has had, there is no excuse not to own this amazing game, its a purchase you won't regret.			",631,155,16,70,57,4,101

Apparently co-op is the saving grace for this title, but alas I get little opportunity for that. If you DO, however, then get this game or its sequel. It's excellent.			",159,25,3,22,1,0,3

												This is truly one of the best 2D platformers I have ever played! With fantastic visuals, nice storytelling, music that makes you feel that you are in your dream fantasy world and fantastic narrator. Recommended for anyone who enjoys the platforms, puzzles and medieval times.			",141,11,0,16,0,0,3

												PROS+ Graphics/VisualsThe graphics in Trine are colorful and enveloped in a vibrant bloom, creating a magical and dream-like ambiance. The beauty is even more apparent when playing at 4K resolution or downsampled from such. + MusicThe music is pleasant and fits nicely with the visual style; also pizzicato strings rule. CONS- Faulty ControlsIronically, controls are wonky considering platforming is a core mechanic of the game. One of my problems was, for example, turning around on a dime and then jumping onto a platform; this often resulted in not grasping onto a ledge and falling, making fast platforming difficult. It was often more practical to give yourself extra space, turn around, wait for a second, and then attempt a jump. If this issue sounds strange, trust me, you would know what I am talking about if you played for yourself. Something else I noticed was that tapping the jump key as oppose to a longer press would cover a shorter distance. As a consequence, if you had to jump multiple platforms in quick succession, you would often fail and have to repeat, making for irksome moments. Finally, the character would at many times fail to grasp onto to a ledge despite clearly being able to do so; once again, leading to frustration. - Basic CombatThere is nothing special about the combat in Trine; it is quite shallow with no outstanding features. The one character, Amadeus, is next to useless for combat because he has no proper attack. You have to summon a cube, levitate it above an enemy, and let it fall crushing him. Attacking like this is fun at first but gets old, and is far too slow especially when dealing with several foes. With Amadeus being incompetent, only the other two characters are practical for fighting.- Underwhelming and Skippable PuzzlesPuzzles were not impressive since none really stood out to me. Making matters worse, are the character abilities which make many portions of the game skippable. A prime example would be conjuring Amadeus' triangle block and then using Zoya's grapple to transverse over an area in a way not intended. Even Amadeus alone is a problem since you can summon several blocks and planks to advance effortlessly. You could avoid upgrading Amadeus fully, but self-imposed limitations are never fun.- Repetitive GameplayTrine's gameplay is repetitious due to the reuse of content throughout the game. Not much changes in regards to combat, platforming, and puzzles, thus being a bit of a bore to play.- Difficulty CurveMost of the playthrough is far too easy, even on hard; however, once reaching the final level, the difficulty suddenly spikes. In this last level, you have to rush intensifying previously mentioned problems leading one to curse out loud. The difficulty curve which stagnates for the most part and then suddenly shoots up hurts this title big time.CONCLUSIONThe visuals and music of Trine are charming but do little for the overall experience. The combination of core mechanics is admittedly interesting but unfortunately dissonant to the extent of fundamentally breaking gameplay. Then there are other issues adding further insult to injury; I can not recommend this game. Ultimately, I give Trine a PAR of 1.IMPORTANT: I use PARS instead of a standard 1-10 scale.

												I would recommend this game. You are switching between 3 main characters, a wizard (who I have named Harry), a theif and a knight. Each of the characters have their own abilites (a bow, magic ect) which can advance as the game goes on. The setting and people looks realistic, but it is not a graphic game. Overall, I would recommend Trine to anybody with a sense of adventure.			",10,2,0,1,1,1,5

												   Ok let me start by saying any criticism aside, that I straight up loved this game and look forward to playing the next 2. However there are some pros and cons to the beautiful Trine: Enchanted Edition. As just mentioned this games design and beauty is what immediately drew me in and is what compelled me to buy the trilogy on steam and give it a run.   Trine is a platformer that uses three main characters who you are able to swap between to complete different tasks in the level. The Mage who can summon different items that become very useful, the Thief who is the archer of the group, & the Warrior who can take on foes face to face.   The flaws in Trine are minimal but almost all have to do with AI. The enemies wander into their own demise quite often, which doesn’t take you out of the game experience quite as much as when the bosses stomp right off the cliff. This usually happens when he is chasing you and your character falls off the cliff as well, but when you swap characters or respawn the boss is still gone which leads to some overly simplistic battles.   The story in Trine is kind of throw away, and serves more as a loading screen filler than anything. For this kind of game though that is actually a pretty good fit & did not leave me wanting more narrative. There is a narrator who explains the heroes plight and what they are about to delve into before each level.   So as you can imagine, the enemies and bosses killing themselves of can make for some pretty easy levels. I flew through the regular levels with relatively no problem, but when you come to the last level prepare to strap yourself in for a doozy. No matter how far you get, unless you reach the one check point at the very top, you will be sent straight back to the beginning over and over. This type of push back on the last level always endears a game to me I think the completion of a game should be a challenge and in that area Trine delivers.    My experience with the first of the Trine trilogy most definitely has me looking forward to the other two, & with the company partnering with GameStop for publishing on a new project, now is a good time to dig into the games if you haven’t already.For more video game news & reviews be sure to follow the blogHttp://www.SublimeGameReviews.wordpress.com & follow on instagram & twitter @SublimeReviews			",228,133,7,33,40,2,19

												Trine is a unique blend of 3 classes, puzzles and physics-based adventures. The game itself plays out very nicely, the Enchanted Edition allows for more visually stunning graphics and you can easily lose track of time completing levels and killing skeletons. Can't wait to play the second one!+ 3 different characters/mechanics+ 3 unique abilities+ Filled with puzzle elements packed with several solutions+ Often requires rethinking your strategy+ Best fun I've had in a game in local Co-Op mode!+ Lots of Achievements+ Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)-  Some levels can be really frustrating- Different controllers are set up differentlyPersonal Ranking: 7.5/10 ",468,210,14,42,30,6,43

												I personally like new twists on old classics, so I look for influences of good oldies in newer games. So when I was first introduced to “Trine”, I was all like: here are new “The Lost Vikings” (by Blizzard, 1992): three characters, each one with his strength and weaknesses complementing each other and solving little puzzles to complete levels.“Trine” is not, of course a copy of “Vikings”: it is more of an action, the puzzles are a bit easier, characters transform to each other, not being present on screen simultaneously (much like Silmarils’ “Metal Mutant” of 1991). Of course game looks much and much better, the world is designed beautifully,Game’s characters get experience from killing monsters and finding secrets, which can also contain unique items. Level-ups make them stronger in combat and platforming.So if you are into mildly difficult puzzle-platformers with a bit of RPG elements, you should check this one out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Odlična igra!Sve pohvale za igru i njene kreatore. Stvarno su se potrudili da igra u svakom elemetnu bude zanimljiva i prijatna za igranje.Trine je 2D igra sa zanimljivom pričom koja će Vas naterati da se osećate kao da ste u nekoj bajci, a pomoć celom doživljaju daje i neverovatan glas naratora koji Vas vodi kroz celu ovo avanturu. Na to se nadovezuje predivna grafika sa puno boja i detalja, lepo osmišljeni likovi sa jedinstvenim umećem i na sve to (kao da ovo prethodno nije dovoljno) prijatna i opuštajuća muzika koja Vas prati tokom cele igre i upotpunjuje ceo doživljaj.Sama igra se svodi na to da upravljate sa tri ličnosti i rešavate zadatke koji su pred Vama, pritom skupljajući iskustvo kako bi unapredili vaše ličnosti. U skladu sa zadatim problemom birate koja će ličnost, na osnovu svojih mogućnosti, biti najbolja za rešavanje problema. Kako se igra bude bližila kraju biće Vam potreban zajednički rad dve ili sve tri ličnosti da rešite određeni problem. Naravno ovo je samo ukratko, igra Vam pruža mnogo više.Bilo bi stvarno velika šteta da propustite da probate igru koja je sa ovoliko pažnje i detalja urađenja, koja ne traži zver od računara, gde se na svaki detalj, i onaj najmanji, mislilo.Još jednom, sve pohvale i velika preporuka svima da probaju ovu neverovatnu igru.

Short version: 91%Trine is an enchanting old-school platformer with three unique main characters and excellent level design. It suffers from some difficulty issues, especially in the end, yet those can be easily forgiven when you get yourself lost in the immersive visuals.Long version:Indie platformers on PC are far from being rare, but seldom do we see a gem like Trine. The largest selling point of the game is the breathtaking visual style and carefully constructed, detail-rich levels. The backgrounds are just teeming with and movement, making you feel you are playing in a living 3D environment, even though the gameplay itself is limited to 2D.The game itself is a very traditional platformer, where the levels require agility and a bit of resilience to get through. You also get three characters with distinctive abilities, but they all seem to lack personality. Although the original design suggests that all three are needed to clear the levels, in reality most stages are beatable by using mostly, or only the Thief. Despite this shortcoming, the level design is fun, and gathering all the (optional) experience can be a challenging, but not impossible task.The only part where the game falls short– like most platformers– is the story, which really boils down to: “Evil wizard is evil, go kill.” Still, the narration is pleasant and the banter among the three reluctant heroes is entertaining enough to keep you interested in the simple plot line.You can also switch to the Enchanted edition in the Betas tab, where the engine is replaced by the sequel’s, but even though I can run Trine 2 with no problems, the Enchanted edition suffered massive frame drops for me, so I can’t judge the upgrade.

												Trine is basically The Lost Vikings as a physics-based puzzle platformer, offering three characters with very different skillsets and many ways you can use them to approach the game's puzzles and challenges. It's not terribly hard unless you play it on the hardest difficulties, mostly due to offering infinite lives and copious checkpoints, but it always feels like a fun adventure and doesn't lack for challenge, even if you'll be able to respawn until you complete it eventually.Plus it's got an amusing sense of humor and a solid artstyle, and with the Enchanted Edition upgrade, online multiplayer for when you want to help (or screw over) your friends through the levels. It's hard to not recommend Trine to anyone who's interested in puzzle platformers at all.			",923,363,8,393,62,1,217

												Truly one of the most impressive games I've ever played. The art alone is worth buying this, but the game is actually really fun and well done also. As for the art, it's not just the drawings/models/textures, but the animation is pure genius as well. Every moving thing in the game is done with absolute perfection, and even though it's sort of a ""2d platformer"" as for genre, everything is done in 3D with great precision. Just the way the warrior blocks with his shield clearly has sooo much time and thought put into perfecting the action. And everything else is done with just as much care. I don't have as much detail to say about them, but the music and sound effects are just as great as the visual effects, and clearly just as well-perfected. The physics are absolutely perfect, again done with absolute precision and perfection, with almost real life precision and realism. I'm on I think the 5th level, and there isn't a *ton* of combat, but there's just enough and it's well done like everything else. The game is probably a bit more puzzle-platformer than action(so far.. and I should say there's plenty of platform jumping, swinging, and hand/eye coordination stuff.. you just aren't constantly fighting enemies the entire time too), but the puzzles are great.. not unrealistically impossible, but they require some thought and dexterity and they continue to get more challenging the further you go. In every aspect, this is one of my most satisfying purchases. And by the way, if you try the demo and like the concept, but aren't sure if there's enough to it, you gain more abilities and everything gets SO much cooler as you get further in. The wizard can create more boxes and also platforms(and there's still 4 more ability slots I don't know what they do... that's 4 for EACH character, and I think 5 more for the thief), the warrior gets a charge ability(and 3 or 4 more I don't have yet) and you get various special items for even more abilities, customization, and bonuses.

												Trine caught my attention cause I love platform games.  This one took me by surprise.  The attractive graphics, smooth animation, and the interesting differences between characters make this game a must play.  Now with enhanced graphics using the Trine 2 engine, this game only got better.  There are some downfalls to this game such as the fact that you fight only against skeletons and then a dismal amount of bosses makes it too repetitive.  Other than that, it's a great game that you can't miss.  Frozenbyte, the creators of the Shadowground series, has definitely put their name on the map with Trine.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												Thoroughly disappointed after seeing the reviews. I expected a charming character driven experience but instead found minimal characterisation, story and dialogue, repetitive boss fights (there are seriously only two repeated throughout the game) and bland enemies (of which there are four), easily solvable physics ""puzzles"" and a deeply disappointing ending and final level. The environment design looks nice even if some assets are repeated but that is not enough to make this game enjoyable, replayable or even recommendable.			",74,12,0,23,10,0,12

												A beatiful game, to play with friends or alone. Trine seems inspired by the classic Blizzard game The Lost Vikings. Like said game, Trine is puzzle platformer in which you switch from 3 characters with unique combat and traversal skills in order to overcome many challenges. Recently Trine was updated with the engine of the sequel but you can still select which version to play when you start the game.			",463,237,16,78,53,5,84

												Trine is a fun 2D platformer with puzzle elements. The only problem I have with it, is that it is way too easy. There is no penalty for dying besides going back to a checkpoint and even then, enemies don't respawn. I do like this better than the sequel though. There is more gameplay and less story than Trine 2, which I prefer. If you want to play a fun game that does not take itself seriously, I would recommend it. Not a amazing game, but still good.

												Here's three reasons why Trine is not like other platforming games I've played before:-Characters:I usually could care less about a platforming games character, but in Trine the balance of the three characters and their unique personalities via great voice acting and unique abiliites.-Story:Most platforming games like Mario or Super Meatboy or Shank, etc etc, I couldn't even remotely tell you what the overall story was about, but Trine kept you hooked from the very start of the game and makes you develop a vested interest in how the story moves along-Artwork:most platforming games these days are trying to do a bit better in the artwork department  and the overall artwork presentation of platforming games has progressed very well in the last few years with the advent of indie games, but Trine's artwork is best described in two words:VISUALLY STUNNING!A Lack of online co-op is the only thing holding this back from being a $5 masterpiece.

												Trine is basically a platformer with some minor puzzle elements. You will be jumping around on said platforms quite a lot, but instead of having just one character, you have three, which you can change on the fly (unless one or more of them died) and also has his own set of skills. The mage can conjure crates, planks and a floaty triangle thingies, the thief has a grappling hook and a bow and the knight is best suited for combat, but the thief is pretty much the best class, mostly because of her grappling hook, which you will most likely use extensively. It's also great to just circumvent the few ""puzzles"" you get in the game.Her bow is also a great weapon, even in close combat, unless you are overwhelmed by enemies.And now let's talk about those enemies, shall we?Skeletons. Tons of 'em. Not running around in the levels, no, they're spawning. Again and again. And that is nothing more than annoying and certainly not fun. Sometimes I've felt like in Call of Duty, when you aren't moving forwards and enemies just keep spawning and spawning...You will also encounter bats from time to time, which are also quite annoying, but at least they're not as common as those skeletons...All in all a good and quite nice looking game with some annoyances here and there.

												A fun game, with minor RPG elements, wonderful art style and visuals , albeit slightly repetitive gameplay and lack of character depth.The first thing about this game is the amazing visuals. It is a pleasure to play simply to look at the environment. The detail to the characters, spells, enemies and background art is great. The voiceover of the characters is also very well done. All in all, the production and art, design elements are top notch.The gameplay mechanics are well done - but the areas that could have been improved are the RPG elements. The gear and skills for each character are fairly irrelevant. It doesn't seem to be much of a stretch to say you could ignore all the gear and all the skills and finish the game without notice that you didn't use anything. They are merely small accents to your character - which is cool - but feels like it could have been developed more to make each character even more specialized and the party dynamic more rich.  As it stood, I used the fighter all the time and only switched to the mage when I needed a box and the thief when I needed to swing (and maybe at least half the time I could just make boxes to achieve the same ends).  This wasn't enough to detract from the fun of the game - it just had me thinking there was a lot of character overlap or lack of puzzle diversity to properly utilize each character more.Leading to the ""puzzles"" - each level, each map was essentially always the same type. Eventually you get slightly different obstacles such as spinning boards, button pushing, but most of the time it was ""jump, make a box, jump, make a box, (maybe swing)"".  More diversity in this area would have enhanced things. Same with the story. I don't put much weight into the story, but it could have also been a lot more interesting than it ultimately turns out to me. It was only 10 hours in length for me, and I don't play very fast, so expect others could go through even faster.With that said, it was still a very fun game. Recommended if on sale for sure.  I have bought the 2nd game (as a testament to the enjoyment of the first) and hope some of the things above are more fleshed out making it really what it could be. Then if things go well, onto the 3rd installment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.			",187,30,6,20,14,2,39

(For a children's game.)The combat is actually pretty easy even on hard it was easy peasy. (But still remember its a children's game.)But the puzzels where sometimes so hard and then I tought: 'How could a child solve this?'But you know this game isn't onley good as a game but also as a bedtime story for your kids or little brother.So i give it a 24/26.P.S.: The theme song somehow reminds me of a dwarf song.

												Trine 2 is better, but this one's cheaper. Which is to say, you should get this one if you're too poor to buy amazing games!Aaaand I suppose you could get this one if you loved the sequel enough, It's still a good game.No online play though, that's the bad part.

												Quick review:Short Verdict: One of the best games I've ever played! It's a mix of all the genres I love: RPG, puzzle, platformer, exploration, and it also has some fighting. I've loved it so much I beat it twice in a row! I started playing the Original Game (OG), which was amazing, then I moved to Enchanted Edition (EE), which was even better (if you wanna play the game just once, go for EE, although playing both might be worth, since they still feel slightly like different games). I'll definitely play Trine 2 when I have the chance! (Note: I haven't tried playing it online, so I can't comment on that)Pros: Great balanced mix of different game genres Beautiful graphics Awesome BGM Three different interchangeable characters who are likeable and have their unique set of upgradable skills 15+1 long and well-planned distinct levels with their own atmosphere and a lot of secrets to find Collectible equipment to further customize your characters Really addicting, it doesn't get old even if you're replaying a level Nice voice acting, especially the narrator's Even though the game is old, the devs are still responsive at the forums, especially after EE, I guessCons: Zoya, the Thief, is a bit overpowered I wish there was more to the story--I thought it was a bit shallow and I wanted more A bit easy for me, even on hard (haven't tried the OG-exclusive Very Hard Mode though) (OG ONLY!) Moving objects is slower than needed to be (a lot faster on EE) (OG ONLY!) Conjuring objects with the controller is a pain (improved on EE) (OG ONLY!) Bats are really annoying and seem a bit broken (they've been removed from EE)Bought on / for: Humble Store for US$ 0.99. But it's definitely worth the full price they're asking for!

												There are many things that can be said about the, ""Trinelogy"". For starters, the graphics are pretty good. The puzzles on their own aren't necessarily the hardest thing to get by, however they're still very fun. The characters aren't necessarily the most well balanced, as there is a certain one of the 3 that can be pretty bad *cough the knight cough*.  The narrator fits the tone of the game quite well which also makes it fairly entertaining. This game also has the very elusive Box Wizard! Yes, you heard it here first folks, there is a Box Wizard. He is a professional Boxer in a sense that he can summon boxes! He can also summon some other stuff, but who cares about that when you have freaking boxes?!?!The story of the game is also pretty enjoyable, making it a great game to unwind to. So, if you want to adventure as a Thief, Knight, and a Box Wizard, the Trine series is perfect for you. If you're not sure if you want to get into this game, I'd still give it a go, you never know, you might enjoy crushing your enemies under some boxes.Side note, this game is so awesome that it thanked coffee in the end credits!

												A big yes! Do buy this game and you will not regret it!While you have to solve the puzzles truly  thinking  about it, you won't be hurried. You will have to be pretty precise, especially with the wizard, but not frustratingly so. Creativity is required, and there are many ways to solve a problem.Beautiful graphics and a fary tale like narration really make this game a little gem.The only problem I found is that, if you are playing with a controller (mine is an Xbox one), the game doesn't tell you how to use the abilities of fire arrows (Y) button, titan force (left stick, tap right stick, tap again when fully charged // LT for the quick burst), and the hammer (Y again).  It really worried me for a minute.But then again, beside that it's truly, absolutely, completely worth it. Can't wait to play the second!			",14,2,0,1,0,0,0

												This game is great for one or maybe two evenings with your friends. I only recommend playing it with two friends locally because alone it is just a wild switching of characters. The fun comes if you can't switch on the most useful character at the time. So you get to think.Even funny if you play with drunk people although I mostly feel annoyed by them.Still waiting for my two mates to get another session, since we just got to the second to last stage.

												Verdict: Why haven't you bought this already?!This game has just had a completely free, absolutely stunning graphics upgrade, and co-op multi-player added where it originally had none, 5 years after original release, FOR FREE. Let this sink in for a moment, in this day and age of nickle&diming for worthless trinket pixel additions or triple A pricing for practically untouched re-releases. If you already own this, it is worth reinstalling and playing all over again; if you don't own it, it's worth every penny.At the current sales price of 80-90% off for ALL Frozenbytes games (Trine 1&2 and Shadowgrounds), you really should just stop reading this and go buy whatever parts your collection is missing, right now. In fact, buy copies for all your friends. This company needs encouragement, and their success needs to be a bright beacon of enlightenment for games developers and publishers out there.There's free demos to all their games if you're still doubting. Its unique experience is best understood through direct gameplay anyway. Get it, play it, then tell me again this isn't worth paying for.Btw, performance tip: if you use the enchanted version with an NVidia GPU, make sure to add the trine1_32bit.exe file to the NVidia control panel under Manage 3D Settings, otherwise even though it uses the same engine as Trine 2, you will get a lot worse performance. The enchanted executable is in a subdirectory of the main Trine game folder. Doing this with the free downloadable nvidiaInspector and adding to the predefined Trine 2 profile is probably the best way to take advantage of the optimizations for the updated engine.

												Most beautiful puzzle platformer I've ever played. Damn, I love this game. Seriously. I want to hug it and kiss it, it's THAT good. The game is simple. You complete levels by solving the puzzles. And these puzzles are mostly solved using physics. Depending on the puzzle, you choose one of three characters (you can switch between them on the fly) to solve them. Along the way you battle enemies and collect orbs to level up. You can also find chests with items, so it also has an RPG element to it. A shame the game is over too soon, I really did not want it to end. So I had to replay it several times since then, which, of course, I didn't mind at all. Yes, this is a must have ! Bring on Trine 2 !! Woohooo !![Rating: 92/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												A fun game, with minor RPG elements, wonderful art style and visuals , albeit slightly repetitive gameplay and lack of character depth.The first thing about this game is the amazing visuals. It is a pleasure to play simply to look at the environment. The detail to the characters, spells, enemies and background art is great. The voiceover of the characters is also very well done. All in all, the production and art, design elements are top notch.The gameplay mechanics are well done - but the areas that could have been improved are the RPG elements. The gear and skills for each character are fairly irrelevant. It doesn't seem to be much of a stretch to say you could ignore all the gear and all the skills and finish the game without notice that you didn't use anything. They are merely small accents to your character - which is cool - but feels like it could have been developed more to make each character even more specialized and the party dynamic more rich.  As it stood, I used the fighter all the time and only switched to the mage when I needed a box and the thief when I needed to swing (and maybe at least half the time I could just make boxes to achieve the same ends).  This wasn't enough to detract from the fun of the game - it just had me thinking there was a lot of character overlap or lack of puzzle diversity to properly utilize each character more.Leading to the ""puzzles"" - each level, each map was essentially always the same type. Eventually you get slightly different obstacles such as spinning boards, button pushing, but most of the time it was ""jump, make a box, jump, make a box, (maybe swing)"".  More diversity in this area would have enhanced things. Same with the story. I don't put much weight into the story, but it could have also been a lot more interesting than it ultimately turns out to me. It was only 10 hours in length for me, and I don't play very fast, so expect others could go through even faster.With that said, it was still a very fun game. Recommended if on sale for sure.  I have bought the 2nd game (as a testament to the enjoyment of the first) and hope some of the things above are more fleshed out making it really what it could be. Then if things go well, onto the 3rd installment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A good platforming/puzzle solving game. You can switch between a thief, mage, or knight at any time to solve different puzzles and fight. The graphics are outstanding, especially for an indie game. Probably the best graphics I've ever seen in a indie game, really high quality professional grade. Tight, responsive controls (I play with a wired xbox 360 controller), good sound, great gameplay, and just a really well made game that is a pleasure to look at and play. It's only downfall is that it is very short (6 hours or so). 8/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												Blah, blah, blah, that describes the story, the gameplay and the difficulty. Puzzles, if you want to call them that, to get experience, boil down to draw something out with the mage and then push it off the hard to reach ledge to the ground. Combat, get the warrior and just charge mashing the attack button. Platforming, why even do it when the mage can just walk across everything with even the fainest amount of intuition.The auxilaries to what this type of game is about, meaning graphics and soundtrack, are good. Not good enough to save this abysmal experience. You can just pass by this for something that does this gameplay sytle properly.			",64,14,0,12,10,0,11

												It's a great story, told in an effective way. It's one of the best tales I've experienced.The music, sounds, characters, dialouges, skills, everything was made to get a full experience. One of the best soundtracks I've heard in my entire life.It's really enjoyable, everyone should try it. The only thing that bugs me are the enemies and how and how much they respawn.Trine 2 is better in almost every way, but it's nice to see where it came from.8.5/10			",186,35,0,6,8,1,14

												Trine is a delightfully charming platformer that is fun to play both by yourself and with others. Both playthroughs I enjoyed.Pros:- Absolutely gorgeous world! The colors are amazing, everything looks crisp, and the whole game looked mystical. - I like the switching through characters. Every character has his or her own abilities, and they are all distinct. Playing as each character is a different experience and way of getting from A to B.- Solid character controlling for the most part. I appreciate any side scrolling game with a good idea on how jumping and moving around should feel. No awkwardness here.- Playing this game made me happy. I don't know how else to explain it.Cons:- Sometimes the game would freeze. That's never fun.- The drawing button for the wizard and the move objects button should be different! Ahh! The only button mapping that bugged me.- The segments at the beginning of the levels are dumb. You stare at a map while you wait for the narrator to finish speaking. Very rarely do narrators in a video game work.- Come to think of it, the voice acting in general was meh.- Was that even a story?- What is the point of mana? The meter would decrease but never enough to make me think ""man I wish I had more mana"" because there are checkpoints frequently.- I wish it was longer!  One playthrough lasts about 4 hours or so, longer if you want to level all the way up.The downsides for Trine are definitely there, but they weren't significant enough to make me dislike this game or not want to play anymore. Trine is worth it for the stunning visuals and the fun gameplay with friends I'd say. I never played this game thinking eek when is this going to end. I didn't want it to end!There are no jump scares, only pretty things to look at.			",134,159,1,10,4,0,9

												One of the best Co-op platformer I have played :D Solo, and Co-op experience can be very different. Soloing will be 1 hero, but switching between Knight, Thief, and Wizard. Each has his/her own abilities, that will help you through the level. Basically, you utilized what you had to accomplish the goal. However, Co-op will change your playstyle completely, since it is 3 heroes mode, so each hero's abilities can be combine to bypass..(cough) I mean to pass through the level. Found a gap, with some danger below? why not use the ""Rocket Knight Express"" to cross it :D			",538,88,19,74,40,1,60

												Trine is a interesting side scroller to be sure, I find the puzzles and combat in the game to be simple and fun. The environment looks nice aswell. I dont find the game to be very difficult, even on the higher difficulty levels, and in the end I think the game is pretty short. Trine has modability though, so this may help sway your decision if you are worried about getting enough bang for your buck. I would recommend Trine to anyone looking for a sidescrolling puzzle/ action game.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												Played plenty of this offline. The enchanted edition updates the visuals of an already delightful platformer. If you like platformers and like the look of the gameplay from trailers - you won't be disappointed by this game. It's not necessarily the most hardcore or involving affair - even on the max difficulties, and the narrative isn't terribly compelling, but it is pleasant - whimsical - and beautiful. A perfect game if you just need to relax and feel like you're in some fantasy world. The soundtrack is superb. Would give it two thumbs up if I could.			",121,54,0,22,12,0,31

												Relaxing, easy to get into and very fluently working platform/physics-puzzler. Gorgeous, colorful background/art design (it's a really great looking game). Not very difficult, but there are a few more tricky obstacles. You control one out of three, instantly switchable characters with different abilities to navigate the levels, manipulate it's objects, create your own or fight enemies. These three characters have some personality, but you don't get to know much of their backgrounds and they remain stereotypes mostly:- Charming, lady-lover wizard who conjures boxes, planks and platforms. Kills enemies with physics.- Mysterious, reserved thief who uses a grappling hook to pull and swing herself around. Kills enemies with bow.- Overweight knight and wannabe hero who likes food and drinking. Uses shield to avoid damage. Kills enemies with sword.The story leaves to be desired. There is one, there is a narrator speaking before each level and the characters sometimes comment things too. But it's your generic good vs evil fantasy thing. There is a name-giving ""Trine"" artifact binding the souls of the three characters together. It sounded interesting first, but it's not worked out further, it's only a tool to give reason why these otherwise very different personalities come together for an adventure, and creates the outline of it.

												First of all I start of by saying, this game felt so great to me I had to get all the achievements and try everything out. I did it, and boy would I do it again. If you want an atmospheric platformer with puzzle elements this is the game for you. Not only because the game is just something you should've played. It's also a bit different than your normal platformer. Because you can switch between 3 different characters while playing with a simple push on the button. A warrior, who is strong and fierce, a mage who can't cast a fireball, and a ninja-like archer. + Character switching feels quick+ The level design is amazing+ The story is alright, but the narrating is done much better+ The various abilities keep the game fun+ Doesn't feel liniair- Terrible controller controls / Magician not playable I definitly recommend getting Trine. Besides it's on sale alot. And in my opinion it's worth it's full price.			",219,62,4,17,22,5,23

												As an old and avid fan of The Lost Vikings, I was thrilled to see a game with a similiar concept popping up. And damn, it's fun! The combination of puzzles and action that force you to use the three different characters as effectively as you can keeps you entertained and on your toes. Sometimes the objective can be unclear and some solutions not obvious enough, but the humour, tons of collectibles and rewarding way to progress will make up for it. I'm almost done with the game and can't wait to get my hand on the sequel!PS: Who needs fireballs, anyway?			",458,162,7,76,54,5,67

												A nice, fun game for those who don't mind playing other things than shooters (I already have too many shooters on steam.... I needed something different)Pros: -not bad story -the thief <3 -interesting gameplay (if you like platformers)Cons:- if you leave the game, you must start the level from the beginning. It could have been since the last checkpoint.... Esp. since levels aren't quite short (about half hour to one hour each, i think)- not so long (about 9h)Overall: not **THE best** game out there, but recommended if you are bored of too many shooters.... at least this is different. And cheap. PS: no, I'm not very good at reviews.			",274,77,11,60,19,0,52

												Trine is what you call a throwback and has the classic platform gaming akin to the lost vikings. You have three characters each responsible for their own trait, beign magician, theif and warrior. You must combine their skills to traverse the levels of the game which are fun and filled with peril but not once did i find myself fustrated as the mechanics are well polished. an 8/10 game but excellent.

												Lovely game. Pleasent graphics and cute settings. There is more challenge to trine 1 than 2, because in 1 you have mana. This means that the wiz can only do so much in between checkpoints, you have to manage your abilities. In trine 2 you can just go ham.Trine 1 was also much shorter than trine 2, but regardless I would recommend you get it if it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is a very beutiful game that features a lot of jumping around on platforms while doing things like shooting ropes, avoid traps and fighting monsters.  Unfortunatly I am not very good at these kinds of games and found it very furstrating.  If you like that kind of game and would also like a puzzle element then I would reccomend this game for you.  If you are not so much into the dexterous manipulation of a character on moving platforms over pits of death (or exreme damage), then stay away from this game.			",173,37,0,73,40,0,75

												First of all I start of by saying, this game felt so great to me I had to get all the achievements and try everything out. I did it, and boy would I do it again. If you want an atmospheric platformer with puzzle elements this is the game for you. Not only because the game is just something you should've played. It's also a bit different than your normal platformer. Because you can switch between 3 different characters while playing with a simple push on the button. A warrior, who is strong and fierce, a mage who can't cast a fireball, and a ninja-like archer. + Character switching feels quick+ The level design is amazing+ The story is alright, but the narrating is done much better+ The various abilities keep the game fun+ Doesn't feel liniair- Terrible controller controls / Magician not playable I definitly recommend getting Trine. Besides it's on sale alot. And in my opinion it's worth it's full price.			",219,62,4,17,22,5,23

												If you own Trine one you get the Enchanted Edition for FREE!It a complete remake of the game with Trine 2 Graphic engine.It fixes all the bug issues it had when Trine, for smoother gameplay.You get to play with your friends in MultiiplayerGames around 7-9 hours long. Puzzles wern't super hard but it made you think.Trine is a action puzzle adventure game set with 3 heros that you can switch on the fly., I give the remake a 8/10 I had fun with it, they did a good job remaking it.

												It's been almost two years since I played the sequel (Trine 2) to this game (Trine).  But, when I saw they had updated Trine to the Trine Enchanted Edition by porting it to the same engine used in Trine 2, I jumped at the chance to buy it.  I'm very pleased.  Just like Trine 2, the graphics, sound, and game play are all excellent.  The amazing thing about my liking this game is that I pretty much hate platforming games.  Yet, this is, indeed, a side-scrolling platformer.  The difference is that Trine (and Trine 2) aren't ""twitch"" based platformers.  In general, you have plenty of time to examine the area and can consider the platforming aspect to be part of the puzzle solving aspect of the game.  My only serious complaint with the game is that the last level (and the hidden level that unlocks after you finish that last level) is pure, twitchy, time-limited platforming.  It's frustrating.  But, considering that this is just one level (or two, if you count the bonus level) out of 16, I can live with it.  Plus, considering that I got a tad more than 20 hours of really fun gameplay (getting to that 100% Achiement level), I'd say Trine is definitely worth the price.			",77,70,0,12,8,0,3

												Remember ""The Lost Vikings"" from 1992?  By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, ""Rock 'n Roll Racing""?No?  Where you alive back then?  If not, then you have a temporary excuse.  Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine.  If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of ""The Lost Vikings"", and play it through to the end.  If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of ""The Lost Vikings"" for your eighth birthday.  Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses.  Go.  When you're done playing through the game, come back.  I'll be waiting.If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person.  That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance.  You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.Alright.  Done playing through ""The Lost Vikings""?  ""Trine"" is a lot like that.  Slightly different abilities for your ""Vikings"", and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea.  Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).What, never heard of worm-jumping?  Were you alive/competent in 1997?  See the above paragraphs, and replace ""The Lost Vikings"" with ""Worms 2"".  You'll thank me.			",96,27,0,12,9,2,17

The graphics and details are good to the point that sometimes I stopped just to look.  The three characters you play are very different and it is near impossible to beat this game by only using one character.Overall the game is very good for an indie game.

												Trine is enchanting in several ways, they do not lie to you when they say its the enchanted edition. The gameplay is fast and fun, using the wizard to summon blocks to jump up to unreachable hights, then shooting skeletons with the theifs bow. The puzzles are difficult and will keep you interested, while trying to find the hidden xp bottles around the place. Trine is a very pretty game, beautiful even. The graphics are memorable and even if your not a big fan of platformers you can still get lots of enjoyment out of this game, mainly because of its well excecuted boss fights and interesting dialogue. For all ages, I would recommend this as a worthy pickup. Here is my overall rate: Graphics 8/10Gameplay 8/10 Dialogue 7/10 Story 6/10 (not mind blowing but interesting enough to keep me playing) 9/10 would get crushed by my own blocks again.

												As an old and avid fan of The Lost Vikings, I was thrilled to see a game with a similiar concept popping up. And damn, it's fun! The combination of puzzles and action that force you to use the three different characters as effectively as you can keeps you entertained and on your toes. Sometimes the objective can be unclear and some solutions not obvious enough, but the humour, tons of collectibles and rewarding way to progress will make up for it. I'm almost done with the game and can't wait to get my hand on the sequel!PS: Who needs fireballs, anyway?			",458,162,7,76,54,5,67

Dont catch me wrong, this game is so beautiful especially for a indie title. The amount of time spent creating this dazzling landscape must have been emense. I also apreciate the large amount of levels. Unfortunatly there is another negative this games puzzle are rather bland I have played it through and most puzzle are ""build a brigde"" or ""press a button"" while avoiding skeletons and arrows. In the end I would say yeh buy this game just for the amazing scenes and cool charecter playthrough.			",68,7,2,8,14,1,7

												Beautiful game Enjoyed it through and through until the crappy last levelEdit: I have decided to update a few of my reviews and give them a bit more essence  then basically the thumbs up + tiny explaination or the likejust look at the screenshots to see how good looking this game is the movement is good and the pacing also felt goodthe reason that I thought that the last level was crappy is because (SPOILER) it is a timed event with a bit of a luck system to it in that you have to outjump a rising lava flow (or something like that) and obsticals and enemies are in the way while you are trying to climb to not insta die from the lava, however I must have had the worst luck ever because time and again in different parts of the climb mid jump a randomly generated falling debri would hit me straight into the lava or the debri would land and pile up in such a way that it blocked any possible progress upwards or to the next platform that I needed to get on or having my charactor glitch into a platform after being hit by a debri and not being able to move thus dieing to rising lava flow. All in all this level took me like 13 tries to finally beat it while every other level I beat first or second time through			",179,71,1,15,14,0,21

Grab the game on sale and was surprised it could go for so cheap. Sure it's an old IP, but the devil's in the details. Especially if you include the touched up code and textures in the enhanced edition.Simplistic, but a platformer done absolutely right.			",25,6,0,10,3,0,0

												Wow, I can't believe I haven't said anything about Trine yet.On top of that - what? This game has ANY negative reviews? Wtf?Trine. This is one of the most breathtaking, fantastic games I have seen in the past decade. It's just stunning. The graphics are incredible, the physics based stuff is all hugely entertaining, and I find obliterating skeletons to be immensely satisfying. It's just fun. I enjoyed going back to levels and redoing them time and again to find stuff I missed, because they were just that good. I play with mouse n keyboard, naturally, so I didn't really have any issues with my controls. I can't imagine trying to play Trine with a DS3 or Xbox controller.Zoya is my favourite, naturally, Amadeus is my least favourite. Being a wizard is nice and all, but he really only exists to make boxes, for the most part. And you can end up making a -lot- of boxes. But, yeah. Pontius is okay too, and his hammer is AMAZING. It's awesome to see everything on the screen explode.I never really had any issues with the difficulty. It's fun enough just going through the game. The story is, when you really think about it, quite plain - essentially, skeletons appeared, and then three random heroes touched a thing called the Trine and became one in a way. But I still love it. It's just so quaint, and gives me a warm happy feeling inside. What's better than a story about knights in shining armor (and his thief companion, and the cowardly wizard guy who followed them about)?This game has no real elongated cutscenes or anything. It's just a simple platformer. You jump around the level, and hopefully you're the thief and you abuse the hell out of your grappling hook. The grappling hook is in my opinion one of the best parts of this game. It's just way too much fun to swing about with.The soundtrack is amazing. It's just amazing. The tone of the game is perfectly in harmony with what you're seeing, and it always feels appropriate. Each level has it's own theme. I love it.And the last level... I loved it. It was extremely challenging the first time, but that's great! I actually felt challenged, properly, not just because the devs had a range of multipliers for enemy HP and damage (which the game has anyway, but I played on hard nonetheless) but also because on this last level, the 'AI' drops stuff in front of you as you're going up this tower. If you're not fast enough, the lava rising with you gets you. It took me several tries to beat the first time, but it's absolutely just a measure of skill, even now when I'm out of practice I bet I could go back and complete again, easy. It's just about learning.I can't recommend this game enough. Some people complained that the levels aren't varied enough, but honestly I disagree. You're not just wandering around a castle, there's quite a variety of beautiful areas to get through, and I feel like each level has it's own set of things that distinguishes it from the other levels, they really don't all feel the same to me at all. Would you say Super Mario isn't varied enough, because you just go from one end of the level to the other, platforming along the way? No, you wouldn't.In short, Trine is an amazing game, especially at the price. It's on sale for as low as $1.50 so frequently you can set your watch by it. I think I remember this game being only $10 at one point, I don't really remember them raising it, but, hey, I'd pay $15 for it again if I knew beforehand how much enjoyment I would get from it.

												Trine. It's hard to know what's more beautiful, the story or the graphics. Like, seriously, if you have a good computer, the visuals are stunning. Even comparable to Bastion. This is a great game to pick up on sale, or at regular price if you're feeling generous.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trine is simply beautiful. But that's not the only great thing about this game. The physics engine and the ability to manipulate the objects in the game in your favor is what make this game great and worth buying. It has a balance of not being too hard but not being too easy. Only thing that's missing is Co Up, but that would be fixed in Trine 2. This gets a solid 8/10 from me.			",123,6,4,15,3,3,15

												2D platformer with combat, rpg progression, and really, really shiny graphics. Pleasant enough music, so it won't grate your ears. Grab the game on sale and was surprised it could go for so cheap. Sure it's an old IP, but the devil's in the details. Especially if you include the touched up code and textures in the enhanced edition.Simplistic, but a platformer done absolutely right.			",25,6,0,10,3,0,0

												Wow, I can't believe I haven't said anything about Trine yet.On top of that - what? This game has ANY negative reviews? Wtf?Trine. This is one of the most breathtaking, fantastic games I have seen in the past decade. It's just stunning. The graphics are incredible, the physics based stuff is all hugely entertaining, and I find obliterating skeletons to be immensely satisfying. It's just fun. I enjoyed going back to levels and redoing them time and again to find stuff I missed, because they were just that good. I play with mouse n keyboard, naturally, so I didn't really have any issues with my controls. I can't imagine trying to play Trine with a DS3 or Xbox controller.Zoya is my favourite, naturally, Amadeus is my least favourite. Being a wizard is nice and all, but he really only exists to make boxes, for the most part. And you can end up making a -lot- of boxes. But, yeah. Pontius is okay too, and his hammer is AMAZING. It's awesome to see everything on the screen explode.I never really had any issues with the difficulty. It's fun enough just going through the game. The story is, when you really think about it, quite plain - essentially, skeletons appeared, and then three random heroes touched a thing called the Trine and became one in a way. But I still love it. It's just so quaint, and gives me a warm happy feeling inside. What's better than a story about knights in shining armor (and his thief companion, and the cowardly wizard guy who followed them about)?This game has no real elongated cutscenes or anything. It's just a simple platformer. You jump around the level, and hopefully you're the thief and you abuse the hell out of your grappling hook. The grappling hook is in my opinion one of the best parts of this game. It's just way too much fun to swing about with.The soundtrack is amazing. It's just amazing. The tone of the game is perfectly in harmony with what you're seeing, and it always feels appropriate. Each level has it's own theme. I love it.And the last level... I loved it. It was extremely challenging the first time, but that's great! I actually felt challenged, properly, not just because the devs had a range of multipliers for enemy HP and damage (which the game has anyway, but I played on hard nonetheless) but also because on this last level, the 'AI' drops stuff in front of you as you're going up this tower. If you're not fast enough, the lava rising with you gets you. It took me several tries to beat the first time, but it's absolutely just a measure of skill, even now when I'm out of practice I bet I could go back and complete again, easy. It's just about learning.I can't recommend this game enough. Some people complained that the levels aren't varied enough, but honestly I disagree. You're not just wandering around a castle, there's quite a variety of beautiful areas to get through, and I feel like each level has it's own set of things that distinguishes it from the other levels, they really don't all feel the same to me at all. Would you say Super Mario isn't varied enough, because you just go from one end of the level to the other, platforming along the way? No, you wouldn't.In short, Trine is an amazing game, especially at the price. It's on sale for as low as $1.50 so frequently you can set your watch by it. I think I remember this game being only $10 at one point, I don't really remember them raising it, but, hey, I'd pay $15 for it again if I knew beforehand how much enjoyment I would get from it.

												I have to say, I was given these games as a gift. What a cool thing, to find a game with the appeal of a well crafted game. This game has so much lush beauty that my video card (GTX 580Ti) is Loving being opened up and showing all the bells and whistles. The upgrade made Trine 1 look better, but they Both are Beautiful, and are Really fun to play. I've been told it is a benefit to use the WASD and mouse but I have, not seen a problem with either. Could be a slower or pooer performing Video card. I haven't touched a thing. If anything, I turned it Up! Have a look at some of the Trine 2 Screenchots, they'd make a great set of rotating screen savers .			",476,196,5,47,25,3,21

												I'm starting to think physics games are doomed to fail for either not being realistic, or being too realistic. Trine somehow manages to combine both, in the worst way.The good:-Beautiful designs and backgrounds-Decent narrative-The mix of characters sometimes work well and are all utilised in finishing levels-When the physics does work, it's very satisfyingThe bad:-The narrative is often infuriatingly interrupted by things in-game, and then not continued until the next stage-The movement of characters, enemies, and objects is all much much too sloppy and often seems like everything's on ice, and covered in oil, making precision nigh on impossible-The physics doesn't work 90% of the timeThe game is actually impressive in how annoying it is, maybe because it has so potential that it fails to harness.

												By far the best puzzle platformer game i've ever played, it's a steal for it's current price at 75% off (around 2.5€). The graphicstyle is unique and its just beautiful. Gameplay is pretty fun even if you are alone as the game is pretty addicting IMO (mostly due to the leveling system). The game is pretty hard on ""hard"" difficulty and there is also a ""very hard"" mode if you are looking for a challenge. Hours of gameplay: 20+ (If you want all the achievements).

												This is /one/ of my favourite indie games for three reasons and i'll tell you why: 1. The visuals are stunning, lovingly crafted and still look beautiful three+ years on.2. The main gameplay point, one where you play one of three characters which you can swap between seamlessly makes for some really cool basic puzzling and combat. 3. The story itself is somewhat generic fantasy but that's something that really appeals to me and pulls this off in a manner that is not too sterotypical to the point where it becomes annoying but is just cliched enough that you recognize and enjoy it.A great platformer, the high point being it's stunning visuals and rope-swinging thief character.

												Trine is a story-telling puzzle and platformer game that I enjoyed very much in the gameplay and coop aspect. While I want to give this game my whole-hearted recommendation, I had to hesitate because I found that the game failed in the story-telling department. The first thing you notice when you start the game is the stunningly beautiful graphics which help set up this mystical atmosphere that just makes you eager to play the game. Because of that, I also grew a high expectation from the story. Sadly, as you progress through the game you start to realise that the story is almost... non-existent, in addition to a very anti-climatic and disappointing finale. I will say though, that at least the puzzles and platforming provided a decent challenge and that it was overall a pretty fun game.So the question is, is the game worth buying? Yes, but not at the full price. It's definitely something worth trying if you like platforming and/or playing a good coop game with friends.			",243,102,4,47,13,2,32

												Interesting puzzles and good atmosphere make for a pleasant experience. I can't say too much about the story since I just couldn't get into it. The 'leveling' seems a bit slapped on and doesn't really add too much since you're effectively railroaded into it anyway; same could be said about the inventory. These things and the occasional focus on fighting things just don't seem to fit very well. Some skellie killing is all well and good, throwing a boss into a puzzle room is much fun, but the times when you're screen locked into fighting 1by1 spawning is weird for this kind of game.As for the co-op... Honestly it's way easier to do yourself. And the level doesn't change with multiple people so it's completely unnecessary to have the other person. If anything you're just slowing each other down. I would not recommend this as a good co-op for those looking for a challenging puzzle game to play together. For just horsing around, sure.Trine is not a bad game, but I wouldn't list it as the most amazing/best platformer of its time. It's interesting, a little different, and could be something to do for a little while.			",26,1,0,0,0,0,1

												This is basically Lost Vikings 4. You have three very different characters that all need to get through a side-scrolling platformer. The controls are a little clumsy, and were clearly meant for a game controller.Fun, but not fun enough for me to buy the sequel.If you enjoy the pseudo-co-op Lost Vikings style of gameplay, you'll like this. Don't play it with mouse and keyboard. You'll get pretty frustrated.			",168,33,0,50,30,4,67

												Playthrough without trying to get all secrets is about 6.5 hours, so it's pretty short. But, the gameplay is extremely solid with very few glitches and it is very unique. Combat can get intense when you're trying to make ""combos"" by switching between warrior and thief to beat back archers and melee scarytons at the same time, and the actual platforming aspect is pretty good. Strong level variation. The art style and the soundtrack combine to make this game extremely atmospheric as well. Soundtrack is great and the visual/level design variations are well done. 8.5/10.

The sequel is also very good.Update: The new and improved Enchanted Edition has brought the gameplay up a peg to the level of the sequel, which is also a must play.12 / 12,Must play.

												To be honest with everyone, I didnt enjoy this game. But I woke up everyday and took my cup of coffee playing it for an hour. The art design and platforming mechanics are simply that good. The game itself however... isnt what I was expecting.The sound track keeps going on a loop and the story line doesnt exist basically. Enemy AI is ridiculous, they keep killing themselves mostly before they even reach me.The game is Easy. It is EASY. Unless you play on hardcore difficulty or you are on the last level. The last level took me 4 tries. It makes you panic and you are easy to do so. 6/10 - All 6 points for artistic blend. This game made me lookup how many levels are left to finish it on google.

												At first I thought ""well, despite the cons, I paid only 1.49 for it"", but it's not fair and would sound convenient for the makers; even if it was for free I wouldn't recommend this game.The characters are too annoyingly unstable. Meaning, for example, that if the char is on the edge of a platform since few seconds, he/she may fall after a little while without pushing any button; other example is: given a distance between the point where you're at and the ledge where you have to grab on, one time he/she will grab the ledge and another time he/she wouldn't. Making you fall on an acid pit or spikes, of course.The graphis are pretty rich but the surroundings are not clear and defined. You have to put your eyes under continuous stress to keep playing, otherwise you won't distinguish the playing ground from the background.			",30,9,1,4,2,0,0

												There are two words to describe Trine and that is visual splendor. There are very few indie games out there that has this much color and graphical fidelity. Trine is extremely pleasing to the eyes and it perfected the fairy tale graphical style. While the graphic is magnificent, the 2D plat-forming gameplay is just average. There are virtually zero depth in puzzles and progression, basically a child can play this game and get to the end without fail. Trine excels in the mega casual plat-forming department, but if you are looking for any form of challenge at all, this is the wrong game to be buying.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												When asked to describe my thoughts about Trine, only one word comes to mind.NOPE!I was shocked, literally shocked when I viewed the review of this game. One after another kept saying it is good.But it's so far from the truth.When one delves deeper into the depths of Trine one might not come back the same as he once was.Trine shares a common trait with certain platformers, for instance you must collect certain items each level to get that perfect score. Yet most levels require several playthroughs before you can finish them 100%, not that it's bad.But when you come to a certain point where you needed to jump slightly instead of running off of it, and that wasn't the first time you forgot it either, comes frustration. And as I was playing things just kept adding up.The story was pure horribleness, the attempt at humour was even worse, the wizard is the most annoying character in the game, once the thief is dead you might as well restart the level seeing as most levels requires her to finish.The items are terrible, I can't remember if I ever found something for the wizard, not that I would care to either but there's a certain principle of things.The enemies are pure moronic, they will either try to kill you with a wall between you and him. Or just casually walk off a cliff trying to get to you. Bats are only there to rid you of your health, a lazy enemy at best.This game is stupid, I don't know why nor would I be able to comprehend anyone that likes this.My joy was killed at the beginning of the game, and the horrors of 2player mode (control-wise) ensured me that I would never be playing this again.Also, why does this game have or even need 2 sequels, I can think of at least several things that could've benefited from all the money and time that went into their creation. Like planting a tree or stepping on my balls so I would've been midly distracted when hearing such news.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Short verdict: a beautiful art style is not enough to make a game good.PROS:+ Beautiful art style+ CoOp (incuding local CoOp on the same screen)CONS:- Primitive, almost non-existent story- Lousy, inconvenient controls- Easy straightforward ''puzzles'', which you can easily bypass with Amadeus (the Wizard) on CoOp.- No actual final boss battle, just a sloppy cutscene after an annoying climbing stage.- Just four (?) types of enemies (3 skeleton warriors and a spider).This game is highly overrated.Overall rating: 6/10 ",139,38,1,27,5,2,24

The controls are tight - you will have a lot of fun with all 3 of your characters, playing them in 3 different ways to jump around the levels and defeat the baddies.The main downsides of this game are two. First of all, it's just not challenging. I'm not sure if this game was trying to be a puzzle platformer but it falls down on both the puzzling and the platforming. In terms of puzzles, nothing really confuses you for more than a few breaths. Exploiting the physics of the game to move around the levels is usually how it's done but gets old after awhile. The story is also lacking. It's entirely non-descript. This may be a non-issue for some, especially given the short length of the game, but along with the lack of challenge this meant it got boring by the end of my four hour playtime.If you're particularly intrigued by the concept of this game or you find a great sale, go for it! It's a fun little romp. If you're looking for a bit more depth, look elsewhere!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought Trine and installed it on my PC.  Trine came with addware that my anti virus software detected.  The addware was quarantined and the game would not work with the addware in quarantine.  The steam help refused to admit that there was adware in the game but they refunded me for the game.  Don't purchase this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all i played the game on single, so I have no experience of the coop story.I got this game is some HumbleBundle, I didn't go to buy itso I have no regrets of actually getting it, but I didn't enjoy this game.The graphics look good, but I din't like the art style, everything has a ton of bloom, I felt like my retinas were burning. The jumping was normal, nothing extremly good but not horrid. It frustrated me at a times were the character did not act as I had wished for.Overall a decent game if you are into platformers (I a) I guess this game is more fun coop (only has local coop) but I wouldn't recomend buying.

												I don't understand the appeal of this game. I disliked every minute I played it. I kept wondering why I was playing and then stopped after less than an hour. I tried playing it with a friend hoping that would make it more enjoyable, but it didn't. I just don't like this game. Besides the wonky controls and the lackluster level design, I just didn't understand the point of this game. It feels like a demo for a game I wouldn't want to buy. I wish I could elaborate more and more eloquently describe what it is I dislike so much about this game, but I think it's just a bunch of little things combined with the fact that it feels like it was designed for a child to play that together make me dislike this so much.

												Starts out easy enough and fairly enjoyable.  The puzzles get slightly harder, but its fairly even through out the levels.  Then all of a sudden at the end, the puzzles get much harder, and there are unreasonable amounts of enemies.  They just spawn, and spawn, and spawn, and you have to wait until they are done before you can complete the puzzle.  Then the last level shoots the difficulty all the way up to completely insane.  I was playing medium difficulty, and after getting killed 6 times after spending 5 minutes climbing, I went down to easy mode, which didn't make much difference.  The last level would make a nun curse out loud.Other than the ridiculous difficulty ramp, the story is bland and tacked on between the levels.  The enemies are all basically the same skeleton, and are plain and boring.  You are always forced to fight them as they will aggressively chase after you, pulling off insane manoeuvres like leaping 40 feet in the air to grab the ledge you are on.Overall, the game was OK but did not live up to the hype.  Worth buying if you like side-scrollers and it is on sale.			",227,8,18,11,22,0,51

												Remarkably frustrating for such a shallow, simplistic game. Repetitive gameplay, very little challenge unless you go for the extra experience and hidden areas. Oversaturated graphics look pretty cool but can be distracting at times. Nice music. Story is generic and skeletal at best but doesn't waste your time or detract from the gameplay, and the voice acting is pretty good. Occasionally it is difficult to tell the environment apart from the background, and sometimes parts of the level obstruct the camera.Overall it's not bad; I did play it through to the end. Still, it's nothing too special, even from an indie developer. On a numeric scale I'd rate it a 3/5.			",23,8,0,0,5,0,0

												Did I really just write a whole review about what I hated about Trine, copy it to clipboard, and then accidentally lose it copying the lyrics of Supertramp's ""The Logical Song"" into a review for Chantelise?Yeah. I did.Anyway, this game starts out with the neat idea of a puzzle/adventure game - which seemed to impress a lot of people when it came out - only to stop being creative halfway through and produce a game with the audacity of a day-old gumwad. Stop playing halfway through - I guarantee you did all the enjoyable parts already, the Knight's hammer isn't even that great, and the last level is one of those pseudo-timed lava-slowly-rising dealies. The controls turn out to be too sluggish and most obstacles are better solved with methods that feel like cheating, so the whole experience sort of just falls apart and feels half lazy and half frustratingly vindictive. Sliding off♥♥♥♥♥♥into hazards that were way off screen happens way too often in the late-game.Also the characters are idiotic tropes, the narration is predictable, cheesy, pointless, and even kind of wrong in a couple points (""and then they heard his voice"" isn't really accurate if the only things he does is laugh), and the payoff at the end is just so embarassingly bad it should've been replaced with a big ""YOU WON"" sign. The graphical design is pretty nice in a lot of parts and only confuses you over what's actually something you can step on in a few parts, so that's, uh, positive. A big negative is that a lot of the music sounds like it belongs in a Geico commercial or a bad fantasy parody movie - or one of those off-budget CG movies that try to copy Dreamwork's titles to cash in on grandmas who want to buy their grandchildren a fun DVD but weren't paying enough attention to the ads. Although Netflix is picking up a lot of them now so I guess the irony factor is working out for them.Anyway, if you bought this on Humble Bundle for however close to almost free you wanted to get, fine, whatever, but probably save yourself the hassle and stop after three levels.If you bought it when it came out - thanks to your inflation of its popularity, they made a Trine 2, which I bought before actually playing through this tasteless ♥♥♥♥♥ack. So, thanks for that.			",128,18,1,10,6,2,15

												I feel like people are fooling themselves into liking this game based soley on the beautiful graphics and barely original gameplay. The controls are sloppy and imprecise, which is particularly egregious for a puzzle platformer, the level design is repetitive in all respects except aesthetics, and the balancing of advantages and disadvantages between the three characters is almost non-existent. The game is alright some of the time, but for the most part it just feels like an exercise in futility. It could be a whole lot better if the characters didn't move like they were permanently amped up on cocaine. Seriously why do they have to go so fast? It's the main reason the control feels so poor.Really wanted to like it but I seriously don't understand the hype. 3/10			",39,51,0,7,4,0,3

And the game itself is pretty boring, but I haven't finished.

I've played a lot of games, so my fingers automatically move to my usual left and right buttons. That makes this game less like fun and more an exercise in ongoing annoyance.

Whenever you actually solve one you feel like you just glitched your way through it because the physics are so hideously bad. Might be fun with friends and if you drink enough not to care about all the hidden experience vials, but if, like me, you don't have any friends and enjoy methodically completing games 100%, don't even bother.

												This game is gorgeous, and also the core gameplay design is highly effective. You can switch the 3 characters at any given time if you are required to progress further in a level. The puzzles are also interesting. But my problem is that they treat you as if you were a kid. Is this game made for children? I don't think so. But when you play it, you feel like a child. And I mean that in a negative way. Nowadays, such platform and puzzle games are usually serious and hard to complete. But this one... it cannot be taken seriously, no way. And it isn't funny either. It is way too easy to complete, and the storytelling is so childish that you wanna scream. It has a hype surrounding it which I cannot tolerate. Get serious people. This game is a kitsch. I'll try Trine 2, who knows... I still have some spark of interest left. Maybe part 2 will be better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having three characters in one was an original and worthy idea. However, in solo, that concept break down because of Zoya. Zoya has a grappling hook, that allows her to bypass most puzzles, and zoom accross levels. It's fun to stay in the air for a long time, but that doesn't provide for interesting challenges. Also, since she is also good in combat, she makes Pontius optional, and since Amadeus is so limited, he too is almost optional.The game is obviously meant to be played in coop, so that each character's weaknesses must be compensated by the other's strenghts. You wouldn't be able to zoom accross the level with Zoya, because you would have to find way for Pontius and Amadeus to cross the obstacles. However, I haven't had an opportunity to try that, so i can't tell you if that actually works.However, regardless of whether you liked this game, I do recommend Trine 2, which is awesome in all regards.

The art is nice but the music is forgettable, the gameplay is loose and sluggish, and the aesthetic/way characters interact with their world reminds me of Donkey Kong Country in a bad way.I bought this with Trine 2: Complete Story and I do plan to try that sequel as well to see if things got better. For now though, unless you're a diehard fan of this kind of game or this kind of theme, I would absolutely pass on this.			",38,21,0,2,3,0,5

												This game could've been so good. SO GOOD! But sadly, those rëtärds at Frozenbyte just can't grasp the fact that they're NOT making games for a Nintendo 64 consoles which only has local co-op and that's it. The gameplay in the game is ""interesting"" in a vague sense of the word, and the graphics aren't half-bad, but the lack of any REAL multiplayer (you don't even have LAN in it! NOT EVEN LAN!!!) mode makes the game so bad, so worthless, so boring and utterly crap, that it just makes me plain focking angry. So screw you, Frozenbyte.

I can see trine 32bit running in task manager. I tried turning off my f-secure and it didnt do anything. Also tried re-installing. Same thing happens with Trine 2. The launcher closes but game never shows up. After the launch when i kill the process from task manager i check game cache integrity it shows 1 file not passing and it fixes it and still it does the same every time i try launching the game. Im running windows 8.1 with all drivers up to date. And all other computer specs are more than enough to run the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At its core:+ The graphics are really good and the levels look nice.+ The music, SFX, and dialog sound pretty good overall.+ The characters are somewhat funny.+ The idea/mechanics of the game are interesting, but...- They are executed poorly, in my opinion. Many others would disagree, but this is the biggest point of the game to me. I got severely bored only after 1 hour of play and I was quite happy to get done with the game. I mean no disrespect to the creators, but it just did not click with me. It was mostly repetitive and stale.Others would presumably disagree.			",159,61,0,14,6,1,6

												Oh god, Trine is one of the most boring and monotonous games I've ever played. It really doesn't get much more trivial than this for a platformer, even Super Mario Bros. has more variety and little unnecessary filler.The AI is dumb and will constantly fall off ledges and jump back up, only to fall off again. Weapons are slow and inaccurate, the wizard's conjuration ability requires such precision that it becomes useless in any combat situation. Also, why can't I jump and fire arrows or use my conjuration spells in the air? Stupid limitations.The premise is interesting, the Trine mechanics are innovative, albeit contrived. The story is lacklustre. The narration during the loading screens is so slow and fragmented that I can't be bothered waiting to hear what's being told.The levels are all too similar in layout and lack inspiration. The puzzle mechanics aren't challenging and are too predictable, they seem to be the only reason for the physics engine to exist in the first place.Co-op is almost unplayable and seemed tacked on ""just because"" as both players control one of three characters, but only have access to two of the characters at a time, which slows down gameplay considerably. It also doesn't make sense in context with the Trine itself. The option for three player co-op is there but I'm not certain many people would be able to take advantage of this on PC.

												Mediocre.This game seems to suffer from an identity crisis? What is it? Quoting the manual, ""Trine is a great platformer game for the modern era infused with action and puzzle elements""Well, I'm afraid it doesn't do any of these particularly well.The jumping is sloppy, and you never really feel confident in landing in any particular spot. The game's physics are sloppy. Very frequently I found myself trying to ""brute force"" my way through jumps, especially when landing on platforms which are affected by the mass upon them (such as beams which pivot around their centre).The puzzles are based on the physics engine, and quite often involve using the Wizard to move/create blocks and planks to get somewhere. However, this is often sloppy. It feels more like you're 'guiding' blocks around, careful not to knock down any towers you have built to get anywhere, as the thing you are dragging rotates unpredictably, rather than firmly dragging them around. I suppose it fits thematically, as it is telekenesis, but from a gameplay point of view, the player doesn't feel in control. Furthermore, it usually takes a few tries to create what you want, particularly with the square blocks or triangular floating platforms (which rotate and are very unstable)Combat is plain awful. There are four main enemy types in the game, and they're all skeletons with varying abilities. You'll be seeing them throughout the whole game. What's worse is that they just keep spawning. One can spend several minutes just whacking them, as more keep spawning in, with no indication on how long until they stop spawning. You don't have a very varied move set either. It's either hold up your shield and wait for an opening with the knight, shoot an arrow at them with the theif (who cannot fire in mid-air) or hit them with a heavy object, usually with the wizard (who can't move when creating objects/using telekenesis). Enemy AI is also poor, trying to scramble over ledges, waves of monsters continually walking into a situation where they crush themselves. I admit, I played this on easy, but as far as I'm aware it only changes damage given and taken, rather than gameplay or AI.So, to give some positives, the environments are very detailed, music is fine, dialogue has some witty moments, even if the story is unmemorable.

												Trine is a great game. Lots of fun to play with a friend on your couch. Grafix are awesome, soundtracks matches the style and riddling together how to solve the levels is great.So why don't recommend the game? We just tried the last level and it has everything to kill all the fun you had before:You have to jump up a tower under time pressure as lava is rising from the ground. It's hard to not play it alone as you need to switch characters quickly. And an evil guy is conjuring items like boxes and planks right in your face. So three bad things you never got trained in all the levels before. I cannot understand how to do such a bad game design.It's a real pity, but I cannot recommend the game to anybody who doesn't like hardcore game difficulty changes. :[ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The graphics were great, gameplay was fluid, and the three characters you utilize are all diverse enough to give everyone their own style. But for some reason, The only reason I played this game -- and continued playing it to the end -- was to get it off my ""not completed"" list. I felt no push to find out what happened next, or get all the achievements, or even explore. I got the whole thing done in maybe three or four hours, and I don't imagine myself playing it any more.

												Trine is an action/puzzle platformer with 3 types of heroes, 2 types of bosses and 1 type of level.The graphics are pretty gorgeous, but unfortunately for the gameplay it's not great. There is quite a mess on screen and it's sometimes hard to tell a bonus pickup from an enemy attack.The controls - which should be the most important thing for a platformers - don't allow for enough precision and feel sloppy, which will often trigger misses. Not that it matters because the game is too easy anyway.All the levels feel exactly the same, beyond level 1 there is hardly any new mechanics, from there it's just grinding your way through. The fixed camera placement is annoying. You know objects are there but the camera won't budge or allow you to place objects outside the current field of vision.There are just 2 bosses, they're not epic, just merely a slightly tougher foe, and they come back several times in later levels.Not much variety in enemies either, it's just the same skeletons from the beginning to the end.All in all, this is just like playing the same level 15 times over again, with a different backdrop.I can appreciate some may be drawn by the medieval fantasy storytelling or by the luxurious backdrops. The graphics got overhauled recently with the enchanted edition and it's quite superb. One can wish the gameplay had got improved instead!			",309,115,5,41,72,1,62

												This game is terribleThe music and setting is cliched and forgettable, the plot is a joke, the only two bosses are rehashed several times and are almost identical, there's no final boss, every level and challenge is the same, casting shape spells as a wizard is unweildy (you couldn't have just allocated a shape to a unique button?). Combat is a laugh, mash the trigger button to win, every enemy is the same skeleton (spooky), the game throws an absurd number of enemies at me to complely ignore and jump over. The checkpoints enable you to cheese the game way to easily, which is kind of necessary since once your warrior dies you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck.I could go on forever about how the last two and a half hours I marathoned this game were some of the most miserable, tedious, worthless hours of my life but I'd rather pool my resources into getting past this game and hopefully enjoy the next one.

												Was a great game. Unfortunately it doesn't work on Windows 8.1 for me. Regardless of driver. Or settings. Or compatibility mode. Or adminstration rights. Or Window mode. Or anything for that matter.Worked fine on WIndows 7, but I'm not installing that for the sake of one game.Would recommend to those who do not use Windows 8.1			",229,24,2,26,20,1,26

												It was shorter then I expected, but a great game non the less. 6 hour was my time for the main story I was really playing through it lesurily though. If you're looking for a game with a good story, buy this game. If you're looking for a game with smooth controls and well thought out levels, buy this game. If you're looking for a game that you can sink many hours into, don't buy this game.7/10 TDLR: Great platformer, good graphics, runs well, very short.			",139,20,0,12,4,1,3

												Fun and challenging. There's always more than one way around a puzzle, and you'll often find yourself forcing your best character's solution. But it's a fun challenge of your creativity. Humorously, it's even more challenging playing with a friend. It adds a new element that's great fun. Local Co-op means one copy is good for both my wife and I to sit and play together. Great fun.

												When I got in on sale, then played it for the first time, I knew I had struck gold. I would have gladly paid the full price had I know how amazing this game was. This is very reminicent of the old SNES game Lost Vikings, but it is so much more. Platforming, physics, and a casual item collection process that allows you to saunter through, but will have you go back to complete.Brief Overview: Kingdom is in trouble, but you find yourself(selves) trapped together a Mage, a Thief, and a Knight. The Mage can create and levitate objects; the Thief has a grappling hook and a bow; the Knight can block anything with his sheild and deals out massive damage.Why have you not purchased this yet? 10/10			",348,86,0,92,48,1,94

												I bought this when it was on sale for about a dollar so I didn't expect much of it. Instead, what I got was one heck of a puzzle platformer that's simply drop-dead gorgeous. The game itself is simple enough for anyone to pick-up but the platforming and puzzles later on can be very challenging but the feeling of satisfaction you get from finishing those puzzle-platforming sections is just bliss.The way the game is presented is very much like a story-book with the narrator, the cutscenes and those amazing setpieces. You can seriously take a screenshot of any section of this game and it'd look like a painting worth being framed and hung on someone's lounge room!In single player, you can play as one character, either as the mage, the thief or the knight; each with their own strengths and weaknesses and you are allowed to switch as whichever character you want in order to get through a particular puzzle or platforming section. For example, the mage can conjure boxes and platforms to help you with puzzles and getting to places but is pretty useless when it comes to battle while the knight can lift heavy objects and is the main fighting force when it comes to battles. This interesting mechanic has been implemented extremely well within each level as you will be encouraged to play as all of the different classes in order to get through it and that makes for an already enjoyable game all the more enjoyable!All in all, Trine is an amazing-looking game with fantastic gameplay to boot and if it ever goes on sale again, don't hesitate and dive right in!

												""Trine""This has been the most suprising game that i have played in quite some time.I often remember those times where game developers still put gamplay on first priority and graphics second. Games that were Epic for their time, remember games like GODS on DOS, Shadow of Memories on Windows 95, games like that! games that sucked you right in and made you not even notice the minor downsides.Trine is that game this time, it offers a good old fashion platform type of gameplay with some new twists, a good old fashion story, and wonderfull graphics of this generation.Just buy the game its worth every penny :-) and then some.

												This is a fantastic game. I love its style, its art, and its gameplay.. being able to switch between three characters, each one with different habilities and of course a different personality is cool and comes really handy, even when u are not playing with friends you can still do everything, so the experience doesn't change that much...When i was about to buy it, I wasn't convinced enough... but now I'm glad I got it and i highly recommend it. I'd give it 10 out of 10 cuz i totally liked it, and im looking forward to playing what's next in this awesome game series.			",144,15,1,7,4,0,10

												Bought the 3 game deal thats on at the mo as fancied a change from usual style of games i play.Like how you can switch between 3 chars and do the puzzles your own way, which seems to often be wizard building bridges and throwing boxes at skellies :D  You can use magic with physics to balance boxes and beams to get around, throw out a grapling hook or just jump around.Game is well made, looks good and is good fun.  Well worth a tenner.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very enjoyable casual game. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good co-op experience. Neat puzzles, great artwork, though it is a bit short (lucky for you, there are sequels!)I usually use the wizard. I'd say about 30% of the stuff I place ends up in the right spot/useful, and the rest is usually on my partner's head, though I don't normally mean for that to happen. I figure that's pretty good. Other wizarding highlights include battles where your move is to spawn a box/plank and stand still while using it to whack things. Sometimes it kills them, sometimes not, sometimes things go flying off the map at speeds you never thought they could go.I'd give it 9/10. 10/10 once I figure out the fireball.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A delightful action puzzle-platformer that rewards logical problem solving skills.  More of a challenge with more players, which really encourages communication and teamplay.  The team that made this game really pulled off a lot with what they had, injecting an intriguing story onto solid game mechanics.Sometimes the physics aren't perfect, and it can lead to some stupid deaths, but the game's checkpoints are frequent so this minor technical flaw won't ruin the game for you.

												3D sidescroller with puzzles, nice story and very good graphics.Physic puzzles, a bit of thinking nice, but easy, combat. That pretty much sums it up.There is nothing i can say against this game or Trine 2.If you expected a hard sidescrollre you might not get what you want, but if you looking for a game that shows you how sidescrollers can be at their best, there you go.'nuff said.

												A very fun platformer-type game. You basically switch between 3 characters each with their own skills. As you progress you unlock various items and abilities. Even on Medium difficulty you are probably going to die a bit. My only complaint is that I was unable to stop playing til i got through the entire story. As soon as you beat a level it automatically loads the next one. Meaning the only way out is to press ESC and Quit. It made it very hard to stop playing such an awesome game haha.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A simple and succicnt way to describe this game would be Lost VIkings without the hassle of micromanaging each Viking on screen at the same time. But that doesn't do the game justive on just how much -better- that makes a game like this. You still have to manage three seperate health bars, but the ability to on the fly switch and keep the other two members of the Trine safe really makes this whole concept go. Not to mention of course the  abilities of the Trine making the puzzle platforming an enjoyable cerebral exercise that isn't a strain to complete in the simple functionality sense but in the actual solving as a puzzle should be. As impressive as it can be, one doesn't solve a rubix cube with their feet, and one shouldn't play a game with poor mechanics and controls. Trine does not suffer from these issues and infact excels in these departments.			",126,17,0,36,5,1,10

												Platforming with side perspective results in beautiful backgrounds at all time, in addition to elegantly subtle transition from darkness to light and so on as story progresses.Humorous narrative and good voice actors give giggles.Gaming atmosphere transforms from relaxing to intense as difficulty increases (manually set by the players), yet they are all equally enjoyable.And very importantly, brilliantly good soundtrack from the independent composer Ari Pulkkinen :D Much suited to the mood (in every level).Totally recommended.

												Great game. Trine is a platforming game where you play 3 characters at the same time. At any time you can switch between the knight, thief, and wizard, all of which have extremely different abilities. You will need to keep switching between these three characters to get past any obstacles in your way. The rgaphics are great, with nice, colourful, and detailed environments. The characters are pretty jokes. Nice music too. All in all if you're looking for a great 2D platformer you got to get Trine. Looking forward to playing Trine 2.			",133,21,3,12,9,0,9

												Happily surprised by the quality of this game, which is every bit as enjoyable to play as it was attractive to look at. The narration is very well done, and the story and levels are interesting, striking a good balance between enough content to be satisfying without being long enough that you risk getting fatigued.If it matters at all to you, it's very simple to get to 100% achievement on this game. Only the 'complete last level on very hard without any deaths' proved at all annoying, with it taking me perhaps 2 hours of repetitive attempts. I'm not very good though; I even had to look up some walkthroughs for experience I'd missed.I picked this game up, as well as the sequel for 90% off, which certainly made the cost-to-hours ratio of this game very much in the black.

												 Trine is a 2-d platform game with some puzzle elements. The key mechanic is that you can switch between three characters which have different abilities. A lot of the puzzles require swinging, putting weights on seesaws, pushing objects, moving objects with telekenesis, cutting ropes with arrows, etc. Each puzzle can be solved in a variety of different ways. Some puzzles can be solved with all three characters, so there is some replayability to try to go back and retry a puzzle with a different character. In general the puzzles were not very hard, but some of them are very creative and fun. Combat was a little dull since there are only two kinds of regular enemies and two kinds of boss. I got this game for a very good price and it was well worth it. It is a nice diversion, fun enough to hold your attention, not so difficult that you get frustrated. I would not pay more than five bucks for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Each character have their own specific attribute or abilities which are used for puzzle solving or finding hidden secrets. The warrior's weight can be used to move or lift objects, mage can draw boxes which can be used to climb to higher places, archer is very mobile. Only downside is no online coop only local multi.

Only thing I'll mention is that in the requirements it says ""Trine does not work on intergrated graphics cards"". This in fact is not true, at least for me anyway. I'm using Intel HD Graphics 3000 on my ASUS laptop, which is an intergrated card and I have had no issues at all, so I would say try it, if it works then you're in for a great experience.

												Trine is like a side-scrolling fairytale, it even has a calm-voiced narrator telling you about the storyline between the different levels. There are fifteen levels to jump around on, and they're all beautifully crafted and have a nice atmosphere to them. You can collect experience from the map and enemies you kill, which give your characters points to spend on their skills. The enemies are mostly easy to kill, except the bats.Screw the bats.I enjoyed the game a lot, it's fun playing as the different characters and trying to figure out the best way to approach a problem. Maybe the knight was not quite as useful as the others, but I did use him a lot when I was against a lot of enemies on very hard difficulty. Otherwise the characters all have their uses, and it works.Trine has a very unique and beautiful fairytale world, a great game to recommend for a first-time gamer.			",3,0,0,1,0,0,0

You can solve the puzzles in multiple ways - either by being skillful with the grappling hook with Zoya the thief, or building platforms using Amadeus the wizard's conjured blocks - or a mix of both. Highly recommended for the casual puzzle gamer.			",109,26,5,24,19,0,10

												Trine is probably the one of the few if not only side scrollers I can say I enjoy.  The genre as a whole as never really interested me since i can play all these other games where you can move around in different directions and pretty much do whatever.  However, this game has pretty much a lot of what i look for in games. freedom within levels, some puzzle, fighting, and a story (even though in this game the story takes a back seat), and really good gameplay.  All this to say if you like videogames give this one and hopefully the sequel a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trine is a neat side-scroller that lets the player control three different characters at any given time.  Each character has its strenghts and weaknesses and palyers have to use all three in order to fully clear each level.  Story is nice, graphics are very pretty, and controls are fun and simple.  The game does offer a challenge as players get further into the game, and there's lots of hidden areas to find.			",655,386,8,131,129,9,122

												Trine and Trine 2 are probably two games I rank in my top ten games. With beautiful scenery, fantastic music, many puzzles and just a ton of fun they hold together a top notch game. With up to 3 player Co-op the games becomes a lot more fun and challenging but stands as a single player as well, which makes the game even more challenging by itself as YOU, must do everything on your own. That doesn't mean you won't have a great time playing it alone. The gameplay flows very smoothly and has a very fluent control so you won't die by choppy, unfair deaths.The Music in the games is fantastic and beautiful which you can listen to over and over again, so I highly recommend getting the Soundtrack And Art with the games. Speaking of the art. The Art and scenery is like the music, beautiful and will make you stop in your steps as you look over the horizon in all it's glory. The puzzles, which are quite many, can be solved in many ways, from using magic to conjure up some crates to swinging from platform to platform. The Characters are very memorable and so is the Narrator (who I really like), makes you fall in into the tale of these three so much more.The enemies while do fell repetitive,is but a minor scratch to this game.So I highly recommend this Side-scroller gem, for its price as it isn't that pricey and you will enjoy every waking minute of it.So go buy this game and see what you've been missing out on.

												This is your Classic side scroller. You fight baddies, solve simple/moderatly difficult puzzles, and defeat occational bosses. For the most part its all about timing and not running out of health or energy. The puzzles are easy, and the fights arent hard, but add in a bit of fumbling to jump/move properly or position a block quickly/precisely and you run into annoyingly road-blocks/set-backs. Its not that its hard it just takes a couple more tries than would be entertaining. I recommend and do not recommend this title. Its really 50/50			",21,2,0,6,2,0,1

												A pretty physics-based platform/puzzle game. The main gimmick is the ability to switch between three protagonists. The wizard can levitate items and summon platforms and blocks. The thief can shoot arrows and use a grappling hook to swing and climb. And the knight can block with his shield and swing his sword.The game mechanics suggest that the three protagonists should be used almost equally, but the thief quickly becomes the most useful character. Her arrow spam quickly eclipses the sword as the fastest, most versatile and the safest way to kill the nearly-infinitely respawning skeletons. And her agility and the grappling hook negates many (but not all) puzzles that would have required the wizard.Oh, and the final level even makes this core problem more apparent. It's a timed climb to the top of a tower while an enemy sorcerer summons objects to hinder your way. Even if you already know how the completely scripted event goes, you're still going to need the thief to keep up with the climb.			",131,26,1,14,16,0,13

Fun physics-based environmental puzzles, albeit with a mix of enjoyable-but-frustrating boss battles.  The final sequence was also a bit questionable, although the game overall is still well worth your time.			",216,26,2,29,13,0,36

												Trine is a highly enjoyable, fantastically beautiful puzzle/platformer.  The difficulty is challenging enough to be interesting and rewarding, with multiple solutions for most of the obsticles.  The story is amusing enough threading the levels together, but isn't likely to ""wow"" you.  (I will echo another review saying that you may want to wait for it to drop in price.  I purchased it during the Summer Sale, heavily discounted.)Ultimately, it's the gameplay that will capture your interest--and a good thing, too, 'cause it's a lot of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Anybody remember The Lost Vikings, made by Blizzard in the 90s? Trine is its great-great-grand nephew in spirit. You control three distinct characters with unique abilities between which you can and must switch to get through the gorgeous 2D levels (and I really mean gorgeous). It is heavily fairytale-themed with a deep-voiced narrator and playful artwork, but beneath that is a stunning game of physics and combination. Frozenbyte has made clear with this one that they are one of today's most innovative and creative game studios. Trine simply is a masterpiece.			",180,23,4,34,12,1,71

												Not so brilliant like Trine 2, but still very good. In comparison. Char controls aren't so responsive. Artifact system is excess. Not all of levels are so marvelous for eyes — style is darker & more gothic. Although storytelling maybe more thorough than in Trine 2. Anyway this is Trine, great platformer with nice graphics, nice soundtrack, simple but exciting gameplay & in atmosphere of fairytale.upd: Trine Enchanted Edition more close to Trine 2 beauty than original Trine.

												Great little platformer game, especially with its awesome artwork. The story starts out pretty good, but seemingly loses its point before the end of the game, which is unfortunate. Thankfully, the controls are smooth and work well with a keyboard. The ability to use all three characters to your advantage is an interesting feature, as they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Although, I would say Zoya (The Thief) is the go-to character as it is much easier to navigate with the use of her grapple hook. Pontius (The Knight) is great for dispatching groups of enemies at a time, especially bats once you gain access to a ground smash later in the game. Amadeus (The Mage) is able to fully skip a majority of the puzzles once fully upgraded and with heavy use of his spawned crates and planks, which is nice if you've been through the game once over. I wouldn't particuarly say the game has much replay value though beyond a second runthrough on Very Hard (If achievements and harder difficulties are your thing) as it does not have anything else to offer except being able to play with all of your previously acquired upgrades. There were also a few times that I encountered my use of attacks not actually working as they should which became a bit of nuisance. Overall, I would recommend the game to someone if they are looking for a platformer to waste a bit of time on. The game has its own feel to the genre because of the use of three characters, so it's not inherently like any other platformer that comes to mind. It is worth its price point, but is even better if you are able to get it on sale in the package along with its sequel.			",96,8,0,8,5,1,5

												""Charming"" is probably the single best word to describe this side-scrolling puzzle-platformer. Attractive graphics and a great soundtrack highlight a strong physics system that makes the way you solve its puzzles the focus, rather than the solutions themselves. Fans of super hard platformers a la Meat Boy and those hoping for extremely complex puzzle elements will likely be disappointed with the relatively low level of difficulty. The lack of combat depth and variety of enemies are the game's weakest points, but it knows its limits and doesn't spend too much time on either.

												A fun, but short, puzzle platformer. You switch between three different characters with their own abilities, the Knight, who is focused on close-quarters combat, the Thief, which can swing between platforms and shoot enemies with her bow, and the Wizard, who can conjure boxes and platforms to reach new areas. Lots of fun. Buy it if it goes on sale.			",132,33,1,15,11,0,9

												(somewhat rushed for Summer Sale Cheevo's) I truly dig the twee vibe you may well get from the screen shots. It can get more complicated than that (platform creating, ninja roping) and theres a lot of clever stuff the game does do and that you can do, but theres no need to if you'd prefer to clumsily muddle through and see the lovingly created settings, that's fine too. The baddies (and that's as near as damn singular) do get tiresome and do seem to be there to lengthen the campaign without stopping you, but all the same the design just work perfect for me, give it a look.

												[PRO]If you like The Lost Vikings probably you will like Trine, the system is very similar.Characters:-	The Thief is a versatile char, very agile, she use the grappling rope and bow and arrow, if you combine certain items and skills the Thief can turn the most powerful char, firing 4 deadly arrows-	The Warrior is pure “hack n’ slack”, he use the sword, shield and a hammer, with sword you can destroy many things and with hammer you can crush everything-	The Wizard is your life-saver, he create boxes, planks, floating triangles and move things with telekinesis, if you use smart the Wizard, you can save your life (cover the spikes with boxes) and get many items, if you get in troubles with the monsters you can drop the box in their headsDifficulty:-	Is very balanced!

												Trine is a cute little 2D platformer, with some puzzle elements. The setting is wonderful, with vivid visuals and a great narrator. There are also plenty of achievements and items to collect, if that is your thing. The whole game feels complete, with only a few minor annoyances. The difficulty is well-balanced, if not a tad too easy on lower settings. Good timekiller, well worth the eight yurops.			",82,15,2,11,8,0,11

												An amazing game.  I managed to pick up Trine and Trine 2 in a double pack sale months ago and I can say that I haven't been disappointed.  While the action sometimes seems a little slow, that isn't what this game is about.  Each map can be completed a number of different ways and in order to do so...you need to think.  Do you want to use the armor clad knight?  Prefer the agile rogue?  Or would you like to construct platforms with an arcane wizard?  Pick one, and dominate the game of Trine.  It is way to fun to pass up.  Definately worth a buy.			",51,7,0,11,7,0,3

												A good action / puzzle platformer. The mechanics, abilities, character customization with trinkets found in levels is solid, well executed and good gameplay. Overall it is a great game mechanically, but I found myself not that engaged or motivated to play it. I would imagine it is more hectic and engaging while playing local co-op, but I was playing singleplayer. Story is ok, but perhaps it was the linear level design that is constantly pushing the player in one direction. With other side scrolling platforming games with large open worlds, like Aquaria and 1000 volts, there is a sense of exploration and amusement at discovering new things and secrets. In level based platformers like this one, it's more of a get to the end level (Repeat until game is done). Yes there is exploration throughout the level, but it just doesn't engage in the same way. TL;DR : Good platformer, better with friends - beat levels, collect things.			",264,52,5,16,12,0,20

												Trine... This game is amazing. So magic and beautiful. Magnificent story about Good and Evil. Story about dark times of an ancient Kingdom. Story about three Heroes standing against Greater Evil. And even our Heroes have their own story. Well, I can't tell more, you need to try it by yourself. You can't even imagine how this game is fascinating. And besides the plot, Trine has a very interesting gameplay. Each character has it's own mechanics. And it's cool to combine them together. I've completed this game twice. First, I've completed it in my old account some years ago, it was before Trine 2. Played with mouse and keyboard. Have done all achievements. And kept this memories in a comfortable place in my heart. And second, completed it few hours ago. Played Enchanted Edition with my Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller. Also, have done all achievements. Renewed my memories with this new beautiful edition of this game. Well done, developers! It's very hard to make the masterpiece better, but you did it! And thanks for Bats, never liked them. :D They were really annoying on hardest difficulty. BTW, completed this game on Hard (Hardcore). Trine is really challenging, if you want to try yourself. :) Okay, I think I need to end my review here. But I'll return with Trine 2, when I'll get all achievements in it. Don't miss me.

												Imagine if Dungeons & Dragons, Portal, Super Mario Brothers 3, and Donkey Kong Country all got thrown into a blender and set to an epic orchesta score written by Harry Gregson Williams and the result would be Trine.  This is a great physics platformer with amazing detail and very fluint controls.  The story is on the level of depth as Mario (i.e. princess captured, go save) but you'll hear no complaint out of me.  Only legitimate complaint I have is the low variety of enemies but each of the 15 levels has it's own theme, background, atmosphere, and well written musical score to complete the mood of each realm you explore so you hardly notice.  The music really is so great that I have the soundtrack on my MP3 player, no joke.  The actions flow seemlessly, weapon upgrades acutally progress at the same rate as the difficulty curve, and you'll keep coming back so you can find everything.  This is the best $20 you'll spend on a game this year, promise.			",63,6,0,5,3,2,4

												Do I recommend this game? Psshhh no.... Ok. That was hard to say. Of course I recommend this game. I am not one to play platform style games... However I do love a good puzzle. This game provides not only great quick-thinking puzzles but also is the best platformer I have ever played. Yes, it is quite short time wise but who says you cant play through again on higher difficulty. If your'e not into that kind of thing... Get Trine 2. I have yet to try the second one but seeing at how impressive the first is... Trine 2 will be on my wish list. Trine is/was more than worth the 0.99$ I spent on it. It provided much more entertainment than I ever expected. It frustrated me at times but that was because I was trying to play quickly. Though this game isn't new by any means you can not really tell how old it is while playing. To be completely honest, it felt like I was playing a much more modern game. The graphics in this game aren't phenomenal but the atmosphere is. (The graphics are amazing DO NOT get me wrong). So all that said... I certainly recommend this game. I couldnt recommend it more.(BTW All you haters that choose Not To Recommend... Please do it for more of a legitimate reason than the fact that you can't get past a level)**Kudos to Frozenbyte for this outstanding game**			",152,10,3,12,14,1,9

												I bought this game for 4€ due to a steam coupon and it was totally worth it. It's a nice platforming where you can controll 3 different ""heroes"" with different abilities. What I really liked about this game was that you can solve the different puzzles on different ways according to your playstyle (mage,rogue or warrior) especially when you progress in the game and achieve more abilities.Although I liked this game, I thought it was way to easy. I played it the first time on ""medium"" and did it all on the first try (except the last level where I needed like 3 trys) and you can't really die due to the checkpoint system. Even on the difficulty ""Very Hard"" it was still very easy in my opinion but this might be due to my full-leveled heroes. The game has various achievements like exploring (finding all experience bottles in the levels) and ""fun"" achievements like jumping on 5 different skeletons; a good mix in my opinion.Finally, you can beat this game in like 7-8 hours when you play it the first time and like to explore the levels to find the experience flasks which are very nicely hidden and it's fun to explore the levels.

For a side-scrolling-platforming-puzzler it is quite the game, giving you a new sense of adventure with its epic graphics for a 2009 game, and great point-and-click gameplay. 100% Would recommend to anyone who is hesitant about it. But if it is between Trine or Trine 2, go for Trine 2. The story is pretty interesting, but you can sorta live without it.			",34,7,0,11,2,0,3

												10/10. The most beautiful platform game I've ever played. It plays 2D, but is rendered in gorgeous 3D. The music is awesome, and I obtained the soundtrack even before purchasing the game itself. The game play is quite possibly the best I've seen in a 2D platform game. Objects and enemies use  Nvidia PhysX engine and there are multiple ways to defeat enemies and navigate obstacles. You play 3 classes all at the same time, each with unique abilities. The Wizard conjures objects, the Thief uses a grappling hook and archery, and the Knight uses a sword and shield.			",178,147,1,34,11,1,17

												This is a fantastic game. I love its style, its art, and its gameplay.. being able to switch between three characters, each one with different habilities and of course a different personality is cool and comes really handy, even when u are not playing with friends you can still do everything, so the experience doesn't change that much...When i was about to buy it, I wasn't convinced enough... but now I'm glad I got it and i highly recommend it. I'd give it 10 out of 10 cuz i totally liked it, and im looking forward to playing what's next in this awesome game series.			",144,15,1,7,4,0,10

												This game is fantastic! It is beautiful to say the least, as each level is masterfully designed and gorgeously rendered, making this the biggest draw for the game. The gameplay is very sound, mixing together traditional platforming with physics-based puzzles to create a somewhat unique experience that falls just short of the high bar set by the game's graphics. The player can switch between the Wizard, Theif, and Warrior at will when playing in single-player mode, or play alongside up to two friends in local co-op (though why there is no online co-op is beyond me).I would say that the only real drawback to this game is that it's pretty short. I took my time with the game and ended up completing the main story within 3 hours. Luckily, there are bonus levels, higher difficulties, collectibles, and a level-up system that helps lessen the blow of the lack of content in the main story, and provides at least a little bit of replayability.All in all, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a good platformer, and smart puzzle game, or just wants something beautiful to look at. Right now, the game only costs $0.99, so hop on this bandwagon before that sale ends! I give this game 4.5 out of 5 stars.			",37,4,1,3,0,0,1

												Trine is a magical game. Not only does it have magic in it, but it feels like it's made of magic.The moment you start playing it, the voice of the narrator, the sounds of the forests and the bright colors of the dungeons will enchant you like when you were a little kid and got your first kiss. :) Ok, a kiss is a kiss and can't be compared to a game, but it's close to it.It's hard to know what to like the most in Trine. It could be the well designed levels, or the animations of the characters, or it could be the physics engine and how the characters are unique in each way. It could also be the amount of fun that you can have with your family or it could be the relaxing music that makes you forget the outside world and simply relax.There's a whole lot of things to do in Trine and the replay value can be huge, especially if you're playing the game with someone else. Trine 2 is on the rise, so why don't you see what the fuzz is all about?			",1928,780,68,252,241,17,344

												Trine is a fairly short but beautiful game.  It isn't really challenging and the story lacks any big luster.  However, I think it's worth buying.  You get to control 3 heroes, each with unique abilities.  While linear, you have the option of getting to the end of each level with the help of each hero, in whatever way works for you.The wizard can summon platforms, the thief has an awesome hookshot, and the warrior... well, he can take on multiple enemies.  The game has a classical fantasy theme that works really well.  However, I think there should've been more character narrative during each level, just to build a bit of a relation between each hero.The gameplay really has a Lost Vikings theme to it, with each hero having key moments in order to advance further.  The music is pretty good but not too memorable as opposed to other games I've played.  This said, I still think this is a unique game based off the gameplay.  Still buying the sequel!3/5 Rating			",182,21,0,31,7,0,19

												Trine looks great, even in 2012. The levels are all beautifully designed (you'll rarely see rather generic set pieces) and hold unique aesthetics. The game is really plays with colours a lot. At core Trine is a simple jump and run game with physics puzzles added. If you're skilled, you'll be able to skip many of the physics puzzles, but I don't see this as a negative aspect. You are able to choose if you want to solve a puzzle or skip it. The soundtrack is amazing! The game really develops a great fantasy atmosphere. The additional challenges (e.g. finding all experience and secret treasures) are fun and mostly doable without having to look at online guides. And while you will need to switch between all 3 characters (which play quite differently), the thief seems to be overpowered. I found myself playing with her most of the time. It took me roughly 6-8 hours to finish Trine and around 17 hours to get all the achievements.			",207,58,7,31,27,1,37

												Trine is a side-scroller puzzle and action game with a beautiful atmoshpere and level design. If you enjoy stuff like this, then you'll definetly enjoy this. The puzzles can be challenging and fun, and the art style keeps you immersed in this world. There is Co-Op in the game, and it is a fun game to play with friends, and requires team-work, because each character has different abilites needed for the adventure. The game is about 9 hours long,  and it is very worth it. I'd say wait for it to be on sale and buy it once it's $10 or $15. It's a fun game with good amounts of content to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rating: FantasticTraditional Rating: 9.8/10Type: Platformer/Puzzles/CombatDetails: I have to recommend this game to everyone even considering buying it. While it's only a few hours of play, the game is stunningly beautiful with a solid story (Including an awesome narrator) and great gameplay mechanics allowing players to traverse each section in a multitude of ways using any of the three characters available. I found myself continually coming back to this game until it was finally finished, and once it was, I picked up Trine 2 almost immediatly.If you are considering this game for your next purchase, I have to highly recommend you turn that ""maybe"" to a ""yes"". You wont be disappointed.			",121,18,1,14,14,0,13

												While playing I had a love and hate relationship with it, a lot of times it made me angry, but at the end I quite liked this 2D platformer/puzzle game.  The game has the most generic medieval fantasy setting you can imagine, but its really colorful and on high settings looks really great. Music also is generic, but fits well with the game. Story isn't anything really new and original. But I guess the most important part of this game is game-play. Each character has its own unique skills and abilities, so it makes game more interesting. Puzzles are a bit challenging and can be solved in more than one way. Platforming is challenging too, but at least for mouse and keyboard, controls felt really sensitive, and in some parts, made game really hard, where you had to make really precise jumps or landings, maybe with controller it's different. Game is definitely worth it's price, and if you are into this kind of thing, than be sure to try out! I gave it 8,1.			",166,21,9,15,9,1,23

												Not only is this game AMAZINGLY PRETTY, the gameplay is solid and the puzzles are just challenging enough. However, you can bypass a lot of them by using your wizard to build insane stacks of magical boxes, planks and platforms, which is a load of fun in itself. Have I mentioned it is very beautiful yet?

												I played this little gem early on, and I was truly amazed at the beauty of the game. The environments and music are nothing short of breathtaking, this game is truly a work of art. That being said, dont' expect much from the enemies, as there are only 2-3 different enemies in the entire game. Despite its drawbacks, it is well worth the money and I would highly recommend it.

												This game is pretty fun to play through. The graphics are absolutely stunning. I’ve never seen such beautiful detail in a game before. It makes you want to go off and explore more than the 2D platform you are stuck in. What makes this game an interesting platformer is that you can instantly switch between your 3 characters, even during a fight. I also like how the made isn’t just a third form of combat that you have to use. The ranger and knight are both useful for fighting and the mage is mainly there to help with the physics challenges and obstacles. There are also some skills that you can upgrade and a few items to find. Other than that, there’s not too much to the game, you just press forward to get through the levels. It’s nice that there are frequent checkpoints in case you die, but you have to start at the beginning of the level if you quit the game. Overall, it’s a pretty relaxing experience with the scenery and music with peppered with a few physics-related challenges and an occasional maze-like area to work through.			",45,13,0,8,11,1,6

												Trine is one of those games that decided it didn't need to be mature, bloody and violent to be a successful game. While this is true, it can also hamper a game if it swings too far in the other direction and becoming childish. This is the problem I had with Trine's story. The characters and storytelling are all presented as if in a 5 year-old's bedtime story. If I were a child, I'm sure the story wouldn't have bothered me as much, but because I am not, I found the game to be much less immersive than it could have been.However, Trine does deserve credit for it's gameplay. The level design is fantastic and challenging, regardless of what settings you play on. The characters each have unique strengths and abilities which allow creative puzzle-solving in the form of platforming through seemingly impassable areas. Each character is very balanced and the ability to switch between them is  just flat out cool. Also, the visuals of the game are unique and nicely rendered. While not necessarily the most realistic, the art style is certainly worthy of praise.All in all, Trine is a fun, albeit short, game with a story that just feels a little to young for me. Certainly worth giving it a playthrough, but not really all that substantial of a game.			",91,5,0,14,5,2,4

												Good platformer with great visuals, flow and play.  Its mared only by the slightly inaccurate collision detection and momentum for jumps (which you do alot), there is no 'just' making a jump, and often you will look like you made the jump only for it to 'bounce' you into a failling it.  Given the attention to detail on everything else, it makes it all the glaring.Dispite that though its still fun enough to continue on with.			",110,31,1,28,5,0,27

												It takes a lot of skill to make a game that plays just as well, if not better, co-operatively as it does with just a single player.  Trine excels in both situations.Whereas the Shadowgrounds series was dark and broody, Trine is almost its exact opposite.  This game is bright, vibrant, and colorful.  The fairy-tale fantasy world you’ll be exploring is full of beautiful detail.  Wooden planks will creak under your weight, flowing lava will bubble and spurt menacingly, and leaves will rustle in the wind as you run by.  The story here is simplistic, but well-told by a very good narrator, who almost sounds as if he is reading you a bedtime story.  The three characters you control have their own endearing personalities, and it is easy to become attached to them throughout the adventure.When a Thief, a Wizard, and a Knight all happen across the same ancient artifact, it binds their souls together into one.  They now are forced to travel together in order to figure out what is causing the undead plague ravaging the kingdom.  The journey consists mostly of platforming and combat, with precious experience potions and treasure chests hidden behind devious traps and puzzles.  You will need to utilize all three characters’ strengths in order to succeed, as they are each very unique.  The Thief can grapple to any wooden surface and swing through the air, allowing you to quickly skip huge sections of a level.  The Wizard can create boxes, and then planks, and then platforms, by drawing shapes in the air with your mouse.  The Knight is a master of combat, and can also use his huge hammer to break or shove objects.  Each character is unique and useful in different situations, and as a single player you’ll be able to switch between them freely.But the game really shines when you add two more people to the mix.  Then you all play at the same time, but you are locked into your specific character.  A gap that was simple for the Thief to simply swing right over becomes a devious puzzle for the more land-bound Knight.  The difficulty really ramps up when you cannot just carry each character along, and that is great.  You really have to communicate and work through the solutions together with your partners, and the game tends to go slower as a result, but it feels more rewarding.  This is the ideal way to play the game, and the systems here really shine when you master them along with two other adventurers.The soundtrack supports the game really well, and you can tell that Frozenbyte’s Ari Pulkkinen has improved his skills over time.  The plucky, etherial soundtrack lends itself well to the fairy tale aesthetic of the game, and is backed up well by truly outstanding voice acting.  The aforementioned Narrator is a welcome companion on your quest, introducing each stage and major event that leads to the final showdown.Yet the visuals are easily the standout quality of this game.  Just look at these screenshots, and imagine how alive everything feels!  (Even though you’re surrounded by undead skeletons)  The backgrounds are vibrant and full of detail.  Every level feels unique and different setpieces are always being introduced.  From a dragon graveyard to a twisted forest, from the depths of an abandoned mine to an ancient temple; no two levels look the same.Trine is a great game.  The completionist in me loved searching for every experience potion and hidden treasure chest on every stage, working my way through these well-crafted puzzles.  The last level has a bit of a ridiculous difficulty spike compared to the rest of the game, but I’ll forgive that minor quibble.  This game gave me a dozen hours or so of beautiful platforming action.			",302,110,8,54,32,6,75

TL;DRTrine Enchanted Edition is a well paced game with great visuals and performance, enchanting atmosphere and narrative, but with a sometimes lacklustre and repetitive soundtrack with puzzles that leave more to be desired.ReviewThe GoodTrine Enchanted Edtion, is a 2D Puzzle Platformer that has a rather bewitching feeling to it.The narrative (literally) is given by a warm, booming voice that provides a charismatic experience when playing.The story itself can be dull at times; being predictable to some sense with your typical heroes and villains.The accompanying soundtrack fits the game extremely well, but feels repeated or too similar to the other soundtracks in the game and can become dull. Take this with a grain of salt, because while some exceptional game soundtracks can be very noticeable for good reasons, the majority of the time you are focusing on the gameplay.However, the graphics/art style is a completely different story. With what one might consider a rather charming design, Trine Enchanted Edition has impressed me with what looks like a very imaginative design. Whether you are speedrunning or stopping for a second to edit your inventory, nearly every single menu and environment you are in looks incredible.The BadHowever, Trine has its flaws.Aside from the sometimes predictable story and repetitive soundtrack, there are a few more personal ticks.Coming from CSGO, where I can skip through menus by spamming the escape key or the enter key, isn't the case in Trine.During loading/story cutscenes, there is the option to skip the scene or click a start button when it has ended.By instinct I press the enter key, but that doesn't do anything and I have to specifically click a tiny button in the lower middle of the screen.This becomes really frustrating sometimes, especially when I'm busy taking a sip of a drink or something and just want to start the next area without having to put down my drink.Yet again, take this with a grain of salt as these are personal gripes and do not affect the gameplay itself and will likely not affect many people.After going through all of these elements and shortcomings of Trine Enchanted Edition, it is still an enjoyable and solid game to play.The ScoreOverall, I give this game a well earned 7.5/10 ",104,10,2,4,10,1,4

												I rarely play platformers, but Trine is simply great. Delightful atmosphere, nice graphics (side scrolling 3D, looks beautiful), great voice over. A controller is strongly recommended. Local coop is super fun; I am not sure how difficult is it if you play alone, but two players can cooperate very well (both players can switch to the unused third character as well). My wife and I completed it in about 10 hours on Easy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A decent game, though a little short.Only 15 Levels (one bonus)I found the majority of the game Easy, up until Level 14 where it was suddenly super hard.Then level 15 was a challenge but all in all, got through it rather quickly.Beautiful level design (though a little repetitive)Great soundtrack. Lots of treasures to find, new weapons and such.All in all, a decent game. Worth the small price it is.Likely much more enjoyable with friends playing too.			",97,10,2,13,4,1,5

												Imagine if Dungeons & Dragons, Portal, Super Mario Brothers 3, and Donkey Kong Country all got thrown into a blender and set to an epic orchesta score written by Harry Gregson Williams and the result would be Trine.  This is a great physics platformer with amazing detail and very fluint controls.  The story is on the level of depth as Mario (i.e. princess captured, go save) but you'll hear no complaint out of me.  Only legitimate complaint I have is the low variety of enemies but each of the 15 levels has it's own theme, background, atmosphere, and well written musical score to complete the mood of each realm you explore so you hardly notice.  The music really is so great that I have the soundtrack on my MP3 player, no joke.  The actions flow seemlessly, weapon upgrades acutally progress at the same rate as the difficulty curve, and you'll keep coming back so you can find everything.  This is the best $20 you'll spend on a game this year, promise.			",63,6,0,5,3,2,4

												Very fun game.  Has excellent graphics and visuals, the narration of the story also wasn't too bad either.  The game mechanics are very fun though.  You control 1 of 3 hero's at any given time, and each one has specific abilities to deal with various obstacles in your path.  It's more of a side-scrolling puzzle type game.  There is some combat, but most of the game is trying to figure out how to get from point A to point B.  I would highly recommend it for those who are looking for more of a puzzle side-scroller rather then hack and slash action.			",200,26,0,49,7,0,31

												Addictive platform/puzzle game. The bodies of a wizard, a knight and a thief get fused together and you have to control them, switching between one of the three at will, on quest to save the kingdom and separate themselves. The wizzard can move objects telekenetically and conjure platforms, boxes etc, the thief has a bow and grappling hook you can swing from and the knight is a hand-to-hand fighter. You need to collect experience vials as you go which are hidden in hard to reach places which require some thought and a combination of the character's skills to get to. Trine 2 seems to be more of the same.			",738,214,18,106,95,7,151

												Trine is a side scrolling platform game in which you play three protaganists a wizard, a thief and a soldier, whose souls have somehow been gathered together by the Trine. To complete game you need to complete the levels, collecting experience to gain better weapons or skills is of use you do this be collecting bottles that are laying around or hidden, or by killing monsters and collecting the experience. Also lying around are energy bottles to top up your energy which the wizard seems to use a great deal more than the other characters (at least in the levels I have played any how.)The idea pf three souls together  has the benefit that you can swap at anytime between the different characters if one character has a skill to solve that the others do not. This makes it interesting as you move between them to complete the different levels. So soon learn which character is best for the upcoming task. For me the Graphics make it stand out, the environment is beautifully drawn which makes it a real pleasure to play. There is a great deal of jumping about and I sometimes find it hard to control using the keyboard; especially the thief when she is trying to get onto a platform from the grappling rope. I think a game controller would  make it a bit easier, I am going to try this to see if is indeed true. The default movement controls are the standard WASD controls perhaps if you wish to use the keyboard to play, redefining the keys could also improve things.Another positive aspect of the game is the narration which makes you feel you are creating the book as you go along. The music also adds to the atmosphere quite well.During the hours I've played I've lost a character because they ran out of health many, many times. If you feel you wish to start over. You can choose from the menu to either start from the last checkpoint or restart the level. Restarting from the last checkpoint doesn't reset the monsters and puzzles that you've completed whilst restarting the level does reset the puzzles and monsters. However collected experience is retained by you upon the restart so during the restart you will only see the experience you haven't collected, so far.I thoroughly recommend Trine and I will continue with Trine2 once I've completed Trine.

												What to say about Trine...genius? perfect? Maybe. Trine is platforming at it's greatest. There is no one specific way to solve the game's puzzles. Also, the entire thing can be played 3 player co-op either online, via LAN or on the same PC provided you have some spare controllers or an extra mouse and keyboard. That's what makes Trine and Trine 2 absolute gold; working together with your friends (or hindering them) is absolutely a blast.Just go play the series with a friend or two and you'll see what I mean.

And this is an Indie development team that are making great games. The little price of $14.99 for such a great game and helping them create more games like this that inspire other franchizes and video game companies to make better games. You buying this game helps this team in every way to make other great games, like Trine 3 and many more.			",81,14,1,7,7,0,5

												This is an absolutely brilliant game for a casual multiplayer session with a couple of friends.First of all, I'm not sure I'd play it singleplayer, as the storyline is lacklustre (something about magic and an ancient artefact, I think) and the gameplay laborious. but add another player and that's where it really shines. It plays like a platformer/puzzler hybrid and two or three players combining the different abilities of the characters makes for endless fun.Secondly, play with an Xbox controller (or similar). The keyboard/mouse controls are not so great, but it's really fluid with a controller - and this is coming from a PC gamer who has almost never used a gamepad.Essentially this game has you (and/or your friends) as a wizard (with abilities to conjour boxes etc), a knight (with a sword and magical shield) and a thief (with a grappling hook and bow). All of these abilities are well bnalanced, and you will find yourself having to use all three characters as you work around the puzzles in your way. There might be any number of solutions to a given puzzle, so it's worth trying all the characters.Finally, this game has recieved a graphical overhaul and looks absolutely beautiful. The 'theme' is a very colourful fairytale look, with locations from enchanted forests with colourful flowers, giant leaves and massive snails to underground caverns with glowing crystals and bottomless pits. It's essentially a 2.5D game (3D animation in a 2D plane), but don't let that put you off - the backgrounds and lighting are very impressive.Definitely a 9/10 - loses the one point for the weak storyline and crazy boss level, but it's still a really fun game. Definitely worth picking up.			",41,2,2,2,2,0,6

												Wizard: uses blunt object to solve all his problems. Puzzles, walls, skeletons, you name it.Knight:  conjures the power of lightning and fire and gravity to crush his opponents to dust.Yeeaah I didn't have it the other way around.This game is friggin beautiful. THE BOXES ARE PRETTY I CARRY ALL OF THEM AS FAR IN THE LEVEL AS I CAN.no really, the visuals are 10/10. there's this one point where there's a dark place with only a singles source of light, and putting a clockwork box close to it would cast a beautifully moving shadow in the background and I just lost it. visuals 10/10the wizard: is hilarious xD he can only make boxes and that's it. but hey, if you look at the top of this review you'll know what's so fun about it. sometimes tho, you will end up gently caressing the skeleton with a box. which is really awkward. there's also the skeleton doing parkour on your boxes and he starts looking really cool. Did I mention, skeletons look hella bad♥♥♥♥♥smashing clockwork boxes you make.verdict: wizard is the best character in the game. he's pretty much the strongest if you use him right. if you don't he makes your enemies look really cool tho.knight (see top, he's awesome when he gets there)thief:grappling hook at nearly half the game constructs. that should be enough fun for you.enemies aren't too varied tho. or maybe that's just what it seems to me since theyz all skeletons.the obstacles are pretty easy xD with more than one possible solution, and each obstacle holds  a single common solution which is a stack of boxes. boxes aside, the obstacles are very diverse, and you wouldn't be bored of solving them with boxes. think onepunch man(i mean saitama is pretty bored but dude the people watching that thing sure as hell aren't).that last part was a bit anti-climatic tho :c which is sad. It sorta leaves you wanting for more, and wanting more to smash. WHICH IS NOT BAD FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE TRINE 2 on fam share! (buying this game on sale is strongly reccomended)TLDR: the game is really amazing, yet leaves much to be desired. more enemies for example.			",58,18,0,7,6,1,5

												You only have to look for a split second to tell a lot of love went into this game. Trine is very good platformer albeit a little on the easy side. I recommend buying it. ProsThe music and sound design is outstanding; the title screen track is particularly fitting.The animations are up to par.Graphics are vibrant and detailed. They create the right atmosphere.Controls are responsive, which is nice in a platform game ;)ConsMediocre story, but that didn't really bother me. It ties the game together and does the job, but nothing special.Even on very hard, the game is not hard at all.The puzzles are very self explanatory.Leveling/special item system could use a little more depth.

												Admittedly I haven't played this game for very long (though I would say a little longer than the 4 hours Steam claims; silly, buggy timer). However, this is one of the many games that I purchased ages ago and never got around to playing... until today. Yesterday. Whatever. When finally I did boot it up, I felt so stupid for having waited so long. This is seriously great fun. At Normal difficulty, it's fairly casual with a few challenges, and I like that it makes you think. It might be linear, but there are different ways to go around your obstacles, and they're all fun.			",25,22,0,13,3,0,2

												Picked up the Trine collection in the christmas sale for a very small price! It was worth every penny and more, i was hooked on this game from start to finish! A nice mix of side scrolling/action/roleplaying elements, well worth the investment, can't wait to tackle Trine 2! Not the longest game in the world but plenty of fun, if you wanted to collect all the achievments it will take a little longer to complete, but my first play through came in around 7 hours!

												I highly recommend Trine. I plugged in my 360 controller, and it was well configured. I have beat the game in just over 9 hours. It was incredibly fun, and I might re-play through it another time. I got it on sale for just $0.99, but I'd say it's worth the $9.99 price tag.If anyone is contemplating getting Trine, I'd say get it, it's definitely worth your time.			",171,26,4,18,13,0,7

												A buddy of mine recommended this game to me as a ""puzzle game"". I thought meh...puzzles... But I bought it anyway and I played through the game in a single session... So worth it... One of the best games I have ever played, hands down.Skill tree is awesome. Inventory is kinda useless and I never really botherd with it, but it's a nice addition.I don't like the mana part, but that doesn't get in your way at all pretty much.TLDR: 10/10 would buy again.

												This side-scrolling action platformer puzzle adventure game just shows how much the genre hasn't died yet, even if it is gone from consoles for now. This game harkens back to the 16bit era of video games in a magical way. Control one of three types of characters that you can switch between, the thief, wizard or knight to solve puzzles and defeat your enemies. Each character offers a unique set of skills for your adventure to solve puzzles and overcome enemies. The major down sides of Trine are minor in comparison, it does not support xbox controller well, as is very buggy when using it. The other more pressing issue with Trine is the lack of an engaging story, though the gameplay of Trine more than makes up for it.			",387,115,1,96,62,3,65

												Think of Trine as a modern Super Mario Game.You have Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach as Playable Characters (Knight, Wizard, Thief).Instead of jumping off the enemies you can slash and smash them, shoot arrows at them, and even throw objects at them.Then there are annoying obstacles, puzzles that makes you think for a second and there is NO TIME LIMIT!What's more is that you can choose Hardcore Mode as difficulty once you've finished the game!So if you are looking for more challenge I really recommend this game!

												TRINE IS NOT MADE FOR SINGLE PLAYERPros:-Fun and interestic platforming with plenty of unique puzzles-Great soundtrack-3 Player Co-Op-Looks nice-Decent story-Clever level designCons:-Very short-Trine was made for multiplayer. Single player is incredibly easy and allows you to skip over a majority of the puzzles with ease.-Knight felt useless to me-I personally thought the voice acting suckedOverall: If you have 2 other friends who have this game, buy it, it will be worth your money. Otherwise, leave it alone, single player is short and easy. It was pretty disappointing to me. Trine is certainly not a bad game, in fact, it's an excellent game.

Didn't find any glaring bugs either, so kudos to the developers for a well-done job.Overall an 8/10 (losing some points for not having that much content, played it for 10 hours to get almost all achievements).

												Although Trine is short enough that I finished it in 6 hours, I can easily imagine spending much more on completionism. This game had tons of workarounds and side items to grab that kept the gameplay enjoyable even when the puzzles were trying my patience. The world is gorgeous, the soundtrack is amazing, and the physics are impeccable. Also, the game is lighthearted enough that even a casual gamer would enjoy it very much.			",107,28,2,23,8,1,9

												Really good game. Even at hard, the game is forgiving with a good balance in checkpoints. You really must play this carefully by finding the chests with skills and collecting XP to be able to upgrade your skills. Otherwise you will not be able to complete the game. The story is OK, but not necessary to follow. Gameplay is good and switching between characters is a must and gives the game a little extra.Do mind that you're better of with this than Trine 2!!

												Two friends of mine boght this game with me to have  a little of coop fun. The game was more or less mediocre. The puzzles were way to easy and the games was way to short.We played trough it in about 5 hours, which i consider to be too short for a game that originally cost 20€ or maybe even more. The artstyle of the game ist fabulous and it was fun to play all in all. ",20,3,0,5,0,0,0

												This game is very good looking and relaxing when you want to escape from the action games.I belive trine is better than the other 2 games and i would recommend playing it first before you play the others.pros-the graphics are good-the gameplay is awsome -it has co-op online/split screen-the story tellers voice is just awsomecons-sometimes it can be very exhausting-for some reason cutscenes are 30 fps (that may hurt your eyes) ",41,4,0,1,0,0,1

												Grabbed this on the advise of a friend and i'm certainly not disappointed, the game was a blast, played the first few levels solo then did the whole thing with said friend. Finished it in about 5 hours (though we missed a fair few collectables). The characters are very interesting and the gameplay with each one is fluid and unique, Playing older levels again with newer powers can be a lot of fun since it allows you to cheese the mechanics hehehe. I played the game with the max 100 at very high settings. Perfect game (and series) to grab if you need a co-op game to play with friends or just a fun game to play solo.			",43,0,0,6,3,0,3

												TL:DR an enjoyable casual platformer that should give you a few hours of funThis is a pretty enjoyable casual side scrolling platformer where you can switch between 3 different characters at the press of a button. The 3 characters are the knight, wizard and thief with each having different abilities. The knight has a sword for attacking enemies and can block attacks and projectiles from enemies and traps. The wizard can move objects like blocks and crates using magic as well as summon crates and bridges. The thief has a bow and arrow for attacking and a grappling hook to swing with. The level design is great and encourages you to make full use of all 3 characters and their abilities. The games levels look beautiful as well.Good points:- i like the idea of having the 3 characters with different abilties and the levels give you plenty of oppurtunity to make use of them- the level design is great and with plenty of traps and puzzles to try and get past-the game isbeautiful to look atBad points:- there isnt much variety of enemy and bosses and they are generally pretty boring to fight. The regular enemies are just a case of bashing the attack button with the occasional block. With the bosses you get put in a small room with a big boss who will have a glowing area of their body you have to hit. Since your attacks dont do mch damage the bosses are a dull grind-The game has a story of sorts but it pretty generic and forgettable			",446,133,17,76,93,4,90

												You only have to look for a split second to tell a lot of love went into this game. Trine is very good platformer albeit a little on the easy side. I recommend buying it. ProsThe music and sound design is outstanding; the title screen track is particularly fitting.The animations are up to par.Graphics are vibrant and detailed. They create the right atmosphere.Controls are responsive, which is nice in a platform game ;)ConsMediocre story, but that didn't really bother me. It ties the game together and does the job, but nothing special.Even on very hard, the game is not hard at all.The puzzles are very self explanatory.Leveling/special item system could use a little more depth.

												I highly recommend this game. I'm typically not ""all that into"" 2D platformers, but this game was a true gem, and an example of what a good 2D platoformer is. The story is enchanting (no pun intended :) ), althoguh not enthralling, the combat is good but not great, but the puzzles are what make this game standout. I loved the little challenges in-between the ""skirmishes"" with the undead, figuring out how to get over a hurdle (literally sometimes). I loved that the puzzles were very non-linear and you could brute force your way through them, or you could figure out a clever alternative :). It's pretty short (I only played 10 hours on easy- maybe longer on harder difficulties- I think the only difference is the amount of enemies spawned), but it's short and sweet. The replayability isn't too high, but I don't care so much to replay games, so that doesn't affect me. All-in-all, a charming short game with a lot of thought and care placed into it, and even if you don't generally like platoformers, I'd recommend giving it a try :).			",1350,684,44,159,150,12,196

												What can I say about this game, besides that it's beautiful, wonderful, entertaining and feels like a truly masterpiece? Only that Trine looks and plays like a fairytale arcade, not to difficult, rather relaxing and with many mini-puzzles elements that I also love. I'm not big fan of arcade games, so it was good to me that Trine more like to test your brain with puzzles, than your reflexes. Sadly I cannot tell this about the second part.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

All in all this game is a blast to play, even more fun when played with friends.			",244,76,3,41,25,3,54

												At its heart, Trine is a really first rate puzzle game. There never feels as though there’s one ‘correct’ way to get past anything the game puts in your way. My one complaint is with the enemies. 90% of them seem to be skeletons with very slight variations of weapons or health. Their slow spawning rates just multiply the monotony. Small nitpicks aside, Trine is quite the spectacle to behold, with gorgeous graphics and a narrator second only to Bastion. While most puzzle game offerings seem to settle for casual colour matches or rhythm exercises, Trine presents a masterclass in how to be puzzle-focused without loosing any kind of depth.

												Trine is a wounderful game that is, by far and away, well worth playing. Trine focused on a trio of heroes, warrior, thief, and mage, who have been bound to each other via a magical artifact called the 'Trine'. This artifact allows the three to switch between each other instantly as they work their way through the world in an attempt to find several artifacts to free them from their curse.Trine is a beautiful platformer with vibrant worlds that are a wonder to behold and boasts interesting gameplay with its unique mechanics, but sadly, ends up being repetative and lacking in terms of difficulty while the enemies end up becoming VERY annoying but never actually difficult. Reccomended priceing 5-15 dollars at mostRating: 4/5 Beautiful and interesting, but filled with annoying enemies and repetative.			",293,107,0,102,29,3,58
