												This game is how sequels should be - it takes everything that was good about the first game and improves it, builds on the old characters, and smooths out the rough edges of the original. The two brothers play differently enough to give an incentive to play through it twice, so there's plenty of value to it. The only reason I ever had to not recommend it before was because the field of view was extremely low (46 degrees) with no way to fix it, but thankfully a mod has finally fixed that recently, allowing you to go up to 75 (which is still pretty low, but a lot more manageable). http://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood-realism-mod I don't recommend using the date-changing part of the mod (the read-me and description explains how to only apply the gameplay changes), but everything else about the mod is great. With this mod, I can finally completely recommend this game.Also, on another note, if you have problems with the voices sounding like they were recorded in a bad microphone, you may need to lower the audio quality of your sound device in Windows. It probably won't be a problem for most people, but if you have a high quality sound system and use 24-bit audio, you may need to switch to 16-bit, 44100 Hz for this game.			",574,245,9,46,42,6,55

												+ Interesting/Captivating Story (even though a little cliched)+ Very satisfactory shooting+ Unique cover mechanics+ High replay value as you can play each chapter with any one of the brothers (except the first 2, which are like an intro/tutorial to their abilities)+ Nice environment, decent visuals.+ Good controller support, with decent aim-assist. (I played with a KB/M though)- Lots and lots of shooting, sometimes gets tedious- AI is kinda wierd, they will keep throwing dynamite even if you run 1000 miles away from them.- Not many guns/customization available- Maybe the Option to SWITCH brothers at WILL would have made the game even more fun to playVerdict: MUST BUY. The game easily justifies the 10$ retail price, I got it for 6$ in sale and was a steal at this price.Do You Recommend this game?:  HELL YES  ",129,28,7,10,15,0,11

												Bound in Blood is a much smaller game than Red Dead Redemption, but it is still one of the best wild west themed shooters.The Good:-Decent story with good voice acting.-The gameplay mechanics are solid, and not too repetitive.-Graphics: While many things look average, some of the environments are truly beautiful (at times on par with Crysis 1).-This game does not shy away from christian themes, which fit well with the story. And it does so without seeming unpleasantly pro or anti christian.-A good manual save system (no annoying checkpoint reloads).-No Ubisoft Uplay account required!The Bad (mostly minor):-A very low Field-of-View (not fixable) due to being optimized for console TV screens.-The first level (tutorial) has clumsy scripting and mediocre graphics, but it gets better with later levels.-Bodies disappear the moment you look away, due to silly Xbox360/PS3 RAM limits.-AI is mediocre (not a big problem since most things are scripted)-screen vibration effects severely overdone during scripted explosions.-Enemies move like ants (no movement inertia), making aiming a pain sometimes.The Ugly:-No COOP mode! With the two protagonists working together, this game would have been perfect for co-op, and yet there is no co-op mode! What a missed opportunity!Overall, I can easily recommend this game, especially in a sale.			",54,7,0,5,1,0,2

												Call of JuarezÂ®: Bound in Blood is the second game in the series and story-wise it's a prequel to the first game. It is a story of a younger Ray McCall and his brothers Thomas and William.Like its predecessor, the game is a first-person shooter with the Western setting. And like the first Call of Juarez it has a captivating story, a little ""dark"" atmosphere, two playable characters with two different playstyles (and this time - the ability to freely choose your character for a given episode, except for the first two ""tutorial"" episodes and the one near the endgame) and lots of gun-blazing action.What I am going to say is that this game is in my opinion the best Call of Juarez game and one of the best western and FPS games I've ever played. Almost all the flaws from the first game are gone here, Bound in blood runs smoothly, has beautiful graphics, great atmosphere and soundtrack, cool plot that will keep you in tension for the whole game, epic finale that will probably make you shed a small manly tear, and two badass characters to play.About the characters: Ray McCall plays almost the same as he did in the first game being able to dual-wield pistols and throw dynamites, although personality-wise here he is not a preacher and acts like a total badass. His brother Thomas is a little similar to Billy Candle - he is the agile guy of this game, he can do some lasso swinging, he can use throwing knives for stealthy kills (although you won't need to be stealthy in this game as much as it was needed in the first) and he can use a bow with arrows. There are still not that many weapons in the game, but there is definitely more, than it was in the first CoJ, and you can buy upgraded versions of the same weapon.In the end, there is really nothing serious I can point out as bad things, I was completely satisfied with the game. If you liked the first CoJ, this is a must. If you like Western theme this is a must. If you want a cool story and a decent FPS game this is a must.VERDICT: 9/10			",84,0,0,3,0,0,0

												New Hats, Old Tricks:The original Call of Juarez, though ambitious and great, was a bit unpolished. Bound in Blood serves as a prequel to the original's story, and it manages to polish some mechanics from the original game, but it does not try to reach as far as it's predecessor.Bound in Blood tells the story of the McCall brothers and it covers some familiar ground. Ray still charges in headfirst with guns blazing, while his brother Thomas acts as Billy Candle's surrogate, taking up the stealth and whip mechanics with a focus on long range weaponry (including the bow).Overall the game feels very familiar, but with some slight gameplay changes. You can now (for most missions) choose which character to play prior to starting to the mission. This choice will slightly alter how you play a level (distraction vs. stealth), and it will also drastically change how you play. The mechanics of the two characters also feel a bit more fleshed out ( the slow down for Thomas is not limited to the bow, and Ray has more than a bible and breastplate to set him apart). One neat addition is that the brothers are usually working together and the AI is fairly competent. Though their one-liners outstay their welcome before the credits role, its neat to hear the brothers call out to each other and actually have them help, rather than the mostly isolated experience from the first game. A few other slight changes include  equipment. You will find and be rewarded with money that you can use to buy more ammo and better guns. You can also make extra money during a few little open world sequences where you can hunt down bounty. I never found myself too concerned with money, though I would run out of ammo every now and then, but  I was always happy to get a better weapon. Overall though, the money is more of an optional bit of fun rather than a necessity.The story, much like the first one, is not the absolute best narrative, but it serves its purpose well. Some of the ties it makes to the first game (both in the levels and characters) are pretty interesting if you were a fan of the first game. The lore and charm that the game is steeped in shines clearly in this entry, and it feels familiar in a good way.Bound in Blood makes great use of its Old West setting to tell a story of sibling rivalry through solid FPS mechanics. Fans and strangers alike should give this entry a try.			",1617,591,30,154,138,14,212

												For a game dated back to 2009, COJ:BIB shows that the developers, Techland, have learned some lessons from their previous COJ games and concentrate on shooting people rather than playing Indiana Jones or Tarzan, and they certainly built up a bunch of characters that have a bit more dimension than typical western shooter fare, and it is only surpassed by the latest COJ: Gunslinger. BIB has the McCall brothers, with family in Georgia, fighting as a part of the Confederacy trying to hold back the Yankee army against General Sherman's raid. You'll spend most of the first part of the game shooting Yankee soldiers defending your homeland, so to speak, and later, fight your way home to save your brother and mother... against orders to withdraw, which makes both of the McCall brothers deserters. Without too much of a spoiler, by the time they arrived, mother's already dead, and the younger brother actually is a priest and will not fight.  After fighting they way out of Georgia, McCalls drifted to Arkansas, enraged the local sheriff (by spoiling his daughter), who challenged them to a duel, got killed, and the entire town started to hunt them forcing them to run for Mexico, where the senior McCall, Ray, told them about the alleged treasure of Juarez, and how they can claim it and use it to rebuilt their family. The two brothers have different specialties. Ray, the older and stronger brother, is a close quarters combat guy with dual revolvers and dynamite. He can use concentration (COJ's ""bullet time"") to designate targets for rapid salvos killing a whole slew of targets at a time. Thomas ""Tom"", the middle brother, prefers a ranged and stealth attack. He is deadly with a rifle, he can throw knives for silent kills, and he can use a lasso to raise himself to a better elevation for better sniper kills. He can also use a bow later in the game. He also has a concentration mode but he can only engage up to 6 targets in a ""quick draw"". At the beginning the scripted missions are one following another, and sometimes you can choose which brother to play in the mission, with slightly different branches and levels, as it's two different POVs of the same game. Later, when the game opens up, you can roam the land and take on side missions for extra cash, treasure, and so on, and encounter traders with better weapons available for sale. There are even random encounters. There are quick drawn duels in the game where you need to keep the guy in view and keep your hand near the pistol, and use the mouse to ""draw"" the pistol and shoot. This mechanic was vastly improved in Gunslinger though. The game, being old runs fine on a 3 year old gaming laptop even at higher resolutions. While the tasks are a bit monotonous (shoot people) it's what makes Western a Western, right? I personally prefer Gunslinger. Skip the Cartel, IMHO. Play this and Gunslinger should be enough COJ.

This review is a little lengthy, so if you just want a quick summary of why I recommend this game skip the Results and read from there.Techland makes a fantastic continuation onto the Call of Jaurez Series with Bound in Blood. A brilliant game brings amazing level design, amazing combat systems, beautiful scenery, and the perfect ambience to life.Story:Call of Jaurez Bound in Blood acts a prequel to Call of Jaurez. The story takes off with the alleged rivalry between Thomas and Ray McCall; yet, how did the rivalry all begin? The game takes off during the Civil War playing as the McCalls as they fight for the south. As they abandon the cause and go out on their own the story takes off with how the Gold of Jaurez and the beautiful Marissa draws the brothers to unite but then tears them apart.Campaign:This epic campaign allows you to play as either Ray or Thomas McCall for each mission. Both the characters play differently with Ray being similar to Call of Jaurez. Ray has perks in pistol usage and can use dual pistols unlike Thomas who plays stealthier using a Bow and Rifles. Both of the brothers can wield rifles and pistols, but Thomas can wield a Bow, Lasso, and Knives while Ray can wield twin pistols and dynamite. Thomas being the younger of the two brothers must help his older brother climb up ledges and complete tasks while Ray typically sits back and supports him. There are fifteen chapters, although two of those chapters are open world and offers three missions each. You can purchase weapons within most levels that make your character more powerful, although they are not entirely necessary. The campaign is incredibly easily even on Hard difficulty, but once you complete the campaign you unlock Harder difficulty. Almost every level contains a duel which allows you to test your dukes with fast timing draw. Gameplay:Unlike in the predecessor they have fleshed out a lot of the kinks in the combat system. The duel system pits you one on one with an adversary where you must line yourself straight in with an opponent, rapidly draw your gun at the sound of a bell, and pull the trigger. Each of the two brothers has a different quick draw technique which requires different mechanisms to implement. I personally did not like Thomasâ quick draw as it is limited to one pistol and doesn't give you control of what is going on around you. There are many weapons which offer three different stats: Reload Speed, Damage, and Range. Although none of these guns list ammunition capacity which is incredibly important. Hints:>Donât purchase ammunition; it is completely worthless as you find so much of it during the game.>The Volcano Gun carries twelve bullets, which is the largest out of any pistol.>The Heavy Rifle is essentially the scoped rifle without a scope.>There is no Superb Scoped Rifle; you might as well buy the prime one as it kills almost all enemies in one hit. (You can also find one on Chapter 11 at the point where the wagon gets stuck in the river).>Apparently your money transfers over to the next play-through.Results:If you are a fan of the Western Genre Call of Jaurez Bound in Blood is a fantastic play-through. Luckily because it is a prequel to the original Call of Jaurez you can play this game prior or without playing the original. The campaign adds amazing depth to the lore of Call of Jaurez and its beautiful storyline draws the player into a gripping tale. The campaign is a good length, about seven hours and eight hours if you do all the side quests in the open world chapters. Because of how the two brothersâ play differently I could easily play this game again just using the other brother because it would alter the game significantly. If you love shoot âem up westerns, just want to go on a killing frenzy, or desire a good store then this is the game for you. I donât buy many games at full price, but at $9.99 this game is a steal. Pros:+Fantastic campaign+Beautiful level design+Offers two open world levels that allow you to explore while being based on linear gameplay. [I am not a fan of open-world first person shooters, but by only partially integrating open world dynamics into the campaign really makes a good twist].+Amazing weapon combinations which each offer great potential to how you play the game. +A story which gets you to continue playing even if only just to figure out what happens next.+You get to fight during the civil war, against the Indians, and as a bandit. Cons:-For some odd reason when I started the game the opening cinematic, Ubisoft Logo, and the menu cinematic where all upside down. [At first I thought it was some artsy design, but then I noticed Ubisoft was not tlosidU]. -The duels can be irritating as you have to drag the mouse down to draw the pistol [if you have a tiny space for your mouse this can be hard].

												Call of Juarez: Bound in BloodRating: 8/10Overview: First Person ShooterThe Good:+ The game is a prequel to the first Call of Juarez telling the story of Ray and his two brothers on their journey to discover the lost gold of Juarez. The characters are extremely well done and the story is interesting enough to hold the entire game together and keep you interested until the very end. + Before every mission you have a choice to play as either Ray or Thomas. Each one has their own unique pros and cons and sometimes in the mission they may diverge and go on separate paths offering a different perspective in certain situations. + The western frontier setting once again takes center stage and is even more beautiful and breathtaking than the original. + The shooting mechanics are greatly improved over the first game.  + Soundtrack The Average:Every once in a while you will have a one on one duel in which you have to be quick to draw out your gun and shoot your opponent. These moments are pretty intense and fun and its handled extremely well. The only problem however is that using a mouse makes it almost impossible to succeed. After failing many attempts, I switched over to a controller and was able to beat in on my first try. The level design itself can also feel a bit repetitive at times. The levels are way more linear than the first game but the objectives in each mission starts to feel the same half way through. Go here, kill all the enemies, rinse and repeat. As you play, your npc companions will often comment on how well or badly you are doing. It makes the characters more believable, however after hearing the same comments for the fifth time it starts to get annoying. Regenerating health trivialize battlesThe Bad:-In what has to be one of the stranger bugs I've ever experienced, the videos are upside down. This is almost a universal issue with the game with no fix/patch in sight. Not exactly a good impression when you start the game and literally the first thing you see is a game bug.  ConclusionA HUGE improvement over the first game, just about everything has been upgraded and improved upon. At times though I felt like I was playing Call of Duty: The Western. Regenerating health, linear levels, and shooting hordes of bad guys over and over again. A fun game and worth checking out. ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

Posted: May 3, 2016
												I really liked Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood; the prequel to the first Call of Juarez game. Set in 1864, and then 1865, and later, 1866, Bound in Blood revolves around the McCall brothers. You might recall Ray McCall, the badass priest from the first game. And you might remember Thomas McCall, the ""father"" of Billy Candle from the first game. Well, they're the stars of Bound in Blood, and their youngest brother, William, shares the adventure with them as the good shepard, a preacher.The game begins in 1864, when the Civil War is coming close to an end. Ray McCall is a member of the Confederate Army, and works to make sure Thom is safe. Ultimately, the two brothers desert their ranks to save their family from the Union army. They manage to save WIlliam, but their mother has already passed away. This is where the game's story really picks up. Their commanding officer is Barnsby, and he is ratherâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off that the McCall brothers fled. He's also delusional and thinks that, despite the Union army winning the war, he can help revitalize the southern army and win the war.Anyway, the McCall brothers follow what I like to call the ""classic Western format."" The classic Western format is when a group of people, the people here being the McCall brothers, travel a great distance with a single goal in mind, to make some money in order to rebuild their family home. They travel, and run into a great number of characters, some of which are in the first game, set some 18 years after the events of this game. Without getting into the plot, the gist of the McCall brothers traveling involves getting into plenty of gun fights.The narrative of William is easily the centerpoint of the game. It's strong and well written. It emphasizes the various themes of the game, and his narrative will ultimately lead Ray to become the man he becomes in the first Call of Juarez game. I will say that the writing and story in Bound in Blood is quite strong. What's not strong would be the animation. I'm not surprised either, it's a Techland game and most of their games have animation that's not terrible, but not great, like Naughty Dog or Remedy or Rockstar great. However, the vast openess of the game, despite being a linear shooter, is remarkable, and does more to make up for the games few technical shortcomings. The scope of the world that Techland made is quite something. It's not surprising considering how they've transitioned into the open world genre with their more recent games. Hell, even Bound in Blood has some ""intermission"" parts where you can do a few side quests in a semi-open world zone.Pretty tight game overall though. Voice acting could be better from a few characters. And some of the visual effects weren't executed that great; most post processing effects really, specifically depth of field.8.3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoyed playing Call of Juarez, the original game.  But this sequel is a true sequel.  Actually, this is a prequel to the original game.  The characters in this game are deeply related to the characters of the original game, and the game does  a great job of linking the two together.  The story weaves a wonderful tale and makes perfect sense with how the events of the original game pan out.  The action in the game was upgraded with some quick action events, and better dueling.  You get to choose between the two brothers throughout most of the game, which is nice since they each offer a different skill set.  I burned through this game, and I must say between graphics, story, action, and great pacing, this game is most likely in my top 20 games of all time.  Wonderfully done, don't miss this.

												I've been through the game twice about a year between each run. I'll try to keep it short.Things I enjoyed:-Engaging story-Characters aren't complex but seem mostly realistic-Neat cover mechanic that is optional and not required or forced but still handy-Learning curve and difficulty is very good-Varied environments-Duels are awesome-2 different characters offer slightly different play styles-Ray is too coolThings I did not enjoy:-Repetitiveness toward the end-Scripted events that I was not prepared for the first time-Weapon choice isn't as varied as I'd like-Villains are forgettable and hurt the neat story slightly-Not much replay ability other than collectible scrollsWestern setting FPS, and just Old West games in general are pretty rare especially on PC. For that reason I'm willing to say it's a must try for anyone who likes that kind of setting. Anyone else might not appreciate it and be able to fall into the story. I feel that though the mechanics make it a functional game it is pretty story driven and somewhat cinematic. I really enjoyed it and may play it again in the future.			",182,18,6,20,15,2,23

												Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood: Graphics are Great, Sounds is Excellent and Music is Good. Like the First Game it's in the Top 10 Cowboy game's of all time. The Story was Beautifully Done and It takes place before the first game. It's about the McCall Brother's Their are Three of them, The Two what are playable are Thomas & Ray. William is the third brother who is a Man of God and Marisa is the woman who will test their bond as brother's. I forgot to say in the first game review the Gun's and Bomb's are splendid to play around with in the game to see what you might like to use through out the game and the Showdown's are hard to do but I like it. Yes I do recommend this game and It is Ten Buck's like the first game. Now down to business Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood is a 8 out of 10			",154,8,0,19,3,0,10

I really enjoy the small side missions you can do for money to buy more guns, was a nice break from the story. Speaking of the story, it's pretty good. Gets you invested in the characters and makes you care about what's going on. Shooting is tight and satisfying, not too easy and not too hard. Definitely worth a buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For a 2009 game I believe the graphics are still nice  enough for me and not demanding on my gear (playing eyefinity 4800x900, getting a constant 60fps with an ATI HD5870 1GB on max settings. You can feel the hot sun and the dust around you. The only problem I encountered is with the cut scenes. For an obscure reason they are all zoomed in, most of the time I could not see the faces. Not sure if it is related to my eyefinity setup or the game itself. I heard some people having upside down cut scenes and other weird annoying problems.At first I wasn't so sure about the gun play, it felt weird and slow, very slow but I soon realized that it's because it's the 1800's and the weapons were not as sophisticated as the one you find in modern day fps like call of duty for instance.But once you start upgrading (buying new guns) it gets much better and the fire fights are actually pretty satisfying, especially playing  as Ray (dual pistols). The duels in my opinion are far too often and very annoying, not fun to perform, they are more frustrating than satisfying. I would have prefer fewer duels and more live battles against the bosses. The story and the characters are interesting, not revolutionnary but well executed and the voice acting is amazing.In the end, I found myself enjoying the game more than when I started it but I had to deal with the zoomed in cut scenes. If you are in search of a nice shooter with decent story, great western atmosphere which I believe is not that common than this is for you. Got mine on sale for 4.99. For this price, it was entertaining and enjoyable.*Forgot to mention that there is what seems to be a common bug at the beginning where you try to escape the city on a stage coach but you get killed every single time, I went reading about it online and you have to turn down your graphics all the way and it allows you to complete this problematic section. It was frustrating, I think I tried it like 10 times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thoroughly enjoyable western shooter with a solid dynamic cover mechanic that works spectacularly well. It has a fairly interesting story which is actually a prequel to the 1st game and theres a great sense of humor. The voice acting and cutscene animations are a treat, at times you'll get the impression of watching a really good western movie. You also get to horseback ride across decently sized map areas where you can do some side missions like killing outlaws, repelling indian attacks and rescuing damsels in distress.7.5/10

												Nice western shooter. I recommend a mouse with adjustable sensitivity. Y'all want to notch it up for the cannon work and quick-draw duelin', then turn it down for the main streets, saloons, and general score settlin'. Don't forget to collect the bounty posters in stores and do the side missions for some extra coin and gun upgradein'. Quick loadin' 6 shooters and Winchester classic rifles be ya main bread winners in the mean dusty streets of 1864. See you in the past brother.			",57,1,2,3,0,0,3

												I love this game, the first one was great and this one definitely not only rides on that success but builds on it. It's a little bit older by now in game standards but it still shines like a gem when compared to many other FPS's. The replay value is pretty good in my opinion since you can play as either of the two brothers and use a variety of different guns throughout the game that you can slowly upgrade if you keep your coffers full. The graphics still hold up pretty well too, they aren't perfect but even today I can go back and admire the beauty that is B.i.B. The campaign isn't the longest and I do wish it could be longer, but I do go back and play through this game fairly regularly and enjoy EVERY SECOND. The Western FPS franchise is a niche in today's game world as there aren't many titles that can claim they are part of the ""Western Genre"". In my honest opinion, and most likely the opinion of others, any Western FPS that comes out following this game would do well and GREATLY BENEFIT from taking some pointers from this game. I'd give it a 9/10, and the fact that it is only 10.00 dollars on steam (not counting sales) makes this game a steal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an ok game with a good gunplay, but nothing more. An average shooter with a western setting which is rarity in the industry. However after Red Dead Redemption it bacame obsolete. The story is like a mix between a mexican soap opera and a b series western, but it's fun a a dumb way.3/5			",271,105,17,29,14,1,38

												THE GOODExciting Story and a bunch of interesting characters. I was quite surprised how well the game turned out narrative-wise, considering I had a feeling I wasnt going to be enjoying this game in my first impressions. The story and the voice acting here are done very well. The Duels are too simple, but still satisfying. 'Concentration Mode' and the two protagonists play styles keeps the experience fresh for the player. Furthermore, in some chapters, the two protagonists take different paths, thus almost feeling like you are playing a different level depending one what character you play. The game takes you to various and interesting Western settings, although it smacks you in the middle of a Civil War in Georgia at the beginning. THE BADThe protagonists annoyingly repeat the same dialoge when small talking to one another during game. For this title, I felt the controls were more optimized for controller input, rather than KB/Mouse, and although (In comparison) controllers always tend to have clunky controls for FPS, this game felt much more so. This feels especially true during some of the 'Platforming' segments of the game when playing a Thomas. The AI is one of the most awful things I have experienced in videos games. And I have played many games with bad AIs. Ugh, its just....Its just really bad. THE UGLYThe graphics are pretty darn good for the time, but has not aged well. The object pop-ins are very noticable. Also noticable is the recycled character models. Even the faces for relevant, plot driven characters are recycled for NPCs! And the animations are done poorly, even if they are done by hand.

												That game became a classic in the moment it was released. The story mode is great (maybe a little bit short, though), with a dramatic storyline and the action is intensive. Also, it has the most addictive multiplayer ever with many classes to unlock, maps to play on and also a handful of game modes to try. If you are runing Windows 7 or Windows 8 you might experience some issues, though. Like the videos (not the cutscenes!) rendering upside-down in black and white. Also, in order to run the game I had to switch the sound sampling of my PC down to CD and also to play multiplayer, I had to disable all of my network adapters except for the main one. Saddly, due to the game being slightly old and lacking propper support for Win 7 and 8, there are not many servers online and sometimes there are just a few players to play with.Anyway, despite its flaws, the game is very nice, with beautiful graphics to look at and nice action to keep you thrilled. If you like westerns, then you gotta give it a try. For 10 bux the price you really ain't loosing anything.			",60,4,27,11,6,0,8

												Another excellent story in the Call of Juarez tale.Unlike the first Call of Juarez, Bound in Blood has less innovation, although there is still plenty. With a brilliant dynamic cover system, clever duel wielding, and a vary enjoyable ""semi-freeroam"" setup in the story mode, this is a thoroughly enjoyable game to play.Graphically it is rather good, having aged well. The audio is of rather low quality, for seemingly no reason, but the sounds that are there actually work well and the music - while a little out of place at times - is excellent for the most part.But again, what makes this game really stand out is the fantastic story. This game would also make an amazing film, with a story that twists and turns, pulls on all the emotional strings and gets you on the edge of your seat. The ending came about too quickly and too abrubtly however.All in all, if you enjoyed the first Call of Juarez or like the Wild Western scene, this is a game worth your money.On a ""bugs"" note, playing this game on Windows 8 will cause the intro movies to play flipped up to down and left to right , and in black and white. No idea why (commonly reported bug) but it has NO effect on gameplay.			",245,7,9,27,14,0,17

												This game is heavily tied to being a confederate turned renegade. You get to shoot old timey guns and travel across hipster desert lands of og murica'. The pistols after lunchtime are fun to win and lose. There's a lot of hats to shoot at and guns drop along with moneyz. You can use the moneyz to get better old timey guns and shoot at more hats. The music is really twangy and the cutscenes are like comics. I recommend this game for the pistol after lunchtime crowd.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I suppose back when this game was released in 2009, it was one of the best titles that year. Now? It's still a decent western shooter with quite a lot of tricks but the issues are too out there for it to be enjoyable. Clunky controls, locked-on camera and performance issues to name a few. If you catch this for cheap buy it, otherwise play something else in the meantime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my humble opinion, the Call of Juarez series is rather hit or miss- pulling one game randomly out of the bunch is 50/50 as far as you getting your money's worth, and that's saying something given that there's currently only four games in the series. Glad to say, this is one of them. Sound- Voices sound like they were recorded with a potato, yet the gunshots are crisp. Explosions look flat, though dynamite and oil lamps scattered around the environment are effective enough. This is a western, though- the focus is on the gunplay.Gunplay- Just a touch tricky with some of the special moves, but once you get the hang of it you're damn near unstoppable playing as one of two brothers- Thomas, the sneaky and lithe long ranged specialist with knives and a bow, or as Ray, the guns-blazing, dual weilding muscle boundâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥kicker. The game rarely limits your approach as far as what weapons you're actually allowed to utilize- as Ray I often found myself picking off people with a long rifle, and with Thomas I've blown away many an outlaw with a double barrel- the differences lie in how you utilize these weapons, and also, what perspective you experience the story from.The Story- It's well written and engaging as any good western should be- not reinventing the wheel by any means, but satisfying to see unfold- and given the different perspectives of each brother through these missions, it's worth a second go just to see what exactly is going on when the other brother is out of sight. How you determine the quality of the ending and how everything get's tied together will ultimately be a rather subjective thing, but I personally enjoyed it. I can't speak for the multiplayer- I haven't tried it, but there's a community however small it may be dedicated to keeping it alive, so it must have some merit.If you're new to western themed games but enjoy first person shooters heavily focused on story and gameplay, definitely give this one a whirl- if you're already a fan of such things, don't even wait for it to go on sale like I did, ten bucks is already a steal, minor little quirks and flaws be damned.

												This game is a product of its era. Like the transition from Return To Castle Wolfenstein to Wolfenstein 2009 (the same year this one came out), this is slower and even more linear than its predecessor, with a lot of handholding and eye candy. Still, it's a pretty good game, with nice visuals and an interesting story. Worth seeing it through to the end...... even if that means doing all the mandatory duels/standoffs. Such a poorly implemented game mechanic, what was Techland thinking?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not necessarely the best game ever, but it sure is one my of my favourite games.The game is a prequel to the first Call of Juarez and, while the story isn't all that great, the atmosphere is really evocative of that period, also thanks to a great soundtrack.The gameplay features a variety of guns with different stats, but the difference isn't really that important. The main characters have different abilities: one can go akimbo with the two sidearms he has and use dynamite, the other has a lasso and can aim better with rifles. Also, in some levels you can find rideable horses.When the main story is beaten, you can either go play the multiplayer or download some Extra Missions online/create Extra Missions for yourself using the official software called ""ChromEd - User Content Creator"". With this really intuitive tool you have the possibility to create an open world environment with different quests and stores, so that you can have a more different experience from the Main Story. In case you don't have time to prepare a map, just download ""A man and the wild west"" from cojmodding.com , you won't regret it.Story: 7Graphics: 8Gameplay: 9Challenge: 7.5Sound: 8Replayability: 8ENJOYMENT: 9FRUSTRATION: 5 ",532,126,11,40,24,4,34

												The single-player took me a little over 5 hrs to beat. The game was really a awesome fun old western shootout. The story was really good and had some great cut-scenes in it. The Gameplay was interesting in the fact that you had the choice to choose which character to play and use for every chapter. The Ai were fun to kill. The graphics were amazing and fun to look at. The down fall of the game was that the voice to character mouth movement weren't always in sync with each other. The online portion of the game is alot of fun and still active. There are different game modes for online like robbing a bank and trying to escape. The voices in the game were great! It really made you feel like you were in their time and area. I loved the guns in the game they shot and sounded like the real thing. It is a great game! Pick this one up when it comes on sale but not at full price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Suprisingly good classic gritty western story. The shooting is solid, especially when playing as Ray and dual-wielding 6-shooters, and the special shooty-powers of each brother makes you feel like quite a badass when you pull them of perfectly and kill 4-5-6-7 opponents in the blink of an eye. Not a terribly long game, 8 hours total including reloads and the few side-missions you can take underway, but well worth the price still, especially now that it's an older game and you can probably find it on sale.

So weird that you could tell the developers had never set foot anywhere in Arizona. I don't know why Tucson had a canyon that dwarfed the Grand up north by as much as 5 times. OH!

												It's an extremely simple game in nature. Shortly it is a western style first person shooter.You can play as 2 characters: stealth or brute though the nature of the game seems to favor the stealth approach.The story was rather good, not heroistic. You don't get to be a good guy, you're a bloody bandit and a murderer.The game was extremely linear though. Reminded me of Splinter Cell Conviction in that aspect. I think there were 7 side missions in Bound In Blood and they all served the purpose of earning money to buy better weapons. The nature of the side missions was not different as well: go somewhere, kill some guys, duel.The duel was probably one of the distinctive elements of the game. I personally found that irritating.There were not many guns in the game but the ones that were, were interesting. Weapon upgrade in game was extremely well balanced.Verdict: It's an original game with a good story, working controls and good flow. You could hardly be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So far, this is the best ""wild west"" game I've ever played as I was not so happy with it's sequel - Gunslinger!In my opinion, ""Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood"" offers a fairly realistic (and cool) experience of the second half of the XIX century in western USA.I say fairly realistic as, for example, I doubt that the repeating rifles were used on such a large scale during the American Civil War.I love the game play and the weapons - too bad there is no ""open world"" game like this (to my knowledge)!Though it is an old game, I fully recommend this game, which gave me the thrills of the ""spaghetti westerns""!

												This game has drastic improvements from the first game. The graphics are suberb, action is abundent, the storyline is intriguing and cleverly put together. I had no issues with getting a controller to work with the game. The only problems I experienced is the intro movie before the main menu is upside down, which doesn't affect the game at all and the game crashes within a minute or so of starting the campaign. If you have this issue try this: Go to the advanced settings of your audio device ie: speakers or headset and change the default format to DVD quality. It worked perfectly for me and I didn't have any other problems with the game. I recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS and enjoys a good story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Call of Juarez Bound in Blood is one of the most underrated games of all time. It's a fantastic western shooter with great shooting mechanics, a cool light cover system, a fun story and awesome multiplayer(that isnt played anymore.) It's no Red Dead Redemption but its a great linnear western thats well worth the price of admission.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I see Bound in Blood as a total reversal from its predecessor - with the sequel now having significantly better mechanics at the cost of one of the blandest stories in the franchise. If you played the first and liked the story, youâre going to buy and play this to see how Ray ended up being the total bada** he was. But even still, youâll feel tempted to skip through a lot of cutscenes to skip bland character stories until the end. The game follows the story of two brothers who desert their army force to defend their family home. When they get there, they get back in touch with their other brother. To rebuild their home and get rich beyond their wildest dreams, they set off to Mexico for the sake of that golden treasure. Along the way, they run into some cool and not-so-cool indians, the big wigs of the army they abandoned, a foxy mamacita, and numerous sketchy Mexicans that meet and exceed stereotypical expectations. I will say that the writing was passable and focused primarily on the brotherly bonds, but left something to be desired in terms of wanting to be interested in other subplots and its characters. As for the actual gameplay, I just canât get over how fluid the cover system was in this game - it was perfectly responsive to tense shootouts. The game focuses on two styles of gameplay based on the two brothers. Both have similar styles - one plays to a run and gun style while the other relies on  long-ranged combat with some elements of stealth. But because both classes have pistols that youâll use more than anything else because of the ubiquity of ammo, thereâs little that sets them apart. Sure, thereâs missions that involve each brother going into certain zones for a few minutes. But thatâs about as differing as it gets. Weapon upgrades are based on the money you collect in sidequests. Iâll say that itâs worth it - since its rare for henchmen to drop great weapons, and they donât drop the best guns in the game that have one shot capabilities.The grind doesnât take as long as you think, and the rich quasi-open world environments (at that time). Again, you want to complain about the barren world, but itâs like late 1800s to early 1900s Mexico. Thereâs nothing there. Levels are designed well, but the AIâs not so great. But in the instance of laddergoat (where you can force animals to walk up ladders), it can be hilariously bad. But it doesnât detract from the difficulty. Thereâs also quick draw duel mechanics they just happen to shoehorn into every single battle. Itâs cool, but definitely overdone. You donât get a sense of progression - theyâre all just the same and easy enough for you to beat in less than 3 tries.Bound in blood should satiate FPS fans that crave a decent shootout. Just donât expect the story to work wonders.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Call of Juarez Bound in Blood is a game that tries to recreate that atmosphere of a western movie within an FPS game and while it succeeds in more places than any game I have ever seen attempt this is still falls short in the end.While the game does limit the speed and number of enemies somewhat in an attempt to accomplish this it still devolves into a massive shootout far too often and the speed of the game prevents you from truly getting immersed within the western feel.The multi-player works quite well although it is all but dead these days. Open maps which often boils down to one vs. one's and quick draws.The game does deserve credit for attempting a scenario that works contrary to how the FPS genre is structured and coming away quite well from it. It is unfortunately not quite enough and that condemns this game to be merely a footnote in the history of gaming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gun play is new and the enemy physics are nice and satisfying but the cover system was pretty bad. The lighting graphics were actually really damn good but the animation quality wasn'tThe story is actually kinda intruiging although forgetableThe game has moments where one objective in particular is extremely hard to do, such as this one level where I was in a carriage and had to shoot from inside of it, the only problem was that the cart was shaking like a sumâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and I looked like I had parkinsons and couldn't hit anyone. It took me a solid hour to completeStory is very replayable I like how you play as 2 different characters and it actually makes a difference who you chose but what annoyed me was how it made me chose my character before they introduce me to the level, so I'd be playing as Rey (the duel revolver guy with the school-shooter trench coat) on a level where we were fighting Native Americans and therefor I couldn't get ammo for my revolver so I relied on using a terrible rifle.In the end though I did have some fun and I'd definetly recommend this game especially since it's so cheap.

												A Great Game Plagued With Weird Design ChoicesFirst off let me say that this game is genuinely entertaining for any FPS fan but is much more enjoyable if you have even a slight affinity for the Wild West, which I have.  The primary reason I enjoy this game is because of its combat, which should be very good since it is more then 90% of the game, the remaining 10% being weird sandbox sections and the, in my opinion, oddly unsatisfying duels.  If not from these duels I would, without a doubt, give this game much higher praise but left me just bring up for a second how weird these duels are.  Through all of the other fights you have regenerating health, so you can take several thousand bullets over the course of the game but during these duels, well, to quote Ben 'Yahtzee' Crowshaw ""...it's whoever can fire an insta-kill, regenerating cancelling bullet.""  Another reason I find this choice, if not bad, just very weird is that it comes out of no where.  [SPOILER WARNING!] In an early mission, very early, you catch up to a man you are trying to kill and he simply tells his body guard to save him and the guard simply goes ""I know who you are..."" and then the duel starts! Who is this guard? Why is he risking his life for this other guy? [END SPOILER!]As my last word harping on these duels I'll just say their guns are nothing specials.  You might think ""They can one shot you, so their pistol must be something of legends!""  No, sadly.  I lost a late game duel, reloaded, killed the man, walked over to his pistol lying in his corpse's hand.  ""Rusty Quickshooter"" read the weapon's name.  This is easily the weakest weapon in the entire game, and I had died to it in one shot despite the fact that I had been shot by guns similar to this, and stronger, from the millions of goons that the man had sent after me.  Anyway, overall the game is incredibly competent in almost every aspect, although it has the odd desire to be a sandbox but only half commits to it.  TL;DR: If you want a linear western shooter with a decent story and a really weird ""boss-fight"" mechanic, then this is a must-buy, for everyone else, it's a good FPS.8.7/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is truly a hidden gem. I highly recommend to anyone who is considering buying it. The game was more like an interactive movie, and the storyline was very rich (really a great deal to think about and reflect on - long after the game was over.)

												I want to start off by saying, the core gameplay of this is really good.  It flows nice, cover system is a good one, and is mostly enjoyable and understandable. However...Dueling minegame, better than the first game, but still.Storyline gets a bit wacky to say the least.  Lets just say, if you've played the first game, you'll end up being happy that certain characters that died in the first game deserved it after the events in this one.Certain levels just feel out of place, and the sorta free roam aspect in sections is fun, just, feels incomplete.  I give it a resonding MEH overall.  TBH: I did have a lot of fun picking up the gattling guns as Ray, and pretending I was the Heavy from TF2 with the Brass Beast.  That was way over powered, but really, really, fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												***READ THE SYSTEM REQUIRMENTS CAREFULLY!***after scouring the internet I found out this game is plauged with a plethora of problems with all the newer operating systems after the ones listed in the requirments section, I attempted mutiple fixes and none of them worked and am now awaiting my refund due to my system not being able to run this amazing game. overall this game is fantastic, I played it on xbox 360 Orginally and in transfering over to PC gaming I wanted to of course add one of my favorite games (and for 10 dollars? what a deal!). The game is prefect for the fan of westerns, in a way it is like True Grit (the orginal not the redone version) mixed with The Good The Bad The Ugly if you have Red Dead Redemption then you should also have this game. I was really disapointed that the devlopers never came back and patched the game, and I was not about to attempted every fix I read about (one of which involved Reinstalling this game three ""3""times that is the definition of insanity) especially when I already have the game on xbox. for this reason I can not reccomend this game due to my preception that the majority of PC gamers have already moved onto Windows 10 or stayed with Windows 7 and since buying this game for one of those operating systems is such a big gamble even for the cheap price, I'm gonna have to fold on this deal.Caveat Emptor/10			",42,3,1,9,4,0,0

												This is a prequel to the first game in the series and explains the troubles histroy of the family depicted the first time around.  Both games look and play pritty similar, except this time one can choose who to play as. other then that the platforming and stealthing have been removed. Yeeey. This has been replaced by an unneeded money and sandbox system booo. Well there are gunstores where guns with different stats can be bought but since you can grab all guns and ammo you need from the dead it is pointless. And well sandbox is a really liberal interpertation of the word. There are two chapters where you can take on optional missions for more uesless money. The stroy is chliche but he who comes to the western for the innovative story really seems to me like the kind of person whod like to invest in my caribian ski resort. What is interesting about the story however is that it starts during the civil war with the main characters figting for the confederacy. That sound you just heard is the sjw's burning down techland studios.  Other then taking a clear stance against slavery later in the stroy the brothers don't seem to deal with the morality surrounding this fact. An oppertunity was missed somewhere during this first very call of duty inspired level which i liked. The voicework is pritty good all round, in between chapters there is a voiceover telling some the story accompanied by beautyfull still imiges. Of particual note is the voice of Barnsby so the actor gets a shoutout here. Despite all th bad things i said here the game is overall a good experience worth having. Coop would be fun but sadly no. Its just that he good elements of the game are good in a way thats hard to call out. Overall id say this is an enjoyable if not great cowboy game. If your waiting for Red Dead 2 definatly play this.			",302,21,4,48,14,1,38

												If you like the Call of Duty franchise, which is basically an ""on the rails"" action FPS as opposed to an open-world game, and you dig Westerns, you'll probably enjoy Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood. There are some unique aspects that take getting used to, but overall, I am enjoying the and the story. Yes, it's a little bit dated now. I picked it up on sale and it's definitely worth the money paid.			",108,6,0,8,0,2,14

												I have just completed the game not 5 minutes ago. and i'm here to tell you that you should definitely purchase this game. When I was a bit younger I replayed the demo over and over and i probably put at least 50 hours in to the demo. 50 hours of the same level. thats how good that level was to me. Now, for storyline. I will not spoil the story but it was amazing. the end, well, lets not say anything about it. The weapons are really cool. the way they added better versions of each weapon such as rusty, the worst. to regular (has no prefix) to prime (silver coating) to superb (the best) (gold plated). each one of these weapon pefixes improves the previous. Level design. It may not be next gen or anything. but the graphics are pretty decent to say the least. they are playable. I'm not picky with graphics (I still play diablo 2!) but yeah that just about wraps up my first attempt at a ""Professional"" review! Hope you enjoyed it!			",46,7,0,7,5,0,1

												This game acting as pre-quel to the story original in first Call of Juarez, Of how Mccoy brothers came to be and how all of those blood-shed we have witness it the previous game started.   This game will gave you a ""two-side of coin"" story like, almost the same as you have been through in first game, But this time you have a freedom to selecting ""your character"" from the start of every scene and for that, You can double your gameplay time and value as well.   Each character will have their own play style and skill specialize but all will still conclude to the same thing....... Shoot everything in sight. And I say that should already be enough to be considering with.			",132,39,0,11,2,0,4

												Well if you like your FPS shooters, are tired of 2000 rounds per second or the total devastation of a death ray, then may i draw your attention to the call of juarez bound in blood.You play as one of two gun totting characters (choice offered at start of each encounter) in this prequel to its forerunner and name sake, with each bringing different skillsets for the player to choose from. In this outting we see the brothers go from war hero to deserter, from bounty hunter to stone cold killer, all the while leading upto and setting the scene that will challenge the very sanctum of kith and kin. Basically the brothers get wind of news that the yankees are advancing on their homeland so skip out on their miltary duties despite the threat of a firing squad to rescue poor old mammy. Sadly unable to save her with the addition of a possy on their back, the brothers decide to grab their third sibling and head off in search of treasure to rebuild the homestead.As you move through the story you encounter not only out numbered odds but show downs to but the question is as it always is, how much of it actually works and works well while doing it. Well for me im no fan of being corraled into events but what with it being the majority norm for most FPSs was nothing compared to the horrible mechanics of the one on one quick draw. It felt on the controller anyways more about luck than skill and to compound this further its not as though its actually that hard to follow but hey my controllers old so maybe its just me.You get the usual cash for guns or pick them from the dead deal and my personal favourite, riding on horseback but with that said you do get some tender moments with cannons and gattlings but be warned as these arent going to be the death dealers you might have thought they were so make your shots count. While not the best FPS by far this foray will provide lite relief from the more intense incarnations of the genre so if your looking for a little Siesta then look no further. Stand alone prices arent pretty so hold off for a call of juarez steam sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												***WARNING***Windows 8 users beware...On first attempt to run this game I found that the graphics were in a mess, the video was upside down and the in game graphics were corrupted to the point that the game was completely unplayable.After an hour of messing around with settings (Bios) I managed to resolve most of the issues.The game, when running is ok, not good, not great but ok, the whole thing levels out as average.  I found the controls to be rather unresponsive although if the game was worth my time I might adjust those to improve my experience but after a couple of hours play, I'm that bored with the linear play that I just cant be bothered.Would I spend Â£10 on this game knowing what I know now?  NO (Not even Â£1.99)Do I think that the Publisher/Developer/Seller should have more integrity about the issues left unstated before purchase and not leave the consumer to try to resolve basic issues even on older titles? YES (Ubisoft/Techland/Steam)It seems that the issues running under Win 8 are known but the Publisher/Developer have refused to patch or update and leave the user out in the cold, poor show.The game quality should you manage to get the game to run in a playable state is generally poor in my opinion, i'd say that this is the worst FPS i've ever played.  It looks like my quest for a good cowboy style shooter will continue! ",12,0,4,4,5,1,14

												Absolutely love the first one, but in this one they made the abilities less fun to use and (in my opinion) the dueling is absolutely horrible. I get how to do it, but all it is is frustrating and constant. After nearly every mission you have to duel somebody. I put this game down for a long time and decided to try to finish it, and I got close, but so far I can't because the motion blur on the mission is so strong that I can't see anything and I end up dying. This is a problem throughout the game, but it's by far the worst on this last mission. May update if I ever finish the game, but right now I can not recommend. Also the story is alright but kinda meh.*Update*I did eventually beat the final mission, but it took me about twenty times and I shot the ""boss"" less than I had in previous attempts so I'm not really sure how I won. And it wasn't because of headshots because I did literally the exact same thing I did every other time, but the final time it just worked.			",379,68,19,13,39,2,29

												P.S: If You're A Nvidia User And Your System Is Running Windows 7 or 8, Do NOT Buy This Because It Won't Work, All What You Have To Do Is Upgrade To Windows 10 Or Buy An ATI Graphics Card.Bound In Blood Is The Best Call Of Juarez imo, It Feels Like The Original Call Of Juarez But With Improved Gameplay And Graphics, The Story Is So Awesome, It Is Related To The Original CoJ's Story And It's Very Exciting, It Tells Everything That Happened Before Billy's Birth. This Game Is Damn Well Made And It's One Of My Favourite Games Of All Time, So Much Fun To Play I Really Enjoy It Alot, I Recommend It For You Guys, And Well, For A Game Released In 2009 This One Is Mind-Blowy!

I'm playing this game first because it's technically the prequel to the original Call of Jaurez, and I always play games in chronological order. Yes because I'm anal, even with movies/videos so shut the f*ck up.First off it's made by TECHLAND! A game company JUST AS BAD as Spark Unlimited (whom made Legendary [$0.98], Turning Point - Fall of Liberty [$1.22], and other god awful pieces of sh*t!). Techland developed Dead Island, a terrible bugged flaw because those idoit Ukrainian's (I'm Ukrainian and I'm offended to know them) can't develop games WORTH SH*T! They then created Dyling Light, I've been scared to play it, and apparently it burns out your computer like Watch Dogs. Not surprising at all...Anyways, this game is a wild west first person shooter. So it has the elements of Red Dead Redemtion, and Call of Duty 2. To be honest, it's actually a FUNCTIONAL GAME!? :OThere's even combat hiding elements where you can peek over corners like in Crysis, that's pretty neat sh*t.I'm really shocked, if they can make this an ACTUAL game, Techland should stick with linear based shooters AND NOT OPEN WORLD NON-OPTIMIZED PIECES OF FILTH DIARRHEA!The storyline is interesting, the character development is very well done.I'm actually, like, stunned. It's the same feeling the Angry Video Game Nerd has when he plays the first good LJN game. It's, a miracle!When you kill enough enemies you build up a ""rage-meter"" to slow down time and execute any enemies you see. The only thing that doesn't make sense is that the ""rage-meter"" is timed when it's full so it forces you to use it or you loose it. Even if there's no enemies around??I would actually recommend this game, especially if you like Call of Duty 2 and western shooters. Even if it's Techland.Now... I go on to play the original. Lord have mercy on my soul.7/10 ",774,159,33,63,61,3,97

												Bound in Blood doesn't inherently have any glaring issues, it's just a monotonous game. I had to force myself to sit through the entire campaign and finish as many side missions as possible. If only this game had some kind of leveling, upgrade or weapon system to keep the gameplay fresh. Unfortunately, over the course of the entire game, the only ""upgrades"" in weaponry you really get are the exact same models of the guns you already have but with +1 damage or +1 accuracy.The rest of the gameplay is decent, but not nearly compelling enough to warrant a purchase for anything over $2.99 in my opinion. tl;dr Decently made game, but too dull and repetitive for me to recommend.

												If you want a game where you'll learn the Polish stereotype about â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s being incredibly stupid,buy this game. You'll see how a bunch of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ with non-functional brain have managed to create a game a bunch of chimps could've made better. If you think that your life is worth nothing,and you want to waste as much time as humanely possible,buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really enjoyed the first game, but this one feels like it was primarily made for consoles. Old school gamers might hate these dumbed down versions.I played it for about 30 minutes and just couldn't bare it anymore.I'm sure it has a great story and all, but i rather play the game, not the story:-guided gameplay, assisted aiming, no control when you want to use focus (slow motion),..I guess this game is meant for the newer generation of gamers.So if you dislike console games ported to PC, you might want to avoid this one.

												A game that starts off decently but never gets any better (and in some cases, gets much worse). The duel system ranges from boring to broken, the combat is fun and buying new guns is nice, but there's not a lot of depth there and many levels are just combat room after combat room. The story is pretty good and a nice prequel to the first Call of Juarez game, and the music/sounds are exceptional.Overall I'd say it's about a 6/10 game; don't necessarily avoid it, but buy it on sale and only if you don't have a giant backlog.

												Horrible voice acting, painful narration cutscenes, awful story - CoJ: Bound in Blood is just simply a dumb game. Gameplay is repetitive and boring, and the showdowns that conclude every level feel exactly same, each as broken and tedious as the last. The only thing that makes the game even remotely interesting is the choice to play as one of the two brothers in the game: Thomas is good with a bow and arrow, Ray can use dynamite, and each has their own version of a slowed down focus mode.Unfortunately it's not enough to make Bound in Blood worth playing. Save yourself the frustration and just pick up or replay Red Dead Redemption.			",334,63,8,45,21,3,37

												Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood is a hidden gem when it comes to a gripping and tense storyline. It is a classical Drama with very interesting and deep characters and several unexpected turns. Nevertheless, it suffers from some flaws. The first two acts, for instance, are rather dull and don't show much character development. I know that they are supposed to be the exposition, but personally, I stopped playing the game in act 2 and only picked it up months later to give it a second chance and to be totally blown away by the following acts. I'd pretty much like to go into a lot more detail, especially concerning the ""open world"" bits and some small missed opportunities, especially regarding the ending, but seeing that Steam has harsh restrictions concerning length, I'll have to stop here. So if you like a shooter with a great storyline, check out Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood. You won't regret it.			",218,43,3,57,35,3,73

Poor game mechanics, poor graphics for the time (2009), poor shooting mechanics (for a Western game that's one thing you HAVE to get right), poor storyline and characters. I wanted to be done with this game on level 3. The shakey cam just about gave me sea sickness - I almost had to take Dramamine. The picking of one of the two brothers doesn't want me to play it again to see the other paths and the ""secrets"" are dull and not worth getting. Ugh, I don't know how the scores for this game were as high as they were. Avoid at all costs - crappy, boring, and poor. Final Grade - F			",161,8,1,17,4,0,27

												This is a game about how Gul Dukat is a womanizer and keeps going after the different women-species' of Earth. despite his brother's near-constant meddling. I like the story for the most part, but at length Bound in Blood falls short where Gunslinger does not, and thus I would choose the latter over the two. Still, Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood is a fairly cheap buy and a fun bit of Wild West action.			",55,20,0,16,2,0,7

												The good- The action is fun, using old western guns is nice for a change from the MW clones- There is a story- I would have been bored after more than 6 hours so I'm glad it wasn't any longerThe bad- The voice acting annoyed me- It gets very repetitive- Too many invasive cut scenes slow the game down heaps.If you have 6 hours spare, and if you can get it cheap, give it a go.

												El salvaje oeste. Ãpoca de pistoleros, duelos al sol y mucha mala leche. ""Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood"" nos sumerge en ella, en un videojuego que se antoja como una gran experiencia western mÃ¡s que en el aparente fps que nos adentrarÃ¡ en la historia planteada por los chicos de Techland. Si piensas que eres un tipo duro y que podrÃ­as hacerle frente a los McCall, te has equivocado de ""hijos de perra"".

												This game is awesome if you like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ comedy - running with the six gun was classic, that's about as far as I got into this abortion.  It was kind of hard, actually - I even thought about giving it another shot, that it might get good if you somehow got the hang of it.  But the graphics were primitive, the combat seemed â¥â¥â¥â¥ed, and the guy yelling at you in corny western accents that no one ever had back then was annoying.  I folded after the second wave of baddies in that first gunfight near the beginning of the game.  I was having way too much trouble giving a crap enough to keep playing, is maybe one way to put it.

												This is the first game i've tried from the Call of Juarez series and I gotta say, I found this game to be pretty enjoyable to say the least. I got the game on sale, thinking ""its probably not that good but why not"" and now I can safely say I was wrong. First off, the gameplay itself was surprisingly smooth. The way your character holds the gun when firing from cover was really satisfying. I expected below average gunplay but i'll admit it is fairly good. No actual gore system in the game (boo!) but it made up for that by making it satisfying to see someone get shot. I've noticed very few bugs so far. I guess the gameplay is slightly above average, compared to most fps shooters ive played. The main story missions were pretty varied and werent that repetitive (save for the first couple of levels, those were painfully dull), but almost all the side missions had the same exact level structure. Go to area, fight a number of bandits or enemies, bandit leader offers a duel, win duel, get reward.The graphics, for a game from 2009, were alright. Nothing special, but nothing too fancy either. Characters are highly detailed compared to everything else, and the guns skins also. Scenery is actually quite fancy in this game, with views of mountains, cliffs and forests that were pleasing to the eye.Umm... as for the story, well it is a bit bland, and somewhat cliche, but at the same time, each level ending was kindof a cliffhanger to the next which did keep me playing to find out what happens next. A few of the lines were badly written, a few of the plot twists were predictable, and a few of the jokes were corny (and also the damn ""Yeehaa!""-ing was annoying) but it was decent enough story-wise. My biggest complaint would be that some characters were waaaay too cliche and boring. Voice acting wasnt exactly great either.One thing that was really cool, was that the two main characters had different skill sets (one was a close range tank brawler, the other was more of a long range and stealth kinda fighter) and you could play most levels as either character (replayability ding!) and that one character could duel wield pistols, the other could throw knives, etc. It was a fairly balanced skill set, however i found myself tending to pick the close range brother more often (maybe he was a bit OP compared to his long range bro) but both offered some unique gameplay aspects and i would often play differently depending on which character i chose. Even though this is a single player game, this two character skill set often screamed co-op, which leads me to doubt why the developers didnt add co-op into this.All in all, great western fps. I would recomend if you're into this sort of thing. 7/10  ",116,5,4,8,4,0,13

												This game is a prequel to the 1st game Call of Juarez. You can play as either one of the 2 brothers Thomas and Ray. They each both have unique sets of gameplay. Thomas can use his rope, climb ledges, and is great in long range weapons. Ray can duel wield revolvers and use dynamite. What character you choose does not affect the linear storyline. Multiplayer is dead since Ubisoft cut their servers few years ago and not alot of people play it.Is there mods? Yes a few that are right now on mod db.Custom Maps? Yes at the time Ubisoft welcomed mappers with open arms but its only for multiplayer which is useless now.Rate: 9/10Note: I recommend players to buy this game when's on sale ($2.49) since buying under $10 is a ripoff.

												While the game has it's moments, the mechanics are poorly ported to the PC.  Using the mouse and keyboard the duels feel awkward and luck based rather then skill based.  The difficulty requires you to play on hard mode which is a poor step up from normal.  Still a good vlaue for the price, if you don't have a controler to play the duels, skip it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was a splendid surprise. I got it in a pack with Far Cry 2...and another Ubisoft game (can't remember what it was). But Bound in Blood sat in my library for the longest time until I finally just decided to play it. And it is a blast! The theme of Wild West is done really well from the environments to the characters to the gunslinging. I love the showdown mechanics they use even if it does get a tad easy to figure them out once you understand the cues. The automatic cover system can get a bit annoying at times, but at the same time I liked it. I suppose they do have an option to shut that off if you don't like that though. The story itself is really well-done, especially for a shooter. I loved the comradery between the two brothers. They have some rather funny trade-offs. All in all...play this game. It's awesome.

Some issues though - the mission system to collect bounties needs to be expanded as they were a lot of fun but sadly limited. Similarly - did anyone ever pick the older brother after giving both a go? Boss fights were mostly guess work - but as I say, I really fun game to play through to the end.			",86,4,0,11,1,2,23

												Authentic, believable, and abseloutely faithful to the ways of the old west, Bound in Blood is the most realistic and complete FPS experience of the old world to date. All the guns, buildings, attires, accents and entities are expertly recreated. The graphics are the breakthrough variety that helped inspire games like Crysis 2 and Far Cry 3. The gameplay is top notch. Concentration mode is improved upon from the previous Call of Juarez and lets the game perform the shooting once you've picked out the targets with Ray, or use  the mouse properly with Thomas.In terms of story, Bound in Blood delivers a compelling adventure, a riveting quest for glory and restoration mixed with greed and betrayal. A little short and the end could have been extended, but a game worth the both the money and the effort needed to play it.However, history buffs, beware, the Colt single action army  used in the game hadn't been invented yet, nor had the Winchester model you see in the game. Bound in Blood is somewhat inaccurate in terms of time period weapons, but they're well designed, nonetheless.			",265,7,1,7,6,0,35

												This game is a prequel to the 1st game Call of Juarez. You can play as either one of the 2 brothers Thomas and Ray. They each both have unique sets of gameplay. Thomas can use his rope, climb ledges, and is great in long range weapons. Ray can duel wield revolvers and use dynamite. What character you choose does not affect the linear storyline. Multiplayer is dead since Ubisoft cut their servers few years ago and not alot of people play it.Is there mods? Yes a few that are right now on mod db.Custom Maps? Yes at the time Ubisoft welcomed mappers with open arms but its only for multiplayer which is useless now.Rate: 9/10Note: I recommend players to buy this game when's on sale ($2.49) since buying under $10 is a ripoff.

If you like shooters or Westerns it's well worth picking up. Only downside was that I played Call of Juarez Gunslinger first which kinda overshines this one.Oh, and saw lots of reports about video problems. The opening cinematic was upside-down for me but the rest was fine. No complaints.			",390,111,14,46,23,7,30

												A western-style first person shooter.  You can play as one of two characters - but Ray is no fun so you can really only enjoy playing as Thomas.

You can play as either Thomas or Ray, I liked playing more as Ray cuz you can run in guns a blazing and dual pistol your way through all sorts of baddies. 7.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was a splendid surprise. I got it in a pack with Far Cry 2...and another Ubisoft game (can't remember what it was). But Bound in Blood sat in my library for the longest time until I finally just decided to play it. And it is a blast! The theme of Wild West is done really well from the environments to the characters to the gunslinging. I love the showdown mechanics they use even if it does get a tad easy to figure them out once you understand the cues. The automatic cover system can get a bit annoying at times, but at the same time I liked it. I suppose they do have an option to shut that off if you don't like that though. The story itself is really well-done, especially for a shooter. I loved the comradery between the two brothers. They have some rather funny trade-offs. All in all...play this game. It's awesome.

I have since added the 1st, and the recently released 3rd game to my wishlist, and will be picking them up eventually.A well done FPS set in the post civil war era south-west and old Mexico.

												Unfortunatelly - ConfusingIf you have modern PC (WIN 7 and later), go to the two last paragraphs:Recommended:!!! WARNING: WinXP and VISTA ONLY !!!!!Nice game, especially when western games are so rare. Solid story, good gameplay, no hi-tech M-16's/M4's. My complain is, that special weapons (bow etc.), ""bullet time"" and abilty of one character to climb roofs and obstacles are far from its full potential:- You are fighting in the street of mexican village, perfect place to climb the roofs and shoot the bad guys from there - and you cannot do that. You climb the place and there is invisible barrier, that throws you down. - ""Bullet time"" is great when there is group of enemies - but on hard difficulty (which is not difficult at all if you are used to play FPS), you are killed before you get to the range- some weapons are hard to get, or too late in-game, so I greatly recommend this mod:http://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood-realism-mod/downloads/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood-realism-modIt tweaks weapon a little bit, but especially fills the inventory in shops. Recommendation: If you want to enjoy the game and add more challenge, skip the lever-action rifle and use double barrel shotgun or single shot (sharps rifle) instead. Mod above makes it much easier to get them. Instead of wiping out group of enemies in almost no time it changes the fight in one-by-one, man-to-man miniduels. Switch to revolver, when ambushed by group of bad boys in small space - thats what they are for. WIN7 and higher:ALMOST impossible to play. On Win7 x64 Ultimate it crashes within minutes of the gameplay and not only crashes - it completely shuts down my computer. I have no idea what about older systems, but the new ones are doomed.I have tryed every solution, I have found - compatibility modes, sound changes etc. - to no effect.Conclusion: A) If you have PC with older OS, it may be game for you - I enjoyed it a lot.B) If you have more up-to-date system, think twice, whether you are willing to buy, install and try something, that has high chances to never work for you.

												Not a perfect game,but still a bit of fun If you can get it on special. . Graphics are still nice,particularly If you can tweak it in your graphics control panel. At the start of each act,you can choose which of the 2 brothers you wish to play as,each with slightly different weapons and approaches . Good amount/variation of weapons that feel satisfying when used to get a kill (also get to use a canon and gatling gun). Different surroundings and settings which are fitting of each scenario. Great story,with a good twist. Fun gameplay once you get the hang of it,different mechanics like cover,slow-mo's and duels. A nice addition of side missions in a limited free roam setting in between the main campaign that I wasn't expecting,but was welcome. Voice acting isn't professional,some voices don't suit or are lacking enough emotion,but still acceptable. Short campaign,but I think that it was the perfect length as any more may have dragged on and got boring. AI is mostly good,darting/ducking about all over the place,but you do get a random straggler moving randomly or not doing much at allI strongly recommend playing it at easy on your first playthrough,and thats mainly because of the duels and other play variations. The first time I played this (offline),I was stuck on the 3rd duel,and could not pass it no matter how hard I tried. It sort of ruined the game and I put it down for over a year before picking it up again (no online save either). 2nd time around I played it on easy and while I cruised through it (a few deaths on each of the duels),I feel I'd have much better chance of beating them on a higher difficulty now. It will also give you a better chance of getting used to the cover and slow-mo mechanics,whilst immersing yourself in the story and theme.			",377,32,23,25,24,9,10

												This is a very good game. The singleplayer shows the past of a character from the orginal game, Call of Juarez. After losing the civil war, the Mccall brothers return to their home to see that it has been wrecked and their mother has died the night before. The brothers become outlaws and eventually hear about the gold of Juarez. Will the brothers find it or will they fall prey to who's been on it's trail already? Now the multiplayer. The multiplayer is real good,it has so many classes I cant even name or number them. It's alright if you dont mind the gay announcer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
