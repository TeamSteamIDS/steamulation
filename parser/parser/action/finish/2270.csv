												I've played this game probably over 5000 hours total since I first booted it up on my grandparents IBM Compatible 486 with Turbo (88hz) using the floppy drive.I spent countless hours over the summer playing it til my grandpa wanted to puke from being sea-sick with all my turning around and checking walls for hiddent passages and rooms. I remember he would draw maps of the rooms and mark where he found treasure and health etc.  It was always thrilling finding dog food and ammo hidden behind a Hitler portrait or giant Swastika.  I always knew something big was about to happen whenever the brick color changed from grey to red or blue.The high quality 3D graphics are only surpassed by the excellent sound effects and soundtrack. I HIGHLY recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a living piece of history, with all the good and bad that comes with it.The main issue this game has is that it's not from the world ""Doom"" and the like comes from. It has half a foot still in the ""atari, beep boop, life and point system"" ground, and this becomes obvious after trying to 100% any given level. All the maps look very, very similar, it beccomes difficult to tell WHERE you are without the use of the map, and in general it's insanely difficult to play the game to the full potential it deserves.The vast majority of the secrets are hidden among identical looking walls, gameplay boils down to corner camping the basic ai, and there's really, really not much to say, since the entire game is a basic package with nothing more than basic floor layout with only right angles, and the sound is nothing but muffled sound effects they could pull off at the time with a small group of midi's used repeatedly (space on floppy drives was incredibly small) for atmosphere.Despite all this, the game DOES get a free pass simply for being so stooped in history. Without this game, you wouldn't have the vast majority of FPS we have now. If you want to buy this to know your roots, go ahead, but be warned, it's about as odd as a time capsule could be.

												YOU KILL NAZIS 10/10 No seriously heres my review:Remember those times when you had to put up with modern fps games holding your godamn hand all the time? Well drown those terrible memories of 6 year olds calling you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with some Wolfenstein 3D. Some of you have probably played it back in the 90s. If you have, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR BUY IT RIGHT FREAKING NOW!!!! As for those who haven't played it, I'll tell you about the game. It's world war 2 and you are a dude who has been captured by the Nazis and has been taken to Castle Wolfenstein. You start inside a room with a Nazis corpse and then you go and ""Get yo self some Nazi scalps"". But heres what makes this game better than modern fps games. There aren't any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t things like having to put up with some stupid scenario where you have to walk slow for 30 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes (*cough* *cough* Call Of Duty), instead you get to get right into the action without any delays. There are tons of secrets to find and so much fun to be had with this game. The levels are so open and it's like any other old school shooter. Kill some dudes, look for secrets, find keys to open doors and complete the levels. If you are a fan of first person shooters, give this game a shot.			",210,23,2,20,12,0,23

												Background: I first played this game on a 486 back in the 90s.This is a great game, but if you compare it to new games, or even a Doom type game it will look very primitive.  You will also be missing the point of how important this was to the history of FPS games. The game is simple to pick up, hard to master.  To master the toughest difficulty, I am Death Incarnate, you will need some good FPS skills, good choice of knowing when to use each type of weapon and some level knowledge.    The game is also has a good element of skill to it.  The closer you are, the more likely you are to hit as well as get hit.  You can also take a lot more damage up close so you have to be careful going through doorways and in tight spaces.There are secrets to find, treasure to pick up, par times to bet, Hitler to kill, and a ton of Nazis to mow down on the way.  The game even lets you hold MORE THAN TWO GUNS AT ONCE! :P  However there are only two weapons you will use long term, the grey machine gun which has great economy with the bullets and a decent rate of fire.  There is also the gatling gun which never gets tiring to use.  It has an amazing sound, an amazing red flash on the screen and watching your ammo quickly depleting makes you realise just how powerful it is.For a perfectionist this game is great, at the end of each level you are rated on what % you kill, what % of the secrets you found and how much of of the nazi loot you confiscated. Back in the 90s I spent a lot of time carefully walking around every wall holding down space waiting to hear the magical sound of a new secret passage opening.  The the excitement of wondering if I've found just a block of ammo, or maybe a crapload of treasure.The game has 6 episodes, each with 9 levels + a secret level on each episode.GET PSYCHED!

												Classic old school shooting with some maze like layouts here and there which can tend to be a bit frustrating. This game is basically Doom's older brother and should be played by anyone with an interest in FPS games. It runs perfectly in Dosbox and the Steam Version is probably the best version out there at the moment.Full video review:

 Note: This game was played on a source port called ECWolf[maniacsvault.net] and I wholeheartedly recommend downloading it to better your experience with the game, adding a few modern features, more resolutions, and turning off the Y-axis so moving the mouse forward doesn't make you move forward as well. I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume most people have heard of Wolfenstein 3D already, but just in case someone hasn't here is a brief history.Though not being the absolute first of its kind, Wolfenstein 3D is a game highly regarded as the progenitor of the first-person shooter genre, created by id Software in 1992, no mater what anyone may say about how good the game is or not these days, it at least has to be respected for the creation of one of the most prolific video game genres to date.You play as William Joseph ""B.J."" Blazkowicz, a Polish American spy sent on a mission to find out the nazi's plans and stop them, which usually means climbing nine floors and murdering someone at the top or bottom, along the way killing S.S. troops and undead mutants.As you can tell, the story is not really all that important, as famed programmer for id John Carmack once said, and I quote, ""Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It's expected to be there, but it's not that important."" So given this mentality you can pretty much write off the story as just a means to let you shoot stuff, and this was back before most games even bothered to put effort in their plotlines to start with.So that means onto the gameplay, ever played a first-person shooter before? Well then you will fit right at home, the game is simple as far as controls and objectives, you walk around and only are able to look left and right, fighting in stages of block shaped rooms and mazes, looking for keys and doors to get you to the final switch, pulling it and moving onto the next level, there are six episodes and each one has nine levels and one hidden map that is gotten to by finding a hidden elevator in one of the stage, totaling sixty levels in all there is actually a lot of game here.You have three gun types and a knife, though the guns all use the same ammo counter and about the same damage except each one shoots faster then the one before it, levels are sometimes straightforward, and sometimes mazes you must run through, most of the level design is fun and varied up to a point, given they don't have very much to work with other then walls, floors, and sometimes hanging moss.The big question is if it is worth playing, and actually even today, over twenty years after its creation, it is still fun to play, sure it is simple and chances are not anything you haven't seen before from more modern shooters, but it has that old retro charm to it that is hard to explain, it is bright and colorful, has treasure and arcade-like qualities such as lives and a score, and despite how old and dated it seems, I still believe it is worth taking a look at.

												Best game I've ever played, truly the spectacle of blue bricks and pure gold door handles on each well made passage makes this game really stand out as a true contender in the videogames industry, even monster companies like Blizzard, Sony, and Volvo, would never be able to rise above the mountain high expectation this game has raised.   As it stands it's also fairly historically accurate as every door in Germany was either forged of pure Blue Titanium metal mixed in with the dreams of orphans, or was finely crafted of pure 8040k gold, the German's great looking superior uniforms are revealed in stunning Dos'Box simulation of German super computer graphics they had available before the world ended in 2012.   I highly recommend that you buy multible copies for yourself and all of your friends so that you and everyone else can hear the words: Hitler was right.			",111,9,1,23,8,0,22

 Wolfenstein 3D  The ever so reliable grandad. 1992 ID software released the ""Progenitor of First Person Shooters"", it is still remembered as one of the greatest classical games of all time. I resently played this using one of its numerous ports, namely ECWolf. It added support for several control schemes much like in a modern shooter, giving me a good reason to jump back in and play it.And bhoyo.. Was it hard. I almost immediately cranked the difficulty to ""Death Incarnate"" and I have currently blasted through 5 of the 6 total episodes and during that time of pixelated and very profound carnage, I realised something.I was enjoying the game. It was a rather strange feeling, mostly due to not having it happen in a long while. The last game that I remember doing it was Mafia and yes, I realise that it is an entirely different game and it is very narrative driven, but I enjoyed it. Something that cannot be said from some of the games I have resently reviewed. (Fkng Bureau..)Anyway, back to the matter at hand.Although Wolfenstein 3D has aged, it still looks great. There is something about this early-age of computing graphics, that is just amazing. The way they had to work with hardware limitations, limited colours and not to mention floppy drives. Ughh.. I tell you, I resently got one of those cheap USB ones and I suddenly remembered how moody those fkrs are.Where was I? Oh yes.. Even with the age of the game, its pixely graphics and all. It still manages to stay relevant, even after 23-Years. Let's think on that number there for a minute.. 23, a lifetime ago for some people. Including me and for everyone who grew up during the 90's.I keep digressing, I apoligize. But this is partly why people appreciate these games, they are part of their past, their childhood and that is just way too important to ignore.Let's talk about the actual game a little bit, now that I've got the nostalgia chip off my shoulder.The game is an FPS, I can't really explain more than that. It is the most basic of things, get gun, find secret, get bigger gun, kill everything.The game is silly, very much so and it does not give a f**k. The story is the most basic of basics, yet again.The biggest issue that I have with the game, is the level layouts, they are mazes. I remember a wonderfull story of being stuck in one level for a day, just because I could not find the door and to make it better, there is no map system. Hee,hee everyone dies.. 8D There is very little that can be said about the game besides these two things, yet again, it is the first. I know that tere are other FPS games before Wolf3D, but this is the one everyone remembers so.. Meh.I don't think I need to pad this out any longer, I think you got what I'm saying here, right?But to recap.Wolfenstein 3D is a worthwile classic. Even for something of its age, it manages to stay entertaining. The modding and source-port community keeps the game alive, there are numerous mods on sites like ModDB. That can be used to enhance the experience or change it completely. I would highly recommend the ECWolf mod, it is easy to install and only reguires a copy of the game files found in the program folder. Similiar to Brutal Doom in that respect.The game can take a good number of hours to finish, even with the mods making it more playable. But the enjoyment is there and for those brave enough to go-a-romping through Castle Wolfenstein,stay calm,keep a gun handy,and always eat the dog-food when at low health.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The year was 1995 and I was in 8th grade. I had a friend who spent many of his class periods in separate classes for “developmentally challenged students” (It wasn’t me, I promise). Basically the special teachers would give the special students the answers to tests and do their homework for them so they wouldn’t fail and bring the class GPA down. Anyway, somehow I was able to sneak away from normal kid study hall to go hang out with my buddy every day, and because his school assignments were handed to him on a silver platter, we had all sorts of time to play “educational games” on the school’s nifty Macintosh computer. Back in those days Mac wasn’t exactly known for having enjoyable games, and the school had enough sense to purchase only games that no one would want to play. Titles such as “Wacky Jacks”, “Sim Tower”, and “Dr. Quandry” were the 3 gems we had to choose from. Why all of this non-Wolfenstein related talk? Well I’m getting to that, you see, while the educational powers that be may have done their best to sanitize our academic computer usage of any fun, they overlooked one small detail. One of the games came with a demo to Wolfenstein3D. We loaded that thing up, and study hall forevermore turned into a Nazi bloodbath. The Demo only allowed us to play up to the elevator on the 1st floor, but we killed every last Nazi and found every secret on that level, and once we flipped that lever we would do it all over again. But don’t think for one second that I didn’t learn anything. It became apparent to me after several level one playthroughs that the Nazis lost WWII due to poor resource management. The amount of Hitler tapestries and Nazi flags that adorn the compound hallways must have cost a fortune, imagine if that money had been put into the war effort? The construction of secret passage ways couldn’t be cheap either, and the amount of gold, firearms, and ammunition just sitting around on the ground collecting dust might have been devastating had the Nazis implemented their use against the Allies. Turns out the Nazis fit in perfectly in re-tard study hall after-all. Mein Leben! AIEEeee!!			",85,53,2,29,2,2,8

												Wolfenstein 3D has been the first computer FPS game I ever played.I remember the first moment. From the own eyes of the main hero. Alone, starving, armed only with a bread knife in deep complex of enemy territory.The guard came checking my cell and that was my moment to pounce him, open his throat with old rusty dull piece of utensil and equip his gun with a few bullets.Now it was only me versus the Sea of Troubles. Expecting the fear in every corner and recon every bullet I shot and scavenge. the long way to escape to freedom through army of blood filled uniformed and armed flesh bags. The Sea was colored in blood.I bought the game (to be honest for the first time) on steam and thought how old and nostalgic it will suck, after all games I've played after. In the first executing level. The pistol in the hand and bloody guard body in front of me, everything came back like vietnam veteran's flashbacks. This game is still awesome.			",101,17,1,12,9,2,8

												It's just plain Wolfenstein 3D. Blast from the past.Never gets old.Tip: if you want a little bit smoother framerate, just press CTRL+F12 few times until you feel comfortable.Too much? CTRL+F11. CPU cycles 6000 is enough. DOSBox things....If someone not satisfied, just search for the other engines (NewWolf, WolfenDOOM EDGE, Wolf4SDL etc)			",1071,225,88,73,70,9,128

												Go Way Way Back into the 90's...Further...There! I Barely Remember playing this Back, Yet I wasn't even born when It came out. But It still had a Following When I Had better knowledge, And Killing Nazi's Was Exactly what My Father would have wanted me to do at the age of 11 or 12. Right?Probably Not, But killing Nazi's, Dogs, and Hitler in a Mech With Twin Gatling-Guns Back then was ""Almost"" Easy. In This Prophet of the Monsterkill Genre of Video Games, It is Considered Crude, And I agree, Between Killing Soldiers you would get either ""Meh!"" Or ""ayeee"", Eating Dog Food (which was personally awesome), and Just watching Guard Dogs attack me from the Behind With No indication What so ever. Between all of that, I Still Consider it! 4.99 Was A Steal.But, The Controls is what I was most Frustrated about. Using the Arrow keys to look around and move at the same time, And Ctrl to Shoot or Stab, And Space as the Action Key. All the Controls of a Free Online ""Video Game"". It was Highly Uncomfortable and Made me want to stop playing after 5 Minutes. But Even 6 Minutes Passed And I started getting the hang of it, But I was still running into walls other than Dashing Through Hidden Hitler Posters. It was still a Great Addition to my Library! And without Wolfenstein, There wouldn't be many Shooters...like...Call of Duty (yay?). So I just want to give a Big thanks Real Quick.Thank You Nazis!			",90,7,0,6,7,2,3

												Kids these days may complain about the graphics being crappy or about how the gameplay is and there not being a map, but back when I was a kid, these were the best graphics you had. Way back when killing Germans wasn't racist or bad, this game was the most entertaining thing on the computer. It's really no different than playing something like DOOM or Quake.			",2,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The original FPS classic. Make no mistake, Wolfenstein 3D is very dated and has aged poorly in comparison to its sibling DOOM. Lacking even the touches of that game, it really is kind of like Pac-Man with guns.It was also an important historical landmark that put FPS games on the map and set the stage for a lot of what was to come in the genre, as well as ensuring the success of id Software after establishing themselves with the kid-friendly Commander Keen games. These days it's a little hard to believe the game was genuinely shocking in 1992, a time when the ESRB didn't even exist!If you can deal with the sometimes labyrinthine levels, stark texturing, somewhat out-of-place lives/scoring system (the ability to save anywhere makes it moot) and play in chunks to offset the monotony, you'll find a minimalist shooter that rewards tactical thinking as much as it does all-out action. It's a game that ostensibly pushes macho badassery and then puts you in situations that pushes your ""badassery"" to the breaking point[ellaguro.blogspot.com].If you're interested, I would recommend using the ECWolf[maniacsvault.net] sourceport instead of the DOSBox emulation you get here. ECWolf gives you modern controls and an automap if you're hopelessly stuck. Steam's DOSBox emulation for games is generally poor quality anyway; what you're really paying for are the actual game files, so you might as well use ECWolf if you ask me. Consult this guide to integrate ECWolf into Steamworks so it'll show you as playing the game.If you somehow want even more classic Wolfenstein, the Spear of Destiny prequel features a condensed official campaign - which is good - and two third-party campaigns that aren't really good.

Quick Breakdown: A revolutionary game that helped create the FPS genre proper (there were some iterations of it prior to this). It’s still decent fun, and mandatory playing for anyone interested in the history of video games. It hasn’t aged very well, but still serves as a worthy distraction for a few hours.Length: 3 Hours (Main game), 6-7 (Main + extras)Genre: FPSScore: 6/10Review Date: 2016-07-08Note: The control scheme for this game is pretty dated, I modded it to use more modern controls. I’ll include a link to the source port I used, as well as instructions on what I did at the end of the review.*******************************************************************************************************Full Review: Sometimes you get so used to things just existing that going back to their roots feels like stepping into another world. FPS games technically existed in various highly primitive forms prior to 1992’s Wolfenstein 3D (W3D), but the giant leap forward in gaming that this was may as well have been the start of the genre. At the least, it was the start of the genre proper.Playing the game for the first time nearly 25 years later it’s a bit difficult to truly appreciate what W3D did games. Even compared to Doom released only a year later, W3D feels primitive. And indeed it is, though that’s not entirely a bad thing since it’s still a fun romp. You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, who must escape from a Nazi prison known as Castle Wolfenstein. After doing so, you continue your fight against the Nazis. Set in first person, the game plays only on a level playing field. There’s no crosshair for your weapon, there’s not even variation in the height of the level. You can walk, run, open doors, and shoot. That’s about it, you can’t even look up or down (not that it’s needed here).Gun types are pretty basic as well, with each new gun essentially just shooting faster. You start with a basic pistol, and can pick up a machine gun, and then later a Gatling chain gun. Each gun uses the same ammo, this is before different guns had different ammos. You also have a knife for melee combat, though I never used it during the game.The controls for the game are pretty dated, you walk forward and back, and can turn. Mouse support and strafing need to be modded in to the game. This will also grant you unlimited save slots. Modding it will also allow you to use the Steam overlay, which enables you to take screenshots. (I’ll talk about what I did to mod the game at the end, it’s nothing fancy).Enemies in the game consist of various Nazi troops, and there’s not a whole lot of variety there. Bosses don’t have too much variety either, but you do get to fight Mecha-Hitler, and killing him is a special kind of satisfying.The game features lives, which is a bit odd since you can save the game at any point and reload from there, which is what I did any time I bite the dust. You earn points from collecting treasure scattered about each level, after accumulating enough points you earn extra lives. It’s a small way in which the game shows it’s age.This version of the game consists of 6 chapters, each containing 10 levels (1 level in each is a secret level, none of which I bothered with). The original game only consisted of the first 3 chapters, and will take you around 3 hours to run through. Later releases of the game included an additional 3 chapters (included here). It’ll take about 6-7 hours to complete all 6 chapters.Level design consists of navigating corridors and champers filled with enemies, dead ends, and keys that must be used to unlock doors. The end of each level is marked by an elevator, that when activated completes the level and takes you to the next one. The quality of the level design is a bit inconsistent, some being quite a bit of fun, others being a labyrinthine maze that descends into an exercise in tedium (most of chapter 4). The more combat based portions of the game are among the stronger ones (I think it was chapter 5 that did this well).Levels can get pretty repetitive, and the game would’ve benefitted from some trimming, since better level design wasn’t too likely given that this is a genre in its infancy. As such, I can’t be too critical of it for this, but it’s still a negative.Despite its flaws and heavily dated nature, Wolfenstein 3D is still decent fun. Worthwhile if you’re interested in old school FPS games. It has a sequel called Spear of Destiny if you’re craving more levels, though don’t expect anything fantastic there. Both, along with a third game, Return To Castle Wolfenstein, is available for a mere $10. It’s probably the best way to stretch your dollar. (RTCW is a sequel from 2001, though I’ve yet to play through that one).*******************************************************************************************************Modding Instructions: So for modding, I didn’t do anything fancy or complicated. Here’s a step by step guide:1). Download the ECWolf source port, it’s what I used, and it’s all I needed for this game. It’s based off the ZDoom mod for the Doom games, and works with Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny, and Super 3D Noah’s Ark (wtf). You can download ECWolf here[maniacsvault.net].2). You need to navigate to a certain folder in your Wolfenstein directory. Since you downloaded it off Steam, by default that’ll be:C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Wolfenstein 3D\baseCopy paste that into Windows Explorer/File Explorer and it should take you there. If not, copy paste the following:%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Steam\SteamApps\common\Wolfenstein 3D\baseIf neither of those work, you’ll have to find where you saved it since you’re not using the default location.3). That ECWolf  you downloaded in step 1? Copy/paste the zip folder it gave you into the location from step 1. Then unzip/extract all the contents of that folder into the folder from step 1. (the Wolfenstein 3D\base folder).4). In the same folder, look for something named “dosbox.exe” and rename it to “Steamdosbox.exe”.5). Still in the same folder, look for “ecwolf.exe” and rename it to “dosbox.exe”.Congrats! You’ve now modded your game to feature more modern controls, better key bindings, unlimited saves, and you can use the Steam overlay while in game now. The game is still launched through Steam normally, and it’ll still track your playtime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The father of all First Person Shooters. Although not id Software's first FPS, it certainly paved the way for a long-running succession of amazing games over the years. id's passion for details makes this game a valuable piece in every gamer's collection.Just imagine that in 1992 all offices in the world still worked on text-only interfaces, However, id Software came out with a game that further extended previous FPS's capabilities, such as 256 colors (instead of 16), textures, incredible sounds, voices, an excellent music that immerses you in the gameplay and sets the perfect mood, and detailed animated sprites for enemies, as well as an amazing level design throughout the whole game that makes you feel as if you were actually within nazi premises, trying to escape. Basic and easy controls, a choice of only 4 weapons (sharing the same ammo) and a nice amount of secret walls and treasure on each level make this game very rewarding and loveable. id's typical sense of humour can be witnessed throughout the complete gameplay in inter-episode texts, the enemies' speech as they see you and as they die, as well as Wolfenstein's famous PacMan secret level, make this game unique and amazing.Although it is possible to download the game for free, you will be glad to have paid some money for it.Where would FPSs be nowadays if id Software had pursued a different path and never developed Wolfenstein 3D? Would have another company dared make an incursion into FPSs? Would the 2398 Call of Duties of today exist? Or Half-Life?Every FPS in the shelf today owes its existance to this game. And you will not regret having played it.Update: I have happily nominated this game for ""The Test of Time"" Award for the December Steam Awards :) It is still as good (or maybe even better) as the day it came out.

												If you're a true ""old skool PC gamer""... Wolfenstein 3D needs no introduction. Play as Wolfowitz breaking out of the heart of a Nazi run castle. Start out with nothing but a dagger and work your way up to handguns, machine guns, chain guns, and more... all to meet your final fate of facing ROBO-HITLER... yes, that's right.. hybrid hitler in a robotic chain gun suite. The sounds are classic MS-DoS and the graphics defined a era of ESRB ratings to warn players what they're about to dive into.It may not seem like much, but this game was completely over-the-top for its day.If you like DooM or the newer Wolfenstein series games... this is a collectors must-have.

												Wolfenstein 3D is one of the earliest 3D FPS games ever made. You play as BJ Blazkowicz who is trapped in a Nazi prison and must escape through maze like environments. Through some unexplained reason he starts off with a pistol, which is fine considering the story is barely existent. This Steam version features the extra 3 prequel mission packs that double the amount of episodes from the base game. The prequel episodes are Episode 4-6 but I suggest starting off at Episode 1 since the prequel missions are significantly harder. There are four difficultly settings overall. The first two feature much less enemies so you will not be worrying that much about health or ammo and as a result make it feel more like a puzzle game. The other 2 feature tougher enemies and much more enemies occasionally placed in rather  inconvenient areas. Both offer completely viable playstyles.The gameplay feels more tactical than just running and gunning. A single well placed bullet can take up to 80% of your health and you will not be able to dodge since the game takes a realistic approach as to how fast bullets go through the air. So even the lowest of grunts can kill you if he has a faster trigger finger than you. Luckily they suffer the storm trooper effect of being unlikely to hit anything more than a couple of feet away and even if they manage to the bullet damage is decreased the further away you are. Which leads you to playing very carefully, scouting the area instead of simply rushing through hallways like a supersoilder. There is a 99 ammo limit  which seems like a lot but all the weapons share the same ammunition which leads to more depth as you decide which of the 3 guns are best suited for each situation.The 3 weapons are as follows, a starting pistol which is very effective close range but puts you in risk of a fatal shot, a submachine gun which is pretty solid in medium range but uses up more ammo and a chaingun that annihilates enemies but burns through precious ammunition quickly. There is also a weak knife that you won't be using except in the most dire of situations.  You start off with 100% health and can be regenerated by multiple items including health packs, turkey legs, and dog food. It is a rather strange feeling when you are on the verge of death and are overjoyed to see dog food. Though the real joy comes when you push against a wall and it slides open to reveal much needed supplies and nazi treasure. While we are on the topic of ill gotten goods I should mention there is a scoring and live system. Killing enemies and finding treasure generate points and when you get enough you will receive an extra life that puts you at the beginning of the level with just a pistol when you die. Which I find to be rather odd considering there are manual saves but can be useful if you save at a very inopportune time. Onto graphics. They are very,very outdated, obviously considering the age of the game. But it does negatively effect the experience since all of the walls have the same basic textures which make rooms look basically the same which can be confusing. Added to that problem is the fact that the level design makes no sense. The rooms have no logical rhythm to them and are just randomly stringed together, along with a lack of a map it is needless to say not a game for those that constantly forget where they parked their car. The enemy models look pretty good ranging from German Shepards to Nazi Zombies. There are no ceiling or floor textures either which I didn't find to be much of a problem since most of the game is gray. There are occasional plants and objects thrown about to liven the place up but they may have gone a little overboard with the amount of swastikas and Hitler pictures around. All in all I'd say the 3D effect is awesome but not much else. The sound in this game is good for the most part. Guns sound powerful and add intensity to the gun fights. As for the enemies I have no idea how good the voice acting is since I do not speak German but they do sound rather comical. Though it is extremely helpful since each enemy have their own audio line when they are alerted to your presence which lets you easily identify the type of enemy and their numbers. The metal bunker doors also have a nice sounding effect when opened and closed letting you know that the enemy is on the look for you. Unfortunately the music is pretty bad and gets annoying after a short amount of time. Strangely enough they saved the only good tracks for Episode 3 and they were never seen again. Overall this game is very basic with nothing more to do than search the environment and shoot foes which I can see getting unbearably repetitive for some. You will also need a good sense of direction to get much enjoyment from this game. If you can get past that you will find a very fun game which has exhilarating boss fights,  plenty of secrets and tons of missions to play through. It also has cool secret levels including one where you fight the ghosts from Pacman. So buckle up, find a chaingun and show them Nazis that a guy named BJ is no laughing matter!

												This game defined the FPS (First Person Shooter) genre.It has very addicting gameplay, and is definitely worth it if you buy the ""Wolf Pack"".There is a bit of configuring you will have to do to make it playable on a modern computer/OS, but not much. All I really had to do is fix the resolution. I also recommend disabling the mouse, it plays best with just keys/buttons (unless you have a joystick).If you're looking for something that has much more to offer but with the same kind of gameplay, I highly recommend DOOM (""Doom Classic Complete"" on Steam).

												Great, classic shooter. W3D is an entertaining game from start to finish despite its age.I enjoy the level design and the way gameplay flows even more than most of today's shooters. This particular version of Wolfenstein isn't recommended because of the many compatibility flaws, but its still playable after some tweaking. Highly recommended.			",128,8,4,24,3,1,6

												Wolfenstein 3D is, arguably, the first first-person shooter, the first shooter in general, the first 3D game, and the first ""hardcore"" game. While DOOM is objectively a better game, it could not have existed without id Software first developing this humble little MS-DOS game. Plus, the final boss is mecha-Hitler, which is the most badass final boss concept ever created.			",123,66,2,13,9,2,10

												Wolfenstein 3D is the third entry in a series that goes back to the 80's with Castle Wolfenstein and its sequel Beyond Castle Wolfenstein. This installment from the longest running FPS series as of most recent Wolfenstein: The Old Blood from last year takes a new spin on the original titles by the late Silas Warner. The premise is the mostly the same, you're an Allied spy on top secret missions to thwart plans of the Third Reich in an alternative 1940s, often involving the infamous Castle Wolfenstein, a notorious Nazi prison. Wolf3D retells the tale and gives you a name and a face in the likeness of William 'B.J' Blazkowicz, the series' protagonist with many varied scenarios: escaping Castle Wolfenstein, the danger of chemical warfare, twisted Nazi experimentation on POWs to create an expendable army, and even the occult in later installments. Episode 3 of Wolf3D also famously has you assassinating Hitler himself, no doubt a spiritual link to Beyond Castle Wolfenstein which has the same plot. Only this isn't your daddy's Wolfenstein: the Fuhrer packs a few tricks up his sleeve in the since traditional Wolfenstein fashion: a touch of sci-fi in a mostly fantasy WWII setting. History buffs need not apply, for its dumb fun at its finest.Unlike Silas' games, stealth mechanics like moving bodies and disgusing yourself with a Nazi uniform were removed in favor of more action, the transition from a top-down perspective with some of the earliest attempts at visuals to a VGA graphical 3D space in the first person truly set the mark as the definitive first entry for the FPS genre. Especially since you're using a visible gun. Wolf3D's world consists of 3D tiles that make up level design with 2D objects scattered about to flesh things out. The latter's important because architecture is restricted to 90 degree angles making unique geometry limited, with only so much variety. Everything's on one plane leaving you only concerned with what's on the horizon. Interactivity comes in the form of doors and secret pushwalls grant access to hidden medical supplies, munitions and treasure. Oh, and shooting the hell out of any Nazi goon that gets in the way. The most complicated thing is literally acquiring a key or two to unlock sealed off areas, and locating an elevator to leave the floor. Not groundbreaking by today's standards but it paved the way for FPS to come as they rapidly evolved in only a few short years (think: Half-Life came out six years later!).Most common complaint about Wolf3D is the mapping itself, and lack of an automap. The restrictions in architecture and limited number of textures can lead to same-y looking places making it difficult to find your way around. But if you have a good sense of spatial awareness and can recognize landmarks and object placements (and the trail of dead bodies you'll inevitably leave behind when disappearing corpses wasn't cool yet) you won't have too hard of a time. Whether it's id's own levels or fan-made I never have much trouble getting about (the source port ECWolf adds support for an automap however). The 60 maps as well can be an overbearing count at times with 10 per episode: 8 regular, a boss level and a secret level. I find its best to go through one episode at a time as opposed to trying to marathon it as it allows you to appreciate each episode for what its worth.Visually the game is colorful and is notably more cartoony than Doom, but still fairly realistic in portrayal especially in regards to themes: dark prison sections, comfy living quarters, well lit dining rooms, old and precarious looking passageways covered in moss, and luxurious castle areas with rich and clean decor. The variety isn't huge but what's there gets the job done and the attention to detail with the resolution of the textures and sprites they were working with still look convincing to this day, more or less on par with Doom.Gameplay is standard FPS fare and the closest thing to Doom, but with an almost tactical level of survival. You only carry 99 rounds of ammunition and its universal for the three guns you use: a decent pistol that's very powerful at point blank, a reliable (sub)machine gun that's fair on ammo consumption, and the almighty chaingun, while obviously extremely effective is expensive to maintain. Fresh ammo pickups net 8 bullets and used ones dropped by enemies will only contain half that. Overzealous use of the chaingun can quickly deplete your supply, forcing you to fall back on your knife, which is only good against a single enemy. Your health never goes above the base value of 100 and there's no armor. Damage suffered from enemy attacks, which are predominantly hitscan, can seriously injure at close range as the average damage of a bullet in Wolf3D is much higher than it is in Doom. It's not uncommon to be dropped in two shots or being torn to shreds by a single volley of automatic fire. Rushing into unknown areas guns blazing rarely pays off unless your reaction time is high and you have the health and ammo to make it with no or very few mistakes. Divide and conquer and the use of cover is the way to go, unless you clearly have the advantage to be bold and reckless.Enemy cast is small but serve their purpose well. Dogs are the only melee enemy, super weak but often the first on scene due to their speed and can be a nuisance. Guards are dolts with poor reaction time and armed with a pistol but can be dangerous in numbers. SS tote machine guns, their vests keep them going longer, and a small group is very deadly without cover (or a chaingun with plenty of ammo). Officers are fleet of foot, almost as strong as SS, and while they only have a pistol their reaction time is high and they can be lethal if underestimated. Mutants are the rarest, featured in the second episode originally. Almost silent, they're more durable than humans and are even faster than the Officer in attack. And then there's bosses. One is featured at the end of each episode and corresponds to the episode theme. For example Hans Grosse guards the exit/entrance to Castle Wolfenstein and does so with a pair of chainguns. Most bosses aren't too hard to bring down, guaranteed you have enough ammo, but staying out in the open is near suicidal if you don't have enough health.Music is composed by id's then musician Bobby Prince, and while the tunes are strictly Adlib format they all manage to sound unique and moody. It may not be most people's cup of tea but I can't possibly imagine this game with the music off. The music for me is on par with Doom's soundtrack, with many memorable and excellently composed tracks.Likewise, for every good or decent game there's usually something wrong with it. Mainly technical oddities. The enemy can shoot through the door animation but so can you. Enemies also shoot through each other while magically being unharmed which is unrealistic and annoying. No dedicated side step keys and the one sound channel often has sounds cancelling out each other, unless you use a source port.I won't deny that Doom is the penultimate 2.5D FPS as far as overall design is concerned but Wolf3D is still a surprisingly fun and well designed shooter. All thanks to the talented minds of John Carmack for the engine, John Romero for the game design, Adrian Carmack for the artwork, Tom Hall for the vision, and Robert Prince for his audio. There's a wealth of user made content available to this day, ports, and total conversions taking entirely new spins on the game. If you enjoy classic shooters, or just want to see where it all began, it still comes as highly recommended even with its sometimes antiquated design. Who knows, you may find a new obsession, as all the user content available is sure to keep you busy well beyond id's own game.4.0/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Welcome to the grandfather of all first person shooters. Going down the maze like corridors, humping the walls for that sweet, sweet secret. Even after all of this time, this game is still very fun to play. Modern ports like SDL and ECWolf make the game run on newer computers wonderfully.Once you get tired of the vanilla game, immerse yourself in the still active modding community. Wolfensteins modding community isn't as big as Doom's, but it's still just as talented and just as committed to the game.If you don't mind the dated graphics, the hitscan weapons and the lack of stairs, then do yourself a favor and jump into this scifi/history inspired FPS!

												Wolfenstein 3D or Wolf3D (DOS start up icon name) as some might stubbornly call it is one of the world's first 3D FPS game that once revolutionarised the gaming genre and set off a new wave of videogames that can be traced back to this very game. Made by ID software back in 1992 it was to various game consoles and home computer systems. But as unique as it was it was also a very infamous game amongst parents. It was infamous for it's nazi symbolism, Violence against animals and in 1994 germany's court even banned and confiscated this game from stores in their nation for racism and nazi referances. Long story short fun for the whole family!But enough with old stuff and on to the practical parts. Wolftenstein 3D is a maze based classic FPS game where the player has to fight his way through levels to escape. The game exists of 6 episodes each with their own final boss to defeat. handy to know is that this game supports keyboard, mouse, and joystick, none of them are hard to use so you should have no real trouble getting used to them. the game also comes with several difficulty modes which each respectively affect damage, enemy accuracy, enemy speed, and damage taken whch makes this game suitable for most players. Another thing that will probably save your bacon many times is that this game has a save feature you can use.All the best!(s.i.e)			",173,41,1,15,22,2,18

												Dost thou wish to leave with such hasty abandon? Y/NFor me, definitely not. This game has dropped such a nostalgia bomb that it should be illegal. Everything from the DOS running system, the crude sound effects, the 2d props, the basic high contrast colors, and the rigorous tearing sound you get when using the open button are just exceptional. This game set the standard for how shooters were to be made following its release, simply because it was the first. Being that the designers had literally nothing to go off of; they did a hell of a job for both the year of its release (1992) and the technology available.A definite recommend for those that love nostalgia, the 90's, FPS's, or all of the above.

												Wolfenstein 3D is the game that first defined the 1st person shooter genre, a true classic. Although extremely basic compared to more recent games, Wolfenstein 3D still provides challenging gameplay, a variety of difficulties, secrets and peculiar Nazi bosses up to a vampire / robot Hitler, all drawn in fantastic golden age pixel art! Wandering around mapless mazes and pressing on walls looking  for secrets passages, all while killing pixelated nazis with limited vocabularies make this a great classic to playthrough.Pros:+ 6 Episodes, with 9 levels each provide plenty of gameplay+ Multiple diffculty settings for those wanting a real challenge+ Runs perfectly on Steam, as well as saving on the cloud+ Save the game anytime to start where you left off+ Awesome bosses like vampire / robot Hitler with death replaysCons:- You die in a few hits depending how close the enemy is- Mazes can be hard to navigate as there are no maps available- Enemies always lurking behind hidden corners can wipe you out with ease- Not a big variety of weapons (but that's understandable)Score: 7/10			",423,136,3,45,19,1,47

 A Brief History Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Apogee Software. Released on may 5, 1992, for the PC operating system DOS, many believe that this game started the FPS genre for games as we know and love today. Full Review Originally, Wolfenstein was released in parts. However, with the steam release for the game you will have full access to all levels and episodes for you to play through at your own pace. In the full game, there are about 6 episodes, and in each episode there are 9 levels. $5.49 is a good price for a retro game only 9MB in size and has about 54 levels in total.The protagonist's name is William ""B.J."" Blazkowicz. Blazkowicz is an American spy of Polish desent. The first three episodes of the game are based around B.J. and his efforts to stop the Nazi regime. In the first episode, B.J. over powers his prison guard and escapes the Nazi prison. In the 2nd episode, B.J. finds out that the Nazi army in creating undead soldiers and B.J. tries to stop the evil doctor behind their creation. At the end of the third episode, B.J. faces off against Adolf Hitler in his underground bunker, Hitler is waiting in a robotic suit equipped with four heavy chain guns, these three episodes put together make for an amazing gamplay experience, and challenge which should take about 1.5 hours to complete. (If you don't get lost).If you love the classic game, or just enjoy run-and-gun FPS shooters, then Wolfenstein 3D would be a good game for you, and I would wholeheartedly recommend this game.

												BEST ABOUT IT:  Exterminating Nazis in THREE DEE!WORST ABOUT IT:  The nauseating early 3-D graphics.  Getting flanked by a Nazi and not being able to turn fast enough or one that shoots you from behind a door before the door even opens enough to see them.  Or those planters that they deviously colored just like the Nazis.GAMEPLAY:  The great grand-daddy of FPS.  You navigate a series of mazes to find an elevator and any keys needed to open the doors that block it and are scored at the end of each based on your time, kills, and secrets found.  You're armed with a knife and the 3 guns you can pick up. (pistol, submachine gun, and Gatling-gun).  You can only carry 99 bullets so ammo is always a concern, especially since all your guns share the same rounds and the automatics burn them fast, but that's part of the game's core design.  Many secret passages contain guns and ammo but there's no hint to what walls open, so you just have to rub against them all.CONTROLS:  You can turn left and right and also strafe by holding shift but you cannot look or aim vertically.  It doesn’t seem too picky about your horizontal accuracy either, you just aim in a Nazi’s general direction and drop them (good thing too since there’s no iron sight or crosshairs).STORY:  Kill Nazis go!  You’re a captured spy and the game contains 6 episodes of 10 floors each.  Episode 1 has you tasked with escaping while the others have other objectives such as killing various madmen bosses, including Hitler.GRAPHICS:  They’re bad.  There’s not even a texture for the entire floor or ceiling.  It’s the flattest looking 3-D game you’ll ever see.  But 3 dimensions had to start somewhere and you’re looking at it here.  There’s no resolution or graphics options at all.PERFORMANCE:  This didn’t even tax computers 20 years ago.  It launches in DOSbox and ran perfectly for me.SOUND:  Better than the graphics and there are some memorable Nazi death cries.  The music is creepy yet fun at the same type, a military style and it works well.REPLAYABILITY:  Other than the curiosity or nostalgia factor there is a scoring system and secrets to find but it’s unlikely many people would be compelled to keep playing.  But any FPS fan or retro gamer should at least try this.SIMILAR TO:  Doom, Star Wars Dark Forces, Shadow WarriorRECOMMENDED PURCHASE PRICE:  <$5 (often included in Doom promotions)TITLE:  Wolfenstein 3DDEVELOPER:  id SoftwareRELEASED:  1992 (Steam page is incorrect)80/100			",491,112,10,109,59,5,124

												The second squeal Wolfenstein, and the game that defined the FPS genera. Despite the fact that this was the first FPS of it's kind (predated only by titles like MIDI Maze and Maze War), the weapons and combat are surprisingly satisfying. The big, big problem with Wolfenstein 3D is the horrible, maze like level design of identical looking corridors. Despite this, it's still fun to play, and an absolute essential titles for anyone interested in gaming history.Hitler Boss out of Ten			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ein einzelner Schlag muss den Feind zerstören. This is the one that started it all. The grandfather of 3D shooters, the one that established the fast-paced action and technical ability the genre is known for. It contains simply genius level design and mechanics. This is the first first person shooter that everyone should play in their lives, and it is mandatory within your library if you're a fan of games in general. 8.6/10.0 ",332,52,17,28,17,1,21

												Wolfenstein 3DGet psyched!Wolfenstein 3D, released in 1992, is ID software’s first major first person shooter. It is a reboot of the 1980’s “Castle Wolfenstein” series made by Muse Software and is arguably the very game that set the fps genre in motion to where it is today. You play as William ‘B.j.’ Blazkowicz, an American WWII spy, who was captured by the Nazis after successfully assassinating superior Nazi officers in charge of a chemical warfare project. Imprisoned in the lowest levels of the German base ‘Castle Wolfenstein’ you manage to kill the soldier guarding your cell, taking his knife and hand gun, and fight your way through legions of Nazi enemies to escape the castle. To quote the admirable John Carmack “Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It's expected to be there, but it's not that important.” This perfectly depicts Wolfenstein 3D. The closest you get to a story in this game is a short 1-2 page sample of text at the end of each episode, which summarises the episode you just completed and previews the next one. It is fair to say that the story isn’t this games strongest suit, but what it lacks in story, it makes up for in other aspects.The gameplay in Wolfenstein 3D is undoubtedly its strongest suit. Although today, in comparison to modern games, it may seem primitive and very dated, at the time of its release, fps shooters were still the topic of much amazement. Although it wasn’t ID’s first fps with other titles such as Catacomb 3D already on the market, The Nazi genre had not been done to the extent it has today, and so the WWII setting coupled with the, then considered, extreme violence resulted in an overwhelmingly positive response. There aren’t many weapons in this games, 4 in total, the only memorable one being the chain gun which is where the real satisfaction of shooting in this game lies. It fires bullets at a rapid rate churning threw countless rounds of ammunition per minute, with no reload mechanic making clearing rooms a very satisfying and bloody task once acquired. Although the range of different enemy types in Wolfenstein 3D isnt as large as other games released at the time, they undeniably fit the games setting and genre perfectly and don’t feel out of place. They range in difficulty from the German shepherds and ordinary Nazi troopers being the easiest, to the SS guards, Nazi officers and Mutant soldiers being more challenging encounters. However what Wolfenstein 3D is really remembered for is it fantastic Boss fights. The idea is that you traverse 9 floors in each episode, including one secret floor, and then on the last level fight a Boss. These are the most memorable and challenging moments in Wolfenstein, notably when you get to fight Adolf Hitler himself in a Mech suit wielding 4 chain guns. Unfortunately the majority of the gameplay in this game involves key hunting in order to progress to higher floors which can be a tedious task at times especially on later floors where the maps are extremely big and maze like. Also, due to the limits of the engine at the time, a lot of the environments look the same making it really easy to lose track of where you are, resulting in the painful task of walking around, hoping to stumble across a key or find a familiar looking area. However, the slaughter of Nazi enemies as well as pushing on secret panels throughout each level to find secret areas with tressures inside all make the gameplay enjoyable while you are performing the aforementioned key hunting and other irritating tasks. The soundtracks in Wolfenstein, composed by Bobby Prince, are quite remarkable. Even for a game made so early in video game history, ID was still able incorporate these magnificent soundtracks into the gameplay as well as some games that are made today. The Nazi anthem is played on start-up of the game to get the player in the mood for killing Nazis. Tracks like “Suspense”, “Enemy around the corner” and “Into the dungeons” let off a really creepy vibe which create a very eerie atmosphere when you are traveling down a long empty corridor and hear a door open or close in the distance. “Kill the S.O.B”, “P.O.W” and “Lurking…” are all really suspenseful soundtracks that actually make you feel like an American spy infiltrating a castle, even if there is little to no stealth in the game. Most memorable however is the “End of level” soundtrack which plays as your percentage of kills, secrets and treasures is calculated, making the player feel like they have accomplished something. At the time of Wolfenstein’s release PC’s couldn’t perform at the same level as Nintendo’s living room consoles could. It was John Carmack, lead ID game programmer, who changed this by designing an engine that brought the visual quality of NES games to the PC. Wolfenstein’s Graphics, although dated nowadays, was considered stunning at the time of its release and coupled with the fact that no other PC games on the market looked this good, made it much more appealing to buyers. Level design on the other hand has never been extremely impressive. Due to limits of the engine, there could only be one level/plane meaning no staircases or jump ability. The Maps have a very Maze like design and although may appear like a WWII castle at a glance, due to the brick and wooden wall textures as well as tables and chairs, the layout is very random and confusing resulting in, as mentioned early, the regular occurrence of losing your way.Overall this is a very solid game. The gameplay is enjoyable, and although a few minor irritations may be encountered along the way this is outweigh be the fun of slaughtering hundreds of Nazi enemies. The soundtracks are very unique, it is obvious a lot of effort was put into them unlike some modern fps’ today, which just include a generic action score that no one will remember. The level design and graphics have aged a lot and you would be better off playing with a map of the level beside you to avoid the annoyance of getting lost in the maze like levels. Anyone interested in video games, first person shooters in particular, might find this game interesting as it is one of the most revolutionary games in fps history, however if you have grown up or become accustomed to modern consoles and PC games I would say that you are in for a bit of a shock. 7/10 ",87,6,0,8,0,0,6

What I liked about the game 	The game can be additive; I've spent quite a lot of time on the game.  	Awesome boss fights. Some very creative bosses, especially the boss in episode 3. They can be quite challenging as well. 	Plenty of secrets to be found, although they can be quite tricky to find. There are also secrets levels, out of the six episodes I found four secret levels.	You get a lot for your money. 60 levels in total, 4 of those are secret levels. 	Awesome soundtrack, although it does get repetitive.           Smart A.I.    What I disliked or was disappointed with 	I don't like this idea that when you start an episode you get a number of lives, so when you get up level 9 and lose all of your lives, its game over, and you have to start the episode all over again. It's not just Wolfenstein, I have also seen this feature in Rise of the Triad and Catacomb; mainly old games, before 1995. You could just save it and forget about the lives feature, but it doesn't feel right; it feels like you are cheating. I'm glad this feature wasn't in Doom. 	There's a lot of blue in the levels, lots of pictures of Hitler and loads of swastika flags, it makes the game very repetitive.	There are only four weapons in the game. You will hardy use the knife and the three guns use the same ammo; there is no rocket launcher or shotgun. 	Episode six is very hard, especially towards the end; its like hide and seek, the Nazis hide you seek and when you find them, you either get killed or  half of your health is gone.	Sometimes you can get lost in the levels, because each level is like a maze, you got to find a key and then you got to find the exit. ConclusionA good game which can be addictive, but if you haven't played any 90's fps games before and you want to try one out, I would probably not recommend Wofenstein 3d, because of its maze like levels and it's repetitiveness. I would recommend you try out games like Doom or Duke Nukem 3d. If you are a big retro gaming fan like myself it is a must have for your collection.  70/100 ",106,1,0,3,1,0,0

												Take on the armies of Nazi Germany in the grandfather of first-person shooters. A 90's classic that basically started the genre. It's always satisfying to hear the cry of helpless fascists amidst your gunfire, chuckle at the bleeps and bloops of racking up treasure on your useless scoreboard, and eat dog food. The most irritable factor is that the player must navigate the same four colored (gray, red, blue, & brown) corridors every level without the aid of a map. So what? Accept a worthy challenge and enjoy! 10/10			",99,6,0,1,5,1,3

												Wolfenstein 3D is a game hailed by some as the grandfather of the First Person Shooter genre and ignored by others as simply a hiccup before Doom came out.While it certainly was Doom that made the Genre popular Wolf3D still needs to be acknowledged for being the first. Before this it was all side scrolling and looking through the eyes of the protagonist simply wasn't an idea anyone had had yet.The gameplay is extremely basic, even by the standards of the time. There is no looking up or down, everything takes place on the same level and you move in blocks, much like first person RPG's. The sound and graphics quality were decent enough for the day but would soon be shown up completely by the release of Doom.The difficulty of it still holds some challenge today, particularly if you pick up some of the free map packs available and the bosses at the end of each level is truly a sight to behold. Mecha-Hitler will forever bring forth fond memories for me.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												I played this back when I was just a foetus in the 1980's. It was my first FPS ! This port works great too. No issues with it yet and it brings back many fond memories of slaying hordes of nazi's and zombies and nassssty dogses. Which kind of stinks because I like dogs. Well, not when they are trying to eat me but in general. These dogs have been indoctrinated by nazi propaganda. They made them sit up all nacht and read them passages from Mein Kampf until their brains liquified and they grew to dislike anyone not wearing a nazi uniform or at least who was not at a member of the Republican party. Or a priest of Amun, which leads me to suspect they are descendants of Akhenaten's own guard dogs whom he notoriously mistreated so they never bought into that whole Aten heresy. Polytheism FTW !....sorry got off track there....This game will bring back a lot of memories for you and also show how far the genre has come since the release of Wolf3d and SOD. Also, go here :http://www.wolfenstein3d.co.uk/index.htmNothing to do with the Steam release but interesting still. Has a lot of hints and information.			",118,18,4,42,62,0,55

												Wolfenstein wolfenstein where do I start. Wolfenstein 3D is the most inporent game for the First Person Shooter genre. It is not the first FPS (Maze War In 1974) but it is the game that popularize the genre. It's the third game in the Wolfenstein series. The first game was called Castle Wolfenstein by Muse Software for the Apple II and a sequel ""Beyond Castle Wolfenstein"" In 1981 and 1984. Muse Software went bankrupt in 1987 and the Wolfenstein name was public domain. 5 years later Idsoftware brought the rights in 1992 and the game be came the game we know today!The gameplay is the same like doom but you can not circle strafe.The controls are arrow keys to go up and down left and right. ctrl is to shoot and space bar is the open door/use.I recommend useing Ecwolf to play W3D with higher risaloshins and support for mouse and keybourdI think this game can be hard at times and the gameplay and controls are outdated but the game is fun to me and one of my favourite games from IDsoftwareII wound also recoommend Doom and Quake for simlar gameplay			",48,0,0,2,3,0,0

 Caught by surprise behind the enemy lines, you've been captured by the Nazis and been sent to Castle Wolfenstein to be emprisoned (and possibly later questionned) deep under the castle. Little did they know you've manage to hide a loaded Luger with you... This Wolfenstein is a classic, this version in particular includes all 6 episodes (the initial 3 episodes aswell as prequel ''The Nocturnal Missions''). Fighting your way through multiple levels (10 per episodes) to prevent a chemical warfare to then ulimately take out Hitler himself. The gameplay is solid even to this day, the soundtrack is excellent & very catchy (but doesn't take itself seriously in some instances) and the level design is as simple as it gets but does perfectly the job. A quick note on the difficulty levels, for whoever looking for a bit of challenge, the hardest ''I am Death incarnate'' difficulty is  THE WAY  to play right away, I found myself having way more fun than on any lesser level of difficulty.Wolfenstein 3D is overall a well-rounded, challenging 3D shooter that defined a genre, worth playing and definitly recommended.

												Wolfenstein 3D (or ""Wolf3D"", as we referred to it by its name in DOS) was the first FPS game I ever played, and I have fond memories of it. Firing it up on our old 386 computer was amazing - suddenly this big, heavy beige box, which normally only displayed a very ancient, chunky version of Windows, was now playing a high-speed game with graphics and sound better than anything being done on the various game consoles we had plugged into the TV in the other room. And even though I was never really much good at Wolfenstein back then, its raw display of the PC's power and more importantly, the promise of what was to come for games, made me instantly fall in love with the idea of making computer graphics / games.This version of Wolf3D is better than the one we had on our old PC back then, in that it is the full version with all the episodes, instead of just the shareware copy with the single first episode.The graphics, while revolutionary at the time, are plain but still get the job done. The same can be said for the digital sound.If you've never played it, I suggest you give this game a try. If you're a fan of the FPS genre, it'll give you a good history lesson, and I suspect you'll find that this game is just as fun and engaging as most of the modern titles that have come to succeed it. You might even find yourself yelping and jumping out of your seat, as I recently did, when you zoom around a corner and an unexpected Nazi calls out and begins firing at you. Get psyched!

												Wolfenstein 3D is on of the few super classic oldschool shooter you need to play.This is a very good old shooter from the beginning of gaming era.Doom as Wolvenstein are made by the same person.These where even shareware in these days.If you like old games and did not grow up with this you really need to try this.It's a classic game you need to play and have if you are a gamer.Keep this game in your wishlist sometime you can purchase against a very small amount.I give it a 10/10 score because it's RETRO !!!!

												Its a classic. I even enjoy creeping around and looking for secrets. Everything about it i love. I would even go so far as to put it on the top ten classics list but thats just me. The game involves creeping around in a giant nazi castle and exterminating everyone and everything alive. There are many different enemies. The end boss is Adolf Hitler.

												ITS OVER.Years upon years I have been waiting to finally set some time aside to finish my first FPS i've ever played. Might I say it was quite a journey. It was pretty tough all the way up till the 9th floor on the 6th Episode. Then boy did it get out of hand... I felt like I WAS GONNA BLOW A BLOOD VESSEL. Enemy after enemy all of them back, left, right, and center expelling all of my ammo before I even got to see the final boss. If none of you have experienced this classic FPS do yourself a favor and scoop it up. You might think that this old game can't hang with a ""new age"" FPS player like yourself, but the controls, map layouts and enemy placement are very intentional and make for a very strong constant challenge. You can feel the amount of work that went into the map editing within the first few levels. You'll also learn that you can never relax & play this game for too long because by the time you find out you need to focus more its already too late and you rounded a blind corner with 5 S.S. soldiers and a few Officers that wipe the floor with you in an instant.So bottom line...-Don't bust on this game because you think its too old to provide a challenge. (because you'd be wrong).-Even if you've never played a game like this. The game still has nostalgic qualities.-The sprites are very well done even for low-res characters the art and the soundtrack are very nice.-The elaborate map layouts are close to challenging corn mazes for their difficulty.-The boss fights are so satisfying.Screw you all I am giving this game a 10/10. Because it actually is perfect and I didn't find a single thing wrong.""It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.""			",138,17,19,5,7,1,3

												So I picked this up on a whim, because I was bored and then Youtube happened, and... ahh, it's like I've been transported back well over a decade into the past.  Back to a time in gaming that I personally thought was pretty darn great.  Had been a few years since I last really played this, but it's amazing how it all comes back...I doubt I need to explain what Wolfenstein 3D is, really.  Pretty much everyone seems to have at least heard of it, and it's role in shaping the industry.  This game was a really, really major thing back then, and it paved the way for Doom, which was an even bigger thing.  But what does it play like?  Compared to modern FPS games, well... there's not much here.  This is an OLD game.  Really old.  I mean, this is back from an era where many people still had game sounds coming out of their PC speakers (do any PCs even HAVE those anymore?).  Back when things like Sound Blaster or America Online were big things. Back when all mice were ""ball mice"".  Kinda glad THOSE werent around.  Used to have to clean the stupid things by stabbing the internal bits with my car key.  Computers of that time could only do so much, and with a genre that had only just started.  And that does show here.Firstly:  The controls on this game. AWKWARD.  This is something I never really noticed back then, and that's because nobody had really come up with anything better yet.  I honestly dont even remember if the original version of this game had mouse support.  I really dont.  I remember that *I* used just the keyboard.  That's right. JUST the keyboard.  That's how old this is.  And it shows, because there's some very weird things going on with these controls.  Firstly, while you can remap controls, they still wont work quite like you want.  You have a key that you hold to run of course, but you ALSO have a key that needs to be held in order to strafe at all.  While you are strafing, you cannot TURN, because you're using the turn keys to strafe.  This can make things really, really awkward as you move around.  Fortunately there's a way around this:  Look for something called ECWolf, using Google.  It's not a free copy of the game or anything, you greedy snot.  It's something that uses an already existing copy of the game, and adds some ""quality of life"" features to make it better.  Most important, it lets you fix the controls to be non-awkward.  It also allows you to use a minimap.  That's right, this game didnt have one.  And I know, there's those out there that'd say it ""ruins the challenge"" to use one.  I say:  No.  Wandering around in areas you've already beaten, over and over and over again, while wallowing in extreme tedium is not ""challenge"".   Seriously.  Get the minimap.  It'll make your whole experience better, and it WONT ruin the challenge. And the game definitely has alot of challenge to offer you.   There are not all that many enemy types in the game (particularly in the first episode, as that episode also made up the demo version of the game, so only 3 enemy types appear in there), this is true.  But they all tend to hit like freight trains.  Even the absolute most basic soldier can chop off over 50% of your HP if he gets a hit on you up close. And that's with a pistol!  The closer the enemy is, the higher the damage they'll do to you.  And of course, the more accurate they'll be.  And these enemies arent flinging fireballs and actual ""projectiles"" at you like in Doom.  These enemies are all using proper guns, which means hitscan attacks.  So once they fire, if their aim is true, you WILL get hit, as you'd expect.  So unlike Doom, just running through like a maniac is likely to get you flattened.  The game does a very good job of creating a challenge though without making it feel TOO hard.  And you have four difficulty settings to choose from.One defining feature of this game though is the levels.  These places are true labyrinths in every sense of the word.  Doom's levels were never this confusing.  Loops and dead-ends EVERYWHERE.  And secrets?  Oh yes.  There are secrets.  Despite that ALL secret doors work the same way... they look like a normal wall, but when you hit ""use"" on them they move backwards about 3 tiles or so... they can be amazingly hard to find.  There tends to be alot of them, and the game absolutely will do things like have one secret room that you find, which then has another secret room in it, which then has a third, which leads to a small maze with doors and rooms and things, one of which has another secret room, which has another secret room, and then your head bursts all over the ceiling.  It does stuff like this alot.While that can be pretty interesting, one thing of note is the game's items.  This isnt Doom where there's all these different powerups and armor and lots of weapons.   There are FOUR weapons... two of which you start with...  and no powerups, no armor.  There are healing items, 1-ups (rare), and treasure.  Treasure increases your score... yes, this game has a scoring system... and counts towards the tally at the end of the stage.  MANY secrets will lead just to treasure.  This game was designed back in a time when scoring systems in games were still a major thing, and when players would go out of their way to get the 10000 points that an extra area might offer.  Because they want the damn points, that's why.   That sort of thing is starting to become more popular again recently, but some players wont really have played any games like that.  And if you dont like things like that, you're likely to find alot of secrets and bonus areas to be, well, not at all satisfying.  But if you're like me, always trying to get scores as high as can be, you'll find alot to search for here.Though I've always wondered just WHERE good ol BJ stashes the hundreds of crowns and treasure chests that he picks up along the way.And all of those things pretty much sum up the actual gameplay mechanics nicely.  Everything meshes well together, but be warned that the game can be repetitive.  LOTS of games are like that of course, but for some this one may be a bit too much in that way.  If that's an issue for you, this is not the game for you.  Also, if you need a big story, and talky bits to make a game interesting for you.... this REALLY isnt the game for you.  The story can be summed up like ""You're in this castle, built by maniacs.  Run through mazes and shoot evil Nazi jerks.  Find Hitler, who has a mech suit for some reason, and kill him.  Also kill some other bosses, because bosses. Thus the world is saved. The end!""  And that's all there is to the story.  You never even get to find out where he got that mech suit.  What a cliffhanger.With 60 levels, this is a LONG game.  There are 6 ""episodes"", with each episode having 9 normal levels, a boss fight, and one secret level (one of which is very unique... you'll know it if you find it).  If you can handle the simplicity and repetition, if you like finding treasure and doing battle against endless waves of evil enemies, finding secrets, exploring... Wolfenstein 3D is a true classic, and should be played through at least once.Just... get that ECWolf program.  It'll automatically notice your Steam installation of the game, and work with it.  You can thank me later.  Or thank me right now, that works too.			",271,38,1,35,44,0,30

												The big one.This is the game that brought id into the lime light. Before Doom, Wolfenstein 3-D captivated players with impressive 3D enviroments for the time.A lot of people say it hasn't aged well, but I think it has. It's a pretty fun game, but it can get boring. It's basically just the gameplay of Doom except you have lives and shoot Nazis and collect treasure. The levels are all flat planed dungeon/castle theme levels due to the limitations of the engine. There are no elevated surfaces and ceilings and floors have no texture. Still though, that doesn't mean it's bad. It may tire you after a while of play though.All you have to do is get to the end of each level, but you really have to mind the nazis around you or you could be killed in literally one shot.For it's time, Wolf 3D was groundbreaking. By today's standards, it can get boring at times, but it's still as fun as I remember playing it. If you don't want to shell the 4.99 for wolf 3d, you can download the Wolfenstein 3D Total Conversion for Doom 2.			",212,20,2,5,4,2,5

												I remember playing this gem at 6 years of age on my dads lap. He had a windows 95 machine that he ran his computer repair business off of. The smell of our basement always reminds me of that moment. He would mash MLI for God mode as I would shoot the bosses at the end of each episode. I even caught my mom playing it one afternoon. I looked all over the house and outside for her, could not find her anywhere until i checked my dads office. Killing nazis has since become a family tradition, and i fired this up the other day and it still makes me smile. Get this game if you want to go back to where it all began.			",58,4,2,7,7,0,12

												It reminds me of the one I played decades ago. I know this goes against keeping it like it was years ago, but really wish there was true controller support. None of the Wolfenstein games have full controller support. And this version, 3D, offers none (though you'll notice it actually supports some actions). I admit I'm not one of those avid gamers that true to using the keyboard. But I like the controller and doing keyboard is the only thing stopping me from playing the game more.However, this does feel like the old game, keyboard controls and all. And is still a blast and brings back great memories. I would still recommend it.			",73,24,8,5,4,0,1

It defined the run-and-gun genre that lasted for many years.I completed it countless times in the 90's on my humble PC (along with 200+ other DOS games), and never tired from it.And seriously, who wouldn't want to face a pixelated mecha-Hitler as the final boss?Not this guy. 7/10.

												I originally played the shareware first episode of this game years ago and have only just played through the full game in the last week or so. I am not sure that I would have bought it, as part of the Wolf Pack bundle, had it not been on special offer but I am glad that I did. Bottom line is that it is fast, fun, easy to learn and has something about it that sets it apart from the other pre-Doom first-person shooters  most of which have been - unfairly in some cases - forgotten. Visually, the game has not dated well. Many of the levels suffer being, in whole or part, repetitive mazes. Coming back to  it after so many years makes you remember quite what a huge step foreward Doom was when it first came out: sometimes I forget that I can't shoot and explode the barrels in Wolf3D. As classic and influential game Wolfenstein is as much an historical curiousity as playable game but it is a hugely playable game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Think about how many weeping, terrified WE WERE ONLY FOLLOWING ORDERS digital German families you've deprived of their fathers and sons. Think about the political reality of the virtual genocide you've carried out.

												This new virtually unknown game, brings realism and excitement to the computer screen. Control your character with not one but several buttons at once!!! Shoot those enemy's down in a fashion that you prefer as this game is designed for the user to bring out the killing machine in you. Watch out for the secret boss at the end (You will never guess who it is so stop trying)			",193,24,6,16,8,0,10

												This is one of those rare games that's aged remarkably well thanks to tight controls, replayable levels with secrets and treasure, and a difficulty level that's fair but also makes it possible for you to be gunned down in 2 seconds if you can't react quickly enough to a mini-gun.Plus, you get to kill Mecha-Hitler.

												Much like DOOM and Heretic/Hexen, Wolfenstein 3D is a classic shooter of the dos era. Everyone knows the story about how this is the grandfather of modern shooters and maybe that's why you're here, maybe you want to give this game a try. If you do you need to note this is the dos version of the game, many people hate that and for good reason too, dosbox (an emulation of dos) doesn't run well on modern machines unless you know how to alter the config files for games that run on it. Luckily, though, there are source ports for these games that allows them to run smoothly at 60fps and at higher resolutions. The source ports I use do allow you to play the games ""vanilla"" aside from the higher frame rate, which can be changed if you want the most vanilla experience possible while still being able to enjoy these games. I do recommend this game, but please if you get it get ecwolf.			",103,4,1,14,2,0,5

												This is an old school game with old school controls (think it has option for current controls but not 100% sure). It's got no high tech graphics or anything but it is super fun. You escape from your cell and you run around this maze of rooms and levels trying to escape all the while you search for ammo, food, hidden rooms with treasure and better guns. And if you look really hard you might come across a secr--...well I will let you figure that one out. I will recommend this game to anyone who likes simple older styled games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're hankering for a bit of nostalgia, this is probably $5 well spent.That said, this has a couple of issues, and these should be mentioned alongside the fact that I run Windows 8.1 64 bit.  There are options for mouse functionality that don't seem to work, leaving you to navigate and fight with keyboard only as you did back when this game was released.  Granted, that's the way it's meant to be played, but after a decade of a more polished experience it feels a bit clunky.  Also, there appear to be a few other hardware incompatibilites that detract from the experience.  The sound playback seems to be incompatible with modern cards, leading to weird sound glitches (go to

 to hear what it should sound like minus the modern voice over and gun SFX, then play and decide for yourself.)  Not sure if this is something wrong with my settings or a legitimate incompatibility with either my sound card or playback devices.This is also a straight port, not revamped in any way.To be honest, I had more fun playing the iPhone port which is free.  However, this version gets an 8/10 overall from me for pure nostalgia value and the fact that it was (and is) an amazing game and pioneer of the FPS genre.EDIT: Not sure if they've patched this since my original review, or if the upgrade to Windows 10 is the cause, but the sound issues are much less noticeable.

												Many years of my youth were spent in these prison walls. This is the real deal, original and amazing. John Carmack is one of my biggest inspirations, and this, in my opinion, is one of his masterpieces. id Software pushed the limits of what PCs could do at the time and achieved the impossible.The settings they chose for DOSBox don't appeal to me however. I am not keen on using filtered graphics. I like crisp pixels. If you would like to see what I mean there, is an easy way to set the graphics very crisp and original feeling, and while we are at it, we can also smooth out animation a lot:1. Right-Click the game in Steam, and choose ""Properties"".2. Click on the ""Local Files"" tab.3. Click ""Browse Local Files"".4. Double click the ""base"" directory.5. Open ""wolf3d.conf"" with notepad.6. Look for the ""[sdl]"" section.7. Change ""output=ddraw"" to ""output=overlay"".8. Scroll down to ""[cpu]"" section.9. Change ""cycles=auto"" to ""cycles=12000"".Save and exit notepad.Run the game and enjoy.This smooths out animation greatly, and provides original crisp feeling graphics. Some people prefer the filtered look, if that's you, just leave it as ddraw and only change the ""cycles"" option.			",168,48,2,9,13,0,12

												This interactive fiction adaption of the historical epic ""Until the End of Time"" is, for the most part, very faithful to the source material. Details that are unfortunately absent include Adolf Hitler never going Super Saiyan during the climatic final battle, among other inaccuracies.Still, this is well worth 4 of your hard-earned dollars, and 99 of your spare pennies. There are 60 levels in this game. That equates to 8.316666666666667 cents per level, which is a very good deal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As said may times before, Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny helped pioneer the shooter genre. This game is awesome, there is nothing bad that can really be said about it, it still kicks serious♥♥♥♥♥today.Steam version review: Well since I have only played this version, the steam version, i can't really compare that much. However, there is obviously benefits to this version! First of all, it loads up and installs pretty fast! Secondly, there is no floppy disk you have to deal with, finally, the game runs extreamly smoothly. Although, there is one complaint I have, I can't make it go back to fullscreen after existing for a moment! Besides that, this game is awesome and I would reccommend buying it on steam!Overall Game: I wasn't born for this game to come out, i was born well after it came out, but I have enjoyed it thoroughly! Even if my generation finds games like this extreamly hard (I agree with them, sometimes), this game is awesome, it is just so fun! I can see how this game and others like it made gamer's crave first-person shooters, they are even better than today's call of duty and halo franchises, in my person opinon. It takes a minute to get use to the controlls (If you are a console gamer), but it is suprisingly easy after a s hort time! I love this game, I only wish it was longer! What I would pay: Wait until the wolf pack drops, you can get three games for the price of one, maybe even less. I got the wolf pack at 75% off, you don't have to wait for that, but I would reccommend the wolf pack at 15.00 unless you can't take the waiting any longer. It's a fun game, but dissapointingly short!			",178,11,0,24,17,0,17

												Wolfenstein 3D is the granddaddy of the first person shooters. It was developed by ID software and released in 1992. The game is still amazing and very enjoyable, just keep in mind that the game is almost 25 years old (It was released in the 5th of May). The objective of each level is to get to the exit. Sometimes keys are required to progres. In the 9th level of every episode you are required to kill the boss of the episode to continue. The controls are really antiquated, but using the ECWolf source port allows for a mouse and keyboard control scheme. The levels are made out of corridors and all the angles are 90 degrees (due to the engine's limitations). This can create a lot of confusion as the levels feel like a maze (and in episode 6's case, they are literal mazes). The ECWold source port fixes that issue by adding a automap. Wolfenstein 3D is my favourite pre-Quake game. I higly recommend it.			",383,62,12,32,26,3,50

												When compared to contemporary FPS games the graphics are eye-searing and the level design head-ache inducing monotony.  The damage system is suprisingly sophisticated for its time though.  All that said though this game is still the OG of not just modern FPS's but modern computer gaming as a whole.  Because of this the game has a very noticable charm all its own and is still quite fun to play.  Cheap and frequently on sale this game is worth getting and playing for those who have a appreciation of gaming history.  Also, it's the original game where you get to personally kill Hitler and his cronies.  Hard to beat that.			",153,67,0,10,4,2,7

												Wolfenstein 3D was the game that brought the FPS Genre on he map. At least until Doom came out then everyone forgot about it. You play as William B.J. Blazkowics, an imprisoned U.S soldier at the notorious Nazi occupied Castle Wolfenstein. You kill one the guards, take his gun, and now your off to excape Castle Wolfenstein. Gameplay was simple, you loot ammo from dead Nazis, discover secrets, and capture Nazi gold while you're shooting yourself through each floor of the castle. Overall, the game is pretty good. The only gripes I have with it is how repetitive it can get. You shoot Nazis, take gold, find secrets, then rinse and repeat until you eventualy get to the final boss on floor 10. Then do it all over again for 5 episodes. The second thing I dislike about it is how easy it is to get lost at times. All the rooms have the same textures on the walls, so it can get pretty confusing on figureing out the direction you didn't go in already. Wolfenstein 3D is a fun peice of ""Gaming History"" that any gamer needs to try at least once with the proper mods installed. I give it a 78/100.  So GET PSYCHED and buy the game already!

												Wolfenstein 3D is pure old school shooter fun. While the game features a few tricky levels, for the most part it is smartly designed to deliver maximum Nazi killing fun. It might be old, but this game's still got some bite to it.As one of the shooters that helped put id Software on the map, it is a piece of gaming history. And hey, it's one of the few World War 2 FPSes where you actually get to fight Adolf Hitler himself!No checkpoints, no autosaves. Just lots of bullets and Nazis to blow away. While some of the later levels can lead to some hair pulling by hiding important keys and items behind hidden walls and also becoming more maze like, the designs for the most part work well at letting you find your way without getting lost.

												I find that the right way to play this game is to play how it was intended. Get into a hard enough difficulty level, and play it without abusing the save function. You have a finite number of lives. That's how many attempts you get at an episode.As far as I know, it's the only FPS that attempts that. It can be quite an unforgiving game. If you fail to see the random guard behind a door before you get into a room, one or two shots at close range can end your life and force you to restard with a simple gun.Wolf3D is still a very, very, great game. It's beautiful in simplicity, is still challenging, and a must play.			",251,114,4,84,24,2,42

Probab~*some guy on the back* STFU, it's my job...Actually yes, Wolfenstein 3D is the best of id Software made in 90s called a ""grandpa"" of 3D games, and no doubt this game is a successful beginning of most games that also became a love to us!Schoolchildren today will not understand why is it so popular and why everyone loves this game. There is no need for a description but we can answer with few words:3D ShooterWW2Lots of secrets in each levelJohn Carmack!Cons? How you dare?! You can't see the cons in this game!!!

I had to completely relearn the game its been so long. never the less, great classic game that i caught on sale and couldnt pass up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game in my opinion that hasn't aged well.  for once It's entirely a maze game which I do not like since maze levels are complex in a bad way imo. everything else is fine controls are pretty good despite being tank controls. your weapons you have feel like power ups rather than weapons but i can forgive that since this is one of the first of it's kind enemies are kinda fun to fight. as a piece of history I appriciate how it's one of the first to start my favorite genre that I can not deny but it's maze levels kinda kill it for me. 6.5/10 a decent game			",340,5,1,7,5,2,4

												My mother didn't want me playing this game when I was a child, but now I love this game! It is a epic game that puts you against the German army and makes you want to kill them. This a old game that can never get old. The creative levels really make you feel like you can get lost but for the most part the levels are simple. The gameplay is smooth. Just remember the code ILM, push those at the same time to get all weapons and ammo.  Its a great old fashion game that really brings me back for more!  ",3034,1132,139,314,429,33,476

												A Classic! If you want simple old schol FPS this is it. It can be pretty hard being almost all the enemies have guns. Also without any map and similair looking walls prepared to get lost a lot. This one is game everyone should try but if your looking to spend some time playing a classic you must play DOOM!

												The granddaddy of FPS almost in its full glory..... The port is not good at all - it uses an old version of the DosBox and you will need to manually configure the setting for the Dosbox in order for the game to run smoothly (if you dont do it then the game will be blurry and suffer from low framerate).I recommend to download ECWolf which will do all of the above and more for you in order to play on the newer systemsECWolf also adds new features like: automap, controller support, the ability to sidestep or you can go vanille and play the game old-school ",667,205,21,132,72,9,131

												During 1992, ""3D"" PC games were nothing new, but what Wolfenstein did was add a bit more flair to a ""3D game"". Most ""3D"" games at the time were admittedly quite slow and boring, without much sound or music. Wolfenstein 3D on the other hand added a fast paced element to the gameplay and music at the expense of the framerate. For 1992, where 3D gaming was scarely heard of, Wolfenstein 3D is probably one of the youngest FPS candles to be held towards modern gaming. I'd give it about a 6/10, it hasn't aged well but the gameplay is still there.			",18,0,0,0,1,0,1

												For a person who was introduced to this game because of doom (ironically) I loved the game and I took a gamble getting it but it all pays off. It’s awesome for the world’s first first person shooter (try saying that three times fast!) that was made in 1998 (I think it was that year last time I checked :P) it had awesome gameplay. I still like the soundtrack on the first level on the first stage! :D So if you like a throwback shooter that you will have lots of memory’s playing just play Wolfenstein 3D			",66,1,0,4,1,1,0

												The first ever first person shooter that id software ever released. A game that takes place in World War 2 but the enemy which are the Nazis have advanced technology and advanced military equipment. I would recommend this game to anyone that is into World War 2 or anyone that are into 90's video games.			",61,1,0,0,1,0,1

												Probably one of the greatest shooters ever devised. No story to worry about, just gameplay. Just 10 floors stand between you and the boss, with 5 sets of floors between you and the ultimate boss... Mecha Hitler! If you thought call of duty was realistic and modern, you haven't seen anything quite like the awe inspiring Wolfenstein 3D!			",489,100,5,72,31,4,76

												I begin by trying to use a knife on a guard. I am reminded that the knife is as useful as ripped condom. Then I shoot someone with a pistol. I am reminded that small caliber rounds are like cannonballs. I find my minigun only to discover that it uses the same ammo as my empty pistol. I finnd ammo in a secret wall that is magically powered by the space bar. I discover that even though they have the same ammo pool the minigun makes far bigger blood pools. I use my minigun now called sahsa to slaughter nazis. I am then shot by captain valen von ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. After blowing open holes in his stomach, I am healed by the all wonderful turkey dinner. Thank you based turkey dinner. At the end of the day when I am doe shooting nazis I make a bed out of a mound of corpses and fall into a deep sleep. Then I make up and discover I am in an institute for the mentally insane and suffer from PTSD and this never happened.			",104,11,0,9,5,2,6

The graphics of course to not compare to what we have these days but it is the challenge that makes the gameplay worthwhile.The controls are simple but satisfying and the level design is flawless.If you enjoy modern first-person-shooters then you owe it to yourself to experience how it all began in the form of this masterpiece.

												Wolfenstein is an extremely arcade-y shooter, to the point of having a life counter. The backgrounds are so plain and boring, it's easy to imagine why Doom blew everyone away back in the day. The graphics themselves are doom-style ugly. All that said, Wolfenstein is a piece of gaming history, and any serious shooter fan should at least consider adding this game to his/her collection.Here's some gameplay:

												Played only a little bit of this game and didn't really enjoy it. I know it's an old game, so the gameplay should be the only important factor in this review. However, I can't even say I thought that was enjoyable as well. My mouse turned super sensitive while playing and I couldn't figure out a better way to play other than to use the clunky arrow keys. The level design was alright, but repetitive at times. In my opinion, Doom Classic is better. It came out later so id's development process had improved, but I digress.Anyway, would not recommend because there is a browser release that has been out for 2 years as of this review. Must have been released for promotion of the The New Order. So, no point in paying ANY money for this at all.2/5 Would Not Reccommend			",14,6,0,1,1,0,1

												The concept of this game can really looks simple these days : killing nazis with weapons and ammunitions that we find in the labyrinthic levels that looks like a sort of Nazi base full of swastikas and of portraits of the Führer and by eating leftovers of food ( normally destined to dogs ) to regenerate your life, and also to pick items that give you some points.In reality, in this era, we loved to shoot everything, the fact that we could kill some nazis was revolutionnary and amazingly epic, some could get bored because of the graphics ( that's a game of 1992 after all ), but i think that it is partly what makes the charm of the game.To be honest, i have more fun in this game than in COD or BF.Try it, it's cool.

												It was revolutionary for it's time. The problem i have with it is the fact that you spend the entire game killing germans - killing white people.Hitler wanted to save the white race in the long run, but sadly anglos, gypsies, juden and others didnt wnt this happening and thus the largest mass-death in the world's entire history had to occur as slavs and anglos♥♥♥♥♥♥♥german women and even killed unarmed german males. Even childreni find this game highly offensive for featuring countless mass murder against your own race.It's also a highly inaccurate portrayal of nazis. a lot of nazis were centrist and moderate and even fun, playful and spiritual, friendly outstanding role models#notallnazis			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though wolf 3d is a great classic game, this port is terrible. It has NO controller support, and barely runs on windows 8.1. I purchased it thinking it would be similar to the xbla version, but its just the original running on a very old version of dosbox. I really wish this would get updated and made playable again. I would change my rating immediatly. In the mean time, save your money.I ended updownloading ecwolf and using it to load this game instead of dosbox. Ecwolf adds native controller support, and runs flawlessly - I enjoyed playing through this entire game again. So if you bought this, and it doesn't work, ecwolf can help get you going. It also works with the other Wolfenstien Games as well.			",119,35,1,10,4,2,15

YouTube™ Video: LGR - Wolfenstein 3D - DOS PC Game Review 

			Views: 241,280		

			A new order of Wolfenstein games is out? Sounds like a prime time to catch up on the history of the franchise! Covers Wolf3D's predecessors, ports, Spear of Destiny, and more.		

An old favorite from my Childhood from the Old Order in 1992; Wolfenstein 3D from Apogee Software!Back in the day, it was Released as Shareware on Floppy Disk with 10 Levels of the First Episode & you would have to pay $50 for the Whole Thing. This was Apogee's First 3D Game before Rise of the Triad in 1995.You are Captain William ""B.J."" Blazkowicz of the Allied Forces in World War 2 while its at its Peak and got captured by the enemy & your mission is to escape Castle Wolfenstein in Episode 1. If you're new, DO NOT ATTEMPT to play on Normal (since I took Half Damge on the PS3 Version.)			",577,210,24,80,57,11,94

Wolfenstein 3D			* 8/10The first FPS by historical iD Software. During WWII as the imprisoned spy B. J. Blazkowitz you have to escape from your cell in Castle Wolfenstein by taking down all the nazis you'll encounter. That's basically the plot from the first episode of six. What can I say. It's a damn old game, running on dosbox, so a little knowledge of old systems and dosbox might help to tune it a little to prevent annoying little details, but at least it's working fine.I still DO NOT recommend to buy the game. Why? Because there's a free online version in the official wolfenstein site where you can play the first three episodes directly through your browser... And if you look deeper in a search engine you can find another site with all 6 episodes AND the spear of destiny expansion. It looks even more polished and plays smooth as silk, So why buying? -.-+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. There's not much to say, as one of the first FPS it's quite simple to understand how it works. There are still hidden walls, secret levels and of course nazi soldiers with impossible coloured suits... XD MUSIC.  Music is still midi, at the time it was the only alternative, but it really has an impact. Nazi or other anthems used here and there really give atmosphere, other tracks simply set the mood, other ones give adrenaline, others give suspence. One of the first works from Bobby Prince, a great work if I might say, but maybe it's just me and my nostalgia... :)---CONs--- DOSBOX. It's true, it's the only way to play it on modern PCs, but still it's hard to play smooth with default settings. You have to know it a little to tweak the emulator performance to bring it to a good state of playability (CTRL+F11 or F12 to increase/decrease the CPU Cycle) FREE. This game is almost 25 years old and still isn't in abandonware state but, even if it can't be considered quite ""legit"", you can play it online in your web browser for free. really. Even the original 6 episodes. So why buying? ",495,126,12,20,23,4,28

												The great-grandad of the FPS genre. Yeah, it's alright. I didn't like it too much.I know, I'm a horrid person, aren't I? So far, I've only played a couple of id games, and unfortunately this is the first one I didn't really enjoy. DOOM was like a blast of cocaine, and Return to Castle Wolfenstein was like a slightly less better version than Half-Life that I still appreciated. But this? Well... it's just kind of nothing.In Wolfenstein 3D, you follow a similar pattern of old-school gaming platforms that loosely tie a story together as you go and kill more and more enemies (which in this game's case is Nazis). So, most of the issues I have instantly fall towards gameplay. I will say this though, this game has NOT aged well, especially for its controls. I spent a while reconfiguring them for mouse input, but at that point, I could move around by moving the mouse. And the A and D made you look- not strafe- right and left, which was really irritating at certain points. The levels are pretty simple- find the key, kill the Nazis- but their structure definitely isn't. These maze-like dungeous kept me stuck for nearly 20 minutes, just trying to find my way out of one corridor, because all the hallways in this game look the same. Yes, there are deviations of color, but in those specific areas, everything looks the same! It's incredibly easy to start losing your head as you run in constant circles around the same places again and again and again...DOOM aged much easier, since it allowed actually understandable controls and gameplay that anyone could adapt to, with some relatively posh level design. Does that make Wolfenstein 3D a good foundation? Certainly. But does that make it a good game? Frankly no.			",184,74,0,14,4,0,2

												Wolfenstein 3D is single-player First Person Shooter that was released on PC MS-DOS in 1992. It's somewhat official sequel to Wolfenstein game for older computer, a top-down stealth game, yet W3D is neither of those. It wasn't the first FPS ever, no. Few were made before this one. It wasn't the most advanced engine-wise either, it was beaten easily by Ultima Underworld. What matter though, is that it was the first FPS that made the genre popular, as it was all about fast-paced action, running quickly and shooting everyting, exploring mazes, and not requiring a top-computer to be able to run.It would then later recieve more love, get expansion pack and be ported onto consoles and other computers, with some version being inferior and Mac family ports were almost superior to DOS. Superior ports got higher resolution graphics and two additional weapons, with levels remixed. DOS only got 8-sided sprites of enemies, while other ports have 1-sided only, which doesn't matter so much in this game. Oh, and differences in soundtracks and levels too.Now, with it being quite an old game, how Steam version was handled?The game itself is almost same as original DOS version and comes with all 6 episodes. The slight difference is a change of ""Apogee"" to ""Activision"", game being brought to Steam at around 2007 year. And they removed help/instructions completely for whatever reason. Probably because ordering info was beyond outdated. Thus no intro story for you.id software screwed up on DosBox part. It lags heavily. But you can fix it, you just have to go to game's folder and edit DosBox config file for Wolf3D, to make it run with OpenGL renderer.Shame that gameplay didn't age well, but it is most eye-pleasing WW2 shooter around from colorful design side, with memorable music being upbeat or funky suspense.The original release of the game had 3 episodes only, each having 8 normal floors, 1 boss floor and 1 secret floor:Escape From Castle Wolfenstein - Classic episode, which came fully with Shareware. Which was like, 1/3 or 1/6 of a game. One heck of demo.Operation: Eisenfaust - In this episode you explore some nasty dungeons only to find a secret entrance to nazy base. This is the only episode which has Mutant enemies, who are just plain nasties, providing a huge difficulty spike, for they are completely silent and can have zero reaction time. Good heavens they weren't used in other levels.Die, Furher, Die - Back to good joy again, this one introduces white officer nazis, who's only advantage is their speed. Still more fun than mutants. And in these set of levels you get to kill Hitler. Even ""few"". So it's awesome. And secret level is Pac-Man parody.Now, after original release, publishers figured out that id can quickly make additional 3 episodes themed after chemical war, Noctural Missions, and sell them as well. The results are 3 additional episodes that are quite meh and don't provide any new content, aside from bosses and textures:Dark Secret - Not much to be said there, it feel like direct continuation of episode 3, having harder and more complex mazes. Though I doubt that you would more of them.Trail of the Madman - This is where you see id starting to tire out and their creativity starting to sink. It provides simpler mazes than Dark Secret and you can see graphical themes of rooms starting to get even less interesting.Confortation - This is where developers got completely tired and are going to make players tired as well. Design of levels became completely lazy. First floor has you travelling corridors that have sideways every step and you have to check every one so you will not get bulet into back. Later level layout is nothing but nazi cross repeated few times and connected with each other by doors. Final boss is quite generic and is no match for Hitler encounter.After choosing your episode, you have to select your difficulty out of four, all of which have phrases as name, so you wouldn't be able to guess which one is ""Normal"". I recommend you to pick the second to top, as it will still get difficult at the end and you will not die as much. Due to realistical/hitscan nature of enemy attacks, you often will feel that you died in a cheap way.The game uses keyboard mostly, not exactly comfortable. Buttons it uses are arrows and right shifts, alt, ctrl, so it's kinda cluttered. It also has just one ""hold this to strafe"" button, so you can't circlestrafe around. Though, in this kind of FPS it would be useless. It also allows usage of mouse. Not for mouselook, nope. More as a replacament for arrows, it's used for movement. Yep, mouse back then was viewed as gimmick and not everybody knew how to make use of them.Your mission is to find exit elevator, while staying alive. To do this, you have to epxlore 1-floor maze of blocks, that are full of enemies, bonuses and doors. As well as 2 keys and locked doors. You know what to do with these. It's also littered with secret pushwalls, where you have to press ""open"" on a wall that you don't like and it may open, being pushed away for two blocks, revealing a secret passage. But there is no way to tell if this wall is a secret, as some of pushwalls have interesting texture while others aren't marked at all, thus creating uncertainty. Thus the only way to find them all is to hump all walls you see and that's tedius, not fun. MS-DOS version doesn't have any maps, so good luck navigating. The game uses scores and lives system that feel out of place in this not-so-arcadey game. You collect many treasures to increase your score. Nope, High Score Board sure isn't going to make you compete with Steam friends, it's as usual full of blank jokeyish entries. At least it saves your score. It also has lives system, where after death you will begin level again with only pistol and if you run out of lives, you get classic game over. But because you can save and load anytime and anywhere, no one cares.The selection of huge-pixeled (feature of DOS version, by the way) weapons that you get are simple. Way too simple, actually:Knife - Useless.Pistol - Fires bullets.Machine Gun - Fires bullets fast.Chaingun - Fires bullets very fast.You are going to use Machine Gun all the time anyway because Chaingun eats ammo too fast, not being able to shoot just one bullet. So it's pretty poor on thinking.And sure thing fighting enemies if main part of game. Soldiers are preplaced on the maze, standing and sometimes patrolling around, reminding that Wolfenstein 3D was supposed to be stealth game at first, as they take extra damage if they aren't aware of you. Once they notice you or hear you, they will let out some sort of ""achtung"" voice and start to chase you in a direct way. Nope, their footsteps are completely silent, so on some levels you should listen to doors opening carefully. Rarely it leads to fun mouse and cat scenarios, in which fun suddenly ends by getting shot into back. Most often it means a lot of dead bodies around nearest door. Actually, most often best tactic is to come into room, give a shot and then run back behind doorway's corner, as you just sit and camp, shooting enemies one after another. Not most exciting thing.Main problem comes from the fact that every enemy has only hitscan-based attack. So it's a game more about camping then running out and shooting everybody in a fair fight. And it's randomized in no end, bringing quite a frustation, as each bullet may either poke you slightly or completely kill you. It all depends on distance though, same for your bullets damage. Close range is deadly.Boss fights are disssapointing for video game. All of them are same. Pop out, shoot until they decide to shoot back, hide.  Go to secret stack of supply if it goes bad.So, a game that didn't age well, with cheap core gameplay. Still classic. If you want history, just play Shareware though. And if you do want full game, then only play first 3 episodes in short bursts.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												A classic.The original three episodes are still playable and enjoyable to this day if you use Ecwolf, which adds better controls and a much needed automap. However, I dislike the Nocturnal Missions because it's impossible to proceed without finding a certain secret. And finding most secrets is just gliding agaisnt a wall and smashing the use button, or simply using a walkthrough while playing.Wouldn't recommend.			",77,9,0,17,7,0,4

												Wolfenstein 3D feels more like a proof of concept than a proper game. Repetitive gameplay, poor level design, monotonous environments, and a lack of atmosphere makes for a boring experience. It still blows me away with what they were able to make this in '92, but if you want a great old-school FPS experience, start with Doom.And if you really want to play Wolfenstein 3D, get the ECWolf mod. It gives you a bigger aspect ratio in-game and lets you modify key bindings.			",151,99,0,22,19,1,17

												This is going to be an odd review, for the reason that I will mostly be reviewing this game with the idea that one is playing with a mod to polish this game a little bit, as the steam version feels very blurry and dated, and makes this game feel a lot less timeless than it really is. If you end up buying this game anyway, and try the mod I recommend, it's a good idea to view this as the 2D maze-like puzzle game where you have some sort of fog-of-war, because most can relate to a retro game rather than viewing this with the same standards of call of duty. This game has one serious flaw, and it's that you almost can't play the original version that steam sells.    The mod I recommend here is called ZDOOM, and while it's for Doom, it can be used for this game with a few tweaks. Overall it makes this game feel less like it did in 1992, and gives it the polished feel of a retro game made in the 80's that everyone can play, like Mario. ZDOOM fixes polishing issues in the game, such as resolution fixes, mouse and keyboard if you wish (even though I don't recommend it), texture fixes, and overall gameplay fixes that make this game a lot more timeless while still keeping the original atmosphere. I usually strongly dislike revamping old games (for example, SkyWind makes me cringe), but this fixes key issues that make this game not fun, while stuff like SkyWind just makes the game pretty, killing its original atmosphere and feel of the game.    Now that I've discussed how to be able to play this game with minimal frustrations, I'm going to be straightforward and tell you this is not a good game. I have about 15 hours off steam on this game, and based on my experiences, this game still has some serious problems that can't be fixed with something like ZDOOM. It's really obvious that this game is dated as hell, as it was the grandfather of FPS. You'd really think it's not that bad, but it is. It's a truly unplayable game when you get down to it; it's just not fun. A pros and cons list would be a good way to show this game's worth since ratings for games can be pretty subjective.Pros:- Managable fighting mechanics, ZDOOM gives this game simple controls and easy-to-learn combat. At first I didn't enjoy keyboard controls, but this game's map design really gives an interesting idea with it. The fact that you have to turn left and right does add a bit of challenge since the devs like putting enemies on both sides, and gives strategies that also include a mix of strafing (with alt key), and add a little more extra fun to the table, and trust me, you need that extra fun.- Has creative map layout at points, and the maps that try to be memorable (like secret levels, bosses, and aardwolf maze) are very memorable and I could still point them out. The did some interesting choices with the actual combat itself, and gives a more fun idea of fighting that really gives strategy. Like Doom, this game is known for having some serious consequences for not thinking and responding fast, and really gives some emotion out of the game.- Pretty playable, it's easy to beat a chapter in a day since missions are short and the game can be not enjoyable or bad, but just generic, so you can sometimes play a lot.- Uses an atmosphere and a premise of why you're fighting rather than a linear story, so you can get right into the action rather than having a boring, linear game with no thought put in yourself.- Better mechanics than a lot of modern games (difficulty in this game has more factors for it than Skyrim, and gives some variety there)- There's fun in the idea that there are a lot of modders that add their own flavor to some of the maps, and create their own original weapons and maps, and it's fun to play at least a couple. I'll send one to start with at the bottom of the review.Cons:- 4 types of enemies, most chapters don't show all at once. This really kills a lot of the fun, because it's just you doing the same thing over, and over, and over again, and I can understand that this game was made in 1992, but it just lacks polish for such a big game.- The normal levels really aren't memorable and it just seems like there lacks care in the level design, everything is bland and the same, and it's nothing exciting for so long.- Generic weapons that do the same amounts of damage and use the same ammo, just have different fire rates.- Can feel a bit clunky at times with movement, and looking around.- Overall a generic game, nothing seems exciting, and some points you just get so bored you quit and don't play the game for the rest of the day. All of the missions feel like the same thing over and over again, there's no interesting gun variety, no enemy variety, no variety for any factors in this game, even health and ammo drops are the same over and over again. I'd really say that doesn't make this game bad, but it's just not exciting. It would be different if there were a small amount of weapons but each were very unique, but each small variety of items adds nothing new to the table and feels the same as the last. If you're dealing with small variety and blandness, there's not only no content, but no fun with it, and that's just done poorly.    Overall, I'd really say this game isn't terrible, but it lacks map, weapon, enemy, health, and ammo variety, and ends up feeling like the same game over and over again. I'd personally recommend this over modern day Call of Duty because they're essentially the same game; a generic game with nothing really new or exciting in it. This game is somewhat timeless with ZDOOM, but movement can feel seriously clunky at times and it's just more of ""not fun"" than a ""dated"" or ""hard"" game with today's standards. If you're one to enjoy FPS and don't really care about variety then this game would be playable and pretty interesting to play, especially since you can be the guy who said ""I beat Wolf3D on 'I am Death Incarnate'!"" like me, but really, this game is nothing more than that, a game you can say you beat as bragging rights. EDIT: After beating Doom Shareware and Doom 2, I realized that I was a little harsh on keyboard controls when I first played the game, especially since the game is 2D and it's kind of fun to use left arrow keys to turn and then use a mix of strafing. Regardless, the controls are still kind of dated, and ZDOOM is still essential for making the game feel less old, especially the blurry graphics and bad resolution, plus slow turning and all that. You have a lot of choice in what controls you want to be and generally the game's just better with ZDOOM, so still pick it up.Also, as another edit, this game's map design isn't terrible, but it sure seems bad if this is the first old FPS you're playing. They have some originality, and you can tell there's some care, but overall it's not too original and not too hard. These games aren't that casual but they're not too hardcore either.https://www.m ediafire.com/?hjwl59bvsu9qv (Great standalone mod by Wolf Skevos-Jones)http://www.afadoomer.com/wolf3d/downloads.html (Wolf3D download for ZDOOM)http://zdoom.org/Download (ZDOOM)			",114,10,0,18,12,1,30

However, the controls are difficult to get used to, probably because there was no standard for FPS games at the time of this game's creation.  If you try to use a game controller, such as an Xbox 360 gamepad, then only up to four buttons will be recognized and there is no support for the sensitivity of the thumb sticks.  Everything is treated as digital input (as opposed to analog) except for the mouse.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Wolfenstein 3D is the grandfather of all first-person shooters.Pros: ClassicCons: Graphics, Sounds, Controls, Gameplay, RepetitiveWolfenstein 3D created the standard for the entire genre of first-person shooters.  Till its release in 1992, no other game had fully realized how a computer screen could be our eyes into a different world.  No other game had fully realized an environment and atmosphere so immersive that players could forget they were playing a game.That being said, Wolfenstein 3D is simply outdated.  The graphics, the sound, the controls, and gameplay are all outdated.  With exactly sixty levels, the game begins to bore after the first episode or so, especially with so few textures, enemies, weapons, etc.My recommendation is to play Wolfenstein 3D online under Bethesda's official release.  Specifically, play the third episode and fight against the first hordes of Nazi zombies and Mecha Hitler.  id Software has released Wolfenstein: The New Order, so if you appreciate the impact the company has had on the industry, you can support them by buying that instead.Get Psyched!10/10			",174,41,0,29,7,0,9

												The gameplay is almost unbearable, however, The soundtrack is still a classic. So there's definitely hope for this outdated piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I highly recommend the original Duke Nukem. Even though the remastered version looks alot better, in my opinion. It's still hard to compete with the classics. Although keep in mind Wolfenstein 3D is still considered the first official first-person shooter. It still beats beats dr jekyll and mr hyde any day. Although I'm still not certain if I'd even pay four dollars for this. I might've just been ripped off but I don't know, it's always nice visting the classics.			",40,0,0,8,8,0,4

												I really wanted to try and like this game, but it runs horribly. I would be able to ignore the outdated graphics if the controls were better. You can't change the controls from the mouse or arrows, to WASD. It feels clunky and not satisifying.This game should get a better port, or do something similar to the Doom 3BFG Edition. even the phone version is smoother...(Edit) I know the game is a classic and is the grandfather of shooters, I just wish I can experience it better			",83,3,0,4,5,0,1

												If you're reading this review, chances are you're already famliar with this game.In that case, this port is playable, and you can relive your old memories. Go for it.If you haven't heard of this game, then I recommend going in with an open mind. Wolfenstein 3D was one of the first popular first persion shooters, and helped propel the genre into the spotlight for many teenagers and college aged players. Between this, DOOM and Quake, a new culture spawned around shooters, mods, and map making (especially with the latter two games).However, the graphics have not aged well. If you're the kind of player who has reservations about playing old games because they're ""too blocky"" and you can't be immersed in that type of environment, then you may want to save your money and play one of the current Battlefield or Call of Duty games.Otherwise, the game mechanics dealing with ammo and health are interesting, the inclusion of secret areas and increasing your score by finding stolen treasure is a nice touch that can give ideas to game developers even today. The maze like structure in this game -- the same kind that was popular in many other games of the time -- may be a bit confusing for those used to always having a map where to go, but it also can help bring a bit more adventure and mystery. After finishing the game, you'll definitely feel a sense of accomplishment, and a new understanding and appreciation for where we've come from, and where we're at currently.			",194,20,4,14,15,2,35

												I played this game a while back, and honestly, i still think it's a great game. But not all things are perfect, but it's definitely worth picking up if you like the DOOM series.Pros:-Good game-Easily addictive-Pretty much started the gyro-3D genreCons:-Controls can be tricky at first-Pretty hard even on low difficulty-Sometimes crashed or tabbed out (I think that was due to DOS)Overall:  7.2 out of 10.This is of course all my opinion. Fans of nostalgic or gyro-3D games reccomended. People who don't like controls that are hard to get used to, don't really reccomend this one.			",96,10,0,19,16,0,15

												This is a GREAT classic game from the 90s! The level design is fantastic and I can complain about the rest! The only gripe I have with this game is DOSBox. The Steam version runs the original MS-DOS version of the game in the DOSBox emulator. This causes the game to be very laggy and run at a very low resolution. I would HIGHLY reccomend that you buy this then download ECWolf (Great source port of Wolf3D) and play it in that! (you will need to own it on steam to do so)			",112,6,0,7,3,0,4

												Wolfenstein 3D is a wonderful game.  As some of you readers probably know, this game is a sequel to the game Beyond Castle Wolfenstein made in 1984, and thus, this masterpiece of a first person shooter was created.This game was one of the first FPS games of its time, and was absolutely ground-breaking when it came out in 1992.  There is almost no other game like Wolfenstein 3D, except maybe for DOOM and Spear of Destiny.  This is quite possibly one of my favorite games of all-time, for its brilliant gameplay, idea, and weapons.  This game has stood the test of time, and is still enjoyable to this day.  I can still play this and get a kick out of it, even after the game being released 12 years ago.Amazingly, this was Id Software's second game!  And it was also their first 3D FPS, and is the reason Id was able to make the masterpiece of fiction we know as DOOM.  I love everything from the killing of Nazis, the controversy surrounding this game, the secrets, the fun and the plain stupidity of this game.  What I love about Wolfenstein 3D is how stupid it is, but unlike dumb modern shooters, this doesn't treat you like an idiot by shoving tutorials in your face, waiting for you to learn how to play the damn game.  Wolfenstein 3D represents what has been lost from the First Person Shooter genre, which is the soul.I have played countless shooters with a sad lack of soul to it.  Wolfenstein 3D is a great game, and truly one of the finest FPSs ever made on the face of the planet, and that's why I recommend this game.			",436,138,6,53,30,5,43

												The forefather of the modern FPS, the fast-paced, tense and colorful arcade-like gameplay is still compelling today. As Nazi prisoner B.J. Blazcowitz, it's up to you to escape from the bowels of a Nazi prison and steamroll over Hitler's goons on your way to the ultimate shodown with the paragon of evil himself, Adolf Hitler.

												This game is interesting. I haven't much time to play it yet but i wanted to at least get out my opinion so far. So far, it's great. Not the best game I've played but it's quite decent and for some reason I find it soooo rewarding to shoot Nazi's. Yeah, and the only real problem i have is it's controls. You basically play the whole game with your mouse so yeah. Already sounds pretty weird. I can't even really explain it but if you can get past the awkward controls I do believe this is a good game with some value in it, so if you've got some extra cash lying around. Maybe you should pick this up, unless you don't have Terraria. Defiantly get Terraria.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily one of the hardest, most frustrating and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed FUN games I've played. It is incredibly tough, but not unfairly so- all the resources you need are in the level, with yet more hidden. Level design is a bit archaic- at times it's really just a maze, and the samey wall textures don't help- but learning the maps, finding secrets and paying attention to your surroundings will reward you greatly. Enemy soldiers are unforgiving and have very fast reaction times that you will have to beat to survive, and at times there will be very many of them. It simply has to be played on the highest difficulty.It is an FPS stripped down all the way, demanding from you only raw determination and skill. It's not as brilliantly designed as Doom, nor as clever and intuitive as Quake, but Wolfenstein 3D is still a very worthy member of id Software's trinity of shooters and a classic in its own right.By the way, the game comes packed with Dosbox on Steam. Dosbox sucks. Download ECwolf, copy the contents of the ECwolf folder to the folder named ""base"" in the Wolf3d directory, delete dosbox.exe, and rename ecwolf.exe to dosbox. Tweak your resolution and controls in the settings, and you're good to go.			",261,50,0,30,28,2,45

												I'd recommend downloading a program called 'ecwolf' since it uses modern controls. The default controls for this game are the arrow keys and you can't set the controls to use WASD to move and strafe. The program 'EC Wolf"" has this option and is the highly recommended way to play the game. It also can upscale the game into HD graphics which look nicer. Another problem with this game is that it lags which shouldn't happen on any modern computer. EC Wolf also addresses this problem. Still, this game is a classic as it is the first FPS ever made and set the standard for more advanced first person shooter games developed by id Software such as Doom and Quake.

												One of the earliest FPS games ever made, Wolfenstein 3D has a lot of historical importance, and with a lot people playing it and having fond memories with it, its still considered a great game. Do I think its good well...Yes and no.First things first this port is crap. Its just a DOSbox shell which would be fine, but the configuration is absolute garbage. You have to do a lot of DOSBOX config changes before the game is even playable.After that you are left with a game that is fun, but only in short bursts. That isn't really a knock against the game as a whole because it was one of the earlist FPS games ever made, but rather a warning to you if you choose to buy it.Wolfenstein 3D has a lot of flaws in 2015 that weren't really apparent back in 1992. The levels are repetetive mazes that are easy to get lost in and theres no map which worsens the issue. The controls by default are clunky and hard to use (though this is fixable but not on this release alone, a source port will fix this) the game is unfairly difficult, the list goes on.But its still a really FUN game.The shooting is very fun and the 3 guns that you get in the game are all fun to use. Especially the chaingun with its loud sounds and sheer power. Killing things is really fun in this game thanks to great sound effects, good hit detection and good animation. The game is fun, but it hasn't exactly aged well, but if you can tolerate its problems Wolfenstein 3D is still a fun game. If anything you should buy for its historical importance. The visuals are basic, no surprise there, but they don't look bad. The sprites are very detailed and the textures look good. The textures do tend to repeat and the levels are complex in design but basic in look. There are no multileveled floors, the levels are flat and static, but again this game was released in 1992 so its okay.The music is really good, I love that twangy Sound Blaster\Adlib sound that many DOS games had at the time and this is no exception. The sound effects are also good.Overall I recommend this game only if you know if you are getting into. You have to know how to tweak the DOSbox config file before starting (unless you get a source port) and this game does have a lot of flaws by todays standards, but its historically important and for that reason alone you should give Wolfenstein 3D a try,			",109,11,3,5,3,1,2

												Well I have played this alot recntly and seeing how The New Order and The Old Blood are released I want to review it. So Wolfenstein 3D is argueably the most important game in the FPS genre besides DOOM and I can't praise it enough but how does it hold up today? Well I love this game not only for how it is a WW2 game and you kill Hitler but how arcady and how much shooting there is. Now it is mainly key hunting and exit hunting but is still alot of fun. Now if there is one complaint I have it is the maze level design and since there is no map to open up it is hard to navigate some of the levels to find the exit but if there one major complaint I have it is the final three episodes. There is one specific level where if you open up the wrong wall you mess everything up. But all that asside this is a great game I give it a 9.5/10.			",71,0,0,3,2,0,1

												Now for myself and many other gamers, Wolfenstein has a special place in our hearts. It was the first FPS game I played and loved thoroughly, back when it was on floppy disk and your computer screen was tiny and your computer managed little more than 512MB of RAM. The way you picked up weapons with universal ammo. Ah, the nostalgia is real. The way th pixels moved. The enemies that actually shot at you and gave you something to do with that Luger that only had 8 rounds in this castle that you don't know how you got into. Then you cleared the first level and made your way through to find a secret room with... DUN DU DU DUH! An MP40! With your newly found weapon you blaze through the Nazis faster than before and finish the second level. You enter the third floor and think ""OK. more of the same: Nazi's and German Shepards. This will be a cake walk"". Well, you're right but then with your will to find secret rooms you uncover one and inside....... A CHAINGUN! You look down and see the devilish face the character gives and you finish the level even faster. Just buy it. It was the best buck forty I've ever spent!			",49,1,0,4,3,0,0

												Wolfenstein 3D, the game that put FPS games on the map, still holds up today.Ever since its initial release in 1994, Wolfenstein 3D has brought life to today's FPS franchises.It is truly the grandfather of modern FPS games.Like I said, it still holds up today. The challenging combat, the nonlinear levels, and the gunplay still make it a relevant game. Wolfenstein 3D has had a long lifespan, and it seems that it's not even close to dying.If you want to go back to the roots of a popular game genre and have a lot of fun doing so, Wolfenstein 3D is certainly the game for you.

												I was 10 when this came out. My friend's dad's 486 was a beast of a machine, and this was one of the games we would fire up to play.At the time, this was the BIGGEST FPS, mainly because it was the FIRST* FPS to hit the PC, and began the onslaught of titles to this day.Duke Nukem 3D, Goldeneye 64, Half-Life, Painkiller, Payday, Killing Floor, Call Of Duty, Battlefield, GTA V (First Person Mode) - ALL of these and many more have THIS GAME to thank for starting the FPS legend by kicking Nazi♥♥♥♥♥♥ looting their stolen gold stash and taking down Hitler LONG before anyone else.PRICELESS/10 - how does one rate a gaming legend that gives you it and so many more titles to enjoy?(Worth getting just to see how it all began, especially if you play the modern Wolfenstein titles! That dream sequence? This is why B.J dreams in retro. ;) )* = There was ONE title before Wolf3D, but it wasn't as well known, nor that fun. Wolf3D spread ACROSS THE WORLD BEFORE THE INTERNET. On 3.5"" floppy disks, in vending machines!			",230,78,9,25,26,5,32

Im really surpirised no one deleted it from the system. but playing it again brought back all those awesome memories of getting on a computer before the grade sixes got there first and playing whiile they watch in amazement of how good i was (even if i was playing the lowest difficulty) If you ever played this game in your childhood play it agian. if it wasnt in your childhood get it anyway and see what gave you what we have today.I love these old games and how they force you to figure s**t out with no help but colour coded walls and an ultimate objective.

												Nostalgiafest circa 1994. The only non-educational game my parents ever let us keep on the computer and play when I was a child. If that's not an endoresment, I don't know what is. Perhaps they just found shooting Nazis to be educational in its own right.Very fun old-school FPS that helped shape the gaming world as we know it. Keeping track of and strategizing where you've been and where you still need to go, without the minimap option we're used to most games having now, adds another dimension to the gameplay. If you're a young whippersnapper and constantly feel the need to be wowed by cutting edge graphics and extras and you also lack an appreciation for history, you may not appropriately admire and enjoy this game--if such is the case, I simply ask you please be so kind as to remove yourself from mein lawn, danke.For those of us who were around to play pc games in the 90s, who grew up in tandem with such games and remember when this was cutting edge, you will not regret the $5 spent for a game that takes up minimal space for maximum nostalgia.

												I played this game a while back, and honestly, i still think it's a great game. But not all things are perfect, but it's definitely worth picking up if you like the DOOM series.Pros:-Good game-Easily addictive-Pretty much started the gyro-3D genreCons:-Controls can be tricky at first-Pretty hard even on low difficulty-Sometimes crashed or tabbed out (I think that was due to DOS)Overall:  7.2 out of 10.This is of course all my opinion. Fans of nostalgic or gyro-3D games reccomended. People who don't like controls that are hard to get used to, don't really reccomend this one.			",96,10,0,19,16,0,15

												Ah, Wolfenstein 3d. Many, incudling myself, would say that this game helped establish the First Person Shooter genre. Why would we, in 2015 (as of writing), want to play a 23 year old relic of gaming past? Well, it's because despite its age, and its primitive appearance, everything that makes the genre what we know it to be today is here. After all, this is the blueprint to the FPS genre. The gameplay is here, and there's a certain freedom that this and many games like it have that more modern games seem to lack. Sure, as I said before, the graphics are dated and it looks like a mess someone drew in MS Paint compared to pretty much anything since then. Sure, the voice samples are goofy when guards see you and yell in broken German and let out death cries ranging from cringeworthy to gut bustingly hilarious, but that's part of its charm. Wolfenstein 3d is a game that doesn't take itself to seriously and doesn't expect you to either. So, as inexpensive as it is to have one of the most vital pieces of gaming history to enjoy for yourself, you would be kind of silly not to get it and try it at least once.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wolfenstein 3D still has something to offer modern games who are looking for a bit of nostalgia. Although this wasn't the first FPS, it was the first blockbuster hit that really established the FPS as a genre. However, the game doesn't hold up very well today.Wolfenstein 3D is fun, but also very frustrating. Here are a few problems. 1) The controls are so atrocious that the game is practically unplayable, but a source port program like ECWolf can be used to update the control scheme. 2) The layout of levels is sprawling, and the blocky and repetitive architecture give most levels an annoying maze-like feel. 3) The game is weird with corners, meaning that sometimes enemies can see and shoot you around a corner, but you can't see them. 4) The mutant enemy type will often shoot you instantaneously on sight, without you having time to react. 5) There are only a few types of weapons and enemies, and combat quickly becomes repetitive. 6) The built-in auto-aim can be clunky and unreliable.Ultimately, I recommend Wolfenstein 3D because it is still fun to play despite its many failings, which admittedly will keep some FPS fans from enjoying it. My advice is to play it with the ECWolf source port (or another like it), and to enjoy the game in small doses, playing a level or two per day so that it won't become tedious. If you want some nostalgia and can appreciate an older game in spite of its limitations, then Wolfenstein 3D is a good buy.			",16,0,0,1,0,0,0

												The one that started it all…  While it is true that the first-person perspective did exist prior to Wolfenstein 3-D. It was Wolfenstein that truly created the First-Person Shooter, I don’t care what other people might say.The game takes place inside a Nazi prison of sorts, inside castle Wolfenstein.  You being an Allied soldier that was able to get the jump on one of your guards.  Now find yourself looking for a way out.  But instead of just finding a door and leaving, you opt to work your way deeper into the castle with plans to defeat Hitler yourself.This game has had its fair share of controversy over the years, as well as its sequels.  But at the end of the day it is now the same thing it was 20 years ago.  A game, an outlet, an entertainment piece.  This might have been the first time ID caught heat for some of the content in their games, but it wouldn’t be the last…Overall its a solid game, my only complaint with it is the graphics being so dated they have a tendency to cause migraines after prolonged playtime.  And while I won’t down mark the game for its graphics, I will mark it for my pain and suffering.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Enemies that really look like ""humans""!The leveldesign was also very good, well thought off and sometimes really complex, because you needed to find the 2 keys to end the level.Also the Boss fights at the end of every chapter where cool!! especially the first one, the bigg giant blue Robot. Right after you open the second door a giant robot appears that says""Guten Tag!"" and blows the♥♥♥♥♥♥our of you, at least he tries ;)And the moment you actually killed the robot, the last thing he says is ""Mutti"" haha perfect!Remember, this game started it all! all time classic!

												This is the game where it all began... The FPS, but then Doom was much more famous.I remember to play this game from a Floppy Disk. Simple control. Simple sound. Simple gameplay.I don't even really mind back then about the story. All I know that I have to find the door and kill anyone on sight, including dogs. To be honest, I cannot review this game as I review other FPS game nowaday. This game is recommended for you who want to know the history of Wolfenstein. ",86,2,1,2,12,0,2

												Wolfenstein 3D is one of the trinity of games from id software, that make FPS on what it is known todayA classic like Super Mario Bros.,but its gameplay,like the former,is very dated.The game has 6 chapters with 10  stages each,full of secret passages to discover and nazis to shoot.Stuff like repetitive enviroments, lack of variety on weapons and stiffy controls may turn you away.But if you just want a kick♥♥♥♥♥shooter from the early 90's where you kill the fuhrer,no questions asked,this is the way to go.

												It's a classic, but a FPS is NOT fine wine. It doesn't age well. That's simply a given. While it was a huge advancement for it's time, for anyone not simply playing for the nostalgia, it just doesn't have enough to offer that would make me play it over something new.EDIT: Jesus Christ what the ♥♥♥♥ was freshman me's ♥♥♥♥ing damage? It holds up just fine. God damn, I was edgy.			",127,22,0,21,16,2,33

												Wolfenstein 3D is clearly a rough predecessor to DOOM; there's a lives system that doesn't make sense considering the save function, there's only one ammo type, the levels are of a uniform height and are easy to get lost in, there are fewer of DOOM's level design tricks (that is to say, putting an enemy in a corner you normally wouldn't look in), both you and the enemies are far easier to kill, and there's just less content overall. In addition, it helped popularize first person shooters for an audience that probably hadn't seen one ever before, but then DOOM came along and...well, you know. For pure quality and importance to game history, DOOM is superior in pretty much every way.However, on its own merits, it's a decent game that drags a little too much in the middle and was enough of a hit at the time to allow id Software to go onto bigger and better things. Also, it makes fun of the Nazis by portraying them as straight-up cartoon villains with mech suits and swastika-shaped bases and Hitler vampires, so that's good. I'd say buy it to experience a piece of gaming history, 'cause that's what I did.EDIT: I did not play the Nocturnal Missions, because 1) they didn't come with the original release, and 2) once you've killed Hitler, you've won the game as far as I'm concerned.

												The first game that took the then very basic concept of an FPS and solidified it, setting the groundwork for practically every game to follow. While most certainly barebones due to age, it's a great challenge even by modern standards and still a blast to play.Downloading the ECWolf sourceport to run the game is highly recommended (it even automatically looks for steam installs of the game!) for improved graphic and control options, as well as to remedy any issues you may run into running DOSBox.

												I can't even begin to explain how much I love Wolfenstien 3-D.  It was the second video game I ever played in my life.  I started playing it when I was 3 or 4 years old and I still remember going on my dad's windows 95 computer to play it.  If you have Window's 8, like myself, and you plan on getting this you will notice it runs very slow and the sound is rather choppy.  You can fix this by downloading ECWolf and running the game with it.  Here's a link: http://maniacsvault.net/ecwolf/download.php.  Now on to the game it's self.  Wolfenstien 3-D was released by ID software on May 5th, 1992, and was considered the ""Pioneer of FPS Games.""  I bought it on steam just for nostalgia, and I still enjoy playing it to this day.  There's just something about blasting through waves of Nazis that feels so satisfying.  There are a good variety of enemies and bosses.  There is a story, but it's not presented to well.  There are 6 episodes, each one has a paragragh you can read about that somewhat gives you an idea about the story.  For anyone who judges a game by its graphics (I don't) you have to understand that this was made in 1992, what do you expect.  Overall, I love this game to death.   This, Super Mario World, and Doom, were the games of my childhood.			",256,27,0,24,11,1,6

												Classic but definitley clunky. Surprisingly satisfying shooting, not a ton of weapons but when one packs a punch you can't help but smile. The strafing and mouse-look controls are not ideal and so are a little sloppy to use; though this doesn't ruin the game, it does make movement less natural (and enjoyable) for those who have been spoiled by modern control schemes. Some levels are frustratingly easy to get lost in because rooms generally look similar and there is no map. Not as timeless as the Doom series but classic, interesting, and fun. Recommended if you're into video game history.			",627,196,20,94,67,7,113

												Ah, Wolfenstein 3d. Many, incudling myself, would say that this game helped establish the First Person Shooter genre. Why would we, in 2015 (as of writing), want to play a 23 year old relic of gaming past? Well, it's because despite its age, and its primitive appearance, everything that makes the genre what we know it to be today is here. After all, this is the blueprint to the FPS genre. The gameplay is here, and there's a certain freedom that this and many games like it have that more modern games seem to lack. Sure, as I said before, the graphics are dated and it looks like a mess someone drew in MS Paint compared to pretty much anything since then. Sure, the voice samples are goofy when guards see you and yell in broken German and let out death cries ranging from cringeworthy to gut bustingly hilarious, but that's part of its charm. Wolfenstein 3d is a game that doesn't take itself to seriously and doesn't expect you to either. So, as inexpensive as it is to have one of the most vital pieces of gaming history to enjoy for yourself, you would be kind of silly not to get it and try it at least once.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
