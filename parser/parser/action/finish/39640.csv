												This game is very underrated. The story, characters and dialogues are clearly adult-themed and dark. Like Aquanox 1 it shows well the madness of a post apocalyptic underwater society.			",367,125,17,38,37,4,27

												Truly an improvement over its predecessor, Aquanox 2 progresses faster, the graphics look good and introduce more colorful environments, and the dialogue is much improved.  If it's ever on sale, you should pick it up.  Check out my full review here:

												I played it a huge amount of time back in the day when it came out and now finally got it on steam.The setting is dark, unique and twisted, the visuals aged quite well and the gameplay still is great. Up to 4 Ships are fully customizable and differ your approach and outcome of each mission individually. The missions vary from escorts over large-scale pirate-battles to stealthmissions, there also are some bonus-goals and free-roam after most missions.if you like non(or less) generic shooters this might be for you			",152,34,6,9,12,0,11

												*Note: this review is based on the GOG version, and is shortened; go there for the full review.*Unique and Fun: 4/5Aquanox 2 is a strict improvement on the first game, reducing or eliminating most of the irritations of its predecessor, as well as offering more overall polish.  VISUALS:  I thought Aquanox 1 had aged well, thanks in great part to good use of textures; Aquanox 2 is a definite visual upgrade, with everything using more polygons, crisp textures, nicer lighting, and much cleaner effects. The improved sharpness solves the issue of vision being obscured by weapon flare in crowded combats, but clearly seeing torpedoes and weapon trails from 20 ships preserves that great hectic feel. The strong styling of each faction is preserved, and the upgraded models look excellent.  One thing I didn't really notice until I returned briefly to the original is that the HUD is *tremendously* improved. Not only is it sharper and more attractive (as the game is designed for higher resolutions), but it is also far more useful.  CONTROLS:  As before, you have an odd set of 5 degrees of freedom: three axes of linear movement, pitch up and down, and banking (instead of simply yawing [turning] left and right, you roll and pull upward to turn, with a tunable degree of automatic leveling). I guess the rolls make it feel more simulator-y, but the implementation is rough and it interferes with aiming. Aquanox 2 adds an ""FPS mode"" toggle, but that didn't seem to make circle-strafing more possible. The problematic vertical axis through which you can't rotate (you can never roll or flip so far that the floor is ""above"" you) is much better here than in the first game - aiming at a moving target above or below you is still a bit rough because the auto-leveler will swing you around, but tracking a target as it passes over or under you is much cleaner than before.  The control scheme does take some getting used to, even if you're a veteran of 6DOF games like Descent. As the game progresses, you may find that maneuvering skills adequate for one enemy type are insufficient to defend against new enemies, and you will of course benefit from tuning your movement style to the strengths of your current ship. This means that there is a continuous learning curve to the game, at least on your first playthrough. Due to this, I wouldn't recommend the game to someone looking for quick lightweight simulator fun. That said, the ships generally feel more responsive than those in Aquanox 1, with the caveat that there is more noticeable handling difference between the heavy and light ships than before.  Although there is still a sometimes disappointingly low ceiling, more vertical space is available than before, and vertical positioning has a much stronger tactical role in combat. I found myself using both terrain features and the bodies of capital ships significantly more in this than in it its predecessor, and that really improved the feel of underwater freedom of motion.  STORY/ACTING:  This was possibly the biggest downfall of Aquanox 1: the grating voice acting that made me want to murder several wingmen and made me fear their talking more than the wasted effort when I had to replay a level. Thankfully, that has been completely fixed. There is still radio banter between the skipper and your wingmen, but it is always related to the current action, no one has a fingernails-on-chalkboard voice, and the delivery is generally decent. This alone is the single most important improvement in the game.  The story is odd but somewhat interesting, and in another vast improvement over Aq1, there are no more droning plot summaries by the protagonist as you travel from area to area. If you want, you can quick-skip any conversation and just jump from battle to battle.  All that said, there are still a couple problems. First, the long opening and ending videos, while interesting, seem to have extremely little relation to the plot of the game, but this is a very minor issue. Second, there is a romance sub-plot that will railroad you along a path that has obvious bad consequences.  DIFFICULTY:  As with Aquanox 1, the unusual controls and wobbly turning may be an issue, but they're acceptable once you get used to them. Again, those used to flight sims will lament the lack of a lead indicator.  Bonus objectives make for an interesting twist on gameplay: although many are merely ""find a hidden freighter"", a few are rewards for showing extra skill or doing more dangerous things in combat. It is irritating that you are not told what the objectives are, but you are often given hints in radio chatter.  As with the previous game, difficulty can vary extensively and there are a few really hard missions. The harder ""boss fights"" are generally either standalone duels or are front-loaded so that you don't have to repeatedly replay tedious sections only to die at the end. There are a fair number of ""protect the Harvester"" missions, but even on high difficulty she's a sturdy ship and will generally survive as long as you don't wander away from combat for too long. Sometimes there are critical targets that need to be destroyed in small time windows to achieve protection, but once you get the hang of this, it's not too bad, just challenging. Huge battles can happen without being overwhelming, and the final big battle is a both a great set-piece and a lot of fun.  LEVELS, STRATEGY, and OTHER ELEMENTS:  Completing bonus objectives will net you some nice loot including some unique upgrades that can really make a difference in some missions, but you can do without them and will have acquired a pretty full complement of weapons by the end of the game no matter what. EMP weapons are more widely used this time (and feel less forced), although don't believe the manual or Fuzzyhead about being able to salvage anything you disable - only specific bonus targets will grant salvage (there are, however, over a dozen such goodie bags). Sparing the lives of several major characters will not only give you a bonus but result in bonus missions later in the game, which I thought was a very nice touch. Early on, EMP may be your strongest weapon against a few high-armor targets, and the second-generation EMP missiles available in the late game can one-shot most enemies.  I actually used almost every weapon in the game at least several times, as each has a useful tactical role to play, making gun and upgrade load out a nice tactical consideration in addition to your torpedo selection. You only have access to 4 ships in the game, all provided by the plot, but they feel better differentiated than the options in Aq1, and your newest ship is not always the best choice.  Finally, the replay value is significantly enhanced by a vastly improved ""instant action"" selection including every game mission (unlocked as you beat them), as well as the provision of 40 save slots.  THE VERDICT:  Aquanox 2 fixed or at least improved on all the aspects that forced me to give its predecessor a 3, and has certainly earned its 4. It could use more work (particularly in tightening up the controls), but it has no glaring flaws left, and it's quite fun once you learn to play well. Different classes of enemy move and behave differently, and thus require different tactics to come out on top (as do large battles vs small dogfights); this really makes the game much richer and keeps you on your toes as the game progresses. I was particularly impressed with the execution of protection missions (so often a source of pain) and the great feel of large-scale battles, and the ""boss fights"" were never gimmicky find-the-weak-spot puzzle bosses, just extra-tough ships with good pilots and escorts. If you like space combat sims, it would be worth giving a spin for its unique feel.			",510,118,7,58,46,5,103

												Russian and EnglishИтак перед нами продолжение симулятора подводного истребителя AquaNox. В общем игра неплоха - но к сожалению она не дотягивает до уровня 2 части потому что: 1) Управляемость и маневренность лодок значительно ухудшилась 2) Броня ЗНАЧИТЕЛЬНО ухудшена - иногда миссия выигрывается чудом 3) Океан стал слишком мутным - понятно что вода имеет разные оттенки на разных глубинах - но это разработчики упустили 4) САМОЕ УЖАСТНОЕ - количество лодок - в 1 части мы видели более 10 разновидностей со своими нюансами, здесь лодок всего 4 - получаются все строго по сюжету и ничем они не отличаются кроме скорости и времени смерти (+ 0.9 сек под мощным огнём) 5) слишком много скрытых объектов в миссиях и плохая балансировка - иногда проигрываешь только потому что пропустил кого-то мелкого а тот расковырял защищаемый объект 6) слишком мало торпед с собой и плохая наводимость некоторых спец-пушек (""Гидра"") 7) Мало боссов и они не к месту - не ждите эпической драки в конце эпизода 8) некоторые типы пушек крайне бесполезны для игрока но почему-то для АI они самое оно - выгребаете вы просто жутко больноВ общем если вам понравился AquaNox берите и эту часть. Игра довольно долгая - но диалоги теперь имеют титровку так что читать удобно. Лодка теперь поменялась - у нас теперь есть броня разного борта как в Privateer так что если вам почти пробили лоб - готовтесь отступать (если есть хороший рем.бот) или переигрывать миссию (если это начало). Значительно улучшили города - теперь диалоги более живые - так видно обстановку где Вильям Дрейк разговаривает.Но боевая модель значительно пострадала - теперь бои крайне сложны из-за плохой управляемости и малой прочности + некоторые пушки по эффекту хороши - но практике косят так что смешно. Так что перед заданием Обязательно сохранитесь.Вердикт - игра хороша но многое из хорошего 1 части было вырезано и миссии так и не поправили.So we have continue of AquaNox's underwater sub-fighter simulator. In general - good, but it isn't so good as AquaNox 2 must be, because: 1) Maneuvering and controls of subs become very bad 2) Armor significantly REDUCED - sometimes win in mission are miracle itself 3) Ocean became very foggy - i understand that water isn't same colour in different depths - but devs ignored that 4) BADDEST THING - number of subs - in AquaNox we have more then 10 different types (and they aren't similar) - here only 4 strictly by storyline and only difference is speed of movement and death (max armored + 0.9 sec under heavy fire) 5) too many hidden objects in missions and balance of missions is bad - sometimes loose because you didn't noticed some small enemy in hard fight and it destroyed clue object 6) very few torpedos in sub and bad locking of some special guns 7) Few bosses and they aren't in good story points - so don't expect of boss at the end of episode 8) some guns are pretty useless for player - but EXTREMELY good for AI - it drops rain of fire to you nad it's really dangerousIn general if you liked AquaNox better to take AquaNox 2. The game is long - but dialogs now have subtitles so now it is easy and good to read them. Sub has been changed now we have 4 sided armor like in Privateer - so if enemy almost penetrate your front armor plating get ready to retreat (if you have good repair module) or restart mission (the beggining). Cities were updated very good - dialogues now more meeting like - cause now you see atmosphere when William Drake is talking. But combat model become awful because to control sub now is very hard and it has very low survivalibility + some guns have very good effects but they are missing to hit targets oftenly (very annoying). So before mission - SAVE.Verdict - game is good but too much good from AquaNox were cutted and misions weren't fixed properly. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is supposed to be reboot of the series. Gameplay can be found on youtube (guy talks in german). After watching the video I can say it's going to be more of an Archimedean Dynasty reboot.

												1. What is Aquanox 2?Aquanox 2 is the sequel to the sci-fi-underwater shooter Aquanox 1.2. Do I have to play the first game before I start with Aquanox 2?No, because Aquanox 2 has its own storyline and you will play as a new main character. You will meet some characters from the first game, but you won´t miss much if you didn ´t play the first game.3. Is it worth buying?If you liked the first game or games like X-Wing vs Tie-Fighter or Wing Commander, you should give this one a try.4. I played Aquanox 1, what is the difference between the first and the second game?As I mentioned you will play a new main character. The new storyline is pretty good, more serious and not as cheesy as the first game. The graphics are not as colourful as the first game, but with better textures and its a little darker now with brown colours. The voice acting also improved a bit.5. Can I still choose different ships and upgrade my weapons?Yes there are not as many ships anymore in the game, but still enough to have a decent variety. The weapons from the first game return and are more easy to shoot (higher bullet velocity and shorter travel speed). You can still upgrade your ships and weapons. You can now sell your equipment or store it outside your ship.6. What are the missions like?You will be able to speak to your crew members often before or after the missions. You can prepare yourself and read the mission text before you start. The missions also vary between exploration, destruction, escape or protection. Often you will have some wingmen to help you out.If you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews. Thanks!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're looking for something different in a world dominated by shooters and MMORPGs, the Aquanox series is a good choice. Set in the depths of the ocean, in a post-apocalyptic world where mankind was forced to give up the light of the sun and the dryness of the land, Aquanox 2: Revelation has you playing as William Drake, a young freighter pilot who is sucked into an adventure that he only dreamt of as a kid. THE GOOD: The game is pretty unique, and it allows you to play using either FPS controls, or a more realistic mode in case you like a challenge. The story is great, and draws you in. The game doesn't require powerful hardware, you can play it on any potato PC.THE BAD: The save system is ancient and you have to finish a mission before you can make a new save - however this makes it more challenging and thus more rewarding for people who like it that way. The dialogue is tedious at times, and although you can skip it, it's better if you go through it, as plenty of story elements don't come through pure gameplay. Graphics are also ancient, but there's a new game that will bring that to the table pretty soon (check Aquanox: Deep Descent).TLDR: Buy if you want something different than the current crop of FPS and MMORPG games. Set your expectations for graphics and gameplay mechanics aside, this is an old game - but a worthwile one.			",77,5,0,1,4,0,2

												I really want to like this game but I just can't. It's the kind of game you'd like to replay more often than you do, but then you remember all the bad parts you have to sit through on the way. The gameplay is fun if you're doing what you would expect to be doing in this kind of game, namely fighting bad guys. Sadly, that happens maybe 25% of the time at best. Many missions in this game have you sloooowly make your way towards your destination or wait for enemies/alles to appear, followed by either a minor skirmish which is over before you know it, or an extremely difficult battle which you are likely to lose even after trying numerous times. Other missions make you navigate a maze of instant-kill lasers or attack fortified bases guarded by dozens of turrets that annihilate you if you're not as careful as can be. Almost every mission works the same way: you wait a couple minutes for something to happen; when something does happen, it's either not fun and takes up to half an hour, or it actually is fun and it's over within a minute. I'm sad to say that only a few missions make for an exception to this rule.The story is actually pretty decent but on the way there you're given so much insignificant filler that you just tune out and don't even care about the important parts anymore. Some dialogue wants to get you thinking, some of it is trying way too hard to be smart, some of it makes no sense whatsoever. Sometimes the two characters doing conversation seem to be talking about two completely different things, which actually adds some realism to the game as that is the way things are in real life sometimes too.Once again, I'd really love to rate this game better than I do, because somehow the first AquaNox was always a special game to me. It really isn't completely horrible but it makes you really moan about all the things that aren't fun about it.			",24,10,4,10,5,1,5

												Okay, that old review which I wrote yesterday was very short-lived. Out with the old, in with the new. Game beat. Wow.My god. Aquanox 2 is fantastic. You just float around, doing missions of various kinds, and it stays pretty fresh throughout the whole game. You're constantly finding new weapons ever few missions with which to keep the exploding of enemy subs exciting, and while it starts off pretty easy, the game gets a bit more challenging by the end. There's even a boss fight! It's getting old, how many games today don't have boss fights.The story is... well, let's be honest. It's interesting. The characters are interesting enough, I guess, despite the fact most of them don't really change very much over the course of the game. Once or twice the dialogue gets... weird. As in, ""what the hell was the guy writing this stuff smoking"" because of the way it looks, sounds and feels like the two characters are suddenly jumping between two conversations with one another that don't make any sense.I wouldn't say it's a big deal, but if you don't like listening to and reading a lot of dialogue, this game may not be for you. There's not even that much, but you are forced to click around the ship or city, wherever you are at the time, to talk to every single possible person so you get every available job and trigger whatever other dialogue is coming your way. Or whatever. I personally can easily accept this. Not everyone else can, especially in an FPS which is otherwise considered to be completely action based.There's no real RPG elements here. But you can choose what weapons you take on any given mission, choose what sub you're taking, as well as choose to invest in different bits and pieces from whatever arsenal you can find. There's only really three or so opportunities to buy or sell though, which is kind of a shame. There's also, like I said, a lot of clicking around before and after missions. So I can see why some might tag this as an RPG - just, you're not roleplaying any old character, you are roleplaying as Captain Drake or whatever.Anyway, gameplay. It's immaculate. If you have a joystick, and you love your joystick, hey, you can have fun here easy. If you want to use your keyboard, same deal. The controls for both can be swapped on the fly, and you can fly sim with just your keyboard and mouse too, if you really want, for more immersion. I personally stick with the FPS thing because I know it and love it, but, hey.Torpedoes are good fun, but I generally don't use them. Mostly because they have a relatively long cooldown, can be dodged by buzzers (aka flares to you flight sim guys) and can sometimes just be dodged full stop. This is really kind of a shame if I'm honest, since you'd think they'd work something like bombs. But as it is, especially once you get later into the game, you end up with railguns and stuff that do just as much if not more damage than your average torpedoes.It's weird to suggest, but the ending cutscene is well worth it. After all of that effort, and you finally get that reward, and it's a big cutscene detailing everything, ending the game perfectly, on a ""to be continued"" essentially, which I find pretty funny considering we never got a third game... and in fact there's little trace of the Aquanox series anywhere on the internet in terms of story, so I guess nobody will ever really know how it ends or how it even ties into the first game. Just be creative I guess.I mean, all in all, I could recommend this for the sole reason that it's a fantastically pretty, imaginative, original game made in a genre that today has become more green and stale than hard bread.If back in the day (like, 2003 lol) people could make games like this, why can't we make new games even half as good as Aquanox?

												Aquanox 2 is great, oldschool PS1/2 graphics, metaltechnopunky soundtrack, descent-like first person submarine shoot em up action. Great story and characters, upgrade and shop system, overall feels like an outstanding game especially for its time.			",1309,271,33,78,64,11,107

												I don't normally write bad reviews, especially with such little time, but this game is old and bad. I don't recommend it. the mechanics are bad. the opening story is what drew me in, however the gameplay is horrible.			",50,17,0,4,3,0,7

												Interesting concept. I have been thinking why there aren't more undersea games for a long time. This game is just too difficult. Too much reliance in twitchy pointlessness and too many enemies with too little ship. It wasn't even worth the $1.00 I paid for it. There is a cheat for this impossible game, but it too proved t be too difficult to figure out as well which seems appropriate somehow...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought on basis of good reviews however none of them said how slow and boring the combat was. Gave up after the third mission. Probably unfair to review it? But I am. Basically the story seesm ok, graphics are nice but old, but thats not the biggest issue. The biggest turn off was the combat. Its really reall dull and boring.And thats it really, I can't recommend it, didn't grab me, didn't make me want to do another mission.			",109,4,0,3,3,0,0

												I like that this game seems like something new or at least unusual for what pople are playing lately. Unfortunately this game is so horrifically unpolished that its hard to play at times. Objectives are totally unclear, escort missions ocassionally impossible and require setting the difficulty and auto aim to easiest levels (as someone who plays games on hard the game is flawed, not difficult) and the graphics are not just old, they're in the way of what might be fun. I got as far as navigating a pitch black maze versus one hit kill lasers and gave up. The only way to see is fire your gun and watch the rounds hit the walls. Rather than exasperate myself further I'll end it, watch the ending on youtube and play something worth my time.As for the story, it is long and complex. I watched and listened to every cutscene and every bit of dialog. I was bored the whole time. At least Aquanox 1 was functional with less impossible missions and game halting problems.No crashes that I can remember. Maybe rarely. For that I am appreciative.			",280,76,11,25,20,4,43
