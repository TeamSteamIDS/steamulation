												In my opinion, this is one of the greatest multiplayer tactical FPS titles on PC. I use this game as my point of reference when comparing with newer tactical FPS titles.PROS :- Huge arsenal of weapons and gadgets- Large selection of maps containing varied environments- Great gameplay with tight gun control, multiple stances (including a unique ""fluid"" leaning system) and good damage modeling- The graphics still hold up to this day, and you can run it on just about any rig configuration- Immersive sound effects (authentic gun sounds, enemy chatter, ambient noises, player character movement sounds, etc.)- Complete multiplayer suite featuring customizable game settings- Unpredictable AI that will flank, patrol and call for backup- You can still find several populated servers online, and the modding scene is still activeCONS :- Requires a ubi.com account to access multiplayer functionality- Can be brutally difficult at times due to the aforementioned unpredictable AI- Lacks in-game VOIP			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear potential player or veteran R6:3 player:Here is a new way to play Terrorist Hunt mode, in case you get bored. Step 1: Take your team to your favorite room or area of the map, and take cover.Step 2: Are you ready? Good. Now press ~ to open the console, and type 'callterro'. Step 3: Smile. Every terrorist on the map is now rushing to your location :D Step 4: Don't die. Note: Not all terrorists come out of the woodwork. You might have to go out and hunt down the last couple. This doesn't work so well (at all) on the shipyard map for some reason. All in all, some maps work better than others with this little experiment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright let me be real clear and real honest right here right now for you potential buyers, you don't deserve to buy this game. That's right, you don't DESERVE to buy it. You are laying your eyes upon history, one of the greatest creations of mankind. A testament to the fire that once burned in the hearts of developers that has since long been extinguished.  What is Rainbow Six 3? Who is Rainbow Six 3? I ask you today, who are you?What is the purpose of this game? What is the purpose of life? Food? Water? What does it all mean. It means nothing, absolutely nothing when compared to this virtual battlefield called Rainbow Six 3 Gold Edition. This game, is life. It is the judge, the teacher, the principle, the homeless man, the DMV, the doctor, it is all in one, ever so beautiful. But yea this is a badass game, one of the best man. I’m telling you boy, you best pick it up right now it’s so good. MAN I’m going to go play now! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you love this game, but have windows 10... Just follow these steps:Fixed created by: ♥♥♥♥_AStutter Fix1)Disable Raven Shield VSYNC2)Run the game with one coreI know that those solutions have already been posted, but I realized that you have to do BOTH of them for the game to actually always work.So here is detailed info on how to do those 2 things:1)Go to your RavenShield/System/ folder and open ravenshield.iniSearch for the vsync in the text file, and you will find an entry ""UseVSync=True"". Change it to ""UseVSync=False"". (Use ctrl+F to found UseVSync(...). Save and close the file.Go to your ATI/NVIDIA Control Panel and make sure that the vertical synchronization or vertical refresh is to the option OFF or Application Specific.That's the first part of fixing it.2)You can do it with 2 ways:Either disable one core by Alt-Tabbing out when the game is open, going to the Task Manager, going to the Processes, right-clicking to the ravenshield.exe from the list and selecting ""set affinty"", and deselecting CPU 0.or the recommended way so you don't have to do this each time you start the game:Go to your raven shield folder (not the system), and create a text file there. Open with notepad and paste this:cd systemstart /affinity 01 ravenshield.exeand save the file as ""fixedstart.bat"" or whatever .batNow by double clicking on this file will start the game single-core. You can create a shortcut for this to your desktop for easy launching. OBS: Sometimes the game will bug your mouse, just restart the game or your computer.OBS 2: If you are a little boring to found all enemies, press ' (the buttom bellow the ESC) and write ""route""god - makes you invencibleghost - you can flywalk - disable flight modegodhostage 1 - invencibility for hostagesgodteam - you team never diesneutralizeterro - neutralize all terroristsrescuehostage - rescue all hostages (obviously)disarmbombs - disarme all bombstsurrender - all terrorists surrender on sightfullammo - gaves you full ammo (obviously again)Have fun!

												Don't be fooled by my steam playtime, I have much longer logged on my boxed copy and still play to this day. It's a game I enjoy so much I bough a steam copy just for backup purposes.  The end of an era, it marks the last great tactical shooter on the market before this series descended into mediocrity. Nothing else since this has come close to equalling its quality of brutal, unforgiving tactics. This is a game that wears its realism on its sleeve and isn't afraid to let you drop dead from one bullet fired from a guy you couldn't even have seen coming. You move slowly and even walking throws your aim way off. Repeated autofire might as well be fired with your eyes closed. Guns feel weighty and impactful, dropping enemies in one or two torso shots.  It's harsh and doesn't feel remotely fair at times, but having smooth, flawless success in this game is more satisfying than any other shooter I've played. Unlocking all the maps requires playing through the campaign mode, where the iffy team AI and permanent injuries/death to the squad members can make things frustrating, but if you take the time to plan things out they usually go well. The game has no tolerance for the slightest mistake, for even a single corner left unchecked, and requires awareness and caution you rarely need in other games. The real fun comes with friends. Competitive modes are fine, but nothing's better than the sheer teamwork it takes to clear out a whole map in co-op. And the sheer disaster that can strike if any one of you slips up for a moment. Multiplayer no longer functions out of the box, so you'll have to take alternate methods to get it work, such as Hamachi or Tunngle, but it's well worth the effort. Still one of my favourite coop games of all time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Realistic and fun!+ graphics still look good- HUD and scope stretch on anything not 4:3!- no aiming down iron sights (Project VI is unreleased, RavenShield 2.0 is not animated))- things can clip through walls (bodies, smoke...)+ AI is good (spawns somewhat randomly, uses grenades, kills hostages, surrenders, moves around)- AI threats give themselves away by talking/shouting whenever they detect enemies- does not react to smoke grenades (could shoot into the smoke randomly or alert the others)- shoots towards dead player until empty; sometimes spawns in sight and shoots- friendly AI never uses single shot+ missions are challenging+ singleplayer mission planning is cool- but tedious, AI operatives expose themselves while opening doors, throwing grenades+ campaign has a storyline- if not okay with some operatives' deaths you will try again and again and again+ gun porn (models, animations, sounds, variation, customisation)+ realistic reloading: keeping track of each magazine, reloading the one with the next most bullets in, discarding only empty ones (no magical top-ups)+ good sound, music, voice acting+ realistic stances, movement (slow strafe and backwards, fluid posture, fluid door opening), weapon handling (big spread while moving)- no freelook or freeaim or breathing- while leaning in fluid posture, there is gun collision, which can get you killed as usually there isn't any+ ragdoll physics are realistic and funny+ online multiplayer still works- people mostly run & gun- no voice comm in game- drawing tool only shows the top layer of the map+ easy to make custom maps, huge variety high quality community-made maps available (credit to HeavyMetal)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rainbow Six: Raven Shield is still one of Tom Clancy's best first-person shooters to date. The game was released over a decade ago and it still has one of the highest replay values of any Rainbow Six game. The highly customizable mission planning makes your approach to a mission entirely up to you. Go stealth, assualt or a little bit of both. A must buy for any Tom Clancy Rainbow Six fan!

												Well, I've been playing this game for about 7 years and you know what? That was the greatest time I had in my game-playing career. The emotions i've experienced were quite similar to The Last Of Us, no kidding. I love Tom Clancy for developing Rainbow Six, absolutely He is in Heaven right now, God bless him. This game is the greatest tactical shooter of all times. It's hard, it's tough, it's simply amazing. I remember those days when I was sitting at home in long winter nights planning and making awesome tactics to complete missions. 2 hours of planning, 15 minutes of gaming. But it was great. Try it, you won't regret. I promise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was the peak of Ubisoft's Rainbow Six franchise. Here is why;-Realistic AI. The enemy AI will execute hostages if they see the player, run if they are outnumbered, and even surrender to trick the player into letting your guard down, so that their friend can shoot the player in the back! -Lots of weapons, gear, and customisability. One can customise not only their own soldier's weapons, gear, and armour, but their teammates as well. -Planning. The game allows the player to set waypoints for their team and AI teams, and the AI teams will automattically follow. One can even set ""Go codes"" to make the AI wait for the code to begin an action, such as breaching. -The multiplayer still works. One can set up their own dedicated server in a few simple steps. See my discussion post for help. -Lots of fun game modes and maps. This game has many fun game modes, such as Lone Wolf (terrorist hunt alone); Terrorist Hunt (kill all the terrorists); and Hostage Rescue (self-explanatory). It also features classic maps such as Peak, Presidio and Prison. -Fairly good graphics. While these graphics aren't amazing, they still hold up well today. -Non-linear maps. Play your way. So, if you have played Rainbow Six Vegas 1 or 2, come see what the classic games were like! If you've never played Rainbow Six before, now is a great time to start! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First, ignore my measly few hours playtime... I owned this game on dvd a loooong time ago...Secondly: NO uplay... I hate uplay. This does not have uplay. This makes me happy.It's not often you'll see me recommending a Ubisoft game, but this is literally Gold. This was a Tom Clancy game that actually deserved the name, back when TC had some say in the development of games bearing his name (before Ubi bought the rights to use his name on any old arcade trash). Easiliy my favorite Rainbow Six game and I've played them all (except Siege)... Picked it up again for old times sake. Sure it's old, it looks dated, but it's challenging and fun... It has widescreen support. The Ravenshield 2.0 mod improve the look of it a lot (if you're anything like me you'll probably want to remove the gas mask view from the hud). With the Ravenshield 2 mod the game is even better than I remember...


Not too shabby for a game released over a dozen years agoo...

												Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3 Gold by Tom Clancy is a third game in Tom Clancy's Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six franchise. Which was realistical tactical shooter, where you would create your own plan for the level and then execute it, being excited to see how your dumb AI teammates will get slaughtered this time. And yes, it uses ""one shot, one kill"" system, almost. Released in in 2003 by Red Storm and Ubisoft, it also had console ports for Xbox, PS2 and Gamecube. Consoles ports were different: no planning, you command only one 4-man squad and each got few hitpoints.This is Gold, meaning that it comes with inclusion of original Raven Shield game and the first expansion pack - Athena Sword, that mostly adds few more levels, released in 2004.There also was a second expansion pack, which was almost finished (probably meaning that it just didn't go through debugging), Iron Wrath. It was released for free in 2005 on Internet anyway. Meaning that people were happy, aside from 56kb modem users. So, technical stuff. While main menu and planning phase work at 4:3 resolution, gameplay itself supports widescreen resolution. But it doesn't change FOV, so you will be seeing chubby people. But it crashes sometimes when you change between planning phase and execution phase. So always save your plans!Expansion packs are a bit weird in that they will not play their new sounds, that are briefing voice acting and new sounds for new weapons. To fix that, you will have to go to mods folder, find folder of needed expansion pack, and then copy ""Sounds"" folder from there to the root directory of the game.You also will have problems installing free Iron Wrath, as installer will not recognise Rainbow Six for what it is. To fix that just check Steam Guides. In nutshell, you will have to create new key in Registry where retail version of a game keeps all the needed info about itself. You don't have to screw the system itself, don't worry.As for multiplayer, well, you could play in either coop or competive. It used old Ubi service, but as of now, multiplayer is technically dead. I heard that at some point you was required to use UPlay account instead, but it didn't work for me.EDIT: Because turns out that my actual login, that is email, is way too long for the game. HA!In this game you play as anybody of Rainbow Six squad, the point of which is to make terrorist think that they are dealing with six pony-loving hippies, only to be met with eight aim-botting hard-try top operatives. But because it's a top secret squad and it's actions are written off as actions of special forces of whatever country they are in, the shock tactic of the name just never works. Just use flashbangs for that.Well, in this part you are dealing with neo-nazi terrorists who love taking hostages, listen to briefing and watch occasional cutscenes that make you feel good and even heroic for a job well done. Which is nice. It has ending video, so that's enough.Another thing to note is that Rainbow Six is full of only top-top-top people, only the best individuals from separate parts of world. And then, after collecting them all, no one bothered to teach them how to work as a team. The only thing they ever learned is that they are supposed to walk in a line. And even then it can go wrong in small hallways, where a leader of a line will turn around and start pushing the tail out, as it refused to turn around, until his heavily armored butt slides out from the doorway and gets filled with bullets, while you scream at the screen in observation mode. Good bullets. Shiny, sturdy, can survive from -50 to +50 degrees of temperature. Must be 7.62x39mm ones. A bit outdated, but good bullets indeed, tactical-realism fans approve.No, really, I got to see that few times.But really, AI in single-player game can do a lot of things to sabotage the fact that game relies on squad-based tactics.And well, let's say that Rainbow Six 3 isn't as best ever as fans tend to call it.Or at least it didn't age well.And when I say ""didn't age well"", what I mean is ""SWAT 4 came out"". Which was not only more tactical, but implented proper AI teammates. No planning phase though.At least graphics and music in this game are still nice. Even got ambient music sometimes playing during mission and such. And ragdolls look funny nowdays, just crashing onto floor. Blam.Anyway, since fans of tactical-realistical games always brag about such games and on question ""what is tactical exactly?"" they answer only ""ummmm... you are too stupid to get"", here is what you get to expect: Abuse leaning around corners when you are controlling a soldier; Abuse the aimbotness of AI teammates and place them in such way that no one walks behind them; Throw smoke grenade to become invinsible for AI; Try to come into difficult room from few directions with different teams. Those four rules is what makes this game. And planning.You get into mission and first thing you get is briefing. After that, you are going to set up a plan. And oh boy, that's the main feature of the early games of franchise, as you get to put waypoints for up to three teams. You can also coordinate them together by setting go-codes. Tell them to throw grenade or breach the door. Actually, you can either try to beat level with no plan like generic realistical shooter, use pre-made one, use pre-made one and edit if neccersary or just make up a whole new one. And it's just awesome that you can make the map play out the way you want. Until you will find out that AI can't open door slightly and throw grenade in, like players. Or bounce grenade at the wall, limiting the usage of flashbang. Or that they have tendency to never stop at waypoints and fire full-automatic while walking. Or that they will never decide to wait for enemy come out if they hear ""huh, that's strange"". Or the way you can't order them to throw smoke grenade down the tunnel in the third mission, so it's only up to player. Or just find out that some tasks AI does really badly.In other words, while it DOES require tactical planning, but for dumb AI. Through trial-and-error of execution you will find what AI does best and judging by this you will build your plan for dummies. Which takes away some enjoyment.If you try to pull something clever in this, you will have to do dirty job with your own hands. And even if you build a good plan, there is a bit of randomness on placement of some terrorists, so it can sometimes go wrong anyway.After that, you set up a squad, pulling 8 members for a job and separating them into teams. While wondering what's the point of Demos, who just make some objectives complete few seconds faster, and recons types. After that you look at huge list of samey weapons that you don't care about, pick the strongest/favourite assault rifle and put silencer onto it, as there is no real tactical choice. Unless sniper rifle. Then you look over some more useless devices, including multiplayer-only, which are in campaign for some reason, or like tear gas grenade and gas mask.Then you start execution and watch the new way your team getting slaugthered in some wacky way on the first minute, then beat remaining mission as a lone wounded machine gunner, slumbering with broken legs and getting through by abusing leaning, which is how I did pre-last mission. Actually, that was slightly fun. But only for once.But really, the main reason to recommend it is the lack of alternatives. No other tactical FPS outside of Rainbow Six has detailed planning, as far as I am aware! So it's sad that Ubisoft wasted this part. New R6 games are still nice, but should have kept feature that was making franchise unique.Not as sad as lack of SWAT4 on Steam though.And for epic main theme that overloads nostalgia.

												I bought this game for my collection during the UBIsoft sale, just because I remember playing it as a kid. So I decided to refresh my memory.Why aren't there people who make games like this anymore? Rainbow Six is as fun as it used to be years ago and plays so much differently from all this casual action games of modern times. Its old, but not in the bad meaning of old, it is classic, oldschool if you please :D. There is a lot of replayability as well: you can follow premade plan, just rush it as lone wolf or with the team, make up your own strategy for the map and even spectate everything while your team just follows orders.But who am I telling it to, I doubt that anyone who never heard about these series before will ever read this review of my. If you are considering buying: don't hesitate. Rainbow Six 3 is truly the Gold of game industry.And best part is that it supports modern resolutions just fine (well except of tiny little main menu, but whatever.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the bee's knees m8. The last and best Rainbow Six Installment from back when it was still a tactical shooter and not some overrated watered down gears of duty knock off. This game will test your mettle son. It has all the things that made it's predecessors great, with some aspects improved and some neat added features like a fluid leaning system for peeking round corners and In-Game orders to relay to your team. Lots of different operatives, weapons and gear to choose from, non-linear maps and planning phase all mean a variety of different gaming experiences and gameplay styles on each map. Only problem I have with it is that the teammate AI can be really stupid sometimes as they prioritize waypoints over covering sightlines, which can suck if you are trying to go for a no-death run for campaign on elite difficulty because your m80s will buy it like a Steam summer sale. That said though it's a gr8 game, still holds up today despite being over a decade old. Tango down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. This game was one of my very first gaming experiences. Before Neopets. Before Pokemon. Before my PS1 and Xbox. Before Warcraft 3 and Diablo and all the other good stuff. I used to play this all the time with my dad, and as such constitutes some of my fondest childhood memories.Anyway, let's dive right in.This game has technical issues. The menus are locked to 800x600 (?) resolution, though the game itself supports much higher resolutions. It did 1080p just fine for me. However, due to the different resolutions, your resolution will fluctuate whenever you enter/leave the menus. Kind of annoying, but no big deal. You better get used to the low resolution though, because you'll be spending a lot of time in the planning menu. Which brings me to my next point...This is not your typical action FPS. It's relatively slow paced and you spend a lot of time planning things out. There are 3 teams you can customize. You can outfit each team member with different armor, weapons, weapon attachments, various types of grenades, and various utility tools. During planning you can dictate where your teams go, how they go there, what they do when the reach there, etc.For example, you might want green and gold team to wait for your signal (""Alpha, go!"") before they clear a particular room. - Want one team to throw a smoke and the other to throw a flashbang before doing storming the room? Done. - Locked door? No problem, tell them to breach it first.- Hostages? Throw some tear gas in. Don't worry, you can outfit your guys with gas masks.There is a ton of ways to complete missions. You can take control of a team as well, and co-ordinate with the other teams in clearing a level. AI sometimes spotty. On occasions the AI will get stuck bumping into one another, or they'll be looking in stupid directions while taking fire. Most of the time though the AI is quite capable. You'll see your teams moving in formation, covering for one another. They'll strafe into rooms. I've actually been saved by my AI companion more times than I can count, so they're certainly not a burden.There is auto-aim, but you can turn it off. You can also configure how sensitive you want the auto-aim to be.There is a lot of trial and error. Your plans will not work on the first try. You'll be going through the level halfway when one of your teams starts getting killed off. Then you'll go back to the planning stage and try to rectify the flaws in your master plan. Maybe green team should throw a smoke before storming this particular room. Maybe you should reposition gold team so that they can better cover fire for green team. This is as much a strategy game as it is an action one.Another this is that death is permanent. You have a roster of soldiers, and if they die during a mission, they will not be available for subsequent missions. This gives you an incentive to complete missions with minimum casualties. Soldiers can be wounded too, making them move slower and have slower reflexes. Wounded soldiers recover after a couple missions.This game is fantastic, but it's not for everyone. It can't really be compared to anything else on the market. Unfortunately the Rainbow Six series is no longer the tactical shooter it once was.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3 is, for my opinion, the best game in Tom Clancy's Games series.The plot in the game is really simple: some bad guys want to rule the world and we must stop them.But the story isn't important in tactical FPS. The main thing is gameplay. And gameplay is really great.At the beginning of every mission, we have briefing. In the briefing we'll know our objectives, how many terrorists on the level and other information. Then we should choose who will go on the mission. There are more than 50 persons in the game. We can choose evryone from the beginning, we mustn't unlock them during the game. Then we equip our operatives.We change their uniform, weapons, gadgets and others. After equipping our team, we should have a plan. This is the most interesting thing in the game. We make checkpoints to our team. Our team will go to these checkpoints. Also we can point, where should operatives throw grenade, or where should they wait another team.After we are ready, we are going to the ""battlefield"". We can control EVERYONE in our teams. Usually on missions there are 2 or 3 teams. Usually you should kill all terrorists or rescue all hostages. Sometimes you should deactivate the bomb or  plant bugs in the computers. Terrorist die from 1 or 2 shots. But you also die from 1 or 2 shots, so this game is hard.The graphics are still good for our days. Yeah, not Crysis, but Raven Shield is from 2003! The controls in game are not comfortable, because there are a lot of options: open doors silently, order your teammates, change operative and etc.Also there is cool multiplayer. There is not a lot of players, but it is not hard to find them. Usually on servers you should eliminate all terrorists. Also in Gold Edition includes Athena Sword, short campaign with new objectives, operatives and new missions with time limit.This game is very cool, the best tactical FPS of all times. People who love such kind of games will love it. Other players should also try this game. And it's cheap - $5.99!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Athena's Sword was the last of the good Rainbow six games.  This game requires planning and strategy.  It is very realistic for a game.  Reasons that this game is better than the other Rainbow Six Games:-Enemies go down in 1 or 2 hits and so do you.  Spotting and shooting the enemy first is a must.  Just because you or an enemy is down does not mean that they are dead.  Use the heart beat detector to see if someone is just down for the level or actually dead.  -You will spend a great deal of time planning and preparing.  You cannot win by superior reflexes alone.  -You cannot recover health on a mission.  Not even the world's best surgeon can make you as good as new a few minutes after being shot in the chest.  Hint, do not get shot.-When someone dies they die.  Even just being immobilized from injuries will cause someone to be unusable for the rest of the campaign.  Unlike many other games where you will be take an RPG to the face and when the fighting stops get right back up again like that was just a scratch.  -The computer AI is much better than the previous Rainbow Six games (especially friendly AI).  In an earlier Rainbow Six game I once sent a team of eight people to attack the enemy and they could not figure out how to open the first door.  Eventually the enemy became bored and opened the door where he casually shot and killed all eight members on my team.  No one on my team even fired a shot.  The AI in this game does not even have to be given orders.  They know to shoot bad guys and to defuse bombs that they pass.  -One of the worst things about the previous Rainbow six games was the stealth missions.  There is only one stealth mission in this game and it is actually beatable without having to try over and over again until the enemy moves in just the way you need them to and without having to use cheat codes.  Rainbow Six... You will be missed.Strategy:-Use the camouflage type that the computer picks for you in the planning phase-Put silencers on all of your weapons-Stay crouched down-If you do those things you will almost always get the jump on the enemy even if you just threw a flashbang in the next room (missing realism here).   -The best all-around weapon is the Galil.  -All you really need is flashbangs and breach charges except for the stealth mission where you will need a heartbeat monitor.-On hostage rescue only missions always look for the quickest route to the hostages and do not spend any time exploring.  -Always wear heavy armor except on the stealth mission.  Bugs:-On the first airport level your team will lose their path finding ability if they go out on the balcony and they will be stuck there until the level is over.  -Playing the game on Windows 10 is difficult because there is some setup work you have to do.  You must play in windowed mode, which means setting up the config files to run the game in the same resolution as your monitor so that it is full screened and windowed mode.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With the incredibly fast AI and limited team members, this game requires you to be careful. Grenades should be used more frequently in single player than you'd expect, trust me. This is the only game that I literally have no complaints about. Do I recommend it? Hell yeah!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was and is the pinnacle of tactical shooters, it was a serious improvement on the already amazing original Rainbow Six games and it was the last installment of the Rainbow Six series that kept the spirit of the original. Though I did enjoy them, The Rainbow Six Vegas games were a little watered down to cater to the casual gamer compared to Raven Shield and Athena Sword. In fact, I believe this was the last decent and truely ""realistic"" tactical FPS. There are tons of maps in this game that allow for play styles varying from precise, patient and meticulously planned long range engagements to savage, fast paced and adrenaline fueled Close Quarters Battle. There is a massive selection of weapons, attachments, class specific items and even ammunition types allowing the player to tailor their kit to their play style. The armory is bigger than any game that I can think of. Because of this, the replayability of this game is endless. While it continues to be surprisingly entertaining for a game released in 2003, it is beginning to show it's age and lacks some of the innovative features seen in modern games. The player cannot look down the iron sights of the weapons. Unless optics are mounted on the weapon, the right mouse button only causes a zoom effect. Also the graphics are a bit obsolete. The installation of the Ravenshield 2.0 mod fixes this, however, by improving textures and adding many of the features (including iron sights) that we as gamers have become accustomed to in the last decade. To summarize, if you haven't played this game and you crave a challenging, thinking man's tactical shooter over the mindless run and gun FPS' you get these days you need this in your Steam library. If I can play this game consistently for over a decade without it getting old, I'm pretty sure you can get at least 100 hours out of it. Do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this one, you won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm coming to this game with no nostalgia in the slightest. In fact, when this game was released I was little more than a toddler. That said...This game is great. I picked it up for just over a pound on sale and expected an hour or so of fun before it got boring. I was more than wrong. This is extremely different from the modern RS games and one I really recommend to any fan of tactical shooters. You can deploy up to 3 squads on a mission (of up to a total of 8 men throughout all 3 squads) and their gear can be customised to the T. You begin by carefully planning the actions of each squad via plotting waypoints with commands on a map; and while this isn't as detailed as it could be (you can't control the direction your squad is looking, for example) it's more than satisfactory.After planning, you enter an FPS ""action phase"". You can play either as a commander of one of your squads or simply spectate and issue orders on a radio. Either way, it makes for some very tense situations as you struggle to keep everyone alive. This tension is made greater by the fact that dead squadmates stay dead throughout the remainder of the campaign.So, overall, I definitely recommend this game. Especially for such a low price as £3.49.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very complex, unforgiving tactical shooter.  You'll end up spending more time planning certain missions than playing them, because you can't afford to make one mistake.  They don't make them like this anymore, this is still one of the best tactical shooters around.  Get it along with this mod.http://www.moddb.com/mods/raven-shield-two-point-zeroSeriously, shooters like this no longer exist, and it's a shame.  Even SWAT 4 is closer to Rainbow Six: Vegas and Siege than this one.  The command system is beyond most other shooters.  It reminds me of XCOM but in FPS form factor.  No stupid story tacked on, just difficult scenarios that you must overcome using smart tactics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The last real Rainbow Six game. I'm not saying this due to opinion. The name 'Rainbow Six', in the Tom Clancy universe, refers to the leader of the multi-national counter-terrorism SOF 'Rainbow'. In every Rainbow Six up to this one (original, Rogue Spear, Covert Ops), you take that role; assigning team members to squads, choosing each member's loadout, creating a plan for each team to carry out during the course of each mission. Then you can either spectate or take control of one of the teams. You really can't even compare or argue the Rainbow Six games that came out after this because they are basically a different genre with different fans.Post-Rainbow Six 3 (Lockdown, Vegas, Vegas 2, etc.) you only take control of a single protaganist throughout the entire game. You can't plan out the mission because the missions are linear and setpiece-focused, much like traditional FPS games. Your health regenerates in later games, and they have no wounding system. And while the Vegas games were still fun and you were still a member of Rainbow, you did not assume the position of the commander, Rainbow Six, in these games. And unfortunately, no big-name developer has made a game simliar to the old school Rainbow Six games in well over a decade.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still a great and real tense tactical shooter. The missions are quite varied even if a few of them appear more than once. Smoke grenades are a little overpowered and some elements feel a little dated but the game is still definitely a challenge, particularly if you want to keep your guys alive to the end.Being an old game has meant Ubisoft has closed the online element down now, but there are ways round that to keep playing witih any friends who want a cooperative game.Overall this has a great balance between difficult but not frustrating. Very good for £5, but often it drops in a the sales to less. Then it becomes an absolute steal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I personally have been playing the R6 Vegas series for a very long time and have enjoyed it to this dayAlthough i have played the old Rainbow Six Games before but not much. Only have played Rogue SpearWhat do i think of this game ? Well, coming from a person who have been playing Spunkgargleweewee, i really enjoyRainbow Six 3 Raven ShieldI would say it's an almost perfect sequel to the 2 older games, Rogue Spear and the original Rainbow Six.Having better graphics and surprisingly, first person view models. Texture is better, character models are well detailedGameplay-wise, it's still the same old Rainbow Six game; Slow-paced, u die very easily and u only get one chance.The game is pretty fun and frustrating at the same time coz u'll never know what is gonna come up next. Clearing rooms, wide areas, u wont know whether u'll die or not and that's the point of being tactical. Cover the corners, make sure that the room is clear, using different grenades to ur advantage.In conclusion, if u're a fan of Rainbow Six, this is the last Rainbow Six game right before the Vegas series to stand true to the old Rainbow Six vibe. I recommend u to pick it up and just play it. Although the online experience is pretty dead but there are a few servers that has players in them.If u're NOT a fan of Rainbow Six, it is ur choice. Whether u like slow-paced shooters or not, i highly recommend it.I'd give this game an 8/10. Thank u for reading :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the Dark Souls of tactical shooters.This game is an advanced, complicated, tactical shooter. In order to win, you'll need to order your men with the right amount of commands executed at the right times with the right equipment. You cannot go in and run and gun everyone. There are heavy consequences for your actions as there is permadeath for your characters. You can die in 1-2 shots. Because of these factors, you have to take it very slowly and carefully.You'll spend 30 minutes planning out your mission in the mission screen, and you'll constantly restart your mission, over and over again just so you can have a death-less run.Or you can be like me and accept permanent death and rush the game (recommended).This game was ahead of its time before they streamlined many of the modern games you see today. They don't make games like this anymore. Still, the challenge is worth the fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I passed the whole game in 11.7h of playthrough.I will do some pros and cons for the gamePROS(Raven Shield)-The game graphics are pretty decent comparing the game to other games from '03-The game mechanics are almost the same as for older Ghost Recon games but it's somehow played faster then the Ghost Recons-The game is realistic, 1 shot you're wounded, 2 shots you're probably dead-You can commandeer up to 3 teams(including your own team). Red team, Green team and Gold team-No bugs or crashes-The game is forgotten but it doesn't need any updates or patches-The game is 15 Missions long. Not too long, not too short if you ask me-Community isn't deadCONS(Raven Shield)-I don't know where to find Multiplayer games(but I have never tried to find them)-You can't jump in the gamePROS(Athena Sword)-The game graphics are pretty decent comparing the game to other games from '04-The game mechanics are almost the same as for older Ghost Recon games but it's somehow played faster then the Ghost Recons-The game is realistic, 1 shot you're wounded, 2 shots you're probably dead-You can commandeer up to 3 teams(including your own team).

												Pros:- Graphics still hold up to this day!- OUTSTANDING sound, especially with a headset. Each shot is not a toy, but a terrifying panic-enducing alarm which you must keep a level head through to survive.- Damage makes sense - shot with a 9 mil? Are you wearing armor thick enough to stop it from killing you? Your leg is injured, you are limping and bleeding in pain. That shotgun is too close, there is no surviving that.- Monumental gameplay mechanics (described in my rant below)- SO MANY MODS! Cons:- No online servers left alive (aside from 4 or 5 hard-to-find custom servers)- AI is overpowered in some moments and stupid in othersTom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3 - were to start? I have infinite praise for this game.This game is undeniably aged, but the gameplay mechanics still remain a pillar of tactical shooters to this day. Whether you go on a mission with a team of expert counter-terorist operatives, or you head into a mission lone-wolf, alertness and strategy is key to success - your life, your team's lives and the lives of helpless hostages all depend on your execution, which cannot be anything less than perfect.  Before each mission you may chose from a range of multi-national Rainbow Operatives to accompany you on a mission. Each operative has his/her specialty - be it alertness, stealth, leadership or skills with various equipment from breaching charges to sniper support to clearing rooms in close-quarters combat. It is up to you to decide each member's loadout (primary, secondary, type of ammunition, accessories, armor type, etc.,) You may chose to go in with a single squad or split up into 3 separate squads. Then comes the fun part - mission planning: drawing up a master plan takes time and dedication to carrying out a successful mission with zero casualties. Doing so you can rely on your fellow squad members to carry out your plans perfectly automatically - while you are sweeping the basement another squad that you assembled will sweep the roof for you, according to plan. But beware, everything relies on perfection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you want a tactical shooter that's not all about running and gunning? And some Hollywood crappy shooter that lazy for nothing* game-developers made? Then this game is meant for you, hell ""Siege,"" isn't even as good as this original and many other ""Tom Clancy"" games. 10/10 better than ""Siege."" also has a way much better soundtrack and theme song!

												Used to play this over ten years ago.. been looking for a decent tactical shooter. and come across good old ravenshieldother than the graphics looking dated.. a few issues with it playing on Win 10 and installing a patch to play multiplayer..it is still awesome! I forgot just how tense and exciting this game can be!  I forgot about the replayability to this game.. the different ways you can attack the maps, sending your teams to breach and clear... controlling all your players & setting way points and orders..and if your not feeling like a tactician, lone wolf or a 2-3 man squad.  having to peak and lean every corner.. and having to think how to clear each room or area the best ways possible or end up insta killed is adrenaline fueled!pros-best tactical shooter you will come across-tons of community maps.. -theres still a small online community! 13 years! -AI is better than most games in 2016 (they can be super silly at times still, which makes it halirious when they do)cons- Hates windows 8/10 (nothing too bad, easy fixes)- if you've never played tactical shooters like the arma series or other rainbow six games.. your in for a shock with the difficulty- will cause stress, jumpiness & insomia10/10  age old classic.. -			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Last decent Tom Clancy Title. This game was the absolute apex of brilliance when it came out. I remember taking the journey to GAME in Wimbledon with my mate to buy it the day it came out. My PC simply wouldn't run it at the time, so we took turns in having a life each. on his PC. We both digested the manual on the train back to his house and both watched the progress bar patiently as it installed from DVD.Little did we know at the time that this game would form such a grip on our gaming lives and produce so many amazing nights of pure strategic fun and frustration. One fond memory was on Airport we hunted down the last Tango. Me and a mate we both stacked up on separate doors, in the upstairs above the hangar. He flashed and I ran in with pistol, we both dropped the tango on entry with syncronised double taps. Was perfect and still comes up in conversation when we meet for a beer to this day.The beauty of this game for me was the amount of firearms available, the MP5 A4 was amongst, and still is my favourite. You can run with it and fire in burst or full auto and still hit your target. Weapons ranging from SMG through to sniper rifles can be deployed on any mission. Flash bangs, smoke greanades, tear gas (don’t forget your mask), Breaching charges etc. A plethora of pistols and with differing calibers and even the ability to switch the ammunition type, FMJ or HP. Such a nice level of detail even down to armour loadouts heavy for protection light for speed low drag set ups.It is a little dated by todays standards both graphically and in terms of movement but the core game mechanics and play is still great with a bunch of your mates on comms. Still some really nice touches in there for such an ageing title. The ability to open doors bit by bit so you can drop a flash in the close it then open it when the bang detonates is amazing.You can still play the game via the in game browser, limited severs but still some hardcore players still linger, after all these years. I can’t even remember how many times I have come back to this game despite it’s glory days behind me. I tried to play vegas 2, it is a little dumbed down but has some nice features and it was a great game but the sound loop bug was never fixed an persisted to haunt me playing MP. So I couldn’t play it online with mates.So I bough the gold edition so I had a copy on steam (hence the hours recorded are few compared to the actual blood sweat and tears that have gone into it on the DVD version), I still have Raveshield and Athena sword on disk, though this gold ediiton doesn't have Ironwraith that came out. Not sure if you can get htis now. Which is a shame, no doubt you can find a Website somewhere for a forum of die hard players will have it or modded it.A truly epic game worth owning even just for posterity.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Possibly the best Rainbow Six game ever devloped. Raven Shield and its subsequent expansion marked the final outing of tactical plan making and multiple team tactical play before Rainbow Six: Vegas moved the series towards a watered down, albeit enjoyable, tactical experience. The only downside to this title is the AI, both friendly and enemy, which can be buggy. Multiplayer is really where this game shines and although in coop mode you will have to put up with the sloppy enemy AI it's still a great experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a veteran of the Rainbow Six Games, going back to the first of the series. Been playing them for years and I honestly gotta say ""This is the best Tom Clancy game period!""This game is Punishing, Realistic, and definitley doesn't hold your hand. Runs well on modern rigs (I'm playing Windows10 1366x768)Crack a door and throw a flashbang in, stunning the confused tangos within. You lean in and take down the first tango, while the second is still stunned. You lean out of the way and your buddy takes out the second.

												I remember this being my favorite Rainbow Six, so I picked it up.I was afraid that it might not hold up, but you know what? It's better than I remembered it being.It is unfortunately somewhat dated and the mission planner is a bit wonky and could have used a little more options, which kinda sucks because it turns you off from ever using it even though it's sometimes essential.Still despite its problems which could be fixed if they released a new one with better technology, it's pretty fantastic.And hey! It's damn cheap for such a quality game.Man, I wish Ubisoft would release a proper Rainbow Six sequel again...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've come around to this game after a few false starts. I definitely recommend getting the 2.0 mod for this game, as it's a vatst improvement over the original layout. On to the game: I'm sure you've heard this game takes place in two parts - planning and action. Both are incredibly well done and are borderline simulation territory, but definitely still very gamey. The AI is pretty good, but not perfect. You can tell your squad to go clear a room and sometimes they will bunch in the doorway, ignoring terrorists. Another favorite is missions where enemies may not be armed, but are trying to complete some objective (like deleting data from computers). Many times, the AI would be told to clear a room and ignore these enemies, leading to a mission failure. For this reason, I feel there are a few missions that are just bugged and don't reflect the base game (namely mission 11, where it's unclear what is causing a mission failure, as all weapons were silenced and all enemies were killed upon entering a room). For missions like these, it's nice to have access to the developer console and just 'completemission.' This game is far from perfect, but it's really fun when everything comes together. The Gold Edition comes with the expansions, too, so you get a lot (around 30 missions?) for your money. SWAT 3 and 4 are still my favs, but this has an addicting element to it, as well.

												This is a stellar game for anyone with patience who wants a detailed tactical experience (in an FPS game). There are a wide variety of guns (including a really nice set of pistols) and all of the tactical planning you'd expect from a Rainbow Six game. One thing that I feel sets this game ahead of the other games is that you can even choose the type of ammo you use. It makes the game feel more satisfying when you realize you made all of the right choices in your planning. It is much more difficult than I remember though; it requires a bit of practice to get things right			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Edit: Changing formatting of list.This game is my ""Dark Souls"". It's infuriating, it has complex controls, enemies are super tough, and even with the tutorial you still don't know every aspect and you'll die a lot. But god do I love this game.NOTE: I played like, the first level of Athena Sword and that's it. All I've played so far (mostly) is Raven Shield, which is the base game. I also played it with a mod called Raven Shield 2.0 (which you can find on moddb). I HIGHLY reccommend it, as it improved almost every aspect of the game by adding weapons, camo, ironsights, and adds nice little tweaks.PROS:+ For a early 2000's game, the graphics are decent. Not fantastic, but you won't be looking at the game and throwing up.+ The environments are very well detailed. Even rooms that are out of the way with nobody in them are still lovingly put together. Except for a few reused missions near the end, there don't seem to be many glaringly reused assets, and as you go to different places around the world they defintely put care into making you feel like you were there.+ Good arsenal of weapons, although some are clearly not as good as others. You'll likely stick with the same few weapons for your team every time you play, but the choices are nice.+ Tight shooting. Each weapon handles fairly well and as with real life, burst fire and semi-auto will take enemies out way faster than spraying. Playing with the mod adds ironsights, but in vanilla there are none, making it more akin to Counter Strike in how you aim (although you can still zoom in slightly).+ Great tactics. Planning out your entry is always worth your time, and failing a mission can, yes, feel like utter BS, but then you can go back and study where you went wrong. You tweak your plan, change this and that, and when you're finished your plan goes smooth as butter. Even if you don't use the planning screen and go in blind (which I've done for a few), you still have a good repetoire of on-site tactics at your disposal. Order your team to burst in a door guns blazing, or maybe soften them with flashbangs, or you can tell them to go in on command so you can hurry over to a good vantage point to aid them from a flanking position. Basically, if you liked the quick tactics of R6 Vegas and Vegas 2, you'll catch on quick here.+ As always with the early R6 games, the music is fantastic. You'll get pumped up for sure.MEH:~ The story is ok. Nothing special, just enough to keep you going in one direction.~ Limited movement. In the early R6 games you could mantle and climb, but here you can't even go up a 2 foot platform without finding stairs. You get used to it, though.~ Your team AI can be a mixed bag. Most of the time they're great, and they'll spot and kill enemies you didn't notice, and they have far better reactions than you (obviously, since they're not human!). A few times, though, they can get a bit irritating. (Minor Spoilers ahead, although I'll try to stay vague). There's a point where you go to stop some chemical weapons, and enemies in hazmat suits are the ones that activate them if you're spotted. Unfortunately, those hazmat dudes are ""non combatants"" and thus your team members dont target them! I lost that mission so many times because my team wouldn't open fire on those enemies, simply because those enemies weren't a real ""threat"" to us!~ While it has been updated to modern resolution settings, the main menu is still locked at like, 800x600 or something.CONS:- Enemy AI can be a pain.

												While I do not have an abundance of hours clocked on this game, I did have the disc when it came out in 2003. Since then, I have played that thing to death: memorizing enemy locations, the stats of certain characters, and the best weapons combinations. Why? Because not only does this game have excellent gameplay, but no matter how many times you beat it, you can always find better ways to play, or cooler ways to succeed.The positive aspects of the game are inherent to the gameplay - being a tactical shooter, Rainbow Six 3 (Raven Shield) with its expansions let you use maps to guide ally movements and actions. An example: I know that there is a hostage at the room on the right above the stairs. I can map Green Team, the group I have equipped with heavy assault rifles, to breach the double doors in the center while Red Team, with their silenced weapons, push through the exit in the back, cutting them off quickly. This all happens while I send Gold team to snipe from the runway, ensuring no tangos get the jump on us. We go on the call ""Bravo.""It's the most fun I have had playing a Tom Clancy Game.The negatives come only with the age of the game. It was made in 2003, so the graphics, compared to today, are sub-par. That also means the the AI is a little slow and flawed. Sometimes terrorists can pinpoint your position and pull off a headshot without ever knowing you were there, and sometimes your allies will walk into a full warehouse of badies walking backwards, continuing the slaughter. This can be incredibly aggravating, but these occurences are few and far between.You have a lot of freedom with gun customization, especially for a game of this particular era, and a lot of freedom with how you plan and execute your missions.

												This is a stellar game for anyone with patience who wants a detailed tactical experience (in an FPS game). There are a wide variety of guns (including a really nice set of pistols) and all of the tactical planning you'd expect from a Rainbow Six game. One thing that I feel sets this game ahead of the other games is that you can even choose the type of ammo you use. It makes the game feel more satisfying when you realize you made all of the right choices in your planning. It is much more difficult than I remember though; it requires a bit of practice to get things right			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Edit: Changing formatting of list.This game is my ""Dark Souls"". It's infuriating, it has complex controls, enemies are super tough, and even with the tutorial you still don't know every aspect and you'll die a lot. But god do I love this game.NOTE: I played like, the first level of Athena Sword and that's it. All I've played so far (mostly) is Raven Shield, which is the base game. I also played it with a mod called Raven Shield 2.0 (which you can find on moddb). I HIGHLY reccommend it, as it improved almost every aspect of the game by adding weapons, camo, ironsights, and adds nice little tweaks.PROS:+ For a early 2000's game, the graphics are decent. Not fantastic, but you won't be looking at the game and throwing up.+ The environments are very well detailed. Even rooms that are out of the way with nobody in them are still lovingly put together. Except for a few reused missions near the end, there don't seem to be many glaringly reused assets, and as you go to different places around the world they defintely put care into making you feel like you were there.+ Good arsenal of weapons, although some are clearly not as good as others. You'll likely stick with the same few weapons for your team every time you play, but the choices are nice.+ Tight shooting. Each weapon handles fairly well and as with real life, burst fire and semi-auto will take enemies out way faster than spraying. Playing with the mod adds ironsights, but in vanilla there are none, making it more akin to Counter Strike in how you aim (although you can still zoom in slightly).+ Great tactics. Planning out your entry is always worth your time, and failing a mission can, yes, feel like utter BS, but then you can go back and study where you went wrong. You tweak your plan, change this and that, and when you're finished your plan goes smooth as butter. Even if you don't use the planning screen and go in blind (which I've done for a few), you still have a good repetoire of on-site tactics at your disposal. Order your team to burst in a door guns blazing, or maybe soften them with flashbangs, or you can tell them to go in on command so you can hurry over to a good vantage point to aid them from a flanking position. Basically, if you liked the quick tactics of R6 Vegas and Vegas 2, you'll catch on quick here.+ As always with the early R6 games, the music is fantastic. You'll get pumped up for sure.MEH:~ The story is ok. Nothing special, just enough to keep you going in one direction.~ Limited movement. In the early R6 games you could mantle and climb, but here you can't even go up a 2 foot platform without finding stairs. You get used to it, though.~ Your team AI can be a mixed bag. Most of the time they're great, and they'll spot and kill enemies you didn't notice, and they have far better reactions than you (obviously, since they're not human!). A few times, though, they can get a bit irritating. (Minor Spoilers ahead, although I'll try to stay vague). There's a point where you go to stop some chemical weapons, and enemies in hazmat suits are the ones that activate them if you're spotted. Unfortunately, those hazmat dudes are ""non combatants"" and thus your team members dont target them! I lost that mission so many times because my team wouldn't open fire on those enemies, simply because those enemies weren't a real ""threat"" to us!~ While it has been updated to modern resolution settings, the main menu is still locked at like, 800x600 or something.CONS:- Enemy AI can be a pain. Missions with hostages can be suddenly lost because they open fire on hostages since they know you're here. Thing is, they /shouldn't/ know you're there. You'll have to be extra careful playing this game, because there WILL be times that you lost because of BS enemy AI.- Dated controls. Be sure to edit the controls before you start playing.

												This is the benchmark for tactical shooters on the PC, and has yet to be surpassed by any other game. Raven Shield and the other original Rainbow 6/Rogue Spear games are true tactical counter-terrorism simulations, based on real weapons and tactics used in modern day counter terrorist operations. You plan your mission, you don't get to save during a mission, and it's one-shot and you're dead. No regenerating health, and when an operative dies it is final. I love Raven Shield because of the punishing difficulty, and emphasis on being the first to spot your opponent and quickly aim for the head. I think this is a good representation for close quarters combat, as close as you can get to real life. I love this game, and it's sad to see the Tom Clancy and Rainbow Six licenses being sold down the river. Everything after RVS and Athena Sword has been dumbed down garbage for the masses. Rainbow Six was never meant to appeal to the call of duty or counter strike crowd, it was in a class of its own. I got this game when it came out in 2003 and I just re-installed it, and it's as good as ever. I've beaten the single player 4 times, twice on elite, and it doesn't get any better than the feeling of successfully completing a mission with no fatalities. I have spent countless hours on multiplayer, which is also great too. I can only hope they make more games like this, because there are no modern games that come close to realism and tactical depth like Raven Shield does.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think I owned this game set before laptops came into the stores! Well my disks gave up finally such a nice box and everything so reignited the set through steam at a reasonably low sale price and glad I did. It still holds up even though I know the maps inside out you can still alter your approach tactically and yes I still get killed. The AI is still merciless but when I have a 'casual' hour I open this game...............(note); do not play casually or your team will get 'wiped out' as our controller states all too often through the mike. Yep! you really do still need to concentrate your moves even after playing all these more modern shooters etc. Tactics, squad selection still are priority as are weapon choices. It's nice that the 'heartbeat' monitor is still there though for some of us ;) A great old spec force game set with both games attached. I wouldn't imagine that multiplayer is still around but who cares! This is still a great game to go back to especially at elite difficulty and by yourself (Lone Wolf). 7.2/10 as a vintage score also.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The epitome of tactical first person shooter video games, and unfortunately the last of its kind. The gameplay of Rainbow Six 3 focuses heavily on the careful formulation and execution of player-made tactical plans in hypothetical scenarios, having players designate specific waypoints and commands to squads of soldiers in the game world (of which they also play the soldiers themselves after planning) in order to complete various objectives. While this may seem tiresome and mundane for players wanting instant and intense action (planning is optional), the reward for having a tactical plan execute successfully is extremely satisfying, considering the difficulty of the scenarios and the respective time taken to fully plan for them. Throw in a completely seamless multiplayer component and the thrills of planning tactical missions together with friends become unforgettably fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love this game SO much.  Controls 11/10, actually the best I've ever experienced.  There are a lot of tactical options, but somehow they made it all intuitive to where you can just do the training, and jump right into the first missions and probably beat it on the easiest level.  Gameplay 10/10.  Maps are well thought out, and immersive.  Enemies act how you think they would act for a given difficulty level.  Example:  They don't just mercilessly mow you down right out of the gate on easy, and on hard they pretty much do lol.  When I get killed, it's always been because I missed a guy hiding, wasn't patient enough, etc.  I have yet to feel like the game is cheating, using cheap exploits, etc.Story...  2/10 It seems to be be pretty rudimentary.  Elite strike force, assault, recon, or infiltration missions with brief backstory (""Terrorists are occupying an oil refinery unless their buddy gets released.  Go kill them."").  I have not finished the base game yet, so maybe there is something more to come here, and shooters just didn't have plots as a general rule in the good old days, but it would have been nice to flesh it out a little more.  It is what it is.  The game is fantastic, but don't play it expecting a Skyrim type story.  It's purely a tactical shooter as far as I can tell at this point.Online play - Have not tried it yet, though I read in forums some people still play.  Will try it after I finish the solo campaigns.DLC - 10/10.  Comes with one expansion (Athena Sword), and another is free to download, although it was a bugger to get installed (Iron Wrath).  Honestly, this is a game I see myself playing every map in every expansion too, so I'm happy for the extra content.Overall - 10/10.  I find myself not really caring about the story while I am playing, because it's that tactical rush, and the controls and game play are so well thought out it's HIGHLY addictive.  I compare the combat to the last game I played, Skyrim Legendary Edition.  I constantly felt like Skyrim abused the somewhat clunky and sluggish combat mechanics unfairly, was TOTALLY unbalanced in parts, although I loved it.  I never get that feeling with R63.  You CAN beat the missions if you know what you're doing.  Sure, that occasionally means level memorization and trial and error, but it's actually pretty fun, and I've even replayed some missions just to see if I could do them better.  This game is a GEM, and I find myself wishing all games were like this, and not caring about the somewhat dated graphics.  Actually, I kind like the graphics.  They don't get in the way or slow down my PC, very functional and kind of a retro appeal.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED especially at $4.99.  Some of the other trash on here for $4.99 makes me laugh in comparison.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Given the game's age, that is a good indicator of how great it is!If you only intend to play this with a friend co-op style, there is a revamp mod called RavenShield that updates the graphics quite a bit. However, installing this mod will make it so you cannot connect to ""vanilla"" servers.Also, you'd hate this game; there's no hats to collect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game back from the days when publishers were not afraid to expected player to think beyound their 12year old super-egos. This game included tactical planning map where player can spend more time planning before each mission their movement, than actually playing the shooting part. What a heresy by todays consumers standards. Today ""tactical shooter"" equals to FPS having some basic cover system mechanics implemented and that is it, you still go ""Rambo"" on army of easy to kill soldiers. In summary still the best single player tactical shooter I have played ever (maybe a bit on par with Swat4 probably), for the price it will give you sooo many hours of great tactical gameplay and atmosphere. Plus great satisfaction once your painfully crafted plan manages to get you through the level without any casualties on your team.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® 3, is thee best Rainbow Six to date. Quite unlike any modern-day shooter games. If you're after realism and fun this game is for you. Best part of the game quite possibly is the ability to plan the missions and execute them in perfection. Managing the routes taken by each squad and the ""go codes"" to synchronise the assault.I have never came across a game to date with this kind of planning its a real shame the way Ubisoft have strayed the franchise, making it similar to all of the rest of the shooters. The game is tough and unforgiving, usually ending a life with a single shot. If a person is KIA in the game they are permanently gone. Thus if you are a perfectionist it will take a while to get round the map, you're taking your time, leaning slowly around every corner. Be warned, can become stressful after a hours playing & planning and then final terrorist kill you. You can play on, but I have a thing for keeping all my guys alive!

												The game puts you in control of a squad of 3 men who act as covering fire aswell as other back up and support. This adds to the games diversity and you feel a real sense of leadership as you command your troops. Also the game is alot more realistic to other FPS games, in RS3 if you take a couple bullets you die and if you happen to live you dont have any method of regaining your health as there are no health packs. This is one of the elements that makes the game so tactical, the minute you come under fire you become so cautious and become alot more aware of your surroundings looking for cover etc. The troops make you feel a sense of security to a degree but the minute you lose a man you really feel the loss and again become more and more cautious knowing your out numbered. However when you craft a tactical raid on a room full of terrorists with your team and neutralize the enemy with precision you also feel a great sense of achievement. The game has a gradual learning curve and the levels become difficult at a nice pace.			",313,18,14,20,6,2,27

												I picked this game up after reading reviews and hearing about the ""old days"" of Rainbow Six, and I'll be honest, this game is BRUTAL.  It seems like RvS already had figured out a formula that is used by many games today to make them more realistic, 1 shot kills with the correct caliber bullet and so forth.  The game also makes sure you actually care about your teammates because if one dies, he (or she) is gone for the campaign.  RvS also sports a very large weapons arsenal that competes wiht today modern shooters.  The only real downside is that the multiplayer isn't very active (unless you want to play on modded servers, not my personal preference).			",219,15,6,14,20,0,20

												Rainbow Six 3 is the last great tactical shooter in the legendary Tom Clancy Rainbow series of first-person shooters. It is also the last iteration to offer pre-mission planning with multiple teams, although this version only had three possible teams when the legacy games allowed for four teams.A testament to any video game is the life of the multiplayer lobby. While RVS is obviously not carrying the numbers as during its peak, there are still active Ubisoft U-Play servers ten years after the release of the base game and the expansion pack, Athena Sword.

												Raven Shield is what many (myself included, if I'm honest) consider to be the best Rainbow Six game, as all the following entries in the series either fail at realism, (Lockdown) or straight-up take the 'arcade' route. (Vegas)It's often compared to the likes of Counter-Strike, and I'd honestly say that it's better. This is because it adds a lot more to the table in terms of weapons, game modes, maps, decent AI opponents and team mates, as well as allowing you to perform more actions; as an example, you're able to 'fluidly' open doors so you can silently open it a crack to peep through, just swing it open, or even put a breaching charge on it.In terms of weapons/gadgets you can use, other than having literally a mountain of guns to pick from, (although I always say the FNC and Steyr AUG are the best ;) ) ranging from assault rifles, sniper rifles, sub-machine guns, shotguns, light machine guns and pistols (including automatic pistols), there are a whole load of grenades and other equip-able items you can pick from. For example, there are of course your typical frag and flashbang grenades in the game, but there are also CS teargas (and gasmasks you can take to counter this) and smoke grenades. Not to mention the various other explosives and utilities, such as claymores + remote detonators (no magic hostile presence-detecting ones like in other games), C4 explosives, heartbeat detectors and many more.Also, the iron-sight haters won't have a problem with R6 3:RS either, as they've still got the good ol' zoom - which shouldn't be an issue for those who dislike the zoom, as there are plenty of choices with scopes of varying types, as well as other attachments for your weapons.So yeah, essentially if you want to play a realistic and fun shooter with loads of different tactics and choices, get this!

												One of the greatest tactical game ever, the gameplay is awesome for a game of that time, the maps and the missions are real fun to do, there's a nice variety of weapons for a game of that time.I'd wish that Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear and its expansions would be on Steam too, at least Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® can be found on GoG.I'm not a fan of remakes but It would be great if they could make a remake of every Splinter Cell and Rainbow Six games, on a better and more complex engine so it can be even more tactical especially Rainbow Six Vegas since it's not as tactical as the previous ones, you cannot use Ironsights in this game (except with mods) so all of those games with a new fresh air would be real great, better than Rainbow Six Siege that's for sure, still the same game not like Rainbow Six Siege who looks exactly like the recent Call of Duty games, way too casual and boring.Anyway, great game that I would suggest to any Rainbow Six, tactical and FPS fans.9.5/10			",972,203,71,193,128,3,223

												Fantastic game! Don't care about the graphics. It is outdated yes, but the gameplay makes you forget all about it as it is just amazing to be an officer for Rainbow Six.This is the last best game in the series (Still waiting for the cod version of Rainbow Six, aka Siege), and is a must if you love S.W.A.T. 4 or any of the Rainbow Six games before Siege. If you love tactical shooters in general, this is a must buy.Rainbow Six 3 has a really systematic and a fantastic planing phase, where you decide all the orders of what Teams Red, Green and Yellow shall do (if you have more than one team). You get to decide movement, actions, aggressiveness and order other teams/your team to wait until you give the command to move or the other team is ready. The enemy A.I. is not great, they react poorly to sounds and friendly corpses. If you run, they'll hear you through floors, if you shoot, they'll only hear you if your standing next to them. If they witness someone die, they don't care, why should they?Shooting feels great and realistic. It is really hard to hit something if you're not aimed down your sight. If you spray, you'll miss your target and probably die. Bullets are deadly, meaning you'll die in just a few bullets even with the heavy gear. You're not a bullet sponge, be careful around corners.Leaning, leaning around corners is REALLY important here, and they've done a fantastic job with that. There is the standard q and e to lean, but also ctrl. With controll, you can lean how ever you want, it makes taking cover a much easier job than in other shooters.RS3 has the standard gamemodes, Terrorist Hunt (killing terrorists), Hostage Rescue, Bomb defusal and so on. However, in RS3, hostages can and will be shot by Ts, if not careful. If they're alerted, they'll shot them without hesitation. Plan your moves, don't run and gun, and be f#cking careful.I love the Rainbow Six series, and fully recommend getting all of them. They are fantastic games, and hopefully Siege will be as well.

												There are more reviews here but mine is simple.  Rainbow Six - Raven Shield and a close cousin to this series: Ghost Recon (original) are the best in tactical games and to this day have yet to be duplicated in any other form by which may we still refer to a shooter as ""tactical"".  If you have not gotten this game then buy it.  If you have it - PLAY IT!  Dont fall for the bananna in the tailpipe from others who claim Vegas and others in the Tom Clancy line are ""tactical"".  They are not.  They are, instead, dumbed down for the mass market who does not like to think for themselves - the ones we call ""bro-dudes"" and, ""casual"".Instead.  Avoid what UbiSoft foists on us as tactical and forget the BS that is Call of Duty and Battlefield and instead return to what started this whole ""military"" genre - the original Tom Clancy titles like R Six 3.Go get your copy you will not be sorry.

												Engaging, fun, and tactical as♥♥♥♥♥♥Only issuses are that there are so many guns that some have no point of being in the game are directly inferior to others.For instance, there are about 3 or 4 MP5 variants, when i garuntee you, you're only going to be using the MP5 SSD and abandoning the rest.Also, the weapon handling is a bit rediculous.If you're standing still, in any position, and literally do nothing but look around, the spread violently increases. It makes combat incredibly clunky, unable to make the quick, precise shots you should be able to make.Recoil is a bit overly exaggerated too. If you have something like an M14, it will have 5x the recoil of another weapon, even if it fires the same cartridge as it.The damage is also a bit insane. A pistol will take 4-5 shots to kill at point blank, which you have to take standing still, not moving your mouse around even slightly, while also slowly delaying your shots to let the spread relax point blank, while a rifle will take 1-2 shots to kill.It makes the sidearms completley pointless and incredibly worthless considering the enemies will target you in miliseconds and it will take you minutes to kill them with one.Other than those issues, the game is great.

Plan your moves, don't run and gun, and be f#cking careful.I love the Rainbow Six series, and fully recommend getting all of them. They are fantastic games, and hopefully Siege will be as well.

												Rainbow Six 3, like most of Tom Clancy's titles, is a squad-based tactical shooter with a lot of depth. This game favors tactics over action, and you will spend hours planning out each mission before actually playing it. Before a mission, you can choose who goes on what team (Alpha, Charlie, etc.), choose their loadouts (a lot of weapons to choose from, each with their own advantages and disadvantages), and plan out the mission waypoint by waypoint. Once you are comfortable with how the planning stage works, you can coordinate attacks from multiple angles, give go-codes to execute orders, set the rules of engagement, and so on. The game gives you the option to either play through the mission or watch the AI do what you have told them to do. It's a really nice option, because it's basically two totally different styles of gameplay. You can play it as a strategy game, being the man calling the shots, or play it through the eyes of a Rainbow operative. Pick this one up.			",548,87,14,62,58,3,103

												Widely regarded as the greatest iteration of the series, Rainbow Six 3 was the last version of the tactical shooter retaining a planning phase. The circle crosshair is the sole means of aiming most weapons that are left in standard configuration, but an optic can be added to many longarms, and a version 2.0 mod., available from moddb, allows for aiming with Iron sights. Weaponry can not be picked up from enemies during a mission. No content is locked, all is available to use from the start. Leaning, stance change (standing, crouching, and prone), and stance adjust are available, but peaking around corners from an over the shoulder or third person vantage point is not. This Steam offering lacks the Iron Wrath expansion (if you would like an easy to install version of said Iron Wrath expansion, see the link in the linked youtube video description below).See these :

												Out of all of the games in the Rainbow Six series, this one is my favorite. The graphics are decent enough, and the gameplay is fun and addicting. Slow stealthy cautious strategies tend to win the day over rapid reckless Rambo-style running-and-gunning. The game has a vibrant map making community and there are many custom maps available after the official maps have been mastered. If you join a game that is using a map you don't already have, the game will automatically download the map from the server for you.			",81,6,0,25,2,0,11

												Ahh...the memories!  When this game first came out in 2003, my friend and I played this co-op and was a nice alternative to Quake 2.  This game is a thinking man's shooter, where you can plan out your 'teams' mission before you enter the playing arena.  Or you can use the default plan and jump right into the action.  This is NOT a game where you can take all kinds of damage or heal after a few seconds of hiding in cover.....one shot - one kill.  Nice feature is when you do die,  you respawn very near if not in the same spot where the 'oops' took place.  If you are looking for a Run-n-Gun shooter, this is not for you.  If you are looking for a tactical, near realistic shooter .......what are you waiting for ..... get it already!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can one say about R6:Raven shield?. Pure excellence - it's the last great Rainbow Six from the long running series, at least in terms of tactical gameplay. The rainbow six vegas games put an emphasis on action and nonstop brawl over the slow, tactically and ""smart"" gameplay that dominates the 3 first games. It takes what made the first 2 excellent and further pushes it. Some still say Rainbow Six: Rogue spear is the pinnacle of the series but i still feel the 3rd installment is the best one. It gives you the tools and gameplay to push Rainbow Six as far as you want it to go. It's emphasis is more on the neutralization of targets and objectives and it's somewhat more ""intense"" then say for example Swat 3/4 which has a focus on doing things with the bare minimum of violence. Rainbow Six: raven shield gives you all the tools to do what you feel works best, being less lethal takedowns with flashbangs, or the brute force tactic of breaching charges and frag grenades - all the tools are there to be played around with for one of the most interesting tactical shooters in the last 15 years.Must buy for any tactical shooter junkie.

												This game is quite fun. Better than some of the modern games that are released... Gameplay This is a tactical FPS game, in which you can control small squads of soldiers to eleminate a hostile threat or rescue one or more hostages. The game continues off of the story-line of the other Rainbow Six games. Once I started to play, I rapidly enjoyed the game more and more. Side-Notes  This game should run fine on about any computer created past 2003, I would think. The controls are smooth, some may need rebinding or just to be bound in general once you start up. The tutorial is recommended, seeing that I had absolutly no clue on how to play this game until playing through them.I would rate this 95/100. Quite a fun time, if you enjoy these types of games.

												Rainbow-6 3 Gold edition is an old breath of fresh air, back to the time when you did not need to pump out 50% of the game, then charge extra to actually complete it. Back to the time when Tactical gameplay was at its peak, back before Rainbow-6 Seige ruined it by making the characters have special abilities and making them so diverse they don't even look like a police unit (I mean Sledge has a freaking Plad scarf on his shoulder, and Jackal looks like he came from a 1950s scifi movie.) Back when games where well thought out, graphics did not make a difference, and all the weapons play differently (Well if you look closly that is)Cons- Basically almost every mission I do I just have 90-100% of my team equiped with suppressors because they like to kill the hostages out right at the first gunshot.- AI is pretty bad, but really they just stand in one place so, it does not really matter.- It is easier to just go in FPS style and have you team follow you, rather than set out a plan that may or (Usually) does not work at all (Especially on Hostage missions, so like 60-70% of the missions)Besides that its pretty good.8/10			",57,1,0,4,4,0,7

												A distanza di anni ho rigiocato questo capitolo della serie: per me il più bello in assoluto. Un gioco bello..lo è per sempre. Davvero difficile..e necessita di uno studio approfondito delle strategie per completare correttamente la missione. Non sono molte missioni, ma alcune sono parecchio ostiche, perché la AI non perdona proprio..è davvero eccellente. Altrettanto importante è preservare gli uomini migliori del gruppo, perché man mano che si avanza..le cose si fanno più difficili.Consigliatissimo, tutti i giocatori almeno una volta devono provare le sensazioni uniche che ti regala questo gioco.                          After many years, i re-played this chapter of the series, for me the most beautiful of the serie (3rd one). If one game is very good .. is very good forever. Hard and complex .. it requires a thorough study of the strategies to successfully complete the mission.There are not so many missions, but some are quite difficult, because the AI does not forgive anything .. it's really excellent.Equally important is to preserve the best men in the group, because as you go ahead with the campaign .. things get more difficult.Highly recommended, all players must try at least once a unique experience that gives you this game.

												I played all tom clancy games but i never tried out the rainbow games and i just want to say the game is very very good.But FOR ALL OF YOU THAT HAVE NEVER PLAYED THE GAME, THIS IS NOT LIKE CALL OF DUTY WHERE YOU CAN GO AND MURDER EVERYTHING FINISH THE OBJECTIVE AND TA TA YOU WIN AND PASS ON TO THE OTHER LEVEL ,I AM NOT THAT GOOD IN THIS GAME BECAUSE IM NOT USED TO PLAY TACTICAL SHOOTERS LIKE THIS , I HAD A LOT OF FAILS IN THE FIRST MISSION ON THE CAMPAIGN I PLAYED IT FOR  HOURS ON THE FIRST LEVEL I PLAYED THE GAME ON VETERAN AND I WOULD FINISH LAST WITH ALL MY MEN DEAD BUT I SOMEHOW MANAGED TO THE LEVEL IN SWITZERLAND ,and the best part is that everything is realistic like most games should be today, 1 bullet you are injured  another shot R.I.P not like in games where you get shot 100 bullets in you and you are still alive,  and if somebody of your men die in the campaign they die forever they do not appear later on you must choose another person to be in your team .Beside this there are some cons that i would like to mention ,you have a lot of weapons that are very good but there are a lot of which are basically useless in the game ,other thing i would like to say is that the recoil is a bit too much for some weapons, and i dont understand one thing ,the terrorists would usualy target you in milliseconds and kill you in miliseconds  and you need 2-3 seconds to take them down ,i dont understand how does an uzi killed me from 1 km far away and i am shooting at him with a scoped ak 74 ,another thing is if enemies spot you from a tiny hole and kill you in one second , i found theese issues frustrating however i liked the game a lot and had a lot of fun with it .

												Great game, one of my all time favourites. Its worth buying at sale time for $5. You should get about 40 - 80 hours out of it. Be sure to have a look at gameplay and reviews to see what its like (apparently is quite different to the newer Rainbow Six games) in that it is very tactical, think SWAT 3 and SWAT 4.Also, in terms of multiplayer I cannot comment as I haven't played multiplayer.Single player is great. You get about 17 missions in a campaign and 8 skirmish maps to play on for Rainbow Six 3, and a campaign with about 8 missions and 8 skirmish maps for the Athena Sword add on pack included in this Gold Edition. Also, you can download for free the Iron Wrath expanision pack which adds even more missions and maps (there is plenty of info out there about how to get this going for the Steam verison).The missions are usually about killing or terrorists, saving hostages and diffusing bombs in a tactical way. A fair bit of time is spent planning and replaying the missions and this may be a turn off for those who just want action. A few other modes are available including terrorist hunt, hostage rescue and lone wolf that add to replayability. There are about 60 odd guns in the game with everything from submachine guns to sniper rifles plus things like CS gas and stun grenades.Downsides:- A fair bit of time is spent planning as opposed to playing eg a usual mission will take about 10 minutes of planning and 5 minutes of action but expect to be replaying the mission and doing the planning phase plenty of times over.- Enemy and friendly AI can be really bad at times.- Old game (2004?) so graphics aren't going to be great.- I'd say buy it at sale time for a big discount as at $10usd you may feel ripped off.

												A realistic game, if you can call a shooter that. Exteremely quick (and in the campaing, permanent) death, slow movement and the ability to carry only one rifle, one sidearm and 6 grenades at most are somewhat realistick but don't believe it when people call this game hyper realistic. The game's immersion is broken easily by things like hip-fire reticlespread applying even when using a scope. The relatively braindead ai is a known problem, but it doesnt matter because the enemy isn't supposed to do anything else than react to hearing gunfire and fire at you when they see you. Your teammates on the other hand do just fine, because they do as they are told and don't improvise anything stupid. Except when they decide to fall off from a ladder and die, forcing you to restart the mission. The pseudo-randomized enemy placement and the sometimes unreliable teammate ai make sure that however well you plan your missions, you will need at least one retry before you get the desired no casualty -run. The fact that planning your mission can take up a good 20-30 minutes and executing the plan take a rough 5 min depending on mission. That is, if you get it working on the first try. Fixing your plan between retries can easily take up a cumulative 30min unless you have to redo the plan altogether. All that combined and you can waste an evenening just trying to complete that one hostage recue. The game can be very frustrating on the other hand very satisfying when you finally complete that one mission. Despite everything negative I said about the game, it is in my opinion an enjoyable experience. Just as a word of warning: This is not an fps Dark Souls, in this game you move a lot slower but die a lot faster. You can end up 6 feet below in a literal heartbeat. Have fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you ever felt like FPS games today were just shooting galleries, then you should probably pick up this game.I was there, I fought the war against Supersoldier-Nazi-Terrorists from the future. I played Rainbow Six on the console and I beat it once... only once. The game has you playing against Supersoldier-Nazi-terrorists from the future, seriously you should watch the intro... that's the only way I can explain the story, for America. You thought CoD: World at War was deep? This game is deeper. This game is about fighting for America.... in Switzerland.As a fun, challenging game, Rainbow Six has you taking control of up to three teams and with you planning out their movements along with placing checkpoints yourself. As you start the mission and having your teams following their pre-constructed paths, they will all inevitably die to the incredible aim of the Super-soldier-Nazi-Terrorists (I always manually take control of teams and members to make sure no one dies). Still, it was much easier than the console version which basically had you and three other guys (or four, I forgot) with no backup and running into a whole lotta crossfires and traps. Men get blown to pieces by Terrorists with their grenades and you will get cutdown mercilessly by molten metal fired from the barrels of hidden guns.This game is easier, with the ability to pre-plan your movements and the ability to take control of multiple teams and team members. This game isn't about twitch shooting or aim, it's about precaution. Precaution as in, ""Don't run in clear view of a sniper you dumb♥♥♥♥."" The game doesn't hold your hand and requires a lot of luck at times, but in all honesty it is how you plan and how you plan to execute it along with a plan B if everything goes wrong. If you find firefights too frustrating, the game even allows aim assist (the equivalent of aimbotting). You have to anticipate the ♥♥♥♥♥iest situations and how to deal with them. I like the weapons, most of them have different stats and have situational advantages during some missions. However, shotguns are completely inaccurate unless you've got a scope on it (which I find strange).Team members also have stats and it somewhat rewards you for keeping them alive. The more men survive through missions the better stats they get, so they can aim better, run better, etc. Always keep stealth team members with other stealth team members otherwise the other dudes in the group will give them away. Having a balanced number of team members and organizing their equipment is actually.... fun.I get to choose what weapon to use, what grenades I want and who I want with me. Yeah, the game can get frustrating at times, but mostly it is your fault if you lose. You have to observe enemy movement, study their patrol paths and watch them intently then plan actions accordingly. You can't run in every room throwing a smoke grenade because of your limited supplies. The heartbeat sensors actually make the game easier because you can see where terrorists are going through the walls and doors (console game had thermal vision). You're never supposed to fight the enemy head-on not unless you've put yourself in a advantageous situation (i.e. smoked room enemy can't see you, flash bang renders terrorists unable to fight back etc.).Multiplayer is also a blast, if you ever get to play just use your Uplay account username and password. I had to play with three or so other guys against hordes of terrorists in the other room with us throwing tear gas this way and that. There are plenty of wonderful pvp and pve levels that has you killing terrorists on top of buildings, in cities, on boats and wherever the strange and unique level designs take you. Did I tell you I got to fight Nazi Terrorists... IN SPACE?!Go buy it but keep in mind it's tough difficulty and sometimes frustrating nature.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. I enjoyed Vegas 2 immensely as well but Rainbow six 3 is just superior. It is so amazing when you set out a complex plan and have your team execute it successfully. The shooting in this game is also quite fun and there is a good challenge to it. This game is all about setting up a strategy for your 1-8 team members (each are unique and have their own stats like sniping, electronics, etc), in which you can create 1-3 fire teams and set up complex orders for them in the planning stage. You can set ""go codes"" which mean a team will wait for a player order to set up a synchronized attack (such as having gold team breach and clear and green team toss a tear gas grenade in, while red team sets up a sniping potion to protect the flanks).The missions are fun and have excellent map design where multiple different strategies can be executed. There is perma-death for everyone so you must be careful with their lives.The AI while basic at times can be quite intelligent. It can flank you, toss grenades, retreat to a different area and even surrender (careful sometimes a surrendering enemy will have an enemy their to flank you when you try to cuff the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥).This is a game for a more intellectual FPS gamer and is the best Rainbow Six game out there (I've played them all except siege but that is nothing like this game at all). This game runs perfectly at 1080p (although the menus/movies don't but it is still fine) and I have not had a single issue with it at all (I have mostly played on a non-steam version but have just bought this one for the included expansion pack).

 Easily one of the best FPS games on the market, I don't care what anyone says regarding that.  Right off the bat you're given complete reign of a counter-terrorism unit, you decide who gets to participate in the mission, what weapons to use, and how to execute the mission. This makes the game feel like a breath of fresh air from modern ""drop right in"" or linear FPS games (CSGO, COD, Recent TC titles) as you actually have a reasonable amount of control over  the situation in the game. The game mechanics themselves (ie: controls, callouts, ect.) do feel fairly clunky at times and pose a slight learning curve, but after that, you're practically done with game learning curves.The in-game stories are what you would expect: ""Terrorists do bad things and you have to stop them,"" so insight into morals and life should not be what you expect from this (I don't know why you'd expect that but nvm). Pros: Loads of weapons.Dirt cheap asking price (£4.99 is a steal).Feels about as realistic you can get to actually thwarting terrorists.Map design feels amazing.No Uplay (YES).Loads of control over the game.  Cons: Boring to new players - New players migrating from modern FPS games will probably find this game difficult to enjoy at first.No basegame ironsights (Mods can probably fix that).Clucky controls. 10/10 One of the Best FPS Games on the Market  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Remember way back when games were simpler and yet still challenging?"" Well, this game is certainly much more challenging, but has the complexity of a game way ahead even most current games. Take for example in Battlefield, you can open doors, well while in this you can slowly scroll the scroll mouse button (MB 3) to slowly open a door, or a shutter. The character customization is spot on: Change your character (Individual appearances), their class, armour type, armour camo/colour, loadout (Guns, attachments, equipment, gadgets), squads (Up to 2full+1), squad commands, smart AI (allied and enemy), incredible level design, challenging missions, co-op (online with special set ups or local LAN set ups), firing range/tutorial.Certainly there is something I missed, but there is just too much to name. Its an amazing game with amazing mechanics and tactical gameplay. Its challenging, its fun, its definetly not short, and it sure is worth your time!			",110,8,1,8,3,0,4

												Let me say this first: This is a great game and I have enjoyed it tremendously. The only real problem with this game is Ubisoft. They shut down the key servers and now playing in multiplayer is impossible, yes also with a LAN service. You need to open an internet game to connect via search for IP and when you try to connect using that, the games tries to verify your key and since the servers are down you get an error message. They did this some years ago for the add on Athena Sword and now with the main game Raven Shield.This is now a purely single player game and thus dead for me.It is a great tactic shooter and I haven't found anything like it since then.Edit: There is a fan patch out now that circumvents the CD check and loads another serverlist. I think you can search for a lan game via direct IP as well. With this it's again possible to play multiplayer, either with the new serverlist or with a vpn.With this patch I can now endorse this again, although it's still a shame how Ubisoft handled this.

												UPDATE: Someone supplied a patch that restored online functionality for the base game. The game is now one of the best FPSes in existence once more and an easy buy recommendation. I'll leave my original review for posterity.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Until about a year ago this was a no-brainer. Great multiplayer and a variety of maps and equipment.Then Ubisoft shut down the key activation server for the addon (but not the main game) so suddenly half the maps and some of the guns became singleplayer-only. That was annoying.Now they shut down the key activation server for the main game and tagged it as singleplayer only in Steam. It's not nearly as fun in singleplayer. So go buy Arma instead. (Heck, at this point Takedown: Red Saber has better multiplayer, which is like saying that your home country is now poorer than Burundi.)Thank you, Ubisoft, for protecting me from great multiplayer gameplay.

												I was already familiar with the original Xbox version, though my memory of it isn't detailed, and the semi-modern Vegas games. Both Vegas games have their fair share of problems, including bad third-person cover systems, enemies that spawn behind you, nonsensical instant deaths, sound glitches, and (in the case of Vegas 2) a sprint function that makes the multiplayer feel more like a slower CoD than a tactical shooter. Everyone on the internet told me that RS3 is better in every way, the definitive tactical shooter.They were wrong.Rainbow Six 3 has enemies that can't hear gunfire from 10 feet away or see their friends die right in front of them, but they are quite capable of seeing through brick walls and hearing footsteps from across the room. On more than one occasion, I died at random, one time by an explosion that didn't have an accompanying grenade or terrorist.The weapon selection is decent, though I find it hard to find anything to be excited about. You can customize your weapons by choosing between features like an extended mag, a scope, or a silencer. Some weapons have multiple ammo types which don't really matter in a terrorist hunt. Character customization does not exist, but it isn't really needed.Movement is slow, but that's to be expected. What isn't expected is the painfully slow sidestep. Having manual control over the motion of opening doors, crouching, and leaning is interesting and will probably be useful for hardcore players. The most welcome function is the ability to lean around corners. That's what tactical shooters are: Q and E to lean. Not recommended.			",255,40,10,24,14,4,29

												If you're the kind of person who loves babysitting embarrassingly bad AI teammates, ""untrained amateur"" enemies who can snipe across a map with a pistol and a control scheme that was outdated five years before this game was released, then go for it! If you're the kind of person who confuses arbitrary difficulty in a game for tactical depth, then this is literally the only game you need to ever play. If you have ever complained about how games these days are dumbed-down and stuff used to be better ""in the good old days"", then when pushed to explain why, mumbled something about planning phases, then by God, buy a thousand copies of this game.For the rest of you, pretend you played this game. Pretend you thought it was better than Rainbow Six: Vegas. Then go back to playing decent games. One to avoid.			",314,18,2,37,15,1,23

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Gold includes both the original Raven Shield and its expansion, Athena Sword. In both games, you'll command the world's most elite multinational force of counter-terrorist operatives in missions around the world.

												You hear the slow, incessant chirp. The pause between each beep seems to get shorter and shorter, but it could be your imagination. There's a corner between you and the bomb. You slooowly ease around the wall, practically kissing your MP5 as you strain to make out the shape of an arm, a head, a sign that someone is around that corner, lying in wait for an operative like yourself.There's no one. You run up to the bomb, and are immediately shot in the back of the head. You have no idea where it came from, no corners of your vision conveniently glowing red to give an indication of where your assassin is. You can't back out and wait for a few seconds to heal up. You got shot in the back of the head. It's over. Your man is dead. And it was your fault.You didn't look up.They don't make 'em like this anymore.I've been playing this game since 2005. It has never gotten old. If I had to choose one game from my entire library to keep, it would be this. And if you're the sort of person who thinks this is ""too hard"" or ""too boring,"" and goes back to knife people in Call of Warfare 23 or Modern Duty 97 or something, then I'm sorry, you /are/ an inferior human being.Tactical shooters are dead. Long live Rainbow Six 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the benchmark against which I measure all other tactical shooters and trust me when I tell you that practically no other game that has come out after Raven Shield measures up to it. SWAT 4 is very close but RVS comes out on top. In Rainbow Six 3 you take control of an international counter-terrorist unit called Rainbow and your job is to prevent terrorists from doing whatever it is that they are trying to do. To achieve this you use the powerful mission planner to plan your mission to the finest detail, coordinating up to three teams or a maximum of eight operatives. The planner will let you do anything you need to do to get the job done. For example you can set up go-codes to clear a room from multiple directions simultaneously. You can define how the teams make entry into a room: should they breach the door using a breaching charge? Should they throw in a flashbang or gas grenade before entering the room? You get the picture. You can also define the rules of engagement and movement speed of your teams for any waypoint. You can command them to be stealthy and only fire when fired upon for example or you can make them run and shoot on sight if you need to cover ground quickly to get to a hostage or bomb. The planner is awesome.After you've finished planning your mission you can equip your teams any way you want. There's a lot of gear to choose from. There are light, medium and heavy armor and they affect your stealthiness and speed. Light armor is quiet and stealthy but does not offer much protection. Medium is a great balance and heavy armor looks kind of like riot gear and gives you extra protection but all your actions like switching weapons, turning around etc take a little longer to complete. You'll also be louder when you move. Then there are the weapons. There's a huge selection of SMG's, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, pistols, machine pistols, grenades etc. There is also a selection of tactical gear like heartbeat sensors, demolition kits (to speed up defusing of bombs), lockpicking kits etc. You can equip each individual operative however you want.When you get in the mission itself you can switch between teams and operatives to control them at any time or you can stick to controlling your guy and let the AI do it's job according to the plan you've set out for those teams. The friendly AI is very good. The trailing guy will cover the rear of your team and they are very aware of their surroundings and they are accurate as well when firing. They're also good at clearing rooms. They get through the door quickly and each operative will cover their own area of responsibility in the room. You can command your AI team mates on the fly to perform actions like clearing rooms using breaching charges, flashbangs, gas grenades etc. You can also command them to pick locks, defuse bombs or to escort hostages out of harms way. You can perform these actions yourself also. The damage modelling is pretty awesome. You suffer different effects depending on where you're shot (if you're lucky enough to only get wounded that is). Your aim suffers a lot if you get hit in your arm for example. You can't run and your walking slows if you get hit in the leg and so on. Good mission planning is crucial because you want your team members to survive the mission so you can use them again. You have a limited number of operatives of varying skill levels and specialties and if they get wounded they will need time to heal before you can use them again. If they die you lose them for the rest of the campaign. The sounds are awesome too.The enemy AI could be a little better although there's nothing in their behaviour that would get really annoying during gameplay. Sometimes one of them will drop a grenade as he dies and after it goes off you can hear ""huh, what was that?"" from the next room as if you can't tell when a frag grenade goes off in the hallway. They're pretty good at coming to investigate noises and stuff like that and they will use cover and get backup if you miss your shot and they get away. On the hardest setting they can be pretty brutal and it's tough to complete missions without any casualties to your team unless you've planned it perfectly.After you get the hang of the game you can get online and you'll find there are still people playing. You can play adversarial modes or you can play the campaign missions co-operatively with your friends, coordinating take downs etc. using teamspeak for example. Multiplayer requires a ubi.com account and the game does lack voice comms of it's own but those are not big minuses.The game is still every bit as awesome as it was when it came out. The graphics are a bit dated but it will run like a dream in very high resolutions and with ridiculous amounts of AA and AF on. With those kinds of settings it looks pretty good. Also you can get a mod called Raven Shield 2.0 that will enhance the realism of the game to even higher levels adding things like iron sights and it also has higher resolution textures for the operators and terrorists enhancing the look of the game. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of tactical gaming and has somehow missed this gem. This is the best tactical shooter out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where do I even start with this one?      It's the gold standard of the Rainbow Six series for starters. The game is arguably the funnest tactical shooter ever and this is the game people point to when asked about a more tactical and professional feeling Rainbow Six game than the action games like Rainbow Six: Vegas. Being a game from 2003, the graphics look a bit rough, though that doesn't hurt the gameplay at all. You play as a sort of commander for the elite, international, blacker-than-black ops team Rainbow. Rainbow specializes in counter-terror and hostage rescue missions and are deployed when needed around the globe. This means that the levels take place across a variety of settings. You'll go from saving dignitaries in the Swiss alps to foiling bank robbers in London to clearing a mansion of baddies in the Cayman Islands. This keeps things unique and interesting throughout the game.      Each mission has a set pattern to it. You start by learning about the situation from Rainbow Six, the leader of Rainbow, and the other advisors with him. You then go to the team room where you select which operatives are going out on the mission, select their guns, armor, and other equipment, and choose what teams they'll be on. Then you go to the bread and butter of the game: the planning room. You are given a blueprint of the area and tasked with creating a plan for the teams to follow that will result in a successful mission. The planning system does take a bit of time to master but once the get the hang of things you'll find that the planning system is robust and customizable with a great depth to it. Once you have a plan created you can choose what team you'll be leading, in first person shooter style, through the action phase of the mission.      The action isn't as fast-paced as other games, but the methodical and tactical way that you can move through the area is unique, very enjoyable, and by no means boring. The action gameplay can shift from stealth to sychronized takedowns to all out gunfighting at a moments notice. The operatives and the terrorists all react realistically to bullets, meaning they die near-instantly. If that sounds too tough for the more tactical-minded gamers, you can also choose to observe the plan from a third-person flying camera and let the A.I take control of the operatives on the mission. You'll invariably find your plans don't always succeed, but there's much fun to be had from tweaking your plan until the teams move through the level like a well-oiled machine; to qoute the A-Team, ""I love it when a plan comes together."" On a related note there are pre-made plans that you can load in if you find the planning system too much to handle or are frustrated with repeated failures.    The last great feature of the game is the custom mission option. This gives you access to all the maps that you've unlocked in the campaign and some that are only available in this mode and allows you to create a random mission from a good amount of mission types. Replaying story missions, terrorist hunt, hostage rescue, and lone wolf wherein you are alone and needing to get to the extraction point. The custom mission feature garuntees that you won't get bored with this game. Add to all the goodness explained already the fact that there's still a thriving modding community keeping this game fresh and adding better graphics and more gameplay to this already massive game and you've got a shining gem of the tactical shooter genre that still hasn't been topped in the decade that it has been out.

												Both Gold Edition and Athena Sword are truly great and classic games, I always loved and admired a tactical shooter game, Rainbow Six 3 is truly immersive, intense and downright realistic, and having that realism will always put you at the edge of your seat and it is truly satisfying and rewarding to play.You have to really think before you act and execute your plan, you have to strategize because every move you make can mean life or death for you and your team, in this game you die quick if you don't react fast enough. Go play solo or with other players or with AI teammates, and lead them victory. With tons of maps, game modes like terrorist hunt and hostage rescue, plus a campaign, you'll spend hours and hours playing this game and you will surely enjoy it!			",38,0,2,0,3,0,7

It's not like the story is why you're playing it in the first place, right? You're playing because SWAT 4 is waaaay too confusing/hard but you still need to satisfy that craving to go full blown operator. Well, you are in luck friend.

												For me, this is a difficult game that demands in-depth planning and high vigilance to succeed. While most missions does not require stealth, it always gave me an advantage and left my teams alive. This game gives no perfect plan or a perfect way to accomplish a mission. With enemy AI with deadly accuracy, perma-deaths, and a lot of blind spots, it had me constantly tweaking my plan enough to beat the mission with minimal loss. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good challenge with enough patience to learn and accept risks.			",21,2,0,4,3,0,2

												When tactical shooters were actually tactical. A difficult but rewarding game that actual tries to be realistic. Call of Doody players need not apply.			",435,140,26,77,39,4,115

												Its showing its age now but Rainbow Six 3 is still the best tactical FPS in my opinion, and for my money is one of the best single player FPS experiences you can get, assuming you like your FPS slow and butal.			",216,62,6,45,23,2,38

												Still the best tactical shooter available.  Reminds me of how consoles have destroyed intelligent and innovative gameplay as well as a great series such as Rainbow 6.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My personal favorite shooter and it is the last shooter that really put your brains and reflexes at work, but a lot of times even that is not enough.. Old school game that is hard, modern games are easy anyway.. the opponent can be killed with one bullet, but you can be killed by a single one too and they react fast.. They are in locations you would not expect them to be.. If you are up for an tactical challenge this is awesome.			",84,1,5,6,3,0,1

												Amazing tacticool shooter, Very fun if you play with a friend. This game does require a lot of strategy so for all you call of duty try hards out  there this game is not for you.Fun things:a lot of guns that are customizableyou can open doors as much as you want example: you can use your scroll wheel to open a door a little then chuck a nade inthe default name is jon doeBad things:player system is hard to control when you first start playing takes 2 shots to dietolerable things:recoil is insane but realistic networking could be betteroverall this game is amazing and I would suggest you buy the game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												tl;dr This game is a tactical shooter, so it may not be for everyone. It can still be fun to play with people, granted they know what they are doing. The game may have some technical flaws (it being old). If you want to play good old Rainbow Six without wrestling with the Original's engine, pick this one up.Rainbow Six 3 is a squad based, tactical shooter. This game allows you to take control of the elite counterterrorism unit RAINBOW (yes, that's the name of the unit).This game is not something you rush into. You need tactics. The game has an entire planning phase where you can modify how each group of operatives moves. You can tell them to wait on your mark, then when you give the go-code, open the door and flash through it.Multiplayer still works, however you have to have a uPlay account. You could try lan or hamachi, but I didn't test that. The game has a mutlitude of weapons and armor for you to choose. You can use silenced smgs with flashbangs and go full on stealth, or use 50.cal snipers and M4's with frag grenades to go all out.This game is also not as easy as your usual FPS. You get a maximum of 1-3 hits before your dead. Everyone follows this rule. Once someone's dead, they can no longer be chosen, so make sure your teammates don't die.The game also has some mechanics that I've never seen any other FPS have before, or after. These are the fluid lean and door opening. Using the mouse, you can adjust your character to lean at many other angles other than one. Fluid door opening allows you to open doors halfway, a tiny bit, or just enough to let a grenade through.That said, the game has flaws. The planning stage is locked at ~800x600 (the game isn't but the menus are). The game can sometimes be a bit hard to get into, and you may have to do levels over and over to make sure your preferred teammates didn't die. This game is way different than alot of FPSes out today (Call of Duty, Team Fortress, and Battlefield aren't very comparable. Counter-Strike is a bit comparable, but still has alot of differences).
