												You spend the majority of your time sitting in a disgusting ditch filled with the shattered corpses of your fallen comrades, as well as those still unfortunate to be ""alive"", if you can even use that term to describe what is left of those wretches. As you crawl through soggy trenches, you can hear the shouts of orders being given and soldiers being slain, either blown to torn meat by mortar explosions or cut in half from machine gun fire. You are not a man, you are a frightened rabbit that dashes from cover to cover, whispering wishes of survival for but a few more seconds while pieces of concrete are chipped away around you by enemy sharp shooters. In the worst of times, you are a worm that crawls in the mud, lest a rifleman spots your shape in the distance. There is no salvation from a tank. Death can come from nowhere at all. Stay away fom windows.Also, you can't drop more than five feet without breaking a leg. It's fine though, since your small pack of two bandages offers you a second chance at life. Try not too die to quickly, and remember to check your magazine. You can also modify your sights and give out commands. There are a variety of classes to choose from. Choose wisely, and don't be afraid to loot corpses; they don't need anything anymore anyway.Stay away from windows. There is also a morale system, where you slowly lose your mind if you are under a barrage of enemy rounds, or if you see an ally get half of their face blown off and fall to the ground screaming in agony for a good minute or so before bleeding out. The result is blurred and discolored sight. I think I got this when I saw a guy get his legs shot off and watched him crawl about an inch away from cover before getting taken out by a sniper.Stay away from windows.In all seriousness, this game has a great deal of work put into detail and animations, but there remain some optimization issues. They're not bad, and a someone with an excellent PC might never even notice them.Rising Storm and Red Orchestra 2 have different dynamics, although the mechanics are exactly the same, if that makes any sense. If there is one thing I have to ABSOLUTELY give this game credit for, is that it has a personality. A very grim personality, but it's better than the typical ""♥♥♥♥ yeah"" jingoism many games go for.There is nothing more satisfying than watching an enemy tank blow to bits.The singleplayer is good practice, but the AI is really ditzy. The soldiers do not show a lot of initiative and tanks commanders seem to forget that tanks can't climb walls.Also, about the window thing: I was waiting for my squad to move up and about seven of them decided march right in front of a window in a factory. A machine gunner across the chasm opened up on them and killed them all. It was really unpleasant to watch them panic and stumble and run into each other while being shot to pieces.

												Red Orchestra 2 is pretty cool, I guess. I mean, if you like having post traumatic stress disorder.RO2:RS:MTV, is the sequel to Red Orchestra, which in turn is a sequel to an Unreal tournament 2004 mod called Red Orchestra, which in turn is a prequel to Battlefield: bad company 2: Vietnam. The game takes place during WW2, a time in history when it was okay to wear a fedora, and it was only this time, so cut it out. Red Orchestra 2 focuses heavily on multiplayer, which is bad for me because that means I have to talk to people, which is bad for them because they can't understand meth induced slurring. Even with its multiplayer focus, the game manages to carry a narrative, and that narrative is ""We should probably stop having these wars, guys.""The game takes no liberties with the horrors that are war, screams of pain are constant, cries for mercy will haunt you, and realism mode is so immersive you can smell the vodka off Gregor's breath.For Christ sakes Gregor, brush your teeth you crazy Ivan. The game is not about ideologies, you won't be getting a Medal of Honor type story about how country A saved the world from country B. The game is about soldiers, the men who fought and died in the worlds biggest game of finger points. Bang Bang. None of the four factions involved are idolized or demonized. The game also has nation specific voices, so Germans speak German, Russians speak Russian, Americans speak American, and the Japanese speak in some language I've never heard of. Though I managed to pick up on some of their phrases. Like ""Tuskete"" means ""Help me."" and ""Banzai"" means ""Put on some 3D glasses, because I'm coming right at you."" But that aside, with all the blood and carnage and butt stabbing. Is the game fun to play? I would say yes.It's an acquired taste, like beer or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It makes no efforts into easing in the casual crowed, or as I like to call them: the weak. It demands that you learn how to play it, it demands that you work together with your new virtual cartoon pals, and it demands that you learn how to use the rod that makes bullets magically appear to kill the people you're pointing at. I call them bang sticks. There is also a multiplayer campaign mode, which is probably the coolest idea a multiplayer game has had since Chromehounds, or Mech assault, or Armored Core. I would like more robots in my games please, but I digress. Players join a server and choose a side, this will be your side unless you're a filthy traitor and go turn coat. It adds a fictional narrative to a game about a real war, like American Marines defending Iwo Jima from a massive Japanese counter attack, or Russians once again fighting in Stalingrad against Super Hitler and his army of Nazi Zombies.Somebody should a game about that, that sounds pretty cool, but I don't think Nazi Zombies™ would catch on. Should you play Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad: Rising Storm: Flags of our Fathers: Gods and Generals: The Reckoning: Army of the Dead: Escape from LA: The Simpsons Movie?I give it two thumbs up, It's a familiar formula while feeling completely different. It will turn off the more casual video game players, but who needs them anyway? This game is for manly men, like me, just me really. I give it 2 Vietnam war flash backs, out of 2. The plastic nubs on the end of shoe laces are called aglets. Their true purpose is sinister. Oh yeah, and I got one of those Curator things now. I update it from time to time, and when I do I usually regret updating it, but here you go.http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation ",283,25,4,43,14,2,59

												Day 1 - We deployed to the Eastern Front a week ago. Heinrich took some shrapnel in his arm, but he'll be alright. He got sent home. Progress is fast. We're pushing out the Bolsheviks at a large rate. We're at the gates of Stalingrad.Day 4 - We've pushed past the defenses. Casualties were high... Johann didn't make it. Neither did Albert. Johann got shot by one of their sharpshooters. None of us were able to get to him. He bled to death... Albert got killed by a grenade. At least his death was quicker and more merciful.Day 5 - Got a letter from my mother back home. Heinrich is recovering well, but will not be returning. The shrapnel severed ligaments in his arm. The men are glad to hear that he doesn't have to come back. This place is really going to hell very quickly...Day 13 12:00 - We were ordered to take a train station yesterday. Close quarters fight. Very nasty. Albrecht got his skull crushed by a Soviet using his rifle as a club. Saw another boy, no older than 19, gutted with one of their spike bayonets. He lied there on the floor crying for his mother as his intestines were spilling out.....what are we even doing here?Day 13 17:21 - Soviet counter-attack. Three more of the original squad died today in an artillery bombardment. Two died from more close quarters brawls. We repelled the attack... but at too high of a cost, in my opinion. I would suggest that we destroy the tracks at multiple points and abandon the area... it holds no real tactical value anyway. Operative word being ""would."" I'd rather not get shot by ""Herr General"" for ""cowardice, defeatism, and insubordination.""Day 21 - Replacements finally arrived. Is it just me, or are they accepting them younger? We were pushed out of the train station. We have no plans to take it back... yet.Day 22 - Tomorrow we're supposed to attack somewhere... they didn't tell us where yet.Day 23 - We took the hill called ""Mamayev Kurgan."" This place holds no strategic value at all... why did we take it? ""Because we can."" ...No members of the original squad are left except for myself and Karl. I had a grenade explode no more than 5 feet away from me. How am I still alive? I'm getting tired.Day 26 - More replacements have shown up. I'm not even going to bother to learn their names anymore. They just get killed... The Soviets across the park keep playing their anthem over loud speakers. The ones that are closer to us are yelling at us, presumably insults. We insult back.Day 29 - We're holed up in an abandoned, bombed out, apartment building.Day 30 08:16- I saw the funniest thing. Last night, a Soviet was trying to sneak a teenage girl into where they were hiding out. Don't want to think about why. They came under machinegun fire from their own men, who thought they were some of us trying to scout their position. They were both killed. ...It looked like they were dancing when they were getting shot at. Not actual dancing, but like when one of those cartoon characters ""dance"" when shot at.Day 30 19:07 - I take it back. The funniest thing I've seen today is a dead horse. I don't know why I found it funny... but I laughed.Day 31 - I want to go home...			",242,11,6,31,22,3,40

												I played this for three hours, went to work, someone dropped a plate and I♥♥♥♥♥♥myself.Now for the actual review.Regardless of any technical issues, this game is a truly underrated multiplayer experience. It is a beautiful perspective that can put you first person inside of a tank when an explosion hits, and you look around to find your commander missing. You later discover that your commanding officer's leg is now sitting in your lap, and realize the task that you must now complete while down a man. You may be traveling through the trenches only to have your buddy get his head ripped apart by a sniper round, while the lower body of your team's sniper flies right past you. Sure there are some glitches and bugs, but this game is truly different from any other fps in that you feel as if you're actually in the action, losing your friends to snipers and grenades. ""When your squad falls around you, it's up to you to hold that position until reinforcements arrive. It doesn't matter how many times you've been hit, what percentage of your friend's body is intact, or how many men are trying to kill you. It's when you see dwindling numbers on your team's resupply that you realize how many men have died for you, and so you better do them proud. But when the count reaches zero, it's time to make your final stand.""                                                                                              -Lt. Woofel, Squad Leader One, Red ArmyStability 6/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 9/10Immersion 10/10Realism 10/10Reinforcements remaining 0/800For anyone who wants to read a story about a valient battle and sacrifice, keep going. I'm just going to rant on about how much fun I've had with this game.Our Russian army had decided to take the Bridges of Druzhnia (I think thats spelled right) against an overwhelmeng German force. The initial assault on A and B lasted nearly fourteen minutes and cost us nearly 150 reinforcements. Further attacks up past D and E cost us an additional hundred. Fueled by our losses, my Squad headed the assault on G, when the roar of The Buzzsaw was heard from the upstairs window. Rushing forward, we made it to the wall but at the cost of six good men. I sent my men on a dual flank before tossing a grenade through the upstairs window, watching as the LMG fell from the window followed by a grey-sleeved arm. Our Commander linked up with our group and commended us for our actions, before pushing us onward. The success of our assault with minimal casualties earned us a feared reputation and a simple, yet accurate nickname: Alpha Squad.At this time, we quickly rushed our assault forward and knocked out the next positions with ease, until we came to the final bridge, section N. Fifteen minutes remained on the clock, and only a hundred of our reinforcements were still alive. We recieved an order from our commanding officer to halt, and recieved the most motivational speech of all time, as we prepared to fight against all odds. Once all of our teams were strategically placed, we recieved the final order to charge the position from three sides.The following events took place over approximately ninety seconds:Our original plan failed catastrophically. Our initial force was obliterated within seconds by the enemy artillery and machine guns. Two unnamed members of Alpha Squad plus myself and our MG moved underneath the bridge to hit with a surprise attack so that our engineer could take out the tank traps. The enemy fire was too intense however, so our engineer only had time to deploy the charges before a Buzzsaw across the river cut him down. During this time, our sniper and commander were to be located on our side of the bridge, laying down cover fire, but they were no match for the German beast and were forced to get into cover. The other four members of my squad were not so lucky, as they had just seen the flash before it ripped them to pieces.While the suppressing group was pinned and taking heavy fire, the Germans brought their Antitank rifles out to take down our T34. However, my smoke grenade had impaired their ability to properly aim, and so fortunatley most of the shots missed the tank. However, the sniper was hit by one of these stray rounds - his body was only partially recovered. I felt tremendous guilt over the loss of a friend, but continued to push onward.Our CO got right up in the action, using the tank as moving cover while he laid down fire with his PPSH. When that was empty, he simply tossed it to the side and pulled out his revolver. After being hit and bandaged three times; a shot to the right arm, one in the leg and another in the stomach; he was on the verge of dying. In his love for the mother country, he pulled out a grenade and rushed forward, taking two more Germans with him.Our MG gunner used the distraction to set his position and took out seven Germans, including their Commanding Officer before a grenade landed just behind him. The explosion took off both of his legs and killed him outright, along with the other two soldiers that were coming up behind us. The blast also crippled my left arm, and in a fit of rage over my dying comrades, I didn't bother to bandage it. Being the final surviving member of the most elite fighters on the Eastern Front, I rushed forward with my PPSH, fully loaded with 71 rounds. It was my job to make sure that the tank made it to the final position, regardless of the cost. While firing at the exposed Germans, a sniper caught me in the chest with a single shot, which I immediatly knew would be fatal. The screen slowly faded to black, but my final breaths would not go silently. I died with my finger still squeezing the trigger, finishing off two more jackboots that tried to stop our desperate assault. Our sacrifice was minimal compared to the 800 Russians that were lost in the assault, but it had allowed enough time for our final remaining men to capture the position and win the game.In memory of:Your Local Soviet - Commander of the Red Army - Grenade SacrificeWoofel - Commander of Squad One ""Alpha Squad"" - Sniper round to the chestjpstorf - Alpha Squad MG - Enemy Grenadethewayneman - Alpha Squad Engineer - ""The Buzzsaw""FatheadPanda126 - Alpha Squad Sniper - Stray AT roundSix Unnamed Soldiers of Alpha Squad - Enemy Grenade, ""The Buzzsaw""800 Brave Red Army Soldiers(Obviously this is a dramatization, but this is basically how I felt during the entire game)More dramatic quotes about Alpha Squad:""Although the Red Army was pushed back to the top floor of the grain elevator with only twenty men remaining against the two hundred Germans, we would fight to the death to hold our positions.

												Bought this game on sale for 9,99 thinking: ""9,99 is ok, even if it's not the ultimate game"".Installed the game,first map - spawned, where is the enemy ? - got shoot - respawned - where do i have to go ? - got shoot - respawned - saw an enemy in front of me with an MG - died.After some 20 to 30 hours dying my way through rounds on maps like grainelevator where i couldn't even figure out where the capzone was i started to get some kills. Yeah i get 10 kills on a map, I am the king !!Omg,what's that? This XXX-guy got 145 kills on the same map  ? - Cheater !!!!!Some 50 hours later i improved my KD Ratio from 1:24 to 1:11, i got 45 kills on the map, I started to know some useful spots, but unfortunately i was not the only one to know them and this XXX-guy cheater still keeps on killing me.I got  45 kills, i am the Greatest, but ♥♥♥♥,  he is still on his 145 kills, i will have to improve myself.200 hours played, maybe the XXX-guy was not cheating as i just got 147 kills on the map and killed him 8 times this round, haha campernoob :-DI add him to my friendslist and he accepts, now we can do more damage together because teamplay is the key in this game. This game is not about the kills, is about the ability to play as a team, to move to the capzone, to work together to defeat the enemy and kills are just a way to get to the objective of defeating the enemy.Sure it's a hardcore game where you have to use cover and not just rush with your 69,99 special edition super gold extra armor and kill everyone with your 59,99 special thermal 10x optics supershotgun rocketlauncher.If you are looking for such a game, don't buy this one.But if you like challenges (like dying permanently the first 20 hours without ragequiting the game), if you like realistic firefights (1shoot kill, slow reload times, heavy MG fire, suppression, tactics) this game is for you.The community is (except a few) great and very helpfully and most of people who have passed the 100 hours limit stay on this game for thousands of hours.And Triwire is still updating the game with new maps or adding new weapons or vehicles (still tank fight is very limited in ths game, 95% infantry)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the most detailed and polished WWII game on the market today. No shooter can honestly live up to Red Orchestra 2. The aimin/shooting mechanic is pure GENIUS! It's totally unique in it's own right and will give you a brand new outlook on what a FPS can be!Now, Red Orchestra 2 is not an easy game. This is not CoD... I actually feel ashamed and embarassed to even mention ""that"" game on the same screen. If you rage at ""that"" game then, you might possibly pop a vein or break your keyboard while playing multiplayer in RO2. But, this is what makes RO2 so damn addicting: it's VERY rewarding to hit, let alone kill, somebody... or just simply staying alive. Red Orchestra 2 is in a league of it's own. It's the most immersive war experience I've ever witnessed in a game. If you enjoy shooters then you should definitely buy the game... IMMEDIATLY!! Or... you could maybe find a demo. Either way,  you will not regret it!			",81,4,10,8,9,0,5

												It's really hard to believe this game was released in 2011. Literally impossible. It's 2016, and the WWII games aren't even near this game. This is what WWII games of 2016 should hope to achieve. This level of simulation is unbelieveable. Multiplayer controlled tanks. Mind blown!

												My most memorable moment in this game was probably when my friend and I went ahead and decided to learn how to drive a tank in the midst of battle.When we spawned in, our tank crew went as follows: My friend as the driver, me as the person manning the tank's actual gun, and a random person operating the machine gun. Our crash-course, self-led tutorial basically consisted of my friend driving in circles because he could hardly see anything out of the driver's slit; me not being able to shoot the gun properly because the tank was constantly moving, resulting in tank shells being fired haphazardly around; and the machine gunner, who knew what he was doing, yelling at us and calling us incompetent idiots. I proceeded to accidentally pop my head out through the tank's top, only to instantaneously be shot. My dead body slumped back into the tank cockpit and awkardly jostled there as everything in the tank was suddenly painted with my blood. I can imagine Russian soldiers peeping out of their foxholes, only to comically spectate a German tank spin around, firing randomly and carelessly.Later in the siege, our commander called in artillery on friendly positions and we lost.I think they actually kill employees to record the game's death screams. Red Orchestra 2 can easily be named 'PTSD Simulator 1942.' Seriously, though. This game is great. Easily one of the best World War II shooters I've ever played. Shots kill you instantly (If you're lucky enough to survive a bullet, you usually just sit in sadness as you listen to your character scream or cry to death as they bleed out), the carnage feels authentic and the atmosphere is truly war-like. The developers really harped on realism, and I can say they nicely achieved it. That's not to mention the soundtrack is proud and patriotic, while at the same time solemn and depressing.The only problems I can think of is the game are its graphics-intensive nature, so you need a decent computer to run it, and the game is so structured around teamwork that an incompetent team can really rain on your gameplay experience (Or boost it, depending on the scenario).

												Red Orchestra 2 is a brilliant multiplayer team-based fps that made me remember why I love the genre. Based on the Battle of Stalingrad at the Eastern Front of WW2, the game is remarkable in it's attention to detail and authenticity.The weapon handling/mechanics feel great, as do the ballistics. This coupled with the realistic level of damage players receive, makes for a highly rewarding combat system. The feeling of successfully rooting out a Sniper or MG with one well-placed shot, and freeing up your team's advance is incredible.This is a game in which teamwork is paramount, the attacking team must capture and sometimes destroy objectives to advance to victory. This is facilitated (in theory) by the Commander and Squad Leaders, who each have an extremely important role to play. The Commander has access to radios located in various spots around the map. From these, he can call recon planes to check enemy movement, force respawns and call artillery strikes which can turn the momentum of a game completely. A good Commander is a necessity, as he will stategize on the fly, give the Squad Leaders and their teams objectives to complete and decimate enemy reinforcements with artillery. The Squad Leaders need to know their stuff, as they posses the means to mark artillery targets in the form of binoculars and also serve as a mobile spawn point. Above all else the Squad Leaders job is to mark artillery targets for the Commander when asked, and to stay alive close to the objective. This allows for a constant stream of attackers to keep the pressure on the enemy, before he becomes entrenched. There are 12 different squad roles in RO2, depending on the map being played and whether there is a tank present. The most common roles are Rifleman, Elite Rifleman, Assault, Elite Assault, Marksman, Machine Gunner, Squad Leader and Commander. On maps with a tank there will also be roles related to tank operation and destruction. Each of these classes have a specific role to play, most of which is pretty self-explanatory. When a team is working together cohesively with a competent Commander and good Squad Leaders, it is one of the most intense and enjoyable games I have ever played. RO2 is a game that takes a lot of time and effort to learn, and to a new player it can seem very overwhelming and difficult. If you are new to RO2, my best advice would be to role-play as a soldier in WW2. If you were in that situation, would you run across a street covered by an MG or into an artillery strike? If you treat your life as valuable, use cover, check your approach and move as a team you are much more likely to succeed.This game definitely had a terrible launch, and suffers from some clunky mechanics and strange glitches (being stuck in between crouch and prone is a personal fav). While some of these issues will be enough to turn some people off, those that persevere will find a unique, rewarding and immensely satisfying game. With the constant stream of awesome community-made maps and the addition of Rising Storm, I couldn't recommend it more highly.

												I loved popsicles. My favorite was pineapple, and it just looked like an icicle.I was crouching in the trenches. Ivans were all around, but they were good huntin'. A younger soldier, Wilhelm, crouched by a nearby icicle-covered box. I talk with him; he tells me about his sweetheart, and how proud his parents are of him for going to war. I laugh and tell him about my parents.Suddenly, a rifle cracks. Wilhelm falls to the ground, clutching his chest. I get out of the trench and run over to him.It's too late. He's lost too much blood.""Everything's... going dark..."" He whisperred, coughing up blood.""Mama... Mama, I'm scared..."" He says, before he goes limp.I can hear the Russians closing in. I get to my feet, clutching my rifle, tears and cold stinging my eyes.I fire. And fire. And fire.*Click* goes my gun. But there are still Russian soldiers. I fumble with my ammo, but it's too late.I fall to the snow, moaning in pain. I see an artillery strike coming over the sky as my world fades to black.My mom comes home. I get off the computer.

												Get on the 50 cal. Johnson! That's an order! Uhh, Sarge' I think Johnson is dead. Don't give me any lip private, you get Johnson on that 50 cal. and throw his god damned corpse on it if you have to! Of course this scene instantly snapped back to me as soon as I started up Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad. I saw the vivid picture of my entire squad being picked off one by one. It was a gruesome Friday night and we lost many good souls that match. If only, if only we had more respawn points we could have pushed back those Kraut ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. As soon as the memory fades I alt-tab out. I can't do it anymore. Maybe, I'll go mine some diamonds or something....This game is not for the faint-hearted. If you're prone to frequent war flash backs or can't stand being around constant virtual death I recommend you seek elsewhere for your video entertainment needs. Pick up RO2: HoS if you think you can handle the horrors of war.			",103,4,1,18,9,0,28

												This game, is an absolutely amazing game. It is set in and around Stalingrad, where the Germans and the Russians face off for victory. It is also set in and around the South-East Asian-Pacific region, where the Japanese and the Americans face off for victory. It is brutally realistic and gritty. A bullet from most weapons to the torso will kill you most of the time, same to the kneck or head. To the arms or legs most of the time it will wound you. Even if you are not killed after being wounded, if the wound is anywhere other than your limbs, you must patch yourself fast or you will bleed out, just like in reality. If it is in your limbs you may or may not bleed out, sometimes you have to judge if its better to run to cover and then heal, or heal on the spot and hope you don't get shot again. Or maybe you don't need to heal at all and you can save your bandages for worse wounds. The weapons have realistic recoil, and clear advantages and disadvantages for all situations. The Germans favor medium to long range fighting, the Russians medium to short range. The Germans and Russians are both perfectly capable of attacking and defending, but the Germans have an edge when it comes to attacking due to having longer ranged weapons, the only assault rifle in the world at the time, and machine guns with very high rates of fire that are very good for pinning the enemy down. The Russians have an edge on defense due to being good at letting the enemy come to them and grinding them down in close quarters fighting, along with the superior PPSH 41 sub machine gun, and superior mosin nagant bolt action rifle with its amazing accuracy that can blow the enemy away at close range even with sloppy aiming. Basically, some weapons for one side are superior to the other's equivalent. The audio in this game is stunning and extremely intense, much better than other shooters. This game is also extremely reliant on team work, no one-man armies allowed. If one team is communicating and working together, and the other is not, then the team that is working together will crush the other one. If both are doing what they are supposed to be doing then you get incredibly intense matches. The Rising Storm side of the game is pretty different from the Stalingrad part, for example Asymmetric warfare plays a huge role. The Japanese cannot face off against the Americans head on in open areas, the Americans just have too much fire power. The Japanese need to utilize the environment to keep mobility over the enemy and to take cover, jungle fighting is where they excell. All of the American riflemen have semi-automatic rifles, something neither the Japanese, nor the Germans or Russians get to have for their riflemen, and riflemen make up the bulk of the team. All of the other American classes have gear with superior raw damage and rates of fire to that of the Japanese, but what the Japanese excell at is their ferocity, combined with ingenious things such as creating frag grenade booby traps, knowing when to keep their distance so as to pick the enemy off from long range with their more accurate and longer range bolt action rifles, their knee mortars, and banzai charging in a small area in a big spearhead with smoke grenades and mortar/artillery/naval barrage support. The Japanese are definitely more geared towards attacking so as to hit the Americans on their terms and to overwhelm them in massed attacks, whereas the Americans, due to their superior raw fire power, are best on defense because they can dig in and if the Japanese run around in open areas they can mow them down like German machine guns on D-Day (Saving private Ryan style)And speaking of D-Day, there is currently a 1944-1945 US vs German mod in development with testing events every few days, which will be like a fan made expansion which will bring the game up to 3 different theaters. And on top of that a World War I mod is in the early stages of development with both western and eastern front gameplay.There are no hackers whatso ever, there are some modded maps that are optional to play on, and the vast majority of the player base are cool people, who don't mess around, are not casual, and who play to win, all of which creates an extremely intense gaming experiance.This game is one of the best games I have ever played, and I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone.It's way better than what Call of Duty and Battlefield have turned into.

""THE WEHRMACHT SENDS ITS BEST REGARDS TO YOUR FAMILY""Back in late 2011 it wasn't really popular ""one hit - one kill"" in FPS or any other genre. If you think about what games was out before and at that time, you'll know. When Red Orchestra 2 was presented, developers has been talking a lot about being killed by single bullet, about realism and how very close the game will be to the real battlefield. I cannot put single reviews on multi and singleplayer because they do not have separate store pages so it will be all in this one. When it came out, you really had to be impressed. Gamers really like that idea and multiplayer was at its top. Lot of people and magazines said that it's over BF or CoD. However, that praise was just multiplayer related.MULTIPLAYER: Players asked for realistic combat and real atmosphere of battlefields and feel the power (or weakness) of regular soldier. And well, guess what, we got it. During the prime times, the MP was full of tactics and strategy even when you played completely with random people. You'll really need to think twice about your movement and where you go, because when you do Rambo style, well, you die. Various weapons and different types of play style, really hard enviroment made the multiplayer one of the best out here. SINGLEPLAYER: As I said in the beginning, all the praise was only for multiplayer. Singleplayer is absolutely horrible. One of the worst I ever did. Main reason is that AI is totally terrible. The game is supposed to be hard but in reality it is far from being hard. I've completed the campaign of both Soviet and Nazi on Hero and the real struggle was defense missions only. Rest is so easy due to AI that I can't even imagine how it'd be on Easy difficulty. Campaign is really short, it took me 7 hours (above the review is different time because Steam is tracking multiplayer time for this Store Page) to finish it and get all the achievements. Whole game was really repetetive and intros into the missions was annoying rather than being useful or give you any motivation. Except tank missions whole campaign was about same objectives and boring as hell. RISING STORM: Really don't have much to say. Stand-alone expansion to RO2 brings you the Pacific battlefields. Great new weaponry and intense maps with combination of well-known RO2 mechanism is great combination. Good fact - it is within the RO2 bundle and is not separated no more. Did Red Orchestra 2 stand the test of time? Most definitely.Bonus Point: PacificRating: 8/10-----------------------------------------Single-Player - 4/10Multi-Player - 8/10Rising Storm - 9/10			",105,13,6,7,13,1,6

												Prologue: NO I IN TEAM.Some of the best moments I've ever had playing video games came during the era of Battlefield 2 + 2142. For me, the introduction of Commanders and Squad Leaders - with points granted for following orders - was something entirely unique. Working in tandem with a bunch of strangers, usually without the use of a mic, with the single goal of victory in mind, generated a greater sense of accomplishment through victory than the pursuit of a positive kill / death ratio. Unfortunately, the playing community on these games has dwindled, while the likes of Call of Duty, with its multi-platinum sales, has dictated the way in which EA has demanded DICE produce further editions of the series. Truly there was a gap in the market, with the only alternative fps that would cater for me being Counter Strike; which in itself was an entirly different animal. There may have been alternatives I didn't know about, namely the first Red Orchesta, but this was a game that never came onto my radar.Fast forward a few years as the numbers dwindled on the 2142 servers, forcing me to find an alternative. After some minor research, I syumbled upon Red Orchestra 2, and what can I say, it ticked every box including ones I didn't realise existed or even needed ticking. If Battlefield 2 / 2142 encouraged team-play, RO2 demanded it; always will a well disciplined team, of average players, armed with an intelligent Commander reign victorious over a team of brilliant individualists. Of course, the game does give perks for team work, such as extra points for assist kills and defending cap zones etc. but lacking these bonuses, team-work would still be the back-bone of this game as the player-base knowingly understand it is the only way defeat can be avoided, even if it doesn't necessarily guarantee success, as the opposition will more than likely fight fire with fire.General Pros and Cons:PROS: #More mature player-base - having kids flame out on VoIP is an extreme rarity.#Campaign mode - a more involved an enlongated way to sew map victories together, as each team vies to hold each territory by succesfully attacking and defending on the campaign map.#Map Design - Sure the player limit is capped at 64 & the maps are usually quite large - Bridges of Druzinha springs to mind - but the fact only one or two objectives are ever in play means the action is condensed into one section of the map. While player respawns act as single waves coming from a relatively sizable distance away. The pace of a packed server is quite remarkable, with each contol point always within 1 good attack from falling.#Vehicles - Despite a couple of 'tank only' maps (which are avoided like the plague by the community) the maps only ever have one tank per side; one tank for the attacking team - to add some balance - or none at all. This keeps the infantry as the most relevant forces on the map, which should be the case in a FPS; while keeping a wild card in the pot at all times if not dealt with appropriatly.#Team Balance - Both the Germans and the Russians have their strong and weak points. The Assault class is probably the most varried between the two armies, so I will talk about the differences a little. The PPS SMG for the Russians is unparalleled in close quarters and can take out entire squads with a rapid firing of bullets; however, when engaging anything over 50 meters it quickly becomes far less useful than the German Mp40. While, the Germans have access to the mk42b (arguably the games best all-rounder) for experienced Elite Assault troops. Like I said with pretty much every other class, the difference in guns in negligable. This minor differences means that certain maps are delibaretly avoided or chosen in Campaign mode, as it may bring out the best in a particular weapon - namely the over-powering of the PPS in the level Appartments.Furthermore, each team can only have certain amounts of each player type, meaning that more than half of the battleground consists of regular rifleman armed with a bolt action non-scoped rifle - amplifyig the importance of knowing how to play your class.#Fair leveling system - Most the upgrades awarded for leveling up provide major upgrades for extremely situational circumstances; bigger magazines for an smg or a bayonette for a rifle. This means that a lvl1 private entering the game for the first time doesn't have to be out-gunned while he builds up a feel and understanding of the game, while it also provides an incentive for experienced players to level all the available classes. The only exception really comes with the sniper classes, who can swap out their bolt-action rifles for semi-auto rifles afer leveling up enough - although if it takes you multiple shots as a sniper, you're doing it wrong - or indeed the German Elite Assault class, who can unlock the games only Assault Rifle the MK42b - but on the flip side the Russians will have unlocked the drum magazine for their pps at this stage, which can inflict unimaginable carnage in certain circumstances.#Steam Workshop - Addons provided by the community for free, what's not to like?CONS:#Realistic damage - a positive in my eyes, but I know people have complained about the inability to fire back at an aggressor. Nine times out of ten, spotting the enemy before they spot you means they will be the one filled with bullets. A good knowledge of the map layout aswell as ensuring the team has secured the flanks is of paramount importance.#No weapon points for leaving a round - Annoyingly, if you leave a game prior to the end of a round, any of the points that you would have gathered for leveling up your weapons will be lost. Not too big of an issue you would think, but maps like Bridges of Druzihna have a one hour time limit, so you could lose 45 mins of good progress because real-life kicks in.#Steep learning curve - Unlike some games which have beginner only servers, RO2 will not hold your hand at all, meaning that learning the intricacies of the game can be a grind which leaves your character in the grave more times than you would have liked.The fact each team only has a set number of 'premium' classes also means that if it is clear you do not know how to play one of these roles, you'll be a considerable liability for your team. The only way of getting comfortable with a role is either through the games atrocious single-player campaign, or by spending time on a server populated solely by bots (there are many), just so your learning experience doesn't hinder the fun of others. #Auto balance - Some matches can be incredibly one sided, due to team-work over VoIP or better use of Commander or Squad Leaders, and while the game does have an auto-balance feature it rarely pans out that it gets the switches correct.It is a delight to see that Tripwire Interactive didn't cave into the pressure that was created by the rise of the modern console twitch-based shooter, ala Call of Duty. This game is a gem, that may not appeal to everyody, but certainly fills a gaping hole in the market that was brought on by a barrage of sub-par fps games. Indeed since its release there have been a few more gems that cater to a similar audience, none more so than the RO2 add-on Rising Storm, which is based on the Pacific Theater of WW2. It keeps much of the same gameplay mechanics, while injecting it with a completely different pace through level-design and weapon variation; meaning it offers enough of a change to make it worth the investment while keeping enough of the original so you know you'll like it if you liked RO2. Also, check out Insurgency for similar mechanics on a smaller scale.This is by someway a marked improvement from the games which I had craved, as the team-work aspect is necessary for success; you are more likely to find team driven players on any random server here than during the golden-years of Battlefield.

												When I first opened this game, I thought that I was ready for any role. I hop into a game as the Americans pushing up the beaches of Iwo Jima. A flamethrower is open, so I chose it, thinking that it'd be more fun than a rifleman. I rush up the first part, free of enemies, with my comrades rallying together on all sides of me. We get over the hill and a wall of bullets flies our way, whizzing past me as I serpentine to a nearby crater. I crouch for cover and check my surroundings to see that only 5 of the 20 people that was around me had made it with me to this crater. Three are patching themselves while another stumbles around and bleeds out slowly from a gutshot. The fourth clears the barbed wire in front of our crater with a satchel charge. The Japs are focused on other soldiers as we try to run up to their trench. The engineer was in front of me and body-blocked a rifle shot for me. Another friend takes out the guy who shot him while I wiped my friend's blood off of me. We all dive to the ground as a mounted MG starts firing on us and we spend the next two minutes crawling up to the trench. Once there, I sprayed the entire trench without looking and hopped over once the bullets stopped. First, I felt satisfied...until I saw their charred bodies still twisting and turning from my flames. I stood in shock in the trench as I realized just how much suffering I caused, as evident from their blood-curdling screams. My SL screams out ""Sniper! Get Down!"" just as I fall to the ground after seeing the sniper's scope glint. I fell down staring into the eyes of a charred Jap with embers still going on his peeling skin. I left the game and went to sleep. That night, I had nightmares of the event previously described. I woke up sweating and still haven't picked up that class since that night.10/10 would get PTSD for a night again			",112,7,0,7,6,1,1

												One of the best if not the best FPS game I have ever played then it comes to realism. The devs still support the game even after all these years and makes new content to it. The game is still really active and you can easily find full server with 64 people on it. I would really recommend this game if you like games with alot of realism in them.

Posted: July 9, 2016
												This is going to be one of those long reviews, so I'll start with a short overview. If you only want a short review, just read that.Buy this game. It's great. It feels great, controls smooth, looks quite good, has a great atmosphere, some good communities scattered in there, and it takes skill, teamwork, and tactics to play well, but not at the expense of tension or gameplay. It's not quite as realistic as Arma, but it's so much more tense and immersive. It's my FPS dream come true. Okay, now comes the long bit.Red Orchestra isn't a perfect simulation of war, but it feels so real, the sense of fear is so palpable, the triumph of finally getting good and learning to hit moving targets, of finally learning how to handle yourself in a combat situation so that you can kill as many of the enemy as possible -  that  is better than any milsim's realism.Somebody once asked me if Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm is as hard as they'd heard. Here's what I told them.""Let me put it to you this way.It's not too difficult to learn how to shoot accurately. Not getting shot is the difficult part. You have to learn to check every corner of every room that you enter. Check the ceiling if the building is more than one story, since there are often holes in the second floor. Become obsessive about checking for the enemy. It'll keep you alive longer. Not forever, though. Why would you want to live forever? Make your inevitable death mean something. Never cross open ground if you can avoid it. Move from cover to cover when there is some, which is rare enough, and when there isn't, you'd better hope your squad leader hasn't thrown his smoke grenade yet, because the enemy machine gunner 100 meters away whose muzzle flash is the only thing you can see as your buddy's stomach turns into a large-caliber hole, well, that enemy is going to cut you to pieces if you don't have a smokescreen up. If you see the enemy and you're moving, you're dead already, so don't worry about learning to stop moving and respond.Shooting accurately is easy if you know when to shoot. Don't try to shoot when you aren't behind some sort of cover. Make sure that it's actual solid cover and not just a piece of corrugated metal or a bush, because bullets go through those, and your muzzle flash will give you away. There's no crosshair. To shoot from the hip and get a kill, you have to be up close and personal, good, in possession of a full-auto weapon, and very lucky. Don't shoot from the hip if you can avoid it. Use your iron sights. No scope for you, unless you earn it with the blood of thousands of enemies. If you've been sprinting for too long, your weapon sways and you can't hit anything. Bullets drop, and they travel at something like 800m/s, though it varies from weapon to weapon, so you have to lead your target (the amount you lead by varies from weapon to weapon as well for the aforementioned reason) and adjust the zeroing on your rear sight if you want your bullets to go anywhere near where you point your weapon. If you are a rifleman, your job is not just to kill the enemy, but to die so that the guy behind you can figure out the location of the enemy who killed you and kill him, making the next 10 meters clear for your squad to advance. The needs of your team outweigh your life. Get used to it.So you're sure you're in a good firing position. Now line up the shot. Lining up the shot is easy if you can see the enemy. Seeing the enemy is hard. You look for a slightly darker shade of gray or brown in a gray-brown hell that is of no real strategic importance, but your orders are to fight for it anyway, so you do. You look for a slightly different shade of green in a sweltering jungle which has already given you malaria and has rotted your uniform to tatters. If you can see the enemy, assume they can see you. Don't move. The human eye picks up movement much better than it does a slight difference in color. Wait for your chance. Shoot. Wait to see the blood, but as soon as you do, move. You've given away your position. Find a new one.So you've lined up the shot. It's not difficult to line up the shot if you can do all these things and survive long enough. Pulling the trigger is harder at first. I used to miss on purpose every so often, when I was new to the game. I'm a pacifist in real life, and thought I was doing good, since we're all just scared boys trying to survive in a meat grinder. But no. I've seen too many of my friends die to miss on purpose now. I've been through too much♥♥♥♥♥♥Everybody around you is going to die. You've accepted this. You're going to die. You're never going to make it home again. But you want to stay alive as long as possible, for some sick, twisted, perverted reason. Part of you would rather die. You've seen men screaming for their mothers as they writhe around in puddles of their blood, staring with soulless eyes at their mangled limbs and exposed intestines. There's no time for a man to be incredulous when he realizes he will never use his legs or genitals again even if he survives. There's only time for pain.God, you want it to end. But something keeps pushing you onwards, forcing you to do whatever it takes to survive even though you'd rather end it all before the enemy does, because it's all going to end soon anyway. The enemy will never make it home again either. They're all going to die. What does it matter if you happen to kill one of them? From the moment he was assigned to this front, he was dead. You are just the man holding the rifle that causes his death. Somebody else would kill him if you didn't, and maybe if you kill him, you and your friends might survive a few minutes longer. You want those few minutes, even though they will only bring pain, terror, and possibly the shell with your name on it that rips off your arm above the elbow and bathes the snow in warm blood that steams as it cools.Prepare to die. You are nobody. You are no longer a gamer. You were never a gamer. You used to be a peasant boy from Siberia who dreams of becoming a novelist. You used to be a butcher's son from Bavaria whose sweetheart has promised to marry him when Russia is defeated. You used to be Horace Mann High School's baseball star who joined the Marines since he wasn't good enough for college ball. You used to be the proud child of an old sword-making family from Nakatsu. You used to be these things, but now you're nobody. You don't have a mouse and keyboard. You used to have a plow, but now you turn over the soil with artillery. You used to have a girl's hand to hold, but now you only caress your rifle. You used to have a baseball you played catch with, but now you play catch with grenades. You used to watch your father slide the swords into cold water to harden them, but now you watch bayonets plunge into the warm entrails of your friends. You are cannon fodder. You're not special. You are a cog in a great machine, a machine that has plenty of other cogs willing to take your place when you are no longer useful. You are just one of 25 million cogs.So, yeah. It's difficult. But be thankful it's not real. For millions, it was.""I cannot recommend this game enough. If you want a story-driven campaign, or good AI, or easy kills, look elsewhere. But give this a shot. It's so damn good. I've never been to war, and I'm so lucky to be able to say that. I'll never kill anybody in real life if I can help it. But this game took me out of my room and put me in the middle of the most brutal war in history better than any tightly-scripted CoD campaign ever could. It's the most immersive game in existence. Try it.			",50,5,0,1,4,0,4

												Great Game and Greater PlayersIt's the best FPS about WW2. I have never seen a game like this before and may won't see another in the future. This game brings you a realistic warfare in the Eastern Front and the Pacific. If you are a military enthusiast, DO NOT miss it.Red Orchestra 2 is a platform where I meet a lot of friends around the world especially from Japan, they are all good guys and game masters. It's my pleasure to play with them.Thank you for all in [JP]Banzai Servers, I will stay here until the end of this game because of you on my side.			",41,8,0,14,11,0,18

												This game is not your typical FPS game. Hardcore modes is punishing wherein one shot one kill can happen a lot of times. Forget your COD skills that will not work on this game. Some word of advice for new players:1. Don't run and Gun2. listen to your Squad Leaders3. Team Leader is vital to winning, if you can't do it let others take the position4. Riflemen are expendable but if you die a lot, your team is gonna drain its tickets.5. Snipers focus on enemy MGs and Squad Leaders6. Squad Leaders should mark enemy spawn points for artillery and lay down once you've done it. You are a walking spawn point, spawn your squad to capture enemy territory.			",34,0,0,3,1,0,3

												A very intense and surreal Multiplayer experience. At times you feel scared and actually pinned down, hoping that something saves you, whether it be a team mate or death. This isn't a game where you can jump in and kill (well you can but you may not get too far) it requires some planning and communication between your team. Overall I recommend it but if you are looking for a singleplayer experience not in Multiplayer, then I wouldn't get it as the Singleplayer doesnt feel at all that amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There I was somewhere in Russia surrounded by a bunch of angry Bolschewik's. Alone in my Schützenloch I thought ""This isn't so bad actually"" then I heard it, ""HURRAH!"" suddenly, a bunch of russians charged at me. Thank the Führer I had my Mg42 with me. As I unloaded my gun on them I shouted that I need fire support on my position. Lukily a SL placed a mark on my Schützenloch. Just as my last mag was empty the Arty came down.

												The following review is for Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm. (both included when buying Rising Storm)Red Orchestra 2 and its stand-alone expansion Rising Storm are World War II military First-person shooters with an emphasis on solid gameplay mechanics and gritty authenticity. While the two differ in gameplay, both are grounded in realism without being marred by unnecessary clunkiness. Both were developed by Tripwire Interactive, the studio that is probably best known for Killing Floor and the original Red Orchestra game. Much like Killing Floor, these games shine most in the way that they feature what are quite possibly the best shooting mechanics that you will find in any video game.These games are by no means ""dead"" as some doom-and-gloom internet posters would have you beleive. Despite featuring a complex set of controls and being fairly unforgiving about deaths in multiplayer, the games do a great job of expressing that the multiplayer expirience is hard but fair. Perceptivness, tactical forsight, and team communication are always heavily rewarding for players willing to go the extra mile. Much of the early criticism for Red Orchestra 2 by popular review sources and Metacritic mainly focus on the game's rough state at launch rather than the game you will be playing today. RO2 and RS have been greatly improved with the help of official patches and updates and even moreso with the help of the player community that is the backbone of the series. Rising Storm offers a new and different expirience to that of Red Orchestra 2. While still featuring the original game's brutality and satisfying gun mechanics, rising storm features more asymetrical gameplay that is more rooted in fast-paced action than the base game. This stand-alone expansion is great for both veterans looking for something fun and different as well as new players that felt intimidated by the heavily punishing nature of RO2's multiplayer. Upon purchasing Rising Storm players will recieve a copy of Red Orchestra 2 if they do not already own it. Red Orchestra 2 owners will be able to play a limited version of Rising Storm and will also recieve a discount when buying the expansion.These games are great for anyone looking for a First-Person shooter with solid gameplay mechanics. Red Orchestra 2 and Rising storm offer a great experience that rivals and even surpasses those offered by AAA FPS titles.**The games are to be appreciated on their own merits rather than to be used to boost one's own ego for not being part of the Call of Duty or Battlefield audience.

												I love Red Orchestra 2, and in particular Rising storm. I'm Japanese and I want to know more about the places where my forefathers fought: Guadalcanal, Peliliu, Tarawa, Burma, the Philippines, Saipan and Iwo Jima course with the Okinawa. Also I am interested to know about weapons of that time. I found out about the Type 89 and Type 100. This game has the most atmospheric maps, I often feel like a soldier in the Imperial Japanese Army. I have never met such a good game about the war in the Pacific. I remember when I bought it, it's the best of the games that I have. But the most remarkable thing in the game - a banzai attack. I heard my grandfather's memories about the Banzai attack, but I could not think how it bravely - run on the enemy machine guns with swords and bayonets.I could feel for myself what it is - to go to the Banzai attack. Banzai attack - that's what the Japanese people different from the other nations of the world.I think if my grandparents decided to remember how they fought, I would have invited them to this game. But the first grandfather died on Okinawa in 1945, and the second died in 2014. I am very proud of them.Okay, let's move on to the pros and cons of this game.+This is the most realistic game about World War II. You can kill with one shot here is missing life bar. There is no minimap in the bottom left corner.+Beautiful maps. So beautiful  that they absorb you completely.+Gameplay. You feel a full participant of hostilities in the Pacific Ocean. When I play, I feel that I will soon be killed soon.+A lot of various weapons. From katana to light mortar and flamethrower. You will find something you like among these weapons diversity. My choice - a Type 38.+Various phrases of soldiers during battle. They give to understand how to feels the soldiers on the front line.+Various phrases of soldiers. You can understand that a soldier feels in the moment.+Banzai attack.-Difficulty. A man came out of games like Battlefield, Call of duty will be difficult to play this game. But you get used to the game after about 50 hours of play in it.-Inadequate players. It is good that these players being kicked from the server.-Small fullness of servers.+-The level of weapon/character. Some players get tired to upgrade his character and weapons, a lot of players throw the game because of this reason, but it suits me and I continue to play. I include this to the minuses and pluses.So I think this is the coolest game of all games about World War II and especially about the war in the Pacific. This game is not expensive. You should play in this game!!!!兵隊さんよありがとう!			",54,10,1,8,8,0,5

YouTube™ Video: Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad [Game Review] 

			Views: 682		

			Here is my review of ""Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad"", a multiplayer first-person shooter set in World War II developed and published by Tripwire Interactive.		

Game: Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of StalingradGenre: Multiplayer First-person ShooterDeveloper: Tripwire InteractivePublisher: Tripwire InteractiveCopy supplied by SteamRed Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad is a multiplayer first-person shooter set in World War II developed and published by Tripwire Interactive.STORYThe main game is set during the invasion of Russia from the Nazis against the Soviets. There is also a standalone game called Rising Storm that features the American attacks against the Japanese after Pearl Harbor. The game doesn't have a real storyline, but the setting feels very grounded in history and there are plenty of real life locations, as well as actual guns and vehicles from the era.GRAPHICSThe game uses Unreal Engine 3. There are your usual texture pop-ins and small performance hiccups, even though there aren't as many as usual. The game olds up fairly well and the decaying cities of Russia are well varied and full of little details that suck you into the experience.GAMEPLAYThe game features a variety of modes, including Territory (where you conquer different places on a map), Firefight (team deathmatch), and a Multiplayer Campaign (which is basically Territory played on multiple levels and stages). The levels are all very well balanced, and both sides feel equally as powerful. The game lacks a crosshair and an ammo count: while it is pretty weird at first, you slowly start seeing that it's the best way to get sucked into the game. There are multiple classes to choose from, each one with its set of items and weapons to use on the battlefield, but in the end the game rewards the most skilled players, and there isn't a weapon more powerful than another: they are all balanced to suite each player to their favourite play style without making them too overpowered. The Squad Leaders work as spawn points, while the Commander has the ability to force respawn and to select sections of the territory to launch an artillery attack or bombardments.I have never felt more paranoid in a game than when playing RO2: whenever you are getting shot at, you lose focus, your vision gets blurry, and you start losing the ability to hear. When crawling through the battlefield with a bunch of comrades, seeing one of the suddenly become a ragdoll fills you with fear of knowing that a sniper is probably loading the next bullet to send to your brain. This are just some of the amazing experiences I've had in this game that in my opinion shows how brutal and unheroic war is: people die, people scream, and in the end each side loses a ton of good soldiers.CHALLENGEThe game features bullet drops and realistic damage: shooting at someone's leg will make him limp, shooting at his lungs will make him grasp for air for a couple of seconds without collapsing... When I started replaying the game for this review, I remembered how unforgiving it is for new players. But if you give it enough time, you will get better at handling weapons and calculating the difference bullet drops as well as the best tactics to win on both sides. It becomes a very rewarding game.SOUNDThe sound is phenomenal, with realistic weapon effects, cheesy but fun voice acting and powerful explosions. The soundtrack is also very underrated, and it homages classic themes from movies like Saving Private Ryan.REPLAYABILITYThe game is constantly being updated by the developers, and the community is pretty great too: many maps and modes can be downloaded from the Workshop to change the game's formula up. There are also over 140 Steam achievements that will keep you hooked for a long time.Overall, Red Orchestra 2 is one of my favourite multiplayer games of all time, as well as a great war game that requires a bit of tactics and good skills. Everyone who enjoys online games and first person shooters as well as more skills than luck will have a blast playing this hard at first but hugely satisfying game.Story: n/aGraphics: 8.5Gameplay: 9.5Challenge: 9Sound: 9.5Replayability: 9ENJOYMENT: 9FRUSTRATION: 7.5Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook{LINK REMOVED}Check my official websiteJoin my Steam group ",532,126,11,40,24,4,34

												If your checking this out and still not sold.. This is probably the most authentic, tactical, and realistic WW2 FPS available. If you put some time in, the learning curve is very rewarding.+ Squad commands - Get on the point!+ Recon radio - reveal enemy positions+ Artillery - 4 types. Spot your target. Radio for mortars, howitzers, rocket barage, or a naval pounding.+ Tanks & APC (operable alone or with crew)+ Mounted machine guns for defense+ Classes available: Team leader, squad leader, engineer, marksman, assault, machine gunner, tank, mortar, flamethrower, and infantry+ Big selection of maps with authentic ww2 locations, terrain, and propaganda posters+ Preset voice commands on quick menu interface (changeable languages)+ Authentic ww2 weapons incl: springfield, kar98, mauser, makarov, ppsh, mp40, mosin nagant, grenades, landmines, bayonets, flamethrowers, katanas! and others.+ Realistic recoil, sound, and bullet drop effects. Adjustable sights for elevation.+ Trench warfare and bunkers+ Eastern front and Pacific theatres: German, Russian, Japanese, American, & British (with mod).+ Can be played alone on an empty server to rank up and unlock weapons and upgrade abilities, if needed.- Some bugs. Most are overcome and certainly not deal breakers.- AI can be frustrating but can often be corrected by squad or team leaders. Take the time to learn those classes, they arevalueable assets in your team.- Some areas on certain maps can't be spotted for artillery by the team leader, this can often be overcome with a spot from a squad leader.- Some graphical bugs when going prone on certain maps- The control or use key is bound by default to too many functions which sometimes conflict- Auto balance issues with limited players- High video settings can crash the game on older systems, some tweaking advised. Probably my favourite game ever, enjoy.			",57,1,2,3,0,0,3

												Warning, you will get one shot a lot playing this game.This game is really good. Basically it's one of, if not, the most realistic FPS I have ever played. The maps are huge and it tries to make sure each team is balance. It's not like most FPS where everyone can pick the same gun and dominate the game, then have that gun be nerfed, then people making another gun op, no. There are 64 people in a game, and there are multiple classes in it, which each class provides a limit to how many people are allowed to pick a class. For instance, some games only 3 people are allowed to be snipers, sometimes only 2 are allowed. This isn't a game where you can go Rambo, accuracy is important to this game, there are no crosshairs, so shooting from the hip is quite difficult unless you're really close range. For many rifles, missing just once is the difference between life or death. You have to take cover and aim if you want to rack up on kills. Also, you will accidentally kill your teammates, and that's because names won't appear above anyones head until you get close to them, but remember it's trying to be realistic, so it makes sense that you'll struggle to identify enemies from friendies, just like in actual war. I really recommend this game for any FPS fans that are willing to try something that's not Call of Duty, and I hope you enjoyed this review.			",76,11,0,5,2,0,5

												I continue to brag about this game to my friend, 'have you tried Rising Storm?' and often I get blank looks like 'what is that game?"". Despite their stares of disbelief, this is a solid game that continues to get better with each release. Red Orchestra 2, a dependable WWII game won't blow your socks off, but it is a good proving ground, and Rising Storm the next release certainly has better graphics as one would expect, although it isn't triple A quality graphically. Still, while the settings help, it's the following that helps it stand out from all other games on par with the Battlefield series. Why are Rising Storm and Red Orchestra series better than COD games? First is the game mode, King's Push where your team is either defending or attacking, winning objectives that push the enemy back to new maps, therefore the battlefield is constantly changing. Second, while you play as an individual, it is only with team work that your side succeeds, thus is is a well balanced game. Spawn on the squad, or command it, or command the entire team, the options are impressive but not overwhelming. Third, it is easy to use but is robust in the type of things you can do, like laying down traps, claymores or whatever. Fourth, you can man a mortar, flame thrower or do other specialty things that keep is interesting and fun. Fifth, it gives you the feeling of fighting another team and not that swiss cheese run and gun of COD maps... you really feel like you're part of an army pushing against an entrenched enemy. With the upcoming Vietnam, despite the bugs in the Beta, the solid nature of TripWire's games, and the addition of flyable vehicles, it is bound to be a awesome experience especially when you add 64 players to the field. If you don't have 64 humans Tripwire adds bots so the server is always full of targets.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Orchestra 2 is a fantastic fps game.Like few others, it walks the dangerous tightrope between realism and arcadey fun.The high respawn rate and massive waves means that the game is not as tense as games like 'Insurgency' but is much much faster-paced.It can be frustrating in early playthroughs as you die very quickly - especially to unseen enemies - but slowly, you can learn ways of keeping yourself safe from enemy fire.The class system works best when there are large teams with players filling each role. Most players are riflemen, restricted to their humble bolt-action rifle and explosive grenades. It can be very tempting to move to classes with cooler toys but these often come with more responsibilities like commanding squads, spotting enemies, calling in artillery and mortar fire, and laying smoke. This reflects the real-life structure of these armies and is a more subtle counterpart to Overwatch or TF2 style class system.Maps have wide degrees of variety and encourage all sorts of game play. There are many avenues for attack and defense and, within a single map, change from wide open spaces to dense city streets or even firefights within single large buildings such as the grain elevator. They also eschew the tendency for drab greyness, and manage to create realism with a bright colour palette from time to time, especially in rising storm.If you:- enjoy military realism- want fast-paced tactical team action- have patience for challenging mechanics- enjoy the feeling of being in a large scale battleBUY THIS GAME			",123,19,2,13,17,1,23

												 Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad is the follow-up to Tripwire's original hit multiplayer PC title, Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45, which has gone on to sell nearly half a million units since launch. This time, the game will feature a greatly expanded multi-player experience, with multiple new game modes, a complete first person cover system, destructible terrain, enhanced weapon mechanics and realistic WWII combat made truly accessible. In addition, the game will feature single-player and co-op game modes, allowing the player to play a full campaign from the Russian and, for the first time in a first person shooter, from the German point of view. Tripwire's renowned weapon handling improved even further, with new features and sounds. And tanks created with fully-operational 3D interiors, hugely enhancing the original game’s vehicle experienceRed Orchestra 2 is the best murder simulator I've ever played. It's not the best first-person shooter or multiplayer game, or even the best team-based multiplayer game. It's certainly not the best World War II game, and its singleplayer is the worst I've played in years. But in the killing, and in the being killed, Red Orchestra 2 is a terrifying and satisfying experience.Let's talk about you for a minute. You're a soldier in either Hitler or Stalin's army, and you're♥♥♥♥♥♥scared. You've got your back against the wall in a room with one door, two windows and three walls, and you're peeking around a corner into the exposed core of a half-destroyed building. Every room could conceal an enemy soldier, and you've died a hundred times already, always from that one angle you didn't check.Looking down through the rubble, you see an enemy soldier break from behind a wall. You aim and fire in a single motion. You've shot him and now he's dead. It's exactly like a million other games, but it feels nothing like any other game. It's the little things that make the difference, such as the sound of your own breathing when you lifted the rifle to your face, and the way it bobbed slightly in your hands. It's in the mark on your enemy's chest where the bullet hit, and the way his blood spritzed from his back, marking that bullet's exit. It's in the way he fell, forced by some terrible weight. Sometimes, but not this time, it would be the way he clutches his stomach, yelling in Russian, or the way he fires his machinegun madly during his last few seconds of life.I highly recommend this game!

												My name is John Le'borsho, Im from Lake Charles, Louisiana. I was drafted, like my friends and brothers, into a war that had to be fought. I was 19....just had my birthday, when our ship got the news, we were headin to a island named Iwo Jima. Since me and my squad hadn't seen a fight, we waited to land on the second wave. They told us about this place, how they burned it to flat earth, yet the tojo still hid somehow, I aint gonna lie, I was scared. I sat there, ready to load into the landing craft, reading my Bible, when our Navy Corpsman, Justin Landry, walked up and tapped me on the helmet. ""Its time to go son."" he said quietly. Grabbing my Garand, I got ready to load up at our Captains command....I dont really remember the ride, it was quiet on the boat, the faint sound of gunshots started to grow however. Suddenly, the vessel shook violently, throwing me down. As I climbed to my feet, I looked to my right, to see a boy, Pvt.Rick Barson, slumped in the corner, blood pouring out his neck from shrapnel. ""Oh my God."" is all I could breath out, before the landing boat suddenly slammed to a stop, the gate falling open....but I just kept staring at the body. ""UNLESS YOU WANNA END UP LIKE HIM, GET YOUR♥♥♥♥♥MOVING!"" The Corpsman yelled at me, throwing me off the boat and into the inch deep water washing the sand.        Quickly I grabbed my rifle and started running, bodies laid on the beach, craters filled the rocky sand, blood soaked the ground. I saw a squad of Marines on the top of the crest of the beach, handing out ammo and supplies. ""Whats the situation Corporal?"" our 2ndLT yelled out. ""This is the 3rd ♥♥♥♥ing day sir, and the tojo are hanging on the that damn mountain with their lives. We are pushing, but not quickly. They keep trying to flank left from the mountain, we are barely keeping them back, with all spares moving up the mountain!"" the Cpl shouted over planes, tanks and cannon fire. ""Then we are going to back up Sgt.Nickle's squad boys!"" Our 2nd LT yelled to us, and we quickly nodded.        Running through the woods, we couldnt get past the smell of burning flesh, and flies everywhere, till we finally came to a small dip in the rocks, to see a half dead squad of Marines, fending off about 200 japanese imperial soldiers. ""Pvt.Daniel, Corporal.Youngblood, get up on that rock and set up the 30.cal Browning, Lance Corporal and PFC on me, PFC.John and Justin, go help those Marines on the right of those barricades, NOW GO!""          As I ran past whizzing bullets and dead bodies, I saw the Marines we were assisting. One was holding a patch on his side, blood oozing out as he fired from his side with his 45. , the other was young, but firing frantically with his Browning Auto Rifle, and the third, was carefully picking shots with a 30.caliber carbine. I then realized this was the Sargent, so I ran to his side and dropped down as Justin landed beside the wounded Marine. ""Sargent, are you ok!?"" I asked. ""SHUT UP AND SHOOT!"" was his response.          As I leaned up, a sudden blast of dirty hit me in the face and a round landed 5 inches from me, quickly making me drop back down. I regained my senses and gripped my 30-06 tightly, leaning back out to pick a target....but I couldn't, cause just as zebras confuse lions, there where to many to count, or focus on.....so I waited till one ran infront of my sights and......bang...miss. I was starled, I was an expert marksman, so I took another bead and....bang.. I watched the japanese soldier run a few more feet before stumbling, and suddenly slumping to the ground.....I had killed a man.I stared for a moment as the world stood still, only to come back and fire again, and again, and again and again till *Ping*. Looking down at my open chamber, I went to reach for another enbloc clip, when suddenly the BAR Marine yelled ""LOOK OUT, MOVE!""            I glanced up just in time to see a slow, light mortar land 7 feet from me. Then I just laid there....I had been thrown, I chunk of my leg was missing from the side, the wounded Marine had a shoulder and arm missing, the BAR Marine was laying on his back, firing until a round hit his heart, Justin was going hand to hand with a Tojo officer, the Sargent was trying to get his Colt out, and the Tojo had just brought friends. I saw the 2nd LT try to get to us, on for a hell of rounds hit the cover he was behind. So I just laid there, a load ring was all I could hear, my vision tunneling. I watched as Justin overpowered the officers, stealing his short sword and killing stabbing him with it, before drawning the officers nambo from his holster and firing at Japs heading to me. A wave of gun fire hit the officer, and Justin as they both fell over, and a Tojo ran up to me, sticking a bayonet to my chest.           As I tried to reach up and grab his arm, he laughed and pushed down. I groaned, and grabbed his arm, trying to push back and use my other hand to grab his grenade. However, suddenly a round smashed into his chest, throwing him off of me, and about 20 Marines ran out the trees, some shooting, others charging the Tojo. I watched as the officer's body somehow rolled off Justin, only to watch the Corpsman push off the dead body and get up, holding his side and firing a type 100. I looked up as another Corpsman lifted me up to a sitting position. I heard a young Marine yell out, ""LOOK, ON TOP OF THE HILL!"" and I glanced to see what he was worked up about.            And among the hell and chaos, I saw a poll, with a small American flag on it, get slammed into the face of that mountian, claiming in for the U.S.A., I watched it wave in the wind as Justin and the 2nd LT ran over.....then I passed out.....and was calm			",27,0,0,0,2,0,0

												Fantastic game that offers a high level of detail, innovation and options. RO2 offers a challenging, yet rewarding, style of gameplay. True you will get picked off countless times as you bumble around the map but once your survival instinct kicks in and you pull of that 150m headshot with your trusty bolt action there is no kill in any game quite like it. And although the game had a rocky start the developers have, for the most part, listened to the community. The game continues to grow and improve with a large update containing tonnes of free content just on the horizon. If you are looking to purchase Red Orchestra 2 get the Rising Storm expansion as it RO2 comes with it (and you save yourself a few pounds/euros/dollars/yen). ",104,26,0,23,8,3,23

												I am a loyal soldier of the Red Army - a simple partisan, I have and always will be a Red Army soldier, regardless of the threat posed by the German Army's well-equipped, better trained soldiers. Over the course of my years as one of Ivan's finest, I've seen my best friend crushed under the treads of a fearsome Panzer III.I have witnessed the mass executions of my people at Bridges.I've stood my ground, helpless to save my comrades as we are pinned down by suppressing fire from an MG-42.War is truly hell.Yet even now, as I cower in my frozen foxhole praying that the next artillery shell doesn't land on my head... even as I pray that some day I will make it home to see my beautiful wife or witness my son who is now old enough to walk... I gather myself. I am one of Russia's finest. I pick up my faithful mosin, load the last two cartridges into the chamber, adjust my bayonet, and charge into the smoke.Seriously. This game has given me PTSD. I dream about the horrors of war and watch my friends die every night. I want my mommyBuy it.			",97,9,0,12,18,1,20

Pretty good graphics.2.Different classes, each class has its own set of weapons and equipment.3. The damage system is very well thought out. A punch in the stomach? No matter perepetuya. If you find yourself in the heart to say goodbye to life.4.Different modes.5.Complexity. The game is difficult to survive, and everything is difficult.6.Ballistics.7.Classroom map.8.Well-rounded weapon.9.Solves skill10.

												I will now document my first game.- I didnt know what map it was, all I knew was that there was a broken car thing on the bridge that we needed to pass to get to the capture point- Rush forward with comrades, not knowing what I'm doing- URAAAAAAAA- Gunshots erupt all around me, I am cut down by an MG42- Respawn, rush forward with new wave- Dive to cover behind broken car thing, the only thing I can do is cry and hold onto my helmet as bullets whiz around me- The enemy MG is reloading, I take this time to rush out of cover and shoot the supporting enemy rifleman and then the enemy MG- I rush into the point, a Fritz turns around the corner, I shoot him- A shot rings out, I turn around, my vision fading to black, and I see the German who shot me- Pull the trigger and mow him down- Die smilingMy actions would soon win the game for my comrades, as we finally got past that chokepoint10/10, for Mother Russia!

Posted: November 25, 2016
												I'm not really practiced in the art of writing reviews and other such things,hence I can be quite hectic with my writing's quality,as a matter of fact,most of the time,my writing is all over the place,digressing and sidetracking a lot from the original point. So,with that in mind,I hope you can bear with me here,as I attempt to form a coherent review of sorts for Red Orchestra 2 ,my favourite multiplayer/fps/WWII game to date.The game was released in September,2011 and takes place in the Second World War,specifically,the Eastern-Front,even more specifically,the battle of Stalingrad. [This event comes off as a bit personal for me,because my ancestors fought there,alongside with the germans,italians,spaniards,romanians,and croatians. I hasten to add that I have nothing but the utmost respect for both sides of the war.]With that out of the way,let's look at the game,how it manages to recreate this hellish environment.When the game came out,it was really buggy,it had performance issues,it was prone to crashing,and there was barely enough content to quell the gamers needs. Since then,the game saw a dramatic improvement both performance and content wise (even though the content is still a bit lackluster,but it can be expanded,more on that later).The gameplay itself is a perfect mix between casual fps shooters and mild milsims. It's got a cover system,squads,chain of command,one shot killing mechanics. It can be either infantry only,or combined arms,meaing that there is vehicle and tank based combat in the game present. So I'd say it is a fusion of Battlefield and Insurgency/ArmA. It is hardcore enough that you feel a bit more involved and tactical,and it is casual enough to not get frustrated. You can either choose to LARP as a soviet/russian in the Red Army or a national socialist/german in the Wehrmacht. The game has native voices,meaning both sides speak their native language,respectively. I highly recommend turning this feature on,not only it increases immersion,but it helps you identify your opponent.Speaking of immersion,this game delivers in every department: the sound design is stellar,as is the soundtrack,the graphics are realistic,animations and gore are sufficient enough so that you get your daily dose of PTSD.Now onto the content: the game has a respectable amount of maps (although some of them are played over 9k times a day,I'm looking at you Bridges),a good amount of weapons and classes to choose from,there is a leveling system (separate for weapons,classes and overall level,eventually reaching Hero status lvl 99) ,some veterans find this to be superficial and needless,but I have no grudges against this gameplay mechanic. Other than the vanilla maps,you can download custom maps,mods,and complete overhauls through the steam workshop,which is a huge plus. A few years back,the devs held a map competition,so the best custom maps could become a part of the vanilla game,and the content creators were rewarded greatly. After that,they did not abandon their game,but further improved upon it,adding a few more maps,a territory based campaign (which is the most popular game mode as of now),new weapons for both sides,and some new vehicles.One simply cannot afford not talking about the community in a game where the main pulling force is multiplayer. It is quite small (2000-3000 tops),but all the more dedicated. You will find all kinds of people from all walks of life. There is an abundance of memers,trolls,casuals,hardcore elitists,friendly veterans,LARPers,commies,nazis,so on and so forth. I can say with confidence,that I have mostly positive experiences with the guys playing the game. Some server admins can be total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s,abusing their powers,but other than that,you will definitely find your place and your role you are comfortable with.Some thoughts about the downsides: minor bugs,glitches,sometimes clunky movement,rare occasions of wonky cover mechanics,the load times can be a bit long,vehicle physics are not the most polished,and the sorts. Nothing game breaking but aggrovating little things nonetheless. The devs have a small studio with limited funds (hopefully that will change with Killing Floor 2 and Rising Storm 2 : Vietnam),so it is understandable to an extent.All in all,if you want an authentic WWII experience with a friendly and welcoming community,good amount of content,and you are tired of all the other popular fps franchises with the same carbon copies every year,and can look over a few bugs,and minor annoyances,I can definitely recommend this game. Thank you for reading,I hope this wall of text was helpful.			",61,8,0,9,1,0,10

												Best multiplayer game out there, also known as ""PTSD Simulator"".You will die and you will see your brothers in arms die. You will see them burn to a crisp or dismembered by artillery fire. You will charge tanks, no hope of survival, just to save your komrades. You will see them die from invisible snipers. You will face wave after wave of Russian soldiers, banzai charges and the might of the German army... And whatever the result of those confrontations is... you will have lost. One way or the other.

												Red Orchestra 2 / Rising Storm is an amazing game. While most shooters these days are fast paced , this game does not go down that path. This is a good thing , in my opinion. Rather than run around and shoot people to try to get to the top of the Leaderboards , this game is about working with your team , to complete a certain objective. The game is extremely realistic. You feel like you are actually in the game. Hearing the bullets whizzing by overhead , the screams of pain of dying men and mortar explosions going off in the distance help to immerse you into the game. The graphics are also pretty damn good, the maps look great.A very unique game.Definately pick up this game if you want a realistic , team based first person shooter.9/10 , my FPS GOTY			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's start with the “Meh”: the game's singleplayer mode is the biggest, if not only, weakness of this title. They try to make a story around it, but it feels and plays identical to the Multiplayer. In that respect, the SP part feels more like ""training with bots"" than anything else. But that's because it is.The real meat and bones of this juicy, juicy bean stew is in the multiplayer and I dare say that RO2 is the only title that has been able to display accurately the feel and struggle of the Second World War. Besides the maps and weapons and guts flying in all directions when a grenade lands, and all the bolt-action weapons, RO2 capture the essence of World War II by genuinely not giving a flying f*ck about the player.No, really. Everything in this game is created with the precise reason of making your life hard and it works on so many levels. The movement is rough, with any sprint taking from your stamina bar, making it harder to aim. Entering or exiting crouch or prone will make you lose control of your weapon for a few seconds. Gone are the days of the Battlefield 3+ super soldier who could run, jump, sprint and crouch quicker than you can say “I wish they didn’t close the BF2142 servers”. Nearby artillery or enemy gunfire will also make your stamina deplete faster. When it gets to zero, your screen turns black and white and you can no longer zoom in while aiming; making shooting a more difficult endeavour. And a difficult one it is nonetheless; aiming is done in the usual modern manner, but with an extra twist. You can do a slight zoom while aiming down the sight, vital for the large fields that fill the RO2 maps (players of Operation Flashpoint 1 / Arma will know this feature). Trust me, you will need this slight zoom. On many maps, discerning a distant player from friend or foe is a challenge within itself and at first you will find yourself shooting friendlies in this game (remember to say “sorry”), but that is part of war, for war is gruesome. But perhaps the most authentic feature that strives to the game’s reality is it’s class system. In RO2, classes are restricted. Each map has x snipers, y gunners, z heavy gunners and so forth. These numbers are always small (less than 5), with the bulk of the players filling the most used class, Rifleman. This means that most players in a server will be using bolt-action rifles, while the more complex ones will have access to better weapons or tools/traits. This also highlights one of the game’s weaker points, since, without a pretty strong machine and gaming rig, your map will load slowly, lessening your chances of choosing the desired class.Even so, I cannot recommend RO2 enough. It is a gem among 64-player FPS games and should be experienced by anyone who is interested in massive multiplayer shooters. The core game, along side with the Rising Storm expansion and the free maps created by the community give you a game that is still played thoroughly, for good reason. ",207,25,1,30,23,0,57

Welcome to the meat grinderIf there is a game that can tell that you are nothing but meat in a war is this one.No game has ever given me the sense of morale, chills and terror as RO2.When you join a 64 player server and a new map starts all you can hear is all your teammates charging to the objective, when you hear that you know that match needs to be won.In here you don't play for the kills, you play for the motherland/fatherland and your comrades that fight and die with you by your side.You can command your own Tank/Half-track (on certain maps that allow it) with different players occupying each role inside the vehicles, Yes you heard that right, no ridiculous 1 man inside tank that does-everything-at-same-time♥♥♥♥♥♥here. Your tank driver gets shot? Too bad, you have to move yourself to the driver seat and use the vehicle with a less than adequate crew count.Being a machine gunner in this game is really fun, specially when you can use MG's like MG42 that shred any Yuri on its path and the pure terror of the gun firing so many rounds is incredible. The game has a very nice mechanic where your gun barrel can get extremely hot and break the gun if you fire too much, too fast, requiring you to switch out the barrels.You don't find your usuall CSGO/COD kid here. The rambo gameplay that works on other games will never work here. That's a bonus right there.It is a blast playing with good Team Leaders. They use their brain to strategically order heavy artillery on a fortified area via radio & relay orders to squad leaders to go attack/defend certain locations via voice chat.The game has actual suppresion mechanics. If you fire at a sandbag cover for example where 2 enemies reside, their vision will become extremely blurry/hazed/fuzzy and gray. This allows you to cover fire your teammates just by firing enemies cover while they move up.With all this you got an authentic WW2 simulator.If there was a version of this game with official developed VR support, you could probably get PTSD from play this in just a couple hours.Game is worth every $. (Also note that every dlc has been free)Only thing this game has that is bad is the AI. The soldier AI is bad, but since everyone just plays multiplayer and the devs knew this, there isnt much point to AIYou should know that you are going to die a lot. I mean a lot, in the start the game will make you die so much that you don't even know where the enemy is. With time, that gets better as you get to know the game better and position yourself better in the battlefield.Things I recommend when playing this game for the first time:Enable native voice-overs, this way you don't hear Russians and Germans talking English. Much more immersive.Play on realistic game mode servers (campaign or not)Play rifleman until lvl 20, or at least until you can get a good understanding of the game basics			",32,5,1,8,9,1,5

												This is my first foray into hardcore/realistic MMO shooters.Being used to playing CS, my first few games were utter confusion. I couldn't distinguish friends from enemies, I just can't aim fire and run at the same time. Run into an enemy face to face  when you turn a corner? Good luck getting that shot in while your mind just blanks out.My first ever thought when playing the game was ""Why is everyone running?"".  Where are they going? It was just utter confusion.But after a few hours, I was hooked. I've learned to flank the enemy. Fire a rifle when it counts. And minimize shooting at my own team mates.  But all that pales in comparison to the experience. You get to feel the confusion a battle brings, the paranoia, and the panic when you find out your commander just ordered an artillery attack on the very place you are standing on and running back to safer ground while your teammates mistake you for an attacking enemy.It's just spastic. One time, I accidentally shot a teammate while he was about to throw a grenade. Needless to say, everyone in the room died. Yes, I am that kind of a noob.That said, the community is  great. I mean, better than others if I may say. I would like to describe it, for a lack of a better word, more mature. I guess because the game demands a lot more patience and understanding than a standard run and gun. It's not for everybody. CS players would find this a bit taxing. And you do have to invest a bit of time to understand the mechanics. But for overall gameplay and enjoyment, for me at least,  this one is on the top of my list.And yeah, my teammates forgave me for that grenade drop.			",361,144,25,66,69,3,98

												Hi, Billy Mays hereAre you looking for a realistic, gritty, brutal and immersive world war II multiplayer fps? Have you always wondered what it felt like to have your skin melt off your bones as a stream of fire roasts your body? Do you wish to feel the satisfaction of hitting a running target - 300 meters away - right in the head? Have you always wanted to hold a katana in your hands and charge with your team at an unsuspecting American battalion?Well look no further, because this game answers your call!Rising storm is a very realistic multiplayer fps, with battles up to 64 people. The game is set in World war II, in the Pacific theatre, involving the United states and the Japanese. Battles are extremely intense, and teamwork and tactics play as a key contributor in winning battles. Most battles in rising storm involve the opposing team starting off at one end of the map and capturing or destorying key points, trying to advance forward, while you hold them back and defend them or vice versa. Teams are normally fixed in these scenarios (meaning one team is always going to be the attacker and the other defender).  The balancing in this game is very different from those in other games. Asymmetrical is the term. The Japanese, while having inferior weapons, have much more higher supression resistance and higher morale Aka balls made of titanum or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ compared to the Americans, who have frequent panic attacks. Sly little booby traps can be layed by the Japanese, also and you can get all of your mates to do a banzai charge (good times). However what the Americans DO have is the bigger guns, more load, heavy firepower and Macca's meaning they can use their superior technology to their advantage. Moving onto maps - Their designed almost perfectly. The maps are large and spacious without having loads of empty space and everything is placed in the right spot without being obvious. Every map is played differently too, for example 'Hanto' which is a dense jungle type area makes it very difficult for the Americans to spot the heavily camouflaged Japanese. Another map called Iwo Jima has an uphill slant with many concealed bunkers to defend from, which can ridden with booby traps. All in all the maps in this game is what balances the teams out the most.Rising storm has some really decent graphics. The gun models are astounding and realistic, and textures for character models are very good, too. Environments look gritty and worn out without being too dark and unrealistic. Overall its actually very, very decent. Audio in this game is great as well. It really does add suspense and fully immerses. No silly background sound effects, everything is being produced real time. The music is suprisingly very well done, and doesnt get in the way or break the immersion of a battle.The game may be very, very difficult to get used to for most people. Controls, character movement and coordination may feel clunky for some people as the weapon is not fixed to the center of the screen and the character gains speed instead of instantly moving. Many beginners will also find it difficult to tell the difference between their own fellow team members and the enemy and will shoot without confirming. It takes a while to get to know how each map works out and what the objectives are. In the end though, once you do get used to it you'll be satisfied.Lastly, communication is key in this game. Although a team may be able to capture a point or even win the round without communicating, it will most likely be very difficult as people will be scattered, unsure of when to attack and generally go off and do their own thing. So whoop out your mic and help out the team or if not, atleast take the time to learn which button you press to chat. If you're looking for a more casual experience, use a general role instead of a special class. You get 2 games for the  price of 19 bucks (USD), which is Rising storm and Red orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad bundled together. I probably shouldnt tell you about the download size. Happy Friday.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Look, this isn't Call of DooDoo or BF. This is a definitive FPS that requires teamwork and tactical movement.The fact that it is so long lived is a good indicator that it is of the highest quality. It certainly isn't as pretty as other FPS shooters, but then again it isn't your kiddies arcade game either. If you are looking for something that catches the reality of tactical combat over the computer, a place where the little screaming kids don't go and a game that you can play about WW2 (I'm sick of all the modern day shooters), one that requires good teamwork, tactical movement and doesn't make you superman just for the arcady experience, then this is the game. I have been FPS gaming since the early days of MOH:AA and seen all the iterations of the FPS, right up through the first CoDs and the first BFs to present day. This is still the game that I would call the best and most deserving of the genre for all time, thus far.			",55,6,1,17,7,0,27

												A pants-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly immersive multiplayer experience. Nothing will ever top the feeling of:- Creeping through a bombed-out apartment block in Stalingrad with a fellow soldier, only to hastily dive to cover as he gets sniped through the throat and spends several seconds bleeding to death, twitching and gurgling on the floor in front of you.- The clumsy, slow process of manning a position inside a tank; adjusting the cannon for range, angling your tank's position towards incoming fire for maximum chance of deflecting rounds, supporting friendly infantry, staying alert for enemy anti-tank soldiers or pioneers laying ambushes, and much more.- Picking off an opposing soldier at 150+ meters with a regular bolt-action rifle.- Sneaking up to a fortified building, methodically crawling and sprinting from cover to cover until you can finally blow a hole in the wall with a satchel charge, allowing friendly assault troops to storm it.- Cowering alone in the basement of a building as you hear gunfire, footsteps, and angry enemy voices directly above you.- When the clip in your bolt-action rifle runs dry at the exact same second an enemy soldier appears a few meters in front of you, leaving you with no option but to scream and charge him, sticking your bayonet between his ribs.- Rubber grenade physics that get you blown up more often than the enemy you're throwing it at.- Stinking fascists.- Bolshevik swine.- So, so much more.This is one of my all-time favorite FPS games. It's very difficult if you're playing against competent humans due to unforgivingly realistic damage (one rifle shot to center mass is all it takes, or even a pistol shot to the heart), movement (enjoy your winded soldier's arms shaking as you try to line up that 100m shot), and ballistics (better zero in those sights), but that just makes it so much more rewarding when you do kill that machine gunner or capture that strategic point to win the round. If you enjoy a dose of realistic masochism with your shooter action, I'd recommend this 100%.As for Rising Storm, I haven't played it at all so I can't comment there.			",56,2,0,1,1,0,4

												I was in a 64/64 player server....My squad was tasked with capturing objective Bravo....We were all rookies,and eager to destroy the bolsheviks.Suddenly,this piano song called ""Fallen Heroes"" starts playing.(I found the song name later of course)I liked it then.Then we just hear some russian words,and DP28 bullets flying all around us.I lied down next to a pile of dirt,and I looked around.That damn song was still playing and I seen my squad leader's body.Next to it,about 5 more.The last remains of the squad was pinned down about 10 meters away.I noticed the dead SL's smoke grenade.I ran towards to take it.Suddenly,a bullet hits.But where?I looked around,no one was hit.I looked at myself,and as soon as I realised I was the one who got shot everything was going dark.As a last effort I take the smoke grenade and throw it in the crossroads.The piano song ends all of a sudden,and my screen was completely dark.All I could hear was screams,russian or german,I don't know.My screen goes to the respawn menu...I heard a Rifleman from my squad named ""Moldplayer"" screaming ""♥♥♥♥♥♥it's a trap!get back!""It was too late,however.The T34 had butchered my whole squad.Mold tried falling back but he got exploded to gibs by a grenade.Then we respawned.I swear,no other game haunted me so much.

												12 YEAR OLDS:STOP BUYING THIS GAME. FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS SACRED AND PURE, YOU ARE RUINING THIS GAME WITH YOUR ANNOYING MIC SPAMS, CONSTANT WHINING, AND STUPIDITY OF TACTICS WHILST YELLING ""CHARGE ALPHA BRAVO ECHO ZULU!!!!!!"". Seriously? Your twelve; GO OUTSIDE.To normal society;Great game and the most realistic Second World War simulator out there. Unfortunately it still lacks ""expanse"", and since it focuses purely on Stalingrad, loses the overall Eastern Front aspects that the original Red Orchestra had (best game ever). On the bright side, this game is constantly being updated, whether it be big expansions or just minor bug solutions.Only downside of this game is the, as stated above, the 12 year olds and their microphone spam.If youre a parent, do us all a favor, and either dont let your kid play this game, or smash their microphone into little pieces.

												One of the few First Person Shooter (FPS) games that I have played that have a steep enough learning curve for it to remain challenging, but not overly steep that anyone can't play and have fun. I have put 56 hours into the game at the time of writing this review, and even I am still the 'newbie', I feel like I have lots to still learn about the way everything works in this game, but that is part of the fun.Red Orchestra 2/ Rising Storm is extremely tactical, you cannot just go running blindly around the map without expecting a bullet to the chest. You need to inspect the map, hide behind the cover of smoke as you make your progression towards the objective.I had never had as much fun in a WW2 shooter since my Medal of Honor Allied Assualt multiplayer days, the music is extremely atmospheric and I love running in a zig-zag in open towards some cover and bullet spring off the dirt around you making your vision go blurry.If you are looking for a game with a great community, great atmosphere and challenging but rewarding gameplay. Get this.See you on the battlefield, soldier.			",706,258,17,80,110,11,86

												This game is just great. Its the most tactical shooter I've ever played, with the same kind of hardcore features as Insurgency (another awesome tactical shooter), but generally slower paced and larger scale, with big maps and bolt action rifles. You'll be laying in craters for half a game, but the intensity of battle makes that experience just incredible. Bullets whiz past, you watch a comrade get shredded by an MG as you manage to dive for cover not a foot from his body. If you get shot, you might get this instace where your screen starts to fade and you have a few seconds to say ""♥♥♥♥ YOU!!!"" and put a bullet into an enemy, firing from the hip. There's a lot of the little things about this game I could spend pages talking about. and they all come together to make a gaming experience I will never forget.			",80,2,1,6,8,0,4

Posted: July 15, 2013
												Red Orchestra 2 is simply one of the finest if not the greatest WW2 game that has hit the market to date, and there are numerous features that make this game sine in almost every aspect to back this statement up.  First of all the graphics.When maxed out on the ultra graphics i dare say this game looks as realistic as a game can look and can compete even with the graphics of games such as Battlefield.In addition all the maps are geniously desinged so as both team work and tactical thinking are needed in order for a team to progress while at the same time maintening a balance between the 2 sides.  This also brings me to the next key aspect of the game that makes it so appealing to me ,which is TEAMWORK and i simply can not strech this enough.Forget about all your call of duties and battlefields and such where all you need for the victory is one effective player.In this game if teamwork is not utilized defeat is inevitable.Even the slightest hindering in a teams teamwork such as for example a gunner that doesnt know where to place his mg to provide supressing fire can mean the deference between a point captured and a point lost.And to back this importance of teamwork a finite amount of classes are being introduced ,each one utilizing different guns and equipment for different purposes.In addition each gun comes with up to 3 REALISTIC attachments that can be obtained through the extensive use of the gun.These attachments can vary and are all historically accurate in contrast to the ones in game such as call of duty (for example there's no apperture sight for the mp40,an attachment clearly completly fictional).  Moreover the games realistic feel is further increased by certain aspects that the HUD and the gun mechanics have.For the first time in the history of gaming there is no bullet counter and instead the player can have a rough guess of how many bullets he has left by quicly releasing and weighting his mag or by extracting his bolt half way to have a look at the clip if he is using a rifle.Most guns are also usually 1 shot kill if a player lands a headshot,a heartshot,a nutshot or an upertorso shot.If the player doesnt land one of these shots the player he hit will become wounded and will have to bandge immediatly if he wishes not to bleed out.Therefore the chances that you will hit and enemy and he will either kill you or run away are very few ,as they should in my opinion.The game also uses a realistic ballistic system accounting for gravity and such,and it is for that reason that the ability is given to the player to ajust his sights for the proper range.Actions availiable to the player such as changing barrels of an overheated mg,aiming through the iron sights of a snipe rifle and changing through the rate of certain machineguns also add to the realism.  Tank combat is furthermore a feature that sines in this game.Never before has the intirior of a tank looked so realistic in a game and never before have the correct seats within a tank been utilized correctly.In order for the tank to be used to its full potential, the gunner, the driver,the tank commander and the mg gunner will have to work together.  Last but not least a feature that i just love and think every game should have is that when the server is not full of players ,bots take the empty slots.In this way even if only 2 players are palying on a server the game wont feel empty and dead.I must however in account of fairness admit that the AI for the bots is nothing to be really proud of as they will often stay in the spawn running back and forth,stuck in various places or wont advance as the match progresses.I have met this bugs however only a handfull of times and i also have to say that they are not so game breaking as they sound,plus when the server has 56 bots 2 or 3 stuck or glitched isnt really a big deal.I have faith that Tripwire Interactive will adress this issue in a future patch however and so i do not count it as minus for this review.  To conclude Red Orchestra Heroes of Stalingrad is game that can be charectarized as realistic,graphicly immersive and thought provoking as it requires the player to strategically work with his teammates to achieve victory.It has only 1 minor issue that can be easily adressed in a later patch and is made by a company that is known to maintain its games freshness through patches,updates ,contests etc.It is a game with a staggering amount of inovative features and is sure not to disapoint you ,as long as you are not a casul 13 year old cod-loving tryhard.If I were to rate it I would definetly give it a 11/10.I hope this review has helped you and that i will see you online playing this marvel of a game.

												This game is Red ORCHESTRA right ?Tell me why I didn't see a single damn orchestra instrument such as brass, woodwinds, percussion, nor strings.Intead of expecting a rhythm based game. I've recieved PTSD some allergic reaction against Germans (Germanphobia) and Japanese (Tojophobia). I find myself having nightmares while I'm sleeping when I see my fellow teammates bleed to death on the ground having no hope of surviving, and I myself bleeding to death and spraying my pistol at the enemy and just bleed. Man, this is war not a joke brah. But in all seriousness. This game is VERY difficult to play. One can not just pick it up and expect to top score. There is a huge learning curve in this game. We all know counter-strike have a learning curve, but this game right here makes counter-strike look like ""CoD & BF.""The game gets annoying at times when one is just walking around moving and boom. R.I.P you just got sniped by a MG34, DP-28 (aka Dinner Plate 28), 30 Cal., or that type...whatever the Japanese army had. *Brain fart*In all honesty, this is the BEST WWII shooter around and best FPS shooter.

												War is hell.RO2: On the battlefield all of my nearby teammates died. Took down the enemy and witnessed everyone screaming, crying and calling for their mothers around me. Then heard one of them drown in their own blood for a good 30 seconds.RS: As the Japanese commander, ran straight at the enemy took out 4 enemies, got shot 6 times in the chest and head. After that killed 6 other enemies, marked the artillery, called it and killed around 10 enemies. Wow.After playing this game I now understand war a bit more. It's not good ;_; But it's a great game. More realistic like fps.ps. it reminds me of MAG on the PS3. What a great game that was too.

												So I buy this game, and after learning some basic stuff in training I decide to hop into a battle with a friend. We both make the incredibly easy choice of fighting for the Fatherland, and hence I fire up this to fight to:


YouTube™ Video: Es Ist So Schon,Soldat Zu Sein. 

			Views: 11,086		

			Die Alter Kameraden.		

We fight long and hard, across streets, room to room, from an arm's length away to a good 150m out. The bullets fly about us, and as we're moving through a building, getting close to an objective, a bullet flies into my Kamerad's chest. His cries of pain echo through the entire complex. And with his last few breaths he tells me, ""Komm Kamerad, und reich mir deine Hand! Und nimm diesen Ring von meinem Finger, und schenk ihn meiner Liebst' als Abschiedspfand!""Heartbroken and sorrowing, I change the tune to something a little more fitting:

			Views: 153,107		

			Video verwendet (Video used in making): Unsere Mütter, unsere Väter 1941 German Airmen Funeral Nominiert/Nominate: LowCake DawnVanquisher		

On and on I fight, the thought of his young life still all too fresh in my mind, before a similar bullet strikes into my own head.It was not a long while later that we respawned and tried again.			",133,26,3,8,36,0,35

												RO offers hours and hours of epic first person action with different mechanics than like CoD type of games. You will crouch in trenches, lean on walls more than in any other game, you will camp and fear for your life. If you enjoy more realism in your games, WW2, big fights even with tanks, artillery, chain of command, strategy and ATMOSPHERE of war  - this is good choice for you.  8,5/10			",84,13,0,16,14,0,28

												Today I will be reviewing a video game called Red Orchestra 2. The game was developed by Treyarch (The same people responsible for such classics as : The Great Gatsby, A Clockwork Orange and Super Mario Brothers) and published by Ubisoft.Let's talk a bit about the game :The game takes place in a post apocalyptic Paris in the year 2250. When the game begins, you can see society rebuilding itself all around you. Society has been split into 2 sides : The neo-nazis and the capitalists. The neo-nazis are a group led by Adolf Hitler's brain which was recovered by the Illuminati from the very same bunker where Hitler commited suicide. The second group is led by Rndrew Ayan. He is a curious Lovecraft inspired repairman, whose seeking to bring Paris back to it's former glory through any means necessary. The game offers you two ways to play, join the nazis in their quest to take over Paris for the Führer or join the capitalists to restore things to the way they were. The story is amazing. One minute I found myself laughing at the obscure situations that the capitalist soldiers found themselves in, the next I was crying when they lost the Eiffel tower because Sgt. Johnson (Who is a key character in the Capitalist campaign) wanted to send a telegram to his wife back in Austria who was missing him dearly.Let's talk about the game's mechanics next :The game is presented in a 2D Bird's Eye perspective, at first I thought this was odd, however it becomes apparent that this was the directors vision and the game is perfect as is. One of they key mechanics of the game is the point'n'click-esque interface, featuring options such as : ""Insult"", ""Batter"", ""Shoot"" and ""Heil"". Characters in the game react to your every move, from simply moving around to doing key story changing events such as demolishing the Eiffel tower ( which is entirely optional ). The game blends the 2D, Run and gun, Romance, Adventure and Puzzle game elements within it seamlessly to create a unique experience the likes of which will probably never be bested.Move over Call of Duty Ghosts, Medal of Honor Warfighter and Battlefield 4. There's a new king in town and his name is Red Orchestra 2.10/10			",265,59,6,41,18,2,19

												I'd like to start off by saying that I did not enjoy this game, however I don't intend to discourage people from playing it simply because I wasn't entertained, especially now when you can get the game for free. Red Orchestra 2 is a fickle monster. On the one hand, the innovative gameplay and close attention to realism and detail give this release tons of potential. Unfortunately, the amount old-fashioned quirks coupled with the most clueless AI I've seen in a while takes away a lot from what this game has to offer.If you strip the game's uninspired visuals and interface and manage to come past its bugs and glitches, Red Orchestra 2 takes no prisoners with its realistic mechanics and physics. It is a game for a hardcore PC audience who thrive on this type of games with its relatively slow-paced tempo yet high intensity.An immensely ambitious game, and in some ways, it's even a groundbreaking one. However, its focus on realism will turn off fans of arcade shooters. If you think both Battlefield and Call of Duty are too exaggerated and unrealistic, and feel Counter-Strike is too soft, Red Orchestra 2 might be the game for you. It doesn't appeal to me, though.

Our flamethrowers burn them out of the brush and push them back to their home camp.They are dug in, hard.

												The best FPS ever made in my opinion. Very well thought out maps, great immersion and 32v32 multiplayer make charging machine guns, artillery and snipers a thunderous and terrifying affair. You will die an awful lot while learning the ropes, as it's 1-2 shot kills (just like real life!) but If team work is your thing, and you don't mind running over piles of corpses screaming for their mothers, then this is the game for you. 400 hours into it, and it's still the best money I ever spent on steam by a mile			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've never played a tactical team play game that grants the flexibility, the complexity, and the amount of realism that Red Orchestra 2 brings. I can't think of any parallel that comes close. That alone should say a lot if you're looking to buy the game. In short, it's worth every dollar even at regular price, but for any game, I still say wait for the sale. This game hits sale price a lot.Now, I'm not saying this game is perfect. It has a few negatives which I'll cover but take the negatives with a grain of salt. The positives within this game far outweigh the negatives.I'll start with the negatives, the integrated ""Cover system"" is broken in some ways. It doesn't entirely keep you in cover. I find, players who use the Cover system easier to kill behind cover. This is because, the animation your character goes into when using integrated covering leaves your character's head and back exposed to fire at modest angles. And by modest, I mean an enemy won't have to move much to kill you in the integrated cover system. I turned my auto-cover button off by unbinding the key associated with it under Game Options. If I want to use cover, I do it myself without the integrated system.That's honestly the only negative I give this game. The rest is good news in terms of how much I enjoyed this game for challenge and reward. You'll find after several hours or several dozen hours that this game has very extensive experience system. Guns gather experience, classes gather experience, and your character level gathers experience. The experience system is not just a number, higher levels grants suppression resistances, stamina buffs, and accuracy buffs. These buffs become quite helpful at higher levels. Guns that gather experience will gain tiers, each gun has a maximum level of 50 and there are 3 tiers associated with it. Each gun gets tier 1 by default, tier 2 is unlocked at level 25 and tier 3 is unlocked at level 50. Depending on what gun you have, tier 2 and tier 3 will have unlocked attachments for the gun like long-range sights and bayonets or extended magazines. This system is very grindy however, since there are so many guns to level. If you're a completionist like me, getting every gun to level 50 will take a very long time.There are a wide variety of historical guns for all four nations. Each gun has better uses than others, it's up to the user to decide which gun you like most. Majority of players will say PPSH-41 is the weapon of choice, while others will counter that the MG42 and Mkb 42 are better. It's a constant daily argument. I personally like all the guns, even the bolt action rifles. In a full 64-player game, I was able to get MVP using only a rifleman class with a bolt action rifle. It depends on how well you want to perform.There are vehicles, there are medium tanks, light tanks and troop transports. Medium tanks and light tanks get their own classes and are effective but not over-powered. An experienced tank driver can cause a lot of headache, but in contrast, an experienced anti-tank gunner can take out a tank with a single well placed shot at the tank's ammo rack.Being Commander is a lot of fun but also actually requires a lot of hands-on command skills. Commander's job is basically to sit at the radio and call in artillery or recon. Commander can also force-respawn players waiting to respawn. Giving orders is important, not only are you telling your team where to go. Players within the area of your order get +1 points for each kill and capturing objectives as a result of your order. Additionally, AI actually follow Commander orders. Sending 30 or so AI into a single base is quite funny.The AI is not the smartest nor the worst... It's difficult to describe the AI, they're amazing and terrible at the same time. Sometimes you can stand in front of an AI and it won't shoot you or it will miss you a dozen times. And on the other hand, AI are known to do 180 no-scope headshots. It's up to you to decide on this one.It's almost nearly impossible to notice for new players so I will point it out now. There is bullet drop. But bullet drop is not noticeable until you are about 200m away from your target. But that is rare, majority of the time you will be shooting within 170m on average and a lot of close quarters right down to melee combat. In all my hours of playing this game, I have only had to change my sight range to 200m for only one kill.Pros:Wide variety of maps and gamemodes. (Best gamemode imo is Campaign)Large selection of weapons.Extensive experience system that rewards at new levels.A lot of active communities and it's easy to find a full 64-man server. (I find full servers daily as of this review.)Realistic combat. (Realism-mode adds to this and it's the only mode I play. It's kind of this game's 'hardcore mode.')Tanks and transports are not OP.User-friendly command system.Artillery adds zest to an already pleasant experience.Workshop is available for custom maps and mods.Single-player AI battles in Workshop. (I still prefer playing against players.)Cons:Can be unforgiving for new players. You will die a lot.Broken ""Cover System.""Tanks are easy to get stuck.Neutral:Mkb 42 and MG42 gunshot sound effects are too loud. (my own opinion, however.)AI is both amazing and terrible.Stamina is low and gun handling is terrible for new players. (all fixed via gaining levels)Overall, I highly recommend this game. It took me away from Battlefield 4, haven't gone back since.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Forget about being a hero:War is about survival, following orders. Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad (Rising Storm too btw) captures this very same feeling to the perfection. Forget about running on the field and firing two machine guns akimbo like Rambo. You're a soldier, russian or german, american or japanese. The fight will always seem unfair and it is: get over it. Then how can you win and enjoy you may ask? Keep your head down, take cover, watch out for your teammates, follow your commander's orders, go for the objectives: be a soldier. The slightest misstep can kill you and your teammates. And if you win the battle, always remember that you would never have made it without your team, your squad leader and your commander.Footmen win wars, but don't get credit:More often then you'd want, you will have the role of a lousy footman, a bolt action rifle and 2 grenades. That is it, but you must make the best out of it. And if you do well enough, you'll have the opportunity to get promoted: sniper, automatic rifle, anti-tank or even tank crewmember. Don't worry, this game is hard at first, but always try your best, take time, don't rush things.A pearl is always difficult to acquire:This game is hard because it is different. It requires patience and strategy. It may seem hard and it can be frustrating. But trust me, if you want to see what war really is, i think Red Orchestra 2 gives a decent vision of that.

												If you take your games VERY serious this is a good game to get. This is not a run around and kill right when you see them type of game, it's very realistic. It feels like your in WW2 except back then they didn't have any headsets to discuss locations and such. In this game you can hear all the gunshots and yelling while you're crouched up underneath a window afraid to look out because they're everywhere and will fire at you fast right when they see you. This game requires lots of planning and skill to play. You need planning to win the game, otherwise it'll be unbalanced on the field and if the other team has someone talking plans you're sure to lose.Great game if you like lots of planningBad game if you like running around and getting kills			",89,4,0,3,11,0,8

												RO2 is a brilliant FPS. +It still looks considering when it came out. Also runs great (constant 60fps with all settings at max, and i got a 3 year old PC)+Realistic gameplay. One or two shots and it's lights out! You can't rush or play this like it's your BF/CoD game. Smart and tactical play is rewarded.+RS expansion is great, and it's free. Some developers would demand 30$ or more for content like that (just look games like SW: Battlefront, and what their season pass offers and yet they ask 60$ for it)+Amazing atmoshpere. You really feel like you are there. Never played such an atmoshperic online FPS.+Not too hardcore like ARMA and not too casual like CoD/BF - perfect balance.-Team killing from SUKA players. SUKA!

												Combat Report for HQCodename: Operation Stalemate IIVeteran class Squad leader #2, DidHeDiedTime of operation: 8:32am, September 15th, 1944Clear weather, humidity and temperature both high.Our commander (Dr. Steve Brule) has tasked squad #2 with taking objective Bravo on the airbase beach island of Peleliu.Near unacceptable casualties expected.8:45am, we land and begin our assault on the airfield. I smack hotkey 6 for my binoculars, and get an artillery mark for Commander Brule.But our Commander was not at the radio... He was solo charging the enemy line (smoke grenade in hand) and singing backstreet boys are back on public voice comms; with overwhelming gusto.I later found out this is called “psychological warfare”At first the enemy couldn’t believe what this American was doing and were hesitant to shoot, Commander brule then ran back to the battalion radio after laying down a smoke screen for squad #2.He then gave his orders “Wait for the first 3 salvos of artillery, then we ♥♥♥♥ them like a warm cherry pie boys!”I count the salvos and keep my squad in check, on the start of the 4th salvo I let out a piercing battle cry over team voice comms; and we begin our charge over no man's land.9:15am, squad #2 advanced into and took the enemy trenches of objective Bravo.During our assault we took 3 casualties to type 99 MG's: LulzBoy69, Drunkenballsack and MustyGooch, may their souls rest in peace (for the next 8 seconds, 7 seconds, 6 seconds, FORCE RESPAWN BY DR. STEVE BRULE).Squad #2 fought valiantly for the next few points, we had a brave flamer lead the charge, and riflemen follow, with our MG’s dishing out relentless amounts of lead suppression on the enemy positions. I am only allowed 10 minutes of computer. Now I have to put on the jacket that stops my arms from moving and go back to my room.My room has soft walls, it is nice, but it gets a bit lonely sometimes.You’ll probably get to join me here if you buy the game, yay I can’t wait to see you!

												As I make my way through the ruins of apartments, the sound of silence is broken as I hear the frantic footsteps of a fascist approach from behind me. I turn to see the German appear at the doorway and shoot him in the heart. My 7.62x54R bullet shoves him against the frame of the door as his life is robbed from him. He slowly slides to the floor, clenching his chest, gasping for his sad life. As he gazed right into my eyes I witnessed his very damned soul depart from this twisted world. As his fight to strive on ends I hear these words come from my mouth, ""I will never get these faces out of my mind"". Then, I continue on as if nothing happened other than a slight interruption.This is just a sample of the level of detail in this game. Hopefully this ""review"" will be enough to convince you to get this game. One thing is for certain, I'm gonna take these fascists to hell with me.			",70,2,0,11,5,0,5

												It is August 31st, 1942. Me and my comrades in the 124th Rifle Brigade move to a village on the outskirts of Spartanokva, just north of the Tractor Factory. We are untrained and inexperienced, but equiped and ready to defend our motherland to the last man. Stories from the 62nd Army state that a Soviet soldier will only withdraw once his ammunition is spent, the building is in ruins, and their clothes are on fire. We enter a the church of the village and pray to the God my country denies. The artillery bombardment begins, the floor begins shaking. Suddenly, our machine gunner spots germans and begins opening fire. He dies 5 seconds after. Some attempt to fire back at the Fascist invader, but they are gunned down as quick as the peek out. Smoke begins to cover the windows, the German infantry move in to take the church.A Fascist scum jumps through the breach in the wall, and I quickly fire a shot off into his chest. He hits the ground before he could get on the other side. Another meets the same fate. The 3rd does it, I miss the shot, he hits me in the left arm, but I bolt the rifle quick enough to use my 4th shot before he can finish me off. I proceed to bandage my wound, and when the task is completed, 10 germans have entered the church. I lay on the ground, 1 bullet in my magazine, 10 germans, and they havn't noticed me. I couldn't fire or they would know. I reached for my grenade and considered what I could do for my brothers who died killing the Fascist menace. I pulled the pin, and threw one at the far end of the church, and then pulled the pin on the second one before they could shoot me down. The church was cleared for now, but more Germans instantly reinforced and captured the church. I have died taking out 10 fascists with me, but my story will never be known, my sacrifice forgetten the moment after it happened. All witnesses will not make it out of the battlefield alive, and I had no family to mourn my death, as they have all been killed at the hands of the Germans.10/10, Will turn you into a zealous nationalistic jihadist.

												Where do I start with this review? Let's start with a story. One of my teammates and I wanted to cross a street and we were deciding who would go across the street first. My teammate ended up going across first. He was about mid-way when a machine gun opened up on him. He immediately went prone to bandage himself. That is when an enemy grenade flew through the air then blew his arms and legs off... 10/10 would get PTSD again.(It's a great game go buy it)			",27,1,1,0,11,0,5

												Forgot to write a review for this game!A game that has a bit a hard learning curve since there are a fair few keys to use, maps that are big and need to know where the objectives are and simply get familiar with them, but once you get the basics it start to become really fun and there is always something to learn as well as the game has a lot of depth.Finally the ranking system is great to progress but still has a nice shape to let skilled players stand out in the battlefield.One the finest wargames i have played for a while.5/5 rating			",95,58,3,4,15,3,3

												One of the best FPS games of the last couple of years. The gameplay offers the perfect blend between fast paced action (because of respawn waves) and realism. I cannot think of a better WW2 infantry (and tanking) game. The depth and detail in the game are amazing. Correct weaponry and classes guarantee an immersive environment. The community is one of the best ones out there, if you play on the more popular servers teamwork is usually guaranteed as people try to communicate and cooperate actively. All in all, you cannot go wrong with this title!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Reviewing only Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad  - i did not own Rising Storm. RO2 is the dream of any hardcore WW2 fan. The game features battles from World War 2 between germans and the russians in Stalingrad. But why is it so great? That's simple: Because of the way they created it. You will fight in small troups as either normal soldier (only equipped with a Rifle and a Grenade) or as a special class, equipped with extra equipement. Mg's, Sniper, Tank destroyers, elite soldiers [..] There are various classes to choose from. But all of them are limtied, just like it was back then. The majority of players will always end up in the Rifleman Class. And that's good!This is none of you usual run and gun games. It's a hardcore, challenging and very realistic team shooter. One shot to your chest? Likely dead. A shot to your arm? Well, yo can bandage that. A sniper bullet in your bottom? R.i.p. Gunplay is incredibly well made, reloading single bullets or clips is totally sufficient! The lack of an HUD just adds to the experience. The graphics are good! Not the best compared to today standards, but fitting to this kind of game. Dark atmosphere, dirty snow, dirty houses [...] Stalingrad lives again... The sound is one of the best i have ever experienced in an online shooter. While the normal shots are just your average sounds, its the overall package that makes it so great. Beeing shot at by an mg, jumping into cover, just to hear the player next to your dying slowly because he was hit by the bullets - you feel sad, angry and frightend. You don't want to peak out of cover when there is a sharpshooter ahead. You don't want to run through mg fire. You are afraid for your life. You are happy when you can get to the next trenches - it means there won't be anyoone able to snipe your head off. You will start to really feel like you are there, not just playing a game. The community is mostly very good! Roleplaying is not uncommon, neither is having great team leaders and commanders. Communication is proceeding smoothly, making it not only an fps, but also a strategical game. I could go on like this for hours, but let's just say: If you want a highly realistc, challenging world war 2 shooter, and don'tmind the high initial learning curve, this is for you! Buy it!

												(English isn't my first language...you've been warned! ;)I've been planing to do a RO2 review for quite some time now, but never really got around to do it...until now! This review might not be perfect or complete. But these are my thoughts about the game and yeah...here we go. As you might have guessed from the game's title, this fps takes place during WW2. There are two parts of it: vanilla RO2 on the european eastern front, where you fight as either Germany or the Soviet Union(goodies: tanks/vehicles, OOORAAAH!), and the pacific theatre of war expansion Rising Storm (goodies: flamethrowers/katanas, Baaanzaaaii!).Beware though: as RO2 is primarily a multiplayer title, the AI in both SP and MP is rather...sub optimal. It sucks. Therefore, instead of buying Heroes of Stalingrad for the SP content like a friggin moron (like me...), I HIGHLY recommend buying the Rsising Storm expansion, as it also happens to have ALL Heroes of Stalingrad MP maps so...yeah. No brainer :)But now! Enough with the theoretical nonsense and onto the ACTION! Huuza!

RO2 imo fills a very interesting niche between games like CoD (fast paced, very arcady FPS) and games like Arma 3 (veeery slow paced, big focus on realismn).Keep in mind: I realise there are more games out there than just these two, I only picked them as represantatives of two very different game design philosophies.So RO2 might be the perfect game for people who find CoD to be too much of the arcady bull**** it is (please excuse my Frensh here, but I really fu***** hate CoD) and Arma 3 to be too much...well, just too much. RO2 is still fast paced...you rarely ever have to walk more then 30 seconds to come within enemy contact, but one bullet can still drop you.Other features for example are a suppresion system which makes your aim go all over the place if somebody shoots you a lot as well as weapon unlocks/improvements for all classes/weapons.But what is it really all about? Well, there are several different game modes of which the most popular is ""Territory"". Ever played a round Battlefield Rush mode? Yeah, it's pretty much like that. Capture one Point (sometimes 2 or even 3 at the same time) after another and win the map! But keep an eye on both tickets and time! Both are limited, so the attacker needs to hurry! And the defender has to play it smart, otherwise the defending team might end up stalling the attack but ultimately running out of tickets(=lives/respawns), which creates a very interesting dynamic.I believe there are some other modes as well, but truth be told...I have never played anything else in over 400h RO2. There are also two different types of servers: campaing or rotation. On a campaing server the victorious team gets to choose if it wants to attack or defend and which territory / map to attack. On a rotation server...well...there is a fixed map rotation :DIf you still want to know about those modes--> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Red+Orchestra+2+Game+Modes Germany and Russia are fairly well balanced. Some might say the Russians have the upper hand in CQC, but that's not really the case. At least in my opinion. There is no real imbalance. However, some people keep saying that the fight between USA and Japan is soo unfair because US=OP. And on first glance it does seem that the US have better weapons, higher firepower etc. Example: the US rifleman gets a M1 Garand. That's a semi automatic rifle. The Japanese Rifleman however, only gets to play with either the Arisaka Type 99 or the Type 38, both are BOLT ACTION RIFLES. I could go into details of stoping power, range, accuracy yadda yadda. There are guides for this if you are really interested in stats like this(remember the 1 Bullet=Death rule?^^) . To sorta balance things out, most maps are designed for the US to be the attackers, so the Japanese have the advantage of being in the defense.I still recommend for new players to start as the US(maybe even on a campaign server) because their weapons are far more forgiving. Trust me. A quick guide on what makes the Japanese so uber awesome was made by WilliamTheTard-san:

Kicking♥♥♥♥♥and chewing sushi.yummy...Once you are ingame you will notice that there is a class system. The classes are ranging from the ordinary rifleman to extremly deadly flamethrowers.(oh, and tanks in stalingrad^^) There is a slot limit though with the majority of soldiers being said riflemen, so better be quick to grab that lovely MP40/Thompson!There is also a squad system and a team leader, but I won't go into any details here. Suffice to say: While squadleaders are mobile spawn points for their squads and therefore are IMMENSELY important in both offense and defense, the teamleader can call in recon planes (that shows enemy locations on the map even if it's not pin point accuracy) and can drop big fu***** artillery strikes on those poor souls of the enemy team who happen to find themselfes under an arty marker. Both SL (=squadleader) and TL (....exactly! Teamleader) get to choose from a lot of shiny weapons too. They are NOT however for storming the damn beaches of Iwo Jima on ur own, but for protecting urself from single enemy soldiers who want to kill you! SL and TL are very important for a team's success and a match's outcome is often not determined by individual skill, but by the coordination between TL and SLs. Oh, they also get smoke grenades(1 for SLs, 2 for TL) to screen the own team's advance.For the ordinary grunt, RO2 playes a lot like any other FPS. The controls are fluid and intuitive (WASD...), the cover system is total garbage though...don't you dare to use it. Once you get used to the increase of range (you'll find yourself shooting at guys 150m+ in the distance a LOT) and to the fact that you die every minute or so ;) there is really nothing to prevent you from having a BLAST. Except maybe teamkills...which DO happen a lot. Because, well...you fight over large distances, you have an itchy trigger finger and you DROP PEOPLE WITH ONE SHOT^^. But it's part of the game, it happens and it kinda is part of the fun too. Here is a little tip that will safe you A LOT of frustration: Allies (Russians, Americans) sprint with their weapons in front of their chest. In BOTH hands. Axis (Germans, Japanese) sprint with their weapons in their right hands only! Oh, did I mention RO2 has an ingame voice chat which people actually use to talk tactics and don't abuse the sh*t out of and try to be the most annoying little f**** there are?(except on Russian servers...I mean, I don't speak Russian but I recognise recordings of speeches/parades on the Red Square when I here 'em^^)  Yeah, the RO2 community is pretty awesome.If you are still with me after this DAMN wall of text and you survived my horrible English, there is really nothing that should prevent you from buying this game.Like right now.I mean it...it's awesome :)In case you want to see some ingame scenes first I picked a completly random LP from YT ( seriously...idk this guy), where you can see a defense on IWO JIMA on the Japanese side.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TPWR9qyM2EEDIT: He seems to be playing on an action server. Danger indicators, crosshair (only iron sights on realism) and ""killed from location"" are usually not in the game when you play RO2 these days.My final verdict: 9/10With that said, I wish you a lovely day. Much Fun. So skillz.			",69,4,0,8,4,0,21

												Red Orchestra 2 is a game created by Tripwire that was released in 2011 on UE3. The game is set in WW2 on the eastern front, hence the name Red Orchestra.To put it simply, it's a hardcore version of Battlefield. It's possible to kill anyone with a shot to the head or torso. Other than that the game is 32v32, features a ticket system from battlefield and most maps have a ""rush"" like game mode. That said, the games are very different, and that's mostly due to the fact how easy it is to die in Red Orchestra. This game forces you to think differently.In this game, you never run in the open in full height for example. You always go from cover to cover, preferably crouched. When you find a shooting position, you should try to have as much of your body behind cover. Really, in a lot of ways the game makes you feel as if you are in a real war, cause everybody will be acting as if they are in one.Why should you buy it?I suppose your first question is whether it is fun? It is in it's own right. It's quite a unique experience.Usually most maps are played with Attacker/Defender style. Defenders are given a few points on the map at a time, and must hold them. If they lose them, they get pushed back, and would have to defend a new set of points. Sort of like rush, except that you have flags instead.Unlike battlefield, the capture points are very big. Let's say the attackers need to take point, which happens to be a house - the capture point is the whole house. Why am i bringing it up? Cause i want to talk about camping. It's a tactic that will be commonly seen among defenders, but it's not your typical camping. You do not just sit in the corner. You have to correctly disperse your forces to fend off the attackers, and usually you are also given 2 points to defend at once.Attackers have it much harder on them, since they actually have to advance to win, but they also get more tickets.The game also has a very minimal UI. It's practically only your eyes and ears - no minimaps, no names over targets. In fact, friendly fire is turned on all servers, so one of the first things a beginner must do, is learn the difference between russians/germans and americans/japanese (their uniform).Red Orchestra 2 rolesRO2 does some things much better than Battlefield, for example classes. Each team has 1 commander, and multiple squads made of 10 players. A squad has squad leader and he acts as a mobile spawn point to his squad mates. Usually a team is given 4 squads. Yes, that's 40+ slots for 32 players - it was done on purpose. A team gets 1 team leader, 4 squad leaders, 4 machine gunners, 6 assault (automatic weapons), 1 sniper, a few more elite assault and elite riflemen, and the rest are normal riflemen. You cannot make everyone in your game medics, engineers, snipers etc. Instead there are roles, that increase in complexity.Normal riflemen have bolt action rifles, which are inferior to everything else in the game due to their fire rate, and pretty much 75% of the players will be playing as them.Elite riflemen have semi-auto weapons. Assault and elite assault have automatics. Each has their own role in the game that they must fulfill. These guys are there to fight in close quarters on the objective.Machine gunners are another class with automatic weapons, but they cannot aim with their machine gun until they station it - making them very inaccurate for close quarters, but good for defense. Their greatest strength is that they can shoot 50-200 rounds before having to reload.Usually a team gets 1-4 snipers max (depends on the map), and these are used to take out important roles such as team leaders, squad leaders and machine gunners. Unlike other roles, they can't spawn on the squad leader, so if they die, they will have to make it all the way from the base to the frontline.Squad leaders are a mobile spawn point for the 9 players in his team. It's very important for them to survive. Other than that they are the only role that has smoke grenades, which are commonly used in this game to block vision for the enemy and allow your men to charge in. They also have binoculars, which they can use to mark points on the map for artillery.Team leader is the one that is calling in artillery basically. He actually has the same gear as the squad leader - a sub machine gun, smoke grenades, he can mark with his binoculars as well, but he requires to be next to radios to do his job, like for calling artillery. The radios themselves are located on certain point on the map, and usually they are not where the action is.Some maps also feature tanks, and with them they bring engineers and AT gunners. Engineers are basically allowed to choose the gear that elite riflemen or assault use, and they get anti tank grenades. But their main job is to destroy obstructions, like tank barriers. AT gunners on other hand get a big anti material rifle, but just like machine gunners they have to station it.ImmersionLike i said, it also gives you great immersion, but it's more than what i described. There are a lot of things in the game that improve immersion even more. Stuff like this for example.

			This training mission 4 of the axis campaign of Red Orchestra 2. Thanks for watching!		

They modeled the whole interior of the tank, and even added animations for the crew members.A bit about tanks themselves. This is no battlefield - the tank can fit 2-4 crew members depending on the tank. Unlike battlefield again, the driver only does the driving for example. He has a very limited view by the way, as you can see over here.https://youtu.be/Lyrl49hCmqY?t=89Usually there is a tank commander, a turret gunner and an MG gunner. There is also a loader who is played by AI, but you can replace him if he dies. Not all tanks are the same though. They are like 4 currently - Panzer IV and T-34 were available on release, but Panzer III and a 2 seated T-70 were added later on.That said, unlike red orchestra 1, there is a lack of tank battles. There are only 3 maps for huge tank battles. Most of the time the tank is used to support the infantry.UI is very minimal as well. There is no indicators of how much ammo you have in your rifle for example. But you can check that by holding R, and your character will physically unbolt the rifle and check it. Little things like that make it very immersive.Rising StormIn 2013, Rising Storm was released - an expansion to RO2. It's set in the pacific and features american and japanese. It's basically the same game, except without tanks and it's asymmetric. Meaning one side is better than the other - americans get auto and semi auto weapons, while most of the japanese roles have bolt action rifles. Americans also get flamethrowers.It's a nice challenge for more experienced players and it's a great place to start learning the game. You also don't have to own the expansion to join the servers - the game allows people to play as a normal rifleman if they don't own it.Content and PlayerbaseJust gonna leave these 2 spreadsheets i made.https://imgur.com/mCI9XCjhttps://imgur.com/3OPxhdAJudge for yourself.The playerbase is rather weak 5 years after release unfortunately. Sometimes you find all servers empty and other times 3 full servers. People that play it are very mature though.ConclusionWell, i told you all i had to tell, the choice is up to you. It's a very hardcore game, but you never know, maybe you would like it.Also, do not that this game is entirely multiplayer. There is a campaign, but it's basically the multiplayer with bots. Same maps, same modes, but very dumb bots.If you do, please turn on ""bolt rifles manually"" and ""native languages"" for extra immersion.			",498,99,13,68,57,7,114

												So I'll avoid another review and instead offer advice for noobs where they're likely to read it.The community is generally welcoming but providing you follow two easy rules.1. Do NOT take the Team Leader position.2. Do NOT take a Squad Leader position.OK, 4 rules.3. Do NOT play this like COD. 4. Shout out that you're new and ask for advice. Many of us like to show off our experience so will gladly help when asked. Red Orchestra is a team game, played over a number of battles in a campaign (usually). A TEAM game. As an example, if you're a points ♥♥♥♥♥, the top of the leader board is the person with the most TEAM points. NOT highest number of kills. Team points can win games.The issue with those two roles, TL and SL, is they have to be played properly if the team is to win. And TL, and preferably SL's, need a microphone and experience. So thats it. Do not got TL or SL  until you have a lot of experience OR .. you're willing to tell the team you are new and want advice. Then listen and follow. Also be aware of the role you pick or are allocated. MG's usually move to the flanks and provide cross covering fire. Keeping the enemies heads low. Accuracy and kills is actually less important than scaring the enemy. Make them keep their heads down. When you get low on Ammo shout out using your command keys .. ask for ammo and riflemen should bring it to you.Snipers .. your job is to take out enemy MG's and Squad Leaders. Anyone else is just going to give your position away for little benefit.Tanks ... always operate best with a crew who communicate with microphones. Use the 6 key to swap between shell types. AP for armour, HE for everything else. Remember that you have 2 mgs. One in the hull, one parrallel with the main gun. commander, stay inside the tank. You are an easy target.  Driver, hatch closed.SL's, including Tank SL. You have 5 jobs. Do them and your team might win.1. Stay alive. DO NOT DIE. DO NOT BE A HERO. If you want points, do your job. You can get to the top of the leader board without firing a round. 2. Mark artillery targets. If attacking, locate it just past a cap, preventing the enemy from entering. If defending, in a position in the cap furthest away from you .. ie where they enter the cap.  There are many variations of this on the different maps. Learn them. Always be thinking ahead to the next cap point and try to get your marks in early so your TL isn't waiting. You get team points for any enemy killed by artillery.3. You are a mobile spawn point for your squad. Get close to the cap and stay down. Stay alive. Your squad can spawn next to you rather than all the way back at the previous spawn. this enable syou to quickly cap and advance. 4. Smoke.  You start with one smoke and can pick a second at the nearest ammo point. Use it to keep your squad alive. Position it to alllow them to get into caps safely. Not too far away so as to be of little use. You are their surrogate father. Look after them. Keep them safe. Its possible to use smoke in defence but it has to be done VERY carefully so as not to block your line of fire or benefit the enemy. 5. Talk to your squad. (Press T to find out who they are, Press I to chat to just them). Encourage them, instruct them. Tell them where to expect arty, when you're popping smoke etc. Organise them so you can mount a strong attack. TL .. you need to be talking to your team constantly. Letting us know when and where arty will drop. Which area to attack and when NOT to attack. You need to call in recon at the appropriate time, instructing your SL's to check their maps and provide new updated marks if required. You HAVE TO STAY next to the radio while the recon plane is up other wise enemies are not shown on th emap. If you need to support an attack in a certain way then tell you SL's where you want their marks. Keep a constant eye on the chat and relay any important infor to the team (thats why you need a microphone). Anti Tankers .. clue is in the name. You keep the team safe from tanks. If you don't do your job and instead decide to go sniping, your team will get slaughtered. DESTROY TANKS.Engineers ..  you destroy tanks and tank barricades. When attacking you make a path for YOUR tank with the satchel. Blow fortifications to cripple defenders or alow ingress. When defending you destroy enemy tanks but your're also tasked with defending baricades etc. from enemy engineers.  It's your job to STOP them from being blown up.Assault .. as it says .. when attacking your are the main thrust of the attack. Auto Riflemen .. you are essentially an assault with greater range. Riflemen .. You provide cover for the assault squads .. forcing the enemy to hide.  You then follow the assault into the cap and help consolidate. You then hold and defend the cap while the assaulters move onto the next cap, again providing them with cover and preparing to move on again once the assaulters have nearly secured the cap.You can also resupply MG's. Walk, run or crawl up to them and press USE. This is an essential job since if an MG has to run back for ammo they're both at isk and leaving you without vital support.Always use transports when provided. They allow you to follow up an attack much faster and to concentrate forces where needed. Therefor, never drive off in a transport on your own. Always wait until its mostly full. Enemy recon planes can be shot down. Russian is a bi-plane, German mono. It loses them team points and recon info.Team Kills, TK's, happen. they just do. If you TK, say sorry. If you're TK'd and the person says sorry, type np  (no problem), the TK will be forgiven, the person won't be kicked and your team will get a point .. because you were nice. Always forgive, np, TK's by arty .. it's usually your fault.I could waffle for hours but I'll leave it at that.  It's a fantastic game once you get into it and understand how to play it to it's best.			",27,2,1,4,25,0,26

												Well now i believe you'll surely got tired of all those ""modern"" multiplayer shooters, following COD's logic in nearly everything, it's the circle of♥♥♥♥♥♥that never stop. However Red Orchestra get so many things right from the beginning, im talking about that whole atmosphere of war, weapon handling and with that music orchestra constantly playing in your ear, even on shity server with shity players everything feels so epic. But this game know definition of broken and so many things needs to be fix before more players lose interest. We need more games like this, period			",227,28,1,19,11,2,23

												When I first read the reviews for this game, I was shocked to find that some people were horrified by the results of this games purchase. I needed to find out for myself how realistic this games really is. As I opened up the game I was greeted by a simple and effective main menu. I figured I would play the training to see if I was walking into something complicated. I was happy to see that the game wasn't too crazy. I jumped into my first match to find myself accidentally walking into the middle of a massive fire fight only to be massacared by the enemy team. I figured I should change to a marksman to avoid the frontline fire. As I mounted up in an apartment window, I found myself doing much better as I was starting to fix my k/d and actually started supporting my team. I realized the horrible killing machine I had become as I had looked over myself after the match. I first got my PTSD from a event that will never leave my mind, it gave me nightmares. I was sniping from a window when I spotted two people acting as if they had never seen each other in years. I trained my scope in on the man on the right and pulled the trigger, sending a piece of sharp, refined metal from my barrel right into the man's right temple. As the blood flew from the man's head into his friends mouth and face, I felt no emotion as I saw the man on the right freak out into burst of emotion that would send him to his knee's beside his friends lifeless body. I shot the man in the knee sending him into imense pain. I walked over to this man and as he begged for mercy and as stood there I pulled out my mauser and shot him in the forehead. The blood flew from his head like a watermelon, sledge hammer collision. Even though I have only played this game for 0.7 hours, I already have PTSD and am shaking while writing this. This game is a must buy.10/10 Would get PTSD again.			",114,7,1,9,16,0,22

												This game desevers more praise then it already has!Playing the first 30 minutes and I was haveing fun(with bots then later players)first 2 hours this game made me cry. Its so real the emotinal depth to this game means something to me ive never seen a FPS game that made me almost cry from playing the multiplayer.Ive played battlefield and none of those moments in that game made me feel like the way this game does.Ive played call of duty Black ops 1-3 and none of those have never inpressed in the time this has.Although when I was 5 call of duty 3 and 2 made me cry.Ive played alot of FPS games but this one is just awsome haveing to be considerite of your ammo and bleed effect and barrel change and leaning and F*CK IT ITS AWSOME! I recomend you pick this one up and try it The music is so fitting (thats one reason I cried)Its just so fitting and just fits.This game doesnt need a single player campaining becuase its just that griping.I was playing as the japineese and the germans most of the time but I still managed to sympothy for them and the other team the dioluge is great the screams the crys of pain mean something to me.Best Ww2 game ive ever played!10/10Lets hope riseing storm 2 will have the same effect on me.Ps Im crying right now.

												You were shot in an instant second. You were hurt. You were seriously injured. You knew that moment.... that moment you cannot be dead in this horrifying war. You know you can't be DEAD. Death, is the story of your life, with no value, except that you were dying.You thought inside, deeply 'If I die, and I haven't done anything, then I have no value to die. But... If I heal myself, and get off my♥♥♥♥♥on the ground, and be a hero, then I know that I have value to die.'You healed yourself. You started to feel a little bit better, despite being shot in the arm. You looked around. So many of your friends were tearing their parts away, exploded, screaming in pain, crying, yelling....You knew that if you die, all of these things that you see around you will continue. You had to stop that. You knew you had to stop it.So, you got off your♥♥♥♥♥on the ground... Lots of bullets were flying to you, but you were not getting them. That moment, it was so close. But you had to carry on. The rest is.... is up to you - either you die easily, or you become a truly hero of this horrifying war. :)			",30,1,0,2,7,0,0

												--------The Following Narrative Actually Happen in Red Orchestra 2-----------------------------Bridges of Druzhina - 1942--------------Russians...Russians are everywhere. They took objective A, B, and C so quickly that our fellow soliders began to panic. My Honor Rank is 73 and a squad leader for Squad Two. I ordered my men to fall back to Objective G, the outskirts of Druzhina, and command them to fortify the position. Squad One fought valiantly against the Russians on Objective D, but most of them were wiped out. The dense forest that cover Objective D and E favor the Russians than our German forces. The Bolsheviks were clever to use smoke grenades to advance their position while our men fired wildly into the thick, white smoke. What are they shooting at? Who knows. As Objective E was spammed with Russians, the commander order the squad leaders, including me, to send in artillery coordinates. Unfortunately, there were too many artillery requests sent to the commander. The first coordinate is at the Russians on Objective E, the second coordinate is pointed directly at the Russian T-34, and the third coordinate was sent in close to Objective G. I was the one who sent in the third coordinate. I debated with my commander that the third coordinate is the best because the Russians would most likely be sending 2/3 of their forces to take G. The commander didn't listen and called the artillery at the first coordinate. As the artillery roars the sky and slams into the ground, the Russians were clever to run away from Objective E. Some of them died while the rest who were at Objective E rush to Objective G in a frontal assault. The machine gunner in my squad, whose Honor Rank is 58, fired his MG-34 in a control burst, but was killed by a sniper from 148 meters. I watch the machine gunner got shot and his body slump into the fragile, wooden floor. I was traumatized by this and order my men to not be exposed by the window. The rest of my squad consist of newer members, ranging the Honor Rank from 12 - 36 didn't listen to my command. The second squad member (Honor Rank - 26) was killed by the same sniper. Two squad members killed and the Russians are swarming in front of the sandbags near Objective G...and I have to make a choice. I ordered my squad to suppress fire at the Russians while waiting for additional reinforcements to come and defend Objective G. Unfortunately, the Bolsheviks pulled a hard, right flank at Objective F, wiping out Squad Three in under 20 seconds. Even though my squad was able to pluck a few kills around Objective G, the Russians purposely made this frontal assault as a distraction so that their comrades can take Objective F. Knowing that Objective G would be overrun from the right side, I ordered my lower ranking members to retreat back to the apartments in Objective I. Strangely, there were signs of courage and fury in my men's eyes. One of the squad members (Honor Rank - 21, Anti-Tank class) demanded me to let him risk his own life as the T-34 rushes to the main road that leads to Druzhina. I refused in his request and ordered him to tactically withdraw, but he didn't listen. Before I was about to demand an order to him, he pulls out the Hafthohlladung anti-tank grenade and runs directly in front of the T-34. He starts to scream and was about to swing the grenade, but was mowed down in a hail of machine gun fire from the Russians. However, I heard an explosion and I took a slight peak in the window. The T-34's main gun was pointing in front of me and the last I said to my men is: Run! This is Red Orchestra 2. ------------------------------Review----------------------------Red Orchestra 2 is the ultimate first-person tactical shooter that advocate very strong team coodination and communication, complex cover system, and each life (or ticket) is precious. When playing as the Russian, German, American, or Japanese, each solider fight just to survive. There will be instances in the game that discourage reckless assaults or exposure to the enemy. You will learn the game by experience and not repeating the same mistakes twice. There are weapons, class, and character rankings that encourages replay value. The best experience you will get in Red Orchestra 2 is playing on a full server. You will hear the best team coordination, the best varieties of newer and veteran players, and the greatest responsibility for your own life and theirs. Red Orchestra 2 does not shy away from the actuality of war as you will hear meeps, horrific groans, and the development of post-traumatic stress disorder. There is no ""I"" in war; there is brother and comrade. Red Orchestra 2 is simply, the best tactical first-person shooter to ever develop.			",158,20,2,21,16,2,40

												I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME AND THE COMMUNITY!-Constantly New Maps and Mods rolling out - ALL FREE! which dramatically increases scope and gameplay. -INTENSE COMBAT! You will have PTSD after this, It is not COD no running in a maze. This is not CS Crap GO. 1 Shot and your pretty much dead. -You pick up Russian pretty quick. DA COMRAD! PABEDA DLA SEABYAHH!! - Team work and cordination wins the round. Only thing bad I can say is sometimes you will get unbalanced teams that just WRECK the goat cheese out of moral and will make you rage quit.  Also the only indication of enemy is their uniform, newbies get a lot of teamkills. \One of my favortie moments was when I was US in Pacific campaign, I snuck up on an enemy jap, stabby stabby, stole his Katan, and then ran around pretending to be a jap. No one shot me because they know US soldiers wont have a katana raised above their heads. I quitely ran into a dark dark house and stood in a small closet walkspace, with my katana raised and ready to do battle. An enemy soldier walks in, and quitely walks through the dark dark house. The only light he could see was the reflection of the moon on my raised blade. By then it was too late as I Miseroogeed his face with a quick choppy chop chop. He dropped, and I returned to my position in the dark, his buddy hearing his comrads last squeek quickly ran into the house and ran past me searching for who ever killed his friend. He quickly found out.. but only for a split second. This earned me a KILL BILL achivement- 10/10 will KILL BILL again.			",53,3,1,10,12,0,8

												Best $5 that I ever spent on steam, have played many more hours than the 140 I have on steam on a disc copy.  This game, to sum it up frankly, is the greatest shooter game I've played in my entire life.  It blends together perfectly; from the firefights, to the the crawling in the muddy trenches, to ''HURRAH'' charging as the Soviets towards certain death in the form of a MG34 machine gun, to watching your buddies get shot in the stomach and bleed out all the while screaming in agony, to sprinting from broken tree to shell crater dodging fire.  This game has it all, a perfect blend of hardcore and tactical shooterBUTI have yet to reveal this games most outstanding quality.  This game does something that very few other games can do (I can count on my hand the number of other games that compete with this game in this aspect), and that is to create teh atmosphere of war.  Red Orchestra 2 does this better than any game in my opinion.  DISCLAIMERThis game will give you PTSD, no doubt.  I remember the first time that I played it and jumped into a game and selected the Rifleman class.  I (foolishly) charged around towards the river on Bridges and saw my friend get hit directly by an Anti-tank rifle, removing his legs.  I was in shock and continued running only to be hit by a mortar shell and be dismembered.  I took a second and realized that this game was nothing like any other game that I had played; I legitemately felt fear.  I was terrified to poke my head out of the trench, only to get killed by a rifleman.  I was scared to run from crater shell to crater shell, with bullets whizzing all around me. I was horrified to find that grenades inside houses do not bode well for the occupants.  #bestPTSDsimulator2k16This game... what else can be said about this game.  It is fantastic in every element, although being a few years dated (2013).  I will continue to play this game until the next one comes out, Rising Storm 2 Vietnam, but even then I'm sure that I will keep coming back to this one.  In closing, I give this game a perfect score of 10.0/10.0.  Two thumbs up, absolutley perfect.  I wouldn't change anyting in this game and for the love of God, buy this game. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most realistic WW2 shooter on the market so far! I simply love this game, and I do not like most fps. Finally a game that you cannot win by running/jumping around like mad, this only gets you killed within seconds. You have to be careful, snipe and cooperate with your teammates to be successful. I love the graphics, the sound, the realism, the gameplay, even (a large part of) the community. Different weapons, (for a fps) long weapon reload times, limited ammo, severed body parts, even tanks to drive around - all I ever wanted!			",2445,1048,101,338,327,27,459

												Red Orchestra 2 is wonderful.The ""psudo-realism"" setting that most Modern-era FPS have taken is vexing.  A gaming experience shouldn't require much suspension of disbelief.Team Fortress 2 is a great game for its cartoon fantasy setting, allowing us to imerse ourselves in the gameplay world.Call of Duty on the other hand takes a ""realistic graphic/settings"" approuch, but keeps gameplay highly casual (i.e. health regen, invincible humans, no recoil, unbelievable events, ect.) and fails utterly!RO2: Heroes of Stalingrad on the other hand upholds a deep commitment to realistic gameplay to match its unique real-world setting, the bloodest and most interesting infantry conflict of all time, the Battle of Stalingrad.The game was pushed out early which means lots of bugs and critic reviews that are less prasing than it deserves, but Tripwire has proved itself to be a company commited to ongoing development with loads of free content and performance improvements down the line.

												One of my favourite ever shooters. I bought this game for about £3 - the price of a pint of beer. What a buy it was. It has provided me with hundreds of hours of gritty, immersive and extremely atmospheric gameplay. I love this game because it rewards noble gameplay: Patience, perseverance, precision, wit - compared to the homogenised, soft - edged generic excuses for FPSs that we are now spoon fed. Yes, at first you will get shot from 150m countless times by someone you think must be invisible or hacking. Yes you will be frustrated at constantly being blown in to disgusting flesh lumps by artillery. Yes you will be annoyed that you can't be a sniper every match and are forced to use a boring bolt action rifle with iron sights. However once you master the rifleman class the whole game starts to fall into place and you will realise that this is one of the best and most ""different"" tactical experiences you have ever had.9.5/10 I love this game and would absolutely recommend it if you are an experienced FPS player looking for more depth. However if you are a 14 year old with no patience, don't even bother.			",33,0,1,2,1,0,2

												After searching and searching, i have finally found a WWII game that is nearly perfect. In my opinion, it's my most favorite fps up to date. I rate it above Battlefield 4 and CoD 4 and put it next to BF:BC2. The only thing that they need to do now is come out with a Red Orchestra game for Vietnam with vehicles and everything and my life would be complete. The combat in this is spot on and much more dynamic and responsive than other FPS games I've played. Unlike BF4, you can actually play at 150 ping on a server and have no lag. I've had no problems with hit detection at all. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this game a 9.7. The only thing it's missing is more vehicle accessible maps and airplane combat. That would make this a full WWII experience. I'll probably play this game more than I have played other FPS's. It's definitely worth picking up for 20 dollars. It's an amazing WWII game.

												I was a fresh recruit, it was September 21 1944. It was six days into the assault on Peleliu.  I arrived with my best friend Daniel Krane. I've known him since grade school. We were devil dogs, 1st division. We were set on sentry duty, I heard a rustling in the trees I called out. No one answered, so we got this skinny fella, named Tony? Told him to light it up with the 30. In the mornin we took a look. It was our own guys. They were just taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥ my first instance of death and blood shed. We went on patrol a few days later. Our radio operator, some kid from a Philadelphia. He took a shot from a sniper in the trees. We got the poor Jap. We came upon a bunker our Sarg ordered to burn em out.  So we lit em up with flame throwers. Dan and I were ordered to clear out any survivors. The smell of burning flesh stung my nose. The thought these guys I have family's and now their charred remains couldn't be identified. As I went to leave I heard screaming in the tunnel. I sprinted towards the sound, I break into the corridor. I see Dan on the ground with a katana in him. I froze up the officer looked at me. ""Tenno Heika Banazi!"" He yelled. I came to my senses raised my M1 Garand and shot him. Right in the bridge of his nose, filled with rage I unloaded the rest of the clip into him. Even after it ejected I kept pulling the trigger. At night I always see Dan's face filled with fear.10/10 would get shell shock again.			",51,5,0,4,2,0,1

												This is by far the best WW2 game I have ever played. The Realistic mode (No UI/HUD + More Damage) is awesome. The environment, the atmosphere, the teams, everything is pretty well connected. The sound of the guns is incredible. I'm glad TWI is going to develop another Rising Storm game because this is awesome. Totally recommendable for everyone. 10/10! I almost get the feeling of PTSD of the people who fought on that war.

												1)       It was 1943. My friend and I were holding the Russian front against the invading Nazi forces. They had us pinned down to our last territory. We held off the Germans and prepared a counter attack. Our counter attack was so strong we brought the war to the pacific front and we turned into Americans. TL;DR: Fought so hard we switched campaigns.2)      The Germans were invading one of our cities, so I led my squad in the defense. There were two adjacent courtyards they were heavily open to enemy fire. I led my squad into a trench bordering the courtyards, and lost many in the process. My remaining friend and I go prone in the trenches dreading the inevitable German attack. Outside, about 20 yards from us, we heard a Panzer rolling across the ground. My remaining friend pulled out a satchel charge, and looked at me, and in that look we both knew what had to be done. I threw a smoke at the Panzer, and under the cover of the smoke my friend ran up to the tank and placed the charge, destroying the tank. However, before he could return to our position, he got ripped apart by enemy snipers. Shoutout to Karl XII for being a true war hero and ultimately winning the campaign for the Russian army. He will not be forgotten.                                           Best war game ever, hyper realistic, 1943/10			",111,20,2,18,19,1,25

												Red Orchestra 2, or RO2, is an amazing game. It is, by far, my favourite shooter, because of its stunning grahpics, amazing visual effects, and great audio. It also stays true to the historical events of WW2, and is set around 1941, during Operation Barbarossa, with Soviet Soldiers clashing with the German invaders. The game also features vehical combat, which is a nice touch. There is a large ammount of weapons in the game, too, which are, for the most part, well-balanced. The majority of the maps in the game are quite vast and open, save for a few close-quarters combat maps. Red Orchestra 2 is all about tactics. The Team Leader is a key asset to every team, as he can call in artillery strikes and recon planes. Squad Leaders are important because they are a mobile spawn point for any player of the team. Riflemen and submachine gunners are the main fighting force for either side. Marksmen usually hide in bushes like the cykas they are and pick off enemies from a distance. And engineers can stop a tank in its tracks. But every class plays a key role in leading their team to victory.In summary, Red Orchestra 2 is a phenomenal game with a few minor flaws that are made up for by the amazing gameplay, visuals, audio effects, and realism. It's a great game, and anyone who hasn't played it should give it a try.PS, if you're a rookie player, be sure to have a keen eye, or you'll get shot by some unnatural force that you cannot see.PS again, Soviets have the best rifle in the game and Germans have the best SMG.

												PROS:- A lot of WW2 weapons and using them feels nice- Pretty authentic WW2 experience with four sides to choose from (Japanese vs Americans, Russians vs Germans)- No spray patterns :), but you must take the distance and recoil into account- Class/role based and, as you gain XP, you improve your stats for weapons and classes- The game is not limited to shooting only (rifleman, elite rifleman, assault, elite assault, marksman, anti-tank, machine-gunner), but you can also lead and command a squad (squad leader), operate a tank (tank commander, tank crewman), disable tank traps (engineer) or even command all the battlefield for your team (multiple tactical support options for a commander). Not all roles are available for all game types.- Several gametypes (objective based or just shooting) and three rulesets (realism, classical and action). Action is the casual mode (crosshair, reduced damage, run and shoot pace) and realism is the ""real mode"" (one shot kills, bleeding damage, no crosshair, no ammo counter). Classical is similar to realism, but without zoom on iron sights and bleeding out. But I can comment on the classical mode only from what I've read on the forums, as it seems that classical mode servers are dead.- Very detailed and interesting maps, offering different approaches to engage the combat.- Cover system, grenade cooking and blind firing makes the gameplay options more variable- Even if you are not a very good player, you have your chances to excel. This game is not punishing for inexperienced players, as, for example, Insurgency or Counter-Strike. However, the skills still matter and the more you learn, the better you become.CONS:- Limited number of active players (1000-1500) and usable servers- Annoying bot behaviour (circling on the spot, blocking the sight for team members, not adjusting to the team)- Unadjusted respawns - spawning in front of enemies or behind the enemy line is common- It feels rather chaotic. Although the large number of players + bots allow to score many kills and accelerates the gameplay, the team members do not coordinate their actions very well.- Some maps offer exploits for sniping and its noticeable that some players prefer certain maps for that reason during map voting- Rather clumsy transitions between entering cover, exiting cover, crouching and proning- Quite a few glitches (seeing through objects/players; getting stuck until you press ESC, problems with proning or taking cover, not being able to use chat, etc.)This game is rather complicated and it has a rather steap learning curve, but from the four multiplayer shooters that I've recently played (CS:GO, Insurgency, America's Army: Proving Grounds and this one), Rising Storm feels the most balanced. It's like a middle ground between ""casual shooters"" and ""hardcore shooters"" and I like it that way.It suits well enough both for weekend action and hardcore skill building.My overall rating: 7/10.

												This game is one of the most realistic and intense as well as immersive out there trust me..Everything feels realistic,from gun feeling and handling to the maps and the its historical accuracy..I got almost 400 hours in the past 6 months playing with lots of cool guys..The little dissadvantage is the low ammount of  vanilla maps and generally it doesnt have as much content as Ro1 does and most of the maps tend to be too linear for 64 players..But if everything else is awesome..If you ever liked to play a realistic and historically accurate game,this is the one!

												Well Red Orchestra. I had so much fun with this game. community, gameplay, atmosphere, musics, soldier responds. They were all great. I played most FPS games on PC and consoles, and I can assure you this one is the best. Red Orchestra is the true first-person shooter that people deserve, not those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ casual FPS games which I'm not gonna name them and you already know what kind of games I'm talking about.The stupid thing is I went and wasted my time on those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nonsense FPS games. But I'll never make that mistake again, never.The reason I recommend Red Orchestra is obvious, this is the most hardcore realistic FPS game that ever made imo, every class and role on this game has a reason, a commander can lead their team to success, a squad leader can make it possible to capture/defend an objective with smoke and squad spawn, a machine gunner can support his team with suppress fire, an sniper can bang enemy machine gunner, an assault soldier can go forward with his SMG and clear a room of riflemen. And the last and most important class which I spent 100 hours on is riflemen. They are the most effective soldiers in battlefield. They are the one who capture and defend the objective.Red Orhestra is the game that devs made with love, and we can see it in the game. I do 100% recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a hardcore and realistic FPS game.And my last word is, I wish more people get attracted to this game.			",94,8,5,17,9,0,5

												The most entertaining multiplayer fps so far that has just the right amount of realism (this review is based on 'Realism' -mode of the game). Getting shot gets you killed (or disabled which is the same as killed in game terms) most of the time, depending on the weapon you get shot with: higher caliber weapons drop you with more certainty while pistols require more accuracy. Getting shot in the head or the heart (yes, the game lets you know where you were hit) kills anyone instantly. If you get lucky enough to survive a shot, you must spend a few seconds bandaging the wound or you will bleed out and die (yeah, not very realistic but very entertaining and exciting gamewise!). Also, sometimes you survive being shot for the few moments it takes you to bleed out from a serious wound that you cannot bandage: your screen starts to go black and you can no longer move, aim, reload or switch weapons. You can empty your current weapon in the general direction of the enemy sometimes getting lucky enough to hit them. Heroic effort, that! Nothing can save you from dying in this state, however. The game simulates suppression by turning the screen gradually black and white while a loud thumping of your own heart can be heard. This indicates your soldier panicking in the midst of an artillery barrage (which causes the most suppression in the shortest amount of time), getting shot at (bullets hitting near you gradually make you panic) and finally fellow soldiers getting hit and dying near you. In game terms, you aim is lowered by the additional weapon sway and the screen effects make it harder (not impossible, just more difficult) to aim accurately. The two sides (US and Imperial Japanese) are balanced in a way that - despite their numerous differences - offer a different experience in gameplay. Both sides have a set of limited roles ranging from the single team leader, several squad leaders, machine gunners, assault troops, snipers and an indefinite amount of riflemen up to the team size of 32 players. In addition the US get flamethrowers, and engineers carrying trench guns, while the Imperial Japanese have 'Knee-mortar' -soldiers. Also the technology of the time is - to my knowledge - displayed accurately: the US soldiers are equipped with semi-automatic weapons (M1) most of the time while the Imperial japanese troops have to make do with their bolt action rifles (Type 38, Type 99). In some maps, like Guadalcanal, the US troops have bolt-action rifles (Springfield) as well since the M1-Garands had not yet been delivered to them (as is historically accurate). All in all, the US have more firepower at their disposal at any given time.In return, the Imperial Japanese troops have bayonets from the beginning (which the US soldiers lack until upgraded) and they can banzai charge - resulting in higher suppression resistance - causing suppression in the enemy the more soldiers are joined in the charge - and the ability to withstand more hits than usual (headshots and shots through the heart kill instantly, as normally). The US troops suffer from suppression more easily than the Imperial Japanese troops. Japanese officers also get katanas, which are a cool way of disposing opponents. In terms of weaponry, the Imperial Japanese soldiers can use their grenades as booby traps: 2 can be in place at the most by a single soldier at any given time. If you plant a third, the first one disappears. Yeah, again not very realistic but it balances the game. The booby traps can be seen plainly if placed on an open terrain with no vegetation and they can be detonated by shots, grenades or artillery fire. US soldiers walking over or very near one detonate it and most often die instantly while the Imperial Japanese soldiers can walk over them without triggering them. An US soldeir can, however shoot at a booby trap to detonate it in the face of any enemy soldiers (there's actually an achievement for this!).  The knee-mortar (as inaccurately named by US troops of the time; some poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s actually tried firing it from their knee, often  breaking their thighbone as a result) is basically a grenade launcher which must be setup prior firing. It can be deadly in accurate hands but is often a cause of accidental team kills among new players trying it, don't get discouraged if this happens and remember to apologize for team kills! A knee-mortar soldier gets 5 grenades to shoot at respawn, which can be replenished once at a single supply point like any other ammunition. The flamethrower that the US  have, is a weapon feared by many Imperial Japanese players. A mere touch of its flames will kill you almost instantly and the flames fill a bunker quickly and completely leaving nothing alive inside. In contrast, the fuel runs out rather quickly, the range is limited,  and the US soldier carrying it is perhaps the most targeted soldier among enemy troops. Both sides' team leaders must coordinate with their squad leaders to bring down artillery fire on, or near the enemy. This mostly acts as an area denial behind capture points so that the defending or attacking players are denied access to secure it. Soldiers finding themselves inside a barrage must get out of there quickly or get killed by the blasts: the game mechanic of artillery kills anyone inside the area over time. If you're very lucky, you can survive for a few seconds to run into safety. The game has a honor system with ranks starting from 0 (new players) and ending in 100 - the highest rank available. The honor rank is account based and it is shown on a 'kill list' rotating on the upper right corner of the display (who killed who, how and where the shot it if a vulnerable spot) whenever you die or kill an opponent. You never know where the shot came from (unless you actually saw it your field of vision) as the camera locks instanly as you are killed so you can not look around to spot the enemy while dead. The individual roles on a side (rifleman, machinegunner, squad leader etc.) get experience (team points) points based on performance in battle: staying near you squad leader or team leader grants you extra team points whenever you kill someone or help capture an objective (which in itself grants several points). Also extra points are awarded for killing someone FROM the object zone and even more if the TARGET was in the object zone as well. Normally, you get 2 ream points from a kill and -2 for a team kill. A team kill can be forgiven by a player by saying 'np' in the public chat (the 'np' is not shown in actual chat) which removes the penalty from the player who caused it. It is generally polite to apologize for team kills and forgive them if the player causing it apologized. Sometimes you can guess with almost certainty that a team kill was an accident. Sometimes you just make the mistake of running into an area where someone just said they'd throw a grenade at or the team leader announced that the artillery barrage would strike in: in these cases you should own your mistake and 'np' immediately, especially in the case of team leader's artillery barrage which could result in numerous team kill penalties quickly. If you get enough team kills, whether accidental or not, you get kicked from the match and can't rejoin until the map changes. Respawns in the game are periodic (a rotation of 16 seconds, I think) simulating waves of reinforcements arriving. The team leader has a limited ability (with a cooldown period) to instantly respawn all dead players. Both teams have a set number of tickets which dwindle as players keep dying. If the tickets reach zero, spawn protection is disabled and no more respawns can take place. Maps are also time limited and failure by the attacking team to capture an objective will eventually result in a lockdown period of 3 minutes during which they must capture the point or lose despite the time left on the map's time counter.

												     Red Orchestra 2 is a World War 2 FPS which focuses on the eastern front. It mainly revolves around the bitter street fighting in the streets of Stalingrad and contrasts it with the openess of the surrounding steppes. RO2 scratches a multiplayer itch that no other competitive multiplayer game can quite get. It mixes small unit tactics and teamwork with high intensity and very authentic gunplay. The man who runs and guns in this is the man who gets shot first. Along with the authentic gameplay comes a steep learning curve. To those who tough it out RO2 is a multiplayer favorite and is an undeniably excellent game. Starting off with the core gameplay mechanics, RO2 attempts to; and arguably suceeds at; creating a tactical and authentic multiplayer experience that forces players to confer with their team in, at least a basic manner. The team with better communication generally comes out on top. Communication is especially crucial to the commander, who can call in off-map suppourts such as recon and artillery suppourt. These suppourts rely on coordiantes supplied by squad leaders and the platoon commander, thusly making teamwork a nessesity to win. Classes also play an improtant role. Given that M4 carbines are not the norm in World War 2, every weapon is more specialized. Riflemen are your typical grunts equipped with a bolt action rifle. These rifles are incredibly lethal and accurate making the rifleman key to providing suppourt to the other classes. Maachine gunners shut down kill zones and provide an alley for others to advance. Squad leaders assist the commander in providing coordinates and can use somke to conceal movement. Assaults get down and dirty in the ternches and go head on with the enemy with a sub machine guns. AT riflemen and Engineers provide a way to counter enemy armour at long and short range respectivley. These classes create a dynamic of cooperation between teammates, not one class dominates the battle. Gunplay is deliberate and lethal, One shot from any weapon has the potential to kill freind or foe. This gunplay makes short range combat flurried and confusing, while having long range engagments become a test of finesse and awareness. all of this gameplay is nicley wrapped in an atmospheric and compelling presentation. You crawl in dirty trenches to avoid rifle fire and artillery, knowing one well placed shot will end your life. The soundtrack potrays the mood of the battle, spurring you to action or spiraling into self loathing for losing to your opponent. Soldiers around you vocalize showing distain for their sub-human enemies, cowering in fear after coming under fire or writhing in pain while bleeding out after taking a round to the chest. The only real complaints regarding RO2 are it's steep learning curve, useless single player and some map glitches. The learning curve may turn some people off though once you get past it, RO2 is an experience that no other FPS can offer.			",203,30,1,13,21,0,19

												I don't play many shooters anymore, I found that they had started to feel pretty identical, and the gameplay was too shallow, and most posssessed horrid communities (I'd really rather not have some kid yelling ""♥♥♥♥♥♥"" into the mic, not cool dude). Red Orchestra is different. The gameplay actually requires you to think, take cover, and play intelligently, and the assault/defense gameplay encourages close co-operation and teamwork. A match on a full server is one of the most intense shooter experiences out there. Bullets whiz by your head, artillery explodes around you and you're desperately clinging to a little piece of cover firing shots off at advancing Germans/Russians, you watch as the guy in your squad next to you gets shot in the face as he moves to advance, but then that friendly tank moves into view blasting away the infantry ahead allowing you to charge forward with a hurrah. Capturing a well defended point feels like an actual accomplishment. Plus, the community is friendly and I've yet to have someone yell ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at me over the mic.			",184,51,3,62,49,1,78

												RO2 (along with the Rising Storm expansion) is one of the most brutal first person shooters available.  This is one of the few shooters I have in my library that does not feel like an arcade experience.  Here are the following reasons I keep coming back to this game: suppressing fire and artillery cause your character to panic, affecting your aim and movement.  There are not countless weapons and upgrades to choose from; weapons are limited to squad availability, which forces teams to work together unlike other modern shooters.  You are easily killed, which forces you to move and attack carefully.  Finally, and most importantly, this game is hard...VERY hard.  It takes a while to get used to the play style and to properly explore the importance of the different squad roles.  This is one of those games where the first time you play it you will get killed very quickly and very often, not because there's some level 99 player with all of the weapons and upgrades unlocked kicking everyone's♥♥♥♥♥ but because you haven't learned how to properly play the game.  This game is gritty, brutal, realistic, maddening, and a hell of a good time.			",93,4,1,6,6,0,24

												Artillery rains down on the streets as a small group of Russians hold an apartment block. ""HOLD THE POINT!"" Our commander yells in chat as we continue to fight a losing battle, hoping to at least dwindle their numbers so they can't push through to other towns. I'm here with my bolt action, taking ineffective shots at the growing number of Axis soldiers moving into the point. My character curses his gun as he hides in cover to reload.A teammate walks past me as I'm reloading, gun down, holding his stomach, and my character starts fumbling the magazine as I see him bleed to death. I peek from cover and take out a soldier. ""I'll never get these faces out of my head"" is my character's last spoken words before the Axis take their victory. You are infeebled as a player, and forced to rethink your strategy. As a rifleman, you're stuck on the back lines, firing at what you hope is not your own teammembers, trying to capture points with your horrible firearms. It's the only military shooter I've seen that features a sanity meter as it should, making the battle more intense and the characters more human. For the first hour, I never even saw an enemy, so be prepared to study your teams and discern green brown from brown green. This game does its job in creating desperation, and requires real courage to try to conquer this depressing shooter.			",225,39,1,29,12,0,26

												I was sitting alone in a house overlooking a train yard with my PPsh clutched in my hands. I heard MP40 shots go off behind me and a comrade scream in agony. I waited patiently in the house until I saw the bratwurst eating culprit whiz past the frame of the door I was covering, and watched him take position overlooking the train station. I siezed my chance, came up behind him and put about 4 or 5 rounds in him. Thing is, I didn't kill him though. He lay on the ground and let out a blood curling scream of absolute terror and suffering as he slowly bled to death on the dirt. There was no time to survey his wounds though, as immediately, 2 foot soldiers overheard the commotion and advanced on me from 12 oclock. Getting into a prone position right next to the bleeding, writhing enemy I had just shot, I quickly dispatched the two with a couple more short bursts of gunfire as his deafening last screams pounded at my right eardrum.TL;DR: ♥♥♥♥ed up a German, laid in his blood next to him, popped two more of his buddies as he quite loudly let me know what horrible pain I had inflicted upon him.Some of the best voice acting I've ever come across in a game. Never playing COD again!			",41,2,3,0,8,0,0

												I've had this game for over a year now, but was never able to really play it until now (I had horrible framerate issues back then).It's a realistic World War II FPS game. -Weapons never stay centered on the screen-You die in 1 to 2 hits (or you bleed out from non fatal injuries)-Magazines are actually preserved (you don't regain unspent bullets from a changed mag; instead, the partially used mag is saved for later)-There is no ammo counter. You check the number of bullets by feeling the weight of the magazine, or by pulling back the bolt of a rifle to count the bullets inside (done by holding the reload button). Even then, you won't know the exact number. It'll tell you if it's empty/near-empty/half-full/more than half/full.-Suppression is a thing. If there's too much gunfire around you, your screen will turn black and white. Your character will start shaking, and you can't steady your aim down your iron sights.-Bullet drop is a thing. When aiming down your sights, you can compensate for bullet drop by adjusting your view down the iron sights (done by scrolling up/down with the mouse scroll). The further a target, the more you'll have to lower your sights to get an accurate shot.-There's a cover system. I don't use it much, but it's still there. You can also lean left/right.-Roles are limited so as to prevent the Battlefield problem. Depending on the number of players, there can only be 1-2 snipers, 1-4 machinegunners, 1-2 elite assaults, 1-5 squad leaders, etc. -There is a commander role. The commander is responsible for calling in aerial recon (to reveal enemy locations), force respawning (to support a large push against a capture point), and various types of artillery. Artillery coordinates must be requested from squad leaders, which further illustrates the team aspect of this game.			",94,9,1,6,10,0,17

												This game is hands down my favorite FPS game of all time. Granted customization isnt entirely great you have a few different weapons for each class and unlock the weapons for the other factions as you level each class (as well as stat improvement and attachments) but outside of that there is'nt anything. The combat and graphics make up for that by leaps and bounds.    The combat is very immersive and gets your blood pumping in intense situations. Storming a house/trench system, trying to defend and keep enemies out from your position, heart pumping close quarters combat not knowing who is around the corner or in the next room, the statisfaction you get when you pick some one off from over 100 meters away, how effective teamwork is and the impact it will make on how a round goes while trying to secure objectives or coordinate atry strikes.    Now the game can get very annoying and frustrating when your team is utter crap (like in every other game) since you can get locked down in the same spot and not be able to move or get any where without dying or your enemy just steam rolls through objectives. It is also a little difficult to tell the teams apart sometime but if you know the uniforms of the different nations its not bad. If you're new probably going to team kill often and really♥♥♥♥♥♥people off but its a learning curve.    The community is normally very helpful but also can be a little bit of eliteist sometimes. Its real easy to become a die hard fan of this game once you start getting decent and familarized with the game. So dont let some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s scare you off for TKing or not going for the right objective. TL;DR+great immersive combat/gameplay and graphics+a lot of realism and historicly accurate weapons/battles+huge battles and maps as well as small ones+chain of command from commanders to squad leaders with differing perks-very frustrating at first vs vet players-possible elitists getting angry at you for being new-low customization			",53,6,0,12,6,0,9

												The most hardcore of hardcore shooters. Steep learning curve. If you have the patience to stomach these particulars, you will definitely enjoy yourself immensely, once you are through with the first part of your learning phase, where you will die. And die. And... D-I-E.Up to 64 players per map, including a commander and squad leaders. Squads are made up of set numbers of each class, and are large, up to... I think 10 players a squad, counting the squad leader? The graphics are good, the sound is OK and the gameplay is where this ultra-realistic shooter shines. Where ArmA is a military simulation, this is a realistic shooter GAME.This is a very team-oriented game, the antithesis of COD and its rambo-style, 1-man-army gameplay.  Highly recommended, especially with the Rising Storm expansion, 8.5/10.			",347,93,23,81,42,1,104

												Rising Storm is simply THE best FPS i've ever played, the most realistic WW2 game ever released. The gameplay is pretty difficult in the beginning since it's extremely realistic, what that means is that it's not like COD or BF, it's very different type of FPS, it's simply realistic. Games take alot of time to end, sometimes an 30 mins sometimes an hour but are extemly fun and never boring, graphics are GREAT, weapons are amazing, sounds are perfect and the music is simply breath taking, personally i found no cons what so ever 10/10 worth every penny, give it a try and you wont be disapointed :)And remember, the key to win is teamplay !

												Has a distinctive, unpolished tripwire feel.  I can understand how some people would enjoy its ultra-realism in exchange for fun, but I'll stick with the Battlefields and Call of Duties.  During gameplay, it falls down to luck or knowledge of the maps most of the time...meaning that you have to spend a lot of time on the game in order to be good...not something that you can just log onto and enjoy.

												This is probably the best multiplayer shooter up to date. The game is semi-realistic, which means it tries to be both realistic and fast at the same time. A single bullet means death if it hits head, heart or lungs (in case of lungs it's not an immediate death though as you can still shoot while dying), but a bullet to less vital parts of a body will only cause a wound. A bullet shot into enemy's weapon will effectively disarm him. Granades are very deadly as they should be, which is important to mention, because in many games their effectiveness is downplayed. Wounded legs will slow you down, wounded arms will negatively affect your accuracy. The game is very fast as there are ""tickets"" that let players respawn until they run out, hence there usually isn't too much turtling and the game heavily discourages such tactics anyway due to maps, use of artillery and so on. Many maps allow multiple tactics as they usually allow two (sometimes even more) points to attack for a team, hence the defenders need to spread out, and attackers can decide where to focus on pushing the enemy forces. The game provides multiple classes to choose from, but the better and more important ones are limited, and interestingly not every player is equal - some get better weapons, some get worse, but also some are leaders, while others are cannon fodder. But it is fun regardless of what class you are playing (although you might have your favourite one). The game isn't about being the best in the team, it's about helping the team. It is very encouraged by the game's mechanics and affects the game in a very significant way, hence why the game doesn't play like another random multiplayer shooter #241221. It's unique in its own way. I definitely recommend it to everyone who enjoy multiplayer action games, regardless if they prefer realism or arcade, as this game is somewhere in-between (albeit inclines more towards realism than arcade). The only negative things I can say about this game is that albeit its realism, bullets do not penetrate objects (which is a serious flaw), and the fact that unlike previous games by Tripwire RO2 doesn't support anything besides Windows operating system.

												This game makes you feel rather like an insignificant infantryman. You run around, a shot cracks in the distance, and you fall over dead, often not even knowing where the shot came from.Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm are terrifyingly realistic. Players must account for bullet drop and taking cover is a must. Playing this game ""CoD style"", or running around the map shooting things, is a surefire way to kill yourself.The cover system is well implemented. Once in cover, a player can peek and fire, then duck back into hiding. Staying exposed for an extended period of time will draw the attention of a sniper you will be picked off from a distance. However, even when behind cover, there is always the fear of a stray grenade bouncing over to your location, or an artillery strike raining down over your position. You are almost never safe.The sound design in particular is superb, completely immersing you into the WWII battlefield. The crackle of gunshots, the screeching of artillery, your screaming comrades, and the shock of explosions all contribute to a pretty frightening war game.The game also has a relatively small but active multiplayer community. There are always some servers that have a few people. The rest of the spots are populated by bots. These AI are relatively decent. They do know to take cover and can usually shoot to some degree of accuracy.Gameplay itself is usually objective-based, encouraging players to play for their team rather than themselves. Killing enemies from or in an objective will earn a player more points, further discouraging people from playing ""CoD style"" and putting emphasis on teamwork.Overall, this game is not for the faint of heart, but people wanting a break from annually-photocopied generic FPS games will appreciate Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm.Rating: PTSD/10			",41,1,2,1,4,1,2

												The best WWII shooter on the market, which is able to find a sweet balance between military simulations and arcade shooters. From the frozen battlefields of the eastern Front to the tropical vistas of the Pacific, RS/RO creates an immersive environment where every step and every shot are important. With a serious emphasis on teamwork, this shooter requires people to think before they act. This is no ""lone wolf"" type game. You may start feeling like a child who's lost its mother, but with time and experience, you may get to be an efficient killing machine. The only downside in this game must be the painful grinding for weapons. Though they are not dramatic COD like unlocks, they are quite difficult to get. The satisfying feeling of landing a head shot with a bolt action rifle on  a moving target 90 meters away will fuel many into losing themselves for hours in this game.  ",87,5,0,5,18,0,33

												A tactical fun FPS that punishes unpatient and mindless gameplay hard. Make sure you have VOIP enabled,  as most team leaders will use it to command their team, I previously had it turned off and ran around like a headless chicken making the game boring pretty fast, once I turned on VOIP I instantly began to have fun and developed an understanding for the game. If you like tactical games that require you to use your head, and enjoy realistic FPS games this is the game for you.			",219,24,11,23,20,0,15

												Guys, this game is just amazig and awesome! U play either a german or a russian soldier in WW2. There are 3 gamemodes: 1st territory where the attackin team has to capture all of the enemys capzones; 2nd countdown where u have to capture more capzones during a given time then the enemy or 3rd firefight where you have to kill as many enemys as possible.If u are a fan of CoD or CS u probable wont like the game cuz its a bit slower and the grafic isnt so amazing as in other games. The realy good thing of the game is the atmosphere: the soldiers speak in their mothertongue, scream for help if their under fire or comment the battle. The second in my eyes good thing is the realism. here ur very often dead after one shot and if not ur health doesnt regenerate instead u have to dress ur wound before u bleed to death. the weapons are realistic too: the recoil is bigger as in other games and u have to aim carefully. hipfire should be only used when ur skilled enaugh. U also can upgrad weapons and soldierclasses (like rifleman or engineer) to get awards like bayonet for some weapons or more or bigger mags. there is a level system too wich goes from 10 to 99. After reaching 80 u can play the classes u skilled enaugh as a hero wich brings a lot of advantages (like resisting barrages longer (ur sight becomes grey if ure under barrages for longer then a few moments)). the maps are mostly very big but there are some small ones too if u like that more. if u should have played liked RO1 too u should love this game too (but I heard that a few RO1 fans dont like that game). its more dynamic and much faster. the last thing i want to tell u guys is that there is the addon Rising Storm wich plays in the Pacific theatre (USA against Japan) and brings new weapons and new features (Flamethrower/Banzaicharge) to the game. Another addon (""In Country:Vietnam"") will be released in 2014. the only thing i dont like at the game are the bots. they re cannon fodder for disttances above 50 m (and waste reinforcements like this), quickscope u witch the second shot on under 50 m and are very dangerous in melee o.O All in all it just a great game and if u just have a bit of money ull have allot of multiplayer fun witch a lot of adrenalinkicks :D If u have any questions towards the game just messge me :Dhope u buy it all and cya in the game :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game, my top shooter for over 2 years now (look at my hours played - it says enough). This game has everything from COD-small sized maps with intense papasha slaughter (apartments) to maps featuring more ""line"" combat (pavlovs house, mamayev, winterwald) where the teams battle for those several meters, losing hundreds of soldiers just to get shelled by the enemy arty & have your point lost again by the defending forces, making you feel (atleast a tiny bit) how dreadfull, disgusting and annoying trench warfare/line warfare can be (hint: FLANKING). It even goes so far to very open & large maps such as mamayev kurgan, bridges of druzhina (if u don't keep your head down, you'll lose you head trust me) or barashka.Basically, for this price & if you're looking for a more realistic shooter where i've seen amazing pistol-aimed killshots from over 100 meter (which is pretty damn hard to get) to getting shot by pretty much any weapon means death, no ""healthbar"", i'd say buy this & buy the digital deluxe. It's only still 18 euro's/dollars (cheap compared to the next puked out COD for 60 + DLC - btw this game has FREE DLC) and you'll get the amazing AVT-40 & MkB42(z) (which is basically the prototype for the mp44) which give you quite the punch for your buck.10/10 by far, they really need to make maps as big as they got on battlefield with this game! (preferably with player controlled aircraft & MORE tanks, infantry vehicles etc...) then i'd just nerdgasm.PS: it also features class-based & squad-based gameplay with MG teams, snipers, assault teams, common rifleman, squad leaders and the team leader aswell in some cases a driveable tank (which has a hughe realistic feel to it hence u either pop your head out the tank making sweet shots for MG teams or snipers, or you look through the tiny peepholes in your tank, where a good AT soldier can shoot you through the peep hole or blow your tank up shooting at it's ammo racks under the top track a little bit to the left - resulting in a nice BANG ""look at this ivan, it's christmas fireworks!

												Amazing game! Definitely blows COD and Battlefield out of the water! Good graphics, great gameplay, and a great sense of realism and teamwork is deffinitely required to accomplish anything, unlike most games these days. Add Rising Storm to the mix and BOOM you have the best WW2 FPS everymade! I just have one thing to say: Rifle grenades. I think they would be extremely handy and give the standard infantry a better chance against tanks. The could be an unlock for Elite Riflemen, or as and American counter to the Japanese knee-mortars in Rising Storm! Anyway, great game and by far one of my favorites!			",53,2,0,4,14,0,22

Being able to charge over trenches with bayonets fixed, you don't know when you will be targeted! The machine gunner class is by far the most tense class.

I reccomend the gamemodes: Realism and Campaign to be played together for the best experience of this game.Amazing Graphics, gunplay is smooth and realistic (guns also look top notch), characters are well textured.Set in the front line of Stalingrad this game opens a whole new world to realism players having the bold action of battlefield and the tactical realism of ArmA its a must buy game, very enjoyable with friends but also brilliant without. Most servers are good and you should probably add the best to your favourites, in the best servers players communicate and squad/team leaders work well together.Graphics: 8/10Realism: 9.5/10Gunplay: 10/10Emmersion: 10/10Overall Game: 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												史上最强二战模拟游戏的续作。虽说向游戏性做出了妥协，但在许多方面还是有不小的进步的。武器模型更真实、配件更丰富，可损毁的建筑，小队指挥系统，动态提示系统，武器的多种状态切换等。另外全新成长系统，给了玩家长久玩下去的目标。现在BUG已经很少了，这么多年了，还在持续增加新地图、新模式也真不容易啊。在线战役的大坑居然也给填上了。我见过最良心的开发组。			",1168,391,88,210,245,11,294

												While being on Soviet side, I see my comrade getting shot next to me. I hold tightly my rifle while hearing german words being yelled around me and ammo is getting low. German officer shows up from stairs and I yell ""Friendly! Friendly! I love Germany!"" and then being shot on back. I absolutely love this game. Fights can be tense sometimes and holding line is furious to last man. Building fights have caused several heartattacks on me because never can know who comes behind corner. You need to be patience tho, this is not rush and run game where you can absorb tens of bullets. One shot and you are dead. Community is quite nice, alive and decent, only met few trolls during game play. Tutorial was clumsy tho and I learned most of things by just going into fight. People are always helping new ones so dare to ask. If you love FPS and WW2, this is totally game for you. My only complain on this game is that it love to crash often. :(			",39,28,0,4,6,0,1

												When looking at games that are not as endorsed as most mainstream FPS games (Bioshock, Call of Duty, and Battlefield), this game falls short of mechanics.  The mechanics of this game are not bad, but campared to the smoothness of the mainstream games they are a little bit on the weak side. This is not a reason to not buy this game though because where the mechanics fall short, the gameplay and community are a lot better. This game takes a lot more skill than running around and shooting people. There are tactics involved in playing this online. After killing an enemy in this game, you feel like you've accomplished something campared to going 30-4 in Call of Duty. Now I am not a huge FPS person, but I do highly recommend this game.

												This game is very frustrating at the beginning. Is just pretty different from the other fps shooters with heavy multiplayer gameplay. Like Battlefield game or specially Call of Duty franchise. Why? Well this game is Hardcore.But like REAL HARDCORE.Your character even ♥♥♥♥♥ himself in the pants in the middle of the battlefield. So you die a lot. A LOT.But I kept trying man, I still tried and tried over and over... and once you understand the game guys, it gets super fun.Its very tactical and the community is very strong, players try to help, they talk to each other, they work together. If you like hard games, tactical games, realistic games, well this is your game then.I recommend it, its pretty different from all the other fps shooters I've played before and I found it to be really entertaining!

												THIS GAME IS:10% luck20% SKILL15% CONCENTRATED POWER OF WILL5% PLEASURE50% PAINAND 100% REASON TO PURCHASE THE GAME.*Shamelessly ripped from another review.Anyways, this game is more than 20% skill, and certainly more than 20% luck. It is a simulator, not a game, in the same vein as ARMA II. Varying bullet velocities, ballistic drops, lack of a HUD must be taken into account at all times. Further, floating names over allies are rare, meaning that every shot could result in teamkill if the target itself isn't verified. Each game is a battle of impulse and reflex as any FPS, but also of tactics and strategy, and most importantly of teamwork and situational awareness. Every corner is meticulously checked, every seemingly empty field is avoided or scoured, every street is treated as a funnel. Think fast, act fast, or die fast. It IS that simple.			",41,1,0,7,0,0,2

												A breddy gud WWII shooter with a lot of good ideas but it's held back by some major flaws.Red Orchestra is as authentic as a multiplayer WWII shooter can get, if you can ignore the constant nazi-bolshievek arguments that keep appearing in the chatbox. In any server with more than 20 people you're going to pick up the rifleman role or any of the lesser roles, gamechanging roles like marksman, commander and machine gunner are few in numbers and the entire game can hinge on how well those players can make use of their roles. Everyone else is just cannon fodder, you go out, try pick off as many as you can but you're going to end up getting shot from someone you can't see. It sounds infuriating but it's really fun. The large numbers of soldiers, the wide open maps, the look of the game, the way it plays all lend to the immersion. When you're hold up on the second floor of a bombed-out building with artillery dropping around you while you put a few rounds into the gut of a German who entered downstairs and you hear him scream for a full 15 seconds that's when you know you're having fun.This game has some really obvious problems and they do ruin the fun. The main one being that this game just isn't fluid at all, movement is clunky and often unreliable, simple inputs like switching weapons often requires multiple attempts if you're doing anything else at the same time, it's so easy to interrupt reloads unintentionally without even realising. It doesn't feel fair if I die because I ran out of ammo and switching to my secondary took me a full ten seconds to do because moving slightly to the left is apparently too much for the game to handle. Some maps have some serious balancing issues too, although I know it was probably difficult to find a good spot between realistic and fair but it's frustrating when the 10 servers with more than 10 players are all playing the same 3 maps with those issues. The game also doesn't explain a lot, I still have no clue what value there is in levelling up weapons, I still don't know why I'm given the option to bandage an injury only to find out I've wasted 15 seconds because it was pointless and I had to watch my screen just slowly fade to black, I still don't know how to complete certain objectives and I still don't understand certain leader functions. It's one thing for a game to not hold your hand, it's another for a game to just not explain basic things.Either way it's pretty fun and is usually cheap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was around noon. I was running towards the bridge with a comrade. Suddenly, we heard a yelling, and a german tank with a machine gun has started shooting at us. My comrade's body was painted fully red by his blood, and he fell down. I had no time to think. I had to continue running towards the water. That was my last chance. As a bullet hit my leg, I jumped into the muddy swamp. I had finally survived, I thought.. I crawled under the bridge, and started bandaging my leg.. I had a few minutes to rest, but I had to continue. I saw a little island with some bushes. Perfect place to launch a surprise attack. As I have approached the bushes, I saw two small holes, dug for probably the same reasons I wanted to use it for. I climbed down, put down my bandages, my ammo, and started scouting the bridge. I saw two panzers move through, and approaching my comrades. I have also saw two snipers and one machinegunner moving under the bridge. I quickly loaded my Mosin Nagant, and aimed. I thought about the chance of escaping: No, that would be appropriate for the traitors. I will never leave my comrades behind.So I took an aim and shot them. They fell one-by-one. One shot, one kill, they say. And nobody has noticed me. I sat there for a few minutes. Thinking about the chances of a surprise attack. As my comrades were rushing towards the bridge, I took my rifle and loaded it with my last magazine. I took an aim for the sniper on the german end of the bridge: His helmet flew away, and he fell off the bridge.My comrades were able to finally pass the panzers, and occupy the bridge. However, I was sure I couldn't survive for too long. Suddenly, voice of an engine started becoming louder and louder. It was surely in my vicinity. As I stood up, I saw a panzer, coming right for me. People say that the death is quick. It took approximately 0,5 seconds for the tank to crush my whole body. But, in the end, I was happy that I was able to help my team to reach victory. After all, that is what matters, right?And, guys, imagine: That was just a 10-minute-slice from a multiplayer match. Amazing game, 10/10.			",174,19,10,23,24,2,22

												This game is really nice. Its a realistic game of the second world war. All maps are real theaters of war. Seriously if u want to run and shoot (like CoD etc.) this isn't the right game for you.For beginners it may look quite a hard game but when you play it a while you will learn how to play it. You  need to play with your team, you need tactics and u have to hide behind walls and other stuff. Otherwise you are an easy snack to the enemies.Also a nice thing is, that the developers still working on new content and keeping this title updated.Conclusion: Its a nice game with a big and active community. If u like realistic wargames this will be your game! And u will love it! So buy and play it :)			",386,105,14,45,46,2,65

												A World War 2 era combat simulator, RO2 entails eastern front battles between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Highly realistic gameplay mechanics leave no room for silliness on the battlefield! While the single played is a time waster, multiplayer is where the heart of the game is.Rising Storm is a reskinned addon which includes new maps and weapons based on the pacific battles between Imperial Japan and (Imperial) US. Each RO2 buyer can play on RS maps but can only play as a rifleman.It is worthy to mention that this game has been updated countless times with new weapons and maps - all of which were free.The price of this game alone is enough to justify a purchase.

												The best shooter known to manThis game is unforgiving, brutal, complicated and gives you no ♥♥♥♥ing quarter at all. However its also intense af and the lads from Tripwire put a lot of detail into everything. You drop dead the second an enemy looks at you. The guns feel great and anything that fires more than 1 bullet per minute is very hard to control. The command and class system is great. With the commander really being important and not just a cheap excuse to harvest kills with artillery strikes. Maps are well designed although sadly only a small percentage is actually played. Sound design is exceptional too everyone screams 24/7 either because your♥♥♥♥♥got torched by a flamer or youre giving orders. The community is great. If you thought  youve seen everything fire this game up and enjoy the voicechat. Its either a) 20 people talking about how uncle Adolf could have won the war or b) someone playing the national anthem of the Soviet Union performerd by the choir of the Red Army and 20 people singing along. With option 2 only taking place if youre currently defending the soil of RODINA from the grasp of some fashist svoloch. A very underrated game really. Pick it up.			",66,4,1,4,2,1,24

												This is one of the Games that you will Never regret spending your money on. I have played ( to date ) countless FPS games, this one never gets old. Its always challenging and fun. I usually play campaign mode with a bunch of other players - Fighting for Stalingrad over different maps and territories.  ( it never gets old ).I would like to add, that in my opnion, if i were told to make one of the best multiplayers games ever made, i would throw this in the list, simply - because the gameplay is lots of fun. It can be difficult for beginners, but once you develop your "" eagle eye "" for your surroundings, you may very well end up on the highest scoring list.  Buy the game, you will not regret it. :)			",65,3,0,6,10,0,12

												More arcade than RO1, but also more fun in many ways. It's not perfect. But it's definitely enjoyable. Using a flamethrower or going banzai on the japanese side are just some of the excellent additions brought by Rising Storm. Making the game a lot more worthwhile.			",103,18,0,18,18,0,36

												This game can be pretty intimidating at first and you'll probably die a lot before you even see enemy soldiers. It's really based more on knowledge than raw skill. You don't need to have good twitch reflexes (though they can help) to be a good player. You need to know how the maps work, where your team needs you most, when to move, and how to not die. Generally one side attacks and one side defends. It is crucial to coordinate with your team, especially while attacking. There definitely seems to be a strong correlation between how many knowledgeable guys on your team are using microphones and how often your team wins. If somebody says ""Everybody needs to bonzai charge the cap zone NOW!"" you'll be surprised how quickly 20 or so Japanese soldiers are screaming into the smoke straight into the cap. You don't need to use a mic yourself, but you'd be wise to listen at least some of the time to your teammates advice (don't worry about the crazy guy that is screaming nonsense at his computer).Overall it's a very fun game but has it's problems. Single player is pretty much non-existent if you care about that, the movement feels a little clunky and can be awkward when a player interacts with the level geometry. They unnecessarily split up the game into ""action"" and ""realism"" modes when it's obvious this game caters to the realism audience. It lacks some polish, but it's not a $60 huge budget game so that's to be expected. There could be more maps and more vehicles, especially the latter which have been neglected since the first RO.All in all, a good game at a good price.			",185,20,6,16,16,2,16

												Tired of having to buy extra DLC just to feel like you are getting the full expeience? Or perhaps you are tired of the enemy soaking up bullets and never actually dying.Either way this game overcomes such issues and goes beyond anyother FPS game I have seen before. The stunning attention to detail in the animations and models is a joy to see and the maps feel realistic. There is also a fear present in this game, something that most other games lack, a knowledge that you could be shot from out of nowhere or that you could have been flanked without seeing it.On top of all of that the community is fantastic and there will always be people trying to commuincate in game. So would I recommend this game?Yes whole heartedly, it is always enjoyable.			",68,12,0,5,6,0,28

												Personally i find Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 as the sweet spot between simulation/realism and action game.I cant think of any other WWII game that came recently to replace RO2, it is the best WWII FPS out there and its a great game in its own category. Gameplay is very brutal for new comers, it has realistic gameplay and RO2 also has bullet drop which is a very nice feature!RO2 is a huge game and it has a very hard learning curve, thats why many people buy it on sale then abandon when they die zillion of times without shooting down a couple of enemies...In RO2 you see people crawl, sneak, hide, run, cry, taunt, swear, and explode just in front of your eyes.All the chaos, artillaries and explosions makes you feel like youre really in the battlefield, not to mention the fear of facing a tank especially when the turret turns to your direction, I just ♥♥♥♥ my pants when that happens and pray the gunner didnt notice me!Yeah I love RO2 because its a badass game. Recommended to people who love WWII Shooters and realistic hard game.			",317,36,29,24,23,2,41

												This is my favourite fps, very realistic, yet not on the expance of fun. You can play against bots to learn maps,get use to weapons and develope skills, and then jump to the real thing with human players. Atmosphere is great, sound is excelent make you feel as if you are realy there. In my opinion, every player who is looking for acombination of a realistic combat simulation which can still deliver pure fun - this is the right title! 9.5/10 on my personal scale.

Posted: October 17, 2016
												I bought Rising Storm--a separate entity and was introduced to the Red Orchestra series through Rising Storm. From my experience, it's very difficult for new players to get acclimated to how this game feels because the only servers available now are Realism servers where everything is mostly one-shot kills and it's very difficul to tell where you're being shot from. Probably one of the most annoying aspects of the game is the feeling of hopelessness as you stare around, not really knowing where you need to aim and then you just get picked off. Most of the time, I spent hiding behind a wall, in bushes, and in unconventional places in order to just not get picked off. It's very frustrating when you have to wait 10-15 (sometimes even longer) seconds to respawn and as you're running into the objective, you get picked off.As in many competitive multiplayer games, the community is what makes or breaks it and this game has one of the most toxic playerbases I've ever encountered. No, not everyone I've come across was toxic but it's very demoralising when you see ""None of you f---s are playing the objective!"" every single time your team loses a round of Territory. New players are turned off by clunky the movement is, frustrated by flamethrowers, and upset when they voice their opinion and are immediately shot down by the veteran players for being noobs. The community is driving away the new players and is slowly dying in the process as the game ages.Because new players are being driven away, there's only a handful of servers with a big enough population to actually play on while the rest are empty or are filled with bots. These handful of servers are all in Realism mode and all of them are Territory. There's no variety, no different game types, and only a handful of classes to choose from each of which have two primaries to choose from. Despite all these negative things about the game, not everything was entirely bad. Realism mode is a double-edged sword because even though you are easily killed, so are your enemies. There's something extremely satisfying about firing a bolt-action rifle and seeing your opponents just drop immediately. The game's sound is top-notch and comparable to that of Battlefield 1. Every gun sounds meaty. The sound of a headshot is awesome. Racking your gun sounds real. I can't say enough about how good this game really sounds.Even though all you can play is Territory, it really isn't a bad game mode. I like that it's unique compared to many of the other FPS game types out there and it does a decent job of simulating realism in how reinforcements and supplies work. The two teams will get a limited number of supply points that slowly trickle down each round you play as your team takes casualties and the game ends when one side loses all of their supply points. When you're in the game, you will get spawned in waves in order to simulate reinforcements, which adds a tactical element to the game because your Team Leader (TL) can force a respawn wave in order to hopefully stop the advancing enemy enemy or to overwhelm a defending team. There is no other game out there where it's as satisfying when successfully playing the objective but that's probably because it's so damn hard to actually play the objective. No other game has managed to keep me so stressed out as I play because I'm so worried about getting shot from any direction.Although  I had fun playing this game sometimes, my final verdict for this game is -NOT RECOMMENDED for players new to the Red Orchestra franchise- mainly due to the clunky movement, dying playerbase, and high learning curve that discourages new players.

												This game is incredible. I haven't enjoyed playing a game this much in a long time. You can play as a Commander class which can call in recon planes, mortor bombardment, arty etc. You can be a squad leader which allows your squad to spawn on you and you can mark areas of the map for the commander to call in a bombardment. Or you can be a soldier, choose your ""class"", rifleman, assault, sniper, machine gunner etc. There are a good amount of weapons, the maps are large but easy to learn and they are open enough to using flanking tactics. Rising Storm as amazing. Here is just one tiny part on one map during one match that took place:I was playing as the Allies and we were fighting fiercly to take an enemy position that was heavily fortified. As we approached our Squad Leader marked the position and told the Team Leader over comms it was marked. The Team Leader confirmed, calling in a recon plane and dropped arty. Everyone took cover as we watched explosions landing just ahead. Round after round hit, dirt flying up in the air. Our next wave of reinforcements had arrived and were crossing the river to meet us on the far bank closest to the enemy. All of a sudden we hear ""Arty has been cancelled, push forward"" and with that everyone got off their bellies and charged into the trenches, bayonets ready, itchy triggy fingers awaiting the huge onslaught, expecting heavy losses.. and.. and... nothing. There were no enemies. None. Where were they? We quickly moved throughout the fortified position, taking positions facing outwards for any glimpse of our opponent. After taking a nice spot behind some sandbags that were stacked up with a good view hole to see into the jungle, I took a knee thinking what they could be planning.I hear movement in the jungle, then I hear screaming.. ""Booonzaiiiii"" I take aim and start firing. There are so many, rifles pointed our way, bayonets fixed and they are charging right at us screaming. I pop off a few rounds and take down two of them when I see an officer with a sword leading the charge. I Line up my rifle to take him out, and I die. They had surrounded us and a few of them broke through on my right flank, rushing through the trenches swords swinging and bayonets stabbing everything in their way.I respawned and the battle continued. With moments like this happening all the time, I don't know how this game isn't more widely talked about. Incredible experience that everyone should try.			",757,328,20,70,107,9,180

The combination of (well done, as it doesnt destroy the fun) realism and rewarding tactical team play place it among the best tactical FPS out there. Its worth a go, if you've got the dough. If you see it on sale, dont pass it up.ProTip: If youre a noob, you will die, it happens. I was a noob once too, and i died, a lot. You will get much better once you gain experience, and learn map layouts, as well as the roles of the different classes. Good luck, Have fun!			",57,5,0,13,15,0,35

												It's my understanding that this is the review for this game (That may be utter rubbish but I saw no other reviews!) so let's make it a good one, 'eh?I absolutely love this game. As a fan of war games, FPSs, history, military and general gaming this game is sublime. It truly conveys the horrors of war to the player, which is something most FPSs avoid in order to make their games more action-packed than strategic and atmospheric. There really aren't many games which would make you want to sit in your little foxhole for a bit longer in fear of getting up and being torn apart by machine-gun fire. This is made even more amazing with the fantastic cover system, where you can cover behind almost anything effectively. 9/10 - A fantastic and sometimes terrifying war experience with amazing combat and atmosphere.

												It's a pretty well rounded game, It provides all your WW2 Infantry/Motorized combat. It gets extremely fast paced and insane at times and has a wonderful community. I love this game and plan on playing it much more (as I rediscovered my love for this game). It's also contains some realism componets that aren't to realistic but aren't to arcade like, which is a plus because it adds to the immersion. Like watching your enemies blow into millions of pieces and your machine gun barrel over-heating? Buy this game.9/10			",33,2,0,3,7,0,4

												It would be fair to say the Red Orchestra player is a niche market, however the gritty and often grimm action of the first game is faithfully enhanced; both gameplay and graphics have been improved and although the unreal engine looks good enough it may be enough to deter the pretty boy gamer. This is a shame as this game offers one of the most authentic WW2 shooter experiences ever concieved! Both tense infantry battles and epic tank engagements feature heavilly in Red Orchestra 2, on the ground the horror of war is unleashed with good visuals, sounds and plausible environments. And in the tank the player feels claustrophobic, trapped and confined although possesing some serious firepower the tank crew must work as a team to be effective. All in all an ultra realistic take on WW2 from both the Soviet and Axis perspectives, a must for 3rd person shooter multiplayer nuts...			",160,6,2,17,23,1,55

												Ill start this review by saying that Ive played a great deal of WWII games in my time, including franchises such as Medal of Honor, Brothers in Arms, Call of Duty, Day of Defeat, and many other small companies many people probably haven't heard of. After all of this times spent on WWII gaming (as it is a historical interest of mine as well) I had lost a bit of my interest. Red Orchestra, however, reinvigorated my passions by delivering a realistic and unique shooter. Although the single player campaign is fun to play, most gamers will find the most fun in the multiplayer. The game blends class-based skills and teamwork on detailed maps that will bring you as close as you would want to be to the Eastern Front. Sometimes you will experience weapon jams, suppressing fire, fatigue, and non-lethal wounds that you cannot simply walk away from. For example, if you are hit in the leg while sprinting from cover, you will slow down or even stop, simulating something that most franchises cannot. I will end the review with some simple advice: If you are looking for another Call of Duty, don't look here. Play Red Orchestra for the realism and the unique fun that it offers.Its also basically a PTSD simulator			",77,8,0,12,3,0,8

												A perfect game for a tactical gamer. RO2 offers slow paced gameplay and rewards smart positioning, flanking manuvers, and above all teamwork in order to win the game. 90% of the time players will be using a slow firing bolt action rifle and firing at ranges anywhere from 0-200 meters. The action is unrelenting and the game has a gritty realism to it as the soldiers scream and bullets and grenades explode everywhere. RO2 is perfect for anyone searching for a change from COD, Battlefront, or ARMA.			",58,9,1,14,11,0,6

												While I only have a small amount of time put into this game so far, I can say that I am very, very happy with my purchase. RO2/RS has to be one of the most fun games I've played in a very long time.This game can be rage inducing...This game can be unfair at times......but, it never seems that I didn't have a chance to do better.For instance, I was playing as the Russians on a snow map where we had to push uphill to capture 12 german points in a manner similar to Rush from the battlefield series. I popped my head out, and got sniped. If I thought my plan through, I could've made my way to a hill with more trees on it that would provide cover, but I wasn't thinking as smartly as I could have been.Another thing that I like about this game that I find lacking in other games is teamwork. I don't just mean talking to your teammates and maybe executing team strategies (like in CSGO), but an unspoken teamwork. I never used my microphone, and nor did most of the other players that I played with, but we moved as a group, attacked as a group, and died as a group. Whenever someone pushed up, there were other players that instantly assisted in the push, instantly covered those pushing, and, in my case, take a bullet for a teammate (accidently, but still saved someone in a videogame. ARE YOU PROUD OF ME YET MOTHER!?).The only cons I can think of about this game are the learning curve, team-killing (which is apart of the learning curve in some way), and the optimization. This game can be brutally unforgiving. If you are looking for an arcade game that doesn't really take any skill to dominate, go play one of the recent CODs. This game has a damage model that is basically 1 bullet, 1 kill (in most everycase), but if you somehow survive being shot, you have to find cover and use one of the 2 bandages that you spawn in with everytime. Team killing plays into the learning curve because you have to be able to distinguish who is a friend and who is a foe, which can be difficult in some of the maps where both teams have similar clothing. The game also has some fps drops now and then, but that could just be my system, so take that con with a pinch of salt.Overall, I would have to say that if you are looking for an experience in between Battlefield and ArmA (like Insurgency, but a little bit more so), then this is the game that you probably are looking for. If you do get it, I recommend getting the bundle, because then you will be able to play both Red Orchestra 2 (Eastern Front | Germans and Russians) and Rising Storm (Pacific Campaign | American and Japanese) within the same game. This game is a must have for any FPS player, but take what I said (or typed) with a pinch of salt considering I have just under 3 hours played. I do not believe that my score will go down, but I have a feeling that as I play, the score may increase a bit. Oh, and this game has the best flamethrower that I've ever seen in a video game.

												Can't say I have ever played a better FPS shooter, or, at least, a shooter that has given me this much appreciation towards it. RO2 is by no means a normal FPS, it is hard, it is intense, and it is realistic. You'll find yourself mercilessly get killed if you are only just jumping in, and it doesn't take too long to realize the game requires you to play smart, calculatively, and, most of all, as a team, to do well. There is no room for those who play twitch ""I shot you first I win"" or lonewofl FPS players in RO2.It's hard for me to actually write a review for RO2 now what I got this far, simply because the game is just simply matching my taste in FPS, and that should actually be what it comes down to if you're trying you decide if you want to buy this game. If you think you'd enjoy a realistic, difficult, and challenging, but a rewarding, fun, and intense game with emphasis on teamplay and strategy, I want to say that you will almost certainly enjoy this game. If none of those sound like the type of game you'd enjoy, and you prefer games like BF3, COD, or CS, this game either isn't for you or will be a rough transition.

												I remember having the anti tank gun and i saw this other soldier across the trenches on mamayev kurgan, he looked at me, aimed at me and *click* no ammo, so i had to take the shot before he went in to cover. His head was blown into oblivion, and i saw another player who i later found out just bought the game,  he stared at the headless corpse ignoring all the bullets. PTSD simulator. I love this game 10/10;			",105,7,0,4,4,0,2

												Another FPS game.....  ....But this one is the most intense and thrilling one!Red Orchestra 2 is giving players the opportunity to experience the close quarters combat and the most open battles of the Second World War.This game includes a great engine which allows you to get some very nice gameplay.RO2 has many maps, snowy fields to soviet building blocks. A great way to expand your experience is to buy Rising Storm with it. It features the Amercans and the Japanese forces who will fight eachother in Asia! This game is realism all the way! Flamethrowers, booby traps, banzai rushes. RO2 + Rising Storm is a good one to pick up.So, do you want to expierence the WW2 in a unique way with great multiplayer? Go pick up this game! Still wondering if it's worth your money? Watch video's on Youtube or read more reviews on the internet to learn the game more.			",100,5,16,4,11,1,8

												Can't say I have ever played a better FPS shooter, or, at least, a shooter that has given me this much appreciation towards it. RO2 is by no means a normal FPS, it is hard, it is intense, and it is realistic. You'll find yourself mercilessly get killed if you are only just jumping in, and it doesn't take too long to realize the game requires you to play smart, calculatively, and, most of all, as a team, to do well. There is no room for those who play twitch ""I shot you first I win"" or lonewofl FPS players in RO2.It's hard for me to actually write a review for RO2 now what I got this far, simply because the game is just simply matching my taste in FPS, and that should actually be what it comes down to if you're trying you decide if you want to buy this game. If you think you'd enjoy a realistic, difficult, and challenging, but a rewarding, fun, and intense game with emphasis on teamplay and strategy, I want to say that you will almost certainly enjoy this game. If none of those sound like the type of game you'd enjoy, and you prefer games like BF3, COD, or CS, this game either isn't for you or will be a rough transition.

												Go into this game completely unprepared like i did.Have no deeper understanding of how combat functions.Learn by doing. Don't look at the controls menu.Play as allies for the first very long time.Get mowed down by superior german players with superior weaponry for the first half of your total playtime with this game.Then git gud and get shot by teammates, whom have failed to git gud and can't tell russian uniforms from german uniforms, or are pretending to be the NKVD and are shooting you for not following the commanders orders. Congratulations, you are now playing red orchestra 2 exactly how the Soviet Union was handling WWII and you will instantly discover this is an awesome game.			",161,12,4,22,5,0,20

												I am really happy to own Red Orchestra 2. Unlike most WW2 era games, it stands out. There is a lot of depth and realism packed into an otherwise standard genre that’s been covered a hundred times before. Smart gameplay choices and a clearly dedicated group of developers have given this game more than meets the eye.Red Orchestra 2 is such a fun multiplayer game. I just want to emphasise that before I continue because I’m constantly thinking about when I can continue playing it again. It’s more than just your standard WW2 shooter that pits two teams against one another and whoever kills the most, wins. Tripwire Interactive have considered other aspects of warfare during the Second World War, to make the game feel genuine, realistic, and most important of all, unique.I’ll start with the basics. The game is built to be realistic and therefore features a minimal hud, no crosshair, different stances, and even a “scare factor” (but I’ll get into that later). As you move around the battlefield, your character pants and bobs and holds their breath before shooting at the enemy. There’s a decent ADS(aim down the sights) system that is effected depending on which stance you are in, standing, crouching, or prone. You have to manually check the amount of bullets in your weapon and manually reload when you’re dry. You can use cover to hide or peak,  and sprint while crouched to give yourself more cover whilst moving. All these basic functions add intensity to FPS multiplayer that is unmatched in all other games I’ve played.  The game has incredibly large maps to further emphasise the realism that you’re on a battlefield and there are many ways to approach the situations in front of you. You actually have to think about things tactically instead of just running in there and hoping for the best. There are good areas to run to, and bad areas to avoid.It’s a very team oriented experience. You get to rush trenches with your friends, you get to defend church towers with them, crawl in the mud with them, and a lot of the time get killed with them. The element of teamwork is key to success so if you have a bad team, you’re going to have a bad game. Depending on which team you choose, you can hear different dialogue between your friends and your own character. If you play on the Russian team, everything the German team says will be in German and vice versa if you’re on the German team. The vocal reactions between your character and your teammates is really a great little addition to the realism. They automatically let you know what’s going or express how they’re feeling about things that happen around them. It all makes for a very visceral experience. So now I will move onto the star of the show, something I like to call the “scare factor”. There’s a little bar above your stamina meter that lets you know how mentally stable your character is. As you get shot at or witness teammates getting killed, this bar will drop, your vision will blur, and your weapon will shake. Even when the artillery comes raining down on you, your characters starts shaking and you feel truly helpless. I love this, it really captures the intensity of war and makes me feel as though I’m right there with him. The graphics are incredible, utilizing an enhanced version of the Unreal 3 engine to make some of the most atmospheric battlefields I’ve ever seen.Red Orchestra 2 is not for everyone. It’s a realistic war experience, not COD. Of course there will be many who won’t like it at all, but I’m not one of them (despite the enjoyment I get from COD). If you’re looking for something different and certainly something to remember, this game is for you :)  ",672,117,7,51,43,6,74

												The most realistic game that i have played so far, everything about the game suits the game. Unlike most first-person-shooters Red Orchestra makes you think carefully about your every move, from staying hidden in cover, choosing the right time to shoot, and making sure your weapon ""can"" shoot, wether it be reloading or changing your MG barrel when overheated. Though it takes getting used to, when you have played a couple of games will start to get the hang of it and find it easier to play.11/10 ",86,20,8,10,7,0,8

												One of THE best games ever. The combat is so much better than most other FPS games I have played. I have been craving a game that allows you to blind fire since I played Killswitch on the PS2 . And this game allows you do just that! you can throw grenades around corners without exposing yourself either. Machineguns overheat and if you continue to fire the barrel warps and you have no choice but to change it. Commanders can use binoculars to spot and call in Recon which flies over head and shows where the enemy is but only on the map and the commander has access to Mortars, Artillery and Rocket Barrage to wreck havok on the battlefield.The suppression system is very well made  shoot some bullets at an enemy and his aim will be too shaken to aim back and then you can deliver the final blow. Now that is realism! The lack of vehicles for a game thats been out this long is the only thing I really hate about this game at this point. I wish they would make more, but I have heard that they are not making more as they are working on a Vietnam game can anyone confirm this as I really wanted to see a Tiger in this new Ro2. The bullet drop works well but there are few maps where you can use anything more than 400m I have only been able to use the Bullet Drop to effect on several maps. I can only really vouch for the Axis as I have only played for the Axis on the Eastern front and Allies for the Pacific Campaign. To the Pros and ConsProsTHIS IS A TEAM GAME - Blind fire System that acutally works.- If you don't use teamwork you will fail!- Tank Battles are awesome.- Leveling system is great.- Mulitple game modes - Working Bullet physics- You can yell Most Dishonorabr in Rising stormand everyone will start yelling similar things and laugh with you USUALLY- You can Nut shot people with bullets. (you can tell when you see a cracked acorn icon for a kill message)Cons-Japanese get a knee mortar that can get really annoying after you get killed multiple times.-Finding servers with ping near you is a MUST if you are to get a kill as you must aim in front of someone to compensate for the high ping if you are to kill anything if you do join a high ping server.-The grind gets really old after a while.-2 types of tanks for each side in the Eastern Front side and a 1 transport. No vehicles in Rising Storm.			",135,2,0,11,13,0,34

												UNBELIEVABLE.Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad is the sequel/expansion spinnoff to the original Red Orchestra.The game is a World War 2 First Person Shooter designed to be multiplayer only, with a singleplayer ""campaign"" against bots.If this sounds boring, it's only because this has been done SOOOO many times before.So what makes this game stand out from the masses? 2 main things:1) The painstakingly historical accuracy2) FUNRed Orchestra, while somewhat obscure, has always been reccognised by those who know about it for it's historicaly accurate portrayal of World War 2. Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm continues this tradition to the (somewhat) extreame.This is no Call of Duty, and this is no Battlefield. The only thing ""Battlefieldly"" in this is the hellhole of chaos that happens on the maps. While it doesn't have the Blockbuster-like fun of World At War, and without the characters and story of Brothers In Arms, Red Orchestra 2 is more of an interesting history discussion than a movie or book. If you are someone who enjoys history discussions, then you will like this a LOT.Red Orchestra 2 is set in 1940-1942 on the Eastern Front, and portrays historical battles in it's multiplayer matches, where you play the grunts and soldiers sent into the meat grinder for the Russian/German war machine.Don't worry: it's not like it's going to be a documentary with someone from the History channel commenting on your every action: it's more of a WW2 Simulator, and not one of the bad ones.Let's get into the meat of what it has to offer: While there is the ""Normal"" style of play, which is very much like Call of Duty, the MAJORITY (94%) of the players are playing on the ""Realism"" mode (The way is was ment to, and should be, played)The game uses a minimalist HUD, with UI only popping up when neccisary. Seeing as this is so close to real life, there is no Health bar: You die in a SINGLE BULLET, to the head, chest, and groin. If hit in the arms and legs; you either use a bandage (which takes time to put on, and can only be done twice) or you bleed out to death as the screen goes dark, and everything goes quiet. The weapons are awesome. In ""Realism"" there is not crosshair, meaning you have to use ironsights, and blind fire is about as effective as harsh language. All weapons have accurate recoil, modeling, sound effects, damage (Rifles kill in 1 shot anywhere, machine guns are similary powerful)and animation. Like how you not only have to reload machineguns; you have to change the barrel if they overheat. Or how you can toggle the Scope or Ironsights on a sniper weapon. Or how you can't ironsight a machinegun unless they are mounted on cover.There are various classes in each team, each with different weapons and ablities, so how many weapons you have depends on your choice. Ultimatley you can carry a maximum of 2 primary weapons, 2 pistols, 2 grenades of 2 types (Smoke or Frag), and (depending on class) binoculars. You can't have every weapon in each class, so you have to find them on dead bodies.The Movemnt is nothing short of amazing: you can sprint forever, but your soldier tires out after a few seconds, so your walking speed is faster then sprinting. You can stand, croutch, go prone, and lean. Your movement depends on your weapon that you are holding, so you don't feel, like in Halfe-Life, that you are a floating orb zooming around everywhere; instead you feel like a human snotling, lugging around a heavy firearm. The game also has a First Person Cover System, where you can latch onto walls. floors, and in trenches. You can blind fire around cover, or use Ironsights to peak out, but it makes you visable and you probably will get shot. Sounds like ARMA, but plays a lot differently.The battlefield is a scary place, full of mines, barbwire, trenches, buildings, and corners for enemies to hide in. Smoke, dirt, and body parts fly up in the air, as a commander calls in an artillery strike from a radio. With this comes problems however, because the environments are ususally the same colour as the players, so it is VERY dificult to tell apart the Grey team from the Slightly Orangey-Brown team. Friendly fire is always on, so you will be seeing frequent use of ""sorry"" in the chats.While the game is realistic, it also means you won't be killing many people. The game wants you to make a last stand against an enemy and preform a heroic sacrifice, like the real heroes of the war, but it doesn't realise that 90% of the time, you will be behind a wall/box/cover, crying for your momy, while you soil your pants.And finally: TANKS. Not the normal tanks: FIRST PERSON TANKS.All the tanks have a first person modeled interior, with the commander, gunner, driver, loader, and radio operator, all cramped inside this steel beast, with interactable pistol-ports, and parascopes all present. As you see the loader refill your tank gun with either High Explosive or Armour Piercing rounds, you feel like Steel Batalion, and that you are really driving around a sluggish piece of metal with death able to come in an eyeblink.A very immersive and impressive experience then. Red Orchestra 2 might not be the same for veterans and purists of the original, but to newcomers, Red Orchestra 2 is a very profesional game with a high skill level and a ton of fun to play. and for $20USD, you are getting 300+ hours of experience (while I haven't reached that far myself)At the other end of the spectrum there is Rising Strom; the standalone expansion to Red Orchestra 2, and a damn good one at that.This time it's the Pacific front, with Uncle Sam going against Tojo in a head-on turkey shoot, with the Yanks and the Japs in the firing line (Americans VS Japanese)The gameplay is basically the same as Red Orchestra 2's, with the only changes being American/Jap weapons, No tanks (sad face :( ) and MUCh less of asymetrical gameplay. The American side is VASTLY overpowered with Thompsons and Flamethrowers, and can steamroll the Japs, sometimes.SOMETIMES.The Japs are more specialised, and they are able to plant booby traps-and they have Swords.Yes you weeabo nitwits: THEY HAVE KATANAS, and they can do morale sapping BANZAI!! charges against the Yanks.While not that effective, it is AWESOME when it pays off.Rising Strom is also much easier than Red Orchestra 2 for newcomers, and it isn't as... ""grimdark"" as the Eastern FrontBut Rising Storm is a VERY good EXPANSION PACK (not DLC) and you are getting an entire full game for half the price.To conclude: Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 is a VERY intense and fun game, that sinks it's teeth into you, and never lets you go, if you let it. If you ever wanted to play a game that REALLY simulates World War 2 the RIGHT way, then you have found the Holy Grail.Easily a 4.5/5[And as a side note: one of the mods for this game: ""Heroes of the West"" simulates the Western Front with the Americans against the Germans. It's still in progress, so it's not ready yet. but deffinatley something to look forward to if you get this game][Also: the best server for the game is Merrill's Marauders Pacifiic/Stalingrad campaign. Check them out on their website at http://www.475thrangers.com/ (Seriously it's worth it) ]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I enjoy it alot and recommend to anybody who likes action and realism.Reasons:- no 3rd person, so no everpresent jackassing known in Arma 3- HUD is hidden most of the time, improving the immersion much.- difficult to play, but very rewarding both wits & skills- TANKS that are quite realistic and enjoyable- no better multiplayer game focused on infantry and combined operations at this moment. Sorry, BF3/BF4 is fun for boys.Being addicted to RO2 doesn't mean I don't see its flaws. Quite many of them actually:- lame interface programming- lack of positional voice communications (ACRE!)- no simulation of speed of sound- Hollywood bullet whizzing instead of sonic cracks- role voting has been removed- poor network coding (in MP game!) - lots of presumably local events must be confirmed by server.- no automatic detection of possible weapon support positions- realism suffers from streamlining: people sprint unbelievably fast to increase tension; bullets fly faster than IRL to counterbalance it..- leveling leads to absurdal situations; lvl 50 machine guns can be fired with almost no penalty from hip- using meelee makes your character stop in place- cannot throw grenades away- cannot throw satchel charges away- tanks are coded awfully to say the least- only two types of tanks, no APCs, cannonsOverall: Good			",92,19,3,17,26,2,34

												Rising Storm is an expansion pack for Red Orchestra 2, but it's practically a stand alone title since you don't need RO2. This is by far my favorite WWII game I have ever played! The guns feel realistic, the explosions make you jump every time, and it is also one of the most realistic games I've played in a while, even without those fancy graphics. The controls feel tight and smooth, the ranking system is superb, and every match feels like it's own war. If you enjoy an FPS or a good game, buy this.			",46,13,0,7,7,0,4

If you love war games with a realistic touch to them, RO2/RS is the way to go.                 -PROS--Great Graphics (Maxed out for me)-Realism (I get the chills when i'm being suppressed)-So much action you can't get enough!-Easy controls (I'm a fast learner so i got attached quickly)-64 players-Good Community-Still being updated                -Cons--Alot of servers lag, (EX: Server browser says 24 ping, in game 215+ even the closest one for me *Chicago* has a ping on 150+Buy it you wont regret it if your into that realism :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There's a lot of love put into this awesome game, which despite the awful launch, it managed to stay afloat thanks to Tripwire and their numerous efforts to keep the game's player base healthy, listening to feedback, featuring mods and community maps, and releasing tons of content for absolutely free.My favourite shooter on Steam, and one of my favourite games ever.10+/10			",644,146,32,90,80,9,123

												------------------LETTER TO MILENKA, YEAR 1945------------------------Hello my dear Milenka:I miss you. I miss you every single day in this battlefield.I'm really scared. Scared because I don't know when I will take a bullet to my head as some of my lovely comrades did. I still can remember Pyotr, it was horrible. He was next to me, it happened so fast that I couldn't even react. We were in some building in Spartanovka, and I was shi-tting my pants in a corner when he came running to help me. Pyotr knew how to choose his words to cheer me up: ""noob team we can't win. X TOY MACHIINE WHAT ARE YOU DOIN IN THE CORNER CY-KA BLY-AT. CY-KA BLY-AT IDI NA-HUI YOU FUKN IDI-OT"". I was proud of him after that, he was a true alpha a true leader that would lead Russian army to the victory. But then, in half a second; bullet sounds were around us, and Pyotr was in the floor, splitting blood while his eyes stared at me. I couldn't handle my tears and I ran to him, kneel down and heard his last words: ""AFK"" while he passed out. I will never forget Pyotr voice. I will never forget the love I feel for you.All yours,---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			",72,7,1,5,1,0,3

												This game is fantastic. You get a vague feeling of really being on the eastern front / pacific theater. You will need both your eyes and ears when playing this game. What is even better is that the game is like a living museum in some way. Weapons sound different, depending on their kind and even their distance. After a bunch of games, you might be able to hear if there are enemies or friendlies shooting near you. Then there are the amazingly detailed tanks and buildings. Some maps can look familiar if you've seen some Stalingrad documentaries.There is a steep difficulty curve. You can't just go Rambo on everyone. Knowing your weapon and the aprox. magazine size is also vital for your survival. Give it a try at a free weekend before buying.MP40 double magazine was here; PPSH can go have intercourse with itself			",148,17,3,11,7,1,34

												The first thing that I'm going to say in this review is that you will die in this game. A LOT. However, thats some of the fun as you learn to master covering from fire and tactics. I've got to say, after playing this game thus far, no other FPS I've ever played other than those of the ARMA franchise has come even close in terms of scale, realism, and strict reliance of teamwork. Yes, it might be a much slower paced shooter than your generic run and gun game, but the slower pace only helps to reinforce the realism of how war isn't all about just shooting the bad guys, but about tactics and teamwork. Without strong teamwork, you will almost always lose. The guns are all balanced and realistic with an interesting distance adjuster, and the way that the class system works, you always end up with a balanced team instead of a team filled with only snipers and machine gunners. The gunplay is fantastic, and the fact that there is a cover system, something sorely lacking in most modern military FPS's, was just icing on the cake for me. If you are even remotely interested in a historic military game or one based more on tactics than trigger fingers, then this is the game for you.			",70,12,3,6,5,0,5

												This game is a team based, tactical shooter in military simluation style. With the two main game diffilculties being Action and Realism. Realism is the preferred option, and most servers will use this. The game is unforgiving and has a steep learning curve. With one shot deaths, and a suppression system. The game does not involve much in terms of ballistics physics, but it does not remove much from the gameplay. If your looking for a great realistic WW2 shooter, then this is your ticket, if your looking for a WW2 counter strike, you should look somewhere else!			",137,6,1,12,38,0,39

												This Game is a Masterpiece. I never felt so, so Sad about Soldiers being killed by either Gunshot Wounds or Explosions. Every corner you look, you'll either see bullets flying by your head, or you'll see dead corpses lying on the ground wishing that was you lying there. Crys of your Fallen Comrades are heard everywhere wishing you could help but you can't. Commands are given to you and if you don't proceed to do them, you'll fail your Team. This game isn't a Go Out, Guns Blazing! Nor is it an Easy Game to get through. No This is Red Orchestra: Heroes Of Stalingrad! Every Movement you make matters in this game. Every corner you turn decides your Fate. Every Descision you make determines the Fate of you and your Teammates. I highly recommend this Game. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am a casual gamer and introduced to the franchise after RO2. This game started as a terrible game. Performance issues, balancing issues and all sorts of problems you can get from rushed launch. Tropwire took there sweet time to fix most of the lingering issues, but now I am saying with full confidence that this is one of the better FPS on PC. The whole experince is unique and shooting feels way more different then the likes of COD or BFs. Though community is small, but all of them are dedicated which results in faboulus gaming sessions. It has a slight learning curve and game dosent explain well the fundamentals. You need to learn it through Youtube are spending few hours in the game messing around. Basically it plays more like the RUSH mode from Battlefield series.SP and COOP portion of the game is as good as non existent. Game is regularly updated with new maps. Even a new DLC was given for free with slight restrictions. All in all I am a highly satisfied with the efforts of DEVS to improve the game.If you like FPS games with a slight learning curve and teamplay then this game is ideal for you.			",132,8,7,9,8,1,18

												Why i Love Rising Storm!This is my favourite game of all time, Before i found rising storm i was a big strategy gamer mainly total war. Shogun 2 got me interested in the Japanese and i started having a look at its history. By early 2014 i was all the way into the Imperial Japan era and i wanted to play a game based around then. Now there really arent many games set in the pacific which is a shame since its such a interesting era and theatre of war but i managed to stumble across a game called Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm. Now when i played this i was blown away....Not only did it not spam you with DLC it gave me both expansions for free! it was realisitic! proper bullet times and factors for each gun! each gun made in perfect detail with all its flaws and advantages as in real life, never has firing a type 38 arisaka or a kar98k been so entertaining in a game for me. even after playing all the maps hundreds of times it never gets old because the community is so fun.The team work is like no other. this isnt battlefield where everyone runs off doing their own thing people work together in this to achieve victory its simply amazing!. The native voice acting for the Germans Russians (American voices are pretty bad though) and Japanese is simply outstanding the japanese even have a Kansai dialect for added detail, its absolutely insane the gun play is awesome the push and shove of battle feels real. even when you see a flash 200m away and half a second later your dead does it not fail to impress. the realisim is done perfectly in time with the fun. Most of the few Pacific War games are rather historically innacurate without mods. But rising storm Nails everything prefectly (except for the SNLF having later date uniforms when they should have green but a mutator fixed this as well as being put on some servers) This Game to me is more immersive then a movie like saving private ryan its, i literally get excited to just jump on and play every time. I have even put 100 hours into the Steam Offline mode wih bots it never fails to entertain me.So people coming here looking for a reason to buy i guarantee you Rising Storm will not disapoint you if you want something realisitic and historically accurate. and for the fun its just so worth it.MUTATORS/MODS I RECCOMEND TO IMPROVE EXPERIANCE.Beta SNLF: This changes the Khaki SNLF skins to the correct for timeframe Green Naval Uniforms. this is literally the only gripe i have in the realisim department so i reccomend this if you want to see the Japanese Marines in the correct garb (the previous is also correct but like late 1945 not 1943)

												This is pretty much a multiplayer only game, reviewing it as such is crucial.  If you're looking for a single player experience, look elsewhere.  That being said, this game is amazing.  RO2 is a modern looking, realistic WW2 FPS.  Though it started out with more than a few bugs, it has been updated and polished quite nicely over the years.  Before I get into details, I'll also include that you will get to experience both the Eastern front as well as the island battles of the Pacific Theatre, easily one of the most unique features about this game.Gameplay is quite fluid.  Moving around the map, crouching, sprinting, all feel quite good and realistic.  Sounds, weapons, chatter, maps, and skins all create an immersive atmosphere.  The horrors of war will be on full display the minute you step into a populated server and you're going to love every second of it.Though the learning curve of RO2 is moderate to high for most, which I personally love, this is ultimately a game of realism.    You will most certainly die from one well placed shot, but you can also do alot of damage with one placed shot yourself.  Though, one man can do quite a bit of damage to the enemy if he knows what he's doing, this game stresses teamwork tactics and sticking close to your squad mates.  Getting into cap zones, and picking guys off from there is the name of the game.  Working with your teammates and coordination is key.  You won't find much in regards to Rambo'ing around the map as it simply won't work unless your an experienced veteran.Easily one of the more realistic WW2 shooters out currently.  I've played this game since launch, and over the last few years, the game has made great strides towards being very, very good.  With the most recent update, which included the release of the MG42, battles on the Eastern front feel about ten times more intense.  Worth every penny, would buy again.			",114,3,0,10,7,0,11

												This game is the most immersive, engaging, atmospheric, and brutal WW2 shooter on the market. It's like every life you are the director of your own war movie but without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ romance subplots. The pacing is brilliant, sometimes you will slowly moving up on the flank hearing a couple shots once in a while and a stray bullet might go over your head. Another time you will be pinned down by heavy fire in a foxhole with your friends just trying to desperately return fire. The sound design in this game is phenomenal, every bullet and gun has a brutal impact. The recoil is hefty and honest. The ragdolls are immersive especially the death screams and the way the bodies just lean against things just adds to the complete WW2 experience. Seriously addicting game. If you are a WW2 multiplayer fanatic and you haven't played this game, you are doing yourself a great dishonor.			",123,5,0,13,11,1,16

												This game is ridiculously underrated. It is one of (if not the most) atmospheric fps game i've ever played!I remembered when i was running towards the objective with some of my comrades, and then we're hit by enemy's artillery. We hit the deck and start crawling in cover, with artillery raining on us. Exactly at that moment, a dramatic piano music in-game started playing. Man it was so dramatic and epic.Seriously, buy this game. 10/10.			",81,7,4,13,5,1,21

												No other game can sum up the experience of your first time logging into Red Orchestra 2. My own experience filled me with adrenaline, fear, and shock. Watching my Russian comrades screaming about the enemy tank coming down the road, getting sniped standing right next to me, and the wave of bullets that flew over head....it was amazing. This I consider to be on of the best realistic World War 2 games out there. I always play on a realism server, the action servers have less damage so putting 3 clips into a guy doesnt kill him....its crap, the only real way to exzperience this game is realism. The leveling up system for guns makes you better over time, and really makes you feel like you are a war vet slowly getting better at raging war. I would suggest this game to anyone looking for a good WW2 shooter.			",121,24,1,18,11,0,24

												I play this game on lowest graphics settings, on a laptop that is just on minimum spec for the game. It is still an immersive, exhilarating experience.The Russian uniforms are slightly more brown than grey. The German uniforms are slightly more grey than brown. They both bleed red explosively when you shoot them. They both fall suddenly with similar gurgled screams.No other game has made me feel sorry for the people I kill, whether friendly or enemy.If you like fast paced, run and gun shooters with plenty of explosions, don't get this game.If you like waiting around, watching the same patch of landscape for a few minutes, changing position, repeating these steps, hiding from artillery, and then screaming through the most intense 10 second firefight of your life, get this game.If you like quick respawns and CoD style self healing, don't get this game.If you like having to bandage your wounds (if you manage to survive a bullet wound, a rare occurrence), or having to wait for your guy to calm down after a salvo flies past his head and reduces your comrade to mush before you can see properly again, get this game.If you like hearing men cry for their mothers as they bleed to death beside you, get this game.There's ballistic drop. There's an ammo counter that only keeps track of magazines. Your MG will overheat. You will be killed from 150m away without knowing how. You will feel tense whilst playing this game. I'm still not sure I enjoy it. But I keep coming back.There is a slight problem on the odd server where people don't play the objective and that side pays the price quickly. But I don't think it's down to noob team members. Being in an objective zone is always brown trousers time. It takes courage to go in.I mostly play the Red Orchestra maps, because both sides have bolt action rifles and there's a lot more urban warfare. To me it feels grittier.There's nothing wrong with the Rising Storm maps. It's just that playing as America, any amount of Japanese charging is terrifying, especially when you thought they were part of the bushes.And playing as Japan... well, even I was screaming as I watched my hands melt in front of my eyes, cursing the flamethrower and every member of his family, past, present and future.

												For anyone looking for a combination of realism and FPS fun, Red Orchestra 2 is an absolute must play. A WWII shooter worth checking out, RO2 and it's expansion Rising Storm give us some of the most amazing multiplayer battles ever seen on a mass scale of infantry combat. There are sometimes vehicles but they play a very minor role overall, in this game it's all about the gritty troop combat.			",458,73,7,72,35,0,38

The Realism Game Mod is the most funn here , sure for someone is that pure hardcore , but for veterans this is simply the most enjoable Gameplay ever.This game looks on the first a bit ""Out Dated"" on the graphics , physics etc , but when u get a fev round's done , you apsolutely will positive suprised of the whole gameplay , that im sure , if you like War Games , you will ignore that Outdated stuff..Im new to the game , but not new the FPS , and i Highly recommended this one..PS: Because i know a lot of newbies prefer more to play offline agains Bots , to have something like a Battle Training , this is here posible to trough the in-game workshop option , where you can get a lot of new maps , weapons skins/sounds , and actually everything that you can find in the Games Steam Workshop..

												An amazing game, probably my favourite multiplayer online FPS and certainly one of the best war games ever made. Experience amazing, exciting battles where teamwork is key, classes actually matter and tactics take a huge role in the matches final outcome.The graphics are still very good, the game runs quite smoothly and has been polished throughout the last few years, now being complete with the Rising Storm expansion that improves upon this already amazing game with a more versatile, action oriented gameplay without losing it's realist focus.There are stats and stat rewards to keep you going, none of them making the game unbalanced but giving you slight advantages over low level players that actually make for a very interesting, rewarding progression system.It's an amazing game, and i'd recomend it any day.9.5/10			",52,0,0,5,3,0,4

												Really challenging and fun, you get a very realistic experience of WW2. It is a FPS with a good cover system, so you needn't worry that much, unless the part of your cover is visible. As it is realistic, you can die with 3 or less bullets, depending on the weapon your enemy is using. You get to use tanks or just the infantry; for infantry, you have a variety of classes: Rifleman, Squad Leader, Machinegunner, etc. Each of them has different wapons (determinant) and purposes in the battle. Overall, this game is very good, I've noticed very few flaws in this, so I recommend it.			",91,9,3,4,5,0,1

												Red Orchestra 2 / Rising Storm is a must for anyone who enjoys a WWII FPS that rewards team work. The game has superb map design and makes good use of its realistic damage and ballistics models. That being said, it is certainly a steep learning curve for those coming from the likes of CoD or BF where it takes near a full magazine to get a kill; accuracy is hard to achieve and it can be hard to differentiate friend from foe. All in all, RO2/RS is a superb buy for those who are willing to put the time into getting used to it and few other games reward teamwork as much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing. Just gonna put it out there. Don't judge me on how little hours i put into it, I'm working on that. But i bought rising storm back when it was on sale so i shouldn't really be here, but anyways. Play this game if you are into realism. Don't play this game if you regard Call of Doots as realistic. Honestly. I was in a game one time and a guy on my team called out someone for ""camping"". Long story short, he got verbally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by everyone on the server who were shouting things like ""GO BACK TO COD"" ""COME BACK WHEN YO LEARN HOW TO BE A MAN"", etc etc. Point is, don't come into this game expecting it to be easy. Expect to die, a lot. The community is actually really friendly and helpful if you don't act like a complete fool and go playing this game like rambo. If you do that you will earn no respect and wont have any fun, Because thats not what this game is about. Hope this helped a bit, I would give it 10 blown up soldiers out of 10.			",69,5,0,3,8,0,9

												You will hate this game. You will be stomped like the maggot which you are and you will be spat on. You will be given nothing, for you deserve nothing. You will be hammered like a cold piece of iron and you will be bent into shape. Your humanity will be stripped from you, for you do not deserve to be human. You will be sent to hell and back. You will be forged in the fires of artillery. You will watch your fellow maggots mowed down one by one. And you will live through it all. You will remember listening to their screams, covered in their blood and guts. Your defeat will be relieving. Your victory will be sweet.And after playing this game, you may call yourself a man.

												My favourite WWII shooter that I have ever played, from a multiplayer perspective. The intensity and detail of the game, from the weapons, uniforms/equipment etc, more than make up for the lack of large maps and variety of vehicles that Ostfront had. RO2 itself is a pleasure to play and in my experience has a very mature community. It's always fun to jump into. Once on a good server, the combat and communication between team mates make for an intense, exhilirating and/or frustrating (Depending on who's winning) scenario. I recommend this game for anynone who likes gritty and unforgiving WWII shooters where no ammo counter or crosshair is present (Unless you play action mode), the realism mode is where this game stands out. The free aim system is a big plus, and the detail is excellent right down to the animations and weapon models, which even have adjustable iron sights. The implementation of recoil, and the suppression system work very well to reduce the effectiveness of a pinned sniper and spray and prayer types. 9.5/10 - Great Game, especially when you have a squad of friends on the go.

The weapons feel and sound just as they would in real life the PPSH 41, DP 28, Mosin 91/30 all feel real and find them very enjoyable to play. You can play as a TL and call support for your team or you can SL and lead your squad to victory or just be conscript all roles are enjoyable. The uniforms are also accurate for the time the pre-Stalingrad uniforms are my favorite Soviet uniform. The Tanks are very enjoyable the F-34 Tank gun on the T-34-76 is just as it is in real life switching between positions is very fun, When playing as a tank squad with freinds it can be very enjoyable (DT 28 dishgun mounted on the hull of T-34-76 is OP).

												Bought this game for Rising Storm only to be honest. Very great game! It isn't a spray 'n' pray game but a REAL tactic FPS game. The Japanese are strong in will and courage and have a variety of weapons. They also can do boobytraps and banzai charges. The Americans have the flamethrower and with a greater range than any other WWII FPS game until now. Like WWII FPS games? Wanna play tactical and not just shooting dumbway around? Then grab this game because it is great greatnessWhy can't I quit??90% Awesomenessこのゲームは凄く楽しい。日本人の兵士の万歳は凄く強い。もしFPSゲーム好きならこのゲーム絶対買って下さい。　じゃね～			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cons:-Great WWII shooter in a market saturated by shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield-The Eastern Front portion of the game is extremely well balanced with the Germans having an edge in machine guns, authomatic rifles and pistols but with the Russians having the edge in Submachineguns, tanks and the  Urah charge. -Historically accurate, rare for any shooter-Very mature community-Nonrepititive gameplay that will allow one to sink hours into it without it being bored whatsoever. -Killing is very rewarding in the game, I have no idea why. -Includes the Pacific Theatre of War-Multiple vehicle classes such as the half-track, lighttank and medium tank. -Great system of leveling up-The ability to mod-Great for cheaper systems. Cons: -Game can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to run sometimes, program prone to not responding-The American forces are OP compared to the Japanese, which they're always fighting unless you have mods. -Lack of servers and players. -Too many veteran ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on the game that act like they're in charge of everything because they've been to Iraq or whatever-They didn't include Heavy tanks in the game-The maps are massive but only in one regard. For example, the map ""Bridges of Druzhina"" is probably 3 kilometers long but only .5 wide. Same with Red October Factory and Spartanovka. More ""square"" maps should have been implemented!-Too much coordination between team members needed to enjoy the game. It's pretty common to have one team stomping on the other because a new player has taken the commander slot and refuses to give it up. Same with the squad leaders who are supposed to be mobile spawn points but you always have people getting their heads blown off. 7.5/10 Could have been better, but it's a WWII shooter and I'm a massive fan of that genre so I can let it slide.

												Litterally one of the BEST games I have ever played. If I were to try and tell you all the things that make RO2 a fantastic title, there wouldnt be enough time, so instead Ill sum it up in a few points and then conclude.-Pretty Decent Graphics(for those who care)-AMAZING gunplay and ballistics handling -More realistic Damage model compared to most shooters-Immersive atmosphere -Fantastic voice acting(The native voices that is, IE, in the game theres an option to enable German and Russian for the two factions)-Great emphasis on Teamwork, this is one of the few games where if you dont work as a team, you actually get destroyed.-Lastly, while the active community is smaller compared to some games [averages a peak of approx. 1,800 players on most days] it is a very welcoming and friendly one, and most people are pretty cool. =Warning= If you are going to be a new player, play the tutorials for each class role or read some guides made by vets, the only thing that will upset vets in this game is when newbies pick important roles such as the TL or SL and dont know what their doing =END OF WARNING=In conclusion, if you want a ww2 game with great gameplay thats pretty authentic as well as serious and fun then look no further this is definitly the game for you. I hope you decide to get the game and if you do I usually play on Merills stalingrad server, ober* server or weekend warriors.

												As I cower behind my cover while me and my squad are heavily suppressed I see my squad leader turn to us and then stand out of cover to try to get a shot at the enemy only for him to take a bullet in the gut. The enemy didn't even give him the curtosey of finishing him off...they let him just bleed there holding his stomach as he screamed ""I'll be okay don't worry about me just move!"" and then he faded. He took one last breath as he stared out into the battlefield then dropped onto the floor...lifeless. I turn to my comrades and announce we should execute one final push. They all agree and with our bayonets ready we ran between the broken down buildings in the snowy ruins as one by one my men eat lead. I kept sprinting in for my target...my prey and managed to drive my bayonet through his eye only for the machinegunner next to him to pull out his pistol and fire a round into my temple...we lost...but fought bravely...for the honour of our squad leader...10/10 would get ptsd again			",207,9,2,14,9,0,12

												I only played a 3 day trial, it was the most fun from a first person shooter in ages, holding off a massive assault in a well defended position makes you feel you could take on the whole army, and joining your comrades in an all out assault makes your hairs stand on end. I love how many of the maps look like the real location (from pictures of the time) most notably Iwo Jima (my fav map btw) this game looks fantastic, it feels fantastic (controls are hard to get used to if you are not used to first person shooters, i myself keep trying to use V.A.T.S out of instinct i play fallout too much. I love manual bolting of rifles, and i love the reload animations, its not like other games where the empty mag you pulled out magically refills its self and you put it back in the gun, you actually feel like you dropped an empy mag and searched in your pack for a replacement.my only peeve with this game is WHY ARE THE GERMAN SOLDIERS SPEAKING ENGLISH, but the Japanese soldiers speak Japanese?Edit, i have since learned it is an option in the audio menu, fixed, this game is perfect now 10/109.9/10			",31,0,0,12,5,0,11

Playability is huge and mapping of real weapons, equipment and troops is outstanding.  The graphics aren't the most important thing in this type of games, according to me the graphics are good enough.

												This WWII eastern front FPS will throw you right into the trenches! Awareness and allies are all you have standing between your brain and the bullets of your enemy. With enchanced gameplay during Realistic Mode play, Red Orchestra 2 offers a more authentic war atmosphere at the cost of casual gamer's sanity. Capture and hold key positions in order to advance on enemy lines while keeping on the lookout for the ever present eyes of the enemy. This game rewards teamwork, stealth tactics, weapon supremacy, and skill in various and sometimes surprising ways. WIth my little experience in the game, I have found that the learning curve is higher than that of common FPS games, but easily surmountable within a few maps. Heroes of Stalingrad also features a solo campaign for those who want some story or the chance to learn the game at their own pace.With all that said, I find it hard to locate much fault in this game. It may not be as flashy as some of the more popular war games, but Red Orchestra 2 promotes itself with soild gameplay and much honor to be bestowed to those who are willing to learn.

												Also review for Rising Storm mod.  RS and RO2 is one of the best and unique gaming experiences out there.  Especially, if you are sick of the soft, call of duty, battlefieldish type of games. This game is more realistic and teamwork orriented than the average AAA, fps on the market.  It takes some time but not a lot to get decent at it, but once you do understand the games core conspects you will enjoy yourself.  The value of Rising Storm is immense, if you buy just RS, you will also get the RO2 mp for free as well and considering it goes on sale fore $5 that's alot of entertainment to be had for the money.   Overall and unique, fun and cheap game, if you but a little effort in to learning how to play; then you will be reward with tons of fun.			",69,11,1,15,8,2,13

												A fun, actually realistic stratergy Multiplayer shooting gameThis game offers a immense soundtrack and theme, with beautiful looking mapsOnly downside is the community, half of it is amazing and one of the best i have found, the other? Extreme racism and slander from casuals at all fronts, but finding a good reliable server to regular on solves everything. The game actually offers a rather interesting leveling up system, what rewards you well with every game through unlocks. Bugs are still everywhere, but none of them are big or game breaking, just minor and hardly worth noting.The game delivers extremely smooth optimisation and frames at all ranges on every map, no spikes regardless of 10 players or 64 players and dozens of mortars.... Overall 8/10, Great to see the franchise Progressing so well, without selling out!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Orchestra 2 is as you might seen set in the eastern front of the second world war. Its also really focused in bringing a realistic gameplay that no other game i have seen can match, bandaging advanced wounds with cons (You can get shot in the leg etc). On your time in RO2 you will get some attachments for each weapon drum mag, bayonet etc. Some of these are should not really be ingame like the dual mag mp40.

												Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm is my all time favorite shooter. It is the only game, that makes me anxious about how long I will live. The screams, the sounds of your comrads dying, the body parts flying everywhere when a grenade explodes, the team killing...This is not a run and gun game. In this game, there is no unlimmited ammo with your primary weapon, no digital crosshairs, no healthbar, no health recharge, no medics (althought that would be fantastic) and its the best shooter out there today. If you are new to the game, which I was at first never having played RO1, its best to do the Single player IF ONLY for weapon training and to learn the basics. The single player, is worthless, and anyone will agree with me on that end. This is a very realistic game...hold the trigger to an MG to long, and youll just be spraying and praying, instead, do short controlled trigger bursts of 5-7 shots. With the exception of the assult class, most guns are single shot, non-automatic firing weapons, you shoot, you load you shoot again, no holding the trigger down. In this game, when you kill someone, they deserved to die, because they werent prone, they werent covering, or they werent paying attention...all of this will frustrate you, all the dying...and thats good, it will weed out those that will do more to hurt your team than help it. Get this game, ITS ALWAYS ON SALE! TRIPWIRE GAMES ARE ALWAYS ON SALE!			",290,207,20,32,30,3,50

												Red Orchestra was one of the best games, if not the best, which i have purchased on steam. The intense realism and brutality of war in unmatched by any other game, making it a truly exciting game (or simulator?) to behold; whether its charging the American lines as a Japanese suicide charger, or crawling through the mud as a Russian sniper before taking out Jerry, this game appeals to all paces of combat.Yet the feature which most stood out, mostly, are the drivable and fully detailed interiors of the tanks and APC's. Such levels of detail just doesn't exist in other online games; looking around and seeing your crewmates in the tank (real people too) just makes it seem all that more believable, something other FPS's won't achieve.10/10 T34's driven, worth a buy!.

												Ever wanted to feel on the front? Know what is on the mind of a WW2 frontline soldier/officer/commander on the German/Russian side? Well, here's your chance. the most realistic WW2 FPS game you can find is here, not your regular fps where you can get what you want, here, you will get what they give you, for instance, do you think the germans made enough mp-40 submachineguns for ALL their soldiers? NO! only officers could have them, so you my friend, is probably gonna get a kar98 bolt action rifle. THE REAL MAN'S RIFLE, to see if you are as skilled as a german soldier. Think of it as a real life challenge: most players have rifles that require skill to shoot, some have submachineguns, some have lightmachineguns and just a few have sniper rifles, so running may be a good idea, togheter with hiding on cover, but keep in mind that you are not alone and team tactics are the welcome, togheter with officers using microphones to tell you the strategy. You want a real man's game or a baby's fps? Make your choice.			",88,7,1,5,14,1,7

												Red Orchestra 2 is what filled the void when Call of Duty 2 multiplayer all but vanished into obscurity. Not just a straight replacement, but a move towards more realism and tactics and on a slightly larger scale. It was a bit of a leap, but well worth learning those extra controls. The weapons have weight to them, and the maps are fantastic. Very healthy multiplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: June 8, 2013
												One of the most humbling games I have ever played. If you played CoD when it was fun (CoD 1-4) and are considering buying this game, be prepared for a shock. This game takes the realism and immersion of sims like Arma, but keeps you in the action by taking out the parts in Arma where you trek for miles with no idea where the enemy or your squad is, and focuses more on the action. Remember how in CoD your character, even on veteran, could soak up bullets like a sponge, red jelly seemingly leaking out of his eyeballs, then duck behind cover and ""squeeze"" out the damage he had taken moments before? Forget that. Forget the crosshair in the middle of your screen. Forget when you would pick up a PPSH in CoD 2, fire off the entire magazine at the same target with nary a spot of recoil to be seen. Forget the ability of your character to sprint through an artillery barrage, dash across a field while being sprayed with MG-42 fire, and take out a tank singehandedly with nothing but your trusty TNT without even flinching. Try anything of the sort in this game, and, assuming you aren't instantly torn apart, your screen's color will drain away, your heart will be pounding, and you will find aiming immpossible. And I don't mean just in the game. Each side, Axis and Allies, has its own strengths and weaknesses (although the Wermacht has few of the latter). Playing as the Soviet Union, unless you manage to snag one of the few special classes, such as sniper or commander, quickly turns into a meat-grinder experience, just as it would have been in real life. Playing as a rifleman, for example, will give you a Moison-Nagant 1895, two grenades and a life expectancy of about 30 seconds. You will charge across a field to a capture point which appears to be empty, and moments later a machine gun you never saw will open up from a window you forgot to check, or from behind a wall you passed without waiting for your team-mates to cover, and your brief, often pointless life will be over, as your squad members are often cut down around your darkening vision. Often a game spent as one of the more aggresive classes will turn in three steps: Spawn, die, repeat. Sometimes you will die without firing a shot. This may sound dull, painful, or frustrating. In your first online match you may not get more than one kill. The learning curve in this game is quite steep, and this discourages many people. But eventually you will begin to learn the quirks, tricks, and rewards of each class. If you are patient, cautious, and lucky, just as the real veterans of the battle of Stalingrad had to be, and you will improve. Your name will move up the scoreboard, and you will begin to reap the rewards of the time you invest a hundred times over. This is when the game becomes the most fun. You will unlock bayonets, scopes, and new guns, and your player model will begin to show the wear and tear of surviving the battles, with medals, extra ammo and camo. All in all, probably my favorite shooter of all time. The community is mature, and welcoming to new players. Stay away from the single player mode, and don't try the tank combat, and you will grow to love this beautiful, grim, and challenging video game.			",53,7,0,5,3,0,16

												FPS with a very different feel than most. With 64 players in a game, compared to popular fps this one is much slower but still action based. Mistakes are more likely to be punished. You cannot simply run in the open by yourself, you will be shot by any number of enemies looking for movement. The different roles and guns and misc items restricted to them make for a good team based war game.			",143,26,1,23,17,1,17

												Red Orchestra 2 is the best ptsd simulator I have and may ever have played. It isn’t one of the best first person shooters or multiplayer games out there, and not necessarily the best WW2 game, and its single player isn’t particularly good at all. But without a doubt, the killing, the being killed and the plenty of in-between there is in this game makes Red Orchestra 2 a terrifying but great experience.In this game, you are in one of four armies, Stalin's Russia, Hitler's Germany, Tojo's Japan or Roosevelt's Americanos. A large percentage of the time spent in this game is having your back to the wall sh*t scared. There's bullets and shrapnel flying from every direction and you've got sh*t in your pants and countless deaths already. Every corner in this game, every room, nook and cranny can and will conceal someone from the opposing team, firing at you from every possible angle imaginable. The cover system in this game isn’t necessarily great (although the blind firing is pretty nice) but it works, so I'll give it that.You've seen an enemy soldier, he's shot you or you've shot him and now he's dead. It's exactly like a million other games, but it feels nothing like any other game. the little things that make the difference, such as the sound of your own breathing when you lifted the rifle to your eye, and the way it bobbed around slightly in your hands. It's in the mark on your enemy's chest where the bullet hit, and the way his blood spurted from his back, making the mark of entry. The way they fell, with some weight to it like a real person. The way he clutches his stomach, yelling in German, the way he clutches and pulls the trigger madly firing the last ammo in his gun before departing.The developers of this game thought that if the main interaction of the game is to kill, and kill and kill. You should probably make it feel great. It's the attention to detail that turns this from a generic war shooter to a battlefield. It makes it something great, making you feel more like you're the one actually pulling the trigger. The limited hud really adds to this; and I love the fact that you have to check the ammo in your magazine rather than having a counter in the corner of your screen.The game modes are also great and fairly interesting. The most popular one is Territory, in which the offensive team is meant to capture multiple points on the map, whilst the other is to defend them. In this game each team has reinforcements which spawn every 15-20 seconds. The maps are made and designed to support 64 players. The reinforcement system works greatly because it finds a good way to deal with respawns and involve them with the setting of the game. These reinforcements allow the players to concentrate on the shifting frontline, going backwards and backwards until the offensive team has taken the map. Countdown mode has similar objectives, but players get just 1 life per round, where the teams swap sides halfway through, similar to how it works in games like competitive game modes in games like Counter Strike. Firefight, a team deathmatch variant to the game is fairly popular but feels as if it doesn’t really belong in the game. Territory is the only real active gamemode as of now.The weapons feel remarkable, and the classes that carry them are fairly familiar from other games. The assault class with an SMG, a marksman sniper class, a rifleman and an elite rifleman variant as well as a few others like the tank commander or engineer. The few inventive classes such as Commanders or Squad leaders do little to change the flow of gameplay however. Both roles have valuable abilities but the players on public servers rarely interact with one another asking for smokescreens or giving commands as the squad leader.Tanks don’t add much to the experience. They require a different set of skills to use well and have lovingly detailed interiors. They are an easily disposed of or ignored nuisance on the few maps that actually allow the players to utilize them.The many deaths you will go through in this game put you constantly on the edge of your seat. Death is so violent and sudden that you’re constantly kept on edge, an experience made suspenseful by the little pieces of information kept from you by the game.While this game was greatly enjoyable for me for the time i played it, it does not come without its flaws. RO2's bots barely funciton. The AI bots are almost blind, and will walk past and into the opposition without firing, and when they do it appears more to be in their general direction than an accurate shot. They're incredibly indecisive and will keep jumping through the same window and into the same trench repeatedly. If an AI is close enough he will quickly become a master swordsman, attempting to behead you with a katana or stick you with a bayonet like a pig; but, this can all be countered by walking backwards where he will infinitely chase you, most likely never firing.In this game I've seen a machinegunner set up a gun with their backs to the enemy. I've seen them set up on a cabinet, I've seen them set up in their own trench facing away from gunfire. The soldiers have ran in infinite circles where they're unable to navigate a corner or a hallway of a buulding; infinitely retracing their own steps. I've seen allied and enemy tanks aline drive in a figure of eight indefinetly, or stop in front of me and never fire. This lack of the Artifical intelligence's intelligence makes the single player gamemode completely worthless, as it's a carbon copy of the multiplayer with a few slideshows of historical background inbetween.RO2 is what it is. It’s a realistic World War 2 shooter that does what it does well. It’s a suspenseful and at times terrifying shooter with a unique twist to it. The game immerses you and doesn’t take you out for a while. It caused me to feel sadness upon watching a comrade of mine drop to the ground, and genuine fear when being aimed upon behind flimsy cover by a mounted gun in an apartment building.I enjoyed this game greatly, and as such will give it an 7/10. It’s a fast paced and enjoyable game but nevertheless there are bugs and flaws that lower the rating.Gg would get ptsd again			",80,3,0,8,3,1,2

												Red Orchestra 2 is what filled the void when Call of Duty 2 multiplayer all but vanished into obscurity. Not just a straight replacement, but a move towards more realism and tactics and on a slightly larger scale. It was a bit of a leap, but well worth learning those extra controls. The weapons have weight to them, and the maps are fantastic. Very healthy multiplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Orchestra was one of the best games, if not the best, which i have purchased on steam. The intense realism and brutality of war in unmatched by any other game, making it a truly exciting game (or simulator?) to behold; whether its charging the American lines as a Japanese suicide charger, or crawling through the mud as a Russian sniper before taking out Jerry, this game appeals to all paces of combat.Yet the feature which most stood out, mostly, are the drivable and fully detailed interiors of the tanks and APC's. Such levels of detail just doesn't exist in other online games; looking around and seeing your crewmates in the tank (real people too) just makes it seem all that more believable, something other FPS's won't achieve.10/10 T34's driven, worth a buy!.

												Ever wanted to feel on the front? Know what is on the mind of a WW2 frontline soldier/officer/commander on the German/Russian side? Well, here's your chance. the most realistic WW2 FPS game you can find is here, not your regular fps where you can get what you want, here, you will get what they give you, for instance, do you think the germans made enough mp-40 submachineguns for ALL their soldiers? NO! only officers could have them, so you my friend, is probably gonna get a kar98 bolt action rifle. THE REAL MAN'S RIFLE, to see if you are as skilled as a german soldier. Think of it as a real life challenge: most players have rifles that require skill to shoot, some have submachineguns, some have lightmachineguns and just a few have sniper rifles, so running may be a good idea, togheter with hiding on cover, but keep in mind that you are not alone and team tactics are the welcome, togheter with officers using microphones to tell you the strategy. You want a real man's game or a baby's fps? Make your choice.			",88,7,1,5,14,1,7

												Welcome to the front, Hero !. Red Orchestra 2 Heroes of Stalingrad (And it's expansion Rising Storm) is a great game. Is a realistic WWII set in the eastern front in the battle of Stalingrad (Russians vs Germans), but when I say realistic, I mean REALISTIC. You can die from 1 shot in your body, and when you start playing you may never know who shot you or where you've been shot from.  You're not alone, up to 32 players per side battle each other with vehicles like the the famous Panzer 4. The unreal engine does a magnificent job in graphics, it is a good looking game and you'll need a high end machine to run it a maximum graphics. There are a lot of weapons in this game, though you'll need to pay the Risin Storm DLC to get access to all the other american and japanese classes, so you can only use rifleman until you pay (You have full access in the Germans vs Russians) You can customize your weapons when you level up, like a bayonet for the Kar 98k or the Mosin Nagant, a silencer for a revolver, etc.Overall, Red Orchestra 2 is a good game, but it has bugs and glitches that doesn't make it a perfect game, and the campaign is very weak, the missions are only battles with very poor A.I bots.  You shouldn't get this game for a singleplayer experience, because its strenght are the multiplayer matches.I recommend this game a lot, if you like WWII shooters, or realistic shooters, you should get this game and its expansion.

												Red Orchestra 2 is the best WW2 multiplayer shooter you can get! In contrast to BF or COD, Red Orchestra has a slower pace but is more brutal in a sense. That means you can't go in a group of enemies with guns blazing. Instead, you will often do what is considered camping in other games. But while doing so, you will duck and cover in front of your screen, because the game so immersive. The sound effects are top notch, really capture the grim war athomsphere. I only wish the voice overs would be more realistic. I also like that the xp system very much encourages cooperative gameplay instead of lone wolves and snipers.			",35,3,0,6,5,0,14

												I got this game for free. Its okay. Nothing special. 90% of populated server run realism, so no hud so if you're new you're screwed, and everyone has most guns fully leveled or w/e and most servers limit classes so you're usually stuck in as a rifleman. It reminds me of COD 2 because the rifle play is good (but stuck as rifleman for map after map, isn't that fun after a while) and that game was fun, but its slow loading (UE3 isn't this slow but this game loads slow even on a nice rig) and limited servers makes it really hard to get into. I'd still buy it as its really one of the few that is a decent FPS now-a-days but I come from Arma, CoD, BF, CS, etc FPS's so if you havent played RO1 or dont like realism/hc all the time its probably not a great fit unless you want some challenge.7/10 ",150,3,5,28,39,1,36

												It's the most fun way to get PTSD, guranteed. You buy the game, start it up, and join a battle. You pick the Russians if you want to use the Mosin Nagant, or you pick the Germans if you want the Mosin Nagant to be used to kill you, so you pick the Russians. You begin rushing the point like you do in any other FPS, and then some german starts unloading a belt fed MG right around you feet. You♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants, and everything seems like it its black and white. You run into the nearest snow-covered building, and then you peek your head out of the window with your Mosin. You shoot the machinegunner in the head and kill him. You cheer for 5 seconds until you walk out of the building and get an artillery strike called right on top of you. Then you get shell-shocked and want to leave and play something else, but you realize it was the most fun bout of post traumatic stress disorder anyone has ever had.Then you respawn and repeat.IGN 10/10 would get PTSD again.

Playability is huge and mapping of real weapons, equipment and troops is outstanding.  The graphics aren't the most important thing in this type of games, according to me the graphics are good enough. The sound is beautiful.The only issue I had with the servers with PunkBuster, my sound card (Realtek) crashes on such servers.  Only solution is to replace this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ card or satisfaction of the servers without PunkBuster which are also.			",181,59,13,31,15,2,28

												Guadlcanal, August 1942After the landing i was promoted to squad leader. It was some time in the middle of the night when we heard those cans go off. We knew the Japs where coming. My squad Mike, Jackson, Billy, Jake, and Caleb set up firing positions. We waited the tensions grew i knew it was over when i heard ""Banzaiii!."" out of the darkness they came i was never so scared in my life. I lit them up with my Thompson. it was to let they breached our lines they were all around us. I ordered my squad to fall back to the bunker we did. They rest of the base was up and ready to fight. I asked mike to make a run to the commander. He only made it 10 feet before he was shot. we threw nades then i popped smoke and we ran to the red cross station we didn't hold out for long we fell back to the next point i only had 2 mags left. We killed Japs left, right, and centre. Jake was standing next to me when a bullet went though his head. I was down to my pistol Bill and Caleb where in the bunker behind me about 4ft away. I was about to make a run to them when 4 Japs Charged bayonets coming at me. I fired an entire mag only killing one. The Japs stuck me through and through. Bill and Caleb shot the Japs and ran over to me . It was to late i had already bleed out... Sgt BlackJack Guadlcanal 1942, August 13th9/10 would die again...			",37,4,1,2,5,1,6

												Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm is my all time favorite shooter. It is the only game, that makes me anxious about how long I will live. The screams, the sounds of your comrads dying, the body parts flying everywhere when a grenade explodes, the team killing...This is not a run and gun game. In this game, there is no unlimmited ammo with your primary weapon, no digital crosshairs, no healthbar, no health recharge, no medics (althought that would be fantastic) and its the best shooter out there today. If you are new to the game, which I was at first never having played RO1, its best to do the Single player IF ONLY for weapon training and to learn the basics. The single player, is worthless, and anyone will agree with me on that end. This is a very realistic game...hold the trigger to an MG to long, and youll just be spraying and praying, instead, do short controlled trigger bursts of 5-7 shots. With the exception of the assult class, most guns are single shot, non-automatic firing weapons, you shoot, you load you shoot again, no holding the trigger down. In this game, when you kill someone, they deserved to die, because they werent prone, they werent covering, or they werent paying attention...all of this will frustrate you, all the dying...and thats good, it will weed out those that will do more to hurt your team than help it. Get this game, ITS ALWAYS ON SALE! TRIPWIRE GAMES ARE ALWAYS ON SALE!			",290,207,20,32,30,3,50

												Joined a server, picked a side and a class. Spawned 100 meters from objective my team was to defend. After few seconds of running i got killed by a player I will never know from where. And I loved it.Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm are perfect examples of what could've happend if FPS industry went for  realism and difficulty rather than towards effects and grind. Where in Cods and other BFs running around can make you pro, you will die here that way. In Realism mode, one played the most often, you rarely survive a single bullet, and even if, you need to spend a few seconds to bandage the wound, otherwise you bleed out. Because after all, in most of the cases all you are is cannon fodder.Since 4 years this is only MP game, and the most played gamemode is Territory. Two teams fight for contorl over a map, fighting for every field on the regular maps, on which one side is defending and and other attacks. Each province controlled prodives team with 5 combat power, while defending costs 25 and attacking takes 75 of it. Moreover, losing tickets during fight also decreases combat power, so phyrric victories, which are quite common here, arent the best way to go. But what about game itself?Before anything else, you have to pick a class.  They differ by loadouts and role - one of them is not even supposed to fight. There are Assaults with SMGs, MGs with... come on, thats obvious, Snipers and the core: Riflemen. This class takes ~75% of the whole teams, so get accomodated. They are equipped with bolt-action rifles that are really lethal if you know how to use them. Last two classes are Squad leaders and Commander - their roles are tactical so as a newbs stay away from them, as they require proper mic and great game knowldege.So as mentioned earlier, taking over the province requires winning the map. This can be done in few ways. As attacker, you can either take all the points or make enemy team lose all the tickets. As defender, you either make enemy run out of tickets or hold a point till Lockdown timer kicks in. If they fail to take point before lockdown timer runs out, they lose.Remembering that every bullet has potential to kill, this is challenge. Team work is crucial here, and while many games say so - here you can only die alone. Rising Storm is more of the same - only difference is that instead of Europe, we fight in Asia and sides and weapons are different. There are side-excluisve classes, though. Allies have Flamethrowers and Axis has Light mortars (baisicly Riflemen with additional6-rounds mortars). Both these classes are awesome, with Flamers being slightly OP. I have no idea how to say everything that i love about this game. Putting a bayonett into the spine of the mot*******er who took half of the team with MG. Killing enemy Commander. Blowing up Flamer by shooting at his fuel tank. Hundreds of scenes that make you enjoy every minute in this game. There are also bad things: idiot teammates running in front of friendly MG, newbs taking tactical roles, AT class (Seriously - class with slowly firing AT-rifle, pistol and AT grenade, while tanks dont get slighlty damaged by these AT rifles. Great). And - why is there so much fog on every map?All these cons are tiny problems, which shouldn't really take fun - that is, if you manage to get to understand the game and forget about carelessly running into the MG - because here it is a bad idea.

												Although the game has an old age look don't let it fool you, this game has some seriously enjoyable playtime and I find myself always coming back to this game. Yes in the beginning death is regular thing but give it time and learn how the game works and you'll see what I mean when I say I keep coming back for more. If there was any down side to this game I would tell you that there are a few over powered weapons in the game that I think the developers really pushed for to make things seem more balanced *cough* Portable Mortars *cough*. All in all a brilliant game and worth the buy if you are eager to put time and effort into it.			",37,2,3,1,9,0,1

												I only played a 3 day trial, it was the most fun from a first person shooter in ages, holding off a massive assault in a well defended position makes you feel you could take on the whole army, and joining your comrades in an all out assault makes your hairs stand on end. I love how many of the maps look like the real location (from pictures of the time) most notably Iwo Jima (my fav map btw) this game looks fantastic, it feels fantastic (controls are hard to get used to if you are not used to first person shooters, i myself keep trying to use V.A.T.S out of instinct i play fallout too much. I love manual bolting of rifles, and i love the reload animations, its not like other games where the empty mag you pulled out magically refills its self and you put it back in the gun, you actually feel like you dropped an empy mag and searched in your pack for a replacement.my only peeve with this game is WHY ARE THE GERMAN SOLDIERS SPEAKING ENGLISH, but the Japanese soldiers speak Japanese?Edit, i have since learned it is an option in the audio menu, fixed, this game is perfect now 10/109.9/10			",31,0,0,12,5,0,11

												Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad / Rising Storm GOTYPros:- Immersion, immersion, immersion- No biased point of view ( A rare thing in WWII games )- Good gameplay- Good AIMany people have commented on this game being a ""PTSD Simulator"". This claim is far from unjustified. This game is super-immersive ( Even more so when using the Immersion Overhaul Simulator - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/IOMMODplayers ). Realistic graphics, along with good ballistics, suppression affects and an amazing atmosphere of constant danger give this game an edge over other WWII games of the genre.No biased Point of View is another big tick for me. No more evil Germans or unbalanced mechanics that impact how the Germans play. This is a big step forward and a great way of seeing how the front was ACTUALLY LIKE. No more of the lies made up about the Germans by the victors.Gameplay strives to be as realistic as possible, while also catering to beginners. Most weapons take one shot to kill, but are balanced by accuracy and weapon sway, etc. Tank gameplay is extremely impressive with full internal views and great combat elements.The AI are not easy to say the least. They are only slightly less competent than a human player. There are also always servers with lots of bots to practice with.Cons:- Flamethrowers...- Banned From SessionFlamethrowers on this game are fairly unbalaced - and only one nation, the US, gets them. They can be taken out from range, but will take down several people before dying. Not the biggest issue, but definitely something to look out for.There is a possibility that you will be banned from a server for the rest of a session (battle) for having high ping. There is no proper way of fixing this, just join servers with good connection unless you want to take your chances on other servers.*P.S: I play on Oceania ( servers and setups may vary )			",205,29,9,13,23,3,31

												RO2 raises the bar in multiplayer-based shooter realism. There will be no bunny hopping, 360 no scope headshots in this game, ever! It is an exercise in patience, a WW2 simulation where full auto weapons are in short supply, and bolt action rifles make up the bulk of the armaments. Iron sights are almost a requirement for accurate shooting, but a single shot can and often does make a kill. Realistic damage modeling rewards careful marksmanship, and treats a shot in the heart the same as a head shot... an instant kill. However, the effects of limb damage aren't made quite clear, and seem to serve no other purpose than a means to implement the self-applied battlefield bandaging feature.  RO2 is a PC-only shooter, and gives the arcadey big name console ports a run for their money. The standard gameplay mode is tug-of-war style where teams must grab control points in sequence. Each control point is captured via a ""King of the Hill"" style mini-tug-of-war by the team who can maintain a higher player count within the ""hill's"" borders. Thus, contrary to arena multiplayer shooters, the most important task for the player is SURVIVING as opposed to simply killing. Surviving and killing alike require a certain level of teamwork, since the game can be punishing for those who prefer to run and gun. This standard game formula is further broken down into pure Tug of War (where the map control starts with neutral center capture points and the control can go in either direction) and Assault/Defence (where one team attemps to capture the points accross a map while the other team must defend said points).  These modes are hardwired into the maps they are played on, meaning that some maps are soley Assault maps, while others are soley Tug of War maps. There are other game modes available, but I have not tinkered around with them much since I greatly enjoy the standard game as it is. Vehicular combat is a sore spot for me. Straight up, it sucks, for many reasons. Vehicle gameplay wasn't implemented in the normal fasion seen in most games. For example, you must commit to vehicular classes, and once spawned you actually start in the vehicle and cannot exit. Nor can other players enter your spawned vehicle. And there are other annoyances. It's just.... bad. Another gripe of mine is the spawn system: it's clunky and counter-intuitive. For example, if you are attempting to spawn on a squad leader, but the commander forces a respawn before you can finish the selection, you will spawn at a random spawn site that is most definately NOT your squad leader and more than likely much further from the front lines than you would like. Again, there are other annoyances with RO2s spawn system. All in all it is one of the premeire shooting experiences available. Highly recommended!			",116,23,0,18,15,0,34

												One of the most immersive WW2 or historical shooter on the market that offers interesting and dynamic gameplay. When you start playing it feels real fun, especally when you're in a tank with some friends and you're there yelling at each other. Definiently the pinnicle of multiplayer games.Also one of the best PTSD givers, sitting in a hole with your mates has never been so scary.			",59,0,0,4,4,0,5

												One of the most humbling games I have ever played. If you played CoD when it was fun (CoD 1-4) and are considering buying this game, be prepared for a shock. This game takes the realism and immersion of sims like Arma, but keeps you in the action by taking out the parts in Arma where you trek for miles with no idea where the enemy or your squad is, and focuses more on the action. Remember how in CoD your character, even on veteran, could soak up bullets like a sponge, red jelly seemingly leaking out of his eyeballs, then duck behind cover and ""squeeze"" out the damage he had taken moments before? Forget that. Forget the crosshair in the middle of your screen. Forget when you would pick up a PPSH in CoD 2, fire off the entire magazine at the same target with nary a spot of recoil to be seen. Forget the ability of your character to sprint through an artillery barrage, dash across a field while being sprayed with MG-42 fire, and take out a tank singehandedly with nothing but your trusty TNT without even flinching. Try anything of the sort in this game, and, assuming you aren't instantly torn apart, your screen's color will drain away, your heart will be pounding, and you will find aiming immpossible. And I don't mean just in the game. Each side, Axis and Allies, has its own strengths and weaknesses (although the Wermacht has few of the latter). Playing as the Soviet Union, unless you manage to snag one of the few special classes, such as sniper or commander, quickly turns into a meat-grinder experience, just as it would have been in real life. Playing as a rifleman, for example, will give you a Moison-Nagant 1895, two grenades and a life expectancy of about 30 seconds. You will charge across a field to a capture point which appears to be empty, and moments later a machine gun you never saw will open up from a window you forgot to check, or from behind a wall you passed without waiting for your team-mates to cover, and your brief, often pointless life will be over, as your squad members are often cut down around your darkening vision. Often a game spent as one of the more aggresive classes will turn in three steps: Spawn, die, repeat. Sometimes you will die without firing a shot. This may sound dull, painful, or frustrating. In your first online match you may not get more than one kill. The learning curve in this game is quite steep, and this discourages many people. But eventually you will begin to learn the quirks, tricks, and rewards of each class. If you are patient, cautious, and lucky, just as the real veterans of the battle of Stalingrad had to be, and you will improve. Your name will move up the scoreboard, and you will begin to reap the rewards of the time you invest a hundred times over. This is when the game becomes the most fun. You will unlock bayonets, scopes, and new guns, and your player model will begin to show the wear and tear of surviving the battles, with medals, extra ammo and camo. All in all, probably my favorite shooter of all time. The community is mature, and welcoming to new players. Stay away from the single player mode, and don't try the tank combat, and you will grow to love this beautiful, grim, and challenging video game.			",53,7,0,5,3,0,16

												Red Orchestra 2 is what filled the void when Call of Duty 2 multiplayer all but vanished into obscurity. Not just a straight replacement, but a move towards more realism and tactics and on a slightly larger scale. It was a bit of a leap, but well worth learning those extra controls. The weapons have weight to them, and the maps are fantastic. Very healthy multiplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game for free. Its okay. Nothing special. 90% of populated server run realism, so no hud so if you're new you're screwed, and everyone has most guns fully leveled or w/e and most servers limit classes so you're usually stuck in as a rifleman. It reminds me of COD 2 because the rifle play is good (but stuck as rifleman for map after map, isn't that fun after a while) and that game was fun, but its slow loading (UE3 isn't this slow but this game loads slow even on a nice rig) and limited servers makes it really hard to get into. I'd still buy it as its really one of the few that is a decent FPS now-a-days but I come from Arma, CoD, BF, CS, etc FPS's so if you havent played RO1 or dont like realism/hc all the time its probably not a great fit unless you want some challenge.7/10 ",150,3,5,28,39,1,36

												Welcome to the front, Hero !. Red Orchestra 2 Heroes of Stalingrad (And it's expansion Rising Storm) is a great game. Is a realistic WWII set in the eastern front in the battle of Stalingrad (Russians vs Germans), but when I say realistic, I mean REALISTIC. You can die from 1 shot in your body, and when you start playing you may never know who shot you or where you've been shot from.  You're not alone, up to 32 players per side battle each other with vehicles like the the famous Panzer 4. The unreal engine does a magnificent job in graphics, it is a good looking game and you'll need a high end machine to run it a maximum graphics. There are a lot of weapons in this game, though you'll need to pay the Risin Storm DLC to get access to all the other american and japanese classes, so you can only use rifleman until you pay (You have full access in the Germans vs Russians) You can customize your weapons when you level up, like a bayonet for the Kar 98k or the Mosin Nagant, a silencer for a revolver, etc.Overall, Red Orchestra 2 is a good game, but it has bugs and glitches that doesn't make it a perfect game, and the campaign is very weak, the missions are only battles with very poor A.I bots.  You shouldn't get this game for a singleplayer experience, because its strenght are the multiplayer matches.I recommend this game a lot, if you like WWII shooters, or realistic shooters, you should get this game and its expansion.

												This is another World War 2 First Person Shooter, but with a few key differences: it's set in the Eastern European Theatre, and you're not the badass mobile sentry you're regarded as in other FPS games.You don't hide behind cover, waiting for your Eagle-headed God to provide technical long-term immunity from lead poisoning. You don't just walk into the battlefield, explosions left and right, and expect everything to be sweet. You don't even have convenient vision overlays to tell you how many more steps to take until you win.Combat is vicious, it's the real deal. One bullet will either drop you on the spot or cause you a world of trouble before giving in to shock and blood loss. The level of detail is astonishing: projectiles are affected by ballistics and require both leading the target and sighting in/aiming higher.There are multiple classes available to play, each suited to specific roles: the Sharpshooter is given a scoped rifle to pick off high value targets like Commanders, who can send in airstrikes and lead teams, and Squad Leaders, who can use smoke grenades for covering their advance and work as mobile spawn points. You even have Tanks, but not in the revolutionary ""One-Crew"" format: you start with a Tank Commander, a Driver, a Cannon operator and a Loader. All are necessary for the tank to work well, otherwise you'll have to constantly switch seats, which takes time. Tank shells have believable physics as well, and can either punch through side/rear/top armor or deflect harmlessly.But all classes are heavily restricted, usually no more than 4 of them on most maps. The only general exception, the Rifleman, is both the cannon fodder and the most important asset of the team, much like Chess.Despite looking fairly drab and brown most of the time, the game looks very pretty - Scenery Gorn runs amok in the heavily bombed areas of Stalingrad. With a hellish warzone as this, what would you expect?The audio is amazingly immersive, for both good and bad. Native voice acting compliments this, in addition to giving you a good chance to not understand most of the chatter.Finally, your (many) inevitable deaths at the hands of other human players will be accompanied by gurgling of vital fluids, breathless gasps for one more lungful of air, or heart breaking cries from your stricken soldier to see their loved ones before expiring in a dirty trench. That is, if you're lucky enough not to get killed by an explosion, which tears off your limbs and leaves you a bloody mess screaming in pain.Stalingrad wasn't a victory for one side and defeat for the other.Stalingrad was a complete massacre for both sides. Thankfully, Heroes of Stalingrad is a very, very good multiplayer first person shooter set in the Eastern European Front of the Second World War.			",81,7,11,7,10,1,7

												Probably one of my all-time favourite FPS games that I've played to date.  Red Orchestra keeps bringing me back because it's a hardcore first-person shooter that requires skill, tactics and patience to achieve victory. Although a heavy team based game, your actions alone can determine whether your team lose or win; it is your choice on how you approach the enemy and defeat them.The best thing about Tripwire Interactive is that they don't create ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. No OP weapons, no OP glitches, no cheating/hacking. Just satisfying, hardcore gameplay. Definitely a must if you enjoy World War II, team based gameplay with a heavy involvement in tactics and team communication.			",100,17,6,7,23,0,17

												This game is really, really good, besides a few issues.Pros: -Tactical, gritty and definitely realistic, you will find yourself in a constant state of anticipation, not knowing if your next step will be your last, especially since the spawn is actually extremely broken (that part is a con) -Guns feel and sound absolutely amazing and powerful (M1 Garand unf) -No shortage of realism servers, as a matter of fact there are no casual servers in the server browser -Extremely unforgiving, you die in one or two shots. -Suspensful, and very fun to play. -A great sense of community and teamwork (A big plus!) -Maps are large, with a good balance between urban, open and close quarters combat. -Graphics are okay for a Unreal game.Cons: -Spawn is legitmately broken as ef u see kay -No, seriously, it's bad. -No spawn protection. -Not a very wide variety of weapons -Can give you shingles from stress -Really the only con with this game is the lack of playerbase and the spawn.I haven't played much RO to make a meaningful comparion, but it is a worthy successor overall. I highly suggest this game if you're tired of Call of Duty and Battlefield.			",98,8,1,6,9,1,14

												Red Orchestra in itself is a fairly niche game. It's got elements of more modern FPS shooters, mixed with some of its original hardcore difficulty. The mixture bodes well, in my opinion, and I've spent many hours playing this game and loving every minute. Honestly, one of my favorites in my library. If you're considering buying, it's well worth the investment.			",151,8,3,15,13,0,48

												RO2 raises the bar in multiplayer-based shooter realism. There will be no bunny hopping, 360 no scope headshots in this game, ever! It is an exercise in patience, a WW2 simulation where full auto weapons are in short supply, and bolt action rifles make up the bulk of the armaments. Iron sights are almost a requirement for accurate shooting, but a single shot can and often does make a kill. Realistic damage modeling rewards careful marksmanship, and treats a shot in the heart the same as a head shot... an instant kill. However, the effects of limb damage aren't made quite clear, and seem to serve no other purpose than a means to implement the self-applied battlefield bandaging feature.  RO2 is a PC-only shooter, and gives the arcadey big name console ports a run for their money. The standard gameplay mode is tug-of-war style where teams must grab control points in sequence. Each control point is captured via a ""King of the Hill"" style mini-tug-of-war by the team who can maintain a higher player count within the ""hill's"" borders. Thus, contrary to arena multiplayer shooters, the most important task for the player is SURVIVING as opposed to simply killing. Surviving and killing alike require a certain level of teamwork, since the game can be punishing for those who prefer to run and gun. This standard game formula is further broken down into pure Tug of War (where the map control starts with neutral center capture points and the control can go in either direction) and Assault/Defence (where one team attemps to capture the points accross a map while the other team must defend said points).  These modes are hardwired into the maps they are played on, meaning that some maps are soley Assault maps, while others are soley Tug of War maps. There are other game modes available, but I have not tinkered around with them much since I greatly enjoy the standard game as it is. Vehicular combat is a sore spot for me. Straight up, it sucks, for many reasons. Vehicle gameplay wasn't implemented in the normal fasion seen in most games. For example, you must commit to vehicular classes, and once spawned you actually start in the vehicle and cannot exit. Nor can other players enter your spawned vehicle. And there are other annoyances. It's just.... bad. Another gripe of mine is the spawn system: it's clunky and counter-intuitive. For example, if you are attempting to spawn on a squad leader, but the commander forces a respawn before you can finish the selection, you will spawn at a random spawn site that is most definately NOT your squad leader and more than likely much further from the front lines than you would like. Again, there are other annoyances with RO2s spawn system. All in all it is one of the premeire shooting experiences available. Highly recommended!			",116,23,0,18,15,0,34

												A true WW2 game. It´s all about tons of russians and their incredible numbers trying to overwhelm the germans. Elite Wehrmacht trying to shoot them all, mostly failing due to lack of ammunition they need to do so. Honorable japanese soldiers willing to die for the Emperor, constantly doing so in a banzai charge. And americans flaming the japenese to death and trying to not get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with a bayonet or chopped to pieces with a katana.P.S. If you play the campaign as the russians you´re going to get rekt by the elite german players. If you play the campaign as the japanese you´re screwed because of the superior american weaponry + flamethrower.It´s still a really great game offering a lot of tactical action and realistic experience. I really reccomend this game to anyone who likes FPS shooters with some challenge.			",73,2,0,4,1,0,13

												This game is really, really good, besides a few issues.Pros: -Tactical, gritty and definitely realistic, you will find yourself in a constant state of anticipation, not knowing if your next step will be your last, especially since the spawn is actually extremely broken (that part is a con) -Guns feel and sound absolutely amazing and powerful (M1 Garand unf) -No shortage of realism servers, as a matter of fact there are no casual servers in the server browser -Extremely unforgiving, you die in one or two shots. -Suspensful, and very fun to play. -A great sense of community and teamwork (A big plus!) -Maps are large, with a good balance between urban, open and close quarters combat. -Graphics are okay for a Unreal game.Cons: -Spawn is legitmately broken as ef u see kay -No, seriously, it's bad. -No spawn protection. -Not a very wide variety of weapons -Can give you shingles from stress -Really the only con with this game is the lack of playerbase and the spawn.I haven't played much RO to make a meaningful comparion, but it is a worthy successor overall. I highly suggest this game if you're tired of Call of Duty and Battlefield.			",98,8,1,6,9,1,14

You can hear their screams over the sound of the machine gun continuing to fire at the trench. You have 1 squad member left who tells you they're scared. You yell for them to follow you before a bullet passes through your skull. You didn't even make it out of the trench.			",51,2,0,3,12,0,22

Posted: February 22, 2014
												TL;DR The best tactical and WW2 FPS on the market. Realistic weapons, wide variety of maps, harsh and unforgiving, and the most authentic experience of the horrors of war in a video game.The main game (Red Orchestra 2), is set on the eastern front, and the expansion (Rising Storm), is set in the pacific theater. Weapons depend on which of these you play, but weapons can range from rifles like the M1 garand and Kar98k, to the M12 shotgun, to MGs like the mg42, to the BAR, and even to flamethowers, all made with precise detail of the original weapons. The main game, territory, consists of one attacking and defending team. Attackers cap points by getting men into different capzones, and defenders try to stop them. Reinforcements are simulated with respawns and each team has a limited amount of tickets (lives), and there is a time limit in each round. The maps can be huge, and they are very varied, requiring the use of flanking, smoke grenades, artillery, tank support, and aerial recons to play well enough to win. This game is very unforgiving, and you'll die alot at first, espicially if you play on the realistic, the recommended mode.There are various roles in the game, rifleman being your basic infantrymen, to roles like machine gunner and engineer, up to squad leaders and a commander, who issues out artillery and recons from a radio. All of these have their own details, so it's best to read up on how to play them, though riflemen is a good starting role. There are also vehicles, such as tanks and infantry trucks, available on some maps, these being the more larger maps. The damage model is harsh, one rifle shot to the chest usually being a one hit kill. The gunplay mechanics are very satisfying, there being bullet drop and different parts of the body that can be damaged. There are no special skins or perks here, nearly all weapons using the good old ironsights. Gameplay is usually slow, as rushing into a point will just get you killed, even if you have an smg at hand. Careful waves of attack, and setting up a good defence are crucial.One thing done really well in this game is to show the horrors of war. This game is very gory, including dismemberment from things like explosives. Heavy fire or artillery will make your game shake and go grey, as if suppressed. There are the screams of pain from your fellow soldiers, wishing to be somewhere else. There are some pretty harsh and even racist taunts that can be spoken, adding to the realism of the game. This game is really good at showing both sides as human, instead of the usual bad guys vs good guys, this being army vs army, nothing more.  The community itself is generally of a good level whilst playing, and it's easy enough playing in a squad on your own if friends aren't available. I've had my fair share of interesting occasions, like someone spamming Rick Astley's ""Never gonna give you up"", people ""roleplaying"" as soldiers of their respective teams, and a hacker who somehow kicked every singe person from a server, but instead of being shown a kick message, it said that you were banned. Of course, I wasn't banned, and this person did not do this again, at least not to me.One thing this game does well is keep you playing. I've played more than 50 hours, and I feel like I've only scratched the surface of this game in terms of roles and tactics. This game will take a very long time to become truly good at it, or even master it.Overall, one of the best Tactical FPS out there, and a must buy.			",153,20,0,26,17,2,24

												This game is just masterpiece to me, over 100 hours played i can say i know this game pretty well. At first Red Orchestra/Rising storm isnť arcade shooter like Battlefield or Call of Duty so donť even try to compare it! This game is very realistic like bullet drops, so you must aim higher...Hitbox system is very good also. To sound...its great..When you hear bullets fizzling near your head + artillery around you it is very depressing and it feels like you are actually in the trenches with you squad.The core of the game though is teamwork (you can use voice commands or VOIP), with a good server and good players you move in squads, coordinate flanking assaults with artillery strikes and charge through your squad leaders smoke cover to overwhelm the opposition! Maps are very well designed and realistic. You can choose from many different classes to play like Engineer, Rifle man, Squad leader and more...Iam not huge fan of Unreal Engine 3 so graphic is little negative for me...So as bugs are and you will find many of them, but they donť destroy gameplay so much and you can actually enjoy the game.The combat is fierce and filled with mayhem. What's amazing is that for all the chaos of the battlefield the game remains cogent, balanced and the deep strategical gameplay remains intact. Game contains different mods to play..and also different 	difficulty - Classic, Arcade, Realistic so for new players in this genre is great way how to learn something about this game. Did i mention there is Steam Workshop for this game? Yeah awesome, now there are pretty cool addons, mod and maps from commuity..Shoutout to them :)I rate 8/10.See you on battlefield comrades!

												this game is simply an amazing war simulatorforget those casual shooters, this game is the real deal!it features realistic combat, great soundtrack, actual feel wether you're russian or German (Russian Hurrah charge for the win)it also features a funny morale system where if your soldier sees one of their comrades die brutally, they loose morale for a while and the screen becomes a bit darker for a little whiel because you are loosing your mind when seeing your comrades slaughtered or if you're udner heavy artillery fire this game teaches players the truth: Soldiers are survivors, Not a bunch of Rambos running around with customized weapons			",37,1,0,2,1,0,0

												Well this takes me back a bit. Georgy Zhukov was at the heaad of the Russian attack when Meine Fuhrer launched operation Barbarosa. What a splended day this was.Damn Russikies constantly shouting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' everytime we rolled through there mud huts and straw houses - they really are far behind the Nazie regime. Not much to report home on from my time in Stalingrad, except they fight like rats. Cowards and most of them Traitors - watch out for the Snipers on some of the maps here though, there camping and picking people off is incredibly boring and takes the most patient of campers to carry on.There seems to be no ballistics on this too - one of my soldiers had reportedly killed 5 - yes 5 Russian Infantry from 265 Metres away WITH AN MP40. Have to say, i believe this - German precision Engineering and all. if you like to hide in grass or tall bushes - this is the game for you, unfortunately for some of my soldiers, there were no tall grass or bushes to hide in - just snow and rubble. Fight hard for the Fuhrer - defend against the monstrous might of the Red Army - kill the Russians! Kill them all! Take particular pleasure in killing the campers my fellow Nazi soldiers!

												so for me this has been one of the most enjoyable FPS set in the ww2 that i have ever played. this game combiens hte Arms and maps of 1940 etc.One of the things i like the most is that its very realistic and then i belive that then you can´t complain about OPness anymore, since clearly you did soemthign worng and it got you killed So instead of complaning just train and you will see that it will go smother.one really thing you can really complain about is hte Ai being ridicoulsly stupid and sometimes it feels like the Ai is cheating. the other thing is the Community being so toxic everybody is complaning on you etc if you do something acroding to them ""wrong"". but don´t mind that normaly 5 tiems out of teen you will have good experince.i am giving this game a 8/10 as a finall score			",46,1,0,5,8,0,8

												Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad with the paid DLC Rising Storm.  If you like World War 2 themed PVP first person shooter simulations, this is a good game to get.  This game is slightly less realistic than the original Red Orchestra, but the graphics and the gameplay is whole lot better.  The single player is WW2 combat like the original Call of Duty and Medal of Honor games.  Comes with a separate Singleplayer campaign game.You can play as infantry or tanker only.  The tank combat here is better than the original Red Orchestra, because the tank crew bots listen to your detailed comands that you can give, and you have more viewports to use.  The tanks models looks limited to the Panzer 4 and T-34 in the few original tank using maps.  As Commander, you can issue useful commands to your teammates. Server Maps can have AI bots filling out the team roster.  You can command the bots squads to take objectives, defend objectives, or go to locations but not give artillery targets.  The bots are slightly more smarter, and have better shooting skills but still no substitute for real players.   RO2 multiplayer servers are German vs Russian maps.  With the Rising Storm DLC you have access to Japan vs American maps, (Using the Flamethrower is fun).  Has great multiplayer maps and a single person campaign.  A lot of multiplayer servers have bots filling in for real players.The single player campaigns are German vs Russian or Russian vs German, it is a separate game bundled with your purchase.  The single player game is sort of buggy and cheats.  You can also use console comands in the single player game to complete the achievements there.Has Steam Achievements with badge trading cards. Has Steam Workshop with modding community making new maps using the included Level Editor.for more info:

												My favorite game on Steam. I've put countless hours into this game and will continue to do so until it's no longer supported. I grew up with WW2 games such as Medal of Honor and Call of Duty, as well as an online FPS game called ""D-Day Normandy"" and at times I played Wolfenstein FPS games. This game is a mix of all of those. The most popular mode is a realistic gameplay style of campaign, which is perfect for anyone who likes a realistic war experience.			",21,1,0,3,0,0,0

												A true WW2 game. It´s all about tons of russians and their incredible numbers trying to overwhelm the germans. Elite Wehrmacht trying to shoot them all, mostly failing due to lack of ammunition they need to do so. Honorable japanese soldiers willing to die for the Emperor, constantly doing so in a banzai charge. And americans flaming the japenese to death and trying to not get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with a bayonet or chopped to pieces with a katana.P.S. If you play the campaign as the russians you´re going to get rekt by the elite german players. If you play the campaign as the japanese you´re screwed because of the superior american weaponry + flamethrower.It´s still a really great game offering a lot of tactical action and realistic experience. I really reccomend this game to anyone who likes FPS shooters with some challenge.			",73,2,0,4,1,0,13

												Call Of Cuty is a game for children. This is a game for men. COD kids get out.This is my favorite WW2 game by far. This a great and realistic game with a lot of depth.Here is a quick overview:You will play as a soldier of either the Red Army, the Wehrmacht, The U.S. Marines, or the Imperial Japanese Army. The game is set in two theaters of war, The Pacific (U.S. Vs Japs), and the Eastern front (Russians Vs Germans). In each army, there are different classes such as rifleman, assault, marksman, and so on. As you progress in the game, your weapons will level up and get attachments/upgrades, and look like they are in better condition. The class you are playing itself can be leveled up to give you more weapon/sidearm choices. Finally, you can level up your account with ""Honor"". The higher that level is, the more battle hardened your soldier is and the more things overall you can choose from. I recommend you play the training missions, and I partially put that here so I wouldn't have to type anymore stuff...In any case, I rate this game 10/10. ",50,9,1,12,13,0,8

												This game is really cool if you like lying behind some cover with a mounted MG shooting the crap into Russians.You can be on the Russian side or the German side, they are both pretty cool, for the Russians, you get a PPSH with other rifles like the Mosin-Nagnant, snipers etc, for the Germans, you get MP40's, MG's, snipers, rifles and so on.I would also recommend getting the Rising Storm, as you can be a Japanese soldier or an American soldier. The Japanese get the have Katanas and the Americans get the have flamethrowers which is a pretty fun boost from Red Orchestra 2.The graphics are a bit outdated, maybe similar to Call of Duty: World at War, but it is still better than that game. Also, if you have a screen resolution of 1360 x 768 like myself, you'll have to play the game in a windowed mode because of the screen resolution being stretched etc.The modes are also really good because you can go to 'Realism Mode' which is like 1 bullet death, so it's realistic. (unlike COD)Seriously, get Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad, even if you haven't seen it because you will not be disappointed.			",60,5,0,5,5,0,5

This game is hard, nerve-wracking, and not for the faint of heart or anyone who is used to 1337 720ºNoscopesnipah kills.This game encourages camping.This game is like a severe parent punishing your every mistake.This game is absolutely, bloody good. Get it if you can. Play it if you have the time. I know I only clocked around 20 hours on it, but I would play the hell out of it if I could.So, let us get serious. Hardcore shooter with cover mechanics. Somewhat glitchy, too, but I don't find it unplayable by any means. Servers are typically 32 vs 32, with bots usually filling any slots left (which gives both teams an impressive amount of cannon fodder), so you know the battles are going to be big. Weapons lack variety, which is to be expected considering it aims to be a realistic, historically-accurate game. And, bear with me here, said weapons are unbalanced. Remember COD 2? A semi-auto rifle will never, or hardly ever, one-hit kill, which is understandable for gameplay reasons. Cue Red Orchestra's Elite Rifleman class, armed with a semi-auto rifle: it has the same power as the humble breech-loading basic rifles, but is semi-auto and holds more ammo. Then again, it's limited to, say, 3 per team. Same happens with the LMG, with astonishing firepower, or the SMGs, which can make mincemeat of anything at close to medium ranges. However, this not only means that there are, naturally, players better equipped. Those same players have responsibilities: take a marksman rifle and go lone wolf scoring random kills? Wrong. Use it to clear the way for a capture point, to find the machine gunner who is tearing your team apart. Squad leader? Stay alive to allow respawning on you, make judicious use of your smoke grenades. So on and so on. Teamplay is king. Armies win wars. The cover system works well. You can sprint crouched. Grenades can be gently dropped instead of having to throw them at the ceiling hoping they stay in the damned room. Gunplay is smooth, graphics are really good, sound and effects immersive as it gets. What more is there to ask for?Ah, yes. Satisfaction. The satisfaction of out-aiming an enemy 120 metres away. Looking at the top right corner, those seconds lying in wait, thinking ""Did I get him?"". Then you see it. You hit him spot on, you got the kill. You may get pistol-whipped to death a second after, but getting a kill in Red Orchestra is as satisfying as it gets in a shooter. Of course, there are shortcomings. Optimization is poor. Some glitches can get a bit annoying. As I said, weapon variety is low and you may get relegated to basic Rifleman for rounds on end. You will get frustrated. The game is punishingly hard. But in the end, this is a top-notch shooter. Go get it. Go get 'em.			",209,29,7,35,19,1,42

So all COD players are playing COD but all the great people are here sitting in trenches or dying to sniper fire. Also be sure that you are buying the Rising Storm GOTY and not the Red Orchestra 2.

												One of my favorite fps games of all time.It offers a good amount of realism.Not to much so its for die hard super realism players and enough to say its not an ordinary fps.The thing that makes it diffrent from games like cod and bf4 is that you die way easier one good bullet is all it takes and the ranges are around 30 m for close range and 100 to 250 m for long distance fight.In every team there are several diffrent roles to take.The basic is the rifelman the most basic , besides that there are squad leaders who act like mobile spawn point mg gunners sniper anti tank units and tank crews and commander (whos role is to deploy arty on the enemy using the spots given by the squad leaders.Overall i like it and recommend it to any lover of the ww2 era of weapons and tactics			",48,2,3,3,3,0,10

												A solid World War II experience with many realistic aspects such as bullet range calibration for different firearms and vehicles, bleeding out unless bandaged, and a large bundle of war-torn maps as one would expect from when the war was at it's worst. A great multiplayer system, hosting is simple and joining is simpler than it was in the first game, maps support up to 64 players total, allowing for 32 players on each side playing as either the Axis or Allied forces.Overall, this game gets a score of 8/10 due to a somewhat flonky controll system and the occational framerate and bug issues. Some aspects in the game should've been more polished such as the cover mechanics and bullet damage. (The hardcore mode fixes this to some extent, although it still lingers with some firearms).

												This game is like a ragged teddy bear for me. It's not off the shelf new, it has its bugs, its TKrs, hackers on the private servers and so on. But you know what? I really love this game. I've probably rewrote this review 3 or 4 times by now trying to say exactly why. I think, this time, I've figured it out; It's the moments.     To explain what I mean, I'll give some examples and then you're going to buy this game, make your own experiences, and understand the feeling I get remembering each of these. Experience 1: I was a rifleman in squad two, German side and attacking. We were holding out in a barn, surrounded by swirling snow and the crack of bullets going supersonic as they whistled towards us from seemingly everywhere. It was hectic, but we were holding. All of a sudden, something flew in the window where the Squad Leader and two others were standing. I looked, saw and bellyflopped on the grenade. After a split second, I heard a whump and I died. However, the others were unharmed and held the area until the rest of us mopped up and began covering them.Experience 2: We were on the beaches. I was in command of the American attack and we were getting slaughtered 30 seconds in due to the entire enemy team digging in at the center trenches overlooking our spawn. I considered the situation and ordered Squad Leaders 2 and 3 to get me spotted marks on those trenches. Number 3 was shot but 2 managed to get a perfect mark, ordering his squad forward to provide him just enough cover. That was all I needed, I ordered everyone to make ready just outside the trenches and called in hell. Three salvos of molten lead from the sky later, and all but two of the enemy team were dead and I ordered the advance. They charged in through the smoke, myself with them. Spraying fire and death, we repeated this all the way to the end, never giving them enough time to settle and hold.Experience 3: My Comrades and I were running down a muddy track, rushing to get to the front. The Fritz were attacking us on our hill position and those bunkers are pretty much our only cover. Machine gunner? I don't know but one of us just hit the dirt and he isn't moving. Two more dead. My vision just went gray and blurred. There's a ringing in my ears. Grenade, Three more dead. That's okay I think, we still have five more of us. Yes, we made it, bunker, safety. I'm catching my breath and three explosions go off in the bunker, stunning me. I can't see much, the last thing I had clear sight of was the guy nearest me flying. My vision is clear, oh no. Blood everywhere, bodies, limbs. Everyone is dead. I can hear the Nazis shouting orders and egging each other on. Can I make it out the door and retreat to the line? Too late, they saw me I raise my rifle and all goes black as I get shot in the back by another one of them.There are very few games where I can get stories such as these and many more. The learning curve is tight. You will die many, many, many, many times. It's worth it, without a doubt in my mind. The last thing that I reccomend is playing this game in realism mode. It's not 100 percent realism, however it's enough to actually feel the tension instead of a more arcade, Call of Duty/ Battlefield level of gameplay. After reading all of this, you think you have the patience to get what I get, and maybe even more, out of Red Orchestra 2, I have only one question. Why are you still reading this?

												Absolutely stunning. The graphics quality is superb, and the gameplay is far better than the first. RO2's gameplay has been dumbed down ever so slightly from the first game in order to achieve far superior playability and noob-friendliness than the first RO without sacrifizing realism. The maps and gamemodes are intense and the focus on team-based efforts and communication make the experience really come alive. I recommend this to anyone who is serious about shooters.

												Where do I start with Red Orchestra 2? When I first got this game, I had no idea what I was in for. I loaded up a match, chose my class and charged headlong into the fight, just like I would any other fps. That was a horrible mistake. I was shot once and bled out about five feet from the spawn. My first few matches went a lot like this one. Eventually, I learned how to survive long enough to get to the objectives and that's when I discovered how truly brutal this game can be. There's nothing more intense than being trapped on the second floor of a bombed out building with german troops rushing in and all you have is a bolt-action rifle that's low on ammo so you're forced to hide and beat them to death one by one. This and many other moments are what make this game one of my all time favorites. Nothing else compares. Play it and see for yourself.			",145,11,0,12,11,1,29

												The most realistic first person shooter I've ever played. Quite the learning curve I find but once you get the hang of it, this can be one awesome game. Gravity has effect on the bullets, but you can adjust sights to compensate for distance, you can rest your rifle against a window sill or door ledge to stable your firearm for accuracy, controls inside the tanks are in view, and there's effects for when you're under suppressive fire. You can also level up classes and firearms to become more efficient. Not terribly unlike real life, after all you can condition yourself to have better stamina, get more in tune with the firearms you own, and you can also get attachments/modifications for some. Hoping that in Red Orchestra 3, they incorporate the possibility of jams. In real life however, if you maintain your firearms, malfunctions will be few and far between. No gun is 100% reliable, though. Not even AKs or Glocks.June 23, 2014 - Since an update they made in April, I have been unable to play the game, and many others have also been unable to join servers. Do not waste your money on RO2 or RS until it starts working again, it will only give you headaches.Nov 24, 2014 - The issue seems to have been resolved, the game is running well again. Enjoy the WWII realism!			",153,35,0,16,10,0,17

												This game is better in my opinion but surely the shooting at a person or enemy is reallistech  because  when ever you shoot  with a rifle or LMG the person will die as in real life. Ammo is scarce in this so think befor you pull the trigger and ricoil is real on a sub-machine and LMG fire brust mode with a sub-machinegun. But they should put in a LAN multiplayer mod in this game. I am having difficulties of downloading the LAN server for this game.			",39,2,0,2,5,0,11

												I gotta say, im not even through training and I can assure as far as amazing realism goes, this game has it. 4 people are needed to drive a tank, not 1, tanks have ammoYou can check gun clips, all reload types are accurate to period guns, you have to change the barrels on mg42's the same way the krauts did, you can blind fire. You can modify the range on scopes and iron sights, bullets have drop. You can use Anti Tank rifles though you have to, as they did in reality, aim for weak spots. The ""Commander"" class is an actual soldier in a bunker who uses a radio to call in strikes, and can look outside to mark targetsThis game gives you much more freedom than other FPS games, this is where the game stops holding your hand, meaning you are going to have to grow up and learn to take cover, learn to use your senses and some common sense, and learn to work as a team if you want to stay alive.but on the flipside, this extra responsibility comes with so damn much freedom..Alot of the reviews that seem to list battles out are a bit fluffed, but not by much. Getting hit in certain parts does affect your soldier in different ways, you can melee charge with everyone (Except the US I think) You can look out the hatch of a tank if you dont mind getting your head blown off by a sniper, you can shell buildings into dust. You can kill your team mates, i dont think theres anywhere FF is not on.This is a grown ups First person shooter, another of those ""War simulator"" games that are setting a trend taking us away from call of duty and battlefield. Hero's in red orchestra are people who stay with the team, take care of their men, and stay alive, not that moron who is running across an open field with his pistol and gets shot through the chest, falling to his knees and slowly bleeding out as he asks why the stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥he used in all the other FPS games isnt working here.EDIT:Finally had my first battle, and the truth is, alot of those epica moments people list? they happen. Hell, i went on a bot server for my first since i didnt want to drag down the team as the new guy, and even then I came out with a war story. Please note, im not adding much flourish at all and this did happen within an hour of starting normal gameplay WITH BOTS. Also, listen to it in Artyom's voice from metro! The Nazis were fighting in the lower floor of the grain silo, i hee-ad been snai-ping (Gotta get that Russian Accent in there) on the therd floore, when i heard the screams of my comrahds bee-lowh. I took my trusty nagant revolver, and despite being a snai-per I ran to their aid. Upon coming in I saw my position and entry were foolish, 3 nazis, 2 with rif-els and one with a macheen-gun stood looking at me, i quickly took cover by a pill-are and aimed, firing immediately, I heard the metallic think of a peer-ced helmet, and the first nazi fell, staring at the hole in his head. I quickly turned the corner on my pill-ar and took a shot at the gunner, heering the same metallic Thood, he too fell to the ground, the last one stood, as if in shock at my markshmanship, and i then took his life, the shot hitting him in the throat, he fell over and gurgled slowly to death on his own blood. I sat, shocked by my own survival for a moment, before returning to reality and picking up the german's macheengun, the enemy was not finished with me, i mounted the heavy gun on the sandbags facing the entrance to the silo and prepared myself...Many more germans had to go to hell on this day, and I was just getting started			",243,24,0,11,10,2,5

												Red Orchestra and Rising Storm are truly amazing WW2 tactical shooters. Very realistic and challenging gameplay with no room for silly mistakes. Player can take a role of one of few different infantry classes (like rifleman, team leader, sniper, tank hunter etc. ) and also can be a part of a tank crew. German Panzer IV and soviet T-34 are very good addition in the game and both are very well modelled and detailed. Weapons behaviour is very realistic and weapon ballistics/accurace is also well executed. Rising Storm will take the player to the Pacific Ocean theatre of WW2.US Army and Imperial Army are extremely well done. Using US superior firepower to take stategic locations in places like Iwo Jima or Saipan is a great experience.In my opinion the thing that makes this game so great is definitely the Japanesse Imperial Army. They do not posses such good equipment as US forces, but they rely on their unmatched feriocity and fanatical determination to fight to the last man. Booby traps, ambushes and other treacherous tactics are in common use. Watching an entire squad rushing into enemy position with swords/bayonets/grenades and fanatical screams is something that could not be forgot - Banzai Charge is an unique gameplay mechanic of the Imperial Army.

												Absolutely stunning. The graphics quality is superb, and the gameplay is far better than the first. RO2's gameplay has been dumbed down ever so slightly from the first game in order to achieve far superior playability and noob-friendliness than the first RO without sacrifizing realism. The maps and gamemodes are intense and the focus on team-based efforts and communication make the experience really come alive. I recommend this to anyone who is serious about shooters.

												So, after playing the multiplayer of both Rising Storm & Red Orchestra 2 for about 170+ hours and reaching max level on Rising Storm while also reaching a decently high level on Red Orchestra 2, I can say that this game is excellent.The game is extremely unforgiving, you often die in pretty much 1 or 2 hits. If you are hit anywhere but your limbs, you'll probably die instantly. The only times you really have a chance to survive is if a bullet hits your arm or leg. If you somehow don't die instantly and you're wounded, you can use one of the 2 bandages you are given every spawn to patch yourself up. If you do not bandage up in time, you might bleed out depending on where you got shot. It is very important to move carefully by going from cover to cover and checking your corners.I really like the fact that there's a max player limit per class, for example, there are only allowed to be a set amount of ""Assault class"" players, same goes for machine gunner, marksman, squad leader etc... The only class that is really never full is rifleman. Which makes sense, obviously.It feels extremely satisfying to fire a round into someone, the enemies often drops quite realistically which makes for an immersive experience, the suppression is also done just right in my opinion. It fits the game perfectly. It really starts to mess with your aim when you're supressed, your aim will be completely thrown off if you are suppressed by full auto fire of an MG.The game requires a great amount of teamwork, if you want to succeed you are going to have to work together with your squad leaders and your commander. It is very important for squad leaders to stay alive as they serve as spawn points for other players within their squad. Squad leaders also have to mark locations for artillery, and they are also equipped with smoke grenades which are good for helping your team push up. The commander has the most important role in the team, he or she must give orders to the other squad leaders and fireteams and is also capable of calling in artillery on the locations marked by the squad leaders.  Communication is very important in this game, if you have an important role at least.The graphics are also pretty good for a 2011 game, it runs on Unreal Engine 3 and the art style overall is fairly appealing. The gun models look great and the first person animations are nicely done. Texture work is mostly good, models look really nice, effects (like smoke, fire) look very good, too.I must warn you though, this game has an insanely big learning curve. If you are not used to these types of games I can almost guarantee you it'll be very difficult for you to do well. It took me quite some time to get good at the game.Framerate wise, it varies. Some maps are better optimized than others, though overall performance does seem good.All in all, if you want a fairly realistic and unforgiving world war 2 shooter, then this is for you.Oh and one more thing, don't play the singleplayer campaign. Just don't.			",196,16,1,15,10,1,8

												Red Orchestra 2 is an FPS game set during World War II and more precisely during the conquer of Stalingrad by the German army: during the single player campaign we will play first as a German soldier on the attacking side and then as a Russian soldier and his team who has to defend various location in Stalingrad from the German attack. Overall the story and the story-telling are good, but the low performance optimization, the bad A.I. and a bunch of bugs really make the singleplayer experience worse than it should be.On the multiplayer side this game really shines, all the problems of the singleplayer were fixed, good graphics and performance, less bugs and good A.I. The tactical and realistic style that this game has is really hard to find in other videogames, i can only compare it to a mix of Arma and BattleField mechanics: lots of different classes with actually different roles, vehicles, covers, medium/large-sized maps (but smaller then Arma or BF), character and weapons experience levels and a realistic game mode in which you die with a single rifle shot or a small assault rifle burst.At the beginning the game can look hard and not appealing but once you get to know the basics and the mechanics you will start to love it: for this i suggest everyone to play the campaign first, even if it's the worse part of the game, that will help you enjoy the multiplayer.In less words, BUY IT.

												DayZ indoctrinated me to the realistic shooters out there. Red Orchestra 2, while not as robust as the ArmA series, has nailed so many aspects of the gritty, unprejudiced realities of war that these soldiers had gone through. Machine guns prey on on potentially dozens of enemies if caught unaware. The sheer imbalance of close quarters and the impractibility of being in the open for even short amounts of time prove how fragile your life is. Squad tactics become important and smoke grenades, explosives, and covering fire become essential when taking objectives. Artillery can wipe out nearly all the members of a team in just once strike and seeminly good cover can prove fatal when a stray bullet pierces your helmet. When one life is so meaningless you cherish it for some reason, nobody wants to be the one to cross the machine gun nest's field of vision, or the sniper that is watching for your slightest mistake. Your life becomes valuable despite it seemingly not being so. Your participation in capturing objectives can make or break a game, however. Teamwork and leadership wins the majority of games through good squad leaders and a good team leader. Red Orchestra 2 is a realism shooter for the hardcore, but is accessible to anyone just looking for an intense, but good time. Its not perfect. Certain angles with the prone system are abused, but this is very, very rare. Sometimes the cover system in the game messes with your ability to bandage yourself (they share a key) and you die a needless death. This is slightly less rare, but it doesn't happen often. Also against players the cover system is rarely worth it. Exiting cover in the system to shoot is often a sure way to die quickly as you expose an awful lot of your body while doing so. Melee combat is often not perfect and for some reason servers that display 50 ping in the browser sometimes gives everyone 200 ping in game. These are all very minor, however, and do not affect the game much. Its certainly less annoying than certain things in Call of Duty, Battlefield, and ArmA. Counter Strike Source (or GO) is much more polished but that is a very different game so I wouldn't compare the two.Rising Storm, the standalone expansion (you dont need the base game to play) is like a whole new game. The large, open areas and bombed out ruins of the Eastern Front are replaced with the dense jungle of the Pacific Isles and despite some similar sized maps, the battles are closer and even more intense. It becomes even more brutal despite the absence of tanks as it becomes very clear, very quickly, the Japanese forces are at a disadvantage. The force multiplier the Allies rely on are provided by larger machine gun belts, semi-automatic rifles, powerful sub-machine guns and support weapons, and flamethrowers that can take out entire squads with a bursting swath of fiery death. This forces Japanese to abuse their mechanics of knee-mortars and banzai charges or overwhelmingly lose any given match. Often, banzai charges make the difference between a win and a loss in a match and melee combat is a much more common occurance than in RO2:HoS, further amplifying the brutality of the close quarters, unfair, Pacific Front.Together you have two amazing takes on war that doesn't feed on its own ridiculousness or cheesy one-off matches of quick entertainment. The campaign system gives some meaning to playing on your favorite servers with your favorite communities and following the lead of a good squad leader (while contributing) is a sure way to make some fast friends. The community is very mature as kids tend to avoid the difficult learning curve of the game but once you get into it, learn the maps, the guns, and the basics of realism, it will really grow on you. Listen to the veterans and you'll stay alive.			",222,32,3,27,22,4,45

												It was December 1942, I was ordered by high command to assault the railway station we lost to the Nazis. My fellow comrades, nervous in the cold looked to me for inspiration. When the command was given, my men launched the offensive. Pushing and pushing, countless lives we lost on both sides. Finally after a brutal battle we retook the station and stopping for a single day, we continued towards the Russian front.Excerpts from Lt.

												-Excellent gameplay if you enjoy realism and team cooperation in a WWII FPS-One bullet is enough to kill you on most parts of the body, otherwise you're probably going to need to bandage your wounds. Bandages are scarce.-Good cover system, similar to Call of Juarez's allowing you to aim where you wish over or around cover. I don't use it too much honestly.-Suppression system: If you keep fire on an enemy position (even just firing over them, not necessarily hitting them) they will not be able to move or fire back.-Slightly annoying-to-use squad/command system, which is neglected by players a lot unfortunately-Very good acoustics(?) on the weapons. As you move to or from a source of gunfire you can hear the change in sound. At a distance of a few hundred metres it sounds as though it could just be ambient (non-player controlled) noise recorded at a shooting range, which is nice.-Great voice acting, unfortunately there are only two different voices per team. That isn't much of a problem anyway, they don't get stale.-Decent music, although it's only ambient.-Extremely good tank gameplay, especially if you're coordinating with a friend(s). I haven't used the Soviet T-34s, but there are 4 positions in the Panzer IV which can either be operated all by one person, or as a group with other players. There's only one tank-only map I've played so far, which I thought there should be more of.-Lastly, due to a combination of a few previously mentioned things (acoustics, music, gameplay, voice-acting), the environment is one of the things I like most aside from gameplay. On most maps it's very gloomy and dark, with massive barrages of artillery and dog-fights overhead. This combined with the dreary layout of the map (abandoned buildings, train-lines, trenches, etc.), ambient music and constant gunshots makes Stalingrad feel like Stalingrad.-Rising Storm is mediocre, not many people playing it in Australia either.Not a whole lot of negatives to the game, movement and some other actions can feel a bit clunky at times. There is a losing bias to the Axis I've noticed recently, I have a win/loss ratio of 0.08 (~80 wins, ~900 losses), yet a kill/death ratio of 1.1 (not implying that's a good ratio, just that it's not terribly [game-losingly] bad). I'm not sure whether this is due to the Axis being inherently underpowered, or veteran players always choosing to play as the Allies. I'd therefore recommend sticking to the Allies if you're new.

												Red Orchestra 2 is an FPS game set during World War II and more precisely during the conquer of Stalingrad by the German army: during the single player campaign we will play first as a German soldier on the attacking side and then as a Russian soldier and his team who has to defend various location in Stalingrad from the German attack. Overall the story and the story-telling are good, but the low performance optimization, the bad A.I. and a bunch of bugs really make the singleplayer experience worse than it should be.On the multiplayer side this game really shines, all the problems of the singleplayer were fixed, good graphics and performance, less bugs and good A.I. The tactical and realistic style that this game has is really hard to find in other videogames, i can only compare it to a mix of Arma and BattleField mechanics: lots of different classes with actually different roles, vehicles, covers, medium/large-sized maps (but smaller then Arma or BF), character and weapons experience levels and a realistic game mode in which you die with a single rifle shot or a small assault rifle burst.At the beginning the game can look hard and not appealing but once you get to know the basics and the mechanics you will start to love it: for this i suggest everyone to play the campaign first, even if it's the worse part of the game, that will help you enjoy the multiplayer.In less words, BUY IT.

In RO2 you can kill enemies with single shots, or just wound them and let them bleed out.

												Best WW2 First Person Tactical Shooter i have ever played.Its Very Realistic.You die after an or a few hits and if you lucky and survive a shot you need to care about the wound quick.You only have a HUD if you display it with an key,it shows your tacital game information,such as actual targets and how far away it is and where the next supplly crate or radio is.Friendly Player names go away after an distance from like 20 meters which force you need to look before shoot.You have no ammunition display about your current ammo in the mag,you know how many mags you have left and if you want to check how much is left in the mag you need to check it for real which makes you defenseless for some seconds.Limited numbers of specific soldiers like sniper or mg gunner per team so you havent an sniper spam for example.Tank crews can get the actual full crew of players which need to work as an team.Its giving the unique moments which you have like ""Only in Battlefield"" in BF3 and BF4.Many More Unique and Realistic Features!You need to like this sort of games to enjoy it fully.I Recommend it to everyone who likes realistic games,ww2 games and games which you need to get into.

												Most realistic FPS I've ever played.  Weapons have weight, you don't recover health when you get shot (If you get shot in shot in the hand, there is a bullet wound in that hand until you die or you win), most detailed Panzer IV/T-34s I've ever seen in games, bullet travel time, half the guns are one or two-hit kills, supression mechanics, most combat (Except urban combat) takes place at 50-150 meters, so you have to have some kind of accuracy to survive and conquer, the combat tends to be realistically short and terrifying, you have an extremely minimalist HuD, you have no ammo counter, no crosshairs, your guns sway from side to side as you walk/run with them... I could go on for pages, but I'll stop here. Highly recommended if you want a realistic experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You actually have to look through the scope rather than it taking up all the space on the screen.5. Multiple Roles. Play as infantry, or a Tank commander, Or a general, Or….you get my meaning.6.

												The one thing this game goes for is Realism. They go for that out the gate, and they go for it hard. most people play on Realism, and what this does is mean... you take a rifle shot to the chest, you die. Do not go into this game thinking it'll be like Call of Duty. Do not go into this game thinking it'll be like Battlefield. You play smart. You use cover. You do NOT run out into the open cause as I said, 1-2 bullets... you will die. It feels like real battles. Sounds fill the battlefield making it come alive. Boots on floorboards. Whistles of artillery. And the soldiers, man do they talk! Every little detail, even randomly asking the guy next to you you're waiting with if he's doing alright. The one of two drawbacks though, is with realism, some matches tend to have nametags of any kind turned off. This goes for allies. So the first thing you'll become frustrated with is trying to figure out who's friend or foe. You will shoot allies. You will get shot by allies. It happens, it's annoying. Some games however, have nametags turned on for allies when you look in their direction. This, helps, A LOT! The other major drawback, is after a few rounds... it gets repeatative. You'll find yourself playing against bots more often then players just so you can grind Honor levels and weapon ranks since you get the same experience killing bots then you do players.It's a cheap buy, and if you want more realism in your shooters, then check the game out.

												Great game, I love how Tripwire have kept a realistic feel without comprimising on fun, hectic largescale battles.MULTIPLAYER:At first the game can seem quite overwhelming and the ranking system is hard to grasp.There are three types of ranking in the game: honour, class and weapon. Just by playing the game you will recieve XP and you will rank up in the traditional way of gaining enough XP, then increasing in level. Then there is class ranking; the more you play a particular class, the class will gain ranks (there are three class ranks). Each rank in a particular class may give you a new weapon, but will make the character look more 'battle hardened'. Then there is weapon ranking, at level 0 your weapon will have no attachments, no perks and will be completely stock in terms of upgrades. When you reach level 25 just by playing with it, you may(or may not) gain an attachement for your weapon e.g. a bayonet. Also your weapon handling will increase, which means your reload, bolting action and ADS will be faster. Your weapon will also get a more 'looked after finish ' to it. Upon reaching level 50 you may get an attachement, you handling will increase again and you weapon will  have a shiny polished finish.I have taken my time to explain the ranking system as many people have asked me about it ingame.Realism mode for multiplayer seems to be very popular, unlike the classic mode. Realism is the 'hardcore' mode of the game. It is by far the best mode and obviously the more realistic. Bullet damage is increased and there is no aiming dead-zone (as you pivot the direction the bullet will go isn't locked to the center of the screen, if you don't understand you will when you play it). As for servers go they are all very stable, with barely any dedicated Tripwire servers there will always be a server for you. There are usually about 5 or six servers up at any one moment.CAMPAIGN: It has a good campaign which is a good length, split into two parts, the Russian campaign and the German Campaign.I have one problem though; the campaign missions are styled like the multiplayer missions, you will need to capture areas just like you do in the multiplayer and you will play on exactly the same maps and instead of live players you play with AI.I must commend Tripwire for including this as not many modern games are styled in this way, but it just fails to keep you playing, with no interesting plot I feel the game is weakened by the campaign. RISING STORM:The Rising Storm standalone game/DLC features the RO2 multiplayer but set in the pacific with the Japanese and the Americans. I feel that Rising Storm is a much more refined game and stamps out most of the bugs seen in RO2 multiplayer. RS does not have a campaign.Campaign = 6/10RO2 Multiplayer = 8.5/10Rising Storm = 9.5/10NOTE!::: IF YOU WANT THE RED ORCHESTRA 2 MULTIPLAYER, BUY RISING STORM, BOTH MULTIPLAYERS ARE PART OF THE RISING STORM DLC. IF YOU WANT THE RO2 CAMPAIGN JUST BUY THE BASE GAME. I DON'T THINK YOU GET RO2 MULTIPLAYER WITH RO2 ANYMORE.			",97,5,0,2,8,0,8

												At first I hated this game, but once my friend showed me what I had to do and what not it was pretty fun. There is about a 4 day period where you will most likly pick up on what you actually will have to do to be good at this game, so give it time.			",86,9,1,3,2,0,2

												Ok, So here is the review for Red Orchestra 2 with free Rising sun. I know the whole world has been eagerly waiting my next review. Don't worry you can stop holding your breath now it's here!The graphics are alot better than they appear in the trailer let it be noted. Although it automatically sets them to lowest setting for graphics so to first timers It will look like a rubbish graphical experience. But if you change them in options it is perfect. I can run on second highest out of about 8 options of graphics settings and still have some of the highest ping I have ever seen (My PC is not the best for gaming, I will say that much ;)Red Orchestra 2 (including Rising Storm) Is probably the most realistic combat simulator since Arma 2, And 5 times the fun.For the first 5 hours you will find it damn near impossible to do anything right, Unless you are an MLG pro like me (add me on club penguin at [BlazeItMichael]_Xxx_B*tchesOnMyD*ck_Xxxv). Although it is definitley worth sticking with, as after the nooby period you will become Adept (Much Like Skyrim) And be able to run, duck, survive and pull off some pretty amazing if not entertaining as hell kills. Especially as a Japanese banzia charger. To clarify there are vehicles (Not as many as Heroes and Generals but still enough.) There aren't ships or planes as I suspect that would almost ruin the game. You have enough weapons to start with and all of them are useful for different playstyles. Going rambo with a flamethrower was my initial favourite.... Until I realised my whole team was Laughing at me :(The game no matter what PC you have runs smoother than a very smooth and shiny rock (I didnt want to talk about Baby's bottoms because the NSA could be listening!) and the lowest I have seen my Ping being 80 no matter what server I'm on. Aswell the servers are up 24/7 and there is a constant dedicated fanbase of players online and with a perfect 32 a side on most servers there is no shortage of people to play with. There are also mod/community map and weapon and vehicle and texture supports including a workshop page.I haven't had the game long. But I am now enjoying it and find it hard to put it down for five minutes. The time it took to write this review was torture enough without being able to snipe some soviet pigs!There are 4 factions available Russia vs Germany and Japan vs US although more may be added through mods/updates.And when you become a pro you will have the best time ever pulling off headshots from 300 meters with a rusty 70 year old soviet revolver.Wow steam... The fact that you even dare to ask me wether I want to recommend this game or not is shocking....P.S Has all the gore and laughs of Chivalry (Yes including a bit of teamkilling.) But runs ten times smoother and don't have to put up with as many hackers.			",105,6,1,8,3,1,12

												I woke up to see this game in the steam store, I quickly downloaded it to see what the hype was all about, as soon as it was downloaded I was about to click the play button when all of a sudden I got a knock at the door, I was startled at first so I jumped up to check the peep hole, and whoever it was on the other side had their finger over it so I got suspicious an grabbed my gun, I yelled ""who's there!?"" No reply so I asked once more... I got the same silence so after contemplating for the next several minutes I decided to open the door.My initial reaction was to shoot....BANG...BANG...BANG... I stood in shock as I found out it was my american stepbrother.I was in tears, he was dead, all three of my rounds had entered his heart...but then I looked down he had his laptop in his hands...with this exact game running. He had come over to see if I had bought and downloaded it because this game is so awesome. So I played Red Orchestra 2 on his laptop for many hours, over his cold dead body...8/10 Would shoot again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Te gusta morir? Te gusta que tus compañeros te peguen tiros o te despedacen a base de granadas ""lanzadas accidentalmente sobre tu cogote"" y que ademas se metan contigo por haberte puesto en medio? Te gusta tener un ratio de Kill/Death de 0,1? lo que se traduce en matar a 1 por cada 100 balazos en tu precioso cogote y de vez en cuando en tus partes sensibles (no pongo la palabra literal porque sino me la censuran)? Quieres sentir como un nivel 99 que tiene mas de 1000 horas jugadas te vuela la cabeza tan rapido que mueres en muchas dimensiones al mismo tiempo y lo mejor de todo esque nunca sabes por donde te van a caer las ostias? Te gusta gastar cargadores enteros sobre tus amigos y mejor todavia, te gusta gastar cargadores y cargadores enteros de balas y que todas ellas no den absolutamente a nada y a nadie? Te gustan los ascensores? entonces te encantara Grain Elevator. Te gusta el fuego? entonces te encantara el fuego a 30 metros que es a donde llega el lanzallamas. Te gustan los Lideres de Escuadrón (Squad Lider que ofrecen puntos de respawn) que estan siempre muertos y que no hacen mas que joder y tocar las bolas con el humo? Te gustan los Comandantes inteligentes y estrategas que se dedican a utilizar la genial y prodigiosa estrategia mortal de lanzar artilleria sobre las pobres y desamparadas cabezas de sus propios hombres? Te gusta ser Fusilero (Rifleman) que solo tiene un fusil que como no hayas jugado mucho fallaras mas que una escopeta de feria? pues mejor para ti porque la mayoria de veces sera lo unico a lo que juegues porque como en España el internet esta como esta y  la mayoria del mundo civilizado de se conecta como 20 segundos antes que tu lo habran cojido TODO, excpeto rifleman porque? pues porque es la tipica clase que no coje ni tu abuela. Te gusta el MicSpawn? pues mejor para ti porque podras disfrutar de gente discutiendo en idiomas queno entiende ni el tato y ademas sobre temas que no vienen a cuento como por ejemplo, ir perdiendo la partida y en vez de hablar sobre com darle la vuelta ponerse a hablar sobre la Revolucion Francesa algo muy normal. AVISO: es muy raro no encontrarse grupos asi, quedais advertidos. Eres suicida y te gusta correr con una granada en las manos y luego hacer volar a un monton de amigos porque no has llegado a tu enemigo? entonces te aconsejo que seas Japones, ya que son unos flipados de la vida con una katana ( eso si no todas las clases la llevan, lo siento por si os pensabais que habian samurais o algo) y van corriendo como locos con mucho amor y ademas dopados (si dopados porque cuando hacen eso tienen bonificacion de resistencia y de daño, es decir que se colocan en modo OP). Si no te gusta ni la mitad de las cosas entonces no te recomiendo que lo juegues porque cada hora que juegas aumentaran tus posibilidades de desarrollar un intenso sentimiento de frustracion que haran que acabes como el niño aleman loco ( si ese niño que aporreaba el teclado y dejo el ordeador echo papilla).NOTA: este juego tambien se le conoce como Red Frustration 2			",90,5,0,7,7,0,7

												The very first Communists were early Slavic tribes who owned so little they had to share everything. They were renowned warriors, whose battle tactics consisted of getting as drunk as mortally possible, then drink twice as much more and charge at the enemy wielding a hammer in one hand and a sickle in the other. Even in these early times they were called the Red Army for their red faces (esp. noses). A Communist Warrior was terrible to behold in battle, bashing, slicing, and breathing alcoholic fumes at his enemies. Mortally wounded, he would merely fall asleep at the field of battle, only to wake up the next morning with regenerated limbs, healed wounds and a severe headache. ",134,22,2,9,10,2,13

												Do you want PTSD lite?If the answer is yes, then this game is for you!  This game is somewhere on the realism spectrum between a generic shooter, and an Arma game (And it leans closer to the Arma side).  The game has a very short time to kill, usually one or two bullets will finish the job pretty well, although if you can disengage,  minor injuries can sometimes be bandaged before you bleed out (and you can bleed out).  The real delight of the game is its scale and visuals.  it's best played on 64 player servers, with as many players as possible, which can make the game fairly chaotic.  Visually, the game is not the most beautiful, although it is by no means ugly, but it does a good job at portraying sone of the more horrible aspects of war, limbs can come off, although blood is not overdone, like in some games, and the game is filled with lots of little thing that catch your eye.Anyway, I think I will end with a story from my time in game:         I was in the gunnery seat of a panzer IV, when a T-34 roles onto the street directly ahead.  I sight the gun to my estimated range and fire.  The shell shattered on impact, dealing little to no damage.  I hear a pinging noise on the right side of the tank, probably machine gun fire, I think to myself.  I  adjust my sights and wait for my loader to finish loading the shell.  After waiting some time for confirmation that the shell is loaded, I try firing anyway.  Click.  There's no shell in the barrel.  The T-34 fires, their shell bounces off the side of the tank.  I take the momentary break to take a look at the crew compartment of my Panzer IV.  Everyone in the tank is dead, and there are several holes on the right side that appear to have come from anti tank rifles.  Only my loader is still alive, and he's missing both his legs, cradling a shell and crying for his mother.  There's nothing left for me in this tank, and I evacuate out of the Hatch on the left side. Right as I have just exited, the anti tank rifles start peppering the sides again, as I'm climbing down from the tank a round penetrates and impacts the ammunition racks.  The tank explodes violently and I'm cast several feet from the vehicle, slowly bleeding out on the ground.			",94,13,0,27,25,1,54

												Absolutely reccomend to fans of the WW2 FPS Genre, but specifically if you're into tactical gameplay. While not overly complex it takes both map knowledge and role knowledge in order for the player to be a sucessful member of the team and be able to enjoy your experience in Red Orchestra 2. A highly detailed game when it comes to battlefield mechanics, cover, suppression and co-ordinated movements are the centerpieces of the gameplay. Visiuals and audio are incredibly raw and immersive, playing realism mode (reccomended) will place you straight on the frontlines of an absolute slaughter in which every inch you fight for is a hard earned and a glorious victory. The environment is as detailed and important as the weapon in your hands, excellent map design makes the Territory playstyle a sandbox in which to learn, hone skills and dominate the opposistion. Wonderful game with a steep learning curve but nothing out of the oridinary, basic tips are to slow down and listen to your team leaders who most often have mics to inform the team of their decisions and calls. Play the training levels, roll rifleman, and read the below guide in order to familiarize yourself with what your prioirities are as a newbie and work your way up fro there. :Posistives:+ Immersion + Detailed period weaponry/world+ Teamwork oriented + Multiple playstyles & recent Rising Storm Expansion + Operator as fuark:Negatives:- Steep learning curve- Cover system is finnecky and shouldn't be used over Cover/Concealment http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/cover-and-concealment/- PTSD:Intro to playing Red orchestra 2:

												I've played some FPS so far, but I think, none is better than Red Orchestra/Rising Storm. Why is this? It has some really good tactic element which are placed together with a good leader system. The whole team is sepparated into squads, each with an own Squadleader, whilst the commander issues the over-all-orders. Also this system is quite easy to handle and allows tactical playing with total strangers quite easy.Also the setting in World War II and the use of authentic weapons gives you a complete different feeling like in games like Call of Duty. With many team members just having bolt action or semi automatic rifles there's no chance for rushing. You have to take care for everyone of your steps. Especially in realism mode which I really like.The graphics on the other hand aren't that good. Still nice to view, but there are shooters with better graphics. But those shooters going for the graphics and the always same quite dull gaming experience (I'm looking at you CoD series and BF series!) can't compare to this one in the gameplay.

												A Great Game,You can run crouching holding your gun as reality and much more realstic movement such as comparing to when you use to play older games of WWII and you'd see the AI move realstic and do much more then you could and you couldn't do any of it. Now you can do some. The Game is good for the movements and the realism of not just Run and Gun. Bringing you to the depths of War. Under pressure and Paranoia of whos in the next room or behind you or watching you under a scope reporting you to a High Kommanding Officer. This Game is fun unless you wish for it to be Gun and Run and then it will be OLD quickly and not worth the price for that matter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I´ve been playing RO2 since it came out and I have to say that reguarding my all-time multiplayer experiance, this game is the undoubted number one. This is a game that, in my experiance, sometimes has more immersion in multiplayer than some singleplayer games have to offer. It just ""drags"" you into it when you sit in your ruin with your rifle in hand, hear artillery shells and russian officers shouting right around the corner. What I have to say though is, that I´am pretty sure that this is not a game for everyone. You can not expect a fast and rewarding game like BF3, where level ups and unlocks are easy to achieve. Especially for beginners it can and will get very, very frustrating since you have to actually focus on what and how you shoot. It´s a realistic game and I personally love it for that. positive: -Most realistic shooter I know-detailed uniforms, weapons and animations-a lot of maps-immersion even in multiplayer-weapon unlocksNegatives: -Unreal theree engine isn´t the particular newest and best looking one, but it does it´s job and you don´t have much time to look around anyway. -frustrating at the beginning-single player is obsolete (you just play the mp maps against bots)-only two vehicles			",56,1,7,5,15,0,27

												A very fun and enjoyable game, I could not be more pleased with this game. If you want action style gameplay play regular game mode, if you like realism like myself play on realism servers. RO2/RS's realism mode is by far the most enjoyable/playable realism approach I have seen in an FPS video game. Warning! This game is not in any way like the COD franchise nor Halo so if you are thinking that it might... you are mistaken. Note: There are bots to if you want to break away from the player vs player or have a few players and fill the rest of the game with bots.			",210,18,6,22,10,1,29

Tired of multiplayer games having no teamplay anymore?This game is exactly what you're looking for and more.This game has a great community that communicates ingame.Constant updates & patches, that fix bugs and bring new free content for the game.One major expansion that is well worth the money.Lots of custom maps created by the community of this game.Tactical depth no other major fps can call his own and a terryfing, realistic atmosphere.Pretty much everything you want from a realistic first person shooter.Support those guys, the game is worth the money!

Now that it's been sometime and now that I have played ARMA II all I can say is that the two games of a bit of a relation witch would be a simulation of real life. It makes you feel as if you are really there.If you liked ARMA II then you will love this game or if you like games that have a bite in complicated controls to make you feel more in the game.

												The most realistic, unforgiving WW2 game out there. No crosshairs, no ""Killcam"", and no ammo counter. You have to physically open the rifle bolt or handgun slide to roughly check how many bullets are left. There is bullet drop and bullets will penetrate through objects and walls. You can manually select between automatic and semi auto fire. You can also adjust iron sights for distance and the iron sights actually move. If you get shot you have to stop and bandage or you will bleed out and die. Most of the time though one bullet is all it takes for you to die instantly. You hear your player breathing when you aim down your sights and the sights go up and down slightly in sync with your breathing, until you hold your breath. Some servers also do not show teammates names above their heads so you have to visualy make sure it is an enemy by their clothing. All servers always have friendly fire on. This game is not for people who get frustrated with realistic fps games. This game relies very very heavily on teamwork, so much more than in say any of the Battlefield games. If you love realistic WW2 games though then this is the game for you.			",14,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are lucky enough to not suffer bugs with this beast of a shooter, its probably going to be one of the best games youve played in a long long time. This is oldskool skill and determination coupled with the best first-person cover system ive ever seen. The guns feel awesome; theres bullet drop, adjustable ironsights, manual clip-checking, fully crewed tanks and an impressive bleeding mechanic. When the game works (admittedly its a buggy piece of crap) you realise its just... perfect :DIf you call yourself a fps player, and are bored of CoD style empty gameplay gimmicks (in my book they are mutually exclusive, harsh ;p) get this game before they fix all the bugs :D			",692,128,14,74,46,1,63

												I recommend this game for those who want a realistic warfare game. I find this game to be the a good hybrid between Arma operation Arrowhead and Battlefield 3. Though this game does have its cons. First of all the singleplayer campaign is nothing more than capture or defend the flag with some cutscenes. The AI is noticeabley bad and is very unresponsive to commands given, though the game in itself is based around the intense multiplayer. I would recommend this game for people with higher quality pcs as it does have stability issues. WIthout the stability issues this game would get a 9 out of 10, but because it is glitchy in some aspects this game only recieves an 8. I would not recommend this game for people who are seaking action and instant gratification. This game requires slow and tactical thinking as well as strong teamwork. The player base is quite forgiving and with some practice is pretty easy to get used to			",83,2,1,7,16,0,25

The learning curve is steep but once you get the hang of the unique gameplay style you'll find it to be one of the most satisfying, authentic and thrilling shooting games you've ever played.

												Why the bloody hell not? It's a logical alternative when you are tired of the usual run-and-gun games like the Call of Duty Franchise. It puts you right at the heart of WW2's most bloodiest theatres, the Eastern Front (known as the Great Patriotic War for our Russian friends). Once more, why the hell not? There's no storyline, no cinematics. Just war being squeezed into a PC game in the most advanced, realistic way possible. That's not enough? Try Multiplayer. You'll actually feel what its like to be tactical, that your descisions affect the outcome of every engagement. Perhaps bringing your Springfield to the jungles of Guadalcanal might not be the most optimal choice, nor is running around whilst firing from the hip with your MP40 at a T-34 during Operation Barashka. The only flaw I found so far about RO2 is the AI, which is often dull, deaf, or daft. Other than that, good game. Buy.			",34,2,0,1,1,0,3

												By far my favorite FPS. I've played lots of them, and I'm a huge fan in the FPS genre. From Medal of Honor back in the day, to Call of Duty, Battlefield series, Halo, Killzone, you name it I've played it. But I just love the tactical nature of RO2, the team work really feels like you are a part of an army battling for supremacy. The realistic nature took me awhile to get use to as I died hundreds of times when I blindly would run straight into battle. But learning the value of life, and just how close you are to death really makes this game thrilling. You can die at anytime from anywhere! Now this might sound terrible, but it's so satisfying when you get the jump on your opponent. It's a great great game, great challenge loads of fun. I hope they release British troops, and US vs German maps soon. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												you will come home from the war a jaded veteran. your dreams are dead and your wife will try, but the passion is gone forever. the more you're home the more you want back out there. you'll start drinking, to muffle the sounds of dying comrades and blazing foes alike, one night you'll have a little too much and slap your wife around when she tries to pass off a tv-dinner as her own creation. she'll cry and you'll promise her it'll never happen again, but as you go through the motions day by day, you feel more and more empty inside.until finally you'll find salvation is the barrel of a gun pressed against the roof of your mouth, your brain splatter the canvas with which you paint your way to valhalla, the cheers of comrades in arms once more battering against your eardrums.welcome home, warrior			",79,9,1,11,10,0,25

												The game is absolutely fabolous. The atmosphere is Top-Notch, and at the same time this is very cheap compared to AAA games. I can not however call this game flawless, as much as i love it. The game has a lot of bugs and weird glitches, noone game-breaking however.Gameplay - The gameplay is absolutely Top-Tier, however, you DO want to go to realism servers everytime, as the game is NO fun without it. The game encourages the use of cover and terrain, instead of just bum-rushing into a flamethrower. The game also incorporates a morale sort of system, the only system to date that allows suppresing fire to be effective, by making your character♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants when large amounts of bullets or mortar shells fly past them. Looking at a dying comrade will also make your character react negatively.Sound - As an essential part of the atmosphere, the sound is very good, so you definetly do want to get a good headset before playing this, to get the full experience. When hiding in your hole or trench you will be able to hear the bullets whistling over you, as well as the sound of the machineguns firing in the distance.Graphics - Due to being run on the Unreal Engine, the game has decent graphics, but nothing to write home about. The textures are pretty ugly, but as long as you dont specifically look for texture flaws, you wont notice at all. The game is beatifull, as the maps are very well designed with flora and terrain.All in all this game is a must-have for players who want a great game with a higher focus on realism than their average CoD.8 out of 10.

Overall, I enjoy the hyper realistic environments with the actual level strategy and detail that this game has to offer. If you enjoy FPS games such as Insurgency, I would definitely recommend this game. ",105,8,0,15,5,0,5

												The game starts off really harsh and unforgiving. Once you join a server, you have no idea what to do(that is implying uve just went through the tutorial briefly or not at all), who is who, where to go, what objectives do you have, what ""capture"" means, etc. Fear not, after some time, you will get the hang of it, and going through the tutorial, although it doesnt help much, is better then going str8 in. Give this game some of your time, and i am sure you will find out why so many people like it.			",142,18,3,7,13,1,30

												I may have only played two hours of this game,but I only needed 20 minutes to know this is the best WW2 game on steam.In my first 10 minutes of gameplay I was actually laughing at how much fun I was having,it is not only fun but immersive,well optimised,tactical and pretty darn accurate to the time period.I'll tell you one of my experiences.I was a American sniper on the frontline attempting to reatake a beach held by Japanese,my team was fighting fiercely but it was to almost no avail,it seemed the Japanese reinforcements were almost endless. As the clock was winding down, someone called in artillery on the enemy snipers wiping them out and giving our infantry a chance to move up,the automatic riflemen stormed the jap trenches and a vicious gun battle ensues but once more the Japanese manage to fight off our attack, I decide it is time to make my move. I leave my sniper nest and push the left flank with 3 riflemen, we were in a prime attack position, we get into cover and open fire I take out ten soldiers and the two riflemen with me do the same but the enemy eventually worked out our position and launched a small counter attack that caught us by suprise.We managed to fight off this attack but had lost sight of 1 of the attackers,time is very low and we need to push into the trenches,just as we are about to storm the trenches I see the missing attacker sneaking up behind one of my riflemen, I ready my gun and take my shot, it blows the sneaky jap's head off and my character yells out,""That was for Pearl Harbour"",We then storm the trench from left side and take out the remaining resistance,I jump a on mounted mg and hold off the enemy until my team arrived, once they did we took back the beach back and won the battle.Hoorah!If you want a brilliant WW2 shooter,actually scratch that,if you want a brilliant game,then this is for you.

												Personal Experience:I was a russian soldier lucky enough to received a mosin rifle. We were assembeld to recapture the bridges of druzhina.After a short but inspireing speech of our commander we charged towards the enemy lines with a resounding UHHRRRAAAAA. Then little dots started up flickering at the horizon. Multiple machine guns and rifles opened up on us. Two, three, ten of us were cut down instantly the rest crawling forward. Artillary is shattering the lines and our approach now. Between the shells landing we darted forward as long as the enemy is still suppressed. I barely reached the first objective to capture. Everywhere smoke, men shouting, cursing, dying, shooting. I take my hand grenades and throw them towards the trenches of the german machine gun nest. I kill two of them, then charging with my mosin and the fixed bayonetts towards the trench. On my left my squadleader spraying with his ppsh as if he would hit something while running. Then I reach the trench bayonetting one more german. But there is a second. I engage him but he raises his mp40 first. I feel burst on my chests. Knowing it's over I turn my rifle at him but only just. Fire one last round from the hip to kill him before blacking out....Only to be respawned and charge again. UUUUURRAAAAAAHAHAHAA.

												The best multiplayer PC FPS of the past 10 years. Marred by a very rocky start (multiple bugs, some of which are still around), broken promises (to this day the game has a risible dearth of vehicles of all kinds, especially compared to its predecessor) and horrible developer PR, Red Orchestra 2 is the definitive proof that first impressions do matter. It is nonetheless one of the most authentic and thrilling infantry simulations I have ever played, while still retaining a good deal of smooth movement and playability. It feels largely like a proper FPS, unlike something like ArmA, though most of its maps can still be played in a similar fashion (with deliberate pacing and lots of caution). The engagement distances are decidedly shorter than the average milsim's (you're not going to be fighting anyone much further than 250m away), but it really does feels proper to the mostly urban Stalingrad setting. The closest equivalent in scope and execution I can think of is the Project Reality mod.But what of the game? A class-based affair in multiple gametypes, with most Russian and German WW2 mainstays very faithfully represented. The game oozes ambition and sports a plethora of small innovations (It takes playing it so you can believe just how organic, polished and ""right"" the always-on free aim system feels - do yourself a favor and play the game on Realism servers), most of which directly enable the game's very tense and kinetic infantry engagements. If you have any interest and appreciation for the FPS genre at all, it will be impossible to play this game and not bear witness to its constant displays of genius and obvious evidence of superior design and workmanship. If you constantly complain about the ""fact"" that every FPS ""wants to be COD"" nowadays, put your money where your mouth is and delve deep into RO2. You won't regret it - Tripwire gave the gaming world a diamond in the rough, and has mostly polished it into a shining gem of a FPS - An accomplished example of what PC gaming is all about.

This game combines your map awerness, team play, and patient (a lot of them) in order to bring victory to your team. Amazing game.Only drawback is on the start the movement of the character might feel a little bit sluggish compare to to other shooters. 130 hours in the game and I still cannot master the movement in this game, it is just bad and not user friendly.

												The most realistic World War II i have every played. Realistic combat, weapons, and animations. (Axis soldiers run with weapons in one hand, Allies run with weapons in both hands). Helpful updates, and immersive combat that will make you play this game for hours and days without feeling the need to♥♥♥♥♥♥or eat. You might need a fairly well computer to run this or else you can run with the lowest settings (like me) and still have a blast. Most servers are European with the occasion of a handful of US Servers and i learned how to speak perfect British english and Russian from interacting with other gamers around the world (mostly British and Russian). So put down that Call of Duty and Battlefield; it's time to man up and pick up a Mosin Nagant, M1 Garand, or unsheath your family heirloom Katana. 900000000000000000000000/10 buy this game already			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's something about this game that's just awesome. I keep looking at the Steam store and my library thinking, ""What else can I play that's similar to RO2?"" Sadly nothing else even comes close to scratching the itch. I wish more people would play this, but other than that I have not much to fault on this game. This game to me is the product of the PC Game mod culture and what type of amazing ideas can spawn from it. If you haven't played it yet, I'd suggest buying it, giving it some time, and learning what a real meaty FPS is. Oh and it's WWII!			",149,7,2,23,19,0,55

												Never have I experienced war like this before. This is a great break from Call of Duty, Battlefield and really just any other shooters. Being a soilder stuck in a trench as the Japaness are Banzi charging is amazing! I would recommend buying Rising Storm and Red Orchestra 2. Rising storm is American V. Japanes and Red Orchestra is German V. Russians. All have unique guns and maps. Rising Storm has a little bit better graphics than Red Orchestra. But Rising Storm on some maps don't get that awsome feel like Red Orchestra. I mean like running up a hill attacking the japanes is cool in all but when you running down a street and a russian gets on a DP and starts raining hell on you in a city warfare fight is just plane badass. Rising Strom has more of a jungle/damged island kind of map style when Red Orchestra 2 has more of a city/forest/country map. Rising storm there is more auto guns and semi guns and bolt action. Red Orchestra offers mostly bolt action and if you are lucky you can get a SMG or semi auto sniper or LMG you will mostly be playing with bolt action rifles. Rising storm is not for the players who like to rush like in Call of Duty. This game means you have to work together as a tea to fight the enemy. There is no man for his self in the game. You need to work together. This game has some of the most amazing moment of all games. My most favorite games of all is Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2. Gameplay 10/10 Players 9/10 graphics 9/10 guns 10/10. This is a buy if you ask me!			",108,5,3,4,4,1,5

												Extremely immersive, great sound and realistic graphics (though one could desire a bit more clean of an FOV), realistic combat (realistic objectives, one or two shots and you're dead, suppresion effects, weapon handling, no mini-map) plentiful maps and modes, including community made maps that are being awarded by tripwire (who keep updating this game with new content). Is very different from other shooters, so don't expect Battlefield, COD or even Arma. This game is not just about scoring points and unlocking stuff, this game is about taking it all in and actually feeling immersed.			",139,9,1,6,12,0,29

												if you want a slow paced infantry based world war 2 game, this is the game. you die from 1-2 hits, and only a few players get good equipment, while the rest gets crap equipment. i can't really set my finger on what makes this game great, but it's probably one of my favorite games. i think it is because of the survival aspect of the game. many of the maps have nearly no cover and it's so spooky to slowly crawl forwards while bullets zip by your head. bandage wounds, have an epic shootoff while your shocked and adrenaline pumped character slowly pases out after being filled with bullets. also: i love that the character talks and shouts alot. makes it more realistic and personal in my opinion..  this game gets a 9/10btw. the bots are awful.

												Lovely game and frustrating as hell, but that's what makes it good. I'm glad I got it. Tripwire has never let me down.As of this recommendation, the game is bugridden and you got CoD/TF2 Deathmatchers just camping and not following orders. In a few months everything should be about fixed and the kiddies should have left already due to being too frustrated to continue playing so you'll have the hardcore/team oriented players still left.Plus the price might be down as well.The ""realism"" in this game is wonderful. If you get shot, you bleed and you have a few seconds to patch up before you die. You can dial in your range for your guns and weapon placements and everything just seems so authentic.The class limits help even out the game as well. You've got 1 Commander about 4 Squad leaders, Numerous riflemen, 1 - 2 Marksmen as well as others. Maps are large and expansive. You'll get shot at from distance a lot while traversing the battlefield.Buy it once it's cheaper.			",135,12,2,20,10,2,21

												Great game, Puts you right in the action on entering the battlefield, Maps are great size! full of cover to cover action wheather sitting back Sniping the enemy, Calling in airstrikes and Recon planes or Mowing  down groups with the LMG. ofcourse there are more classes then that, they stepped up there game using Unreal engine to get you duck for shooting through War rubbled buildings fighting for control in the battlefront style gamplay. it keeps you entertained as a Massivley multiplayer FPS for Ages, always having plenty to do. The realism is great as its not going to be easy running up into enemy base without getting shutdown by enemy LMG and snipers in windows and destroyed buildings picking you of if your not careful.Tactic and Teamwork are very estential when moving up to take enemy Objectives you have to communicate with team and pick your spots and paths well which just really keeps you thinking and planning your next wave of attack.All in all the Devs have made a game that puts you in an overwhelming exp of the WW2 scene.

												Heroes Of Stalingrad is a realistic experience of WW2 unlike any other games i have played. I love WW2 games and this game gives a realistic feel that deepens the experience. I love the features like having to mentally track your ammo consumption and having to dial your sights over longer ranges. Rising Storm gives a fresh feel as it takes you out of the forests of Europe and into the ragged jungles of the Pacific islands. The asymmetrical gameplay allows you to understand the strengths and weaknesses of both nations.Red Orchestra 2 helps you to understand what it was really like in WW2. The damage is realistic with a rifle being a one shot kill to the head or torso, making the game a difficult yet exciting experience.Before i came across this game, the closest game I had were the earlier Call Of Duty games. And they felt too arcadey. I didnt like how it took 10 shots to kill and that the weapons all felt the same.But RO2 is an outstanding experience that rewards you on experience, while Heroes and Generals rewards you with in game currency.RO2 is great, please feel free to read the various guides and manuals that have been created by players in the community and on the web to see the many factors, features and gamplay that i hadnt the time to mention have fun all new players			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Orchestra 2 , the game full of death, chynic, bullets, hate and mercyless! It is you or the enemy!Personally I like the realism and challence of this game. A hard game for hardcore gamers who seek for real fight, not for CoD arcade or CS bunnyhop. HUD is minimal, moving is challencing, shooting through iron sights (no crosshair), the damage... well, you usually die from one shot or two, instantly or after short bleedout while crying for help. You really fight for you own survival and even a tiny mistake at critical moment could (and will) be fatal. The tactic is everything, it does not make any sense to run stright to next objective (you will find out very soon why). In this game you will be a nameless hero of stalingrad who fights for his comrades, for victory and simply for staying alive.IMO the very best WW2 game EVER made!!1!PS: Mkb42 (H) rules!

												I found this game very enjoyable and exciting. Along with the constant fear of death looming over my shoulder(Which is realistically scary and easy), I've had some of the most intense survival scenerios fighting off endless waves of soldiers, in one desperate attmept to stay alive. Also this game has got to be one of the most realistic First Person World War II games to date; from the actual dates of historic battles, to even the fact of not having access to certain weapons during a time when they weren't yet in service.  Although you will occasionally find an NPC doing a number on a wall, and some simply standing at the deployment with no idea what to do, the NPCs can actually fight for a change, instead of the norm of having the players be the only ones to get any kills. As far as the visuals go, the team behind the game did an excellent job at depicting the weapons from the war. For example; In the Rising Storm version, the United States soldiers have access to the Colt M1911A1, which in very detailed texturing shows the realistic patents and inscription on the slide of the handgun. Overall I'd give this game an 8.5/10, seeing as my few complaints have to do with the PvP aspect of the game.Conclusion; If you enjoy a good FPS game with lots of gunfire and guys running towards you with a katana, buy this game!

												A definitive must own for WWII fans.Didn't expect to like it that much.I mean come on, its germany, japan, russia, and america in one game! Pacific and Europe maps are just so well made that every type of a player (stealthy or aggresive) will find their place on any map. Besides the music is just so amazing, especially in Rising Storm. (listen for yourself and you'll know what i am saying)It gives so much atmosphere to the game, that you feel like you are there with all the soldiers!			",89,4,0,3,3,0,18

												I was charging a state-house with ten of my comrades when fascist artillery whistled down. A big red ball of fire and shards of metal formed thirty feet in front of me. Body parts went terminal velocity and connected with other comrades, killing them. I was blown back with injured legs, bleeding gallons per minute. I was able to bandage myself up and find cover. I took note of the blast area. Five unrecognizable bodies were in a pile, four other bodies were strewn about. One of the limbless husks were still screaming in pain, only to be drown out by incoming machinegun fire. Out of ten chargers, I was the sole survivor. The images still haunt me when I take my annual sail from Murmansk... PPsH 41/10, would break legs and watch men with organs tossed about die again...			",40,1,0,9,8,1,4

												     This game brings the values of teamwork from Ost front and then some.It has the grapical capabilites to make it feel genuine. From bleeding to death to almost getting your head blown of by a sniper's bullet.       This game's aspect of being a man of war is very well executed. It has tank combat which makes you feel like you're part of the crew. Or that you have animportant job on the team. Like being a machine gunner. You differ from the team and you have an important job. This is by far my favourite game.The bad thing is the frame dips and lag spikes however.Be aware that this game is also CPU based.

												Red Orchestra 2 might have been a game that I knew nothing about a few months ago. I got it when it was free. Usually, those type of games don't pique my interest for very long; this game was an exception. I played this game so much, dying non-stop, knowning nothing about the tactics involved and the tactical incetivised community. When I learned these things, I came to appreciate this game which offers some of the most fun and hard fought victories i've had in any FPS. Its fun, i'd recommend it to anyone who tries their hardest to win. Its a brutal world war 2 game, and it has enough depth and complexity to keep me comihg back to it again and again.

												This game is for those who enjoy realistic shooters. It is a WW2 shooter with seperate Germany vs Russia and US vs Japan modes. This game requires team effort to win. I highly recommend this game.Pros-Player can be instantly killed if shot in vital area.-Player can bandage themself if shot in non-vital area before they bleed to death.-Realistic weapons with bullet drop, overheating, and individual mags that each keep track of how full they are.-Matches can have tanks, which are highly realistic.Cons-Some maps encourage one side to spawn kill until they win.-Servers can have bots, which are very dumb and very susceptible to lag.

												Red Orchestra 2 / RIsing Storm is currently the best WW2 simulation shooter on pc. It features large amounts of maps, lots of content including being able to play on community made maps. This game has a steep learning curve however, and lacks a competent tutorial that explains the game other than the basic controls. 90% of servers available are playing on realism mode which is IMO the best mode but to newer players might be extremely fustrating. Overall a fantastic game with great features as long as you get past the learning curve.TL:DR- Best WW2 simulator- Lots of maps + content- Community maps- Steep learning curve, extremely basic tutorial- Most servers are on ""realism"" or essentially hardcore mode			",100,19,3,11,12,0,28

												A realistic WWII FPS. And we needed one.If you come from Battlefield-type games into RO2 or RS, you'll die a lot and get disappointed. Calm down, breathe, and pull the trigger. Most of the game is not spent running and jumping but staying in cover and crawling... unless everybody charges, off-course.You'll get used to the slow firing (bolt-action) weapons and soon you'll be enjoying a very good simulation of WWII combat.Realistic servers are a must in multiplayer.

												So I bought this during the Steam summer sale and I have to say they have made good progress since releasing RO 2 for those that had original left them a bad taste I think they have made up for it with this and considering you get access to all features from both RO2 and Risingstorm MP it was a great deal.  Now atmosphere and experience in this game I have to say this is the most tense exilerating WWII MP FPS i've played in resent memory.  It's not your COD of FPS's either you need to coordinate attacks not run & gun setup ambush emplacements, etc... lot's of strategic depth for an FPS on how you approach your objective.  The commander mode soo much fun in it's own right it reminds me a little of commander mode in BF2.  Visually the game is gritty.  Nothing more chillin then watching your teamate in front of you explode into body parts because he ran into a well placed boobie trap by the enemy to the point you tell yourself ""Damn that could of been me"".  It's gritty that when I torch players in this game I almost have a pang of sympathy for my enemy as he does a death curling scream.  My score is a 8.9/10			",158,32,2,31,11,3,41

												Lets take a look at most of these game that are FPS and claim to be realistic games. They tend to normally be a bunch of players just running around clueless shooting everything they see. Theres no teamwork, little strategy..This games is far better than alot of the 2013-2014 main name released like bf4 and the cod's. Not graphically, but in terms of gameplay and realism. I honestly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good realistic challenge, working in squads of players who play the game tactically. The ingame voice quality is not the best ever, but is still very clear and good.I recommend looking at some footage on youtube .. search for ""Red orcestra 2 multiplayer gameplay"" and see what you think.

												Really fun shooter. Has a similar addictive quality to Call of Duty. However the style of play is a lot more like a simulation of warfare from the period of WW2. Graphics are better than the original and some of the maps are really fun and don't get old quickly as they can be approached in different ways strategically. Realistic and not an easy game, you have to focus to do well. But great fun and usually has a mature and often amusing community. The authenticity of the weapons, uniforms, in some cases locations really adds to the fun fps war gaming. Only thing this lacks is perhaps some confusing GUI and would also be nice to see more of the user maps being used on the larger servers, any fan of simulation fps or WW2 nostalgia should definately have a go at this.

												This game is absolutely brilliant. The only things that drag it down are the technical issues, and given time, even those may be completely gone in a few months. Sure, this game isn't for everyone, but if you play it like it was intended - with collaboration - you will find one of the deepest shooter experiences around on the current market. Don't throw it away the instant you get killed fifteen times in a row… treat it as what it is - an intense, brutal, unforgiving (yet unforgettable) and realistic shooter with more than a few technical issues. Get back up, pick up your rifle and practice a new tactic. But even if you do learn the layout of certain maps, be prepared to have your most trusted strategies become useless when pitted against a good team.To make things even better, a huge & free patch (carrying a hefty 5 GBs of new content) that was promised to the fans has been released by the developers. It separates the whole multiplayer experience into three main modes: realism mode (the game as it was before, with some expected fixes), action mode (or in other words: an attempt to appeal to CoD fanboys, which adds many unrealistic features to the game and feels like it detracts from the core game and what it stands for) and classic mode (which is exactly what veterans from the first game have been waiting for - the return of many realistic features from RO1, and probably the most powerful of the three modes).Red Orchestra 2 is played best on realism and classic modes. If you want to experience something truly amazing, just ignore servers playing on action mode. Mind you, this action mode is still more realistic than many other shooters out there - but overall its existence is uncalled for. Among other new things included in this update are native language packs (that's right, no more English with foreign accents - you can now choose to play the game with Russian and German only audio) and the game seems to be even more optimized for better fps.Finally, the ""Rising Storm"" expansion pack (originally a mod, but later supported by Tripwire Interactive throughout its development to become official additional content for the game) has been released. For a reasonable price, it gives us plenty of exciting new maps - each set in the Pacific theatre of World War II. The two new playable factions are the soldiers of the USA and Japan. These different playable troops come with tons of new content in the form of weapons, special abilities and tactics. The new factions and maps feel fresh & exciting enough to enhance the Red Orchestra formula, whilst staying true to the series' realistic and atmospheric core.			",85,5,0,7,4,1,14

												The best multiplayer PC FPS of the past 10 years. Marred by a very rocky start (multiple bugs, some of which are still around), broken promises (to this day the game has a risible dearth of vehicles of all kinds, especially compared to its predecessor) and horrible developer PR, Red Orchestra 2 is the definitive proof that first impressions do matter. It is nonetheless one of the most authentic and thrilling infantry simulations I have ever played, while still retaining a good deal of smooth movement and playability. It feels largely like a proper FPS, unlike something like ArmA, though most of its maps can still be played in a similar fashion (with deliberate pacing and lots of caution). The engagement distances are decidedly shorter than the average milsim's (you're not going to be fighting anyone much further than 250m away), but it really does feels proper to the mostly urban Stalingrad setting. The closest equivalent in scope and execution I can think of is the Project Reality mod.But what of the game? A class-based affair in multiple gametypes, with most Russian and German WW2 mainstays very faithfully represented. The game oozes ambition and sports a plethora of small innovations (It takes playing it so you can believe just how organic, polished and ""right"" the always-on free aim system feels - do yourself a favor and play the game on Realism servers), most of which directly enable the game's very tense and kinetic infantry engagements. If you have any interest and appreciation for the FPS genre at all, it will be impossible to play this game and not bear witness to its constant displays of genius and obvious evidence of superior design and workmanship. If you constantly complain about the ""fact"" that every FPS ""wants to be COD"" nowadays, put your money where your mouth is and delve deep into RO2. You won't regret it - Tripwire gave the gaming world a diamond in the rough, and has mostly polished it into a shining gem of a FPS - An accomplished example of what PC gaming is all about.

												Best WW2 game hands down! This isn't some typical run and gun your way to victory type game, this game can only be won with teamwork, blood, sweat, and tears. But the reason I love this game so much is how much it immerses you into a battle. You hear screams of pain as fellow soldiers fall to the ground dead, you watch as enemies get mowed down by MG fire, you watch your screen go black while you slowly bleed to death, and then you realize this is a video game. The game is about what soldiers in this dark period in history had to see and do. No side is demonized whether you're on the Russian, German, American, or Japanese side. You are a soldier fighting for his country, his brothers in arms, and his own life. So pick up your mosin, kar, garand, or arisaka and get ready for war!			",33,1,0,1,4,0,6

												Red Orchestra 2 manages to straddle that fine line between semi-realism and gameplay. This is one of those rare and excellent Second World War shooters to play. It is highly thrilling, tense and satisfying. Weapons and bullet drop are represented impressively and the sense of accomplishment from survival and completing objectives make it worthwhile.An authentic level of vulnerability, tension and stress makes the game harrowing. It is rare to find a game that almost captures the brutality and intensity, but I find that Red Orchestra 2 comes quite close.Athough not perfect, with several awkward flaws (weapons unlock and casual modes) and rough implementation (campaign mode), for someone like myself not inclined to shooters I cannot seem to figure out how Red Orchestra suceeds. Teamwork matters between the commander and squads while caution and bravado occasionally nets results. I am not sure I will find another game in the future as compelling as this, in an age of shooters too afraid to offer tactical depth at the expense of accessibility			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 is best experienced in multiplayer. There is offline play with bots but they're abit wonky and need improvements..They'll run randomly in aimless directions sometimes.Aside from that, Multiplayer experience is awesome as you really need to work with your team to hold/capture the objective. It is much more intense than the offline play with bots. You'll find that supressing fire works really effectively in providing support. Artillery strikes are also incredibly useful in halting an enemy advance and can totally decimate an entire squad in the area. Smoke grenades are a great for flanking or doing a charge.Great multiplayer experience (+)There are alot of maps available to choose from (+)Multiple classes to choose (+)Numerous gamemodes (+)Realism (+)Bots in offline play need improvements (-)Weapon variety is a little lacking (-)			",136,16,0,24,14,0,8

												Okay, so you are tired of those futuristic or modern military shooters? Your best choice is Red Orchestra 2. This game is so realistic, that in right server it feels almost like you're in real war. All this pressure builds up, when you're in a ditch and Soviet pigs are surrounding you. That feel when you have last few bullets and your last choice is to grab that old Kar98 and use bayonette to protect your position. This game is most definetly the best WWII game out there and it builds up so much pressure in the right server, that after the first map you most likely will be exhausted. Oh and since it's complete realism, then even a single bullet to your knee might kill you, if you won't stop the bleeding fast enough. You can call it ditch simulator if you want, because it aint some CS:GO/CoD/BF or some♥♥♥♥♥♥			",403,89,14,50,30,7,57

Used it to keep me up when keeping my girlfriend company during late night study sessions, the fast pace but long games were great at keeping me awake and constantly occupied.Drawbacks are there is no air combat, the vehicle combat is limited at this time, and the devs seem to be moving very slowly at completing the things they intended to put into this game. Note that while this is a great game in and of itself, of you look at the first Red Orchestra, you can see the potential the devs can do with this one, and you might feel a bit impatient that they hop on that, too. Also, kinda tough to start, but once you learn how to play, nobody will be mad at you anymore. Just make sure you communicate with your team and you should be okay. Terrible single player, but you buy this game for single player like you get Team Fortress 2 for single player: you just don't. In summary: AWESOME game for WW2 and realism shooter fans. WORTH IT. Excellent multiplayer. Don't get this for single player. If you played the first game, you might feel it's got half the vehicles and half the map sizes, but the gameplay is so different that this is not a detraction, just a bar for potential.

												Let me start off by saying I am a huge Call of Duty and Battlefield fan. Now that being said I am also a big Arma fan and I own the original Red Orchestra. If you are a Call of Duty fan, you may want to rethink your battle tactics when it comes to fighting with your team. The biggest thing in this game that makes it fun to play is TEAM WORK! I mean, you can be a long wolf like a marksman or machine gunner, but if you want to get the full potential of the game, play with friends( if you don't have any on steam, make some, yeah I'm talking to you COD players). This game is a huge improvement over the original Red Orchestra, I'm going to name only a few fixes they have made. First, and most importantly, graphics. The graphics in this game are a huge improvement over the original, if you don't believe me go see an eye doctor. Second, the shooting mechanics. I don't know why but the shooting just seems better in this game maybe it's just me. Third, cover and mantling. Finally, A FPS that lets you actually take cover behind nearly any object, building, obstacle, and vehicle in the game. The mantiling in the game is amazing compared to the original in that YOU DON'T RUN OUT OF BREATHE JUMPING OVER A FENCE! Oh, and by the way, you can jump in this game(yeah I'm talking to both of you COD and Battlefield fans). Now let me say this, YOU WILL DIE ALOT(and I mean alot)IF YOU DON'T WORK WITH YOUR TEAM AND DON'T MOVE FROM COVER TO COVER! Stay out of the open and keep your heads down. Now there is one thing I forgot to mention to COD and Battlefield fans(if they made it this far into the review) that I think will make them want to get this game. YOU CAN CAMP THE ENTIRE GAME AND NOBODY(and I mean nobody) WILL EVER GET MAD AT YOU FOR CAMPING. In fact, if you hold a position down, you'll get a high five from the commander saying ""good job"", Because in this game(especially if your defending) camping is what happens. Overall this game is awesome and you should buy it(especially now since it's on sale, but go buy rising storm instead, it includes this game as well). I'd give this game an 8.5/10 and is definitly my second favorite WW2 shooter of all time(World at War still has that special place in my library).			",147,13,1,14,14,0,48

												I keep coming back to this game because it really is the best multiplayer FPS experience available.At over 240h, I only expect it to continue ticking up until Tripwire builds a worthy successor, because I can tell you no one else has. No over-produced, under-developed garbage here. This is the real thing. EA/Ubi/Acti ain't got nothing on this title.			",227,25,7,24,30,3,38

												This game is one of the best WW2 shooters i've ever played . The gameplay and the guns feel so good and smooth , i just love when u take down an enitre squad with an MG (MG-42 xD ) and just think what kind of power that has. And rising storm is a welcomed DLC to the game , screaming BANZAI !!!! TENO HEIKA in the chat while charging with your katana or bayonet is priceless . After almost 300 hours in the game i can say that i'm very satisfied with it so far . I hope they will add more stuff into the game besides that keep up the good work . 10/10			",37,0,4,0,2,0,3

Product received for free
												''Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad and Rising Storm, I only had a guest pass for multiplayer, Writing a reveiw for the guest pass multiplayer''  With very little I had to play, I would say this seems a very polished  FPS WW game. It was very much like Heros and Generals. Choosing a server ( witch you can pick through for map type and mods and ping wise that best suite you) you get to choose Axis or Allies. That is German, Japanese or USA...and as guest pass I was only able to be a riflemen in witch ever side I choose with the weapon rifleman layout of that side. From what I could gather and deduce... I would say playing games with certain weapons and soldier type you gain experaince to make those ''said'' weapons and soldier types to advance to gain better ones or traits and whatnot. The usual ''it gets better the more notches in your belt you got'' kinda thing. With advancements of Rank also im sure to unlock such traits and weapons also. I was not privy to any saving of my games and kills and such so I couldnt see how this worked out really. SO after choosing a side OR you could click auto if it doesnt matter to you and it will throw you on the side that you're needed on. With a simple rifle, sidearm and gernades you go through objectives and do what you can for that game type to win the game. Gametypes seemed to be a territory capture objectives or destroy them and being the defender or assualt(er) in thus gametype. Simple enough. Maps and game type are voted on during lobby matchmaking between whom is there. I usually went with the flow. Kindly I was able to complete the tuturial missions in this game even on guest pass multiplayer and greatly enjoyed the play by play teach style. You are a German in the tuturial being brought up to speed for the war. This game seems to have lots of hotkeyes to control little things like breathing while taking the shot, or stance or blind firing over cover. LOTS to learn so do the tuturials. What I really loved about this game, was the real, true respect and coverage of languages during the game to their sides countries and even music ethnicity vibe during the main screen to actual match playing.  It makes the atmosphere real and that the whole point of these WW games is to experience those cultures and war right???  Well if you want to spend the money on a game that is a step up and polished the Heros and Generals or other WW games Id definantly say get this one.			",77,12,0,17,2,0,18

Absolutely accessable to both the casual gamer and the hardcore nut alike. It truely has the scope and grand scale required to immerse you in world war 2 mayhem. Axis, Allies.My only request for the future is to add Brit and italian forces. Other than that, the large array of weapons, and intense action, bombardment and chaos make this game a classic world war 2 shooter for years to come.			",207,29,6,20,51,2,33

												The most realistic, unforgiving WW2 game out there. No crosshairs, no ""Killcam"", and no ammo counter. You have to physically open the rifle bolt or handgun slide to roughly check how many bullets are left. There is bullet drop and bullets will penetrate through objects and walls. You can manually select between automatic and semi auto fire. You can also adjust iron sights for distance and the iron sights actually move. If you get shot you have to stop and bandage or you will bleed out and die. Most of the time though one bullet is all it takes for you to die instantly. You hear your player breathing when you aim down your sights and the sights go up and down slightly in sync with your breathing, until you hold your breath. Some servers also do not show teammates names above their heads so you have to visualy make sure it is an enemy by their clothing. All servers always have friendly fire on. This game is not for people who get frustrated with realistic fps games. This game relies very very heavily on teamwork, so much more than in say any of the Battlefield games. If you love realistic WW2 games though then this is the game for you.			",14,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Extremely immersive, great sound and realistic graphics (though one could desire a bit more clean of an FOV), realistic combat (realistic objectives, one or two shots and you're dead, suppresion effects, weapon handling, no mini-map) plentiful maps and modes, including community made maps that are being awarded by tripwire (who keep updating this game with new content). Is very different from other shooters, so don't expect Battlefield, COD or even Arma. This game is not just about scoring points and unlocking stuff, this game is about taking it all in and actually feeling immersed.			",139,9,1,6,12,0,29

												There's something about this game that's just awesome. I keep looking at the Steam store and my library thinking, ""What else can I play that's similar to RO2?"" Sadly nothing else even comes close to scratching the itch. I wish more people would play this, but other than that I have not much to fault on this game. This game to me is the product of the PC Game mod culture and what type of amazing ideas can spawn from it. If you haven't played it yet, I'd suggest buying it, giving it some time, and learning what a real meaty FPS is. Oh and it's WWII!			",149,7,2,23,19,0,55

Being a soilder stuck in a trench as the Japaness are Banzi charging is amazing! I would recommend buying Rising Storm and Red Orchestra 2. Rising storm is American V. Japanes and Red Orchestra is German V. Russians. All have unique guns and maps. Rising Storm has a little bit better graphics than Red Orchestra. But Rising Storm on some maps don't get that awsome feel like Red Orchestra. I mean like running up a hill attacking the japanes is cool in all but when you running down a street and a russian gets on a DP and starts raining hell on you in a city warfare fight is just plane badass. Rising Strom has more of a jungle/damged island kind of map style when Red Orchestra 2 has more of a city/forest/country map. Rising storm there is more auto guns and semi guns and bolt action. Red Orchestra offers mostly bolt action and if you are lucky you can get a SMG or semi auto sniper or LMG you will mostly be playing with bolt action rifles. Rising storm is not for the players who like to rush like in Call of Duty. This game means you have to work together as a tea to fight the enemy. There is no man for his self in the game. You need to work together. This game has some of the most amazing moment of all games. My most favorite games of all is Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2. Gameplay 10/10 Players 9/10 graphics 9/10 guns 10/10. This is a buy if you ask me!			",108,5,3,4,4,1,5

												Played this game a while back about a year when it was free to play for so many days. I Did'nt yet get use to it but I like war games. Now that it's been sometime and now that I have played ARMA II all I can say is that the two games of a bit of a relation witch would be a simulation of real life. It makes you feel as if you are really there.If you liked ARMA II then you will love this game or if you like games that have a bite in complicated controls to make you feel more in the game.

												A very fun and enjoyable game, I could not be more pleased with this game. If you want action style gameplay play regular game mode, if you like realism like myself play on realism servers. RO2/RS's realism mode is by far the most enjoyable/playable realism approach I have seen in an FPS video game. Warning! This game is not in any way like the COD franchise nor Halo so if you are thinking that it might... you are mistaken. Note: There are bots to if you want to break away from the player vs player or have a few players and fill the rest of the game with bots.			",210,18,6,22,10,1,29

Pacific and Europe maps are just so well made that every type of a player (stealthy or aggresive) will find their place on any map. Besides the music is just so amazing, especially in Rising Storm. (listen for yourself and you'll know what i am saying)It gives so much atmosphere to the game, that you feel like you are there with all the soldiers!			",89,4,0,3,3,0,18

												Best WW2 game I have ever played.  I love WW2, and I am always looking for good WW2 games.  I started with Medal of Honor: Rising Sun on my Gamecube.  I can remeber always getting scared when a Jap with a Katana came out of the trenches running at me and I would either waste 2 rounds of an M1 Grand into them or half the clip of a Tommy gun.  I Remember that one US soilder that got attack by a croc, and wondered why the Japs never were attacked when in the water.  I also remember the stupid tanks and how hard they could be to destory.  I played it for 4 years with friends and thats what got me into WW2.  Later when I moved on from being a consel pleb and got my first PC,  I saw that BattleField 1942 was for free on orgin.  I played that for about a year and although it was really old it was kinda fun, and funny :D.  I played it many times with friends and we would mess around on it most of the times, but sometimes there was a time when we played it like it was real.  We would alway end up running at tanks with land mines either way and killing our selfs.  Then the day came.  The day when I saw this game, and I can say this. There is no WW2 game thats better then this.  I have played at least 4 good one, which 2 of I only remember the name of.  THis game make you feel like your there.  Your a US soilder charging up a beach into the heart of the Japanese defence, or a German soilder defending the father land form the Ivan scum of Russia.  It's like an amazing first person movie.  So real and if you have a good PC you can make it look amazing too.  Running to cover from the enamys MGs,  firing your gun like a crazy man after seeing there is a enamy around the corner or in the ditch you just jumped into.  You struggle as you try to get away from the bombardment of artillery.  You are always thinking should I pop my head out to take a shot or stay down and wait for the SGT to pop smoke so we can get out of here.  This game brings a live and imersive feeling to WW2.  You buy this game and you will be a raw recruit that gets 2 kill and dies 25 times, but after a few games you get better, and every game makes you a better soilder.  You will rise through the ranks of the class you choose and what ever nation you pick.  You will help lead them to victory.  Buy this game.   20/10			",41,0,0,4,5,0,8

												If you like highly realistic shooters, then you should definitely check this game out. There's singleplayer and multiplayer, but multiplayer is where the game really shines. The bot AI in this game is really bad, so if you are looking for a singleplayer experience, i can't really recommend this game fot you. If you want to play online, then i suggest watching a couple of reviews and gameplays of the game, because the realism might not appeal to everyone. it's a really unforgiving game, especially in hardcore mode servers. You die from 1-2 bullets, you get no kill cam, you have no crosshair, your soldier gets tired from running really fast, your vision gets blurred from explosions and supression fire very easily and snipers will kill you very often if you are not careful. There are many more things that make this game difficult and realistic, but i'll let you discover them. The game is meant to be played on hardcore mode, so i recomment atleast trying a few matches. It can be extremely fun and satisfying when you are winning, but it can also be very frustrating if you are losing. In order to win a match, a team must play together and have a good communication. It's also very important to have good and experienced player in key roles (commander, squad leader, Machine gunner, etc.) If a team fails to do these things, it is destined to lose, except if the enemy team is even worse in that regard. I also must point out that if you are planning on acting like Rambo- not using any cover, rushing and gunning down everyone, you will be killed countless times by snipers and you won't even get close to the enemy. All in all, I definitely recomment this game, but before you purchase it, again I suggest watching gameplays and read better and more professional reviews than mine. This is game that many people might not like.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm are both pretty good games.  They are somewhat hard and are aren't fast paced.  What I mean by saying fast paced is that you can't rush out and spray your weapon and get like 10 kills in under a minute like call of duty.  It requires more strategy a few shots and your dead.  The maps are big you have artillery and many classes.  I would reccomend this game to anyone who like semi realistic WWII/FPS games.  To be honest this game is pretty hard and you have to be patient and somewhat strategic to do well in a game.  But I would give this game a 7 or 8 out of 10.			",50,2,5,3,9,0,10

												A near perfect WWII battle simulation that deserves a place in every FPS collection. An extremely popular launch day was marred by various technical hitches but ALL of these have been resolved. Fans can look forward to free DLC, more maps and weapons and plenty of RO1 veterans waiting for you... A great antidote to COD; highly recommended.			",185,13,5,9,37,0,32

												Amazing Game that will leave you playing for hours and hours and not even notice it. I love the realism that lets you get into the nitty gritty of real world war 2 warfare. When your an individual soldier trying to when you get nowhere but when your actually working as a team and moving with your squad and charge eniemes and positions thats when the real fun starts once again just an amazing game and a great buy.

												Extremely realistic, squad-based, tactical-combat fps.  Sometimes you can bandage wounds, sometimes you can't.  Sometimes you can make a shot with a bolt-action rifle across 200 meters, and sometimes you can't.  Very challenging, but never boring.  Respawning is quick and the enemy is never too far from your spawn point.			",497,170,10,49,96,5,91

												I haven't had this much playing FPS games in a long time. You feel like cannon fodder and so you should, you're only a cog in the battle. The teamwork element is there, although often under-utilised. It's brutal, it's frightening and it's refreshing. For the price, you can't really go wrong against some of the other cookie cutter FPS experiences released these days.			",158,26,3,22,30,0,16

												The best multiplayer PC FPS of the past 10 years. Marred by a very rocky start (multiple bugs, some of which are still around), broken promises (to this day the game has a risible dearth of vehicles of all kinds, especially compared to its predecessor) and horrible developer PR, Red Orchestra 2 is the definitive proof that first impressions do matter. It is nonetheless one of the most authentic and thrilling infantry simulations I have ever played, while still retaining a good deal of smooth movement and playability. It feels largely like a proper FPS, unlike something like ArmA, though most of its maps can still be played in a similar fashion (with deliberate pacing and lots of caution). The engagement distances are decidedly shorter than the average milsim's (you're not going to be fighting anyone much further than 250m away), but it really does feels proper to the mostly urban Stalingrad setting. The closest equivalent in scope and execution I can think of is the Project Reality mod.But what of the game? A class-based affair in multiple gametypes, with most Russian and German WW2 mainstays very faithfully represented. The game oozes ambition and sports a plethora of small innovations (It takes playing it so you can believe just how organic, polished and ""right"" the always-on free aim system feels - do yourself a favor and play the game on Realism servers), most of which directly enable the game's very tense and kinetic infantry engagements. If you have any interest and appreciation for the FPS genre at all, it will be impossible to play this game and not bear witness to its constant displays of genius and obvious evidence of superior design and workmanship. If you constantly complain about the ""fact"" that every FPS ""wants to be COD"" nowadays, put your money where your mouth is and delve deep into RO2. You won't regret it - Tripwire gave the gaming world a diamond in the rough, and has mostly polished it into a shining gem of a FPS - An accomplished example of what PC gaming is all about.

 Best realistic multiplayer game ever!!!!!!  SINGLEPLAYER If you're thinking about buying this just for single player, well you shouldn't because AI are horrible and its really easy to finish both German and Russian campaign in one day because of the easy dumb AI & how short the story is. MULTIPLAYER Multiplayer online may be hard in the beginning because how diffecult and skilled everyone are. Once you keep on playing, you'll be wanting more and more and starting to figure out how to play the game just like everyone else.At first, you'll<Run and gun<Die<Rage<Still mad about how to use the controls<Not focusing on the objective<Lose match<Rage about the spawn time<Leave your squad to get killsBUT,later on when you get the hang of it,you'll start to<Get comfortable with the controls<Getting more kills than before by being patience by defending the objective OR  attacking the objective<Communicate with teammates<Check map once in awhile esepcially on communicating<Not running and gunning<Taking your time on reaching the objective<Die less than before<Focusing on the objective<Sticking close with your squad and not leaving them behindThis game is all about TEAMWORK and PAITENCE, not just RUNNING AND GUNNING.

												Up there when it comes to tactical shooters. It tried to strike a balance between fast-paced action and gritty realism, team reliance and individual development, polished spectacle and quick release. It fell short, but after what is now a year-long recovery mission, the game jumped from its 1 cent status on the humble bundle (a loss of $40, mind you) to what appears to a more stable build, an active community, and a great DLC to sport. 4/5.

												The currently best WW2 shooter out there in the shooter world.If you like realism and team-based gameplay then this is for you.The world is deadly and war is a gruel, gruel thing and that is perfectly shown to you in this game.Have you ever been really afraid of dying in a game? If not you will definitely be in this game while running from one cover to another and hoping that no one sees you and you won't catch a bullet because in this game there are not many second chances.The atmosphere fits perfectly together with the art design and the music.I'd buy it again every time and can only suggest you to do so but buy Rising Storm so you get both great games at once.See you on the cold concrete area of Stalingrad or the idyllic area of the Pacific asking yourself ""Where the heck did that shot come from???"" ;-)			",180,27,13,17,18,0,36

												This game is AMAZING. Let me get that out of the way. It's ultra realistic gameplay-wise, and has great graphics. Did I mention it's well optimized? Most systems can run it on high at a buttery smooth 60 FPS.Taking one shot in the wrong place can mean instant or slow and painful death. There is a small diagram in the lower left hand corner that shows where you are injured. Yellow is minor, orange is moderate, and red is severe. Like, if you have red highlighted injuries, you gonna die.The game takes a page out of Battlefield's book (or did Battlefield take a page out of theirs?) with the supression effect. When being shot at or around explosions and gunfire, your screen will become distorted and your aim will become worse. Makes sense. I mean, I'm being shot at. I'd have bad aim too.Only a fool would advocate the importance of K/D ratio in this game. You'll die more times than a white girl says ""like"" in her lifetime.Pros:Extreme realismGreat graphicsGood voice acting for Native Russian, Japanese, and German voices.Realistic weaponsRealistic damageExcelent control schemeCons:American voices just sound stupid. ""DON'T GET SHOT BAH TOJO BOYS"" ""FLANK EM WHILE HES DOWN"" ""THAT WAS FOR PEARL HARBOR"" Ugh. Please change it.German english voice acting is GOD AWFUL. That stupid high pitched voice you sometimes get makes me want to shoot myself in the mouth. ""IVAN! ZER! ZER!""Pacific campaign needs a little work.

												Red Orchestra 2 might have been a game that I knew nothing about a few months ago. I got it when it was free. Usually, those type of games don't pique my interest for very long; this game was an exception. I played this game so much, dying non-stop, knowning nothing about the tactics involved and the tactical incetivised community. When I learned these things, I came to appreciate this game which offers some of the most fun and hard fought victories i've had in any FPS. Its fun, i'd recommend it to anyone who tries their hardest to win. Its a brutal world war 2 game, and it has enough depth and complexity to keep me comihg back to it again and again.

												This game is for those who enjoy realistic shooters. It is a WW2 shooter with seperate Germany vs Russia and US vs Japan modes. This game requires team effort to win. I highly recommend this game.Pros-Player can be instantly killed if shot in vital area.-Player can bandage themself if shot in non-vital area before they bleed to death.-Realistic weapons with bullet drop, overheating, and individual mags that each keep track of how full they are.-Matches can have tanks, which are highly realistic.Cons-Some maps encourage one side to spawn kill until they win.-Servers can have bots, which are very dumb and very susceptible to lag.

												The Good: Realistic combat, and with the Pacifi expansion the game has found it's stride as a worthy succesor to RO. The Bad: The leverling/xp system is ridicilously granular, it will take ages to level all weapons to get all unlocks.			",278,81,5,27,68,4,73

												No multiplayer combat game has sparked so much fear, danger, and emotion before.The tanks are highly detailed with interiors unrivaled by anything I've seen save for Steal Beast.The combat is quick and unexpected. Who ever fires first wins and this is one of the few games where semi-auto and full-auto guns are not weaker than bolt-actions. This serves to make elite riflemen with fast firing rifles a huge threat. Cover and smoke mixed with company tactics are a must and each class has a purpose.The maps are amazingly well done. This is kinda where I get the emotional part from. The amazing sound track mixed with you and your squad climbing through the ruins of Stalingrad or the tattered outskirts of Tula as you avoid sniper fire and shelling really helps give the sense of loss that the Soviets faced. With once great cities being nothing more but shells.The Pacific front is also pretty fun but I personally feel the Eastern Front is the stronger of the two gameplay and balance wise.

												By far the most realistic fps, and maybe even the most realistic game, I've ever played. Unlike COD or Battlefield you feel constantly under threat, knowing that at any moment a stray bullet or hidden marksman could kill you instantly before you even realise what happened. There are next to no indications of who is friend or foe apart from the clothes you wear and what side of the battlefield you are on, with occasional hints at enemy postion on the map when recon is available. This neverending vulnerability forces you to act carefully and calculate every move. Simply running straight at the enemy as you would in other games will inevitably result in your death. Teamwork is key and is much more important than individual success. However, when it all comes together, the satisfaction is hard to match. In short, buy this game if you're looking for something brutally realistic but rewarding.			",76,7,0,5,10,0,3

												Such an amazing game, though it was hard to understand the controls because I just suck at video games this is none the less probably the best WW2 FPS out there and shows very good features that other FPS games have , such as realism. It is a very good shooter and is still very much enjoyable with its realism, in which games tend to go for what players want and make it more of an arcade shooter which is bad. This is a really good game and to play was very enjoyable and cheap to get!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Great game wasnt expecting this much of a game from the people who made killing floor but this is the WW2 you must play no other game has this to offer, Weapon Mechanics Excellent and a cover system to make things a bit more enhanced and hardcore which it is although not to mention we have Tanks so this will make the gameplay even more solid. Final Verdict personally i rate it 10/10 most of my ratings are positive cause i choose specifically what a good game looks like so... go on buy it!!!			",113,4,2,5,5,0,1

												Honestly, RO2 and RS are some of the most intense World War 2 games I have ever played, if not THE most intense. The sounds and visuals do their job perfectly, immersing you in the gritty battles of the German Wehrmacht versus the Soviet Union, or the Imperial Japanese Army versus the United States Marine Corps. Even though the gameplay can be pretty clunky, it never fails to be insanely immersive at times.+Pros:+Awesome sounds and pretty good visuals.+Huge maps, enough to support the 64 player battles.+Plenty of variety with different roles.+Fairly realistic damage. One shot to the chest and you're down, no hitmarker BS.+Huge battles that can last upwards of 30 minutes.+Tanks require crews to be operated.+Cover system.+Mod support.+Showing community love by adding in player-made maps.+Commanders co-ordinate with squad leaders, and squad leaders co-ordinate with their squad.-Cons.-The controls. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥-Whoever optimized this game needs to be fired.-NOT an easy game to run. AT ALL.-Some people tend to take this game WAY to seriously and end up making an♥♥♥♥♥of themselves.-Crashes. Alot.-Your weapon free-moves on the screen like an arcade game, which is annoying as hell.-Selling RO2 and RS seperately, but as the same EXE is idiotic. I.E. Buy RO2 and it shows the RS main menu.Was called Nazi scum by a Russian team member. Swapped teams to Russians and he swapped to Axis. Called me Bolshevik scum shortly after.TL;DR If you get it, be ready for a pretty unstable game, but alot of fun. Especially with friends so you can cease the means of production, or slaughter the Bolshevik scum together in harmony.			",235,18,4,12,12,1,8

Playing as the american make you feel like a badass when using the flamethrower class, while the axis like the japanese i just enjoy doing banzai charges, my favorite gun for the allies is the type 100. bolt action rifle are your safe bet, smg like the thomson or the mp40 is kind of avrage when it come to damge but the recoil is  high as f##k, alway use short burst and only spray in CQC, bolt action on the other hand are literally one shot like you defult sniper rifle but it is slow at reloading like all the gun i mention.can i run it?i just show sooooooo just deciderate: 10/10Pros-realistic-love the setting-decend looking graphic-64 players lobby (like battlefield)-each gun have their own unique cons-clunky movement			",55,0,0,5,3,0,0

												Absolutely stellar tactical multiplayer gameplay that shouldn't disappoint.In Red Orchestra 2, including Rising Storm, being a lone wolf doesn't really have any true advantage -- unless you're coordinating with your team by pulling some sort of solo flanking maneuver to catch the enemy off guard -- and even then it's best to bring a couple of squad mates with you.But that's just it. The multiplayer is entirely meant to be self sacrificing. Work with your team for your team. Use strategy and tactics to coordinate a highly effective assault on the enemy's defensive positions. Orchestrate the perfect defense against the brutal offensive attacks of your opposition and drive them from your territory.And if you want realism, well, this has realism. From the sounds of the environment, the background and from your weapon comes sheer excellence and real quality. When you take out a flamethrower and burn the living ♥♥♥♥ out of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you find that you are quite pleased to hear the screams of anguish and unrivaled pain from your enemy. Pros:-There's no 360 no-scope CoD retardation in this. -This is a gritty, tactical war game that depends on team work for success. -You can't throw a grenade across the map in this game. -You have to compensate for bullet drop by zeroing in your sniper scope. -You have to play smart by using the cover system to it's fullest. -You can't just run around like a mentally deficient derp and knife everyone. -Being suppressed really does something (not like Battlefield suppression where it's a screen blur and some dumb effect that makes your bullets shoot out at angles and miss.) -Weapons 'feel' proper and they have the right sounds. Cons:-Like all games that go off of maps, this needs more maps. Now, don't get me wrong, this game has a lot of GREAT maps, I just want like 200.-This is on the fence for me, but I've always liked the Battlefield spotting system. The spotting system in this doesn't display an arrow above the enemy soldier's head. Instead, it tells you the general direction the enemy is located.TL;DR -- This game creates the most perfect atmosphere that you immediately immerse yourself in. Every little feature from the sound of explosions to the screams of your fellow soldiers makes for an unbelievable, hair raising experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played some FPS so far, but I think, none is better than Red Orchestra/Rising Storm. Why is this? It has some really good tactic element which are placed together with a good leader system. The whole team is sepparated into squads, each with an own Squadleader, whilst the commander issues the over-all-orders. Also this system is quite easy to handle and allows tactical playing with total strangers quite easy.Also the setting in World War II and the use of authentic weapons gives you a complete different feeling like in games like Call of Duty. With many team members just having bolt action or semi automatic rifles there's no chance for rushing. You have to take care for everyone of your steps. Especially in realism mode which I really like.The graphics on the other hand aren't that good. Still nice to view, but there are shooters with better graphics. But those shooters going for the graphics and the always same quite dull gaming experience (I'm looking at you CoD series and BF series!) can't compare to this one in the gameplay.

												Red Orchestra 2 is what you'd call an authentic shooter: almost everything in this game can and will kill you. You can't run around soaking bullets like Mr. Clean's Magic Eraser, no no, one bullet can and will kill you. Your life expectancy is short and more often than not you'll be killed by someone you never even saw. Your commanders will force you to run to objectives like cannon fodder while you evade mortar fire and artillery rounds as you wonder why you're throwing your life away. Snipers will pick your friends off like sport if grenades don't get them first and your tanks will most likely drive over you as they try to take that bridge.You might wonder where the fun is in all that and the truth is that you would have to try it yourself. The sound design is fantastic, from the franctic shooting to the laments of dying men. The gunplay is tight with different classes to add diversity and the community is great. But the best thing, the best thing of it all is the sense of tension that not many first person shooters in the market can give you, not anymore.Good luck soldier, you'll learn to love your rifle and sweet, sweet cover.

Rising Storm (USA and Japan) and Red Orchestra 2 (Soviet Union and Germany)+Similar to Heroes & Generals, but no Pay-to-Win or cosmetic crap+Battles have up to 64 players+Squad system, spawning in and reinforcements (Faction's lives remaining) are unique aspects of this game+Maps range from being very small to being massive, same goes for time, 5-10 minutes to upwards of an hour for each match+Multiple class types, depending on the map (Riflemen, Sniper, Assault, Tank Crew, etc.)+Realism Play style (See ""The Ok Stuff"") eliminates the usual HUD for FPS games, has accurate recoil for weapons, bullet drop, sounds, and bleeding/healing +No spawn camping allowed, if you're in an enemy spawn, you get a warning to run away or you'll dieThe Ok Stuff=Basically every server runs the realism play style, thus you need a good PC to play this game. However, it's not a mod and is completely safe to run=It's either USA and Japan OR the Soviet Union and Germany, no other factions or combinations of those factions=Smoke grenades are held by squad leaders only, and they will either really help or really screw you overThe Bad Stuff-Only one game mode really, basically one team defends points and the other captures themThe Truthful Hard FactsAcquirement MethodSteam StorePrice Paid$4.99Multiplayer Match Time10-60 minutesCommunity500-1,000 players dailyThe Elaborate and Perplexing Scoring System10.

Prepare to be killed quite often and depending on your nature prepare to feel major frustration as well!! As you adjust to the game and release your self from the"" CoD / Battlefield franchise grip"" and into the mechanics of this game, with time it becomes quite rewarding!! You should begin as a rifleman and play this position for at least a couple of months to get the basic jist of game play and learn to aim and shoot in game.  And while your new and learning the game  your deaths arent as costly such as they would be playing a Squad Leader or better yet a Team Leader. Being that this game revolves around team work at the squad level in order to accomplish goals as a whole, it is wise to learn each position well before jumping onto an established server. The community tends to grumble when a sub par skilled player is leading the team to a Lose.  which brings me to the only frown i really have with this game..  The gaming community while having many great people who are very helpful in it , is full of people who talk alot of trash over the Voip system. it can get annoying at times. Thankfully there is the capability to mute players . I see this as a set back in a team based tactical FPS... but humans will be humans unfortunately and there isnt much you can do to change that other than running a private server. I suppose that is the case with most online gaming communities these days. I would definetly recommend this game. The more time you spend playing the more rewarding it becomes as you learn the maps and how to stay alive longer between each respawn. The gaming community is alive and strong . It is rare at any time of the day for me to be unable to find a populated server worthy of playing! So come on!! , Join the rest of us  and get in the war!! We got some territory to take!!!!  A few gaming  tips while you are a noob...1) dont throw nades til you actually know how to throw them,,,, all you will do is kill teammates. 2) learn to  differentiate between team uniforms and the way they hold their weapons when running. each team is different intentionally to help you . 3) look at your map often!! 4) Dont run into falling arty.... you are just wasting precious tickets!!  See ya in game!!!			",127,23,7,11,17,1,4

												Want to feel like you're in the midst of a deadly warzone, set in world war 2, FPS style? Then this is the current best, realism based world war 2 shooter there is. Absolutely accessable to both the casual gamer and the hardcore nut alike. It truely has the scope and grand scale required to immerse you in world war 2 mayhem. Axis, Allies.My only request for the future is to add Brit and italian forces. Other than that, the large array of weapons, and intense action, bombardment and chaos make this game a classic world war 2 shooter for years to come.			",207,29,6,20,51,2,33

												The most realistic, unforgiving WW2 game out there. No crosshairs, no ""Killcam"", and no ammo counter. You have to physically open the rifle bolt or handgun slide to roughly check how many bullets are left. There is bullet drop and bullets will penetrate through objects and walls. You can manually select between automatic and semi auto fire. You can also adjust iron sights for distance and the iron sights actually move. If you get shot you have to stop and bandage or you will bleed out and die. Most of the time though one bullet is all it takes for you to die instantly. You hear your player breathing when you aim down your sights and the sights go up and down slightly in sync with your breathing, until you hold your breath. Some servers also do not show teammates names above their heads so you have to visualy make sure it is an enemy by their clothing. All servers always have friendly fire on. This game is not for people who get frustrated with realistic fps games. This game relies very very heavily on teamwork, so much more than in say any of the Battlefield games. If you love realistic WW2 games though then this is the game for you.			",14,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's something about this game that's just awesome. I keep looking at the Steam store and my library thinking, ""What else can I play that's similar to RO2?"" Sadly nothing else even comes close to scratching the itch. I wish more people would play this, but other than that I have not much to fault on this game. This game to me is the product of the PC Game mod culture and what type of amazing ideas can spawn from it. If you haven't played it yet, I'd suggest buying it, giving it some time, and learning what a real meaty FPS is. Oh and it's WWII!			",149,7,2,23,19,0,55

												Never have I experienced war like this before. This is a great break from Call of Duty, Battlefield and really just any other shooters. Being a soilder stuck in a trench as the Japaness are Banzi charging is amazing! I would recommend buying Rising Storm and Red Orchestra 2. Rising storm is American V. Japanes and Red Orchestra is German V. Russians. All have unique guns and maps. Rising Storm has a little bit better graphics than Red Orchestra. But Rising Storm on some maps don't get that awsome feel like Red Orchestra. I mean like running up a hill attacking the japanes is cool in all but when you running down a street and a russian gets on a DP and starts raining hell on you in a city warfare fight is just plane badass. Rising Strom has more of a jungle/damged island kind of map style when Red Orchestra 2 has more of a city/forest/country map. Rising storm there is more auto guns and semi guns and bolt action. Red Orchestra offers mostly bolt action and if you are lucky you can get a SMG or semi auto sniper or LMG you will mostly be playing with bolt action rifles. Rising storm is not for the players who like to rush like in Call of Duty. This game means you have to work together as a tea to fight the enemy. There is no man for his self in the game. You need to work together. This game has some of the most amazing moment of all games. My most favorite games of all is Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2. Gameplay 10/10 Players 9/10 graphics 9/10 guns 10/10. This is a buy if you ask me!			",108,5,3,4,4,1,5

												Extremely immersive, great sound and realistic graphics (though one could desire a bit more clean of an FOV), realistic combat (realistic objectives, one or two shots and you're dead, suppresion effects, weapon handling, no mini-map) plentiful maps and modes, including community made maps that are being awarded by tripwire (who keep updating this game with new content). Is very different from other shooters, so don't expect Battlefield, COD or even Arma. This game is not just about scoring points and unlocking stuff, this game is about taking it all in and actually feeling immersed.			",139,9,1,6,12,0,29

												Fantastic FPS, best WW2 online FPS currently.  Game mechanics force at least a basic amount of teamwork.

Gameplay is fun, and Kills feel rewarding. just fun to play I would recommend this game if you want to get out of the Battlefield 4 and COD type of games.

												     This game brings the values of teamwork from Ost front and then some.It has the grapical capabilites to make it feel genuine. From bleeding to death to almost getting your head blown of by a sniper's bullet.       This game's aspect of being a man of war is very well executed. It has tank combat which makes you feel like you're part of the crew. Or that you have animportant job on the team. Like being a machine gunner. You differ from the team and you have an important job. This is by far my favourite game.The bad thing is the frame dips and lag spikes however.Be aware that this game is also CPU based.

												By far the most realistic fps, and maybe even the most realistic game, I've ever played. Unlike COD or Battlefield you feel constantly under threat, knowing that at any moment a stray bullet or hidden marksman could kill you instantly before you even realise what happened. There are next to no indications of who is friend or foe apart from the clothes you wear and what side of the battlefield you are on, with occasional hints at enemy postion on the map when recon is available. This neverending vulnerability forces you to act carefully and calculate every move. Simply running straight at the enemy as you would in other games will inevitably result in your death. Teamwork is key and is much more important than individual success. However, when it all comes together, the satisfaction is hard to match. In short, buy this game if you're looking for something brutally realistic but rewarding.			",76,7,0,5,10,0,3

												Solid World War 2 multiplayer action game. It is much more realistic than Call of Duty or such games and more challenging. It is nothing for casual players, but those who want tougher experience will enjoy this one.			",203,56,9,27,27,2,24

												Great hardcore game that gives you play for one of the sides in the Second World voyne.Germany and the USSR, the USA and Japan <(if you bought the DLC).Fans of this topic should definitely enjoy this game.Not the usual little geymlpey when compared with a series of code. In a multiplayer game, there are different classes, which as can be (but a little) pump.But there is a balance that is not it allows to all players in the team to play for one class, so you can play as the commander (or one unit or the whole army).Commander can give orders (eg map that must be destroyed).And I almost forgot, there is a mode in which you can drive a tank (there is a full-scale tank battles.).Generally a very interesting game, I advise everyone!

												Lovely game and frustrating as hell, but that's what makes it good. I'm glad I got it. Tripwire has never let me down.As of this recommendation, the game is bugridden and you got CoD/TF2 Deathmatchers just camping and not following orders. In a few months everything should be about fixed and the kiddies should have left already due to being too frustrated to continue playing so you'll have the hardcore/team oriented players still left.Plus the price might be down as well.The ""realism"" in this game is wonderful. If you get shot, you bleed and you have a few seconds to patch up before you die. You can dial in your range for your guns and weapon placements and everything just seems so authentic.The class limits help even out the game as well. You've got 1 Commander about 4 Squad leaders, Numerous riflemen, 1 - 2 Marksmen as well as others. Maps are large and expansive. You'll get shot at from distance a lot while traversing the battlefield.Buy it once it's cheaper.			",135,12,2,20,10,2,21

(Sometimes too realistic)The single player is really short as this is mainly a multiplayer game.The online experience was good until the japanese sequel arrived.

												Red Orchestra 2 is a good fps game, lots of weapons,  a leveling system. The game has many great ideas to add to fps games and most importantly, is great fun. I would recommend anyone that likes a realistic or ""hardcore"" shotter but there are some problems you should be aware of. Half the maps are wonderful for camping, relistic game mode which is the only type played on severs makes smg and auto-matic weapons extremely strong, the game has issues with prone movement when colliding with the environment and i have encountered may werid bugs with RMB and the Shift key. The mutleplayer game is very unfriendly to new players and you will have to learn the maps and game the hard way by dieing alot with is very annoying.But overall I have enjoyed the game greatly and it should be picked up for $5-10 when its on special which it is offent.

												This game is for those that are tired of ""run and gun"" Call of Dutys and want some hardcore realistic action. This game doesn't go as far as the ARMA series in terms of realism, but instead does it perfectly, combining realism and fun. Ontop of the exellent stature the game has, the community is amazing, where people actually play the game for it's realism instead of ""run and gunning it"". What makes this game different, is that you have to take cover. No other game will you find people actually taking cover, because of the realistic bullet dammage. For crying out loud, you even get PTSD and shake when you're under fire for too long. There is unrealistic game modes, but the game's main focus is realism.Did I mention free maps and guns dlc from the devs every year... This is my all time favorite multiplayer game. Buy it for the experience of playing an actually good FPS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lets take a look at most of these game that are FPS and claim to be realistic games. They tend to normally be a bunch of players just running around clueless shooting everything they see. Theres no teamwork, little strategy..This games is far better than alot of the 2013-2014 main name released like bf4 and the cod's. Not graphically, but in terms of gameplay and realism. I honestly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good realistic challenge, working in squads of players who play the game tactically. The ingame voice quality is not the best ever, but is still very clear and good.I recommend looking at some footage on youtube .. search for ""Red orcestra 2 multiplayer gameplay"" and see what you think.

												The game is absolutely fabolous. The atmosphere is Top-Notch, and at the same time this is very cheap compared to AAA games. I can not however call this game flawless, as much as i love it. The game has a lot of bugs and weird glitches, noone game-breaking however.Gameplay - The gameplay is absolutely Top-Tier, however, you DO want to go to realism servers everytime, as the game is NO fun without it. The game encourages the use of cover and terrain, instead of just bum-rushing into a flamethrower. The game also incorporates a morale sort of system, the only system to date that allows suppresing fire to be effective, by making your character♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants when large amounts of bullets or mortar shells fly past them. Looking at a dying comrade will also make your character react negatively.Sound - As an essential part of the atmosphere, the sound is very good, so you definetly do want to get a good headset before playing this, to get the full experience. When hiding in your hole or trench you will be able to hear the bullets whistling over you, as well as the sound of the machineguns firing in the distance.Graphics - Due to being run on the Unreal Engine, the game has decent graphics, but nothing to write home about. The textures are pretty ugly, but as long as you dont specifically look for texture flaws, you wont notice at all. The game is beatifull, as the maps are very well designed with flora and terrain.All in all this game is a must-have for players who want a great game with a higher focus on realism than their average CoD.8 out of 10.

												Very realistic WW2 shooter. If you are used to arcade shooters like cod and such, you should try this game with an open mind. Once you know how to play this game well, it is very satisfying to kill someone as every kill is very rewarding that requires skill and patience. Love this game!			",73,4,3,4,6,0,7

												Red Orchestra 2 manages to straddle that fine line between semi-realism and gameplay. This is one of those rare and excellent Second World War shooters to play. It is highly thrilling, tense and satisfying. Weapons and bullet drop are represented impressively and the sense of accomplishment from survival and completing objectives make it worthwhile.An authentic level of vulnerability, tension and stress makes the game harrowing. It is rare to find a game that almost captures the brutality and intensity, but I find that Red Orchestra 2 comes quite close.Athough not perfect, with several awkward flaws (weapons unlock and casual modes) and rough implementation (campaign mode), for someone like myself not inclined to shooters I cannot seem to figure out how Red Orchestra suceeds. Teamwork matters between the commander and squads while caution and bravado occasionally nets results. I am not sure I will find another game in the future as compelling as this, in an age of shooters too afraid to offer tactical depth at the expense of accessibility			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 is best experienced in multiplayer. There is offline play with bots but they're abit wonky and need improvements..They'll run randomly in aimless directions sometimes.Aside from that, Multiplayer experience is awesome as you really need to work with your team to hold/capture the objective. It is much more intense than the offline play with bots. You'll find that supressing fire works really effectively in providing support. Artillery strikes are also incredibly useful in halting an enemy advance and can totally decimate an entire squad in the area. Smoke grenades are a great for flanking or doing a charge.Great multiplayer experience (+)There are alot of maps available to choose from (+)Multiple classes to choose (+)Numerous gamemodes (+)Realism (+)Bots in offline play need improvements (-)Weapon variety is a little lacking (-)			",136,16,0,24,14,0,8

												Red Orchestra 2 / Rising Storm is as real simulatorMost shooters these days are fast and no time to chat or make a game plan on how to capture this objective. Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad is the opposite of that. It has squads you can join with all your friends, become commander and squad leaderThe game is extremely realistic. All the tanks driving in the dista itnce, explosions at the horizions, bullets flying by your head nearly killing you. how much more real can get to a war simulator.

												Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad. A hidden jewel amongst the vast array of FPS out there.Where to start? The game either has you play as German or Soviet during Operation Barbarossa: the German invasion of the Soviet Union during WWII.Multiplayer is the vital component. While there is a singleplayer part I have yet to get to it, mostly because the multiplayer is the very epithome of fun, balance and technical brilliance. The latest patch added a beautiful netcoding tweak: player side hit detection. You can play with 220 ping and it does feel as if you have 20-40.BEAR THIS IN MIND, THOUGH: This game IS HARD. You are not meant to withstand an insane ammount of punch, nor are you able to survive against truly insurmountable odds. Expect realistic bullet trajectories, realistic sound effects, realistic hit detection and thus realistic healing.To sum up, it is a hard but deeply rewarding MP experience, one you should not pass up.COD & BF killer. Get it. 5/5.REVIEW UPDATE: The Rising Storm expansion is neat, arguably the best WWII Pacific Theatre FPS out there. Get it too, for it is a refreshing change of scenery and gameplay. The free Island Assault update added a brand new map to said expansion and some other changes, worth checking out.REVIEW UPDATE 2: The April 21st 2014 update unleashed tons of free content, including new vehicles, a brand new map for the Rising Storm expansion as well as tons of changes, among which optimisation and various balance tweaks shine. The sheer love the devs keep pouring into this game, constantly expanding the experience, is paramount in making this game the very best FPS MP experience out there.			",242,21,5,25,27,2,77

												Can't say I have ever played a better FPS shooter, or, at least, a shooter that has given me this much appreciation towards it. RO2 is by no means a normal FPS, it is hard, it is intense, and it is realistic. You'll find yourself mercilessly get killed if you are only just jumping in, and it doesn't take too long to realize the game requires you to play smart, calculatively, and, most of all, as a team, to do well. There is no room for those who play twitch ""I shot you first I win"" or lonewofl FPS players in RO2.It's hard for me to actually write a review for RO2 now what I got this far, simply because the game is just simply matching my taste in FPS, and that should actually be what it comes down to if you're trying you decide if you want to buy this game. If you think you'd enjoy a realistic, difficult, and challenging, but a rewarding, fun, and intense game with emphasis on teamplay and strategy, I want to say that you will almost certainly enjoy this game. If none of those sound like the type of game you'd enjoy, and you prefer games like BF3, COD, or CS, this game either isn't for you or will be a rough transition.			",120,14,3,12,14,0,19

												This game has given me the most harrowing experience in my whole career.I was running through a set of factory doors and was faced with a Russian who I shot in the stomach.He hadn't died.He shuffled around gun in one hand, the other clutching his stomach. He was screaming ""Mama... Mama..."".After what seemed like an eternity he collapsed and died.What had I done?I screamed through my mic, ""You Bast****! You have taken a boy away from his mother!  He didn't deserve this!""I went nuts, I ran through the doors, took aim and shot at 3 enemy soldiers. Then I fled.Perhaps in another life I would have met him on better terms, prehaps swapped pictures of our families, children, lovers or greeted him with drink or bread in hand, instead of cold german steel.

												On release the game was a disaster and extremely disapointing.But now it is the game it should have been on released. It is always great and challenging with large player amounts and some of the maps are brilliant as well.Depending on your play style, there is a role for you. The most numerous one are rifleman which are very efficent to use. Nothing is better then outshooting a LMG or a Assualt trooper with a bolt action.Rising Storm is also strongly recommended since you take part in the Pacific theatre one area that has pretty much mostly been ignored by the big dev's. Flame Throwers and Mortar men are incredibly annoying, but due to that using them makes a sense to get rid of them as soon as possible. My fav gun / upgrade on RS is the BAR with the Foregrip as it makes it a incredibly great gun for all ranges.The Unlock system on both parts is annoying and was not a fan of when first released, but now it is growing on me, due to have most of the stuff for the weapons unlocked now.Custom Maps are a must play for the game, as nearly all of them are great fun to play and better then the standard ones. Sadly though for maps Apartments (More or less Danzig from RO:OST) and Fallen Fighters appear to be very popular on vote servers, these are the two maps i dislike the most. The latter since it just allows easy camping. For Fallen Fighters try the map Streets of Stalingrad, since it is basicly a better version of it.I recommend this game strongly. If you are unsure about the play style. Get it when it is on sale, Be prepared to be annoyed to begin with, you will get used to it and take care, since it is not a run and gun game.

												Okay, so you are tired of those futuristic or modern military shooters? Your best choice is Red Orchestra 2. This game is so realistic, that in right server it feels almost like you're in real war. All this pressure builds up, when you're in a ditch and Soviet pigs are surrounding you. That feel when you have last few bullets and your last choice is to grab that old Kar98 and use bayonette to protect your position. This game is most definetly the best WWII game out there and it builds up so much pressure in the right server, that after the first map you most likely will be exhausted. Oh and since it's complete realism, then even a single bullet to your knee might kill you, if you won't stop the bleeding fast enough. You can call it ditch simulator if you want, because it aint some CS:GO/CoD/BF or some♥♥♥♥♥♥			",403,89,14,50,30,7,57

												What is Red Orchestra 2? It's the higly praised sequal to Red Orchestra a WW2 shooter basied for realism. The sequal improves on the first in everyway weapons are balanced, maps are fair for both side (german/russian or american/japan) and it's an all around great game if you like somewhat realistic (1 shot 1 kill mentalilty for a majority of the guns) WW2 shooters.

												This game tries to be as realistic as possible in a war type situation. That means the soldiers will be screaming, dismembered, yelling racist comments, crying and bleeding to death while choking on their own blood. It gives you a taste of the horrors in war. If you get hit by a bullet in the head or heart you will die, if it's anywere else you'll either die or start bleeding out, so a lot of this game you'll be dieing and eventually through patience, accuracy and quick thinking the tables will turn. This game is set in world war 2 with fantastic terrain, the AI aren't perfect (bad reaction time but great accuracy). I've had lot of great memorable experiences with this game, many people would feel a sense of greatness in things they do or victories they've won. My favorite moment was when I had flanked an enemy machine gun post but if I started shooting I would be found and killed (plus I was already injured and would die next hit), so as the japanese I would die honourably. I decided to charged them from the flank with a grenade, I then dropped the granade at my feet as I was shot, my vision went blury as my character laughed faintly and bled to death, the grenade exploded killing 5 people and it was glorious!7.5/10			",51,6,0,3,1,2,3

												I just played this game for the first time, this year, 2016 and after few multiplayer rounds I have to admit that this title is one of the best fps games I've ever played. Specifically, as a WW2 themed fps, could be the best one around. It's a pity that when I used to be more active as a gamer, I didn't even knew its existence and used to spend my time with titles such cod2. I shouldn't compare it with other games, but if you want to feel how men used to fight then, you should get it.- large maps, not as large as BF's maps, but large enough- tanks- commander role available- realistic weapon reloads- bullet drop- fatigue- wounding- experience will slightly improve stats- no crosshair - not minimap resident on hudSome people would characterize it as hardcore. Anyway it's a perfect value for money.As a con,it could be a not very big community, browsing servers inside the game.			",96,9,2,6,9,0,3

												Although the graphics are underwhelming and there are a host of bugs, the gameplay more than makes up for it.  Coming from someone who used to only play AAA titles, this has quickly become a favorite of mine, and I find myself picking it over Battlefield and CS:GO quite often.  There is a steep learning curve, and dying almost instantly after respawning can be very annoying, but learning how to get good at this game is extremely fun and rewarding.    Also, please don't take the TL and SL slots if you're new to the game.			",42,0,1,6,3,0,4

 Best realistic multiplayer game ever!!!!!!  SINGLEPLAYER If you're thinking about buying this just for single player, well you shouldn't because AI are horrible and its really easy to finish both German and Russian campaign in one day because of the easy dumb AI & how short the story is. MULTIPLAYER Multiplayer online may be hard in the beginning because how diffecult and skilled everyone are. Once you keep on playing, you'll be wanting more and more and starting to figure out how to play the game just like everyone else.At first, you'll<Run and gun<Die<Rage<Still mad about how to use the controls<Not focusing on the objective<Lose match<Rage about the spawn time<Leave your squad to get killsBUT,later on when you get the hang of it,you'll start to<Get comfortable with the controls<Getting more kills than before by being patience by defending the objective OR  attacking the objective<Communicate with teammates<Check map once in awhile esepcially on communicating<Not running and gunning<Taking your time on reaching the objective<Die less than before<Focusing on the objective<Sticking close with your squad and not leaving them behindThis game is all about TEAMWORK and PAITENCE, not just RUNNING AND GUNNING.

												Red Orchestra 2 is a very impressive game that manages to capture what war is about while still staying away from ultra-realism. It has a small but good community, and the developers are pretty communicative as well. What started out as a rough clump, is turning out to be a polished diamond. Servers with bots(A.I. controlled players) on them are a bit too frequent though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun and very intense even for an fps, Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad and Rising Storm is one of the most realistic military shooter similar to the Arma seriesgraphic:Not the best but pretty to look at, some low end pc cant handle this game well even for me. Graphically not bad running on a unreal engine my low spec pc is capable of running this game aroundpotato (lowest as possible including resolution)min: 22avrage: 28 - 32max: 39 - 40awesome builded pc (maxed out)min: 64avrage: 75max: 80 - 85ganmeplay: One shot, one kill that is the type of game that its taking, i have trouble survivng by myself and when i do i've only killed one person while the rest of his teammate started riddling me with mg and bolt action round XD sooooo lone wolf is not a safe bet THIS IS NOT COD NOR BATTLEFIELD THIS IS GODD@NM WORLD WAR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WORLD WAAAR! the movement is clunky but you'll get used to it anyway because it's part of the game, it's trying to be as realistic as it can get. Playing as the american make you feel like a badass when using the flamethrower class, while the axis like the japanese i just enjoy doing banzai charges, my favorite gun for the allies is the type 100. bolt action rifle are your safe bet, smg like the thomson or the mp40 is kind of avrage when it come to damge but the recoil is  high as f##k, alway use short burst and only spray in CQC, bolt action on the other hand are literally one shot like you defult sniper rifle but it is slow at reloading like all the gun i mention.can i run it?i just show sooooooo just deciderate: 10/10Pros-realistic-love the setting-decend looking graphic-64 players lobby (like battlefield)-each gun have their own unique cons-clunky movement			",55,0,0,5,3,0,0
