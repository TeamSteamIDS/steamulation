												TL;DR Synopsis:  if you have an Android or iOS Tablet, get the game on there for 1/5th the price it is on here and it will have more content to boot!  Otherwise wait until this game gets picked up for a 80-90% off sale.Fun little game is good for passing.  I don't think this game is really worth the $4.99 price it's listed on here for the following reasons:1) Game is over 4 years old 2) is just the base game (I don't think it's been updated with any of the content that the CURRENT iOS or Android vesions have) so we are paying 5 times more for a port of the older version of a game that is on on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

												Fun little casual game of managing an airport with planes that need to land in a particular airport.  Match the colors and receive bonuses and don't let the passengers become unhappy.  I love the cartoony graphic design for this game and the way you can trace the paths of your planes so they don't crash into each other is easy, intuitive and fun to use.  Be careful though, it's still easy to crash.  Easy achievements as well for those who like to get 100% completion.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

Briefly: Flight Control is a decent, casual flight control simulator in 2D.Now, Flight Control HD has little to do with flight control. Surely, there are planes, helicopters and airports and surely, you don't want aviational vehicles to collide with each other. Other than that, it's just fun and casual management of emerging chaos in pastel colours.Planes on a plane!You do get to control colourful planes. They randomly appear from the edge of the screen (with a convenient warning). If you wish, a handy tutorial will show you the ropes, but controls are fun and easy: just drag a path for the plane with mouse. Ideally, the path would end up in an airport, because points are scored for landing planes successfully. Each plane has a specific airport to land coincident by their colour.You lose if two aircraft collide with each other. Since the game is in 2D this is hard to prevent for long.While waiting for the inevitable, you can speed up the game. Conveniently enough, if two aircraft are on a collision course the game slows down to normal pace and highlights the two aircraft.Even though this is nice, the highlighting backfires when there are many aircraft on collision course at once. It becomes difficult to see where the most urgent flying machine is. So you lose. And try again.Dispelling the illusionInitially I tried to do nice and pleasant-looking arcs and long-winded landings with the planes but I quickly noted that the planes can actually do 180 degree turns, which dissolved the simulation aspect.Still, with a large enough number of planes to control, it does become difficult to manage. Different planes travel at different, albeit constant, speed with many having the same airport to land in adding to the complexity. A single game lasts just a few minutes at a time.There are 9 different levels with varying difficulty (size, variety of planes) and even a couple with special features, e.g. wind that closes up certain airports. Special features are nice but they are only in place in few levels. There's a minor random element in most levels of slightly changing positions of the airports, of course coupled with a randomized appearance of planes.A word on music: there's the same jolly, easy-going tune in most levels. Just a couple of levels have a special tune to fit their special theme. While the song is fine, it curiously stops after a while and doesn't resume for some time leaving you alone with the minor sound effects of collision alert and successful landing celebrations. Which are fine. It just weirds me out that the music is off for so long.ConclusionsEven the nine levels do not last forever. There's content for a few hours of fun. For myself, 3 hours were spent on achievements, which were actually very well thought and enabled additional meaningful challenges. Then I spent an hour or so trying to beat my friends' highscores, regrettably without success. Consequently, leaderboards may or may not generate a few more hours of gameplay for you if you are so inclined.The price is pretty good but since it is already an older game (almost 6 years old as of writing this), I'd recommend getting it on sale.

												Planes and helicopters keep coming from all sides of the screen and you have to land them safely by drawing lines between them and landing pads/helipads.  The goal is to see how many you can land without any crashes.  Feels like gaming ""lite,"" and maybe the explanation for that is it's an iOS game.  I purchased this for the holiday achievement and I certainly would not again if given the choice.			",2958,1175,116,358,419,33,494

												Flight Control HD is a game that is so incredibly simplistic that it might have come out back in the days of Pong. It's a game where you guide airplanes and helicopters to color coded landing pads and that's about it. Landing your very first plane and your very last one will be exactly the same. The game never changes in any meaningful way and it shouldn't take you more than a couple of minutes to realize that it's nothing but the same simple grind from start to finish.The controls are made for a touchscreen but shouldn't frustrate you too much, the graphics are the classic mobile ones, not exactly ugly but very unfulfilled on a PC monitor.This is not a game you should buy, it might not be bad for those 30 second mobile gaming sessions but on the PC, on STEAM, it's just a waste of space. Really and truly a game to avoid and one I would have avoided if it wasn't for the Steam event achievements.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												Single mechanic, single-input indies--particularly not-so-glorified tablet games--are only as good as your friends' activity on their leaderboards.

A sequel, however, could be interesting, with the introduction of progressive difficulty level design, and the introduction of several other secondary time-sensitive moving parts to keep track of...

												Well “Flight Control” may not be the most engaging game ever made; but it is a fairly addictive title! It feels very much like a mobile/tablet game that would be perfect for a train journey! The objective of the game is simple land the various types of aircraft in the correct lanes while not having them crash into each other in the air… It may sound easy but when there are ten pink planes coming in and only one pink landing strip; let’s just say it can get a little messy! I was actually quite surprised how much I enjoyed playing this; I thoroughly expected to hate it… However, as far as casual coffee break style games go, this was really quite awesome!

												Flight Control HD is one of these games that I'm willing to try because it seems easy and fun. It's not my type of game but being older made me more open towards new genres. The first time I've reviewed it on Steam with a few words were in 2010. I'm not surprised that I had the game since that time: I was probably influenced by the cheerful screenshots.Your goal is to land aircrafts on the right path, avoiding also collisions between them. The more you advance, the more aircrafts you'll have on your screen, and the more difficult it will be to manage everything. Also, you'll unlock new airfields: island, jungle, snow (as part of an old Christmas stuff), circus (where you have to go through portals), etc..It's very fun and makes you very aware of what is happening on your screen: some aircrafts are faster than others and it may be a problem at one moment (if their paths are crossing each other). Also, they're coming from every part and they're also different: choppers, big aircrafts, biplanes, military jets, etc.. You can easily spot them because of their shapes but also of their different bright colors (that's also how you can spot the right lane to land). It's a true challenge to manage every one of them once your screen is full of them.Don't worry though for a collision, you're warned about them: the aircrafts are circled with red and you have, if I remember correctly, a little alarm going off. Also, you're warned from which side they're coming.With a perfect landing, you'll be rewarded by a text in different languages, congratulating you. Everything is done to make you proud and also to encourage you to keep the good work.The graphics are very colorful and simple and it's perfect for that type of game. Besides, the soundtrack is very cheerful.Flight Control HD is really a little good game on PC, even if I can see the potential of it on any tablet or mobile device. However, while the game is for everyone, I can also understand that some players will be frustrated by the collisions and the repetitive gameplay: you're landing aircrafts by making them follow a path, praying that no other will cross them unless you decide that it's worth a shot given the speed of each vehicle.I've played the game a lot for the achievements. I remember mainly one not unlocking despite being sure to have met the requirements but I suppose that it wasn't clear enough for me, or it was my English, or it was just the wrong use of words.As I've said, the game was released in 2010. The game is still fun to play today, however, after a little search, the PC version is the less updated: the Android/iOS applications have more content or were at least updated until 2015. The Mac version has an exclusive map too.I had fun with that game and I never regretted that purchase.			",852,759,11,38,65,8,71

												Some nice relaxing music but for what would be considered a casual game it gets pretty hectic trying to land everything onto the runway safely.  I will say graphically while not sporting complex graphics like many Indie games it is very nice on the eyes.  I also love the score tracking in many various ways and without this I would definitely not be interested in playing the game.  Now as for the cost of this game on Steam I don't think there is anything wrong with them asking for $4.99 for this game.  Did I pay that much for it though?  No.  I believe I got it in an Indie bundle of some sort.			",430,39,23,44,20,6,21

If you're just going after the achievements you'll probably have 11 of 12 after those ~30 min and ~30 games, which means your still 170 games away from that last achievement...All in all, if you have 30 min. where you want to play a small, simple, casual game, then this is a decent pick if you can get it 50% off.

												There is nothing at all good to say about this excuse of a game. Shame on me for thinking it'd be worth 1 euro to play it to get the steam achievement, here's the thing, it isn't. It's not worth the HD space it occupies, and for me to play it ever again, the devs would have to pay me for the trouble. It barely counts as a game of any sort, and has 0 challenge on it. On even the hardest maps i would have to forcefully quit, because boredom struck before any manner of danger did. I have to say, the best part about this game is that the quit button is visible everywhere in the game (i like to call that quality design in case of games like these) and it quits very quickly... no, wait, no it doesn't. It crashes when you attempt to quit the game, having me to forcibly end the process. #1 worlwide success? Sure, whatever you say.			",357,55,9,57,72,2,74

												As an ATC (Air Traffic Controller), I really enjoyed this game, even though 2 hours are enough to get all of the achievements, playing a decent amount of times on each level.The idea beyond this game is pretty simple : manage different runways regulating aircraft, taking into account their type (it means that they have different speeds : the largest, the fastest). You have to match the colour to land on the adequate runway, avoiding collisions. A safety net will trigger to warn you about a short term conflict so that you have enough time to react. Almost each level has a specific feature : wind, water, emergency aircraft (get out of its path !), stunt, ...Initially, this game has been designed for tablets, but the gameplay is fine on Steam, even with a mouse and a keyboard : drawing trajectories should not be an issue. Having access to leaderboards kind of increase the end game, but, sadly, at the moment, almost nobody is playing this game. At only 3,99€, I strongly recommend it !			",2018,791,54,234,211,19,303

												Combine very simple but still addictive gameplay with neat and simple graphics - Flight Control HD. It's quite a nice game for quick breaks. It can get repetitive rather fast but the replayability is quite high, especially when split into smaller, more frequent sessions. The game provides control schemes for mouse, mousepad and touchscreen gameplay, but I wasn't able to test touchscreen controls yet (probably the most intuitive way to play it). Just ""Drag 'n' Drop"" incoming planes to their landing site or let them circle while waiting.			",501,174,18,85,37,5,79

												Simple title ported from tablets, controls fine with mouse (or, hell, an art tablet - my uDraw is great with it). Early levels just have you landing planes and maneuvering them around one another to proper airfields, but later on wind, obstacles, and different objectives entirely (stunt map! get through the pylons - land a seaplane! etc.) change up the game after you've had time to learn the basics. Pretty fun and don't let the flight attendants fool you: don't drink and fly, no matter how much booze they offer.			",2445,961,89,309,287,27,386

												Flight control HD may seem a simple click and drag game, but really it is a metaphor for the insanity inherent in the failsafe nuclear attack system. During the cold war, multiple B-52's would be scrambled during a time of nuclear crisis and the crews of these bombers were trained to stop for nothing, even orders from supieror officers. As more and more planes must be dealth with, the general pointlessness and unreasonable precautions of the cold war are brought to mind. although the peacefull music belies the violent metaphor in the story, the overall message of this quaint indie game is indeed one of violence.

												I first saw this game on my friends iPhone and was surprised how much fun this simple game can be. Navigating planes to their airfield, without causing a crash sounds easy, but once your screen is filled with a good dozen different aircrafts, you start to get nervous as your eyes have to be everywhere.Not much else to do, its just for fun to see how good you can do, but a nice thing in between.

												Just played my first 15 minutes of it, and I was surprised at how fun it was!  So, I'm writing an initial review immediately and I'll update it later.At first I thought it might be too simple to suit me, but it got challenging VERY fast.  Plus, you can redirect flights as often as you need to avoid collisions.  In some ways this reminds me of some of those old Atari games but with a fluffy modern twist.I got it on sale and am very happy to have it.  I hope they continue to update it, maybe with additional modes and challenges.Update:  I've played enough now to say....this thing gets massively hard, FAST!  hehe  Nobody will ever accuse this game of lacking challenge.  This game will _break you_!  lol  It has leaderboards for each map too.Even the first map gets very challenging after 50 planes, and is rough getting over 100.  My high score is 150 and I'm amazed that I managed that.  I usually lose between 70-100.  I just finished trying the 3rd map, a 5 star map.  It started off slow and easy, and then it opened the mother load on me after about 10-15 planes.  Wow!  Talk about massive mega challenge.The only thing I would suggest to the Dev, is to add a 3rd speed which is 50% slower than the slow speed is now, that way we can really try and get strategic and micromanage our way through really heavy jams, rather than just saying, ""I always lose about here"".  That would be great, because as it is, you really can't get too far, unless you're an absolute pro at this sort of thing.Imagine playing Tetris and going from level 1, to 'Insta-Drop' in less than 5 minutes.  That's how hard this gets that fast.  Again, I still highly recommend this.  Very fun!			",86,8,17,3,19,2,15

												Flight Control is a very simple game: guide planes to runways and don't let them crash. It's not the best game for a marathon session, but this certainly isn't a bad way to kill a few minutes. Flight Control is really pretty tough, especially when you have over ten planes on screen and new ones keep inconveniently arriving. The game controls pretty well, though it's pretty obviously meant to be played on a touch screen. The graphics are crisp, simple, and good-looking. The music seems like it was pulled from an elevator or from some phone hold message, but it definitely works as background music and fits the slow pace of the early game.I grabbed this game when it was cheap, and I recommend you do the same. $5 is probably a little too much for it, but this makes a great $1-2 title.

												This catchy little game was first introduced to me on the iPhone. It seems to have recently gotten much wider exposure. The goal is to simply land planes, helicopers and so on at the appropriate runway at the various types of airports. Sounds easy, but its much harder than it looks. For a minimal investment this game will keep you playing for hours and hours trying to increase your crew status and landing more aircraft. Great fun!			",134,17,3,9,26,0,64

												A pretty crafty little game with a simple, but complex idea. At first you are like, ""piece of cake"", but then things start to get hectic, and you are using your reflexes and critical thinking to try and figure out how to land all of the planes coming at you. The controls are simple, click on the plane, and use your mouse to draw the flight path. If you are looking for a indie game to help kill time, this little gem will help do it.

												A simple little time-waster that gives you the satisfaction of playing a game, without trapping you with a multi-hour commitment. I do get somewhat annoyed with the inability to set a proper ATC pattern, with flight levels and approaches, but that's not the point of this game. It isn't a sim, it's just little pictures of aircraft zipping around, and you need to guide them home. Worth picking up if it's on a good sale.			",159,26,0,20,37,4,49

												This game is indeed very simple but I enjoy it. All you have to do is click on a plane and set a route for it to land in the runway but as you progres then the game changes pace. You will have planes coming in that you cannot change the course, faster jets, slower jets, wind direction and runway changes and in the end it becomes really hectic and fast paces as you try to avoid plane collisions (which leads to a game over). A fun indie game that is simple yet very addictive! 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Along with Rock of Ages , this has to be my one of the best steam games i have played in 2011. Players are given a map with a variety of runways and given the task to click and draw the flightpath of the constantly spawning aircraft to the correctly coloured runway. The game is very well presented in the style and music used and is again one of those games that is easy to pick up but hard to master , as you try to keep a eye on 20 aircraft at some points , trying to ensure they dont crash into one another.92%			",453,74,38,29,24,8,61

												I first saw this game on my friends iPhone and was surprised how much fun this simple game can be. Navigating planes to their airfield, without causing a crash sounds easy, but once your screen is filled with a good dozen different aircrafts, you start to get nervous as your eyes have to be everywhere.Not much else to do, its just for fun to see how good you can do, but a nice thing in between.
