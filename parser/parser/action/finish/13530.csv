												The last game in the fantastic Prince of Persia trilogy. This time, the game changes radically. Again. The new gameplay now includes elements of stealth and the ability to do more damage without being seen or heard. Exploration and making progress through climbing, swinging, jumping, sliding and wall-running are still a huge part of the game, which is awesome. They even added some chariot levels. But the biggest change and probably the most important is the appearance of the Prince's alter ego.The Dark Prince is manifested by an internal voice that speaks to the Prince... at first. The Dark Prince is cold, cruel, arrogant, and sarcastic, and attempts to convince the Prince that they are the same person, and that the Prince should strive to serve only himself, using the Prince's vengeance as a catalyst for his other emotions. On many occasions, the Dark Prince seizes control of the Prince's body and the Prince is fully transformed into a kind of hybrid sand monster with abilities that allow the Prince to pass otherwise insurmountable obstacles. While searching for the Vizier, the Prince encounters Farah, who does not remember him, and is surprised that the Prince knows her name. Despite this, the pair begin to grow an entirely new romance together.Yuri Lowenthal's soothing voice is back. The Prince would not be the same without it. Beautiful monologues scattered through-out the game make it so much more enjoyable. The music is having Persian influences, but is much more epic than Sands of Time. Epic as in a theme of grandeur and heroism. Majestic and impressively great moment that you are experiencing, with lots of well-done cliffhangers. I still like the original more than everything.Some of the characters are familiar to the player, others are new and provocative. But with no doubt, both look unique and interesting. The Prince changes his appearance several times, as the corruption keeps getting further. And eventually transforming into the Dark Prince. Besides that there are a lot of weapons, secrets, and other hidden items.The game looks fantastic, as it shows you the very roofs of Babylon and then down into the depths of the city's dry well. As well as the Warrior Within, this game has a secret ending. The good ending requires a bit more effort, but it's totaly worth it.Solid gameplay, amazing music and voice-acting, great and intruguing storyline, with lots of plot twists, and nice looks. The last part of this trilogy really mixed all of the best from the previous games. Thus creating an incredible game that feels great.10/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ahh Prince of Persia. Assassins Creed's older acrobatic brother. This game is great. Youve got combos, sick acrobatic puzzles, and time control. TIME CONTROL! Wanna cheat death by rewinding time to get out of a bottemless pit? easy. messed up a stealth kill on an eenmy and wanna second chance? hit that R button. there are some annoying points though. Some of the jump puzzles are devious. But overall, this game is definatly worth a playthrough. dont even mind the crap graphics, about 5 minutes in, u wont even notice. and besides, its better to have a great game with crappy graphics *cough, zelda, cough*, then a 1080p game that sucks♥♥♥♥♥ *cough, COD Ghosts, cough*. So go pick it up and get your prince on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												what it could have been and what isKindred Blades could have been the wanted continuation of Warrior Within, instead we have The Two Throneswhile TTT is an excellent game it's a wrap up of the Sands of Time which I found out to be somewhat a let down, it backed out form some of the most interesting concepts from Warrior within:- it's again a linear game instead of the open space that Warrior Within had- there is only one ending instead of the two from WW- the grittiness of WW is gone, and we're back to SOT graphical style- the story is simplethere are some bonus though:- there is some more variety in the level design.- there is a somewhat kind of stealth, which is optional, and allows for some non linear gameplay, so you're not forced into the stealth.- charriot races, are cool but there are too few of them.- arab-like music again. much better than the rock from WW.- again two principes (like the sandwraith from WW)- interesting boss battles (although one of them is hard as f**k)it's interesting how this POP it's a middle ground inbetween the POP franchise and the first Assassin's Creed game, AC it's clearly a spiritual succesor from TTTbest to be played with gamepadthe game is completely enjoyable, play it you won't regret it.

												This was a huge favorite of mine back when it was originally released, so in spite of my reservations about haphazard ports, I was happy when this unadulterated version was released on Steam. As far as I could tell, it seems to be a pretty direct copy of the original. The graphics have been touched up a bit, but the gameplay, content, menus, and music all remain the same as they were a decade ago. Steam has this tagged as “partial controller support”, but aside from a few things on the menu, the whole game is controller friendly. How does the actual gaming experience hold up, though? The graphics are outdated, Ubisoft has moved on to bigger and bolder things with the Assassin’s Creed series, and many avid fans of our favorite wall-running protagonist would tell you to just stick with 2003’s seminal Sands of Time if you want the true POP experience. So what makes Two Thrones worth playing a decade later? There are a number of less important factors I could point to. The music is crisp, regionally appropriate (thank God), and diverse. The voice acting harkens back to the more subtle days of Sands of Time, and the schizophrenic conversations between the Prince and his dark alter-ego are funny, illuminating, and cleverly deployed in support of the game’s overall narrative. The boss battles are varied, make clever use of the game’s mechanics, and, particularly in the case of the final two fights, are truly epic in a way that was often missing in previous series installments. The game is linear, but within that linear construct, it offers you multiple ways to accomplish your objectives. And that brings us to the true strength of this game:Two words: visceral satisfaction. In other words, the quick-kill system. It sounds odd to say that a repetitive system of QTEs positively defines a game, but it isn’t the physical act of button-pressing that makes this mechanism tick; it’s how you get there. In Two Thrones, there are basically three options for combat. You can avoid large parts of it by just platforming past enemies and keeping your eyes on the prize. You can cover yourself in the blood and sands of your enemies by flinging yourself headfirst into combat,  where you can breakdance, roll, and slash your way to gruesome victory by means of the same combat system from Warrior Within. The final option, though, is the most satisfying, and the most clever from a game design standpoint. In Sands of Time, platforming and combat were kept largely segregated, and combat was just something you reluctantly waded through so you could get back to traversing the gorgeous landscapes. In Warrior Within, you were still frequently forced into prolonged moments of repetitive hacking, albeit with a mechanically improved combat system. In Two Thrones, however, platforming and combat are finally integrated, and dear lord are they integrated effectively. Instead of just serving as the means to getting from point A to point B, platforming is now also deployed as a way to get the jump on your foes. Instead of waltzing in daggers drawn, you can now climb above, around, and past your enemies in order to sneak up behind them, hear some satisfying middle eastern beats, and quickly dispose of them with some brutally efficient killing strokes. It’s difficult to overstate how satisfying this mechanic is. You will seldom feel like more of a badass than when you’ve executed a series of precise quick-kills to silently eliminate a group of enemies. I found myself replaying parts of the game just to determine how best to utilize the environment to surprise my unsuspecting sand monster friends. That thrill, that desire to maximize the glorious synthesis between your dagger strokes and your gravity-defying stunts, is what drives this game, as well as what keeps you coming back.

												The Silver Egg in the trilogy, the best of both Sands of Time and Warrior Within, minus a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of glitches WW had.So sometimes you change into the Dark Prince, like Dark Link, except he merges with you and has a nasty habbit of leeching your health, in which if you don't kill enemies and smash pots for sand every now and then you'll find yourself dead faster than you can say ""Remember that one part from WW where you were the sand wraith and thought you had to rush a parkour sequence because your life was ticking away every second but actually didn't have to because it doesn't kill you unlike it does in this game?""Yeah, thats always fun. Then theres some somewhat clunky chariot races of death straight out of The Prince of Egypt, except more death hazards and extreme faceplants into fortified walls. One of the new/best parts of this game is some new parkour elements, and stealth (sometimes right after a parkour sequence, for example: where you slide down a crevice and assassinate the dude while his buddy isn't looking with quicktime events varying in difficulty depending on how tough the enemy is). Instances of stealth can vary, but one of the most useful parts is the sand portals: Parkour and execute the stealth QTE right, or get a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of reinforcements to kick your♥♥♥♥♥for failing.Then one of my favorite parkour areas, the massive (probably shorter than Dubai's, LOL.) tower. In which you will♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants the first time one of the invisible enemies hit you.Assassinating enemies whilst on a chain as Dark Prince is always fun, and bosses are (mostly) fun and challenging to fight.So if you liked the first two games in the trilogy, this ones a no brainer.

Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones™Is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft Montreal. It was released in December, 2005 in North America for the Xbox, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and the Nintendo GameCube. It was ported to the PlayStation Portable and Wii, under the title Prince of Persia: Rival Swords with the Wii version utilizing the motion-sensing functionality of its controller, while the PSP version added exclusive content. A remastered, high-definition version of The Two Thrones was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on December 21, 2010.The Two Thrones marked the third and final chapter for The Sands of Time saga.GameplayThe game combines exploration and combat. Both elements make use of the Prince's acrobatic capability and agility. Throughout much of the game, the player must attempt to traverse the palace by running across walls, ascending or descending chasms by jumping back and forth between walls, avoiding traps, climbing structures and jumping from platform to platform, making other types of well-timed leaps, solving puzzles and using discovered objects to progress.During combat, many of the same moves vital to the player in other situations can be put to use to overpower enemies. An example is the ability of the Prince to jump off walls in order to strike enemies decisively. The player generally attacks enemies and blocks using a dagger, although other objects or factors, such as the Dagger of Time and its time-control abilities eventually prove to be critical to victory.In The Two Thrones, the Prince's acrobatic skills have improved and is now able to launch himself off walls at 45 degree angles at strategically placed vertical shutters, slide down chutes and balance on swinging poles, among other things. The designers have also improved the stealth system. Instead of merely being able to do more damage when striking without being seen, the game uses a speed-kill system. If the player does not complete the speed kill, the enemy knocks him off and the speed kill fails. The amount of moves or the length of time required depends on how strong the opponents are. The same system is also used in some of the boss battles.The Prince also develops a split personality, known as the Dark Prince, and this alter ego constantly bickers with him in his mind about right and wrong. At times, the Prince physically transforms into the Dark Prince. These transformations are scripted and not controlled by the player. During these times, however, the Prince retains control of his body, and the player still has control over the character. For the most part, the Prince's dark side is simply an inner voice.When controlling the Dark Prince, the player loses the ability to wield a secondary weapon, instead using the ""Daggertail"", a bladed whip fused to his arm. This allows medium range combat moves and new interactions with the environment. The Dark Prince also constantly loses health as a result of the semi-transformation, with eventual death from the loss. He goes back to full health whenever he collects Sand, from either a monster or object. Also, his Daggertail gives him a different button combination for speed kills, in which he strangles his victims. Coming into contact with water allows the Prince to return to normal.Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones™The game and Rival Swords have received positive to mixed reviews.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones is the third and LAST game of the sands trilogy (do never play The Forgotten Sands). It begins exactly where Warrior Within ends, so I recommend you to play, not only WW, but also The Sands of Time, because of the strong storyline connection.While the first two games of this trilogy are a wonderful masterpiece from the very first second to the end, in TT we experience a quiet slow and weak beginning, mostly because of the sloppy fights and small, uninspired scenarios.But the game will get stronger and more interesting soon, by adding brand new concepts and systems to the PoP series, like a satisfying stealth combat system, some funny chariot races, new platforming elements, and, what's more important, the dark prince as a playable character.As the dark prince, you will have more strength, more powers, new platforming abilities... It helps to make the game much deeper. Add this to great boss fights, excellente puzzles, some beautiful scenarios plus a full controller compatibility and 1080p resolution, and you have a HUGE game, with an epic and unforgettable finale.

												Probably the most enjoyable game in the PoP trilogy. It doesn't have as much combat as the first two and it allows you to avoid a lot of it with the newly added stealth kills. It mixes things up every once in a while with the chariot sections and the Dark Prince sections.This game has a weird place in the trilogy. Sands of Time had the most puzzles and Warrior Within had the most involved platforming sections, but this game doesn't really have much of either. It's a bit of a weird one in that sense because it's definitely the most enjoyable of the three, but it's the easiest and--mechanically speaking--it's the least interesting. Still a very good game, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I suggest using a gamepad as it will probably be more comfortable as there are times where you control the Prince and he might make the wrong jumps, (It might happen more often than you think so time them well.) The graphics obviously look like crap compared to the games of today but graphics doesn't 100% make a game and the gameplay is what makes the game, and boy does it not fail to dissapoint, to tell the truth ""The Two Thrones"" isn't all that different to ""Warrior Within"" actually it's pretty much the same, imagine putting ""The Sands Of Time"" and the best game of the series imo ""Warrior Within"" and that is pretty much it as they brought back the somewhat light tone of ""The Sands Of Time"" and kept what worked (Character Models,Grittness, Combat) in ""The Warrior Within"" there are new addition that were modified from ""Warrior Within) there was a more stealth style added which was a quick time event were you have to press the appropaite button to stealth kill the enemy as for the enemies if you're familiar with the POP series you know that as the game progresses so does the difficulty and the trap puzzles become more tricky.Like I said before if you wish to get into the Prince Of Persia series I suggest you start of with ""The Sands of time"", ""Forgotten Sands"", ""Warrior Within"" then ""The Two Thrones"" as it's order in terms of the storyline so you don't get confused.Overall Great game, Yes of course the graphics are outdated (since it came out in 2005) and it does have aging and bugs but it can hold up to todays games in my opinion as it doesn't hold your hand like SOME the modern games nowadays, but if you like games that are similar to this series like Assassins Creed (Also made by Ubisoft) Tomb Raider,etc. then the Prince Of Persia series is your best bet.

												Update: I had an issue when I was unable to slide down the chain with the Prince. This issues can be fixed by enabling V-sync setting form the option menu. After enabling that setting, you ought not have any more problems sliding down the chains.The visuals show the age of the game but the gaming experince is still good. The dialog is not great and the hero's voice is a bit annoying at times. Overall, I am enjoying the game.The game is buggy for WIndows 8. I am stuck at a stage where I cannot slide down a chain. Earlier in the game when the character runs along the wall, he just falls; I had to quit the game and start fresh to rectify the problem.  The camera angles are terrible but it is tolerable. This game is not playble for me until I have a patch for this game. Be careful downloading old games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PROS:+ decent fairy tale story+ two play styles (normal vs. dark)+ boss fights+ stealth kills+ cutscenes+ no uPlayCONS:- graphical glitches- the monster fighting gets repetitive real soon- TERRIBLY wobbly camera- often clunky combatComment:The final chapter of the classic Sands of Time trilogy which I played years ago. I would say it is the weakest game of the three but not terrible. The story is a mix this time, somewhere between the fairy tale story of the first game and continuing with dark tones of the second game. The combat is the worst it has ever been. I think mainly because they opt you to use the stealth kills, which are nice, but it makes actual fighting an annoying chore. The parkour isn't any better, flawed for the third time by the bad camera shifting that makes it easy to fail a jump or attack. The boss fights are nice but a real killer on mouse & keyboards so be prepared if you do not have a gamepad. The game runs fairly well but there is a glitch now and then. This installment is a middle ground of the previous two games and it shows. Sadly it is neither dark nor a fairy tale and even the gameplay is inbetween. This makes it rather mediocre but as the final part of the trilogy you should still get it ... on a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great end to the trilogy. I love how well the game ties in the other two to make this a cohesive trilogy because warrior within felt more like a standalone game rather than a sequel to the sands of time but this game does a great job of making all three games feel like one whole complete story. It tonally creates a world that fits both the two previous games by mixing some of the best aspects of the two like the princes personality, farah, the vizier and the overall persian feel from the sands of time while also having the violence and serious tone that warrior within had, it does it really well and it’s something that I don’t think is commended enough about this game. I really like the banter between the prince and the dark prince and kailenna narrating in the background during the game. I found the soundtrack to be lacking in this game, its really disappointing compared to the previous two soundtracks. Pretty good story overall, wraps everything up nicely. The platforming and gameplay is just as good as the others and its overall still an amazing game. 9/10 (Amazing)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones is the conclusion the the Prince of Persia Trilogy. The game maintains the same platforming and combat from Warrior Within but now adds stealth mechanics and additional platforming mechanics (wall jump platforms and additional dagger mechanics to stick to the wall and open switches). You also get an alter-ego side that during certain areas of the story you get powers to take out lots of enemies; these times really help by having fast paced combat and adds frantic platforming sequences. The areas and music are much better designed and themed than Warrior Within which really makes this feel like a true Prince of Persia game. The story and ending are a perfect fit to this trilogy. If you enjoyed the first two Prince of Persia games then you will feel right at home with this one and will go through a really fun and enjoyable game with an epic ending.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 Prince Of Persia The Two Thrones is a Action-Adventure Following the Closing of are Prince and his Battle against Vizier.The Gameplay in The Two Thrones,unlike Previous installments has you Driving Chariots in fast-paced action to get to locations,also,a main selling point,Transforming at points of the Game as The Dark Prince,Wielding TheDaggerOfTime in his Right hand,and a Chain in his left that he can Swing,Choke,latch,and Manuever with.TheStandardPrince is the same in combat,with the exception of StealthKills and hardly noticable New sand powers,with the exception of the Standard,Slow,Fast,and Stopping of time.Aside from The Bad Saving,it's a Solid Entry and a must for the Fans of the Series.The Story Starts Right where TheWarriorWithin left off,with The Prince Returning Home with his Love Kaileena,only to find his boat attacked,his City in War,and his Throne taken over by the Vizier.

												Almost everything in this game screams about a bad console port.The bad technical things:1) game doesn't start when run from Steam, you have to make the direct shortcut to PrinceOfPersia.exe and enable compatibility mode2) even then it starts only every other time3) sometimes the game infinitely loads a save and then silently crashes after some time4) Windows Media Center starts after closing the game5) often game doesn't respond to standard key sequences like Alt+Tab, Win+D etc. and always tries to restore itself to fullscreen state when minimizedThe annoying gameplay things:1) unskippable cutscenes2) weird camera movements - it auto-rotates according to the character movements(WASD) and ignores mouse movements, so you can't run AND look around at the same time3) in every menu cursor just jumps to the item that is most appropriate in developers' opinion. WTF, it's MY mouse and MY cursor, I decide where to move it!4) the landscape view is now available only at predefined locations - no more admiring the environment for you, playerHowever, the story is worth it. Definitely get this game if you're a SoT fan and/or played previous games.P.S. The best thing about old games - none of that online/Uplay BS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game since I finaly finished it in 2016. I played it when i was a kid but not to the end. So it was nice to replay the game and finish the interesting story. The Prince and his alter egothe dark princeare really well designed as characters.Pros:    awesome platforming with new elements nice soundtrack grafics are good after some fixes prince and his alter ego(storywise) videosquences good boss fightsCons:    models looking weird inconsistent safepoint distances darkprince combat and sections cameraangles finishing moves will mostly get stopped last sword is way too goodIn general the game is quite nice but it got some flaws. The progress between some safepoints are very different, so sometimes you don't see the end and other times you question yourself ""Why do I need to save here?"". I think the concept ofdarkprince is quite nice but combat is basically one combo and you will be forced to die if you don't see the path in the platforming part immediately. Also the camera angles are really annoying since you can't change'em to landscape view as you want(even Sands of Time does this better) and while running your camera angle get changed back to a fixed angle. That actually annoys and keeps me away from exploring the world, progressing and solving puzzles.Controller is recommended ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Two Thrones is a great conclusion to the great Sands of Time trilogy. The Two Thrones is set immediately after Warrior Within, with the Prince returning to Babylon on his ship with Kaileena. In the time that he was gone from Babylon, the city has been ravaged by war and the Prince finds himself in the midst of it. Because of the time altering events at the end of the first game, the Vizier is still alive and is on a war path. After some events, the Prince finds himself assisting and with the assistance of a familiar face, Farrah. Just like the first game, although she has no recollection of you due to the timeline correction, Farrah works with the Prince to hunt down the Vizier before he destorys the city. However, this time, the Prince becomes afflicted with some parasite after an intiial run in with the Vizier. The parasite transforms the Prince into some sort of Hybrid sand monster and he gets some new cool abilities, but at the cost of a really rude voice in his head.That's the essence of the plot without really spoiling anything.On the technical side, The Two Thrones plays just like the prior two games. The acrobatic elements are great. The combat is great. There are a few clunky areas, especially towards the end of the game, but the overall puzzle acrobatic design is great. The levels are well designed too, with an epic scope as far as how massive the rooms can get. It's an old game so I'm not going to criticize the graphics or anything. The music can get really intense and really raw, I was really digging it, especially in the last few levels where the Prince is on the final ascent of the main tower in the city.Basically, this is a really fun game and I'm glad I finally beat the Sands of Time trilogy.

												A very nice sequel to in the PoP Trilogy. Again, there are very nice parkour-parts and the new stealth element is great, as well as the story is.However, the combat system is quite crappy, but I recommend this game nevertheless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Masterpiece. Classic. <Insert other usless cliche here>This is the pinnacle of the action platformer (My love for this series keeps me from replacing assassin's creed as the pinnacle of action platformers, because really, it's a completely different type of game, and I love them both). No arguements. The final chapter in our nameless hero's journey is an epic one, and has very few faults. A truely outstanding game. Prince of Persia holds a very special place in my heart, I knew the first 2 minutes that I played the Sands of Time that I had discovered something truely remarkable, and the feeling lasted all the way till the final game. It deals with far more diverse topics then the previous two games, among them, the darker parts of the prince's personality. And the story is top-notch, a quality I've come to associate with Ubisoft games. This series is not one you should miss out on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The designers of this game appear to have conflated challenge with tedium.  Requiring someone to play through a set-piece combat sequence THIRTY TIMES does not make your game challenging -- it makes it boring.  What a waste of an interesting game concept and franchise.  One of the few games in my life where I simply became tired of the pointless repetition, and stopped playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Two Thrones keeps the enjoyable combat of Warrior Within while bringing back some of the charm that Sands of Time had. Add in the Dark Prince segments and you have a game that wraps up the trilogy nicely. Definitely my favorite PoP game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It turns out tampering with the timeline is not so good as it sounds on the paper. On his way home, the Prince was welcomed by a surprise party from India who decided the best present ever would be to take his loved Empress and turn it into the Sands of Time. After the extensive exposure to the magical sand and the vessel of the sand (He did knew Kaileena if you know what I mean), He got a bit schizophrenic, developing his darker alter ego, the Dark Prince. Go figure. A fine conclusion to the trilogy that left the throne to the assassains.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Conclude the story of our fair prince, after having come far and seen much, only to encounter the greatest foe that exists for him; more imposing than hordes of monsters, more imposing than the goddess of time, and even more so than an extra-dimensional horror that rips through time and space to hound him: Himself. The gameplay is entertaining, though, I found, easier for both combat and the puzzles, whiel offering a vast pool of great narrative and storytelling.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
