												i might aswell start this by saying, i was not happy about playing this.What got me excited about this gamewas that I've been looking for a nice FPS game for a while. I once used to play alot of First Person Shooter's, but went abit away from it, given i wanted to try out some other types of games -a choice i'm glad i made- but lately I've been missed it, so I asked around and some of my friends recommended this, so I checked it out in the store, and it was on sale at the time, so I figured, might as well give it a try.Storyline:Global Ops: Commando Libya is based on the typical evil communist/terrorist and good americans that's saving the world, this time they are stopping the Arab terrorists from getting their hands on- and using- an atomic bomb which will lead to a catastrophe, the idea might have the slightest potential, but they do not take advantage of that in this game, it feels abit like it's just shooting non-stop, dialogs is to be honest pretty bad too, i know that's not the main focus in a FPS(3rd person shooter in this instanse) game, yet i like when a bit of effort has been put into the storyline, so it's not too uniform,the AI is just terrible, even at veteran difficulty, at one point i got up, and slowly walked through a small passage with 5 gunmen shooting directly at me, without any trouble. oh, and when they realised just how pointless their shooting was, they saw it fit to run directly up in front of me, to block my way.and as the top of the iceberg every now and again glitches happened, and finally the messed up controls didn't help much.To sum up:I do not recommend this game, the AI is aweful, controls are bad (and can't be changed) and storyline is terrible. I give this game 3/10 at best i will not be bothered to finish this game given i have lots of good games waiting for me			",285,49,6,42,37,2,68

												Global Ops: Commando Libya is one of the worst games I have ever played. It's a bad console port with every single piece of gaming mechanics broken beyond repair. The shooting is bad, the movement is feels completely wrong, the AI is clueless, the graphics are poor, the mission design is uninspired and the storyline and dialog makes you want to play it with your sound and monitor turned off. Even the damn steam achievements are broken. STAY CLEAR AT ALL COSTS! DO NOT GO NEAR THIS TURD!			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												What can I say, I still bought it even tho the bad revieuws, because it was 2 bucks.For a game out of 2011 it is really outdated on all fronts, for the size of the studio it is okey.It is also very short I completed in 4.5 hours on HARD with all achievements. So do not spend more then 2,5 bucks max if you do not mind the CONS it is okey to play. CONS -Settings, only thing you can change is resolution thats it.-Controlls can not be set and you have to figure out yourself how to do what    * WASD walk    * SPACE Run, use cover, vault    * E Use (pick up guns/ammo/grenades) open doors    * F Melee (this is also you stealth kill)    * G trow grenade    * LMB shoot    * RMB Zoom/Aim  (in vehicle secondary fire)- there are 6 weapons, which is okey, except the sniper rifle you can not zoom in or out, so usually it is useless.- Your person sometimes does not go into cover where you do expect him to.- The game does not seem to responds fluently, at well- The AI is horrible, I did it on Hard(most diffucult) and the enemy just runs past you or stays in position(Not moving if you run past), it is just not HARD.- Your buddy is useless, he hits hardly anything he is either way behind or in front of you, lucely he does not die. PROS + Main story thought is nice+ Most vehicle parts are entertaining+ Achievements are clear and easy			",123,46,1,14,18,0,41

												-""A special kind of third-person action shooter: set out in breathtaking pursuit of dangerous terrorists!"" Bull. There is nothing new about this and it's only breath taking because of how BORING it is that you'll be wasting all your breath yawning.-""Diverse missions and a series of new assignments: complete all the challenges; action-packed Combat missions, stealth missions and hot pursuits in vehicles! ""Challenges? There are none. It's not diverse at all. Run in and kill everyone. That's every single mission. EVERY SINGLE MISSION. They are completely lying that there is any stealth.-""A massive arsenal of different weapons and vehicles: use all the means available to you to catch the criminals!""There's like six weapons. That's it and I'd hardly call that ""massive"".-""Hours of gameplay fun: either solo or with friends: complete 9 single-player levels and show what you’re made of in 3 different online Multiplayer modes!""Hours as in five. That's about how long the game will take most players. It's only taking me longer because of a lag/optimisation issue which results in a lot of restarts.-""Detailed graphics: fight in realistic settings from Greenland to Libya!""They're completely mediocre. Boring and bland. And so many boring hues of brown terrain.Well. That's me disputing the description. Onto the review.Finished the game on toughest or whatever and got all the achivements so let's start this trainwreck of a review.Let's start with the good. The graphics aren't terrible.The achivements are all relitetively easy.That's it. On to everything else. In otherwords. THE BAD.First for me is LAG. For some reason at least for me, It was horrifyingly laggy. everytime I tried to move the camera ended up with a huge lag spike. It finally fixed itself when I changed the affinity to two cores and back to eight while the game was open. Who knows if that fix will stick though.(Update. It didn't. Seems like it's a texture issue. A very poor one.)Facial animation. There is none. At all. If they speak it's a blank face. ALL THE TIME.That brings me to the next point. Voice acting. It's HORRIBLE. They sound bored and not at all natural. And even though the game involves a russian and libyan in a cutscene they both speak english with really poor accents.Weapons. They don't feel like they have ANY impact. It's like your shooting marshmallows. And on top of this the weapons themselves are kinda crappy for accuracy. Have an enemy a bit of a distance away? Be prepared to waste half your magazine hopeing that one of the bullets hit the enemy you're aiming straight at. Sniper isn't bad but obviously a pain in close quarters.The story itself. Completely and utterly forgettable. Bland and boring.A.I. - Utterly horrid. Half the time they just run past my ally and run to me. Sometimes they'll just APPEAR next to me. As you play harder difficulties the game doesn't make their AI any better. Just stronger weapons. That's it.In game dialouge. It's like they got a bunch of teenagers to write it. Every other word is either a swear word or a ridiculously stupid joke. It's not even fun to listen to.UPDATEThey didn't pay any attention to detail. There was one moment where I noticed that the character's head was the SAME height as the doorhandle. The couch nearby reached up to his waist. The turret gunners, if you get close to them you can tell that the character's are only standing there with their normal guns in their hands. There was no attempt to make it seem like they were holding it at all. There was a few moments where enemies came in a car and the door opened and closed. No one came out or anything. The four enemies just appeared outside it.There are some parts. The vehicle parts. They aren't nearly as good as some say. The enemies are hard to hit while moving and due to the lack of impact you don't know if you hit them. There is no on screen reticle while fireing in a vehicle aside from the first one. UPDATE.  When you're in a tank later you actually have a reticle.Overall. This is a painful experience that I urge no one to attempt.			",197,32,1,30,11,1,6

												Reviewing Global Ops: Commando Libya is like reviewing a trip to the dentist, if you enjoy a little pain then you'll enjoy playing this game.  Your mission is to take control of half a two man special ""special"" ops team as they make their way through 9 or so levels of corridor shooting one-dimensional gun play,  The action is experienced as a third-person cover shooter in that you must use the environment to avoid taking damage as you shoot the hordes of dumb ai controlled enemy soldiers.  You must run through various locations that are distinctly the same, moving from cover to cover, avoiding a barrage of shots that do not easily kill you (at least on regular difficulty) until you get to the end of the level.  There is barely any variation to the core gameplay.  In some sections you must avoid lethal fire from tanks, helicopters or hvg. machine gun emplacements [that you cannot destroy,] or the like, while picking up ammo and grenades from fallen enemies, until you find conveniently placed weapons at the end of a level section.  There are a few locations that require you to use some sort of heavy weapon to destroy a boss (helicopter, tank etc)Graphics are nothing better than okay, while music if fine.  The overall look and feel of the game is that it is something from the 1990s - probably due to the game engine being used.  Story and voice-overs though are bad, really bad.  I mean the stuff of bargain basements, not legend.  Truly the narrative is something out of a Hollywood Z-list action movie.  While the voice acting is just as bad.  Your AI controlled buddy is practically useless, getting lost most of the time or moving out of position into the area ahead where the enemies are pouring from but, without actually killing anyone.  Though he does chip in with the odd kill from time to time.If you are wondering if there is anything positive about the game its probably that you can use numerous guns, even if there is little to differenciate them apart.  Weapons include: UMP-45 SMG, M16+M203 grenade launcher, the latter of which doesnt work, AK-47, M1014 shotgun, frag grenades, M249 light machinegun, the Draguov SVD sniper rifle and M136 anti-tank/vehicle launcher. I still cant believe I am recommending it.  You maybe asking why... and how.  The thing is despite all the negative aspects of the game, it actually feels fun to play.  Yes the story is pants.  The audio amateurish.  Gameplay is basic but, if played in short bursts it can be mildly enjoyable in an old-skool kind of way.  I found myself smiling as my AI buddy and me took on hundreds of cliche enemies ala Rambo style.  I guess if you played games twenty years ago this may remind you of the titles of the same franchise and bring a smile of nostalgia to your face.Overall though I would only recommend getting this in a sale.  Its definitely a guilty pleasure.  Though the game is over quite quickly and is nothing special.  The ending is maybe worth getting too also. If you dont play it, you wont miss much.  However Im off to replay this on hard.  Pope if you're reading this... read a dictionary and learn to count past 10, you dumb s-o-b!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1. Enemies poppin' out of nowhere and melee you to death.2. There are some weapons like M16, AK47, UMP or M249 - doesn't matter, they all sound the same.3. Enemies are five meters in front of you without cover. You aim perfectly. You hit nothing. You're dead.4. You're lucky and kill three enemies in a row? Sound loop because there's also only one sound when they're dying. After that, YOU'RE dead because point 1.5. You reload your weapon - the magazine stays where it is, and the sloppy animation doesn't even fit.The list of negative aspects is nearly endless.Avoid this crap, Commander repeats: Avoid this crap!

												I was fortunate enough to get a key for this game, and based off its name, I was very eager to play it.  The game starts off with a small, but basic intro as to what you're doing.  Fortunately, the game has sub titles on by default, which I find to be very important in all games.  You don't get much information about your character specifically, which is a bit disappointing.  I'd like a little more background on the guy I'll be controlling throughout the playthrough.I use a DeathAdder mouse, and something I always do is change keybindings and make use of my side buttons.  To my surprise, GO:CL makes use of the buttons by default.  One button had been pre-assigned as my reload (which is VERY helpful), but the other wasn't given a function.  I'm really impressed that the developers thought ahead and considered users who have side/extra buttons on their mouse. On the topic of keybindings, I could not find an option to customize the keybindings.  If in fact there is an option somewher, I apologize, but it's not in the options.  I will never understand why developers don't include the options to change keybindings, especially in shooter games.The game is okay to look at graphically, but it's nothing amazing.  Some of the effects, such as explosions, look a bit too cheesy for my tastes.  You really start to notice the lack of graphic quality when you lok at character's faces.  In more than one instance, the face appeared to be too cartoon-ish.There is a take cover and roll mechanic, which is quite nice, until you realize the keys to roll are your movement keys.  There have been SEVERAL times where I've tried getting out of cover, and I'll roll away because roll is bound to the move key.  This is where it'd be incredibly helpful if we could rebind keys.Positives: Subtitles (and they are on by default) Side buttons on mouse automatically are assigned a function. A small, but good amount of destruction (can destroy doors and walls) Blind fire. Driveable vehiclesNegatives: No options menu when in game.  Have to go to the start screen. In-game music is on by default, and is a little on the loud side. No character customization. Can't modify the keybindings. There were a few missions where I'd run into invisible walls.  I'm not sure if these actually were invisible walls or just glitches. Bad voice acting. Bad animations. Mediocore graphics.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curators. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now, I don't know about you, but besides my love for artsy fartsy and 2deep4u stuff, I enjoy some dumb action and Hollywood homo-eroticism every now and then. And that's exactly what Global Ops: Commando Libya is. Only that it's a bad action movie. In fact, it's so bad that it becomes absolutely hilarious. The homosexual remarks between the protagonist and his companion (who sounds like such a twink that he could only sound more gay if he was drinking Fristi or something), the fact that one of the main bad guys keeps talking about how we will never get his♥♥♥♥♥ the almost insultingly bad accents and so much more. The game itself is gameplay wise a cheaper version of Army of Two with extra genericness, bad dialogue, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Call of Duty-esque storylines and gayness. Lots of it.The best way to have a good time with this game is to buy it cheap (I bought it for 1 key and consider that to be a fair price, considering the campaign takes about 5 hours to beat and MP is dead) and to laugh at all the awul everything. One of my personal favourite things to do was play this game and analyze it like it was all a metaphor for man looking for his partner of the same sex while struggling with the difficulties he faces in such a 'manly' world. The chopper would be a metaphor for his doubts about his sexual orientation, the fat Russian talking about how you will never get his♥♥♥♥♥would be a metaphor for all the potential sexual relationships with women he is 'throwing away', etc.In other words, it's great fun and the perfect thing to do when you're really bored and want to do something gay that doesn't involve other men or porn.And don't get me wrong. I'm not even against homosexuals or anything, but this game is probably the gayest thing to ever be featured on steam since Gone Home. That's just a fact.In a more serious note on the game itself: it's just extremely generic and since it's developed by a smaller studio, not as polished as generic AAA shooters. It's really the worst of two worlds, sadly. There's plenty of work put into this game, and I can see that, but nobody's interested in a generic shooter like Gonorrhea Flops: Cummando Labia, especially when you compare it to all the creative content smaller studios have created before in the indie scene.Overal, I can only recommend this game if you're the same type of person who plays stuff like Ibn Battuta for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles and you can get it for cheap.

												Its not very good. But there are a handful of weapons(8) and chase scenes. Overall the story is stupid and the rambo feel makes it just stay stupid. But not unfun, i guess.There are many bugs where cover doesn't work and you will get stuck but the checkpoint system allows you to bounce back and I was able to complete everything. The UI is minimal and you will often have no idea where your teammate is when he randomly yells ""follow me quickly"" but that could depend on how you play, i ran ahead a lot and I was pretty drunk.All the achievements work and it was an easy perfect game. For that reason, I recommend it... even if it is only a 22pt game. I've played much worse recently. The achievements forced me to use every weapon in the game, I enjoyed that.I will never play this again, but it fits nicely in my perfect game folder.			",674,170,29,114,120,3,131

												I got this game in a bundle at indiegala, and I didn't think it would be a good game, since I saw all the negative reviews, but I actually think it's a pretty good 3rd person shooter. Sure it has a few minor bugs, but they don't bug me. In fact, some of the bugs are funny. Most of the bugs are with the ragdoll physics, and your team mate randomly spawning in front of you out of nowhere if you go too far away from him. Here are the pros and cons:Pros: + The gameplay is solid, and it works.         + Cloth Physics, Water Physics and Ragdoll Physics.         + Destructible environments, and it looks good too.         + Vehicle sequences         + Controls are good         + Story is not bad         + Voice acting is decent         + Graphics looks ok         + Cover system works fine         + Multiplayer (I haven't tried it yet, but the game has it, which can only be a good thing)         + Achievements         + Sounds are good         + Game runs smooth, and doesn't crashCons: - No lip movements when people talk          - Game is a bit short, you can beat it in about 5 or 6 hours. My playtime is 8 hours, because I was afk.Overall, I enjoyed the game. If you are a 3rd person shooter fan, you should play this.8/10			",413,95,35,35,65,4,32

												""This would be a laughable tribute to Gears at Best!""When I first played this game, the first thing that came to mind was ""Hey that's not a B52 that just crashed! it's an Antonov  ... Russian not American lol"" so I'm letting the intro sequence play on and notice how funny the characters look and how they move.  The movement seems almost limpish as if everyone was limping which just breaks the feel to the game.  The action is mediocre wether you're using melee attacks to take out an enemy silently or the shooting aspect where you need to be in the over-the-shoulder view (iron sight) if you want to see the crosshairs.  Then there's the cover system which is hit or miss and just like in Gears of War; you will die quickly if you're not behind it.  The voice acting is sooo stupid it's beyond hilarious :) makes you feel like you're playing thru a parody of Rambo or Commando lol.  All in All, I cannot recommend the game unless you want to get a good laugh and a few thrills here and there			",733,223,21,122,77,6,110

												Global Ops: Commando Libya is one of those games where they try to cash in on a ""theme"", but ended up being ""overtaken by events"". The plot is as generic as can be: some bad guys found a nuke, and some tinpot dictator wants to buy it (for what, exactly?) and the good guys have to hunt it down. The plot's pretty interchangeable, and the things you can do in this game? They try to do a bit of Call of Duty type game where you get both third-person and rail shooter sequences, but not that interesting overall. To be honest, graphics are not that bad, but the result is you can't really tell where the ammo and such are. Also, while I like a commando who's properly armed (an assault rifle, AND a LMG? Please) the enemies are hilarious... As they are armed with... Apache gunships? and Blackhawk choppers? Shouldn't it be Hind gunships instead? Also, right at the beginning, they are showing an Antonov An-255 Mriya, pretending to be a B-52?!  This game is a generic shooter that was hastily put together to take advantage of the death of Moammar Ghadaffi. With that said, the game is below average. The levels are kinda... meh, feels like MOH redux (the EA revamp) but with clear levels instead of lots of up and down slopes and hints of ""uneven"" terrain. There are ways to flank the enemy... sometimes. You are limited to two weapons and grenades, but then, there only are like, well, M-16, AK-47 (or 74, can't tell), Dragunov sniper rifle, shotgun, UMP (submachinegun), and rocket launcher. There are attempts to make a cover shooter, as ""space"" is context sensitive enough to let you slide into cover and peek out and so on. Occasionally you get to use a mounted weapon, but that's about it. You do have a shadow... I mean a fellow shooter, who will tell you the obvious stuff like ""turn right here!"" or ""let's go through that warehouse!"" but he's actually impervious to damage. At least he will occasionally kill an enemy. However, he gets stuck on the weirdest things, then materialize out of thin air. AND he doesn't shoot the enemies that comes between you and him... and the Enemies mostly ignore him too! However, you have to follow him around, since there is no map, no nav marker, nothing. Only by following him will the plot advance. If you lost sight of him, well, good luck, but generally the game is a rat maze... single path. It will open a path for you if it appears you have nowhere to go. Enemies... Heh, you get everything from generic ""towelheads"" to generic ""balaclava goons"" generally armed with AK's, and only later you see some ""red berets"" (armed with UMPs? In Libya?)  and some security goons (wearing ""suits"") And they all sound the same and die the same... From a Russian renegade ship to deserts of Libya. And the random comments by your guys? Are just as bad, or perhaps, worse, as they seem to be written by some amateurs, who thought Rambo and Arnies are actually representative of US military, would write. And they *sound* that way too. ""Don't f*** with Pope (call sign for your character)""... Yeah, right. All in all, it's a cheaply made game, and at 2.50 it's... barely tolerable. You can find better games for that 2.50. And if it's any more, forget it.  ",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												It is not that bad, in the worst case is just a meh game.This game is like one of those old B action movies, imagine a movie with Schwarzenegger in Commando (1985) and Stallone from Demolition Man (1993) and that would be basically this game. So dont take it seriously and enjoy the fun  and one liners.The gamepley is a little clunky but nothing particularly difficult, is a short game you can complete the campaign in less than 6 hours.You can't remap the keys but you can use autohotkey key.

												just had a try of this see if it works before i shoot off to bed and can say it plays fine, controls are easy enough just needed to figure out what button did what as i could not see a controls menu on main screen or under options but it is easy enough to figure out w,a,s,d for up down left ad right space to jump/eneter cover  e button to pick up items or swap and open doors left mouse button fire right mouse button for sighting. graphically it aint amazing but good enough for £2.40. story is fine voice acting a little delay here and there but fine also. gameplay so far it looks generic but for a bargain price as mentioned no complaints. will be coming back to this soon.

												Game Play: Pure 3rd Person Shooter. Land Vehicle and Foot combat. 2 weapon limit + hand melee. No melee weapons.Map design: Very linear. However on some maps I had a hard time figuring out where the exit is located.How Long To Beat It: Around 5 hours on normalDifficulties On Normal: Everybody able to beat it on normal without much problems. Most can probably beat it on hard.Kids Rating: F Bomb in  every sentences. No nudity. Sexual innuendos. Violence but without blood. Bugs: None as far as I know.Game Control: Standard but space bar is use for cover, running, and other stuff.Save System: Check Point Only. Frustration on the check point system is very limited in the game.Option Menu: Very limited. No way to rebind controls. Very limited on video and audio. Recommend Buying Price: $5 or lower for everybody.---It's not a bad game. It is a pure 3rd person shooter. No puzzles, kill everyone you meet or moving. The plot is too stupid that it made it good. In other words you should not take the plot seriously and the writer intended it this way. In that regard, the plot is good for what it is, action comedy. Except for the two main characters, voice acting is so bad that it is good. You have to laugh at the bad voicing acting, which IMO is good for a game that doesn't take itself serious.

												Possibly the worst game I've ever played.To start off you're an American soldier who is fighting against Russians because they have, you guessed it, weapons of mass destruction. Imaginative. You're character has all the personality of a homeless man's shoe, and is constantly coming out with the most cliche one liners along with some awful original ones that don't make any sense... You don't have to announce a special delivery everytime you throw a grenade, dammit! Just be quiet and shoot the 'Ruskies'!It's a cover based shooter, which I guess would be okay if the cover mechanics weren't as smooth as the rear end of a porcupine. I'd love to be able to sneak from one bit of cover to another but he just stands up and strolls about as if he wants a couple of extra holes for him to go screw himself.As soon as I started playing it, I was already in a bad mood with it. This is because it throws you in, and doesn't tell you how to do anything. And yes, I understand that this is an occasional thing that happens in games, and I can alway go to the settings to look at the key bindings. Apparently not. The settings aren't available from the pause menu. That's fine I guess, I've just started so exiting the mission to go back to the main menu so I can see them isn't really a big deal. But when I opened the Settings Menu I had to ask... WHERE ARE THE CONTROLS?!?!?! It took me forever to figure out how to crouch, because it was the same button to get into cover, sprint, do a barrel roll, dance to the maccarena, high five the postman and murder my whole family, and if you are within a miles radius from a piece of cover you will automatically cling to it like Katy Price does to any tiny piece of 'fame' she can get her hands on. If I had a physical copy of this game I would not hesitated to set it on fire.			",84,12,1,14,4,0,23

												EDIT: PLEASE READ BEFORE DOWNVOTING, NUMBNUTS.PROS:- ""♥♥♥♥♥""; ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" (censored in Russian.) - Agonizing death sound by the Russians, ""♥♥♥♥♥"".- Voice acting and dialogues are blatantly profane and horrible yet extremely hilarious.- Extremely unlikable Amerikan protagonist Pope and his ugly comrade West curse each other like lowlife thugs; hilariousness at its finest.- In the beginning, the game doesn't know if it should be serious or not but as the game progresses, it tries to be stupidly vulgar and funny; it succeeds.- Possible to kill incapacitated Arab guy and fail the mission; such details were never expected.- Car actions in later chapters are surprisingly OKAY (no way it can be good but okay.)CONS:- Everything.- Pretty much everything.- Uninspiring story and setting.- Worst gunplay ever: gun sound, gun balance, obnoxiously inaccurate and underpowered guns.- You don't get to see that many Russians and thus have lower chance of hearing their agonizing voices and their ""♥♥♥♥♥"".Final Remarks:I had low expectations hence I got the game from Steam Holiday Auction; knew the Metascore and reputation of the game beforehand and thus it didn't strike me as something outlandishly bad. If you are easy to please and have played quite a number of indie games and other obscure and low quality shooters made from all over the world (especially from Eastern Europe), you may be able to tolerate and even have some fun in this game..

There's only 9 missions and nothing to do after that (no idea what the multiplayer is, possibly co-op?). It's dull and repetitive, the story is severely lacking and the voice acting is atrocious.Even if this goes on sale, save your pennies, it really isn't worth your time.			",635,128,21,80,44,3,79

												This is just what I was looking for. I wanted a cheap shooter that was fairly easy and fun, and this fit the bill perfectly. It is pretty generic and it is buggy at times, but nothing game breaking. It uses the typical cover shooter mechanics, and they all work pretty well. Sticking to cover and vaulting over it are both very smooth, which is more than can be said for many games like this.The story is bland and the dialogue has a ton of unecessary cursing, like it is trying to sound tough. But the action is decent enough, and if you find it for cheap, I recommend picking it up if you like shooting games.			",87,15,3,2,3,1,8

If you're looking for a generic 3rd person shooter with bad voice acting, bad vehicle controls, bad AI, but can squeeze a little bit of fun out of it, this is the game for you.

												This game lacks an intro by that I mean introducing the game and controls. The game lacks a crouch or duck button so to crouch you have to run into a object to duck which is a pain. The gun sounds sound very similar and when a bullet hits an object it blows up which real bullets down do. I do like how bullets hit small objects like a PC monitor they fly across the room but it days way to far. The game mechanics are great and when you get shot your characters' head decided to rapidly look up as if you neck flexes 90 degrees. If you some that enjoys shooting games this isnt for you. The price should be more than £5 coz your not paying for much and the specs make you think it will HD gameplay it is not i would compare the graphics on this game to Desert Storm 1.

												fast paced shhoter, simple plot with bad voice acting(funny as hell).  Cover to cover game play. Enjoyed the running and gunning. Recomend for the sale price. NOT a Blockbuster game but had a great time playing this low budget shooter.			",79,2,3,2,4,0,0

												This game is awesome. The frostbite 3 engine provides great visual effects , and animations. The campaign has a brilliant story with emotion evokiing qualities rivaling that of the walking dead. The MP is thriving. MP has tons of unlocks and fun gamemodes. 100/100This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't buy it.			",220,17,9,18,16,0,11

												This game is full of hilarious swearing. It's also really easy to get all of the Steam achievements for it. Otherwise, it's as straightforward as you can get for a third person shooter. Some vehicle combat sections are mixed in, which are well done, but otherwise it brings no unique ideas to the table. I would recommend this game to people who aren't cowards, and people who aren't afraid to play games on the hardest difficulty. Solid game. Try the demo if you're too scared to just buy it.
