												I played Space Siege as a result of a random Steam Roulette spin, and I was blown away by how great of a game it is!The game revolves around the invasion of a race of aliens known as the Kerak, who are bent on the elimination of the human race. The game is top-down, and plays somewhat like Diablo 3. The story is fantastic, with hints of Mass Effect, Dead Space and Deus Ex: HR. Those who enjoy those games will probably love this.The game is a little old, it was released in 2008, and the control system is definitely a little dated. Everything else is generally great, but if you are going to play I would highly recommend you ensure that you had a way to use the keybinds ingame (especially Map, Health Pack and ""Collect all loot"", these are imperative). Sadly, the game has no method of rebinding keys, so this might be a chore. I use a Razer Naga and bound the imperative keys to the sidebuttons and it worked like a treat.I can't emphasise this enough, this game is fantastic! It took me 8-9 hours to fully complete the game, while collecting the sub-story Data Pads, and loved every minute of it. Again, if you liked games such as Mass Effect, Deus Ex: HR, Dead Space, with the playstyle of Diablo 3, you'll enjoy this game a lot.Highly recommended.Nilesy			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Is maintaining your humanity more important than your life?Space Siege was a surprisingly good game. With fluid combat gameplay and light-RPG mechanics, Gas Powered Games managed to craft a unique but short story-driven experience. There are plenty of upgrades to pick from, and hordes of enemies to blast through. The combat itself is heavily action-based with little real strategy involved, and the more memorable aspect of this game for me was actually the choices between whether or not to cybernetically enhance myself. The game reminds you, in no uncertain terms, that enhancing yourself will make you vastly more powerful but that each enhancement will also slowly deprive you of your very humanity.So I ask you again: is your humanity worth dying for?

												I liked the Dungeon Siege games, so I wanted to give this a chance despite the bad ratings.After 3 hours in, I can not give a full review, but here are a few thoughts:- most generic setting, story, characters, levels and enemies I have ever encountered in a game- very very boring in every way- super repetitive gameplay, no challenge, no interesting/useful skills- bland shallow RPG elements, irrelevant skill tree ... there is only one way to use all the scrap you collect all the time, no real choices - annoying camera glitches- crashes at start until you find out about some additional drivers you need to install (actually an easy quick fix, described in the forum) Don't waste your time and bandwidth for downloading this, no matter how cheap it might become.

												No where near as bad as some of the reviews make out, Space Siege is by no means perfect, but is still a fun Diablo clone in space.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												7/10It's worth playing, the story and mechanics are pretty good, the big decisions will make you have to play differently, but lead you to the same places in the end. It's not bad but could use a little more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great top down RPG that reminded me of Shadowgrounds with RPG type upgrades.  The story is susprisingly engaging and while you don't effect the story a lot with your choices you do have a little impact. The gameplay is solid, the game never crashed on me, the graphics won't wow you but are not an eye sore. Overall it's a good little game. Doesn't break new ground but is pretty polished. Easily worth the $15 asking price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By the same guys as DS2 - decently fun gameplay, decent story (but has holes if you look too closely)I had fun, and don't feel my 12 odd hours where wasted.It is kind of hamhanded about loss of humanity, but eh.It was kind of fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ""You can’t always get what you want. But if you try, sometimes you get what you need.” At first sight Space Siege looks like a top-down shooter with interesting physical effects and multiple weapons you can customize. However, a closer look at these features reveals that there is only one melee weapon and the rest of your ranged weapons only differ from each other in terms of damage and firing rate (lacking tactical variety).The controls feel awkward and lack precision. In addition, the inability to change the keyboard mapping should be seen as a below-average gameplay feature nowadays.The characters are displayed in a stereotypical way and remain simple points of story related elements. Your only companion, in form of an android, will stay silent during your entire journey.Further shortcomings are the lack of side quests and dismal layout of levels. The cybernetic choices are a bit more meaningful, but its implementation feels rushed and unbalanced.Overall, Space Siege is a simple game with monotonous gameplay. It leaves too much to be desired, in order to be recommended. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements. Chronology: Space Siege (PC)Top-down shooter(Science-Fiction) – 2008			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game a long time ago and i only had to load it once to remember why i stopped playing back then.In the basics this is an RPG lite game. That means that it is an action game with some RPG elements like skills and leveling.In a way the controls feel like Dungeon Siege.Only that had a good story and never got boring..When playing this at first i was happy with the game.After a few hours things got really repetive and in the end i stopped playing and moved on to other games.The problem is that after a while you feel like there is no progress.Not in the gameplay and the graphics that are mostly made of the same textures and grey colours.Combine that with a B like storyline and i in the end couldn't care less anymore.It's not that the game is really bad but compared to what Chris Taylor has done before and after this game, it is mediocre and to simple.Go play the first two Dungeon Siege games, Supreme Commander and Demigod and you'll figure this out pretty quickly.I'd give this game a rating of 5,5 out of 10.So the conclusion is this isn't really a bad game.Graphics are decent, sound ok, the story mediocre and the gameplay is repetive. After a while you'll probably loose interest in this one and not return.I would really like to love this game because of the man who made it but there just isn't much there.It's your choice.You have been warned			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I decided to get this game despite the mixed scores. However, all I can say is that the game feels as mediocre as they get. Generic combat, generic corridors, generic enemies, generic humans vs aliens story. Most of the gameplay is an isometric shooter. Point at an enemy with your mouse and shoot. Seems like controls are simple enough. However, the enemies shoot back at you, and your only way to avoid getting shot is to roll dodge, and you have to aim it with the mouse in the direction you want to roll. So somehow you have to manage to shoot and roll dodge at the same time with just 1 mouse. And then we also get the annoying camera rotation, which is inverted. When I want to rotate left, it rotates right, and vice versa. Maybe there's a way to change this, but I didn't see it.You get a robot companion too, but it's just a regular sidekick really who acts as an extra gun in battle. You can give him a few basic commands, like attack, defend, and heal, and you can upgrade his stats just as you can upgrade your own, but there's nothing much else to it. You can probably play the whole game without ever using it.You can also get cyber implants and use skill points to improve your abilities, but it's all presented in a very generic and uninteresting way. Nearly every skill is a passive which just improves your damage or a critical chance by a couple of % and that's it. Not to mention, half of the abilities require you to have a specific cyber implant, and from what I've played so far, I've only found the one for the eye, so there are plenty of abilities in my upgrades menu that I can't use yet, and no idea when I will.The fact that enemies all look and act alike, makes every single battle feel the same. Throw a couple of grenades into the group and fire away till naught's left. Rinse and repeat. But then fighting enemies isn't so bad when you consider that 95% of the time you're walking and backtracking with nothing happening.You might enjoy this game if you're into dungeon crawlers with no story and simply need to play every single one out there, but otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it.

												Following all of the negative comments I see about this game, it exceeded my expectations.  It's clearly a Gas Powered game, remnants of the previous Dungeon Siege ""surprise mechanics"" are present though this is quite different in terms of combat as you're in full control rather than watching and managing.  I would have preferred a leveling system and random gear than the linear progression the game provides, that would have allowed much more flexibility though I can see where it wouldn't make much sense given how short the game is.  If I had one complaint it would be that the game feels like one big marketing campaign for the period sensitive Ageia PhysX, while that was entertaining at first there was so much of it that I couldn't help but think the game was made for PhysX rather than it being a feature of the game.  Nevertheless I'm glad I played it, it was certainly entertaining for the 10 hours it took to complete.  If you're a fan of the late Gas Powered Games then you likely enjoy this as well.

												Nice game for a weekend, if you're into hack-and-slash isometric genre =)Pros:+ Decent storyline;+ Two possible endings, depending on the player's choices;+ A chance to become an Eeeeeeevil Cyborg (""Resistance Is Futile"" (c));Cons:- Installation is messed up by Steam. The easiest way to cure, as was described by many people on the forums already, is to first download & install non-steam demo of the game (can be found for free on the internet - google ""Space Siege demo""). You don't have to keep the demo around afterwards, just launch it once then delete safely - its installation just includes driver package that the steam version lacks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
