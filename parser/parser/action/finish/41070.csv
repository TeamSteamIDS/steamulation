												""Over? Oh it's not over until I teabag every last one of you alien mother f***ers"" - Sam 'Serious' Stone, Serious Sam 3THE GOODThe Serious Sam series has always been an antidote to the shooters which may or may not have a player character who kills off people who are different to them because they look different, sound different and speak different languages, in where you have a whole lot of aliens trying to trample and shoot you from all sides, just like the 4:17pm on December 24th. There weren't any key card quests, no escort missions, and no real story which was involing in any way. The gameplay may turn off hardcore Serious Sam fans for the first few levels. Few enemies will attack you systematically while you kill them off in a straight line. After you reach the Shpynx however, it starts to hit the fans and the aliens who outnumber the amount of Steam gamers with light wallets will charge and generally blow you to pieces. Just like the good old days.THE GREATRemember when you realised that you could play co-op on some of your favourite games? It was the dogs ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Pretty satisfying) wasn't it? Whatever gamemode that has co-op elements in this kicks all kinds of alien♥♥♥♥♥ and there's nothing more enjoyable than decapitating a demon which you woke from it's slumber with something that resembles a laser whip from Star Wars. Be it Beast Hunt, Coin Op or just straight out Classic Co-op, it will be a helluva good time, especially with the customisation involved in it.THE UGLYCroteam, we love your level design. Serious Sam TFE and TSE were fantastic! We'll blame SS2 on the annoying child that kept pestering you on the next Serious Sam game who said that his father/older sibling played it and he wasn't allowed to. At least you regained your thing with the singleplayer in this. For the most part. The first few levels have you going through corridors killing off enemies not for fun, but simply because they're in the way. There is little reason to like the first few levels for many people, which will turn off some players. Later into the campaign you get cannons and miniguns and so on, so fourth, but here's a comparrison. In the first level of TFE, you get a rocket launcher, a double barralled shotgun, a single barralled shotgun, you fight off biomechs and witch harpies (If you find all the secrets at least). In the first level of TSE, you get a rocket launcher, both shotguns, a sniper, a chainsaw and a flamethrower while killing witch harpies, arachnids and lumberjacks with pumpkins for heads weilding chainsaws. And the best you find in BFE is a shotgun, some ammo for the assualt rifle and a few kleers and gnarrs? I know which I prefer. Also, a few mechanics like sprinting, aiming and reloading have been redundantly been introduced, but those are mostly optional, so not too bad.THE VERDICTOverall not a bad game. Worth getting on sale, but do not judge the game on the story and the singleplayer alone. If you get through to the sixth or seventh level, it will ramp things up a bit. And that's a promise.SIMILAR GAMES-Any first person shooter from Id Software before 1999-Painkiller and Serious Sam TSEFor more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview ",231,49,0,8,8,3,16

												The Serious Sam series is some of my favorite FPS games I have ever played. I played the first 2 when they came out and thought ""why don't more FPS games do this?"" Sending hundreds of enemies at you is extremely exhilarating. I never seen any other game do this like the Serious Sam games. You feel amazing as you try to dodge hundreds of enemies and their projectiles all at the same time.I always thought The Second Encounter was the best in the series, until I played this one. It feels a lot more modern and I love how the enemies look when they explode into bits and pieces. They got rid of the annoying trap rooms from TSE (I always thought they were badly designed) and upgraded the level design. The physics engine makes the majority of the levels have breakable walls. This creates some awesome gunfights, when you have tons of enemies blasting things at you and walls are breaking all around you while you try and shoot back at them.The Serious Sam series is also known for their final levels and just how brutal and awesome they can be. Over 1,000 enemies coming at you? Check. Nearly 2 hour level? Check. Huge boss fight at the end of the level? Check. Seriously difficult? Double check. I think this game has the best final level in the series. The music and enemy formations, just made everything seem so perfect. Good luck ever beating the level on Serious difficulty.This game will last you around 15 hours on Normal difficulty. There are other game modes you can play and the real strength of the game comes from playing the Campaign on Serious difficulty. Every FPS fan needs to try this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Genre -  FPS (nothing more, nothing less)Shoot Stuff, do a bit of jumping/collecting and shoot some some more stuff. This game is a straight up FPS in the style of Doom with supported local and network co-op. There are one liners and the creatures you fight add there own dark humour. You can play in short bursts and I haven't found it too frustrating as yet. Although if you don't play in co-op you will not enjoy the game half as much. Please bear in mind that the randoms who play online will probably vote to skip the story cut-scenes, as has happened to me on my first playthrough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When i first opened Serious Sam 3 BFE i teared up. It was such a beautiful moment that it took me back to the first time i ever played Serious Sam - a unique,unforgettable and exquisite franchise that got me into the FPS genre. About Sam 'Serious' Stone: There isn't much to be said about Sam Stone, except that he is a total destroyer of  Mental's world. His serious personality has inspired me for so long and now in this prequel of the first encounter i felt his anger and frustration in level 11 when his whole squad was wasted. Oops, spoiler i guess. Gameplay: You can start playing this game by choosing one of the 3 modes: Single Player, Multiplayer or Versus. For me the most memorable parts i ever had with this game were in MP. I have never experienced so much carnage and fun that can reach the ridiculous amount of 16 players in co-op. I personally reccommend that you join the steam group called '7smoke'  in order to enjoy online play without any speedrunners. There is also survival mode that throws you into a battle arena of countless waves of enemies. For those of you who enjoy playing solo, i must warn you. Don't click on 'serious' if you are a newcomer to the franchise. The final mode is Versus and for me this was a bit of dissapointment in comparison to the brilliant Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter versus. The double-shotgun is ridiculously overpowered, the maps aren't that good, a lot of rage quit and tons more stuff that annoys me, but still could be fun if you play with the right people. We must not forget that Serious Sam 3 BFE has full workshop support that has a lot of interesting mods from people that are really creative. So you can play christmas mods during the holidays, halloween events and etc. If you can't find the right map or character skin you want to play with you can create it yourself with the new Serious Editor 3.5. And to wrap this short review up i must tell you that Serious Sam 3 BFE is an easy 10/10 for me, but only because this is my childhood game and i love every addition to it. For newcomers that have never played Serious Sam before i can recommend this game with all my heart, and hope that this game will have the same impact on you that it had on me.  Stay serious folks !			",107,4,2,3,5,0,1

 Pros: GraphicsCombatWeaponryMelee executionsEnemiesCo-opMultiplayerSecretsSoundtrack Cons: None Personal opinion:  ""You may be big, but I'm SERIOUS!""  Oh boy, where to start? Serious Sam 3: BFE is an old-school FPS MASTER PIECE! SAM ""SERIOUS"" STONE IS WHAT EVERY OTHER FPS PROTAGONIST WANTS TO BE, BUT THEY CAN'T 'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT SERIOUS ENOUGH. I'm looking at you Duke, you're not the ""King"" anymore, actually you never were the king. SS excels at every aspect of the old-school FPS genre. It's got hordes of juicy enemies, loades of juicy weapons and loads of juicy secrets rendered in juicy graphics. I've used the word ""juicy"" too much haven't I? I WANT YOU TO GET THE POINT! Now... This is what you're going to do. You're going to buy this game, you're going to play it, you're going to fall in love with it, and then you're going to buy all the other encounters and play them too! And while you're doing that you can start forgetting about your friends and family, you don't need them, you have Sam. :)  Oh, it's not over until I teabagg every last one of you alien mother ♥♥♥♥ers!""  -Sam ""Serious"" Stone, my hero <3  Score: 10/10 ",27,1,0,0,2,0,15

												Is this another typical shooter? Yes and no. The game play and the art style does it's best to differentiate itself from anything else.I'd like to first mention the fact you can choose a third person view. This game does it's best to give you every option in the book and by simply adding this just means the devs care. One thing about the third person view, when the player backs up into a wall (not facing it), the camera switches to first person view. This is done I'm assuming so we don't get any camera clipping through the walls. It can be annoying, but some will probably find that brilliant. Whenever there is scenery that can break, or that gives a reaction back when hit, I'm definitely a fan of. Serious Sam has a lot of weapons, some that can be used with variance. The hammer for instance, can break through wooden planks or when X is pressed (on an X-box controller), Sam instead of swinging forward, does a whole ballerina spin to knock everyone out. If Sam hit's a wall, dust comes off it! Not everything breaks, but there is quite a bit you can hit and still get something out of it. Heck, if that sort of close combat melee isn't enough, when an enemy gets close, hit the A button to do a custom melee take down. You even get a trophy to throw once you do this. Weapons are somewhat basic but as the story line progresses, they do as well. All basic movements are given in this game which is absolutely fantastic (sprint, duck, jump). One addition that may have helped would be something as seen in Dishonored, where you can climb certain obstacles. Once in a while, you may find yourself trying to get up a stairwell you simply cannot. It may not seem obvious at first, but after multiple tries you finally realize you were maybe not supposed to go there. The enemies in this game are by far differentiated from the rest of the FPS world. My personal favorite is this guy running with two bombs in his hands, and yells at the top of his lungs as he is approaching you. Most of the time you have no idea where this guy is either than hearing his voice, and it's a scramble to find him. Blood type can also be switched in options. Don't like red? Go green? Don't like green? Go hippie.... (seriously). The game provides quite a challenge on one player and can be very fun on local-coop. Visuals and sounds are really good. The menu is easy to navigate and brilliantly done. The game's graphics are quite consistent and have not noticed any chopping. Sounds are welcomed as well as dialogue throughout the game. Sam does make a few comments here and there when seeing or dealing with certain enemies. My favorite part I must mention though is the local-coop ability. You can choose to play with 2-4 players and CHOOSE the screen sizes if you are playing with 3 people. Amazing feature once you start playing with friends. I recommend this game as it has local co-op and is extremely fun with friends. Alone, it can still provide entertainment and still worth a purchase. If this FPS had no local co-op it would be rated as an average shooter at 7.4-7.5. Because of all the added extras, I'll have to give itRATING : 8.1/10  Gameplay B Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BScreenShots : 3 player local co-op screens. The dude with the bombs yells at the top of his lungs while running towards you, kamikaze style Horizontal and vertical screens are available options, as well as unlimited or limited lives You can set these graphics as blood in-game, and change them anytime you'd like Various forms of melee are in the game, this is what happens when you press A near an enemy I wanted a vertical view, my friend said horizontal has better peripherals And then there are giants like this roaming around ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												Serious Sam 3: BFE+ The menus are accessible, the opportunities beyond the single player game are impressive, and the game runs smoothly throughout.+ (GRAPHICS) There's a sense of environmental deja-vu and less high-end beauty than in many of today's top shooters. But for monsters and monstrous levels of death and destruction, Sam 3 is where it's at.+ (SOUND) Great swells of industrial metal music, crazily verbal enemies, bombastic bombs, and audible gore galore. What's not to like?+ Serious Sam is a wave-based, run-backwards-while-shooting, roller-coaster of doom from start to finish. Variety is not its strong suit, but more weapon/ammo availability should be.Good old Serious Sam gameplay, with impressive graphics! Expect hordes of enemies and loads of co-op fun. For a real challenge, play on Serious Difficulty.			",122,30,5,8,9,1,10

												I love all the Serious Sam games to date, I used to play them as a child and really enjoyed them, thats why I have a lot of confronted feelings about this game, so here it goes:++PROS++-Mindlessly killing hordes of monsters is always fun-Not serious game/dialogue, funny one-liners--CONS---It gets TOO repetitive. Dont get me wrong, killing hordes of enemies is fun... but there is a point, where you are in a zone and enemies keep respawning, and killing them stops being fun an becomes a chore. Near the end of the game there is a section where you have to kill around 3000 enemies of all kinds, which takes you like an hour, all in the same place.-The enviroments: It tried too hard to have ""realistic"" maps, I mean, with a lot of detailed textures and real-world looking. In my opinion Serious Sam does good with less ""serious"" textures (which, by the way, dont look that good) and a more cartoony look. Half of the game seems to take place in the same city map and the other half in the same desert map.-The enemies: 85% of the enemies are the same from older games. This isnt a bad thing of course, but the new enemies they added are completely unoriginal and not fun to fight against. Alien soldiers that have human guns and just stand there shooting at you, also, they dont have projectiles you can dodge, but hitscan, which means that you cant dodge their shots. Wellp, imo that goes a bit against what serious sam is supposed to be.I had some fun with the game and enjoyed it at the beginning, but it got repetitive real quick and finishing it was kind of boring.Wouldnt recommend this game for full price.

 Serious Sam 3 BFE(2010). ""Alien Hamburger, my favorite""Serious Sam 3 BFE is a great game. You play as Sam Serious Stone. He's the ultimate 80's murican. An action film stereotype. Basically Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, & Bruce Willis combined! The title is serious, but the game is hilarious. Great one liners, a comical plot, and monsters that are just over the top. The game play on the other hand is seriously smooth & fast. They added aim down sites which is a must for me. Game play on a controller is excellent. The game features, single player campaign, split screen, LAN, and online multiplayer with 16 player co-op! This is the way it needs to be, hats off to Croteam. (I'm talking to you EA, quit forcing me to play on your server, and give me local co-op or LAN!) Sorry got off track, OK I'm back. The music is just awesome. Mostly Egyptian style background music, but when action gets heavy the music gets heavy. As in METAL. This fits perfectly for blasting Aliens into giblets! The Serious Engine 3.5 is optimized very well, while load times can be a tad long. I found this game would run on almost anything in lower settings (Not your RadioShack Tandy, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). If you enjoy a game that doesn't take itself too seriously, has a nice arcade feel, replay value, 80's action humor, and offers great co-op game play just stop reading and buy it!Disclaimer: Adult Content, Nudity, F-Bombs, Gore.

												Before the First Encounter (though Battle For Endor sounds much better!) is the 3rd instalment of Croteam's Serious Sam franchise, however, this time the Croatian guys picked the make-it-a-prequel-it-is-catchier road. To be honest, I have no idea what makes it a prequel - story-wise, you still keep shooting at various aliens until every one of them dies.The concept is similar to what Painkiller has: you walk / run along and enjoy the silence and suddenly you hear loud music indicating the oncoming hordes, and I mean HORDES, of enemies. Once you are done with all of them you can proceed to the next section - by only hearing your footsteps - where everything starts over.Your guns are big, using them is very enjoyable and none have the option to be reloaded. You just keep pressing the button until you run out of ammo. Oh, and sometimes there are bigger enemies that are meant to be the bosses. Simple as that.So, the core elements remained the same: it has always been a mindless shooter with Sam trying to sound as cool as Duke Nukem. My opinion is: sometimes he gets it right and sometimes he doesn't. Unlike previous instalments this game looks stunningly beautiful and even though it is already a 3-year old game it requires some high-end components so that you can enjoy the spectacle of blown up enemies and flying body parts!For those who love this genre (or more like: subgenre) Serious Sam is a must!

												If I had to describe my experience with Serious Sam 3 in a single word, it would be: ""underwhelming"".I bought Serious Sam 3 in the recent holiday sale and played it with a friend in coop from start to finish. Both of us having played every other game of the series, we relatively quickly decided that this part of the series is the least fun to date.The third installment is much more oriented after recent ""mainstream"" fps games, lacking most of the classic and iconic features, clearly wanting to reach a wider, more casual, audience.During the whole 7-10 hour playthrough, you will face the same enemies with the same standard weapons. They replaced classics like the double revolvers with a generic desert eagle, the tommy gun with an m4. There is absolutely no variation in locations, as the whole game is situated in egypt, starting in a destroyed city almost identical to what Battlefield 3's campaign starts in, and then leading to pyramids and ruins, all looking basically the same. The huge variety of level design, that Serious Sam 2 had, is completely absent, as are the very funny and unique secrets from the earlier Serious Sam titles. There are still secrets in the game, however, they are so boring and anticlimactic, that you just stop looking for them, while you were going through entire levels again just to find that one funny hidden easteregg in Serious Sam 2 or 1. The biggest thing you can find in SS3 are the sniper rifle and plasma gun (which are secret only, which reduces the weapon variety even more) or some additional armor. Serious Sam 3 just doesn't dare to stick to its roots, but rather wants to attract a bigger audience by making itself way  too serious . It almost feels like just another generic shooter. Even Sam's oneliners just seem off and boring in this game.They added melee executions to the game, which means you can run up to enemies, press ""e"" and instantly kill them with a short animation, which is fun at the start, but later becomes so spammable that it makes usage of weapons so absurd, because it takes much more ammo and time to shoot than to just one hit melee people. Bigger enemies cannot be meleed, and they usually stay back and spam you with infinite-range rockets or machine guns, making them annoying because you often lack effective long range weapons.Now, there are still good sides. The soundtrack is amazing, the gore is pretty nice and coop still can be fun. If you didn't like the ""ridiculous""-approach of Serious Sam 2, then you might like SS3. If you, however expect, a creative, crazy game, you will be disappointed, just like I was. The whole game feels like a drag, like one long-stretched level, as you walk from ruins to pyramide to desert to ruins to pyramid to ruins again, and then finally to an unsatisfying boss fight resulting in the ending credits. After two levels you have seen all enemy types, almost all weapons, and all mechanics. There are no vehicles, turrets, almost no jumping puzzles, just straight up walking and shooting wave after wave of the same, annoying enemies, always with the thought ""please be the last enemy"" or ""please let me exit this desert already"".I was really looking forward to playing Serious Sam 3, I went in with a lot of motivation and I really wanted to like this game. But instead of another fun installment, this just became a generic shooter, with almost no resemblence to the series, lacking so many iconic features. That is why I don't recommend this game to fans of the series at all. It is the worst Serious Sam game so far, in my opinion.Just a quick list of things missing compared to earlier installments:- multiple locations (--> also varying enemies)- unique bossfights- iconic weapons have been replaced with generic ones- unique and rewarding secrets- a lot of humour- varying gameplay mechanics, such as vehicles or turrets- power-ups (including the Serious Bomb)- puzzles and jumping passagesIt might still be a solid coop experience, but nothing more. Maybe people prefer the barebones version, that focuses only on shooting, but I'd much rather recommend SS2 or First and Second Encounter.TL:DR 10 hours of the same levels, enemies and weapons. Almost no variety and imo, the worst installment of SS yet, as it lacks almost all classical features. ",36,17,0,10,11,1,9

												Not too often game nowadays: hundreds of enemies with different behaviours and tactics to dodge, evade, and most importantly, shoot. “Serious Sam 3” really stayed true to first and second encounters with its big guns, huge bosses, hordes of monsters, bad-aѕs protagonist, large level with lots of secrets… Original “Sams” borrowed from 90’s classics: “Duke Nukem”-like hero, “Doom”-like gameplay. New instalment added some modern elements like iron sights, stamina-consuming sprinting, cutscenes, etc., but overall it is good old! And of course game like that has an awesome multilayer features: both coop and deathmatch modes are good to try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Latest Masterpiece by Croatian Developer Croteam. The first Serious Sam, well as its Second Encounter, had everything you could want in an FPS;an easy difficulty making you feel invincible - the opposite one teaching you to dodge in realistically deadly scenarios, intense and frantic action with beautiful and detailed level designs and atmosphere, and gigantic environments littered with some crazy secrets. I used to be a veteran player of Serious Sam The Second Encounter/Deathmatch/Coop.Serious Sam 3 is an old school shooter with fast paced action and hordes of enemies.Overall: Sam 3 is an amazing game from indie company-Croteam.This is definitely a good fps game especially for a Single player experience. This game still keeps its old shooter roots while adding few new modern features.So if you are tired of Cod or other modern fps try out Serious Sam 3 for a different experience.

												Why to this game — mind not to understand a plot. But it is: Earth was attacked by aliens, and now the terrestrial hero Sam needs to reach the ancient artifact found in Egypt to stop invasion. As BFE is the prequel of original game, Serious Sam: The First Encounter, we already know that will be at the end: our hero will be had to the past and will give to aggressors on Russian cabbage soup. But at first it наваляет it in the present — and there burn it all with fire. At first sight, game in comparison with the previous parts didn't change at all: Sam strides on absolutely linear levels, turning enemies into forcemeat and occasionally distracting on search of hiding places. Periodically the hero lock in the conditional room (""conditional"" because it can be and the huge plain) and fill up with tons of enemy meat. In the nature of things at the same time to turn aside from horns of a furious bull and at the same time to sit down from a double-barreled gun in a forehead to a skeleton. Pleasure, it is necessary to tell, not for all: if you grew up by Call of Duty, Serious Sam 3 to you hardly it will be pleasant. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).

												Unless you're a die-hard fan who yearns for new experiences after having played every other Serious Sam, don't get this.Buy the Second Encounter of the Serious Sam games instead.BFE adds features to the series like putting a dung heap into your favorite pie recipe which creates an extremely irritating parody/mocking of the previous games. These features include sprinting, ironsights, weapons that suddenly have to use magazines, hitscan enemys and a really bad melee system.Some small-minded fanboy might say that I have the option not to use any of these but it is clear as day other aspects of the game had been changed to fit around your great new ""features"".Sprinting allows you to walk faster forwards at the cost of not being able to shoot. Running and gunning always had been the core functionality of the game so this is a genius move. Optionality is not a counter-argument since enemy speeds have been increased to ""counteract"" the sprinting ability, making enemys such as Kleer annoying to deal with because they have 200 meter jumps which normally ended up in good shotgun range but now make a succesful dodge half as rewarding.Weapon magazines on the Tier 1 Shotgun and M4 are there to slow down your fast paced shooter and make sure you enjoy your time actively doing absolutely nothing.The increased amount/strength of hitscan enemys ensures your run and gun fast paced shooter turns into a blow-trading cover based waiting-simulator. While the previous games had hitscan enemys that would instantly shoot on sight but have poor long-range capabilities the ones in this game have to be baited to shoot after which you wait out their shooting behind cover until you can return fire. Rinse and repeat with a lot of waiting. Waiting is fun I enjoy it a lot thank you.The bad melee system allows you to instantkill certain enemys once you are close enough at the cost of being locked in a killing animation(it won't look satisfying the 2000th you do it I can promise you that). More waiting, thanks a lot. I would truly let this ""feature"" slide if it wasn't for the fact its the only way to get rid of the new giant bug enemy type which is merely a bullet sponge. It is less frustrating to use the melee instantkill on them en masse and works (it shouldn't) because their AI does not have a proper reaction to close quarters combat with the player.Graphics are grey, mediocre and uninteresting. Enemy designs have been reduced to tones of grey and red. For some reason the Doom mancubus is in this.On the good side, the second half of the game gets slightly better as it attempts to ape the previous games. If you can wade through the first half, that is.The music is also nice I guess.			",165,21,0,11,7,1,10

												I'm two minds about this. Some parts of this game were fun. Some parts. The others were not. If you're a serious fan of the SS franchise, you might want to convert this to a thumbs up.I expected a mindless carnage shooter and I got it, that part is fine. The environments could be a bit more varied, but it's OK. The enemies are fine. But the level design, oh my god. I'd love a corridor shooter (with actually wide areas, but linear). But in this case, you're constantly looking for something, often you don't even know what, and are just backtracking and wandering until finally you find a key or a switch somewhere. There are maze-like passages, often in a complete darkness (underground), where you spend an hour looking for a nearly invisible lever (honestly, I had to open up a let's play on youtube twice just to figure out how to proceed, in a game that's supposed to be a mindless shooter!). This was killing the fun quickly, I want to kill hordes of enemies, not spend tens of minutes wandering around looking for something. The humor could've been better, I think, there are just a couple of phrases throughout the whole game and that's it. The underground passages were extremely annoying and overused (once would've been fine). The ""space monkeys"" are extremely irritating (that is the point, I get it) and again overused, also kill the pacing. The performance is abysmal - I can play Witcher 3 but hardly play SS3?I think the full price is ridiculously high for this, I recommend you to buy this in a serious discount, if you want it. I enjoyed about half the game and suffered through the rest. Overall I was quite disappointed from it.			",138,39,2,15,10,2,31

												For each step taken forward, another step was taken back.Serious Sam 3, where do we begin with you? I grew up playing all of the Serious Sam games, starting from the very beginning. I've played most of the spin-off games as well, along with that god awful GBA port. I'll say as much; Serious Sam 3: BFE, is probably my least favorite game out of the main series. It doesn't mean it was bad, but it certainly needs a retrospective in the development of the next game.Serious Sam is, for all intents and purporses, a parody game of the gratituous action flicks of the 80s and 90s. Unlike Duke and his bravado of being an unflappable badass, Serious Sam opts to take a more corny approach. He comes off more like Ash from the movie Army of Darkness than John Matrix from Commando. Full of self-references and indulgence for making quips about the ridiculousness of it all, peppered with plenty of black comedy, it works wonderfully by itself.Serious Sam 3 does get plenty of what made the original games did right. The guns feel fantastic, Sam is still a talkative hardass and most of the classic enemies have returned, with some minor changes. Running jokes, running and gunning, it's all great fun. The graphics are stellar and everything feels crisp. In games like these, the plot takes a backseat to the gameplay at hand, and for good reason. All we know is that Sam's gotta bust an alien army and save the world, that's it. Anything else acts as a transition between levels and sets up the scene. When it comes to controlling, there is only one flaw I can think of and it pertains to Sam's unusually heavy jumping, making platforming somewhat of a hassle.Despite staying true to the original Serious Sam, specifically the First Encounter, it is ultimately the biggest flaw - it stays TOO close to the original. All of the levels are in Egypt. You get a wide variety of: open desert, desert with shrines and temples, underground desert temples, and desert favelas. None of the creative, interesting levels from the Second Encounter or Serious Sam 2 make an appearance in this game. As a result, the game gets VERY repetitive in a short amount of time, which is further compounded by the sheer size of levels in Serious Sam games. Much of the humour relies on one-liners and banters, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself. However, SS2 went way out of the box and went balls to the wall with silliness, so it's a shame to see 99% of it getting passed over in this rendition. NETRICSA, Sam's ""in-game guide"" so to speak has also been neutered as well, offering less information from before and just not worth reading, whereas in previous games, you could read the data sheets of enemies and get a glut of both funny and useful information.Had there been more level and environment variety with a bit more risk taken, this would have been a much better game. But I can't fault it for what it is, it's still Serious Sam. Buy it when it's more than 50% on sale and you'll get, what I feel, is the right pricepoint for it.6.5/10.			",179,45,0,19,7,1,25

												After playing all the Serious Sams and reluctantly finishing the terrible Serious Sam 2, it was great to see that Serious Sam 3 was again more serious than the cartoonyness of SS2.I enjoyed SS3 mostly, it had a sense of urgency and franticness, and amusing dialogue from Sam, with hordes of enemies to kill.I liked the improved graphics.Hordes of enemies to kill especially in the 2nd half of the game you get insane amounts thrown at you.Sams Humorous dialogue, which made me laugh or at least amuse me most of the time.Like that you can melee enemies and rip out their eyes, hearts and can use them as a weapon against other enemies.I dislike that it can feel very repetitive and tiresome, especially the last level, it just dragged on and on.It's easy to get lost and confused on lvls, I had to replay lvls just so I could beat it in half the time.Overall I had fun and enjoyed playing this game.I recommend it and rate it 7/10.

												This might be the best single-player first person shooter ever. I'm not even kidding. Start on hard or higher and never ever touch the quicksave/quickload keys.The beginning of the game kinda sucks in that the enemies you fight are super easy and it takes a little bit to get out of the usual corridor-shooting stuff, but all was forgiven after about half an hour. The variety in enemy behavior, the variety in weapon usage, the constantly-changing arenas, the constantly changing visibility, the perfectly rationed ammo and health pickups, and the tension added to the game when you can't quicksave all mash together and make the big fights in this game wonderful.

												Personal Rating: 7 of 10First off, excellent graphics style upgrade since SS:TFE and SS:TSE (HD). This is how I always visualized Serious Sam should be and not the cartoonish SS2 which did not make it into the limelight. If you've played the previous installment you will pretty much get the idea of this game. Hordes of monsters and variety of arsenal at your dispose. Cheesy dialog and tonnes of lead and gore.The game stick to its root but added some interesting weapons and features and a dash of new enemies, which in my opinion is just nice. Controls are fluid and the soundtrack is, well, annoying as usual with the rock solid sound effect. Up until now, there are still some servers running with a pinch of community playing co-op game but unfortunately for me, I wasn't in the US so ping was horrible.If you are just getting this game for its single player mode, my advice is take it slow and steady. One step at a time will get you there. ",1029,415,36,151,105,7,188

												This game is like someone's memory of what it was like to play Duke Nukem 3D when they were 12 years old.  They remember it being way more over the top, violent, profane, bizzare, and hilarious than it actually was.  Like when your dad talks about a fish he caught and exagerates it's size by several magnitudes.  When you see a half dozen men running at you across the desert, with their heads chopped off and bombs bolted to their hands, screaming at the top of their lungs as they prepare to kamikaze you, you will understand that this game is that fish, but it actually is just as big as your dad said it was.

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend this game skip to Results and read from there.Croteam continues the epic saga that is Serious Sam pushing the foundations why this game tests time. Serious Sam 3: BFE is a brilliant rendition of all the elements that made this game so seriously epic. Story:Serious Sam 3: BFE is a prequel to the Serious Sam The First Encounter. The world is under attack by Mental and his forces as Sam and his team must retrieve research data behind the Sirian weapon system that could be the key behind defeating the world’s most devastating foe. As all of Sam’s comrades fall and he pushes the forces of Mental down one by one the world falls into dust and it would seem all is lost. Using his trusty comrade Netrisca Sam is able to solve the Sirian puzzle and land right where Serious Sam The First Encounter Begins. Campaign:Serious Sam 3: BFE is divided into twelve levels that gradually increase in length. The levels start out rather short, but extend in length lasting reaching over an hour and a half each. There are six difficulties which scale brilliantly: Tourist, Easy, Medium, Hard, Serious, and Mental. Beating the campaign on Serious unlocks Mental difficulty, which adds a whole new element to the campaign. Even on Serious Difficulty you will essentially be slaughtering waves of enemies that will fall to your feet as if you were a wolf amongst lambs… The sea will run red with the blood of your enemies!!! The easier the difficulty the more ridiculous the slaughter will be, depending on how you play you may enjoy the easier skills. The campaign has epic puzzles and brilliant boss fights that keep you on the edge of your seat. Most of the bosses throughout the game are mostly just regular enemies that are slightly stronger; although, two of the bosses Ugh-Zan IV and Alcor Class Warship are brilliant new editions to the game that relate to the original story.Gameplay:Serious Sam 3: BFE follows suit with the other games in the series. You play a complete and total bad♥♥♥♥♥modeled after a 80s action hero as you defeat thousands upon thousands of enemies. The game boasts fifteen weapons: Fists, Sledgehammer, Axe, Sirian Mutilator, SOP38 Pistol, 12 Gauge Pump-Action Shotgun, Double Barrel Coach Gun, M29 Infantry Assault Rifle, XM-214-A Minigun, XPML21 Rocket Launcher, XL2 Lasergun, AS-24 Devastator, RAPTOR Sniper Rifle, C-4 Demolition Charge, and SBC Cannon. The combinations of epic weapons give you a huge diversity of methods to defeat the mass enemies that are ahead of you. Jewel of the Nile DLC:Jewel of the Nile is a fantastic addition to Serious Sam 3 BFE. This addition changes the dynamic of SS3 BFE by changing the game from a mass shooter to puzzle solving. The levels resemble more of a DOOM or Shadow Warrior style where you will be finding secrets and solving puzzles. The DLC includes three levels: Gathering of the Gods, Together Forever, and Born Again. These levels make the secret weapons more available and the jetpack from the final boss fight a featured element. This DLC offers amazing new features and includes epic boss fights to boot. Hints:>I would recommend looking up where to find the secret XL2 Lasergun and ammo as if you don’t you probably won’t get to use it.>I would recommend looking up where to find the secret RAPTOR Sniper Rifle and ammo as if you don’t you probably won’t get to use it. >I would recommend looking up where to find the secret SBC Cannon because it’s just fun to use, although you will get it later in the game.Results:Serious Sam 3: BFE continues the brilliance of the series by pushing the foundation of the original and only making the series that much greater. I would recommend getting this game even if it’s at full price. With DLC added you and Steam Workshop support this game offers more than you could image. SS3: BFE plays like an 80s action movie where you play an amazing hero who runs in guns blazing and kills thousands of enemies while only getting minor scratches. Pros:+With fifteen different weapons you will never be bored.+Twelve fantastic levels that are all unique and incorporate new features and elements. +Many different enemies, some new some old, that keep you at check.+Loads of secrets that increase replay value and make you want to scour the levels.+A jetpack for the final boss battle making taking Sam to all new levels (get it, because he can fly)+So much nostalgia, so much feels.Cons:-Some of the weapons are secret and you will not get to use them if you don’t find them.-The sun shines into your eyes essentially blinding you at certain points in the campaign.

												Serious Sam: One of the best shooter games since 2001, the whole game is just nonstop action, to every corner you go. to every room you enter, you just cant be surprise there is an half an army of aliens jumping on you and trying to kill you. Did you ever shoot to much that you felt like your arms are about to fall? If you didnt, this game will give you that feel. Its really fun to play and a good game to waste your time, like seriusly, I got nearly 20 hrs on it and 99% of the time I was shoting aliens. The gameply and the smooth of this game, its just crazy. The arsenal you build your self during the game is also one of the thing you must love on it. Great game. Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I will start off by saying that I have played and finished all the PC SS games, (FE, SE and SS2) and own their release date boxed versions, so I love the series. But BFE is tedious, has zero new ideas, repetitive environments, boring level design, and annoying new enemies. I completely felt like Croteam lost their way with it, and forgot that what made original SS games stand out was the fact that they went against the industry norm at the time, and did something fresh. With SS3 not only did they repeat most of what the older games did without building on it, they also added a whole bunch of unoriginal elements copied from modern shooters. Simply put, this is a boring game because it doesn't do anything new as a SS game or as an FPS Action game. I only got half way through it back in 2013, and then started playing it over in 2016 thinking maybe I just wasn't in the right mood to enjoy it back then, but that wasn't the case. I only managed to finish it by forcing my self to play it, and only because I couldn't stand not finishing a Sam game. Serious Sam 2 gets ragged on by SS fans a lot, but it's a much more fun game then this.  Anyway, I post this review in hopes that maybe it will have some kind of influence over SS4, which I am very much anticipating. I hope Croteam realizes that SS formula has been copied and improved on in recent years, by games like Shadow Warrior (2013) and the new Doom, which means they have to do a lot more then build a same game with new levels and better graphics. People forget how influential first SS game actually was, it took the FPS games out of the scripted corridors and put the focus back on fun, Painkiller and the new Doom would not be games they are if it wasn't for Serious Sam. Serious Sam 4 needs to feel fresh again, just like FE did all those years ago. TLDR: Many long time serious Sam fans will most likely find BFE boring, I would really only recommended this for people who haven't played SE and FE.

												If you weren't already convinced on the Serious Sam Series (from reading my previous review on Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter), then you should listen up.While this, the newest game in the franchise, may not be as stable, it brings a lot of new elements to the table.This includes new enemies, some hard to kill, others easier, instant melee attacks exclusive to each enemy, some that instantly kill them, but leave you vulnerable for up to about four seconds, new weapon designs, brilliant level design, even more insane waves of enemies, revamped graphics (that go well with the HD versions of the classic games), a ♥♥♥♥ing sledgehammer, alien helicopters, Sam with gloves, co-op play, one billion secrets, 120% more one-liners relating The Artist Formerly known as Prince and also that loud growl that comes on when a boss or a horde of enemies attacks you.TL,DR; Two thumbs WAY up.

												Solid, fun shooter with an insanely good co-op mode.Definitely worth picking up if you can get it for under £10, not sure if I'd spend more than that on it though.Guns are good, gameplay is fun. Monsters don't seem to react PARTICULARLY well when shot - just splashes of red blood and limited impact of your bullets other than this. Makes the combat feel a bit cheap.But hey, it's good fun for that kind of money anyway, I got it for about £3.50 so I'm not complaining at all!			",330,52,9,36,22,2,34

												Yes, I think this is a good buy... if getting on a good sale or in a bundle.  If you liked the first two Serious Sam games, then most of the game will seem very similar.  Hundreds and hundreds of enemies to kill.  Some fun weapons.  Gore.  To be honest, even though this game is about 5 years old, the developers did not stop patching it.  I still feel as of this day of my review that some parts of this game was not optimized well.  The graphics can stutter at times.  Having a 1070 card and still seeing what I saw with an Nvidia 460 as fair as some graphics problems, it seems that again some parts were not written well.  Sam's face when he talks seems off.  The animation to swing the sledgehammer or axe or to perform melee on some enemies was off as well.  However, this game can look really nice.  Some people have complained about the dust clouds; while this could hinder sight i.e. killing the next several enemies, it was ""realistic"" from a standpoint of sometimes killing or destroying something left a mess.Voice acting is okay.  There are some decent one liners from Sam just like in the first two games.  One turnoff for me was the use of the f word, which I felt was not necessary.  Gameplay was something that was not consistent in pacing.  The first segments of the game felt disconjointed compared to mid game or late game.  If you hate going forward a little only to have to go back due to a flood of enemies, then some of the later levels may be frustrating.  The end boss of the main campain and the end boss of the DLC Jewel of the Nile can be an exercise in patience of learning what to do.  You may want to pick third person mode/perspective for some parts.  So, I have listed some concerns, why would I recommend this title?  Again, if you liked the first two titles, then you will enjoy more of the same with this title; light puzzles, tons of enemies, frag/gore, guns, melee, some humor, different difficulties for a challenge, fun soundtrack, old fashion shooter, steam workshop/mods.

												Serious Sam 3: BFE follows the tradition of its predecessors, First Encounter and Second Encounter, very well.All the elements of this series are there: the waves of aliens, the weapons and more importantly, the laughs. No other game has given me so many laugh-out-loud moments as Serious Sam: The Franchise.Considering when the game was released, the graphics still look great. It does look great on a 3840x2160 monitor and the level of detail is impressive. There are several ‘eye candy’ vistas to be had.Thanks, Croteam! ",22,0,0,5,2,0,1

												Serious Sam 3: BFE is a first-person shooter video game developed by Croteam and published by Devolver Digital. It is part of the Serious Sam series and a prequel to The First Encounter. The game's story takes place in the 22nd century, during Mental's invasion of Earth, as implied in The First Encounter. The game is set in Egypt and features a 16-player co-operative campaign mode, as well as 4-player splitscreen. The game was released on November 22, 2011 on Windows, October 17, 2012 on Xbox Live Arcade, while the PlayStation 3 version was released on May 13, 2014.Like previous titles in the series, Serious Sam 3: BFE involves fighting against many hordes of enemies in wide-open environments. However Serious Sam 3 has more closed environments than its predecessors, particularly in the early levels. There are also a larger number of enemies that can attack the player from a distance.The player can carry an unlimited amount of weapons, including a minigun, rocket launcher, assault rifle and a cannon. There are 13 weapons total. 5 of them have a manual reload. The signature close-combat weapons from the first game, the knife and chainsaw, have been replaced with a sledgehammer with three modes of attack (vertical strike, 180 turn and full 360 turn).When I said the 360, I know you first thought of 360 Spin, also, no scope :)))))))There is no regenerating health, instead there are health and armor power-ups scattered throughout the levels that the player must pick up. Additionally, the levels are full of secret areas, where health, armor, ammo and in some cases, weapons from later levels can be found, following the tradition of the previous games. Some weapons such as the Lasergun and the Sniper Rifle and their respective ammunition pickups are in fact secret-only, and otherwise are not found in the levels normally. There are no puzzles, however the player must find keys, pull levers and find environmental anomalies to progress.Classic enemies such as the Beheaded Kamikaze, Beheaded Rocketeer and Kleer Skeleton return in the game. New ones include the Khnum and Scrapjack (resembling the Hell Knight and Mancubus from Doom, respectively), as well as the cloned soldiers reminiscent of the Strogg from the Quake series. The Kamikaze has returned to his original design, rather than the Serious Sam II design. The Gnaar's design has radically been changed from the original game. It is now much larger, differently shaped and walks on all fours, unlike its bipedal counterpart in Serious Sam.Rate: 11/10			",195,20,9,16,14,0,10

												Can't recommend it at anything resembling full price, really. They took a good shot at it, but ultimately the earlier games were just better in terms of level design, and while Serious Sam 3 has more elaborate graphics, they're also more ANNOYING graphics as enemies are constantly obscured by dust clouds and other purposeless effects.The final boss was also seriously lame, and it was hard to tell whether they were trying to make fun of SERIOUS MODERN SHOOTER plotlines or actually thought they were writing a good one. Serious Sam 1 and 2 are going to remain my favourites of the series, but the middle of Serious Sam 3 is pretty good.The start suffers from just a serious lack of fun weapons, and the end just has... too many interminable waves of enemies. They just keep coming in dribs and drabs even once the initial rush of potential annihilation is gone and you're just left going: ""When is this gonna stop so I can move on?""

												Not a game I believe have a lot of understanding of to review, but it's not like there's much to understand, or need to. This is an old school first person shooter and that is simply the best way to put it. Don't look at the word 'serious' in its title expecting something serious, because this game is just filled with blistering death and explosions. It is especially fun when playing with your friends, either in co-op or versus (the latter in particular being packed with an insane amount of adrenaline). While the environments don't vary much, the level design is overall splendid. There's just an unfortunate lack of polish within the game though, despite that, the dialogue's funny, the guns are entertaining to use, and the enemies have a nice amount of differing designs. It's a very good game for the budget it has. 7.8/10.0 ",332,52,17,28,17,1,21

												the most serious game ever made no joke lolwell this is the 3rd game in the serious sam series but the plot tells what happens before the first game ( how did sam travel to the past), BFE stand for before the first encounter which means chronologically it's the first game in the series, so i recommend you to play this one first then go get the first and second encounter HD remake then serious sam 2 to understand the entire plot .-graphicly it's really beautiful and stunning (runs on serious engine 3.5) run it on ultra and still got 60fps .-gameplay is a bit different from old serious sam games , this time you can reload your weapons also new type of weapon ( melee and new pistol ,new shotgun ,rifle...ect ) and new bosses, new game mod online or co op and split screen , funny moments , easter eggs and reference are present in this episode too but the game get sometimes really hard until it becomes ridiculous especially the last one where you have to fight 1740 monster )-as always the voice acting is excellent , metal music , great sound effects-online game is good , alot of mods for co op or versus but sadly not a lot of people are playing it so you will find the servers most of the times empty ( doesnt help when you want to get achievements except if you have friends that have the game too)-no bugs or glitches ( the devs update the game each time they find something isn't working right)-most of the achievements are easy to get but others are a bit hard cause they are only obtained by playing online and not a lot of people are playing it-steam trading cards.i highly recommend this game for those who want a serious hardcore challenging game ( if not you just play on easy ) and get the dlcs too (they offer some good extras and a good solo campaign (3h of gameplay) ) worth the money but you can grab it on sales ( dlcs on sales are 0.99$  )9/10			",636,174,27,75,40,8,63

												Ah, SS3. Here's the tl;dr: =======(steamfriend): so I really dunno wtf to do in SS games.OOO67VH: kill♥♥♥♥♥♥br>=======Now, the review.  ----- 6/10 above average, barely -----  Thank you, Steam Friend, for prompting this review.This review is for those who don't know Sam and haven't played the other SS games.Unlike Sanctum2, Borderlands2, Team Fortress 2, Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead 2 (differentiated characters co-op), Serious Sam 3 is essentially:- wildly killing things.In co-op, add these astonishing features:- several people running around; - i think they're killing things too;- dying;- running back to kill more things.Sure, it's similar to Sanctum 2 or Borderlands 2 in that regard. It's snarky, like BL2. That's always a plus.But there is a sense of teamwork in other games. Kiting (leading on a baddie to get his back turned to another shooter). Specialization. One-two punches. Syncopating bullet storms.One, new to co-op, might wander in SS3 to a point where one is both lost and seeing zero baddies, and the game might stay that way for that person for 5 minutes. Lost, with 'fighting sounds somewhere over there'. That's silly.Here's the rub: there's absolutely zero incentive for others to notice, much less find the team and fight together. In 2013, that's also silly.Killing Floor/Left 4 Dead 2, OTOH, on Hard, requires that every single member take turns syncopate a bullet storm, have multitasking medics, for the entire team to survive. Don't get me wrong. I enjoy it, though. SS3 is a fast-paced shoot-everything-that-moves game. It, like the other SS, has zero active story and purpose. It's like the original DOOM. The goal is to kill♥♥♥♥♥♥to get to a key, which unlocks a door, so that you can get to kill more♥♥♥♥♥♥DOOM reference!Co-op SS3 means only that more baddies are on-screen and more people are coincidentally playing in the same general map.I have bought it for a few friends. I did the same with Borderlands 2, Sanctum 2, and Killing Floor. We play the living hell out of those games. We've played SS3 just once, I think.But I've played it for hours on solo. It's fun. But it knows its place in gaming. So should you, before you buy it.Better value than easily half the movies I've ever rented.			",2333,1129,94,243,297,26,323

												Serious Sam 3...where do I begin?Starting off, the gameplay is solid. If you have never played Serious Sam, it's an FPS where you take on hordes of alien enemies in large open areas. These enemies range from reanimated EDF infantry to giant god-like beasts that would make any normal man♥♥♥♥♥♥himself. Thankfully, you are given quite the colorful arsenal of weapons, from the humble pistol and shotgun all the way to laser guns and cannons that launch uranium cannonballs. Of course, certain enemies are better killed with specific weapons, encouraging ammo conservation over blindly wasting rare ammunition on enemies which could easily be killed with one or two shots from a pistol.Now, as much as I enjoy the game, it does have its problems. The difficulty can get pretty ridiculous at times, especially if you aren't too good at fps games. like me Also, the lack of a wave indicator or ""horde health bar"" can make waves feel like they're just padding the game along. The addition of having to reload certain guns every so often, while not usually too much of a problem, can get annoying in intense fights where you have to deal with enemies that both shoot at you from a distance and charge you relentlessly.All in all, Serious Sam 3 is pretty good. I recommend it to anyone who wants a break from the FPS norm.			",68,2,0,0,3,1,1

												""See you in 3000 BC ♥♥♥♥♥, I'm headin' for the timelock!""Earth is under direct attack and there isn't much you can do to save it, so just turn on a time machine and save it in the past!Serious Sam 3: BFE (Before First Encounter or Biscuit Fortification Experiment) is the game that essentially puts all the games events in motion.Put on your cool dudebro shades and your dudebro earpeice and start your killing spree against the alien nasties that are waging war on mother nature and her children. (...you)The gameplay is pretty much the same as the other Serious Sam games which basically says this game is a throwback to how ""FPS were in the day"" so don't expect this to be a game intended for the Call of Duty audience.

												Good FPS with old school approach. I played the First and Second Encounter when younger and recently the HD version in coop, the 3rd uses the same formula and is competent in offering an arcade FPS which the goal is to shoot everything that moves with big guns.The gameplay is simple, advance through the scenario wiping out hordes of enemies that have their peculiarities, for those who played the first the nostalgia is inevitable when hearing a characteristic scream. The new engine can deliver good graphics and visuals, but at a cost, the game is a bit poorly optimized, the mechanics are basically the same with minor additions. There is no plot, just a context, the emphasis is for the badass personality of the protagonist.It is a simple and brainless shooter, I recommend playing in coop because tends to get boring over the time. 7/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

												The sequel that Serious Sam: The Second Encounter deserves.Serious Sam 3 drops lifes system and toy guns of Serious Sam 2, and brings the crazy over-the-top action back into the series. Some new additions help the game feel fresh, such as a sledgehammer, and enemy-specific melee attacks. You can also complain about the CoD-like sprinting and iron-sights mechanics until you're blue in the face, but theres no denying that they make the game more fast paced and frantic.The campaign can also be played co-op with up to 16 players, and the versus multiplayer is still as addictive and balanced as ever.Somewhat poor optimization here and there, but overall, Serious Sam 3 is one of the most complete and accessible games in the series to date. If you're not a fan of the series, this won't change your mind. But for eveyone else, give it a try. ",527,95,11,34,30,6,36

There is much game modes such as campaign, versus, survival and more really cool game!			",279,62,16,31,15,7,25

												Here goes my first attempt at a ""serious"" review. Serious Sam 3 has great gunplay and customization.That being said there were several questionable choices made by the developers such as:-Extremely slow first few levels and super long levels over all: When all you have is the shotgun and imo boring assault rifle the first few levels are really rough, tons of hitscan and lame monsters like the technopolip a person might get the wrong idea about the game in general. Later it's a lot better though. Sad because the other Sams are fun the whole way.-Enemy trickle effect: Lets slowly let enemies pile into the playing field instead of doing them in nice clear waves so players get bored standing there killing 1-3 at a time. Okay. Yeah this speaks for itself, super annoying. Last level this is SUPER awful and annoying. Artificially extends the game length like a half hour at least.-Default Performance settings: Are all horrible, to get any kind of FPS out of the game unless your computer is crazy (and mine pretty good) you have to tweak settings a bit. Average Joe gamer is okay with 45 fps but he's usually on a console w/30 fps anyways. This is PC gaming and you should have your midrange presets giving midrange pcs 60+, preferably 100+. But instead its like 5-7 settings that don't get changed that really should so people claim this game has crap performance. Blame the preset options.-Technopolips: Super annoying to fight and when you only have the rocketlauncher to kill them it's just really all around annoying. They can shoot you thru stuff, kill you really fast and chase you around, all while being immune to small arms and having high hp, and ya know, flying. Slows gameplay to a crawl and makes it annoying and not as fun as it should be.-Enemies immune to small arms: No place for this in any SS game, terrible design. Makes weapon caches required, bad design.-Weapon caches: Infinite ammo gets really boring, enemies immune to small arms aren't interesting or fun. Make better more interesting levels please.-Brides: Slow gameplay down, take control away, pointlessly slow to kill because they gotta pop up a few times and you have to look for them, really annoying.-Space Monkies: Terrible, I C'4d the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of those pillars or logged off the game for a while every time i saw these. They hide and attack you around pillars. So there's several places where its just you chasing the stupid monkies around, they aren't really a threat but id rather be mowing down hordes of kamikazes and stuff. Slow gameplay to a crawl as well.-Dark flashlight sequences where you move slow: Slow gameplay, make the game scary, which i can't stand personally, i dont play SS to be scared but to have fun.-OP wrist lightning thing: Just really lame overall, looks cool, should be a gun or something.-OP Devastator: Fun but too much better than the rocket launcher, prefer sniper rifle and grenade launcher instead of weird OP combo gun.-Sam is _too_ Serious and swears constantly for no reason: SS1 TFE TSE were hilarious. I loved SS2's style even tho most ppl didnt. But SS3 my god man, you don't need random pointless love interest for sam, or him cursing constantly. So weird and out of place from the rest of the games.-Animations: 3rd person and some others are really bad.-Egypt: No more god damn egypt lol. Make levels bright and fun like SS2 or TSE.-Laser gun: NOT ENOUGH OF IT, favorite gun in the series!That being said many good choices were also made:-Graphics: Beautiful, awesome looking-Sounds: Some great sounds (gore/rocketlauncher) Some not so great (assault rifle)-Gunplay: Overall fun, not as good as SS1 or SS2 as far as i'm concerned however.-Scrapjacks: Great new monster, pretty fun to fight, i prefer the T-rexes and big red guys from SS2 though.-Gore: Is great in this game.-Last boss: These games always have a gimmick at the end, look at quake or nearly any game like this, keeps the hectic tradition alive.It seems from my review that I might of not liked the game but overall its pretty fun if you like serious sam games and can set it up for decent fps and make it thru the first few painful imo pretty terrible levels. 6.5/10 (+1.5-2)			",351,58,3,60,18,2,35

												This game goes back to the original formula of Serious Sam: First Encounter and Serious Sam: Second Enounter. The setting is strictly desert, and the story has returned to the original idea proposed in Serious Sam FE and SE. The original weapons and enemies make a reappearance, though they are graphically overhauled.In addition, this game's overall feeling is the most Serious out of the 4 main games, as Sam is the most human in this one: Swearing, showing some feeling, and socializing. Definitely a main part of the story.I recommend that if you buy this in a pack, play this one first before all others. This is where, chronologically, the story all began.			",97,4,1,10,11,2,11

Serious Sam 3: BFEI'm a bit biased when I review these kinds of games, I will admit. I've wasted spent countless hours in school playing games such as Counter-Strike, Doom, Quake, Halo, and Serious Sam over LAN, and they've retained a soft spot in my heart as a result. I will try to look at this newest iteration of the Serious Sam franchise fairly, though.GraphicsSerious Sam 3: BFE has received a fresh coat of paint, despite the fact that it still technically runs on the same engine as previous titles. On the whole, I feel positive about this game's visuals, though they're very far from being perfect. It stays true to the Serious Sam art style, and it looks decent enough at first glance. The two main issues are texture detail and the level decoration. The former is simple: Upon closer inspection, textures are lower resolution than I would like. The latter is a bit more complex. Because of how much the game sticks to its drab, somewhat limited Egyptian color palette, it isn't too difficult to get stuck somewhere in a level because you aren't sure where to go next. Despite this, the monsters look fleshy and it is quite satisfying to gib them back to 3000 BC.


Damn Ugly

AudioThe weapon sounds aren't bad, but they won't stick with you as much as the classic weapon sounds in previous games. The enemies all have distinct growls and grovels, and they come to life very nicely when combined with the game's models. Voice acting is about what I expected: Mostly unimpressive, but the one-liners and voluminous vocabulary of John J. D𝗂ck still haven't grown old to me. Additionally, the soundtrack carries on the style of the original Serious Sam: TFE, and goes extremely well with the atmosphere of the game.PerformanceThis game will perform well enough on most systems that meet the requirements; mine easily maxes it out and maintains a comfortable 60 FPS. The one place I really have to complement Croteam with this game is in the graphics options. Serious Sam 3: BFE has, quite possibly, the absolute most detailed graphics options I've seen yet in a video game; I am seriously impressed by how many settings there are.GameplaySerious Sam 3: BFE is a classic first-person shooter that largely revolves around crowd control. It features smooth controls reminiscent of a Doom or Quake game, though this new one introduces a sprint feature which will violently accelerate your character up to the speed of classic Doomguy. The only weapon with a scope is the sniper rifle; while some others do have sights they do nothing besides look pretty and slightly zoom in the screen. Against the style of previous games, weapons other than the player's sidearm now need to be reloaded, but the sidearm retains its classic infinite pool of magazines. Weapons hit hard and fast, and you can carry all at once if you find them. Classic mechanics such as rocket jumping also work to a limited extent in Serious Sam 3: BFE. I found it enjoyable in singleplayer and co-op, but the adversarial multiplayer didn't show off gameplay quite as well.


Ultimate Showdown

SingleplayerThe campaign follows Sam ""Serious"" Stone as he treks across Egypt in search of some fantastic MacGuffin that will solve all of his problems - and the current problem is the alien invasion that has nearly driven humanity to extinction. While there are cutscenes and other humans in-game, they never assist the player, and typically appear as corpses by the time Sam reaches them. Instead, the campaign finds itself initially playing out like a city-crawling corridor-shooter, but it soon dumps this in favor of classic Serious Sam arenas with massive hordes of enemies to whittle down and endure over. It's par for the course, and I liked it, but the story isn't anything special, so if you're looking for something like Bioshock or a Telltale Games adventure title, look elsewhere.MultiplayerThis game features two multiplayer modes; adversarial and cooperative. I'll cover the former of those two first. It's hardly played at all now, and understandably so: the maps aren't designed particularly well, there isn't great incentive to keep playing, and it clearly wasn't even the focus of the game. The cooperative is where this game shines, however. It features a wide array of options for difficulty and supports 1-16 players, allowing them to play the entire campaign as well as custom maps. Playing alongside three or four other friends attempting to survive against hordes of alien mooks is perhaps the best way to experience Serious Sam, and it is some bloody good fun.Community ContentSerious Sam 3: BFE features a built-in mod menu and decent support for modifications and community content, which raises the question of why there is such a lack of good community content. It is a sad fact that the modifications are largely retextured enemies with different statistics, weapon value modifications, or new cosmetic models for players and their weapons. There is some great potential for custom campaigns, but I haven't been able to find anything that truly takes advantage of that potential yet.

VerdictWithout a doubt, Serious Sam 3: BFE is a cooperative-focused game. The campaign was designed about as well as previous ones - albeit with a fresh coat of paint and some better presentation - and despite its flaws, this is a good singleplayer/co-op title. The price of $39.99 hurts it a little, because it doesn't quite reach that value, but if you're a fan of classic arena shooters and you find it on sale, you might just find something really enjoyable with Serious Sam 3: BFE.I would recommend Serious Sam 3: BFE, but would suggest waiting for a sale.

												I'm confused why this game isn't very popular in Steam, while Left 4 Dead 2 had a huge success. Serious Sam 3 is like the HD version of Left 4 Dead 2 with increased thrill and gore in the game. Plus you'll smash alien with sledgehammers here rather than shooting zombies. Of course, I can't compare L4D2 with Serious Sam 3 since the base concept of the game is totally different. But both of these are Co-Op games. And both of them gave me the same amount of fun when I play with my own friends. Anyway, here's my review :1.GraphicsStunning graphics with intense amount of blood and gore along the game. Almost every aspect of the graphics beautifully made in this game. The only downside was the crude animation when the characters speak.2.SoundI love the soundtracks ! It really fits your situation in the game and the music changes each time you're in a new situation.3.GameplayThrilling, fun, and challenging. I can't even survive the Normal difficulty after playing FPS for 14 years. I'm also not new to the gameplay style, since I played Serious Sam : The First and The Second Encounter Co-Op with my dad when I was 6 years old. The health and armor supply in the map is really low that you have to fight really carefully to conserve your HP and armor.4.PricingHonestly,it's not really expensive. Your money will really worth it and you'll get what you pay for. There's only 1 DLC and the game is 100% non pay to win. Buy it.			",194,25,9,11,23,1,19

												Serious Sam 3; BFE (Before First Encounter) is probably one of the best games Croteam ever made! The game offers Single Player and Multiplayer game modes,with both are fun,full of violence,gore,awesome catchphrases and of course great animations! The multiplayer doesn't lag,well at least for me. Best parts of the Single Player campaign (and cooperative) are the cool melee attacks! One moment you are ripping a Gnaars eye,and the other breaking Scorpions necks! Double Barrel shotgun is the perfect tool in blowing some in too two billion pieces! Playing multiplayer is awesome for trolling with the Sledgehammer or the DBShotgun! For all Serious Sam fans,this is the perfect game to buy,and DLC is worth the money too! Finding out what lead to The First Encounter is great. The sound,the graphics and the videos are PERFECTLY DONE! THIS GAME IS RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE! WELL DONE CROTEAM AND WELL DONE DEVOLVER DIGITAL! YOU MADE A MASTER PIECE!			",85,9,0,5,7,2,2

												All my life I was always fascinated by the battle of thermopoly  when I was ten or eleven I always though now how would that have went if the spartans had a mini gun?Well If you ever wanted to know the answer to the question look no further.Tons of choke point battles where one man with a mini gun, and a host of other weapons is pitted against nearly endless hordes.Well ok that's not completely true the hordes do have an end but it feels like they're unending.This is a game where it gives you that sense of accomplishment, and teaches you that yes, that wave was hard but the next one is even worse.Seriously buy this, there's few shooters like this on the market it's well worth the purchase.

												It's funny how this game which was inspired by Duke Nukem in the first place ends up being 100x better than Duke Nukem Forever. If anything, this game should have been the true sequel of Duke Nukem 3D.Anyway this game is one of the best games in the modern fast paced  style first person shooters, and I myself am a huge fan of old school shooters like Doom, Quake 3 Arena and Duke Nukem 3D. In a time when MOBA's, CoD clones and bland mixtures of both, I gotta congratulate CroTeam personally, they made a game that has that old school charm, that old school difficulty, that makes you rage but at the same time the game rewards you for a job well done, something that most modern games threw it away to appeal to a casual audience (well until Doom 2016 came out but that's another review). In other words, this game stands out from all the FPS garbage we have been fed upon ever since the release of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. The replay value is certainly there, the secrets are well hidden. Once again, CroTeam, who were inspired by the fast paced old school shooters, they created a masterpiece. I do recommend fully that you buy this game if you are into fast paced challenging first person shooters and at the same time tired of the bland modern CoD genre. Seriously, this game is worth every cent.			",123,6,4,15,3,3,15

Serious Sam 3 BFE		* 8/10A new chapter for Sam ""Serious"" Stone. It's a prequel... Why does it always have to be a prequel?Serious Sam 3 is a classic FPS with a very classic structure. This prequel marks a return to the classic first 2 encounters with renewed graphics, weapons, enemies and a new story. Yes, story. Serious sam isn't exactly famous for its deep story, but this chapter has put some effort in it. Some cutscenes, few other characters and dialogues and some events explaining what sam did before the first encounter. Of course, this isn't a Kojima production, but you can see the difference with the previous chapters.As a classic FPS there's not much to say, mechanics are the usual, and as every other SS you will face huge waves of enemies with the classic arsenal. Actually there's not much to say, the engine is not the Cryengine but Croteam shows a great taste with environments and landscapes building great levels with great visual impact as usual. Enemies and Weapons are the classic as seen in the first encounter, but revisited and kind of updated, with just a couple of news. Music is Badass again, with epic tunes, Heavy boss tracks and some tracks with a touch of tension tracks in some dark and closed map sections (which is kind of new and strange to see in a Serious Sam game... O.o... But kind of welcome, anyways).Shortly, Serious Sam 3 gives us a very good prequel with the classic sarcasm and fun situations, Hordes of enemies to take down with the classic arsenal, everything shown with the new version of the good and trusty Serious Engine.+++Pros+++ ENGINE. The serious engine has never made any miracle but it always showed beautiful landscapes and settings, and this time makes no exception. GAMEPLAY. The classic Waves gameplay is always fun to play as the first 2 encounter, and Sam is always a funny A$$h0l3 whenever e has the chance to talk... Which is quite often... XD COOP. The game is playable in Coop as every other chapter and it's obviously more fun to play. SOUNDTRACK. A beautiful soundtrack again in this chapter with Epic tunes, Badass Heavy boss tracks and even tense tracks for dark sections.---Cons--- LEVELS. Even though there's a good alternation between indoor sections (Temples, dark dungeons) and outdoor locations (the city, Desert), they may kind of look repetitive. For example This never happens in the Second encounter as it has many different themed locations. ",495,126,12,20,23,4,28

												This game, let me give you a review. This is (as we all know it) one of those worshipped franchises since 2001. Serious Sam 3: BFE provides the following: a story, fast paced action, graphics, not so descent voice acting, secrets, no hand posing, some hand holding, easy normal and hard AI, gore, not so advance physics engine, aliens, destructive guns, a workshop, and other things you can find out on your own if you get this game. 7/10			",125,1,0,1,2,2,2

												A great single player. And a VERY bad mutiplayer, it's unbalanced, the sniper rifle kills in ONE SHOT even if you have full armor and health, and it's fast almost like a machine gun and it spawns every 30 seconds. So all you have to do is camping that sniper and kill everyone in one single shot. The spash damage of the rocket launcher is too big, so you can't dodge it. (Siplified to make noobs happy) The double barrel shotgun is just too powerful, same thing for the minigun. 1 Inch jumps, you can't shoot while you're running, (Another thing to make things easier). If you have an old PC (Like me) and you're trying to play a dark map with the flashlight belt, you can't see anything, it's just impossible to play. Too much dust when the bullets hits the ground ( You can't see anything) If you  join a match in progress, when it's loading for the match, everyone can kill you because your character is in the game when it's loading to play. Please Croteam, don't make the same mistakes on Serious Sam 4.We want a multiplayer which looks more like Serious Sam HD The Second Encounter, fast, competitive and fun.			",80,3,0,3,1,0,3

												I make a up to this game because I'm a Serious Sam fan, anyway when I first played it, I enjoyed it very much because it was really new to see such things in a Serious Sam game, but later when I reached 50 hours, it was getting more boring than before, the coop is very nice and the survival too, but it was such a dissapointment to see only 2 survival maps, fortunately, new came in updates. Here comes the moment to talk about deathmatch, it is very sucky, the damages are not balanced, the collisions are crap and the maps are not so good, the deathmatch gameplay is very bad. If you play SS for deathmatch, don't play this one but if you like coop and new things, this game is for you. I personnaly don't like as much as the other Serious Sam games this one.

												Pros:•New styles for killing mobs, Mutilator, melee, etc.•Steam Workshop to help enhance the game if wanted•Masterful Soundtrack•Every level has some secrets to find. Who doesn't love secrets?!•Can either play in First Person or Third Person with a single hit of a button!•Awesome environment detail from either outside or inside•16 Player Multiplayer sounds beast right? Right!•Has 100% controller support; Can switch from controller or keyboard without restarting the game.Cons:•The humor in the game is a bit ""dry"" compared to the other games.•Game seems easier on Serious difficulty over the older games (First/Second Encounter)•Some of the more higher tier mobs are used as bosses with basically more health.•A few weapons are found only in secrets. (So go find them!)----After you think you've done everything with the game fetching all the achievements possible (Completing Serious difficulty, All Secrets, Old School Mode, Survival Gold Medals, etc.) you should try and complete the game on ""Mental x84"" Difficulty. No health, armor, 400% more mob health, etc. That's when things get Serious!9/10 Fantastic game.			",118,7,2,11,3,0,12

												Maybe i'm the only one who likes this game? Well ok.I have enjoied the Serious Sam franchise, and own all of them (i think? i may be mising a fan made 2d one) If you enjoied the older ones, you'll definately like this one.Gory. You can rip out hearts, eye-balls, crush spiders, play with sledge hammers and miniguns.Split-screen is a great feature in this game. It makes co-op very fun.This is a old-school shooter. With some nice looking graphics, destructable worlds, and a fun story line.I got though most of the campaighn, and played a bunch of co-op also.Multiplayer is kind of dead, but there's a few people who still play.Co-op with a friend is fun, and one of the only shooters with split-screen support on PC makes this game more fun. (and we don't have to buy 2 copies to play together :P)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Old-school (sod storyline, mindset or aristotelian character development, just shoot everything that moves). Hordes of enemies. ""teh LOLz"" when you first meet some of them.

												Do you like first-person shooters, but hate all the modern ""improvements"" that the era of Call of Battlefield: Medal of Halo Forever has brought us, such as regenerating health, the ""ability"" to only hold onto two weapons at a time, and bland generic enemies? Do you want to face an insane amount of enemies with an equally insane amount of weapons, including a ♥♥♥♥ING CANNON? Were you disappointed by Duke Nukem Forever in any way? Then this is the game for you.The only modernizations that Serious Sam 3 went through were the additions of sprinting, melee attacks not involving a weapon, looking down iron sights of specific weapons (pistol and assault rifle), and reloading specific weapons (pistol, regular shotgun, assault rifle, and the Devastator), and these changes feel kind of... welcome, as they aren't abused. Other than that, it's a Serious Sam game. And it is ♥♥♥♥ing glorious.			",508,108,16,64,51,6,68

												I had forgotten how addicting a good game could be, since Serious Sam 2. 2 mounths ago, i bought my new highend PC and i saw this game on steam. And then i said: ""Is there a third installement of Serious Sam?"" ""Seriously?"" After that i saw the trailer with all the ""AAAAAAAAA"" and i bought it immediatelly. And now the verdict.... Yep, the game has not the greatest story ever told.(if i want a good story, i will see a movie or i will read a book)Yep, the graphics are very good but not the best i 've ever seen.(if i want great graphics, i will play Mass Effect 3 and i will sleep on my chair in an hour)What is Serious Sam 3 then?Serious Sam 3 is: funny, fast paced, addicting, brilliant,clever,mindblowing,and most of all... different.After a  lot of years, i catched myself loughing again with the lines of a game hero and remember them, the other day at work (loughing again).If this is not a good reason to buy a game, what is?My score is 10/10Good work CROTEAM....For the third time			",31,0,0,4,0,0,9

												Game Play: 1st person shooter. Kill everything you see. Carry all the weapons you picked up.Map design: Linear. Maps are huge. Serious Sam series contain the largest map of any FPS. Serious Sam 3: BFE is no exception.How Long To Beat It: Around 22 hours on normal single player. Difficulties On Normal: Very few can solo it on normal . Even on easy it is extremely hard to solo.Kids Rating: Violence. Lots of blood. Swearing. Nudity.Bugs: Crashed one or twice.Game Control: Standard.Save System: Check Point, Auto, and Manual Save System. You can save the game at anytime and anywhere. No limit on save files. Manual save keep the frustration level down.Option Menu: Full control of video and audio.Recommend Buying Price: $5 or lower for general public. $25 or lower for players that loves very hard old style FPS shooter.---I've beaten all three Serious Sam games. Serious Sam 1 is the hardest follow by Serious Sam 3: BFE, and finally Serious Sam 2. Even experts FPS players will have a hard time soloing any Serious Sam games. However in co-ops it is beatable for most players.Serious Sam 3 provide the same classic weapons of it predecessors. From pistol to rocket launcher to cannon balls and everything in between. Like its predecessors you can carry and use all the weapons you pick up. There is no weapon carry limit.The basic game play in all Serious Sam game is the survival of the mob rush. Hundreds of enemies some of them the size of skyscraper will be barreling down on you. Surviving these constant attacks is hard and harder at the end of the game.Not many players can solo Serious Sam games. The alternative way of beating Serious Sam game is to go co-op. Co-op reduce the difficulties and frustration.			",2670,1143,99,304,381,29,449

												This game, at first I thought would be just an average run-of-the-mill kinda game... but oh my god I was wrong. It's the hardest game I have ever played.The story consists of aliens taking over your planet I think? I'm totally new to the Serious Sam﻿ series but I got the general idea that the world's gone to hell and everything's an alien. You, the protagonist, have to set off to do some magic wonders and escape.. ahem.. lead a slaughter onto the alien race that have invaded the dearly beloved Earth as we know.The first missions are pretty bleak, you're thrown right in at the deep end with no instructions... no map, no real sense of direction, just given a big hammer and infinite swarms of enemies. No, SERIOUSLY (enough puns) you'll be challenged to have to find and activate the invisible enemy spawners yourself (can be found by taking your time through each level) of which will spawn very difficult waves of enemies to fight in limited resources. As the level goes on, you need to hunt badly for health, armour and ammo (and ofc guns) to take on all of the bad guys in the game and fight an array of different creatures such as overgrown Arachnids, Skeleton Rhinos, Mutant Scorpions and my favourite, the Mental Screaming Guy. Very gory and arcade-based, you'll likely be measuring this to the likes of Duke Nukem due to it's cheesy and ""serious"" storyline, as well as the overall feel very much handles the same however Serious Sam isn't a game to be messed with. I have found this game to be VERY difficult, even as I'm playing on Normal, I've dropped it to Tourist mode and still find completing levels very hard. I'm not sure if it bugs out as cutscenes fail to play or...?It's a heavy-modded game to the PC, a very fun game to get. If you're looking for a reasonably cheap shooter you can net in a bundle or worth to wait for a Steam Sale that will most certainly drive you insane with difficulty, I recommend this game.

												This game feels like the closest to a real retro shooter with modern visuals in our day and age, it really does, and as someone who have played a few of those, I feel that this kind of game is what most retro FPS veterans wants in their modern shooters. With its maze like levels full with exploration to find secrets and the way to progress, hordes of interesting enemies and bosses with a great variety and an arsenal of weapons. AND YES YOUR HEALTH DOESNT MAGICALLY REGENARATE, you have to find supplies yourself and the same goes with ammo. I have played Duke Nukem 3D and this game feels a lot like it. It may not be a perfect modern-retro shooter, but I think that its the closest we have right now.I cant say a lot about the story and the character since I havent played the previous titles. But for me the story was really that you would expect from a retro shooter and Sam.. oh Sam.. He is so serious! I didnt expect a deep story I just wanted to kick♥♥♥♥♥and chew bubblegun, but since this isnt Duke Nukem, I was all out of gum, and instead I got an awesome first person shooter with a kick♥♥♥♥♥protagonist! I recommend you play it with friends, it doesnt add anything to the story you are just playing as 2-16 Sams, but it is still pretty fun and a great experience with its 16 player max coop (I only played with one though)!This kind of game is what I believe a lot of retro gamers (including myself) hoped/expected to see in the sequel of the amazing Duke Nukem 3D, which we sadly didnt get.

												Read the other reviews to hear about the gameplay, etc.  Fact is this game a tons of fun.  But what most of those reviews fail to mention is how awesome the audio is.  Probably the best audio of any game I have played.  From the ambient background sounds while you're creeping through the ghettos of Egypt, to the sounds of C4 exploding, cannonballs blasting....all the way to the heavy metal soundtrack during the intense battles.....the sounds just fit the game perfectly.  And I do mean perfectly.You'll never hear ""WAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"" the same way........			",66,8,4,9,9,0,8

												I had forgotten how addicting a good game could be, since Serious Sam 2. 2 mounths ago, i bought my new highend PC and i saw this game on steam. And then i said: ""Is there a third installement of Serious Sam?"" ""Seriously?"" After that i saw the trailer with all the ""AAAAAAAAA"" and i bought it immediatelly. And now the verdict.... Yep, the game has not the greatest story ever told.(if i want a good story, i will see a movie or i will read a book)Yep, the graphics are very good but not the best i 've ever seen.(if i want great graphics, i will play Mass Effect 3 and i will sleep on my chair in an hour)What is Serious Sam 3 then?Serious Sam 3 is: funny, fast paced, addicting, brilliant,clever,mindblowing,and most of all... different.After a  lot of years, i catched myself loughing again with the lines of a game hero and remember them, the other day at work (loughing again).If this is not a good reason to buy a game, what is?My score is 10/10Good work CROTEAM....For the third time			",31,0,0,4,0,0,9

												Serious Sam in altbewährter Gemetzel Manier. Diesmal sogar mit sehr ansehnlicher Grafik. Solo Kampagne ist in 10 Stunden zu schaffen was ich als recht kurz empfinde. Der Multiplayer bietet neue kreative Spielmodi, doch wird im Allgemeinen Serius Sam im Internet leider nicht oft gespielt.Insgesamt empfehlenswert für Gamer die gerne mal ihren Frust in From von endlos Ballereien los werden möchten ;-)			",115,57,1,5,11,0,9

												While at a glance, this game looks like another generic brown and grey shooter and Croteam completely sold out to appease the COD crowd, this game is absolutley like it's predecessors. Sure you can sprint for an indifinite period of time, and you can  aim down sights (I actually really like ADS), but rest assured, everything about this game is Serious Sam. You still fight hordes upon hordes upon hordes of enemies while utilizing a metric ♥♥♥♥ton of weaponry in gigantic environments. I'm not sure whether the modern city environments were either a send up to modern shooters or in fact a very clever message about the state of shooters today though. Multiplayer is pretty cool. There weren't too many people playing versus, so I didn't get the chance to try that out. Co-op on the other hand... You can have up to 16 people playing. While the most I've ever gotten to try out was 8 people (unfortunately, not very many people play multiplayer at all in this game), it was still an absolute blast having so many people contribute to a mindless violent orgy. This game is also quite well optimized, as I get a consitent 30 FPS on my craptop. Ths game is also on the 360, where I played the game's splitscreen (the PC version also has splitscreen, a very commendable move on Croteam's part) with a friend of mine who happens to be a big fan of COD, but is still very willing to try new things. I don't think I've ever heard him laughing so hard mindlessly mutilating enemies with miniguns and killer jewlery. The PC version also has excellent gamepad support, something more PC games should have. The only real issue I have with this game is it's pacing. It takes about 2 to 3 levels for the game to finally hit it's stride. Sure, this a sequence in the first level that reminds you that this is a Serious Sam game, but the next level is without a doubt, the weakest level in the entire game, if not the entire series. But after that travesty, the rest of the game picks up, and when it picks up, it's one hell of a ride. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone and everyone who is a fan of shooting things until they expire. Great game, thanks.			",217,19,5,4,2,2,3

												Serious Sam 3 BFE is seriously one of the best games of its genre and, in all seriousness, an example of how a perfectly built gameplay should be. There is tons of action of course, with cazillions of enemies to battle, especially on the higher difficulty levels, but there is also a good deal of exploration and discovery, together with beautiful and atmospheric sceneries - the post-apocalyptic cities and towns are incredible. You really need to try this game on the harder modes if only to see for yourself how the cleverly made environments, as long as you take advantage of them the best way, are actually your secret ""allies"" in fighting all those enemies that may seem, on first look, impossible to deal with. There are numerous easter eggs, bigger or smaller nods to many other games, and Sam's hilarious lines. The game has many secrets to look for - some are very easy to find, others require some search. And of course there is the music, one of the most epic and majestic soundtracks you've ever listened, and in particular the masterpiece that is the final boss fight piece.			",34,4,0,0,0,0,0

												When all is said and done, Serious Sam 3 is just plain refreshing. It's nice to have a game that relies so much on flat-out enemy decimation, and which does it so well, so beautifully, and while providing at least the opportunity to share the experience with friends online. If you're weary of todays high profile first person shooters and their endless hype, Serious Sam 3's endless enemies and endless ammo are the perfect antidote. Serious Sam 3 is a game that deserves to be played, because it shows what shooters were and could have been. It shows that there's more to the genre than what AAA developers have shown us in the past decade.Pure mayhem, pure fun, pure Serious Sam, pure first-person shooting.			",2260,866,87,236,310,22,349

												Serious Sam 3: BFE is the latest addition to Serious Sam franchise, still being a horde-based FPS. And it's a prequel to the first game plot-wise, whoop! BFE is abbrovation for Before First Encoutner, they say. It came out in 2011, being made by Croteam. And it's serious!It also came out for Xbox 360 and PS3. Probably nothing to check out here, maybe it supports less players in multiplayer.Multiplayer community is still there. They mostly play coop all the time. Coop survival is less played. And you are likely to get Versus game only on some hours, who knows, it's not as liked by general people. No one plays modded version of game.That, or you can call your friend to play in split-screen anyway.And yes, you are once again Sam Stone, who is now wearing cool sunglasses. And this time you are going to kill many Mental's minions and maybe rip some eyes. To save the earth! Maybe. As long as you stay serious. Seriously serious!And yep, it now goes back to more realistical setting than Serious Sam 2. And you know what? It's awesome. It's like exactly what I always wanted the next installment of Serious Sam back when I was a fan of the first game, before Serious Sam 2 destroyed the dreams. I mean, cmon, you get to play Serious Sam prequel where you shoot kamikazes in ruined town. It's awesome!And music is still awesome and atmospheric, though this time more forgettable. And scenes are epic. And graphics are great.Then again, some complain that it might be a bit too serious. But I think it's on same level as The First Encounter. It's belivable plot combined with jokish secrets. And small details. That, and yes, it also has dark tomb levels where player even has slower movement speed, being interesting to explore for a change. No worries, it's not Doom 3. And I can agrue that it brought back memories of the third level of First Encounter which is part of what I liked as well. So I am very happy as a fan here.It also added some more of modern gameplay elements into it. At least this is what our usual gamers would call them. But they aren't used as much as one might think and mostly is true only for low-tier weapons.  You can aim with assault rifle and pistol down the sight, which slows you down but makes accuaricy perfect. No worries, minigun still doesn't require any aiming and is accurate like sniper rifle.Few guns also require reloading. It actually fits to pistol and Devastator, a fast-shooting 20-ammo-in-mag explosive railgun thing.  For single-barreled shotgun and assault rifle? Not much. It does make early levels more interesting, having to worry about reloading as rare enemy charges at you. But on bad side, they become mroe painful to use in later levels, so you don't want to change from stronger Double-Shotgun and Minigun. Ok, at least Assault Rifle and Minigun use different ammo, so here is at least ""saving ammo"".But sprinting is actually a very good addition to Serious Sam franchises. Did you ever think ""ok, so it has good speed during battles and I enjoy these huge levels but once I killed everybody walking from one corner of huge valley to another to get all secrets is soooo boring""? Yep, we now have infinite sprint. You can't shoot and can run only forward. So during battle when you dont' sprint the speed and balance is similar to older Serious Sam. And sometimes you can sprint to take a new position, as each arena is much bigger here. It's actually the first Serious game where you can outrun kamikazes this way. And outside of battle it makes it less boring to explore enviroment, taking less time to move on. Perfect addition.And yea, melee kills. They have no gameplay bonus like health regeneration, so you mostly do it for fancyness. After battle. They are tasteful, not as awful as Brutal Doom, no worries.Yep, it's still a good new Serious Sam game. You get new toys to play with. C4 is awesome addition, being hugely explosive. Having a lot of destructable decorations and columns helps to make it super awesome. New enemies. New balance to learn and master. Maybe ""space monkeys"" that hide behind columns is a bit unfitting to Serious Sam, but they help with variety and motivate you to destroy columns. And hey, new feature weapon, mutilator, is kinda fancy, where you lasso few enemies and they expode after some time of charging up energy. Whoop!Levels are much bigger this time around. Or more exactly, each room is bigger. You aren't as much closed down into arena and you got a lot of room to move. Or even unrestricted at all, which is very different from what we had before. It's still linear, but it's awesome.The only big flaw is how slow and weak the first third of a game is. They go way too slow with giving player new weapons to try out. I mean, I love when I don't get flooded with weapons and options, letting me to savour low-tier weapons for a while. But Serious Sam has two levels in straight where you only have only one non-basic weapon - single-barreled shotgun. And in both levels you fight bulletspongy bosses. Other Serious games would have given you new weapon by that time, letting you think ""what should I use in this situation"". Really, this is one case where removing a level would have made overall game better.And yep, this game also includes survival game mode that you can play in single-player or cooperatively. Around five maps. Two of them even have you starting with little weapons, slowly giving you stronger enemies and weapons. It's a good fun.Then there are cooperative modes, with infinite respawn or with limited lives. It's a good fun and people will be happy to find out that this time coop mode has cutscenes from single-player as well, which are also skippable. Finally! Not to mentioning that you can play with friend in split-screen.It has versus mode as well. I am not exactly fan of it, the first impession was horrible. Server with infinite ammo and map that has C4 mix awfully. Neither does map where you can exploit to get into rooftop and spam C4. Then there is a level which is nothing but tomb corridors, because all yay super-shotgun reflex and no maneuvering. And Trouble map from old games is now looking both ugly and there are less ways to move due to different physics and scale.But in other maps? Yep, it's still a good fun. No worries, no melee fatalities in this one. It's not terribly unique either, sadly, but it's fun.Overall, it's an awesome game that I always wanted to get as fan of Serious Sam 1. While it has a flaw or few, it's epic and I love that it explores the setting of modern Serious Sam universe before he time travelled. It has that slight apocalypstic feel to it and is just plain Serious. Doesn't dissapoint gameplay-wise either. Thanks, Croteam.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												I heard about the game, when I was young, but never played it. Dont know why. When I first saw it on Steam I thought ""Thats awesome! But a lot of bad games look that awesome first.""But this game was actually, what it told on the Steam Shop page.It has a completely irrelevant storyIt has a lot of enemysA lot of big gunsYou will never let go of your left mouse keyeverything is coopAll in all its the most senseless and most fun shooter, Ive ever played. It takes the irony of pushed-over-the-limit action, overly masculine characters of modern film and gaming to a whole new level and make a nice not too offensive (unlike Duke Nukem) Joke about it.In the game you destroy everything, from a skyscraper sized spaceship, the sphinx up to to a building sized boss. And thats mostly everything of the game. You run through (mostly very open) one way levels, killing everything, that gets in range and make it to the end of the level.Very impressive is the ability to shoot (most of) your surroundings into pieces, wrecking complete ancient egyptic temples.Being an old type of game genre, you have no lifereg (only on the lowest difficulty) and always have to look for guns and ammunition (there are secrets and specials all over the map, like the laser gun and the sniper rifle).Playing it in coop with other players, doing competitions, speedruns, deathruns and achievments, you can have a lot of fun, if you like just shooting massive waves of enemys.

												This is one of my top favorite games ever played on Steam.  It's got some story behind it which is pretty basic.  Serious Sam kicking♥♥♥♥♥on a mission.  The graphics and sound I think is pretty darn good.  I really dig the background music.  I own all the Serious Sam games and they all rock. This game is pretty much about blazing down and blowing up TONS of enemies flying at you.  Sometimes it's like mission impossible with all the enemies trying to kill you.  Plan on getting killed and killing a lot.  They have level difficulties from hard to get yourself killed to them disappearing at times in such large hords you wonder why you selected it.  You can also up how strong the enemies are plus a ton of other game options like infinite ammo, limited lives, etc.They have death match, 16-player co-op, survival, etc game modes.  I run a dedicated server for it.  The main game mode I play is co-op.  Played a lot of 16-player co-op games that were a blast.  Some parts of it are very easy to get lost.  Especially when you go underground.  You can learn a lot playing co-op with others.  Lots of hidden places to find.  The DLC pack is good.The developers are still active patching and improving this game.  The support on their steam community page is top notch.  There is also a workshop for this game if you like to play with game mods.  It's worth playing if you like old school shooters.  Serious Sam 4 is coming out 2017 and I'm looking forward to it!!

												Serious Sam 3: BFE is a brutal shooter set in Cairo, featuring Sam having to deal with a breakout of rampaging aliens.PROS:+ Quite long gameplay (easily 10 hours on just singleplayer)+ Awesome unimaginably overlord weaponry, as well as a decent variety in weapons to use+ Great dose of humor+ Nice graphics+ There is LOTS to shoot. Thousands of enemies per level if not+ Elimination of annoying physics like recoil (that's right, there's no recoil or spread)+ The multiplayer co-op is actively visited and servers are always availabe for both BFE campaign and the DLC campaign+ Tons of secret areas and hidden items+ Expandable with DLC+ Bonus material available (OST, concept art, ""making of"" videos, etc.)+ Trading cardsCONS:- Gameplay is a lot the same, except for the changing locations and areas- The story is very generic and cliché, but that's due this game revolving around the shooting massacre and is done somewhat on purpose- For a game that has a lot of secrets that you often have to jump and climb to, the jumping in BFE is pretty terrible- Although it does have pretty good music, it has very little variety in itA prequel to a classic and beloved series of FPS, set in a somewhat arcade style. A must for anyone who enjoys action and shooters in general.My rating: 8.5/10			",134,25,0,5,5,1,3

												As someone who has been following the Serious Sam series since I first played Serious Sam on the original Xbox, I feel like this game is the most unlike the rest of the series, but in a bad way. We don't talk about Serious Sam 2, because that was also a game that went too off the wall. This version feels like it's getting sucked in to the modern shooter formula. It is still very much Serious Sam at its core - Hundreds of enemies on screen at once where the only tactic is to shoot them all down while strafing the whole time  - it forgets that part of the series' merit was in its humor and overall vibrance as well as the multiple areas featured in the game (like in the first two, where the progression was Egypt > South America > Medieval Europe and the GC/PS2 game was Ancient Rome > Ancient China > Atlantis). The default color settings leave the game in a boring, washed-out, brown and grey world. Thankfully, there's a ""vibrant"" setting that gives the game the color it needs. The jokes have been copy-pasted and some are downright cringeworthy. I will say, this has to be the more difficult game in the series, with the last few levels being downright unforgivable at some points. It's still a Sam game, and I have to credit it for still sticking to its original formula, but shame it for adding modern shooter features like Iron Sight aiming, muted brown and gray colors, and ""military hard♥♥♥♥♥character."" Oh, and the two most unforgivable sins in this game: 1) they left out the Serious Bomb and 2) they gave Sam douchelord wraparound sunglasses.			",171,11,4,2,3,1,4

												You fight over 100000000+ demons thrown at your face in large scale terrains. The game does not give a rats @ss on how much ammo or health you got left. Cause it's totally your fault if you're down to 2 health and low on ammo. F**k your feelings. IF you're looking for an oldschool run and gun FPS like the new Doom. Give this one a go.

												I'll get straight to the point and say - this game is the worst in the series. There are so many things wrong with this one. Ho Lee Sheet.Cons: Graphics are decent at most with too much contrast for my taste. Lighting is so off in some areas. Sometimes you literally see just black areas and nothing more. Sledgehammer animation is just bad. It can easily give you motion sickness. There are a handful of areas where you are in some caves or dark tunnels and you can only see a small radius with the help of your flashlight. Everything else is just pitch black. Every second you live with the hope that soon you will find a way out of this mess. NO FUN. Ugh! You can't reload your guns while sprinting! That's the dumbest thing I can imagine in a fps game. Especially in this one where you have to fight against 20 enemies swarming at you at the same time. This makes guns like pistol, pump-action shotgun and assault rifle much less preferable to play with.  When you use melee to finish of an enemy - you dash a little bit forward and sometimes it even changes the direction you are facing afterwards. Performance isn't good either. I can play many 2016 AAA games on max settings without any big frame drops, but this game is like a rollercoaster. You can go down from 100 fps to 60 fps in the blink of an eye. Bad level design. Seriously. it's linear open-world'ish, but so frustrating to play in. The city part is so cluttered with random stuff and rubbish that it makes your eyes bleed. The desert is far from being good too (+f so many dark areas). The last level is just lazy on so many levels. When you have to find some items in order to progress the level - they will always be at the end of the map. You kill hundreds of enemies of the same type by going there and when you pick that item - another sh|tload of them spawns on your way back... All the fights consist of spamming the same enemies over and over again. Most of the time (like 95%) is like this: Kill 20 enemies of this type, then 20 enemies of other type, and what the hell - here is another 50 of them!.. The last level takes this formula and quadruples it three times. If you play it - you will understand what I mean.  Enemies. I always hated the Skeletons in all of the Serious Sam games, they are just frustrating. But this game makes even more of these kind of enemies. Skeletons, time-stopping Witch-Brides and Space Monkeys - are the absolute worst enemies in FPS history. There is no joy in playing vs those things. I literally just skipped all those monkeys. I think this decision saved me a year of my human life. Very tedious gameplay (especially the last level). This game is like a considerably worst version of Doom (2016).Pros: The ""feel"" of the weapons is cool. SS3 is one of those games where playing with the headphones will help you greatly (mostly because of kamikazes). Not an easy game. I played it on normal difficulty and it was quite challenging at times. Great amount of weapons. And you will need every single one.As for the last boss - it only looks dangerous, but it's very easy and can be killed very, very quickly. I had much more trouble with those Demonic beasts (Khnums) than him during the playthrough.			",387,103,12,43,37,8,62

												As an ""old"" FPS player who played quite a bit of Quake and Quakeworld back in the day, I really enjoyed Serious Sam 3: BFE. It is very satisfying to come home after a day's work and just start mowing down endless waves of enemies with whatever weapon you have, until it runs out... while running backwards... and evading Kleer Skeletons...The game gradually increases in difficulty. The first few maps are not that hard and slowly introduce you to the story, world, enemies and weapons, but later on it gets hard. It even got to a point where after trying the same part many, many times I considered cheating. In the end I didn't and I was able to pass it after some more tries. And this was on Normal difficulty...This is nowhere near a casual FPS where you just hold the fire button until everything is dead. It really pushes your senses and reflexes while fighting the various types of enemies. You need to localize and prioritize the enemies, keep an eye on your health and ammo, move, strafe, aim and fire.If you like fast paced FPS action with a bit of humor, Serious Sam 3: BFE is definately a game you need to play!

												This is the game.Serious Sam 3: BFE (Before First Encounter)The prequel to one of the best games on the planet so far.Follow Sam 'Serious' Stone on his journey through future Egypt, as Sam shoots, explodes, bludgeons & even tear his enemies to shreds with his bare hands.This game features intense skill-based combat against intelligent AI who will get faster, smarter and as a result more dangerous.Beat the game on Serious difficulty? You should try MENTAL difficulty argueable one of the most difficult difficulties in gaming so far. Enemies won't only be smart they'll also turn invisable for several seconds & re-appear making the already hard game almost crippling.If you are not able to handle the difficulty don't fret you can set the game to ""Tourist"" difficult in-order to experience the game's story line & fun game mechanicsAnother thing worth mentioning is every weapon in the game is satisfying to use even the little pistol you fire has a bit of ""Umph"" to it as you fire it, some weapons such as the Double Barrel Shotgun work well on enemies like Kleers but it's slow re-load time makes it un-reliable in fire fights where constant fire is required. The Multiplayer on the other hand is unbalanced at best, what it boils down to is: Who has the best gun, and even still it's still has some cheap shots in it.Other than that this game is up to 16 Player Co-operative mode which is insanely fun to play with freinds.This game gets a big yes from me and everyone should try it.

												OK yes, I loved all the Serious Sam games! The humor is entertaining the monsters are fun and irritating, and the blood is fantastic. I played through each one co-op first and as with any game playing with a friend is so much more fun. However this game is great as a single player as well and you don't just play it once and put it away. You can play it again and again and not get bored. The weapon variety is good and ammo, armor and health are all around. The most irritating monster the Kleer and those who have played know just who I mean, so watch out for him, and he is there a lot in abundance! Money spent on this game is money well spent as you will enjoy it!			",830,537,32,137,218,5,117

												Initial thoughts:With it's many play styles Serious Sam 3 BFE attempts to round out a problematic old style shooting model by creating a slow crawl of enemies and occasionally mixing in waves of enemies and bosses to keep things interesting. After playing more modern shooters it was odd to see such horrible targeting lead to successful kills. Serious mode seemed far to hard (to me) and easy difficulty was just going through the motions. So go through the motions I did. The game offers a nice array of different melee kill animations depending on the enemy being attacked. It's an interesting thought to consider that you can instantly kill anything with your bare hands, but it takes 2-3 handgun bullets by alternate means.A seasoned Sam:Things end up getting a little more intense near the end of the game and even easy mode can start getting a bit trying when enemies are simply everywhere.

												Serious Sam is ♥♥♥♥ing back and this time he is ♥♥♥♥ing kick♥♥♥♥♥Serious Sam TFE and TSE style! They realized they ♥♥♥♥ed up big with that cartoony♥♥♥♥♥♥sucking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that was Serious Sam 2. Consoles ruined that game so hard, but this time (as of right now) the game is PC only and back to being ♥♥♥♥ing awesome! Back to giant ♥♥♥♥ing maps, thousands of enemies, huge ♥♥♥♥ing guns, and tons of blood and gore! Read on ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. So they have the latest version of the Serious Engine which is 3.5 and the game looks ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous. When the enivornment has giant structures and expansive environments in the background, then fills with hundreds of enemies, the explosions, the gore and gibs make the game look ♥♥♥♥ing damn good. The facial animation blows complete chunks but I am pretty sure that no one is playing the game for any sort of facial animations. The enemies have tons of detail to them and get bloodier and fall apart in different ways depending on how you kill them. I love shooting a gnaar in the face with the double barrel and you see his head dissapear into chunks.The old classic weapons are all back with the shotgun and the ♥♥♥♥ing double barrel doing huge damage. The Thompson has been replaced by a more modern m4 type of weapon but essential serves the same purpose. Running around with a sledgehammer and smashing ♥♥♥♥ing heads is great and gives me a giant boner. I♥♥♥♥♥everytime I smash a new head in. The minigun and cannon are back and do huge ♥♥♥♥ing damage and shoot giant ♥♥♥♥ing cannon balls. There are also some new weapons like the Devestator which is a super awesome grenade launcher type weapon. For some reason the grenades are 100% accurate and shoot super fast but it is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome for blowing people away. The game also retains all the classic coop modes, death match and survival gameplay which give it hours and hours of replay value. I just hope someone creates the PARSE ERROR mod for this mother ♥♥♥♥er. Hell I'll pay to have super fast weapons and 20,000 enemies attacking all at once.All the old enemies make a return with beautiful ♥♥♥♥ing graphics, and so do the giant ♥♥♥♥ing bosses. The last boss is just as big as the boss in the first encounter and I cut his ♥♥♥♥ing head off all the same. There are some new enemies such as this fat pudgy ♥♥♥♥ that shoots rockets, or this telekenis ♥♥♥♥♥ who is a big pain in my dicksack. Good thing I can blow her ♥♥♥♥ing face off with a giant cannonball. All the levels are back to being ♥♥♥♥ing massive in scale (except for the first 3 levels which is meant to be a joke I think). The game retains pretty much the exact same gameplay as the first and second encounter, and it is fun. Also, it is ♥♥♥♥ing hard. I'm glad they made a ♥♥♥♥ing game which is actually challenging which seems to be a rare breed now days. Everyone wants to baby it for the dumbest people on the planet. Not in this game. PREPARE FOR HUNDREDS OF♥♥♥♥♥♥♥FLYING AT YOU AS YOU HAVE TO BLOW THEM ALL AWAY OR DIE. Serious Sam 3 brings Serious Sam back to what everyone ♥♥♥♥ing loves.

												I like this game quite alot, it's pretty true to the previous versions, the graphics are pretty good and you get very high frames per second.The story is weak but they were in the first games too.Co-Co is really fun, games are always better in Co-OpI sugest you turn off ""Motion Blur"" because it will probably just make you feal sick like it does for me.

												Initial thoughts:With it's many play styles Serious Sam 3 BFE attempts to round out a problematic old style shooting model by creating a slow crawl of enemies and occasionally mixing in waves of enemies and bosses to keep things interesting. After playing more modern shooters it was odd to see such horrible targeting lead to successful kills. Serious mode seemed far to hard (to me) and easy difficulty was just going through the motions. So go through the motions I did. The game offers a nice array of different melee kill animations depending on the enemy being attacked. It's an interesting thought to consider that you can instantly kill anything with your bare hands, but it takes 2-3 handgun bullets by alternate means.A seasoned Sam:Things end up getting a little more intense near the end of the game and even easy mode can start getting a bit trying when enemies are simply everywhere.

												Serious Sam is ♥♥♥♥ing back and this time he is ♥♥♥♥ing kick♥♥♥♥♥Serious Sam TFE and TSE style! They realized they ♥♥♥♥ed up big with that cartoony♥♥♥♥♥♥sucking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that was Serious Sam 2. Consoles ruined that game so hard, but this time (as of right now) the game is PC only and back to being ♥♥♥♥ing awesome! Back to giant ♥♥♥♥ing maps, thousands of enemies, huge ♥♥♥♥ing guns, and tons of blood and gore! Read on ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. So they have the latest version of the Serious Engine which is 3.5 and the game looks ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous. When the enivornment has giant structures and expansive environments in the background, then fills with hundreds of enemies, the explosions, the gore and gibs make the game look ♥♥♥♥ing damn good. The facial animation blows complete chunks but I am pretty sure that no one is playing the game for any sort of facial animations. The enemies have tons of detail to them and get bloodier and fall apart in different ways depending on how you kill them. I love shooting a gnaar in the face with the double barrel and you see his head dissapear into chunks.The old classic weapons are all back with the shotgun and the ♥♥♥♥ing double barrel doing huge damage. The Thompson has been replaced by a more modern m4 type of weapon but essential serves the same purpose. Running around with a sledgehammer and smashing ♥♥♥♥ing heads is great and gives me a giant boner. I♥♥♥♥♥everytime I smash a new head in. The minigun and cannon are back and do huge ♥♥♥♥ing damage and shoot giant ♥♥♥♥ing cannon balls. There are also some new weapons like the Devestator which is a super awesome grenade launcher type weapon. For some reason the grenades are 100% accurate and shoot super fast but it is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome for blowing people away. The game also retains all the classic coop modes, death match and survival gameplay which give it hours and hours of replay value. I just hope someone creates the PARSE ERROR mod for this mother ♥♥♥♥er. Hell I'll pay to have super fast weapons and 20,000 enemies attacking all at once.All the old enemies make a return with beautiful ♥♥♥♥ing graphics, and so do the giant ♥♥♥♥ing bosses. The last boss is just as big as the boss in the first encounter and I cut his ♥♥♥♥ing head off all the same. There are some new enemies such as this fat pudgy ♥♥♥♥ that shoots rockets, or this telekenis ♥♥♥♥♥ who is a big pain in my dicksack. Good thing I can blow her ♥♥♥♥ing face off with a giant cannonball. All the levels are back to being ♥♥♥♥ing massive in scale (except for the first 3 levels which is meant to be a joke I think). The game retains pretty much the exact same gameplay as the first and second encounter, and it is fun. Also, it is ♥♥♥♥ing hard. I'm glad they made a ♥♥♥♥ing game which is actually challenging which seems to be a rare breed now days. Everyone wants to baby it for the dumbest people on the planet. Not in this game. PREPARE FOR HUNDREDS OF♥♥♥♥♥♥♥FLYING AT YOU AS YOU HAVE TO BLOW THEM ALL AWAY OR DIE. Serious Sam 3 brings Serious Sam back to what everyone ♥♥♥♥ing loves.

												I will just start off by saying that I really enjoy this game.  It is a simple fps in common with a lot of the old school style fps games such as quake, or the SS1 first encounter or second encounter. Fast gun play, hordes of enemies running at you at once, strafe shooting, fun weaponry, ability to carry all the guns at once, and no wall hugging.  For someone who grew up playing old ID and Valve games, this is just what I needed.  A breath of fresh air in the age of little skill dumb'd down shooters trying to appeal to the common denominator.  The first few levels are pretty easy, but once you get past those, the game becomes a lot more like what the old Serious Sam games were...which is a great thing! The options menu is also very impressive, many different settings to change in case you are having some strange fps or compatibility issues. Also the game has split screen coop which is great if you have a friend over and want to destroy some of Mental's aliens.All in all, if you like FPS games and would like something more frantic and fast, pick it up.  I highly recommend it.			",408,84,6,44,47,2,55

												Serious Sam 3 is a fantastic game don't get me wrong. But upon retrospect the game really comes across as a squandered opportunity.The biggest issue I have with this game is it takes place in Egypt. The location of the first game. Having the game be a prequel to the first game really didn't make any sense to me, and I believe 3 would have been significantly stronger if they made it take place in a different location.This was something Serious Sam 2 oddly enough was stronger with. Serious Sam 2 took place in Alien locations that contrasted the Egypt and Jungle/Arctic/Medieval maps from TFE and TSE. In general the game is fine and a necessary improvement over the HD games. But I really wish Croteam took more risks with this game.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												If you are getting tired of the modern FPS formula, that is a two weapon limit, regenerating health, cover based shooting, etc., the Serious Sam games have always been great for taking a break. Serious Sam 3: BFE has all the old school styled FPS traits: holding an arsenal of weapons at once, fast paced projectile dodging, and exploring all the levels for any secrets you can find. It also has the frantic Serious Sam combat that makes these games so fun, with lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of enemies attacking you at the same time. It may sound unfair, but you're built like a tank, and it's a welcome change of pace from new-school's realistic-ish, combat with a couple of enemies hiding behind cover kind of gameplay. Especially when you co-op it with friends, it is a lot of fun to dodge through enemy rockets and fireballs while laying waste to hundreds of aliens.It does have it's flaws though. While this is certainly not the kind of game you play for the story, the story is very weak with too many cheesy lines for it's own good. Also, besides some execution kills you can perform on weaker enemies, it doesn't add much to the established gameplay of the other Serious Sam titles, and that's probably not really possible with an old-school styled FPS. Most unforgiveable though, the first impressions on the game are not that great, with the first two or three levels having few enemies and an overall closed in level design. Give it some time though, the levels will open up and it will start barraging you with aliens to slaughter.If you don't take yourself too seriously (pun intended) and are a bit tired of the common cover based shooting, this game is good for some fast paced, old school macho action.

This is a great place to start though, seriously. It seriously contains all of the serious elements seriously brought to the table in the best serious way. All of our serious monster friends are seriously still here to get seriously splattered. Serious Sam plays like a serious first person shooter arcade game...with serious waves of serious monsters always running at you, making the serious threat on your life grow more serious by the second.95/100Seriously Intense.

												Some of the best crazy FPS co-op action you will ever experience.  After a slow start you will face literaly hundreds of enemies in beautiful destructable environments.  Its intense, its visceral, its extremely satisfying.  Don't judge this game on the first few city levels, they are crap and not what this game is all about.  For the best experience ignore the single player and do a co-op campaign with friends on the hardest difficulty setting, infinite ammo, extra multiplayer monsters and extra monster difficulty.  The feeling of being back to back with a mate, miniguns roaring in tandem, gunning down more monsters than you thought it would be possible to have on screen is one that anyone who enjoys shooters should experience.

												The Short - This game is good, but not nearly half as good as the original First and Second Encounters.The Long- I still have the CD's of the original games that were made way back in 2001. those were the very first First-Person shooters I had ever played, they were what got me in to FPS games. I ave played those games non-stop, and I still play them the odd time today, the re-playability of the originals is much more than BFE. Serious Sam 2 is a different story. In the old games, you got to kill numerous bad guys with different health levels, and different weapons could kill them better, or not. You had to constantly change weapons to kill different monsters before they killed you, it was a fun and addicting challenge. But Serious Sam 3:BFE is not the same, you walk in to a corridor, and 40 Beheaded Rockiteers spawn at the exact same time, and you must kill them all with one shot killing one bad guy, that's no fun.  I don't want to sound like a complete butt, but here are my thoughts on Serious Sam 3:BFE...THE GOOD: The story is neat, it takes place as a prequel to the original games. The voice actor for Sam is the same guy as back in the old days, and all the characters (Mental's monsters) are more or less the same bad guys you loved to kill in the old games.THE BAD: I didn't like the reload function. I really didn't like that you have modern weapons, like a normal boring old sub-machine gun that looks just like any other out there today. You were never able to get enough ammo for weapons such as the Minigun for it to ever be useful like it was a powerhouse back in the old games,and NECTRISA has been significantly reduced to just an information system with no real meaning to the game. Please, bring her back, let her tell Sam what to do and where to go again! In the old games she gave you updated info and back story on bad guys and such, in BFE, he does nothing.  The music is made by the same guy who made the music for all of the Serious Sam games, and it's not bad, it's a bit repetitive, but I guess that's okay.  As I said earlier, I really hated mowing down 40 bad guys at once. PLEASE bring back the old ways where I would be stuck in a room as bad guys would spawn as I killed others.Overall, it's okay. I'm rather dissapointed in it, as it did not really feel like a Serious Sam game. It's not as good as it's predecessors, I hope Croteam is able to get back in the saddle and bring back the good old fashion carnage we loved.			",136,14,11,7,8,1,12

												Serious Sam 3 is a fantastic game don't get me wrong. But upon retrospect the game really comes across as a squandered opportunity.The biggest issue I have with this game is it takes place in Egypt. The location of the first game. Having the game be a prequel to the first game really didn't make any sense to me, and I believe 3 would have been significantly stronger if they made it take place in a different location.This was something Serious Sam 2 oddly enough was stronger with. Serious Sam 2 took place in Alien locations that contrasted the Egypt and Jungle/Arctic/Medieval maps from TFE and TSE. In general the game is fine and a necessary improvement over the HD games. But I really wish Croteam took more risks with this game.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												Fantastic game. Beautiful graphics and excellent multiplayer features. The gameplay itself is very simple ""run and shoot aliens"" stuff but it's extremely entertaining. It's proudly continuing the legacy of Doom. The game's plot is basic scifi. And it's only a good thing, since I love scifi. Serious Sam has always been about shooting aliens though, so the gameplay is more important than the plot in this case.			",26,0,0,0,3,0,2

												This game is prequel to Serious Sam series. Basically, this is FPS with simple goal: Kill anything what moves, and stop invasion of minions serving to one bad guy named Mental... There are many, many possible choices, how to do that: From pistols, shotguns and miniguns to bare hands or even parts of your enemies. As in Serious Sam 2, his 'serious' humour is.... Not so serious at all. Playstyle is easy, so you wont be like you dont know what to press. Also, many difficulties are quite good, and last 2 (Serious and Mental) are really hardcore, nearly unbeatable.To multiplayer.. That's something different. As you join in classic deathmatch, there is quite big chance you'll get smashed, and you will need to check the maps and learn how to pwn other players. Coop version of singleplayer missions are also nice.In my opinion this game is very good deal for that price. 9/10 ",29,2,1,3,1,1,2

												I enjoy all Serious Sam games but this game is just not the same. In the other SS games here are lots of monsters with a faster pace game with lots going on and more to explore and this seems to be a slowed down version with less monsters running at you. Yes the graphics are a step up and the best one so and the controls are easy to get used to and it is best played with your friends as alone it is boring. The price they want.... No. £14.99 is the price I think it should be because it is just not as good the other ones. Anyway yes I vote yes worth a play.			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

												If you are getting tired of the modern FPS formula, that is a two weapon limit, regenerating health, cover based shooting, etc., the Serious Sam games have always been great for taking a break. Serious Sam 3: BFE has all the old school styled FPS traits: holding an arsenal of weapons at once, fast paced projectile dodging, and exploring all the levels for any secrets you can find. It also has the frantic Serious Sam combat that makes these games so fun, with lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of enemies attacking you at the same time. It may sound unfair, but you're built like a tank, and it's a welcome change of pace from new-school's realistic-ish, combat with a couple of enemies hiding behind cover kind of gameplay. Especially when you co-op it with friends, it is a lot of fun to dodge through enemy rockets and fireballs while laying waste to hundreds of aliens.It does have it's flaws though. While this is certainly not the kind of game you play for the story, the story is very weak with too many cheesy lines for it's own good. Also, besides some execution kills you can perform on weaker enemies, it doesn't add much to the established gameplay of the other Serious Sam titles, and that's probably not really possible with an old-school styled FPS. Most unforgiveable though, the first impressions on the game are not that great, with the first two or three levels having few enemies and an overall closed in level design. Give it some time though, the levels will open up and it will start barraging you with aliens to slaughter.If you don't take yourself too seriously (pun intended) and are a bit tired of the common cover based shooting, this game is good for some fast paced, old school macho action.

It doesn't take itself to seriously and at times even points fun at itself, and this has always be part of the Serious Sam Series charm. CO-OP plays well and is enjoyable. Keeps all the main enemies from the first game as well as adding some welcome additions(♥♥♥♥ you Demon monkeys). Level design is well done and the graphics are actually pretty damn good.

												First person shooter Doom/Quake style, lot of enemies, lot of guns, a bit of humor, big open spaces, i played the campaing on the serious difficulty, i recommend play in that difficulty, the graphics are nice but is not too well optimized because has a lot of particles effects like dust and explosion remains that will drop your frames sometimes, but its okay, is playable, have lot of modes like survival, deathmatch, capture the flag and more, the online multiplayer is almost dead, but fortunately this game has split-screen multiplayer, you can play the campaign with friends, even survival mode (wich is so ♥♥♥♥ing hard), and every mode you can play it on split-screen, thats the best thing of this game in my opinion.The optimization is not the best, but its okay for me, has a lot of options to customize the graphic quality and the performance, the game is fun, hard, and has local split-screen, only for that i will give it a 9/10, but if it wouldnt have local split-screen would be a 6/10, because playing it alone you can get easily bored and the devs should had worked on the optimization of the game, its a very exigent GPU game, and the price is high, you should wait to a discount to buy it, as i did.

												In the end I enjoyed playing this game but at the beginning it was kind of a huge disappointment and still, even after accomplishing those last epic battles which reminds me of the good old days of SS:FE and SS:SE, I feel a bit betrayed by Croteam (aka whatever is left of it today).Not only are there boring and never ending sceneries of modern egyptian backyards which are having a certain touch of CallOfPoopy-like games (in other words: american ""ubersoldier"" Sam fights for ""freedom"" in an eastern country).They even destroyed the last chance to make this game an epic and worthy sucessor of the series by making the ancient egyptian pyramids and labyrinths completely dark, poorly detailed and filled with - without any doubt - one of the WORST kind of enemy in the history of videogames: Space Monkeys, a species of ape-like creatures which fight by hiding from the player for an almost intolerable period of time and when they FINALLY decide to attack... they hide again behind one of the many stonepillars.Most of the time I missed a lot of the old enemies and some of the awesome weapons of SSSE, like the Sniper Rifle, the Laser Gatling Cannon, the Flamethrower and the Grenade Launcher (no, I dont consider the Devastator an equal alternative, this thing is just imba and boring).If you are waiting for something as simple as a Knife or just a second pistol, well, forget it. The double barreled shotgun is, like in every game, a life-saving fella though.Oh and the Syrian Mutilator? Seriously? More like ""Syrian Slowly-Waste-Away-ilator"". If it takes up to 5 seconds or more to kill a simple beheaded guy that thing is just a better wristwatch.Pros:Later in the game the battles get more challenging and get almost close to those of the older SS games. Even the leveldesign gets more interesting when the modern egyptian suburbs are being displaced by ancient egyptian buildings. I wish they would have done that from the very beginning.If there was a button like ""neutral"", I would choose that for my review.Oh and PS: This game lacks a lot of color.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Is that the voice of Optimus Prime I hear when  the game first start? I thought that Serious Sam 2 was awesome,  SS3 blows it off the planet. Extremely fast pace, good graphics, great smooth controls, good trading cards. Single Player is really good. It has two modes story mode and survival.  There is also multiplayer PvP and Co-op.  The load screens are kinda long, but I won't hold that against the game. There are also some good mods for the games. I'm very satisfied with this purchase. One important thing: Do Not Hit The Red Barrels with your Sledgehammer. That is very bad. 10/10.			",1119,447,27,150,145,7,166

												There are no excessive cutscenes here, not force in your face""deep"" story, no quick events, no magical regenerating health - just pure, uncontrolled, crazy, old school fun. This is how the games should be made. SS3 is FPS masterpiece with great graphics, awesome monsters, epic soundtrack, and tons of funny lines from the main character. One of the best shooting games I have ever played next to DooM. Words cant describe how much fun I had with Serious Sam.Also the crazy weapon choices will blow your mind. This is Serious people!

												This prequel to the Serious Sam series is amazingly crafted with elements of modern shooters but is balanced out with an extremely old school gameplay style of running and gunning. For anybody thinking of getting into the oldschool FPS genre, this is the perfect stepping stone, and is a must buy for anybody who is already a fan of oldschool shooters!			",102,3,1,0,2,0,2

TL;DRAn oldschool FPS with hordes of aliens to annihilate.+ Intensity+ Solid mechanics+ Loads of enemies+ Vast weaponry+ Multiplayer- A bit mind-numbing in longer sessionsREVIEWSerious Sam 3: BFE is an oldschool FPS with a few modern elements here and there. This game takes the player back to the time when Quake ruled the FPS world: no health regeneration, loadouts, radar, or quest arrow. Everything one needs to begin the massive extermination of monsters are to be found somewhere in the levels. Moreover, there are tons of secret areas so keep a lookout for them.The story is very straightforward: the protagonist, Sam Stone, is on a quest to stop the Mental's invasion on Earth. The game is set in Egypt so expect a lot of sandy areas and labyrinths. The player will find a variety of weapons throughout the game: sledgehammer, pistol, shotguns, minigun, explosives, etc. Despite being oldschool overall, the game has the option to aim down sights (ADS), sprint, and manual reload*. Speaking of variety, there are many types of aliens to obliterate, ranging from kamikazes and rocketeers to gnaars and kleer skeletons. The game can be very intense and I do not recommend long sessions, for it may become a bit mind-numbing.Apart from the single player campaign, the game features a co-op (up to 16 players) campaign, survival, and PvP multiplayer. It is important to keep in mind that the more the players there are in co-op, the stronger the enemies. Survival is a mode where the players have to defend themselves from waves of aliens and the PvP multiplayer features classic modes like deathmatch, capture the flag, and so on. It relies on peer-to-peer connection so it may get very laggy.All in all, I recommend playing this game. The solid mechanics, hordes of enemies, and a wide selection of weaponry provide hours of fun, especially in the co-op mode. It also happens to be on sale fairly often.*There is an achievement for finishing the game ""ol' style"", meaning no sprinting, reloading, or aiming down sights.P.S.

Short version: 82%Serious Sam 3: BFE takes us back to the roots of the series with all the elements that made the First Encounter a cult classic: no-nonsense attitude with a perfect dose of nonsense humour; classic weapons from the double-barrel shotgun to the cannon; and tricky level designs filled to the brim with secrets. This game is definitely not for the CoD generation of gamers, but if you ever want to experience what an old-school FPS was like, don’t look further.Long version:Forget CoD with its corridors, 10-minute long cut scenes, infinite ammo for the only two available weapons, cover systems and magical self-healing. Serious Sam 3: Before First Encounter is an old-school shooter where the levels are non-linear and feature many hidden spots, where your cover is your armour count, where your health is replenished by walking over medkit pickups, and where your large arsenal is only limited by the amount of ammo you can find.The only modern features BFE uses are the sprint button and limited weapon magazine size– although older gamers and Serious Sam purist can play the game without these, and they are even awarded with an achievement for it. As the sub-title suggests, BFE is a prequel telling us how Sam travelled back to ancient Egypt at the beginning of First Encounter, so thankfully we can forget about the Sirian Council and all the other stupidity of Serious Sam II. The tone is quite dark– mostly emphasised by the ruined, desolate city landscapes you fight in–, and the bad action movie one-liners and humorous Easter eggs are only meant to ease the tension a little bit.In other words, BFE is a lot closer to the First Encounter than any other Serious Sam games, probably making it the second best instalment in the whole series.

												This game is sick, it is messed up in many ways. Most of the things happening can only be described as ""WTF"".This game is amazing, yes its is sick, but in a good way. Non-stop action, constant killing of alien freeks.                        10/10 in terms of action with the ""one more"" syndrome.But if you are not one of the people that does not like constant killing, I dont recomend it, although the story is quite intersting and the game is more dificult than it seems to be.

												7.5/10 - Great Gore/ Bullet Hell. Not really into this kind of game, but I was impressed! Graphics were better than I'm used to with this style. The storyline is fluid and entertaining. If I had friends I can promise coop would be really fun!! I got for $10ish... listed for $40. I would try to find a price in the middle $25 or less.

												Need a game that features excessive gory kills, annoying decapitated kamikaze soldiers, cyclop aliens in which you can stick your fist in and rip out their eyes, topless harpy chicks, and a portable cannon that can slaughter hordes of enemies? The aforementioned outrageous sh!t is  all here in Serious Sam 3: BFE. It's a fine game to rush around and kill anything that walks around and attacks you. For that purpose, wield a 10 round Desert Eagle, a coachgun that can blast most enemies in one hit, a normal assault rifle, or a minigun and turn them into ""Alien hamburger meat"". If a gun doesn't work, then use an ancient bracelet and make enemies explode from the inside-out. Co-op is satisfying and it was very fun to play with a couple of buddies. Unlike some games, there is a ""compass"" in which it will inform you where and how far your pals are. This is very helpful when scouting around for hidden areas or to provide support. Once you experience SS 3 with a trusted friend, you don't ever want to go solo (again). Serious Sam 3: BFE did have some disappointing qualities. The level design is not impressive (especially for the underground ruins). Newcomers, like me, will have frustrations and tend to run around the map in circles when trying to find something to make progress. As the game progress, it will then spam large amounts of enemies. To me, this is mostly annoying and repetitive. Sure, you may more targets to eliminate but it quickly becomes unnecessary to endure. The A.I. has some bugs. A couple of enemies tend to get stuck or have troubles to choosing a target (if there are more than 2 players). Furthermore, their intelligence is mostly predictable and too easily exploited. The plot is very thin and is forgettable. Unless you're a fan of the series for a long time, it will make you confused. To make matters worse, the dialogue is ""cheesy"" and the stale characters are not interesting (well, save for Sam as he's serious enough to be a main character). Still, if you want a game to play with friends and fight hordes of aliens, then get SS 3 at a discount. $49.99 for the game itself is too much considering my cons.			",112,9,1,12,6,1,8

Всё вогруг мрачно и серо.На последних уровнях врагов на столько много, что от битвы устаешь сразу. Получается смертельно раздражающая рутина. В одиночной кампании есть кооператив  на 16 игроков.

												Fantastic game and worthy addition to the Serious Sam franchise. My only big gripes are:1. The addition of annoying hitscan soldiers and helicopters (Thankfully there is a mod to fix that)2. The first half of the game is seriously lame with very few enemies (for a Serious Sam game)Also can someone please explain to me how a small indie team with limited budget can manage to make such an amazing looking game on an in-house engine while AAA devs cry about so called ""next-gen"" consoles causing the average game budget to skyrocket?

												Very fun game, worth whatever you can catch it on sale for! Nice graphics and awesome retro-shooter styled gameplay. Framerate is all over the place. Going from 30 to 60 isn't really uncommon throughout the game. Uncommon would be maintaining a consistent framerate, but if you set the graphics options correctly, you won't notice anything, other than the already pretty obvious blood and gore. Nothing really sets the game back other than it's 40€ normal price tag, and the lack of versus servers with a decent ping, though the latter isn't much of an issue because the game is made more for co-op anyway. Overall, much like the predecessors, there isn't much that can top Serious Sam 3 for balls to the wall shooting fun out there, so if you want to play a game with a bunch of friends and don't wanna think to much, this is a great option right here.Also,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....

												Ну, я ждал эту игру 6 лет и вот что разработчики преподнесли.Хотелось бы начать с графики. Её как я и ожидал улучшили, но одно меня огорчило. Движок Serious Engine 3.5 абсолютно кривой и его кривизна заметна. На моменте когда Сэм вырывает глаз гнаару хочется плакать, вид от 3го лица вообще лучше не включать. Если уж делать игру с кооперативом, то надо ж его до ума довести. Смотреть как твой партнёр держит оружие ладошками просто смешно и на то как Сэм передвигается сидя без слёз не взглянешь. Ну если откинуть движок и все его недочёты, то игра получилась очень крутой хоть непродолжительной, всего около 3-6 часов. Разработчикам удалось сохранить ту атмосферу которая была в предыдущих двух частях, когда на тебя бежит толпа разгневанных пришельцев и тебе ничего не остаётся, кроме того чтобы взять миниган и всех их похоронить.Саунтрэк просто сногшибательный, куча новых врагов, куча нового оружия, кооператив на 16 человек, все теже коронные фразочки Сэма, всё это подарило незабываемое удовольствие от игры.Конечно же игра не стоит своих 600 рублей, но на распрадаже по скидкам взять и поиграть с друзьями просто необходимо! Вобщем оценка моя такова 9.7 было бы 10 если бы движок доработали,а так игра крутая всем советую.			",62,3,1,2,2,2,1

												Another late review - I prefer the older Serious Sam games, but that may just be out of nostalgia. This game isn't bad though. In fact, it is far from that in my opinion. It stays true to the Serious Sam series and doesn't alter the main gameplay mechanics. Only things new are the option to reload and the addition of melee attacks, both of which I am cool with. Very difficult though, even on its Tourist difficulty. I recommend it if you're a diehard Serious Sam fan, otherwise you may find it kinda meh. But that's just my own assumption.

												A fun lighthearted game. Reminded me of the old DukeNukem style of game. I was stuck in the first mission thinking if I killed everything they would stop coming and that I would just walk to the objective. Wrong! I am in two minds whether this is a good or bad thing as you get rated at the end of the mission how many kills, how many secrets and how long you take. Well you can keep killing guys and take forever and get a crap score or you can run to the objective not worrying to much about the aliens and get a decent score. Not quite balance in that regard. An ejoyable game. If you can grab for under $5 its a great deal.6.5/10 ",122,15,3,22,5,0,11

												I really have to stress, this game has a few important things going for it:A) It's not an early access game, it's finished and polished by a dev who knew what they were doing and have done it enough times to perfect the art.B) There are no zombies. Lots of monsters, but half of those monsters have guns and use tactics!C) It's fast paced and fun, it doesn't take itself too seriously, it's entertaining!D) It has a fun co-op campaign with a story!E) Pretty decent looking visuals!There are not a lot of games on Steam which can boast having those 5 points.

												Great old school shooter with running gun ablazing. Trade the subtlety of modern FPSs with pure adrenaline rush. No cover, no health recovery, no taking sissy break every 30 seconds. Beautiful graphics and intense sound design make you feel manly and powerful. Some dry sense of humor that some might find offensive.Overall good to pick up and play once a while for pure silly fun.			",172,19,9,24,18,0,50

												Very fun game, worth whatever you can catch it on sale for! Nice graphics and awesome retro-shooter styled gameplay. Framerate is all over the place. Going from 30 to 60 isn't really uncommon throughout the game. Uncommon would be maintaining a consistent framerate, but if you set the graphics options correctly, you won't notice anything, other than the already pretty obvious blood and gore. Nothing really sets the game back other than it's 40€ normal price tag, and the lack of versus servers with a decent ping, though the latter isn't much of an issue because the game is made more for co-op anyway. Overall, much like the predecessors, there isn't much that can top Serious Sam 3 for balls to the wall shooting fun out there, so if you want to play a game with a bunch of friends and don't wanna think to much, this is a great option right here.Also,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....

												Stupid. Testosterone-filled. Pointless. Crude.These are a few words that come to mind when I played Duke Nukem, I mean Serious Sam. The humor is low-brow, the action is arcad-ie and relentless, and the protagonist’s voice, dear God. Everyone in this game has a voice actor but he has a lawn mower. This game feels like it was deliberately terrible and I think that is what makes it enjoyable. Once again, playing with friends is the only way, this time you can have 15 of ‘em with you! I do enjoy playing this game due to its instantly gratifying nature and lack of actual investment.6/10			",225,51,0,29,25,2,28

												Another late review - I prefer the older Serious Sam games, but that may just be out of nostalgia. This game isn't bad though. In fact, it is far from that in my opinion. It stays true to the Serious Sam series and doesn't alter the main gameplay mechanics. Only things new are the option to reload and the addition of melee attacks, both of which I am cool with. Very difficult though, even on its Tourist difficulty. I recommend it if you're a diehard Serious Sam fan, otherwise you may find it kinda meh. But that's just my own assumption.

												another robust, tightly-bound,♥♥♥♥♥♥fantasy sliding down into the easy to overcome guy vs tons of girls action genre, complete with a ""gonzo"" first-person pov camera.the strong male lead role, a rarity in this industry, is a breath of fresh air from all of the music that objectifies men i hear my coworkers listening to on the radio. however, there is more work to be done: the male character is muscular, hard working, and cool looking while doing it -- your typical booth babe.his dialogue is full of innuendos, too. it distracts serious gamers (yes, we exist :P ). but it's ignorable. we've sort of learned to just tune it out anyway.this game does make some strides for equality, though. there was one scene where sam stumbles into a dark alley and you just _know_ what follows. however, they avoided this trope. it's as if the ladies behind the game wanted to tell us ""hey, men are people too."" unfortunately, they couldn't keep a straight face long enough as the next scene had sam panting his way out of a sweaty scuffle, whereby he loses his shirt somehow. yeah. . . two step forward, three steps back.oh, btw, despite claims made by the devs during E3, this game does NOT pass the wallace/bechdel test.

												Serious Sam 3 is an utterly ridiculous, stupid game that revels in its own ridiculous stupidity. The main character is a lunkhead. The enemies are absurd. Everything that happens is beyond the realm of anything that could be considered ""art."" But does that make it a bad game? No. Not by a long shot. It's actually one of the most riotously funny good times you can have on Steam. Beyond the humor and sort of ironic affability of the main character, the core gameplay is tough as nails but rewarding. All of the mechanics work almost perfectly, making the only thing contributing to your constant deaths your own incompetence. It's a fast, fun, furious kind of experience, and definitely something that you'll get a lot of mileage out of. (For my full reviews and gaming news, check out digitaldevils.net) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Serving as a prequel to the original indie sensation, Serious Sam: The First Encounter, Serious Sam 3: BFE takes place during the Earth's final struggle against Mental's invading legions of beasts and mercenaries.The story, as it were, is pretty thin. It's the future. Mankind has gone off into space. Evil aliens are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. Earth has been invaded. Humans are screwed. Sam is humanity's last hope. He doesn't give a damn, he's good with a gun, and high explosives are the perfect solution to most of his problems. Most of the dialogue is corny with a side helping of heavy cheese, but there are a few laughs sprinkled throughout. The game isn't afraid to poke fun at genre conventions, and Sam is more or less a self-aggrandizing caricature of the ""buff dumb hero"" stereotype.Most of the enemies are familiar, with headless kamikaze troopers, laser-spewing Biomechanoids and vicious Kleer skeletons returning with their familiar attacks in place. Every enemy has been redesigned to make them look more detestable and even disturbing than ever.Serious Sam 3: BFE is not a game for the faint of heart. It will challenge your resolve while it constantly pushes you back under a tidal wave of skeletons, fireballs, rockets and chaingun-wielding scorpions. Its levels can last up to an hour, its gameplay never deviates from one note, and it will cause players to thump their desks and roar with rage, but it's so much fun.			",84,20,3,15,18,0,21

												Serious Sam 3 takes the classic fast paced action and frantic gun selection of the early 90s and adds some nice spice from newer mechanics introduced in the modern day FPS genre.Often I found myself wrecklessly attacking my foes as death lingered just around the corner. Vast and expansive areas filled with hundreds of enemies swarming at me. Serious Sam is not only a tight shooter, but one that has some of the most impressive battles.What makes Serious Sam really work is the ability to truly fine tune your experience. You can make co-op a rather enjoyable and hiliarious shooter, or you can make it competitive and difficult, the choice is yours.Dying WILL happen. This game can be out right sinister with the tricks and situations it puts you in, and only your skills and smart thinking will get you through.However as great fun as that all is, what brings the game down is really itself. I found that often times killing enemies can get REALLY tedious and breaks are something of a must when looking to complete the game.Single player is also dull without anyone to experience the ridiculous traps and cheesy jokes and B movie dialogue.Multiplayer (Not Co-op) just feels a bit tacked on and really doesn't encompass what makes Sam, well, Sam. It can be fun for an hour or so, but I would really only play it to duke it out with some friends on a rare occasion.Also, the last level is absolutely BRUTAL, and I can't imagine doing it without infinite lives and a partner. Definitely my most fond memory of the game.Liked: - Fast- Action packed- Co-op galore Disliked:- RepetitiveOverall, what Sam 3 does is fun. It might not be perfect and often times dull, but when you get the chance for this game to shine it can really blow you away. One of my favorite Co-op games, and something I would recommend to anyone that has just a close friend, or even up to 16 cool dudes. 7/10			",405,53,8,29,20,3,45

												Very fun game, worth whatever you can catch it on sale for! Nice graphics and awesome retro-shooter styled gameplay. Framerate is all over the place. Going from 30 to 60 isn't really uncommon throughout the game. Uncommon would be maintaining a consistent framerate, but if you set the graphics options correctly, you won't notice anything, other than the already pretty obvious blood and gore. Nothing really sets the game back other than it's 40€ normal price tag, and the lack of versus servers with a decent ping, though the latter isn't much of an issue because the game is made more for co-op anyway. Overall, much like the predecessors, there isn't much that can top Serious Sam 3 for balls to the wall shooting fun out there, so if you want to play a game with a bunch of friends and don't wanna think to much, this is a great option right here.Also,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....

												Serious Sam 3 is an utterly ridiculous, stupid game that revels in its own ridiculous stupidity. The main character is a lunkhead. The enemies are absurd. Everything that happens is beyond the realm of anything that could be considered ""art."" But does that make it a bad game? No. Not by a long shot. It's actually one of the most riotously funny good times you can have on Steam. Beyond the humor and sort of ironic affability of the main character, the core gameplay is tough as nails but rewarding. All of the mechanics work almost perfectly, making the only thing contributing to your constant deaths your own incompetence. It's a fast, fun, furious kind of experience, and definitely something that you'll get a lot of mileage out of. (For my full reviews and gaming news, check out digitaldevils.net) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stupid. Testosterone-filled. Pointless. Crude.These are a few words that come to mind when I played Duke Nukem, I mean Serious Sam. The humor is low-brow, the action is arcad-ie and relentless, and the protagonist’s voice, dear God. Everyone in this game has a voice actor but he has a lawn mower. This game feels like it was deliberately terrible and I think that is what makes it enjoyable. Once again, playing with friends is the only way, this time you can have 15 of ‘em with you! I do enjoy playing this game due to its instantly gratifying nature and lack of actual investment.6/10			",225,51,0,29,25,2,28

												Totally following the steps of the very first Serious Sam game.Same environment, story, character design and seriousness (not that its nto funny enough, but i gotta admit that i laughed a LOT with Serious Sam 2).Which makes me think that this must be a reboot of the series (haven't read any articles about it, so im guessing this is indeed a reboot).Fun. Splatter. Old school FPS.Million times better than Duke Nukem i tell you that.a good game for old timers and hardcore Seriou Sam fanstime to get serious~			",168,14,7,16,7,0,7

												another robust, tightly-bound,♥♥♥♥♥♥fantasy sliding down into the easy to overcome guy vs tons of girls action genre, complete with a ""gonzo"" first-person pov camera.the strong male lead role, a rarity in this industry, is a breath of fresh air from all of the music that objectifies men i hear my coworkers listening to on the radio. however, there is more work to be done: the male character is muscular, hard working, and cool looking while doing it -- your typical booth babe.his dialogue is full of innuendos, too. it distracts serious gamers (yes, we exist :P ). but it's ignorable. we've sort of learned to just tune it out anyway.this game does make some strides for equality, though. there was one scene where sam stumbles into a dark alley and you just _know_ what follows. however, they avoided this trope. it's as if the ladies behind the game wanted to tell us ""hey, men are people too."" unfortunately, they couldn't keep a straight face long enough as the next scene had sam panting his way out of a sweaty scuffle, whereby he loses his shirt somehow. yeah. . . two step forward, three steps back.oh, btw, despite claims made by the devs during E3, this game does NOT pass the wallace/bechdel test.

												Serious Sam 3 takes the classic fast paced action and frantic gun selection of the early 90s and adds some nice spice from newer mechanics introduced in the modern day FPS genre.Often I found myself wrecklessly attacking my foes as death lingered just around the corner. Vast and expansive areas filled with hundreds of enemies swarming at me. Serious Sam is not only a tight shooter, but one that has some of the most impressive battles.What makes Serious Sam really work is the ability to truly fine tune your experience. You can make co-op a rather enjoyable and hiliarious shooter, or you can make it competitive and difficult, the choice is yours.Dying WILL happen. This game can be out right sinister with the tricks and situations it puts you in, and only your skills and smart thinking will get you through.However as great fun as that all is, what brings the game down is really itself. I found that often times killing enemies can get REALLY tedious and breaks are something of a must when looking to complete the game.Single player is also dull without anyone to experience the ridiculous traps and cheesy jokes and B movie dialogue.Multiplayer (Not Co-op) just feels a bit tacked on and really doesn't encompass what makes Sam, well, Sam. It can be fun for an hour or so, but I would really only play it to duke it out with some friends on a rare occasion.Also, the last level is absolutely BRUTAL, and I can't imagine doing it without infinite lives and a partner. Definitely my most fond memory of the game.Liked: - Fast- Action packed- Co-op galore Disliked:- RepetitiveOverall, what Sam 3 does is fun. It might not be perfect and often times dull, but when you get the chance for this game to shine it can really blow you away. One of my favorite Co-op games, and something I would recommend to anyone that has just a close friend, or even up to 16 cool dudes. 7/10			",405,53,8,29,20,3,45

												So many great homages to classic First Person Shooters have come out recently, with Shadow Warrior, Hard Reset, Wolfenstein: The New Order, Rise of The Triad etc... So, what makes Serious Sam 3 stand out from the rest? Well, here are a few reasons: This game is perfect for playing with a friend. The whole game of Serious Sam revolves around you plaing in huge, open-ended enviornments, mowing down wave after wave of literally hundreds of enemies. Playing by yourself is intense, challenging, and down-right panic enducing. With a friend, the intensity is doubled, and the fun factor just shoots through the roof. Trying to separate the waves of enemies into two different targets is really challenging, and it feels even more satisfying when you've got a buddy. The game's also down-right hilarious. The developers and writers knew what kind of game they were making, and they don't take themselves seriously at all. The game rags on itself, common action movie tropes, practically anything related to action movies in general. The weapons are just straight-up badass. They even have a double-barreled shotgun (DooM's famous ""Super Shotgun"") that feels just like the classic iteration. Some of the weapons are down-right wacky - like the canonball launcher, which literally flattens hundreds of enemies at a time. The gunplay feels solid, and you feel like you can dole out some serious damage-- a thing that's lacking from a lot of modern-day FPS. The amount of customization in the PC version is stellar, too. You can honestly get lost in the graphics settings menu. Seriously, more PC games need to take a hint from Croteam and allow this lush, rich level of customization options.I love classic First Person Shooters quite a bit, and I guess that's why I'm even more happy with this product. I'll be putting tons of hours into it before DooM comes out. I also highly recommend you check out the other games listed at the top of my review, but pick this one up first and go blow up some monsters.  ",179,20,3,11,12,0,22

												Let me preface this by saying only one thing: If you are used to easy games, then stay very far away. VERY far away. With that being said...Serious Sam 3: BFE is set a little bit before the original in the series, and has some different mechanics from the pure run'n gun originals that preceed it. Tweaks such as a dedicated sprint button, and *gasp* reloading. But the core mechanics are still the same as they always were: Kill anything that moves. The story of the game is quite a bit below average, aping the Call of Duty series thinly in the cutscenes with a touch of ""serious"" humor to go along with it, but for the most part, it can be ignored almost entirely, as it doesn't really add much to the overall mythos of the series. Wait.. did I just seriously say that? Though I will admit that the cutscenes involoving the reveal of bosses and such are extremely well done, and of course, the voice acting is... ""serious.""Graphics of the game are a treat to behold in all their glory, especially on decent systems, and despite the sheer number of enemies you face at one time, there isn't usually much slowdown to be had here. The art style has shifted to a more realistic approach, unlike earlier games in the series, which used a somewhat toned down cartoony approach to the visuals. Not an unpleasant look overall, but it might infuriate the fans of the older games.At the heart of it all, it's a run-n-gun shooter, much in the line of the legendary Quake and Doom, only amped up to the 'nth degree with literally thousands of enemies to shoot. Thanks to that, the game becomes brutally difficult, mainly due to the sheer numbers of enemies that you have to deal with at any one time. I've seen as many as 100 enemies coming at me at the same time. Are the enemies intelligent? No, thankfully. Because if they were, it would be truly impossible to beat them. Instead, they run straight for you, for the most part. Granted, there are some that have a bit of variety in their attack patterns, forcing you to shift your strategy mid-battle on a regular basis, but overall, they just have one thing to do: kill you. However, due to the variety of enemies, and the differing requirements to kill them, it NEVER gets boring. This is one of those games that every weapon is good for something, even the lowly sledgehammer gets some use, even in late game. Learning what works best for each situation becomes a part of your strategy, as each weapon has unique qualities and uses.Is this game ""serious"" enough to stand on the giants shoulders of the genre? Close. The brutal difficulty is the main thing that stands in the way of it being considered, in my opinion, the best of the series. One other thing...it has a serious sense of humor. Seriously.

												Here's a very honest review:The game starts out with a massive wow! The guns are awesome, the humour is amazing, the boss battles are satisfying, the level design is old school. What more could you possibly want? Sadly, the game has its downfalls, as follows:~Gameplay becomes very repetitive after about 6 missions, and I found myself cheating through the last few.~The game is slightly unoptimized and frame drops are imminent.~No one online so expect only singleplayer, unless you've got buddies to play withI can't seem to get enough of the oldschool level design vibe where you find yourself running around the whole level, trying to find the exit. Sadly, the terrain gets repetitive since 90% of the missions are outside in large open spaces.Verdict:It's not worth $39.99, so pick it up if it's on sale, and if you like unrealistic old school shooters of course.Did you know?Serious Sam 3: BFE was made on the same engine as The Talos Principle?

												Gameplay is frickin addictive and the guns are fun. It is the best Serious Sam game in my opinion. The only downside to this game is probably the reload mechanci which some people may not like, but I don't mind it. The sprint mechanic works perfectly for this type of game, though it looks weird and not ""AAA"" like, if that makes sense. You can ""stutter sprint"" in this game, and that's a mechanic you will have to use at ""hard"" or higher difficulties to get through the game. Game overall looks weird as it tries to put on a realistic setting and perhaps that is its primary drawback, but mechanically the game improves on the previous Sam games as a sequel should. Great game and a must own. A lot of challenge and fun to be had here.			",303,35,8,21,11,1,22

												This game is a great example of how I like my games, intense and great.It's not as great as the previous Serious Sam In my opinion but it gets the job done for a modern game unlike most of nowadays video games such as Call of Duty.Enemies running after you non stop at highest difficulty, what can you ask more? I'd ask better maps, they're not bad but they don't have the feel of Serious Sam nor Serious Sam 2.The game is really good,  I must admit that at first, I was unsure about this game, I would probably have gave it a 6/10 but now I know that it deserves much more than that so that's why I finally decided to give this game a review.If you like fast paced shooter where horde of enemies will attack you then you will like this game.8/10			",972,203,71,193,128,3,223

												Dispite the fact that I played the original serious sam as a child, i was hooked. the gore, the monster pounding AWESOMENESS was just amazing! and now, from one of my favorite developers, comes one of the best (also underrated) game ever. Tons of gore, tons of weapons, tons of monsters. what more do you want? with crushing difficulty, serious sam makes its revival after it's infamous serious sam 2 (which wasn't good.) Serious sam 4 is coming sooner or later, the only problem i have with this game is the amount of rendering it needs. It's too much for nearly everyone. I still play it on roughly 60 fps after lowering some options, kind of a shame that i can't see the game's true bloodyness.			",62,7,3,4,3,1,10

If you like big guns and things that bleed then here you go. Shot, smack, Rip, and Blow things up as you play this game alone or with friends. WIth hordes of enemies and lots of secrets top find in ever level what more do you want. The Graphics look awesome and easy to run for computers not so top tier. Then you have mods that just furthers the enjoyment of the game.10/10-Will Still Be Killing More.			",41,2,0,3,1,0,0

												Probably one of the best Serious Sam games in the series in my opinion. The sprint option in the game is great for dodging those kamikazes and kleers left and right. The melee option now makes the game even more gory than it used to be. Aim down sights is kind of cool, but somewhat useless since it just slows you down and only increases accuracy by a small percentage. It would be nice if the lasergun wasn't an easter egg and was an actual gun that was meant to be used ingame. Same thing with the sniper. Two of my favorite weapons from the old games aside from the minigun and cannon. Another note, this is possibly one of the only Serious Sam games without the serious bomb to nuke enemies, but the game makes up for it with the new features to help you with escaping and retreating to ammo and armor. All in all, my favorite game in the series and can't wait for the next installment where we get to possibly see Mental's ugly face.			",17,0,1,2,1,0,0

												Gameplay is frickin addictive and the guns are fun. It is the best Serious Sam game in my opinion. The only downside to this game is probably the reload mechanci which some people may not like, but I don't mind it. The sprint mechanic works perfectly for this type of game, though it looks weird and not ""AAA"" like, if that makes sense. You can ""stutter sprint"" in this game, and that's a mechanic you will have to use at ""hard"" or higher difficulties to get through the game. Game overall looks weird as it tries to put on a realistic setting and perhaps that is its primary drawback, but mechanically the game improves on the previous Sam games as a sequel should. Great game and a must own. A lot of challenge and fun to be had here.			",303,35,8,21,11,1,22

Posted: November 17, 2013
												I've always been fond of fast pace shooters but I haven't really played any in the last 5 or 8 years. This game brought back my love for them in new astounding ways.This game isn't something you buy for a story. The story is there all the way to the end but it's truly there to pave the way to killing thousands of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ alien monsters. Although I did enjoy the story but this is not a game to get if you want to delve into a deep story.The graphics were the first thing that spoke to me. It has serious character and is beautiful when you crank the settings out to maximum serious pwnage. You can tell it's a PC dominant game just by how many graphical settings you can tweak in-game. I absolutely love this aspect of the game. Here's where the juicy part comes in. The gameplay. This is by far the most fun I've experienced in a video game in years as far as gameplay is concerned. From the very intro I fell in love with the mechanics of ripping monsters to nothingness in a pile of red blood splattering everywhere to your screen and surroundings. Plenty of guns and plenty of serious ways to decimate your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly enemy. There's plenty of enemy variety that you will encounter in Serious Sam 3 and I love em' all (except the skeletal things). Buy this game for the gameplay cause it's rememberable and the most fun you can experience in fast paced shoot em' up while running gameplay. It's nonstop fun really. The best part about it is how much blood and gore flashes around while you kill the enemies in different ways. I was looking for a game with great blood effects and this game is top notch in that regard.The sounds in the game were also great. All the weapons and guns had their own unique tune and were a great part of the atmosphere. The music itself was good and fit the egyptian setting quite well. The best part of the music though is definitely the heavy metal music they incorporate during certain sequences. There's not much like entering a magnificent boss battle and starting with hard rocking music to give you a rush of adrenaline. You don't even need music to get an adrenaline rush in this game but it definitely succeeds in amplifying it.The map design is something I definitely enjoyed. All the levels were unique to themselves and offered much to love. The start of the game is much smaller and linear though. After you pass the first few levels though the game begins to open up massively giving you giant environments to fight. So if you don't like small maps don't fret, the game opens up to serious levels only a few levels in. Personally I liked the smaller sections as much as I liked the large ones. As far as the bad things about the game I can't say too much on that regard. The animations at times are a bit lacking but I hardly notice it when I have a rush of Kamikazi's running towards me ready to explode on impact. During cutscenes the lip animation also lacks but honestly it's not something I cared about cause I loved the overly cliche dialogue. Simply put this is a very special game for me that I had a total blast to finish. Everything from Serious Sam's one liners, graphics, gameplay, and music were absolutely perfect. Do yourself a favor and buy it cause on sale it's fairly cheap.			",89,6,0,14,4,1,3

												Serious Same 3: BFE takes everything you love about the original Serious Sam and adds some modern touches to the formula. I really like the pacing of this game. In the first Serious Sam, they throw a ton of weapons at you in a short period of time. Usually, you go in order from the best weapon to the worst in terms of power while fighting enemies until you run out of ammo. In SS3:BFE, they give you a weapon and you don't pick up another one for a longer time period, which means you understand the use of each weapon as you go through the game. Each weapon seems to have better uses for different situations. As always, the multiplayer is top notch and really fun with more players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Serious Sam has always had an arcade spin on it and this mode grabs that notion by the balls by impaling them on byros and flashing them at school kidsIt's good that croteam backed off on what they scared customers away with during ss2, but they've got a bit of recoil to deal with.

												If you want a classic thowback to the good old days of old first person shooters in the form of better graphics then this is definitely for you. The Serious Sam series has been widely known to feature large and explorable areas filled with secrets and possibly easter eggs unlike most other shooters out there.Singleplayer:Story is honestly a bit crap and boring but this is outweighed by the fantastic gameplay. Tons of difficulty levels to test your skill. Tons of awesome and badass sountracks to listen to while you're killing hordes of enemies. Good level design at parts and very detailed and believable atmosphere and enivroment. Cool enemies with strengths and weaknesses. Overall singleplayer is pretty good.Multiplayer:Awesome, It's much more fun to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up with your friends than singleplayer. Play Co-Op through the singleplayer campaign. Or make the last stand in Survival trying to beat your highscore. Only problem with multiplayer is that theres not many servers anymore since this game was made a while ago :(. I've played countless hours with friends and what not in a very fun multiplayer mode.Modable Version:Very fun to see what people have come up with on the workshop. Only downside is that you can't play with other people unless they have the same mod(s) as you do.This game also can be poorly designed at certain parts. Some places where you were not meant to go can actually be found by exploiting the partially broken sandwhale mapping and the small edges that can be stood upon and jumped from and to another platform. The last level in my opinion was very very tedious, I'm sure you see what I mean if you have played this before. The final boss is a little dissapointing in my honesty and hoped it would be a little harder.8.6/10 highly reccomended for all you FPS fans out there, not the best game...but can be a fun classic, especially with friends.

												Starts out really dull, like a cheap COD knock-off. Even quit playing it. Then I read some reviews claiming it's supposed to get better after the first few levels, and it does! Minigun, Pyramids, Hordes of enemys... Really brings back that First and Second Encouter Gameplay. Except the Space Monkeys. F**k the Space Monkeys.			",105,43,1,0,1,2,4

The best targets for C4 are as follows: Khnums, scrapjacks, witch-brides, major biomechanoids.4. firing off a few rockets and switching to the minigun or assault rifle is a surprisingly  good strategy.5. above all costs, shoot kamikazes first, you'll live to shoot that scrapjack trying to  reduce you to giblets.6.

												Serious Sam in all his glory. The story is decent, the graphics are pretty awesome but more importantly the gameplay is fun. Hordes upon hordes of crazier than crazy enemies running right at you in an attempt to do the impossible: kill Serious Sam. The game is fairly difficult on the default setting, making it a nice challenge. Just get through the first few levels and you'll start seeing the old school shooter that this game really is. The only issue I could mention is the length and perhaps the pacing. The single player campaign takes about 10-12 hours - and the first few hours are very slow, compared to the rest. Playing through the game on different difficulties could make it last longer and there is a survival mode, not to mention multiplayer. It's a solid game altogether, especially if you're a fan of the series. Last but not least...It's time to get serious!			",165,19,0,16,4,3,16

												This looked to be a step in the right direction after SS2 lost its way, but sadly SS3 has not learnt from many of those mistakes. The levels are still mostly made up of corridors and enclosed spaces instead of the glorious open spaces the first two encounters are known for, and SS3 even has you spend a lot of time in the dark with only a flashlight to see.. This isn't very Serious at all. The flying/jumping enemies are also as annoying as ever.Overall it's okay and better than SS2 but not a patch on the Encounters or their HD remakes, which is a shame.			",142,44,10,12,11,2,21

There's points where you're faced with alien onslaughts and it's crazy trying to maneuver around their different techniques, and it's complete chaos along with a pretty interesting story line/objective campaign.And you also get a rocket launcher.. I mean... Do you really need any more information?Rocket. Launcher.			",69,2,0,10,8,0,3

												A fun, medium length romp through the deserts of Egypt as lacking in plot as it is in facial animations. This is made up for and then some by the sheer unbridled awesomeness of its combat. Huge hordes of enemies on even bigger maps with an even larger arsenal to shred everything that stands in your path. My only real major gripe is the final level, exluding the (suitably awesome, though initially confusing) final boss. While it had its own inhumanly large hordes of enemies, most of the level took place in a shadowy canyon. Tacking on a washed-out color filter and you get hordes that are 85% silhouettes, which is a surprisngly off putting, have spent the entire rest of the game watching your enemies explode into meaty chunks amidst a cloud of red mist. To top it all off, the game, for me at least, lagged heavily throughout most of the final level.Having said that, Serious Sam 3: BFE is still a good game and the only one in my library to rival the Saints Row series for stupid, over-the-top, but ultimately satisfying fun.

Cons: - Every map has the same style: Egypt, sand, sand, and sand. Oh and a pyramid and a house.. on sand. There are a few moments where it takes a break from sand listed in the pros.- Most enemies are tough and tedious, and at times ridiculous. Half of the game (exaggeration) is struggling to survive against hordes of skeletons leaping at you while you move in circles shooting a shotgun round every 2 seconds.- Obnoxious sound from the ""AHHHHHHH"" enemies. It was fun for the first few minutes but, I don't even want to think about it.- The beginning of the game is very slow paced. Pros: - Has scary environments (mostly inside the dark tombs) and in some levels I was jumping in my chair from some un-intended jump scares. - Has breathtaking moments. There are about 2 parts of the game where you aren't in sand, instead you were in a   futuristic area  and that's probably why they were so breathtaking. But those 2 moments didn't last very long, sadly.- Trying to figure out how to counter the enemies. All attacks from enemies are dodge-able. What weapon should I use on that enemy? What do I do to counter that enemy's attacks? Should I run or can I fight it? Etc.- Enemy and weapon diversity, some enemies have cool abilities and you have a big arsenal to choose from.- Mostly destroy-able maps. Large scale battles and boss fights are a lot cooler when trees and walls are being blasted down. - The Storyline. Even though it was cheesy, it was still classic and didn't downgrade the game. - Special effects. People complain about the sand flying into the air upon being shot or blown up and being unable to see, but that adds to the realism and horror factor.- Alien FX Support. Keyboard is green at high HP, and it flashes red when taking damage. Medium HP it's yellow and low HP it's red.  So if you don't like challenging games that will make you angry at times, this isn't for you.  ",71,7,1,2,7,0,5

												Serious Sam afficionados would expect from a Serious Sam game to be about big open arenas with hundred of enemies spawning in it and a lot of big weapons to counter that. After all, the tutorial of Serious sam 1 had more than 500 enemies in it.Well, for the first 4 levels, this game doesn't deliver that. Instead, we're in cluttered city, with small weapons, and very few enemies (about 150-200 per level). It seems like the developpers wanted to introduce the world of Serious Sam slowly for people who are more used to modern games such as Call of Duty. It does deliver some hard fights because you don't have many weapons, but it's not that fun after a whileHowever, if you manage to get over that first phase, you will finally get your rocket launcher at the end of level 4, and your first big arena at the end of level 5. And then, you will finally get the Serious Sam game you were looking for. The big arenas are back, with tons of ammo (sometimes even boxes of infinite ammo) for you to be able to use the biggest and most badass weapons without a second thought. Waves of enemies will come, and you will mercilessly mow them down.More over, that second part of the game is cleverly designed. Instead of just being endless slaughter after endless slaughter, the game manages to provide some variety. For example, it will often alternate between the big open arenas where you can be as badass as you want, and some underground, claustrophobic corridors, where the limited vision offered by your flashlight will make you a prey. There are also others set pieces that I will not spoil for you. Suffice to say that once the game finally start rolling, it's hard to put down, it does a lot of stuff very well, up to the final level, which is utterly insane, and a great conclusion to the game.On the technical side, the Serious Sam 3 engine is extremely impressive, it manages to have dozens of enemies on the screen at the time, while looking gorgeous, and also have destructible terrain. If you or one of the enemy uses rockets, or C4, you will be able to blow up almost any obstacle, for example to remove the cover of an enemy, or to help give you a better line of sight on far away enemies. Finally, I want to give a mentions to the soundtrack which is fantastic, and accompagnies the game extremely well. Big thumbs up for that.So my final word is easy : buy this game, get over the first four levels even if you're not that happy with them, and you will be rewarded by a great game of utter mayhem and joyous use of rocket launcher.

												Croteam has done it again!PROS--Smooth as hell gameplay-Huge Multiplayer-Original components as well as new additions to game mechanics-Great story-WorkshopCONS--Terrible cutscenes-Unecessary charactersOVERVIEW-This game has almost everything right. Gameplay is fluid and fresh and originates to the old mechanics perfectly. Multiplayer still goes big and bold, with Story Co-Op, Deathmatch and the new Survival mode. Workshop compatability allows for mods and maps, which give the game endless hours of fun, besides the fact that people hardly ever release maps or mods. My only problems relate to the story. Don't get me wrong, the story is freakin awesome and keeps a lot of the same elements from the classics. Only problem I have is the cutscenes and characters. Every time the characters show up, they either die after that cutscene or you only get to see them in another cutscene, that you're not involved in, where they die. Every character just arrives to die. It's pointless and doesn't enrich the story in any way. Besides these cons, the game itself is amazingly fun and has a pretty damn high replay value. 420/360 would smoke again			",125,9,1,9,6,1,0

Pros:- Oldschool   - Tough   - Opposite of modern military shooter   - Secret weapons/ect- Such Graphics!   - Justifies GPU purchaces   - Multi-core CPU usage   - PC port of legends.

Здоровье востанавливаеться только в аптечках, оружие с собой можно брать столько, что грузовик не загрузишь... вам придёться уворачиваться от 50 ракет сразу, при этом на вас будут пытаться забодать огромные быки штук 10, а на заднем фоне вы услышите АААААААА!!! Нет это не враги кричат убегаю от вас... Расслабились? хрен вам это камикадзе штук 60 и чем ближе кричат тем хуже для вас...

												SERIOUS PROBLEMS: movement in the newest serious engine feels like role-playing diarrhearocket launcher made redundantlacks previous games' level design charm, realistic enemies are cool, realistic worlds can be quite the snoreseriously obnoxious swearingPOSITIVE CHANGES:more lore and closure without hurting future titles' potentialsprinting + iron sights = immersion + blissnew iconic ""melee"" weapons and ""finishers""someone at croteam picked up on the best song in the series and made sure everyone who tried out the survival mode knew about it toodid i mention the survival mode? difficult but oh so rewarding. Serious Sam has always had an arcade spin on it and this mode grabs that notion by the balls by impaling them on byros and flashing them at school kidsIt's good that croteam backed off on what they scared customers away with during ss2, but they've got a bit of recoil to deal with. I have to reccomend Serious Sam : The Second Encounter HD before anything else as of 2015.			",81,11,1,13,2,1,4

												Serious Same 3: BFE takes everything you love about the original Serious Sam and adds some modern touches to the formula. I really like the pacing of this game. In the first Serious Sam, they throw a ton of weapons at you in a short period of time. Usually, you go in order from the best weapon to the worst in terms of power while fighting enemies until you run out of ammo. In SS3:BFE, they give you a weapon and you don't pick up another one for a longer time period, which means you understand the use of each weapon as you go through the game. Each weapon seems to have better uses for different situations. As always, the multiplayer is top notch and really fun with more players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most of the things they've introduced anew are kind of bad, like weapon reloading, and sprinting while unable to use your weapon, rather than Sam just running that fast all the time. Melee kills are kind of neat once, but you just don't have time for them by the point the game has ramped up to a proper Serious level.It doesn't matter. It's still Sam. Soon the trappings of more modern shooters fall away and leave you with the familiar old tools, weaving your way through a herd of Kleer while trying to deal with the approaching gigantic horror before it steps on you. It doesn't really progress the series in any way but graphically (the plot has gone backwards again), but it can get away with being another iteration of the solid fast-and-fluid FPS and leave you grinning from the adrenaline.

												This game continues what the previous Serious Sam games (First Encounter, Second Encounter) had while improving the graphics and gameplay. Like the previous ones, you fight what seems like an endless stream of monsters. There seems to be more a bit more story and characters than the two predecessors. Serious Sam 3: BFE did what Duke Nukem Forever couldn't, deliver a enjoyable FPS experience and fun.			",415,121,4,30,25,4,56

												Inspired by Call of Duty mechanics and realism, nothing beats closed-in, linear maps like Serious Sam(e) 3! Not only does SS3 brings nothing new to the table (besides it's Call of Duty inspiration), but you can finally be held back by constant reloading during your epic battles against enormous hordes of enemies!

												Coming from my FAVORITE videogame series of all time! Serious Sam 3: BFE shows me a different perspective of how this was all started. The mechanics are fairly the same as for the others in the official series campaign (excluding the indie games) just run, gun, blow up, and basically 'shoot everything that moves!' Along with the (not entirely rspected) modernized mechanics for sprinting, which is extremely helpful in some cases of survivalbility. Aiming sights, which is kind of dumb having to do that because the original games had their guns automatically pinpoint accurate. And the melee which is a nice touch for me, giving more killing varieties. The levels for this game are MASSIVE and have secrets scattered about everywhere, but I am not going to complain how people think the level designs are 'linear.' Just to note that the classic games had linearity of their own perspective, but not big. The music ambience is really soothing, battle music fits my tastes, and boss music gives a big sense of adrenaline for me. The artstyle for me is decent, I do enjoy its 'semi-realism' approach; but I go for the classic's artstyle which had more cartoonish aspects to it. The weapons are still as devastating as ever. The enemy count is HUGE and there are some new variety of enemies now, though not much more, but some. The DLC (Jewel of the Nile) topped the icing, bringing what fans more wanted.My overall verdict: Buy it!			",68,2,0,6,5,2,1

												Thumbs Up Recommend! Why? It's Serious Sam 3 for Pete's sake! Come on! What do you expect?! Quantum physics? Deep philosophy? Shoot, run, kill, shoot, kill, blow up, shoot, etc. It's a good time killer/waster and very entertaining. It's all very tongue-n-cheek shooter.  CONS: Requires a pretty strong GPU is you crank-up the settings such as the multisampling setting. It can choke some GPUs. That's all I can think of. Not much else to say about it. Enjoy!

												This game is a lot of fun, I mean you can pretty much hook yourself in to an IV of food and water to keep yourself alive while you completely obliterate any spare time you might have considered having.   There's points where you're faced with alien onslaughts and it's crazy trying to maneuver around their different techniques, and it's complete chaos along with a pretty interesting story line/objective campaign.And you also get a rocket launcher.. I mean... Do you really need any more information?Rocket. Launcher.			",69,2,0,10,8,0,3

And so good to hear Sam's voice again.Graphic : The game looks gorgeous. Water effects, shadows,enemy everything looks awesome.Gameplay : The game stars slow, but after the 3rd or 4th level it becomes more serious !!Really Recommend this game, if you like the first and second game YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME !!!!

												When duke nukem fails, BFE wins.Bfe is as funny as its predecessor. As usual don't expect a good storyline.The whole new style is nice, the soundtrack too but of course, some new features disgusted me.First, I can't get used to that run thing, it's just not natural in a serious sam (no mo' run n gun).Secondly, WHERE'S THE CHAINSAW?! How in the hellthe hammer can be a good replacement?! Where are the dual colts? Where's the thompson? Where's the good old shotgun who only needed to pump after each shot and didn't necessite any reload?The melee system is a big joke, when you're surrounded by ennemies it won't help you at all.Of course, this game is far from bad bad but, eh, I can't get used to some of the new thing. Fortunately, the workshop is here..14/20			",121,19,1,13,5,1,11

												Serious Sam 3 is a glorious nod back to the waves of attacking enemies that faced you in the original Doom games. Nothing towards the end of 2011 (in FPS terms) even comes close to the manic reload & fire action of SS3. Little story. Hardly any background filler - pretty much zero character progression.But do we care? Not at all. SS3 is all about survival. With completely OTT weaponry taking on increasingly OTT enemies - it's a great cerebral diversion. No planning ahead. No kit customisations in order to make sure you get the job done. Simply load up and go in with all barrels blazing.SS3 is built upon the new Serious Engine 3.5 as well, meaning with all the bells & whistles turned on, it is a graphically sumptuous game to look at. Is it very scalable too, so even low end PCs could happily run SS3 with some options reduced or disabled.Great effort, great game.... 7.5/10			",325,46,21,42,39,2,85

												This game is really awesome and I definitely recommend it! The graphics are pretty awesome and the game is overall funny to play. You might find that the monsters in the game are a little repetitive, but it's just such a fun game that you'll get over it. This is one of those games that you'd play when you're trying to blow off steam. The only thing I hate about this game is that the directions on how to play in different multi-player modes are not clear. The storyline is decent so I definitely recommend playing with friends in Co-Op mode or multi-player. Smashing and bashing the enemies on this game is just epic. I probably won't be getting bored of this game any time soon. 9/10			",59,13,0,7,5,0,12

												Serious Sam 3 BFE is actually a prequel of the previous Serious Sam games, with BFE meaning Before First Encounter. You’ll see a lot of similarities between the main character Sam Stone, and Duke Nukem, the other super macho hero from around the same gaming era. The games are quite different though. Where Duke Nukem Forever (the latest Duke game) tried to model itself as a modern shooter, Serious Sam 3 sticks to its roots of being a You vs 10000 enemies type horde shooter. Each enemy has just enough life that you need to focus your fire on them as a hundred others come running at you. You’ll spend a lot of the game running backwards as you lay down the fire.Unlike the previous Serious Sam games (First Encounter, Second Encounter, Serious Sam 2) BFE takes place in the future. Unfortunately, in this future the Earth has been overrun by aliens and the whole game occurs in devastated cities and ancient Egyptian ruins. Serious Sam 3’s story is mostly about how Sam needs to activate and use an ancient Sirian (alien) device called the Time Lock, which will allow him to go back in time and prevent the alien invasion.  There isn’t really a primary antagonist for the game, although Sam’s old enemy Mental (the boss in previous games) is mentioned as being the leader of the aliens. BFE is an old school first person shooter with loads of health/ammo pickups, loads of enemies, and a bunch of big♥♥♥♥♥bosses to fight. The sheer number of enemies practically guarantees that you take damage in every engagement, but there’s so much health and armor laying around that the game is a huge survival match.  This is one of those games where I would actually recommend people to play on one of the easier difficulties the first time through. There’s a lot of stress relief to be found in blowing up hundreds of enemies with a wide assortment of weapons. Get used to holding down the trigger button as you back up and sidestep enemies charging after you. The game also has a ton of secrets to find, generally health/ammo/weapons. These are the old school secrets where you actually have to look for them by climbing over walls or busting through barricades. In a lot of modern games the secrets are just out of the way like in a dead end corridor or under a staircase. This is not the case in Serious Sam 3. You can play through this whole game and only find about 5 out of 100+ secrets unless you know what you’re looking for. Pros:+While the story is forgettable, the game has pretty nice graphics with a bunch of weapons to choose from. The thousands of enemies you face means that you’re going to really in the action most of the time. +There actually seem to still be multiplayer servers running. The game’s co-op mode is pretty fun.+Giant bosses! Cons:-Yes, the game can be brainless at times, but that’s part of its charm . Do note however, that there is some annoying puzzle solving to be done in the game. It’s usually about finding keys to locked doors or opening wall panels to get out of underground chambers.-Even on easy mode the game can be difficult (for impatient people). The difficulty setting doesn’t seem to affect the number of enemies you face, just how much life and damage dealing power they have. Near the end there are sections with infinite rocket launcher ammo and seemingly thousands of enemies rushing you.Overall, Serious Sam 3 is a fun game, and if you enjoyed the previous ones you’ll like the modern update. If you’ve only played Serious Sam 2, note that part 2 is quite different from the others in the series (more focused on humor). Serious Sam 3 is more focused on big guns mowing down aliens.

												It's not like the Serious Sam that I remembered. It feels like a Call of Duty knockoff with the initial stages in Cairo. I was half expecting some kind of Middle East covert op. You should play the original Serious Sam, with the pyramids. They have interesting situations like when the temple lights suddenly turn off and then you get surrounded by monsters.I'll play more but I'm a bit more upset with how it was done. I'll see if I change my review later. EDIT: Changed my review to like. I had to play with cheats but it was so much more fun when I did it.PROS1. FastEverything is fast. I like the movement speed which is similar to the old Serious Sam. Even better with cheat speed Turbo and the jetpack (Last Boss)2. CannonballMy favourite weapon3. Last BossI loved the how you had to use the iron poles to attract the lightning to kill the last boss. I liked the Sandworm dueling the Last Boss too.4. SandwormI love the Sandworm. Wished there was a boss battle with it.CONS1. ConfusionFeels like a COD knockoff. It's as if they had a map of Cairo made by a cheap group then threw in the Serious Sam aliens for NPCs.2. EnvironmentDoesn't make much sense. It's like Croteam just decided to flub the development with cheap♥♥♥♥♥voice acting. It's also very bland. Desert, ruins, more desert. Some pyramids and canyons.3. WeaponsPistols and shotguns just don't make the cut at the higher levels. I was hoping that Croteam would make even bigger and badder weapons.Sure, it can be ridiculous like the Cannonball but it makes it fun.4. Right Click is not UsedYou don't use Right Click for anything except zooming the sniper rifle and blowing up the C4 (Please note that technology has moved on and C4 is the equivalent of using dynamite). This isn't a Mac game.SUGGESTIONS1. Serious Sam WeaponsHadouken/Kamehameha (I just like this)Big♥♥♥♥♥Chain Saw Blade Boomerang Launchers (Huge♥♥♥♥♥Boomerang Chain Saw Blades)Lightning Storm Guns (For chaining electrocution to many enemies, looks pretty cool in my mind)Sam-in-the-Box (Imagine a jack-in-the-box punching glove. Instant knockback or death) Upgradeable Sledgehammer to Thor's Hammer(To bring a gigantic smashdown on your enemies)2. Use the Right ClickEven aiming down the sights would be fine. Refer to Shadow Warrior, Unreal, for ideas.3. More Aerial CombatThe Jetpack was fun. Imagine lots of enemies, a mini-boss and lots of jumping around and shooting. Don't land in the wrong spot.

												Serious Sam 3: BFE takes places before the events of Serious Sam 1 First Encounter and Second Encounter. The game sticks to it's roots which is a mindless shoot'em up arena shooter. Shoot all the enemies, to move on. Lots of loot to be found and secrets to be explored. The game is not too closely related to Serious Sam 2.  GREAT co-op game.No graphical issues for me.Multiplayer is a bit bare, which is a shame it's lot of fun.Difficulty is a wide range, not on ly do you have something like 5-7 difficulty settings, you can tweak the difficulty and make it even harder in co-op.Similar Games: Painkiller. If you like SS3 make sure to check out the rest of the series.Has tools for you to make your own content			",152,19,3,3,7,1,16

												I've always been a fan of the old school run-gun-fun style of first-person shooters compared to call of duty or battlefield and Serious Sam 3 BFE is an excellent call-back to that era of gaming. The fastest way to describe it would be to call it the first Serious Sam game wearing the mask of a modern FPS. The level design varies from the ruins of Cairo to ancient Egyptian cities but all feature three main things. Large open ares, massive hordes and big damm guns. Theres quite a bit of variation in enemies and weapons to keep it from getting repetitive but having said this, some enemy attacks can become very annoying, especially when you've just grabbed a minigun are in the zone. Overall, it's a very enjoyable game with some funny dialogue and satisfying gameplay.			",48,2,0,2,0,0,1

												Ok, so I've only been playing for about an hour, and Iv'e aready had to go against everything other fps games have taught me. In this game you DO fire wildly at the genral dicrection of the enemy, you DO use melee as a primary, you DO sprint blindly at hordes of enemys while firing, you DONT run for cover, you DONT skillfully take out the enemys one by one. A truly fantastic game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Serious Sam 3 BFE is actually a prequel of the previous Serious Sam games, with BFE meaning Before First Encounter. You’ll see a lot of similarities between the main character Sam Stone, and Duke Nukem, the other super macho hero from around the same gaming era. The games are quite different though. Where Duke Nukem Forever (the latest Duke game) tried to model itself as a modern shooter, Serious Sam 3 sticks to its roots of being a You vs 10000 enemies type horde shooter. Each enemy has just enough life that you need to focus your fire on them as a hundred others come running at you. You’ll spend a lot of the game running backwards as you lay down the fire.Unlike the previous Serious Sam games (First Encounter, Second Encounter, Serious Sam 2) BFE takes place in the future. Unfortunately, in this future the Earth has been overrun by aliens and the whole game occurs in devastated cities and ancient Egyptian ruins. Serious Sam 3’s story is mostly about how Sam needs to activate and use an ancient Sirian (alien) device called the Time Lock, which will allow him to go back in time and prevent the alien invasion.  There isn’t really a primary antagonist for the game, although Sam’s old enemy Mental (the boss in previous games) is mentioned as being the leader of the aliens. BFE is an old school first person shooter with loads of health/ammo pickups, loads of enemies, and a bunch of big♥♥♥♥♥bosses to fight. The sheer number of enemies practically guarantees that you take damage in every engagement, but there’s so much health and armor laying around that the game is a huge survival match.  This is one of those games where I would actually recommend people to play on one of the easier difficulties the first time through. There’s a lot of stress relief to be found in blowing up hundreds of enemies with a wide assortment of weapons. Get used to holding down the trigger button as you back up and sidestep enemies charging after you. The game also has a ton of secrets to find, generally health/ammo/weapons. These are the old school secrets where you actually have to look for them by climbing over walls or busting through barricades. In a lot of modern games the secrets are just out of the way like in a dead end corridor or under a staircase. This is not the case in Serious Sam 3. You can play through this whole game and only find about 5 out of 100+ secrets unless you know what you’re looking for. Pros:+While the story is forgettable, the game has pretty nice graphics with a bunch of weapons to choose from. The thousands of enemies you face means that you’re going to really in the action most of the time. +There actually seem to still be multiplayer servers running. The game’s co-op mode is pretty fun.+Giant bosses! Cons:-Yes, the game can be brainless at times, but that’s part of its charm . Do note however, that there is some annoying puzzle solving to be done in the game. It’s usually about finding keys to locked doors or opening wall panels to get out of underground chambers.-Even on easy mode the game can be difficult (for impatient people). The difficulty setting doesn’t seem to affect the number of enemies you face, just how much life and damage dealing power they have. Near the end there are sections with infinite rocket launcher ammo and seemingly thousands of enemies rushing you.Overall, Serious Sam 3 is a fun game, and if you enjoyed the previous ones you’ll like the modern update. If you’ve only played Serious Sam 2, note that part 2 is quite different from the others in the series (more focused on humor). Serious Sam 3 is more focused on big guns mowing down aliens.

												It's not like the Serious Sam that I remembered. It feels like a Call of Duty knockoff with the initial stages in Cairo. I was half expecting some kind of Middle East covert op. You should play the original Serious Sam, with the pyramids. They have interesting situations like when the temple lights suddenly turn off and then you get surrounded by monsters.I'll play more but I'm a bit more upset with how it was done. I'll see if I change my review later. EDIT: Changed my review to like. I had to play with cheats but it was so much more fun when I did it.PROS1. FastEverything is fast. I like the movement speed which is similar to the old Serious Sam. Even better with cheat speed Turbo and the jetpack (Last Boss)2. CannonballMy favourite weapon3.

												Only people who love massive guns and explosions killing a massive amount of baddies should play this..... and I hope you are one of those because you are in for a treat.  This is one of the best first person shooters I've played.  Not because of realism or story, but pure action and enjoyment from blowing endless amounts of aliens into little bits and enjoying the graphics while doing it.  There is also some humor in the game that made me laugh, but not on the scale of say Borderlands.  Beat the game solo and it was great.  Also played with co-op and it was great.  Tried to do versus and got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me ;). PS:  If you can last longer than 5min in survival mode (solo), record it and send me the link.  I really want to see it.			",113,4,1,4,7,0,9

This one goes back with that style and it is the true essence of Serious Sam Game. Lots of monsters, epic music and great graphics! If there is going to0 be a new episode of SS, I hope it's going to be like this one. The game is great to play in single player, but I suggest this game in COOP mode with your friends. If you like mass killing and having fun with cool weapons and kill lots of monsters and enemies you should get Serious Sam 3 BFE.			",119,33,3,7,10,2,5

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Serious Sam 3 BFE. Seriously Serious Savagery From Sam's Shotgun Shells.Genre: FPS Large-Scale Linear Arena Shooter. Single, Co-Op & Multiplayer. Modding Support.Developed & Published by: Croteam & Devolver DigitalPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux.DRM: SteamWorks.Business Model: Single Purchase + Expansion DLCCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsSerious Sam 3 BFG (as well as the rest of the entries) are all about Sam trying to save Earth from a never ending army of alien monsters led by a mysterious overlord named ""Mental"". The player is tasked with running through arena after arena where they must kill all the enemies in order to keep progressing. There's a variety of weapons to choose from including a sledgehammer, double-barreled shotgun, RPG launcher, alien laser weapon all the way up to a literal cannon. The challenge isn't the individual enemies themselves but the constant torrential downpour of them as they charge at you. Add enemies with ranged attacks, a giant open area where they can come at you from all sides and you've got a recipe for an intense experience of destruction and survival. The enemy AI is brain dead as they'll repeat the same attack patterns over and over again. What makes them dangerous the sheer number of them and how much they'll hurt if they land a shot. Most enemies are dangerous to touch, which makes using the hammer as you go later into the game a dicey affair. Not impossible and a hell of a lot of fun, but dicey. As such, you'll need to keep moving and strafing to the left or right to dodge their attacks. There are a range of enemies from yelling beheaded kamikazes and harpies to acid throwing giant spiders and two-legged mechanoids bristling with rocket launchers and lasers. When enemies are killed, there's an explosion of dust that will obfuscate the area behind them. The most aggravating enemy to me are the Kleers, these running skeleton chargers pack a punch and are difficult to avoid. So, not only do you have to keep your eyes peeled for the next enemies coming your way, you have to keep in mind any enemies you dodged/didn't kill and listen for any you may not have noticed coming your way. Fortunately for Sam, enemies telegraph themselves with loud sounds that are immediately distinguishable from the cacophony of weapons' firing. Which you'll need as some of these fights can last for a long time and it can be trying, if not exhilarating to keep up with everything.Most weapons in the game for both Sam and the enemies are projectile weapons with a few hitscan weapons including the assault rifle. Nearly all the weapons are a joy to use, even the pistol with it's somewhat weak damage. My personal favorites are the XPML21 Rocket Launcher, SBC Cannon (because badasses love cannons) and XM-214-A Minigun. I'd say my only major complaint about the combat mechanics is that it's really stingy with ammo for the higher-end weapons while providing a ton of ammo for the shotgun. There are also some enemies that have hitscan weapons that I'm not a big fan of either.I remain impressive that SS3 continues to hold up today when stacked up against the current kings of the FPS genre. The gameplay design may be simplistic at first glance, but there is a depth and purity to the chaos that helps it to remain enjoyable even five years after I started playing. Dodging and weaving through the hordes still hasn't gotten old. Even the graphics still hold up even if some minor objects in the environment look a bit questionable. And the badass soundtrack accents the action perfectly as well.Narrative TalkSS3 takes place before the events of Serious Sam: The First Encounter. Humanity is losing the war against Mental and has tasked Sam and his team with locating and protecting a scientist. This scientist believes that he has located an ancient artifact that may turn the tide of war in their favor. The Time Lock, a device that could send people back in time in order to assassinate Mental before the war ever started. What follows is a lengthy campaign where Sam has to locate the Time Lock and the generators to turn it on. Thus transporting him to the events of The First Encounter. The story is pretty simplistic with a lot of the dialogue being handled over a radio conversation with ""Command"" and in cutscenes. Characters don't go through any arcs, nothing really surprising happens, it's just a straight shot (with detours) to the goal of turning on the Time Lock. Certainly there's a underlying tension about how Earth is losing the war but it never really seems to get to Sam. Jewel of the Nile DLC's story is about turning on a third generator that's apparently required to turn the Time Lock on. So I guess we're supposed to assume that it was done off-screen during the main campaign. Serious Sam is an endearing character filled with one-liners and quips while maintaining a serious atmosphere about himself.  He can be a bit simple at times but it's part of his charm. This seemingly invincible soldier can get the job done. He just needs a few guns and explosives.PC Settings and Audio/VideoThe extensive options that the game provides is impressive. If you want to tweak something about Serious Sam, it'll let you. The Serious Sam Engine 3.5 shows off impressive vistas, lighting and bloody gibs galore while you fight hundreds of monsters. This shooter takes place largely in Egypt. So, expect to see plenty of sand, deserts and pyramids. Though there's the occasional town and oasis to break things up. There's even some destructible terrain thrown in at times, though the levels are largely static. The game is very well optimized and I don't recall having any maddening issues such as crashing or bugs. Even more impressive is the support of up to 16 people in co-op and multiplayer. I've always wanted to get a LAN party like that setup just to see how crazy that would be. Alas, I've never had the chance. (16 co-op isn't restricted to LAN but it probably works the best over LAN rather than Internet).Final ThoughtsSerious Sam 3: BFE remains one of my favorite FPSes to come back to every now and again.  Both the base game and the expansion DLC: Jewel of the Nile are well worth playing through even if it's only for the single player content. The multiplayer community isn't worth joining but co-op definitely is if you can get some friends involved. I have no complaints with the campaign, it's nicely paced and lengthy enough with plenty of interesting combat sections. Same goes for the DLC, though the difficulty is definitely higher than the base game. I think that Serious Sam 3 is well worth picking up even after all of these years. Go get Serious Sam 3 and prepare for War!Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] ",242,50,2,39,45,3,57

												This game reminds me so much of the online MonsterHunt in the first Unreal Tournament (NOT Invasion in UT2004). The game doesn't send enemies at you in waves in arenas. No, you have to keep pushing and pushing further on the map through the enemies.Luckily, there are often places where you can take a break too. And you will want to. The fights in this game are incredibly intense. I simply had to just stop and take some deep breaths and relax abit. You find a minigun and never stop firing it for like 5 minutes, because the game just keeps throwing them at you, while you dodge chained cannonballs.The jokes could be better. I discovered this game when I played Shadow Warrior. I heard he's kinda like Duke, so I expected him to be funnier.Do be careful when playing this game for longer sessions. Dodging the rain of projectiles requires a lot of concentration and may cause headache withtin 1-2 hours.8/10 would spread democracy at 3000 freedoms per minute again.			",57,3,1,1,2,0,2

												An excellent edition to the series that does exactly what SS1 did so well - fast and fluid controls and gameplay with great weapons and hordes of enemies to use them on. To to it all off, it does this while looking wonderful. My only criticisms are a) that unless you play it with a friend it can get kind of boring, and b) my main gripe - there is not much variation in the type of locations.8/10			",286,54,2,37,37,0,28

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Serious Sam 3 BFE. Seriously Serious Savagery From Sam's Shotgun Shells.Genre: FPS Large-Scale Linear Arena Shooter. Single, Co-Op & Multiplayer. Modding Support.Developed & Published by: Croteam & Devolver DigitalPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux.DRM: SteamWorks.Business Model: Single Purchase + Expansion DLCCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsSerious Sam 3 BFG (as well as the rest of the entries) are all about Sam trying to save Earth from a never ending army of alien monsters led by a mysterious overlord named ""Mental"". The player is tasked with running through arena after arena where they must kill all the enemies in order to keep progressing. There's a variety of weapons to choose from including a sledgehammer, double-barreled shotgun, RPG launcher, alien laser weapon all the way up to a literal cannon. The challenge isn't the individual enemies themselves but the constant torrential downpour of them as they charge at you. Add enemies with ranged attacks, a giant open area where they can come at you from all sides and you've got a recipe for an intense experience of destruction and survival. The enemy AI is brain dead as they'll repeat the same attack patterns over and over again. What makes them dangerous the sheer number of them and how much they'll hurt if they land a shot. Most enemies are dangerous to touch, which makes using the hammer as you go later into the game a dicey affair. Not impossible and a hell of a lot of fun, but dicey. As such, you'll need to keep moving and strafing to the left or right to dodge their attacks. There are a range of enemies from yelling beheaded kamikazes and harpies to acid throwing giant spiders and two-legged mechanoids bristling with rocket launchers and lasers. When enemies are killed, there's an explosion of dust that will obfuscate the area behind them. The most aggravating enemy to me are the Kleers, these running skeleton chargers pack a punch and are difficult to avoid. So, not only do you have to keep your eyes peeled for the next enemies coming your way, you have to keep in mind any enemies you dodged/didn't kill and listen for any you may not have noticed coming your way. Fortunately for Sam, enemies telegraph themselves with loud sounds that are immediately distinguishable from the cacophony of weapons' firing. Which you'll need as some of these fights can last for a long time and it can be trying, if not exhilarating to keep up with everything.Most weapons in the game for both Sam and the enemies are projectile weapons with a few hitscan weapons including the assault rifle. Nearly all the weapons are a joy to use, even the pistol with it's somewhat weak damage. My personal favorites are the XPML21 Rocket Launcher, SBC Cannon (because badasses love cannons) and XM-214-A Minigun. I'd say my only major complaint about the combat mechanics is that it's really stingy with ammo for the higher-end weapons while providing a ton of ammo for the shotgun. There are also some enemies that have hitscan weapons that I'm not a big fan of either.I remain impressive that SS3 continues to hold up today when stacked up against the current kings of the FPS genre. The gameplay design may be simplistic at first glance, but there is a depth and purity to the chaos that helps it to remain enjoyable even five years after I started playing. Dodging and weaving through the hordes still hasn't gotten old. Even the graphics still hold up even if some minor objects in the environment look a bit questionable. And the badass soundtrack accents the action perfectly as well.Narrative TalkSS3 takes place before the events of Serious Sam: The First Encounter. Humanity is losing the war against Mental and has tasked Sam and his team with locating and protecting a scientist. This scientist believes that he has located an ancient artifact that may turn the tide of war in their favor. The Time Lock, a device that could send people back in time in order to assassinate Mental before the war ever started. What follows is a lengthy campaign where Sam has to locate the Time Lock and the generators to turn it on. Thus transporting him to the events of The First Encounter. The story is pretty simplistic with a lot of the dialogue being handled over a radio conversation with ""Command"" and in cutscenes. Characters don't go through any arcs, nothing really surprising happens, it's just a straight shot (with detours) to the goal of turning on the Time Lock. Certainly there's a underlying tension about how Earth is losing the war but it never really seems to get to Sam. Jewel of the Nile DLC's story is about turning on a third generator that's apparently required to turn the Time Lock on. So I guess we're supposed to assume that it was done off-screen during the main campaign. Serious Sam is an endearing character filled with one-liners and quips while maintaining a serious atmosphere about himself.  He can be a bit simple at times but it's part of his charm. This seemingly invincible soldier can get the job done. He just needs a few guns and explosives.PC Settings and Audio/VideoThe extensive options that the game provides is impressive. If you want to tweak something about Serious Sam, it'll let you. The Serious Sam Engine 3.5 shows off impressive vistas, lighting and bloody gibs galore while you fight hundreds of monsters. This shooter takes place largely in Egypt. So, expect to see plenty of sand, deserts and pyramids. Though there's the occasional town and oasis to break things up. There's even some destructible terrain thrown in at times, though the levels are largely static. The game is very well optimized and I don't recall having any maddening issues such as crashing or bugs. Even more impressive is the support of up to 16 people in co-op and multiplayer. I've always wanted to get a LAN party like that setup just to see how crazy that would be. Alas, I've never had the chance. (16 co-op isn't restricted to LAN but it probably works the best over LAN rather than Internet).Final ThoughtsSerious Sam 3: BFE remains one of my favorite FPSes to come back to every now and again.  Both the base game and the expansion DLC: Jewel of the Nile are well worth playing through even if it's only for the single player content. The multiplayer community isn't worth joining but co-op definitely is if you can get some friends involved. I have no complaints with the campaign, it's nicely paced and lengthy enough with plenty of interesting combat sections. Same goes for the DLC, though the difficulty is definitely higher than the base game. I think that Serious Sam 3 is well worth picking up even after all of these years. Go get Serious Sam 3 and prepare for War!Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] ",242,50,2,39,45,3,57

												It's your usual Serious Sam game, but on an engine that actually looks good instead of looking like a Unity3D game.  Expect the usual; 1000+ enemies on screen at once, 20 weapons in total, and♥♥♥♥♥♥in your pants the moment you hear ""AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH"" Definitely worth picking up when you get the chance, provided you have at least two people to make sure they don't all focus on you 100% of the time.Also, this game may have unknowingly inspired the new Doom's ""glory-kill"" mechanic. :\Brief mention: this game is also the most well-optimized game you'll probably ever see from the last five years.  Performance is unreasonably good, the options menu makes Mad Max look consolized, and it's divided nicely into CPU Performance / GPU Speed / GPU Performance with five presets each.So yeah, good purchase, good use of the money I previously wasted on id's Rage and its awful engine.

												I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game! Great Graphics, old-school run & gun gameplay, and funny one-liners. Serious Sam has got to be one of the best franchises I have ever played. Serious Sam 3 may be the perfect blend of old school and modern in a game yet. But there are a few things about this game I do not like.One of the things I do not like about this game is they changed the jumping height compared to the other games. The jumping feels odd and floaty. It is like they changed the jumping height at the last minute before they released this game so players would not jump over walls in the first few levels of the game.Another thing I do not like is the sound effects and animation for some of the weapons. The pump-action shotgun and M4 Machine gun feels and sounds under-powered. The animations are kind of lame also that doesn't display the power that the weapon very well.The reloading feature in this game is a mixed bag for me. It sometimes gets in the way of the action, but that does give the game more challenge. Would I want to disable the reloading, yes and no, but I will pass on this being a negative.BUT... You can change these negatives to positives through the Steam Workshop. You can get mods that replace the weapons sounds and animation with better ones and there is also a mod that enhances the jumping in the game to match with the previous games.Do I recommend this game? If you are into fast-paced old school FPS games, then HELL ♥♥♥♥ING YES I RECOMMEND THIS!!!!			",344,53,7,18,22,0,14

												It's not nearly as great as the first two games (First and Second Encounter), but it is still a decent game. If you haven't played them I would recommend getting the HD versions of said games before playing  BFE. The following will mainly be my criticism of the game since I believe most reviewers summed up the positives well enough. The begining to the game is somewhat slow and boring, accelerated only slightly by the secret more advanced weapons (if you find them), it gets better after the first 3 or 4 missions. You lose health a lot quicker in this game compared to the first two simply because a lot of the basic grunts are equipped with bullet firing human firearms which are impossible to dodge. Some of the basic grunts are still equipped with the good old futuristic guns firing slow moving projectiles from the First and Second Encounter, which could be dodged even when there were massive hales coming at you if you were skilled enough, but they appear to be in the minority. As far as I can recall (it has been a while since I last played it) certain weapons from Serious Sam The Second Encounter are missing in this game, most notably the Flamethrower and the Chainsaw. The only new weapon added, The Syrian Bracelet is largely impractical to use in combat since it takes ages to kill stuff with it and larger enemies are effectivelly impervious to it (if you have multiple people using it at the same time it is also effective against the big enemies, but is still slow to use), hence it is largely a token irrelevant addition, even if you can perform some rather nice looking executions with it. The quick melee executions while fun are too powerful, particularly early on into the game where there is a relatively low amount of enemies. It is infinitely more effective to simply snap the necks of grunts or tear away the spider's shells rather then shooting them, which gets a bit silly after you repeat it in sequence as often as you do. However as the game goes on this becomes less of an issue as it is almost impossible to use against massive hordes of enemies, without the monsters butchering you whilst you are locked into a short execution cutscene.With the exception of Ugh-Zan IV, all the ""bosses"" in the game are a disappointment. Most of them are really just minibosses and serve as introductions for enemies you will encounter regularly. The only other boss in the game apart from Ugh-Zan IV, which isn't a miniboss, is the Alcor class Warship, which I personally am loath to even consider a boss, since it doesn't really fight you, it just spawns an endless stream of mobs. The Jewel of the Nile DLC boss is ok despite being boring due to a lack of variation in attacks, the largest issue with him being that he is a colossal bullet sponge and as such you run out of ammunition long before he runs out of health and have to spend ages finishing him off with a pistol (which is kind of a problem considering that while his projectiles are easy enough to avoid, they kill you instantly upon contact, meaning you have no room for error).The enemy variety in the game isn't bad, albeit I feel that more new enemy types could have been added. However two of the new enemy types, the Witch Bride of Achriman and the Technopolip, are poorly designed and just a general nuissance to deal with. In the case of the technopolip, the infested helicopter is extremely hard to hit, particularly with the rocket launcher, meaning that you waste too long looking at the sky trying to line up a proper shot, whilst hordes of enemies require you to keep your eyes on the ground. What is worse its bullets cannot be dodged, meaning that you just have to hide behind cover all the time. This game isn't Call of Duty, its all about mobility and fast paced action, so why make an enemy which inhibits just that? The witch bride is even worse, particularly if there are multiple of them. This is because if you don't immediately start shooting them after they appear, (after enough damage has been dealt to them they will disappear and teleport to a new location after a delay) they will incapacitate you by slowing your movements and then levitate you slightly whilst dealing damage to you. This wouldn't be an issue in and of itself, however when you are being swarmed by a large group of enemies they will mean the death of you if you don't dispatch of them ASAP. Since they slow you down and make you levitate if you don't notice where they are and shoot them in time they will prevent you from moving meaning the other enemies will encircle you resulting in effectivelly instantaneous death. Since it is hard to notice where they are going to teleport to next when you are busy with crowds of other enemies, they far too often cause you to die in a really cheesy unsatisfying way. However by far the biggest issue I had with the game was the fact that on my PC the game suffered from quite common micro frame drops, meaning every 2 minutes or so the game would drop to 1 fps and seemingly freeze for about half a second. The game otherwise ran well, but no fixes suggested on the forums proved conducive to removing this issue. Nonetheless while annoying this didn't make the game unplayable for me. Furthermore while relatively common it doesn't seem to be a technical difficulty experienced by a majority of the player base, hence if you are looking to buy this game, it probably won't affect you.

												I grew up playing the first Serious Sam. I still remember the first time I played it as it was put as a demo at a pc exhibition and I stood there playing the game the whole day and went back the next day not to see more pc but to play serious sam.Serious Sam 3 is an epic masterclass of its own and its mindless hours fun. When you die you feel like ripping someones soul off but when you get an awesome kill, your on cloud 9. This game is not made for a storyline although theres one going on in the background but 95% of players dont even care about it so dont look forward a enchanting story.1/10 - IGN - not COD.

												A generic nostalgia fake-revival game, which is a consolized first encounter, including dumb pyramids AGAIN. So, basically they removed most weapons, added some generic tacticool boring hitscans, added a lot of useless hitscan enemies and a lot of annoying hostile timewasters. In level-design they shrank everything and included captain price giving you sudden death if you go out of intended path. On top of it you now may enjoy endless pitch black onaholes infested with crab louses.At least some core gameplay is the same — you stand in the fartherst corner of the map and shoot your gun until green crosshair turns into red, or you run around getting kicked in the posterior by kleers. Also now there are press X to melee, because of course it would be there.Music is some faux-ethno annoying cymbals which is worsened by the greatest invention of all times — dynamic music (which means it randomly starts and stops, creating utter κακοφωνία right in your ears).Well at least writing is okay, and it's funny to see Sejic in the credits. It took me two and a half years to finish main campaign. SSam never was a masterpiece and this one is even more boring. Most of the game i completed little by little each time when i tested new hardware to see if my performance increased, because it run very bad on my base PC and still drops FPS on GF970SLI and i7 on sub high settings. And the settings are the best part of the whole game and have most gameplay and player agency in them. Game runs fine at UHD UWS and offers good customization of HUD etc.Oh, and christmas achievment is bugged.			",1149,447,60,172,143,12,270

												Criticizing SS3 6 years later is pointless, especially with its positive rating here. But I can't turn away now that the exercise of seriousness has turned to mediocrity and tediousness.It's baffling how SS3 has almost no unique and fun secrets (wow, I've found a piece of armor around the corner... for the hundredth time!), compared to older games in the series. Too many secrets are hidden behind annoying parkour. What's more, weapon placement is not well-thought; during several starting levels you're forced to use shotguns and assault rifle, whereas in old Encounters you'd see almost all gear by the first major boss. Ammo backpacks that restore all ammo are removed to force you to look for ~S E C R E T~ ammo pick-ups. Iconic Serious Bomb is nowhere to be seen. Very few memorable skirmishes where you go all-out, and when it happens you vomit blood — the last level of this game is an insult to carefully crafted The Great Pyramid and The Grand Cathedral final levels from the classics. Overall the level design is abysmal with identical areas all over the place. Also painfully slow pitch-dark horror sections in egyptian pyramid tombs. SS3 has extremely cheap new types of enemies who are either invulnerable to certain attacks and/or can disable you from afar. On harder difficulties the game forces you to backtrack to ammo crates (ammo crates with infinite ammo in Serious Sam, it speaks for itself~), because playing without C4 is the opposite of rewarding experience. Projectile enemies are extremely accurate now even a kilometer away from you, forcing the player to use cover on harder difficulties. So much for All Man No Cover mantra.Everything in this game is a downgrade from older games. I've been repeating verb ""force"" again and again, because this game is a ""forced"" Serious Sam entry, it tryhards to be more serious than it should be. Serious Sam 2 was getting a lot of hate in its own time, but it's, in fact, a much better game than this abomination. You're better off playing First and Second Encounter HD remakes.

												Seriously, this is definitely my favorite title in the series. As a diehard Doomer, I've just become a fan at last, long after the first Serious Sam released over a decade ago.The very essence is the fast and intuitional gameplay (and all its flexibility), that I hope doing the same/well for DOOM(4). You can shoot and blow up the heck outta the aliens, you can melee through without ammo, you can sprint and BE a runner all the way in this game. Of course, you still can play like an old-school Sammy without reloading or sprinting, always holding-down-trigger-non-stop, only charging and dying in glory. That style(arcade/arena) was not what I truly prefer.As for what previous Serious Sam players care, you might not feel content with the newer one, for the absence of illogical craziness its predecessors had. Serious Sam 3 did most things the 'maturer' way, you won't find too much ridiculous nonsense or anything more 'serious' than exploded Earth :)Croteam also did a great job on the third(actually not) implement itself: decent visuals, sounds, environments, progressing, acting, and the most 'serious' story EVER; everything seems quite balanced for most audiences. Aside from traditional total madness, I believe majority of FPS players may accept and enjoy the game, hardcore or not.+Pros: (or compared with the classics)chaos battles and brutal deathsequally beautiful and majestic sceneryyou can now outrun many enemies (aka skip the horde or run like hell)better item placement (prevents you from wasting time running like a cleaning robot)all your arsenal weapons work functionally better together, even the useless pistol (homage to Doom?)C4 is better than grenades, Devastator is cooler than a sniper rifle, and I'm so glad they took Serious Bomb out because I really hate how it workedmost combat maneuvers against respective foes are reservedsame vigorous epic rocking music that can make you kill more and more and more like the past (especially the later tracks, some of them are extremely nostalgic!)-Cons: (or compared with the classics)huge unique bosses are less than before, but understandablesome classic monsters don't show up, but ignorableKamikazes are far less than annoying due to mapping decisions, but bearablelacking of memorable encounters (I think)no dual revolvers (and swap trick)some finishing moves are not as good and should avoid to usesprinting mechanics could be done bettereven worse collision lets you jump around like a terrible painno stack/step jumping, no werebull riding, no rocket jumping(?)you can barely tell how far away from mobs by their sounds (or just my problem)so many casual fights in rather generic scenes across the campaign, could be too repetitive in coop mode (well for the series they all do)=Neutrals:faster keystroking combat but slower overall walkthrough (some may not favor the pace on first few levels, so as mini riddles and skippable cutscenes throughout the plot)crawling dungeons enhances immersion but somehow cripples fluency (all are short and could be tolerable)songs sometimes could go too serious but not 'serious'(Multiplayer and DLC untouched yet)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is an absolute blast to play.  The game looks stunning even when using low settings.  The only bad point about the game is that the shotgun sounds way to weak. Get this game! Seriously ..... GET IT! It can even run on a mobile processor so it should work well on a large variety of system specifications, however if you don't like the default you customise EVERY graphical setting and I mean everything, so there's a lot of mixing and matching settings which is brilliant. Keep in mind that if your looking for a typical COD clone then this game ins't for you.  It's combining new with old here.  Its more of an old school shooter.Killing enemies is also very satisfying, and you can even tear off heads, hearts and even eyes off enemies and throw them at other enemies. The game even has a seprate Moddable version that you get when buying the game, allowing you to use a whole wealth of workshop content to add new maps, enemies, game modes, weapons and more for free, but if you want to keep the game mod free you can also play the standard version which doesn't support mods.It also features full controller support right from the get go, which means this game works amazingly well with big picture mode or SteamOS.  And ..... it also has .... splitscreen .... seriously (no pun intended) which is rare for a PC game, which makes it even better that this game has controller support.I honestly cannot recommend this game enough, its well worth the price.

												OK OK OK, SERIOUSLY? this is one of the most interesting and original shooter of this generation. Fan have given it a Metascore HIGHER then borderlands 2, and with reasons. To keep it simple, Serious sam has an exelent balance of gameplay, challenge, fun, humor and story. None of the aspect take the other over and you can be a mass murderer of aliens. What not to like? By experience i can even say that it also end up being harder then normal 'FPS'. Suck it up and BUY this game already.			",436,97,0,111,17,1,61

												Remember the good ol' days of fantastic first-person shooters? Remember shooters where you didn't have: turret sections, mud walking, quick-time events, extremely linear levels, pseudo-realistic themes, generic enemies, boring weapons and an all-MURICAN annoying storyline? Serious Sam 3: Before First Encounter remembers!The game is a prequel to Serious Sam: First Encounter of which the earth is suffering an apocalyptic alien invasion. You're Sam ""Serious"" Stone, official unbeaten badass, tasked with the rescue of an archaeologist, Professor Stein, to know the secrets of an ancient piece of alien technology located in the deserts of Egypt. Unfortunatley, the Professor is dead and it's up to Sam to solve all of the problems... and by ""solve"" I mean kill countless number of aliens! The story is simple and it's not the game's main purpose. You have very few characters and most of the ones you do meet end up dying shortly. The cutscenes are basic and their animations are average at least.  The voice acting is quite dodgy is some aspects, however, you'll have a good laugh with Sam's cheesy and funny one-liners. One thing that you'll see very different from other Serious Sam games is the theme. Instead of having a cartoony silly theme, like in previous Serious Sam games, Serious Sam 3 has a more realistic aesthetic to it. The guns look like generic variations from modern military shooters and part of the story is even similar to modern military shooters in terms of its scripting. However, I liked it since there wasn't too much of it to ruin the game and the enemies this time around look much cooler. Don't worry; Serious Sam 3 isn't serious at all! NETRISCA (Sam's database source embedded into his skull) makes its return along with Sam and they improved it's visual appearance along with the presentation of enemies and information. One problem that I have with it is the fact that it takes forever to see all of what the NETRISCA has to say, so everytime you wanna read the description of an enemy you're going have to wait for a couple of annoying seconds until you can read all you need to. But that's not a big issue. I wish NETRISCA could talk like JARVIS from Iron Man, which would be awesome!Let's start with the singleplayer campaign. So what is the formula of Serious Sam? The franchise has always concentrated in wave-based arena fighting of which you have to continuously move around the level to avoid damage and strike your enemies in the most efficient way. The slogan of the game, ""All Man. No Cover!"", is well implemented in the game, it's not just for marketing purposes. The point of Serious Sam is movement and avoiding projectiles as well as enemy melee attacks. It's quite fun doing so and simultaneously requires some skill. If you use cover and stick to one spot only, the game will punish since there is destructible terrain in the game and the enemies are will always close onto you fiercely.There is a big variation of enemies but some are missing from the original games of Serious Sam like the Beheaded Firecracker and the Reptolid (a very tricky one to put down). Fortunatley, you'll find some new enemies like Witch-Bride of Achriman, but I think enemy is badly used in most of the game. In some ways, she could be used as an enemy support-type. The worst enemy is the Technopolip, you can only bring this one down with explosives, I think it restricts the player's freedom of weapon choice and it's quite annoying to take care of. Also I think the Kleer Skeletons (undead horse-like mobile skeletons) are a little bit bullet-spongy than previous Serious Sam games, specially because when you encounter one, a million will follow behind him. I can safley say that the Kamikazes are back and they're still very satisfying to shoot at. I can state that the final boss fight is one the most epic, best and hardest ones I have ever played.Now the level design, a crucial portion of a Serious Sam game! There are some levels that are quite linear and are irritating to go through them since they keep chucking really bullet-spongy enemies at you and that breaks the pacing of the game. These levels go against the formula of Serious Sam but they're still fun. Serious Sam levels are vast of which gives you and the enemies space to maneuver. It may seem boring but you'll feel the pressure as enemies overwhelm you. The difficulty also changes the enemy placement and respawns and all of them are quite dynamic and different.Let's go to the weapons! The weapons have no recoil of any description but it's not a problem since this is an arcade-like game. Some are standard-type weapons (pistol, shotgun, assault-rifle) and the rest are seriously silly weapons (double-baralled shotgun, rocket launcher, automatic shotgun with high-explosive bullets and The CANNON!). In Serious Sam: First Encounter, the melee weapon was the horrible combat knife. The game threw a million enemies against you and the melee weapon was a knife that could only cut butter. Instead of that, Croteam introduced the Sledgehammer. I think it is a good addition to the series since it's responsive and causes a lot of bloody mess. There is no Grenade Launcher; this weapon was replaced with the Auto-Shotgun and that was a good replacement since the predecessor was very sluggish for a Serious Sam game. The Sirian Arm Tech is similar but more gorey, however, it's quite possibly one of the least enjoyable weapon because it takes too long to chop enemies into bits. Overall, these weapons of mass destruction are fun to use!Serious Sam 3: BFE brings back the massive 16-player Co-Op with a new mode: Co-Op Coin. This is a survival co-op hordemode of which you have to score as much as you can before the end of the match. In every so number of points, you get a license to kill and thus you can get to the top of the score board! If you don't like that mode then crank the difficulty up and shoot as many monsters and baddies as you can with your best friends with the standard Co-Op mode! Even though it is a Co-Op mode, you don’t have Co-Op specific functions, not even reviving; it’s only to play with friends. It’s still fun! There is also Competitive Mode but it's not as good as Serious Sam's fantastic Co-Op. In fact, it just makes the Co-Op look better since it’s unbalanced and there are only vanilla-type modes available.  The game has Steam Workshop which features new weapons, community-made campaign maps, graphical mods and code changing mods. So there is a lot to do after beating the original game.  The Serious Engine 3.5 makes a very good looking game and it’s very well optimized for PC! It features a ridiculous options menu, so ridiculous that you'll say to yourself: ""YE GODS! LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE GRAPHICAL OPTIONS!"". In fact, I consider this a new standard for graphical options for PC games. So if your machine runs on a potato, then fear not! But it is a little tricky to use and hard to understand. I had to research some of the options to know what they do. I think it would be best that the Serious Engine 3.5 had a more general options menu without leaving the more specific one out.Regarding the bonus pack, it will only add, in the game, a scope for the Auto-Shotgun, nothing special. The good part of it is the Making of Move and the awesome soundtrack! The music in Serious Sam 3 is much better considering the previous games of which mixes arabic-theme songs with rock music! Beautiful combination.Conclusion....buy the freaking game! It's worth every cent on the price tag and you will not regret for the love of JEBUS! Unless you're not man enough to take up some serious fights! I recommend it!			",232,12,0,18,7,1,19

												Serious Sam games have a special place in my collection. They made pure FPS carnage as fun as it gets. Many FPS games have great combat, but no other game delievered mass mayham as this series did. While the Second game (Serius sam 2 not the second encounter) was a bit questionable (though still good), this game far exceeded what I expected and become the best Serious Sam game to date (on my account anyway).First off a few changes and additions, for better or worse. Some weapons now have manual reloading and aiming down sight. For the most part this hardly has ANY impact on the gameplay. The formula is still the same as before. Go through levels slaughtering hundreds (and thousands) doing few simple puzzles, stomping few bosses etc. There are few distinct changes from the original games which may depend on your taste. The game is little bit less arcadey. It removed the powerups such as Serious Speed, Serious Damage, ammo packs etc. Now all pickups are individual. You can't pick up ammo in bulk anymore meaning you have to search more. Since ammo doesn't float in the air it is more hidden and requires more searching to survive. In my view this is a great thing. It puts stronger emphasis on secrets than ever before. Secrets now feel MUCH more relavent than before, and before they were rather important as well. The health and armor system are intact. Pickups for those just changed models but the function is identical to how it was. (you won't see regenerative health in this game, and shame on you if you even considered the thought).Next change is that you don't have double ammo capacity on Serious difficulty. This is offset by removing the insane claustrophobic encounters you had in first and second encounter. You won't get 30 kleers attacking you in a small enclosed room anymore. You won't have unfair enemy spawn around corner that you have to fully comit to memory or reload your game. There is a new melee finisher system. Most enemies you can outright kill via melee animation. This solves small encounters in enclosed space (from being a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥. but due to time it takes to perform one it isn't recommended for use in a larger fight so it balances it out nicely.The game focuses much  more so on open battles, but due to the improvement on the engine this is in a word glorious. Outside environemnts aren't just big yards anymore. There are buildings, walls, with half of them fully destructible. As rockets start to fly most of your cover will diminish forcing you to adapt, prioritize your targets and move quickly. I honestly didn't feel that the old formula would feel so fresh and fun again but hell it is and I can't stress enough how much fun it is. Your arsenal is nearly identical from the first two games but it did go through some refinement. Shotgun, Double Barreled Coach Gun, Minigun, Rocket Launcher, Sniper Rifle, Laser Gun, SBC Cannon. They are all present with few new additions to spice it up (devestator is tear jerking full of awesome). Models are new and updated as well as their sound. As for their balance and their purpose they are still as fans remember. You will kill a Kleer with a coach gun point blank. You can one shot a minor biomechanoid with a single rocket, etc. All the stuff you remember from first two games will carry over, you will know what gun to use on any old enemy without much thought. This is also the first SS game where two weapons are exclusive to secrets only. You won't find the lasergun and the sniper(and their ammunition) outside of secrets. *This changes in the DLC Jewl of the Nile*The game overall takes a contemporary shooter flavor if I would say. It shows us that you can create a modern shooter with old school mechanics and gameplay and create a quality product.Overall, for the fans of the series, this game might be conflicting for few changes, but safe to say most will embrace it an rejoice we have another Serious Sam game that is not just outstanding, but Seriously outstanding. For newcommers, you are in for a hell of a ride, get your guns at ready and Get Serious.			",216,28,1,21,3,2,18

												Serious Sam 3: BFE - The BFE stands for Before First Encounter, which makes this a prequel to the other Serious Sam games. The story is a simple but effective one - Aliens invade, lots of nasty critters, turn on and go to the time travel doodad and connect up to First Encounter to save earth. As a bonus, you get an auto-translator if you stare at text that shows you some more backstory and other bits of text.At first, it seems like Sam has been reduced to a generic military shooter. Instead of the bright and fast shooting from the Sam games before this one there are basic guns, a grey cityscape, and somewhat basic soldiers you need to shoot like just another chest high wall simulating shooter game. But as you progress you find more interesting things to fight, you get more options, you find the old enemies again, and the environment shifts from generic cityscape to more interesting environments. You get more weapons, and the generic soldier enemies are slowly phased out as you get further in. It once again makes shooting funWith large levels that have plenty of secrets hidden throughout them, exploring is rewarded. There seem to be a few new enemies but I do not think they all worked out that well. Of the ones I do not really like, one is mainly just annoying as it hides from you in what would otherwise be a fast paced game where you can go around avoiding everything through skill and proper manouvring, and the other uses magic to hold you in place in the air while shaking your aim. Luckily, these are not too common and the former can usually be ignored as you do not have to kill them to progress.As is expected of Sam, there is a good co-op mode that allows you to bring one or several friends with you, and the settings are as detailed as they always were to let you customise your experience. Difficulty is not a problem - Sometimes it may feel like you're up against nearly impossible odds, but with a little bit of skill and a little bit of luck you can get through it. While I would not say it is as good as First Encounter, it provides a very solid experience with plenty of amusing moments, Serious Sam 3: BFE will give anyone with an interest plenty of enjoyable hours of play - And then even more if they bring a friend			",162,24,0,26,61,4,94

												Serious sam 3 is one of the few games where it wasn't as good as I remember it. At first I loved it like goty 2011 loved it. then I tried more classic fps ( rise of the triad,blood,shadow warrior,painkiller) and i can say that I feel like the game is average and that's gonna♥♥♥♥♥♥off people so just let me explain why. let's start off with the good it looks pretty,nice sound design, and the game is going back to what made the first encounter enjoyable. the music is a mix bag for me i don't know about you but I find the music to be dull mostly the music that fits with the enviornments personally i'd rather have music that gets you pumped for the action like say doom. the gameplay well they added some unecessary modern mechanics like the iron sights which are about as useful as driving with your head. one of my biggest issues is while it does go back to the old style of serious sam they could at least kept it fresh with say alternate ammo or firing modes and such. In terms of combat i think gamespot put it best ""Action feels more like cleanup than combat"" and that's what it felt like to me throuogh most of the game. the multiplayer is crap especially the deathmatch it's so unbalanced and the maps are poorly designed. The game has a rather inconsistant difficulty i'm not sure if it's fair or unfair i'm not sure cause the game didn't feel balanced to me. oh and also the game doesn't run well like framerate drops and starting it crashes it. so serious sam 3 is a mix bag for me it could have been better let's just say that i think there are better throw back fps like painkiller black or hard reset.  I'm thankfully not the only one who thought serious sam 3 was lackluster especially in comparison to the first game like this guy

												This game is an absolute blast to play.  The game looks stunning even when using low settings.  The only bad point about the game is that the shotgun sounds way to weak. Get this game! Seriously ..... GET IT! It can even run on a mobile processor so it should work well on a large variety of system specifications, however if you don't like the default you customise EVERY graphical setting and I mean everything, so there's a lot of mixing and matching settings which is brilliant. Keep in mind that if your looking for a typical COD clone then this game ins't for you.  It's combining new with old here.  Its more of an old school shooter.Killing enemies is also very satisfying, and you can even tear off heads, hearts and even eyes off enemies and throw them at other enemies. The game even has a seprate Moddable version that you get when buying the game, allowing you to use a whole wealth of workshop content to add new maps, enemies, game modes, weapons and more for free, but if you want to keep the game mod free you can also play the standard version which doesn't support mods.It also features full controller support right from the get go, which means this game works amazingly well with big picture mode or SteamOS.  And ..... it also has .... splitscreen .... seriously (no pun intended) which is rare for a PC game, which makes it even better that this game has controller support.I honestly cannot recommend this game enough, its well worth the price.

												Ok, so let's try to write a review without the word ""Serious"" in it. Ok, I just wrote serious -1- time, but it was to define goal. Ok, that's -2- now.So Serious Sam 3 (that's -3- but it shouldn't count coz it's the game name) is the best brutal & violent FPS I played in years. It's old-shool, like the FPS of the 90's where you actually needed skills, basic orientation capability (ie: you don't cry for mama coz you fear to get lost as soon as there's more than 1 possible path), and health management (no, hiding behind a wall won't give 100% of your health back in 2 seconds).So the game is tough, challenging, fun and well done visually (but not amongst the best) ; so if it's your kind of things, it's a no-brainer, get it already, seriously !( -4- ... Oh, jeez, who wrote this rule about no serious word anyway... -5- ... :-p )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great and fun sequel, but IMO the worst of the series. And what does that mean for the average player ? Nothing, because the older games in the series are so great I doubt it can get better than that. This one is just a bit less great. Most of the things I missed in this game were fixed in the Jewel Of The Nile maps.Positives:- great graphics- blood and gore- insanely huge maps- good soundtrack as always- multiple boss fightsNegatives:- can't compete with the greatness of The Second Encounter- modern Egypt doesn't look as great as ancient Egypt- they went too far with smoke, dust and debries- lack of use of harpies and sniper oriented battles (fixed in JOTN)So, basically the only negative thing about it is that older titles were too good :P			",62,19,3,5,4,0,9

There's nothing more refreshing than getting to kill hundreds of alien invasors with a rocket launcher. Would you like a more down and dirty aproach? NO PROBLEM!! YOU CAN ALWAYS USE THE SLEDGEHAMMER.I grew up with the Serious Sam series and I have to thank the world Croteam managed to survive the jungle that is out there. I can never get enough of your games.

												Serious Sam 3: Brain ♥♥♥♥ed Eygptians is by far the most cleverly written political satire to ever grace the human race with it's iridescent presence. In the infinite wisdom from the omniscient immortals at Croteam, the vicious dictatorship of Hosni ""Mental"" Mubarak is expertly represented as a bunch of suicidal members of the Headless Horsemen's Al Qaeda Alien Death Sect, as the relentless try to halt the glorious charge of Arab Spring Sam.  Defining the phrase ""crackling with sexual energy"", Serious Sam 3: Big Fat Erections is the voice of a generation, it answers the call of gamers craving for something more daring, something more extreme, something to make them touch themselves more furiously and gasp gasmically at the mere though of a controller then any overpriced DLC pack ever could. It calls forth a tension that can only be unjustifyingly compared to being unwittingly caught with a stiffy at a pre-school and having to wade through a sea of reasonably horrified soccer moms and teen parents who shower you with fetuses from their unwanted pregnancies. Serious Sam 3: Boobs Feel Erotic was created with the worlds Macho-Powered Graphics engine which produces a plethora of visuals so real, that the animations are toned down by default to spare thy mind of trying to take in two identical realities at once, and any poor Icarus who dares try to fly higher and adjust the settings will be instantly rendered into a coma by the eye-meltingly good graphics that will literally cause them to drown in their own drool. All of this goodness is spliced in with some of the most dramatic character development ever fathomed by a college dropout from some♥♥♥♥♥♥hole in Europe, with Samuel being so overflowing with emotion, determination, wholesome relatability and butt jokes from 2006, that when the game ends their is a 78% chance the player will promptly suicide because they cannot fathom a world in which Cereal Sam is not by their side whilst gently caressing the back of their carpal tunnel riddled wrist.TL;DR It's dumb, cheap, rips off the plot from majora's mask almost as much as I rip off jokes from TBF, and it's got a helluva ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ripper for a final boss.

												This is what I like about first person shooters!Serious Sam 3: BFE is just pure monster blasting bliss. It's got a paper thin story peppered with sparse cut-scenes, some mild puzzle solving (find the key, blow up a wall here) and lots of great one-liners.No Hollywood actors trying to shoehorn in some absurd plot to immerse you in the realism of war, only a man, lots of guns and hordes of enemies to destroy with an arsenal that ranges from a sledge hamnmer, through your standard shotguns and assault rifles, to a massive cannon and semi automatic explosive shell launcher.The story takes you through the decimated streets of post alien invasion Cairo, under and through a museum, and then eventually deep into the desert and under the pyramids themselves. The developers do a pretty good job of getting a lot out of these big, fairly open levels, but there could have been a little more variety in later stages...your third set of Egyptian ruins starts to look a lot like your first pretty quickly. Where this game and other Sam games really shines, is the variety of enemies. Each with their own methods of attack that range from acid spitting bugs, to mindless shotgun wielding clone troopers, to charging alien bull-beasts, to leaping space monkeys, to mehanized reptialian dual rocket launching abominations...each one requiring a slightly different tactic in order to best destroy it. Serious Sam three won't just toss them at you here and there...it will send them at you in massive wave after wave, and it is so satisfying to take them down.So my overall thoughts: Serious Sam 3: BFE is a lot of fun. It's not deep, or cutting edge, but it's a great looking game that will throw a lot of action at you very quickly. It's kill or be killed, and I've really enjoyed the time I've spent playing.Pros: - Satisfying action- Big, challenging levelsCons:- Could use more level varietyFinal rating: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺8/10 Happy ascii faces ",119,12,20,41,10,0,13

												Now that I've completed Serious Sam 1,2, and 3, I hope to release a YouTube video explaining how I feel about each game and how they hold up. But BFE alone? Honestly, the only real time I was frustrated with this game was when I made the leap from TOURIST mode to SERIOUS mode. Admitably, that was a dumb desicion. But why'd I do it? Because there are ""achievements"" rewarding you for completing the game on Serious difficulty. However, those 20-30 minutes of my little brother calling me out on me swearing under my breath taught me a valuable lesson. Life's not about how you get there, but what you DO to get there. If it's not worth it, then don't bother.Plus, it's super gorey. 9/10 ",43,0,0,0,2,0,1

												I'm not usually one that likes FPS games with no meaning other than to shoot a lot of stuff because it's cool, but the game is actually pretty fun. Got it because a friend recommended it to me. Of course there is a lot of shootin' aliens and that, but you can sometimes pull their eyes out or rip their heads off, which is pretty awesome. Also the game rewards you with 'treasures' if you stray off the usual path. It's probably fun alone, but I personally love playing this with a friend. Also my favorite part?

												Tired of Military shooters?  Bored of the ultra serious garbage that is being spewed out and called FPS games?  Then pick up Serious Sam 3.  It's a fps that is born for old school gamers and doesn't take itself too serious.  While it is not a classic by any standard, it is still better than most of the garbage fps games out there.

												Serious Sam 3: Brain ♥♥♥♥ed Eygptians is by far the most cleverly written political satire to ever grace the human race with it's iridescent presence. In the infinite wisdom from the omniscient immortals at Croteam, the vicious dictatorship of Hosni ""Mental"" Mubarak is expertly represented as a bunch of suicidal members of the Headless Horsemen's Al Qaeda Alien Death Sect, as the relentless try to halt the glorious charge of Arab Spring Sam.  Defining the phrase ""crackling with sexual energy"", Serious Sam 3: Big Fat Erections is the voice of a generation, it answers the call of gamers craving for something more daring, something more extreme, something to make them touch themselves more furiously and gasp gasmically at the mere though of a controller then any overpriced DLC pack ever could. It calls forth a tension that can only be unjustifyingly compared to being unwittingly caught with a stiffy at a pre-school and having to wade through a sea of reasonably horrified soccer moms and teen parents who shower you with fetuses from their unwanted pregnancies. Serious Sam 3: Boobs Feel Erotic was created with the worlds Macho-Powered Graphics engine which produces a plethora of visuals so real, that the animations are toned down by default to spare thy mind of trying to take in two identical realities at once, and any poor Icarus who dares try to fly higher and adjust the settings will be instantly rendered into a coma by the eye-meltingly good graphics that will literally cause them to drown in their own drool. All of this goodness is spliced in with some of the most dramatic character development ever fathomed by a college dropout from some♥♥♥♥♥♥hole in Europe, with Samuel being so overflowing with emotion, determination, wholesome relatability and butt jokes from 2006, that when the game ends their is a 78% chance the player will promptly suicide because they cannot fathom a world in which Cereal Sam is not by their side whilst gently caressing the back of their carpal tunnel riddled wrist.TL;DR It's dumb, cheap, rips off the plot from majora's mask almost as much as I rip off jokes from TBF, and it's got a helluva ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ripper for a final boss.

												The feel of the game is so similar  to the original, with all of the elements that you'd expect of  a Serious Sam game that I immediately felt at home; but with SS3  we get   even better looking, and in some cases,  scarier  looking monsters and  realistic looking weapons as well as fabulous  environments to run and gun around in.If you ever played the first two episodes when they were originally released   and  enjoyed the games because of the tongue in cheek violence, the various ways you could  change the look of the game to show gore,  hippie flower power or a child-like   expression of  blood as well as an over the top hero and waves of monsters, then you won't be  disappointed with  this new offering.  I've been waiting for SS3 to be released for years and am NOT disappointed with the result.  Croteam  have excelled.  There are so many great games being released at the moment, but for  pure unadulterated fun  this is one of the better releases over the last four or five months			",4947,1933,224,565,877,79,758

												Graphically it's nothing great unless ran on max. Voice acting is pretty bad, and Sam sounds like Batman. But I think that on sale this game is totally worth it. Get some players and run this baby. Run over thousands of enemies... or... well... get ran over by thousands of enemies. Either way, it's gonna be worth it. :)			",267,36,9,22,12,5,16

												This game takes a few steps towards modern shooters without taking on their bad habbits. While this game isnt as good as the first two games, it is a worthy addition to the series. The focus on the story has improved, it is no longer hidding within the games encyclopedia. The versus is severely disappointing though.			",235,14,5,31,16,0,44

												Serious Sam 3: BFE is a old-school FPS game developed by Croteam and released in 2011. It is the latest game in the Serious Sam series and a prequel to Serious Sam: The First Encounter. The game's story takes place in the 22nd century, during Mental's invasion of Earth, as implied in The First Encounter. Like previous titles in the series, Serious Sam 3: BFE involves fighting against many hordes of enemies in wide-open environments. However Serious Sam 3 has more closed environments than its predecessors, particularly in the early levels. There are also a larger number of enemies that can attack the player from a distance.Now lets talk about the game shall we. While Serious Sam 3: BFG BFE is clearly a shooter that pays homage to the old-school PC shooters from the late 90's, all the way to 2004 (The end of the golden age of PC FPS games), it holds on to this vision of the past so hard, that it insisted to even bring back the old problems of the genre. While without a doubt this game has some really satisfying gunplay, interesting monster design, where it fall short is the level design, the voice acting, the soundtrack and the story. I know, it's a serious sam game, but they insisted on the story this time around (hence the cut-scenes and dialogue) but it's annoyingly bad. So, so bad. Sam's one-liners are even worse. An old, battered Sam feels like the return of Duke, in Duke Nukem Forever. The charm is just not there. Also, the game barely introduced anything new to the formula, it's just a HD remake of the same old formula, with the exception of a a handful enemy types. Talk about lazy designers. I guess Croteam don't want to traverse into unknown territory. As for the level design, the game starts out decent enough, the engine showcasing detailed buildings lying in ruins, once you get to the 2nd level, the game takes a massive turn to the worse. And there will be a theme repeating here. Once you get to the corridor shooting of Serious Sam 3, you can't turn back. The very thing they wanted to stand apart from, has crawled itself in here aswel. While not all the game is a ""corridor theme"", there are certain areas that will leave you extremely bored, or just unsatisfied. Piramids, ancient temples and such. And when finally you get to the arenas, you will find a tedious experience. Shooting wave after wave of enemies, collecting items and health packs, The fun of it all fades away pretty fast. Which brings me....FUN. Fun is the biggest issue with this game, you have none. This is more of a personal opinion, but honestly, blasting through all those hoards of never ending monters, just felt tedious, instead of fun. Especially in the later levels. It's just not there anymore, I didn't have much satisfaction dying instantly because the game throws dust in my face, and 100 hitscan enemies at once, while I get piled up by skeletons throwing chains at me. It's just infuriating at times, and while the game takes some patience, that patience is not rewarded enough. Secrets consist of small objects such as: mini health packs, armor shards and ammo. Not much if you ask me. The frustration builds up in the later levels when the game thorws enemies that jump all over the place, rockets that hit you with 70% accuracy and suicide bombers everywhere. It's not challenging if you just throw more enemies at once, at least build up a pattern. The last hour of the game will be a real letdown. Anyways, before I give the game a score, I'll just break it down into stuff I liked and disliked.The good:Old school run and gun mechanicsDetailed weapon models + really satisfying to use themDetailed enemy design (and interesting at times)No regenerating health / no cover system (this is a + for me)Fluid melee systemUnlimited sprintHundreds of enemies at once on the screen for you to shootOverall good intentions, but they fall flat because of some of the idiotic design choices.The badBoring level designSubpar voice acting and lame storyWeak supply placement on higher difficutlyOver powered hitscan enemiesShotgun penetration does not exist, as for the rocket launcher, the AOE is a joke.Unsatisfying arenasThe last two hours are utterly frustratingBad endingDead multiplayerIn the end of the day, if you find yourself with this game on a sale, I'd say you should think twice before purchasing this. It's not going to be the ride of your life, the older ones we're way better. Personal rating : 4/10			",166,8,12,16,11,3,15

												(Comming from a Croteam/Serious sam 1 -> 2 fan)This isn't wat serious Sam used to be. The combat has nothing new, graphics-wise it's bland and repetitive and sometimes plain ugly. The game also seems to be missing the fights that made Serious Sam epic, the fights are most of the time in corridors and the outside fights don't seem as big as they used to be.Don't even get me started on the humor, they've recycled the ""waaaaaaaaaaaaaah yourself"" and the new punchlines are cringeworthy.Instead of buying this game, buy The Talos Principle (also from Croteam). ;)			",176,23,10,10,19,1,8

												I have never downloaded a product on steam and haven't had so many issues before STARTING THE GAME. I would review the game and what it offers but sadly I cannot do this as my game will not load and I have tried alot/looking things up in the forums. I must not reccomend this because there are many people who have tech issues with this game. On one of the posts the developers said to temporarily DELETE your anti-virus software to even download or play the game. People should not have to do that and it really says alot about the developers that the people who payed 40$ or less on a game had to try and fix it before even playing the game.MAIN IDEA: There are too many tech issues that do not seem to be fixed and are too much work for a consumer who payed money for the game.Rating: 0/10 I can't rate the game if it doesn't work.Reccomendation: Don't touch this game until the developers can get their stuff together and fix it.

												This game made me nauseous. Apparently it's a widespread problem and you will find a number of players requesting how to turn off camera bobbing. I can't remember, but I think it was setting ""prj_bGameOptionViewBobbing=0"" in the dev console (~ key).The first 2/3rds of the game is just painful to play though. They tried to add some kind of story and gentle intro into shooting cannonballs, and lasers, but they should have just skipped all that junk and got to the shooting cannonballs.The game itself has some pretty good moments near the very end of the campaign mode, but mostly this game just sucks. The problem is they got too serious about graphics and realism, which isn't what made the old Serious Sam games fun. It was just about running around and shooting lots of things really fast with ridiculous guns.There are a few good things to note, such as the destructable objects and envrionment, but mostly playing this was a waste of time for me.Serious Sam 3 BFE just doesn't have a lot going for it.

												It feel like something is missing.  Compared to the previous installments.I remember moments from the other SS games.  The glee.  The bottomless clips without reloading.  The desire to put lots of bullets into anything anywhere.  Dodging incoming bullets.  Huge swarms,SS3 though?  I've spent a significant percentage of my time backpedaling.  And reloading.  And finding cover to not-die and reload.  And those stupid shotgun/rifle zombie have ACTUAL bullets instead of the proper magic missile things, which can't be dodged.  :(  There's swarms, and SOME guns are useful in the REAL fights, but overall, it's too much like the other shooters out there.For instance, the laser gun gets barely any play.  SS3 throws a lot of missile and C4 boxes around, but no infinite-ammo love for anything else.Multiplayer is vastly more sun than single again, though *incredibly* shorter given that all the time spent backpedaling and reloading is gone.I liked the level design of the previous ones, and wonder why a runner can end a map.  What was wrong with arena rooms gated by monster deaths, with a portal to let stragglers in?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Gunplay is  fun, espacially with a friend you will have some hours of fun. Finding new weapons is always motivating and playing around with all of them is a very nice experience. The problem is that there is just nothing to it, the gameplay is sadly very repetetive yet boring. After a few hours this game lost it's point of interest. I played in Coop, i don't wanna know how boring this has to be in singleplayermode ... maybe worth it for 3 Bucks but nothing else.			",53,10,2,6,4,0,3

												Prob one of the worse game i have ever played! Story line is just WTF, after the 3rd level, or stage there is no new enemys. As the game go farther all you get is just more and more spam!! New guns to deal with the spam! SPAM!!!! I ment like no other!!! at least in one stage it tooked me 50 minutes to beat and i have killed thousands!!! ♥♥♥♥ING THOUSANDS!!! ♥♥♥♥ YOU!! Is what i say to the developer! Ok so you have limited ammo but..... the best gun you have to deal with spam is the ♥♥♥♥ing MGs! in game there is 2 weapon's chest that spawns unlimted ammo, and one is Rocket luncher, its ok but not great. One is C4..... WTF??? ♥♥♥♥ING C4!!!! WTF am i supposed to do with C4?! Stick it up your ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥??? WTF were they thinking!!! you get a minigun and you out in ♥♥♥♥ing 2 minutes, but o well you have unlimted C4!!!! ♥♥♥♥!!!! ♥♥♥♥!!!!!! I hate this game so ♥♥♥♥ing much.New Up Date, after a few new steam work shop mods this game is fanilly enjoyable. The mods are awesome from player characters to new weapons, problem is that not alot of people co-ops online. if you fine a few friends, or do split screen. Split screen is actually really cool, this is the first PC game where i actually see a split screen option, all you need is additional keybord and mouse or even a controller. Up to 4 players, i personaly have my 42"" plasma TV as my monitor, any ways i still think with out the work shop its just frusting try to beat the level on hard. -,-			",169,27,5,21,15,3,35

												Pros:-Very pretty graphics (DX11 tessellation looks really cool)-Fast-paced, mindless kill-em-all gameplay-Decently long campaign-Awesome multiplayer-Some decently funny one-liners-Prolonged battles get the metal music goingCONS:-Hideously repetitive tedious chore of a last level-Enemy waves last a liiiiiittle too long (I found myself saying ""Alright, ENOUGH!"" more than a few times)-Stupid idiotic FPS cliches, like losing all your weapons mid-way through the game-Enemies spawn 1-2 at a time, which provides zero challenge, and is nothing more than an exercise in patience. The music switches from calm to energetic about 30 times while this happens, as well-Sound design is HORRIBLE. Enemies that are literally 200 feet away sound like they're right behind you-Enemies can shoot you from the other side of the map with a shotgun-Some extremely annoying enemiesOverall this is an enjoyable game that gets rather annoying in long play sessions. Don't spend more than $10 on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a nice comeback to form from Croteam after disappointing Serious Sam 2.  Graphics are pretty good, music decent with one fantastic track. Story is bad and dumb, but this isn't a game you play for story. It's not as good as First and Second Encounter mainly because of pacing issues and not so good level design. Also, there should be more types of enemies. And Sam has some funny one-liners.7/10			",286,100,6,60,33,1,81

												The game has some flaws, like some enemies being annoying because you can't dodge their bullets, and some weapons needed to reload. These flaws mostly show during the first couple of stages. I also really hated the dark stages. The game gets much better later however and becomes a classic. You start getting weapons that don't need to reload, the enemies become dodgeable, and the game just becomes much more fun. The final stage is awesome too. The graphics are also awesome, though I feel there's a CPU bottleneck. I recommend this. Advice: disable gaussian blur in the graphics options when you play.			",117,9,0,8,4,0,4

												Loud, stupid fast fun, over the top.  Exactly how an action shooter should be.    Much better than the earlier games in the series.  Everything feels good and works right.   Not many complaints other than level design being kinda flat and boxish - most of the excitement comes from suicide bombers running at you from all directions.  Plays very much like a baby of ""Soldier of Fortune 1"" and ""Duke Nukem 3D"" minus the stupid key system.			",441,77,3,28,28,3,28

												I would ONLY recommend it heavily discounted, I got it for 2.49, and for that price, it was a blast.  However, it is only fun in co-op, because the world feels overly lonely without someone to play with.  It's also very short, both the co-op and the (lonely) singleplayer are the same lenth: under a day.  It's age shows, the ""cutscenes"" are like clips of ""The Room"": So bad it's good.  For the couple of hours, this game is fun, but only for those hours.  7/10 (Discounted)  3/10 (Full price)			",79,3,0,5,8,0,1

												Large Open Area NPC Spam 3: BFE:You best enjoy running backwards and shooting while being bum-rushed by a horde of obnoxious monsters, because that's what you'll be doing for about 80% of this game. Hardly any thought seems to have been put into the gameplay.I appreciate the effort to keep alive the traditional FPS style, but this fails to bring much beyond the excessive shooting of repeated enemies. There's some novelty: using a new weapon in the arsenel, encountering a new enemy, fighting a massive boss. The novelty quickly fades. The game is a tedious chore after everything's been thrown at you for the hundredth or even thousandth time. It doesn't matter how destructive the weapons are, or how bizarre the enemies are, when there's little deviation to the scenery, level design and pacing.I'll commend the tech beneath the game, on the other hand. Everything has a good amount of detail visually, and the engine functionally handles a ton of different effects (many of which can be tweaked in the options for optimization). If only more of that effort were put into the actual game...			",62,7,1,2,2,1,0

 ""LINE UP! I'm offering free tickets to HELL""	 Quick Summary	SS3 is a frantic fps game, with a few bugs and some bad level design. It also has some balancing problems, mainly concerning hitscan enemies. Despite these issues, the game is still very fun and I highly recommend picking it up, especially if you enjoy first person shooters. Overview	Serious Sam 3: BFE is a fast-paced first person shooter where you play as Sam ""Serious"" Stone, a badass one-liner spewing hero,  who must fight against legions of aliens in order to save Earth. SS3 is very old-school, meaning that regenerating health is non-existant, levels are huge, wide open areas, and you have a wide variety of huge guns. Story	The story takes place before Serious Sam: The First Encounter (hence the subtitle BFE), earth discovers ancient artifacts in ancient Egypt which make space and time-travel possible. In the future, earth is attacked by aliens, led by an overlord named Mental. The aliens then manage to kill of most of the human race. As a last resort, Sam is chosen to find the Time-lock, an artifact which will allow a single person to travel to a different period of time in history. Gameplay	Sam moves fast, and most of the weapons fire fast too. You get a hold of around 11 weapons, and 2 secret ones. SS3 probably has the most satisfying gameplay of the Serious Sam games, each weapon has a kick to it and feels very powerful. Enemies explode in a shower of blood when killed, gibs flying everywhere. A new feature SS3 has is a melee ability, when pressing E when close to an enemy, you will brutally kill or kick them, depending on what it is you are meleeing. Most of the gameplay consists of you strafing out of the way of projectiles fired by aliens while firing at them. What really sets SS apart from other games is the amount of enemies you go up against. You will find yourself fighting hundreds of enemies per level, in huge arenas. What I don't like	The game has a few glitches, like if you are reloading and you melee an enemy your arm and gun will go into a strange position. While this can be ignored, The awful level design cannot. By far the worst levels in this game are the ones where you are underground in dark caverns with a flashlight. These areas have few enemies other than the annoying space monkeys and you spend most of your time wondering when you would get back to the surface. The first few levels of the game are also pretty bad, to the point where I don't this that this was originally going to be a Serious Sam game, The Cairo levels in particular were really linear and boring. Another issue I have with this game are the hitscan enemies. I can live with the arachnoids, but the technopolips and cloned shotgunners and riflemen were really bad, especially when in large arenas. Overall	Overall, Serious Sam 3 is a really fun game that is so close to being an amazing game. The game is worth it, even at full price. If you have a few friends around and some extra cash to spend, I can't think of a better game to buy and enjoy with them. Verdict: 8/10	 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It’s all about grabbing a gun, gritting your teeth and blasting a path of destruction through invading alien hordes. The levels feel nice and open, and the number of enemies this game seems to be able to manage is simply staggering! At one point in the game, we spent two and a half HOURS with Miniguns shooting the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds that poured towards us. They were falling like flies but  we were constantly driven backwards by the enourmous tide of monsters. The game is superbly balanced and constantly represents a challenge. It’s absolute non-stop chaos from start to finish. If like time to pause in your games to take in the scenery, then this is not the game for you. It’s hilarious, fast paced, and above all else masses and masses of fun. If old style shooters like Doom and Duke Nukem are your thing, then you are going to love this. Recommended? Oh yes! Seriously!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you enjoy egyptian ruins and desert? Do you enjoy massive hordes of annoyingly hard-to-kill enemies? Do you enjoy some of the cheesiest voice acting, complete with one of the dumbest stories ever?Oh boy, have I got the game for YOU!Serious Sam 3 is a very, very, very, very, very stupid shooter. It has large open arenas, lots of enemies to shoot and guns. You can also RIP AND TEAR your enemies with your bare hands, which is ofter far more effective than shooting them, so go figure.I can't even imagine playing this solo, but with a friend to share the misery, the game became mostly bearable. Still, I wouldn't play it again, nor do I plan on wasting money on the DLC.Playtime: 13+ hours (single playthrough)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 7Audio: 7Story: 2Gameplay: 4Overall: 4			",267,75,5,30,35,2,54

												To quote Sam himself: ""WOOOHOO!""I have four accounts on Steam and I got them all for the Christmas bonus DLC a couple of years ago, but also to be able to do the achievements over again. Wrestling Kleers, breaking soldier necks, the Old School achievement, etc, etc. Needless to say I've truly enjoyed this game, despite of quite a few bugs, like switching to last used weapon, which only works in like three out of five times and causes a great amount of unneeded stress in all the mayhem and chaos. I don't know what causes this. This is basically my biggest and probably only gripe about the game, because at times it's a game breaker. Your plans get screwed up and you'll have to try to improvise in a millisecond.Combined, I have played this game almost 450 hours since it was released. That says something, other than the fact I have no life. ._.I started out like a total n00b on Tourist and stayed there embarrassingly long. I mean, it's almost impossible to die, unless you let yourself get totally surrounded by strong monsters, like Kleers, Kamikazes, Khnums or Major Biomechs, and go AFK for a drink or something...I feel like I missed out a lot to not having raised the bar quicker.At the moment, however, I'm enjoying the game on Serious (x56) and I couldn't imagine ever going back to anything easier (except for a few achievements that virtually require a lower difficulty), even if I think I'd never attempt a x84 run. That's just too much and takes more skill than I could dream of.Anyway, I'm rambling I guess. But this game is massively, insanely fun. Some have complained about the lack of story. But it's Serious Sam for crying out loud. Not an epic drama. Sheesh. There are however some moments where the ""momentum"" is killed by having to e.g. deactivate turrets which (at least for me) disorients and disrupts. Not so much fun looking for switches. And there are  hidden doors you need to open with switches as well. Most of them are underground. The parts of such levels are definitely my least favorites, plus they are combined with IMO the most annoying enemies in the game - the cave demons which just hop around erratically as you try to kill them and just move on. Sometimes they even jump to some unreachable area or get stuck. However non-moving enemies are quite common or enemies that gets trapped in the environment so you'll have to waste a lot of time trying to find them and kill them.There's some learning curve to the game, naturally. For me it was learning how to effectively use the most popular weapon in the game, the mutilator, It can also be used for more than just killing enemies and destroying stuff. It's a fact that the mutilator can kill enemies a lot faster than for example the minigun and the XL2 laser gun, if you play on normal and above (enemies have the same HP on normal as on e.g. serious).Another big challenge with the game is learning which enemies spawn at what point and where, and in what order. I haven't felt I have the capacity to learn this for the bigger levels and grand fights, but it's possible and makes your life so much easier. Still, I guess my favorite parts of the game is when you're about to deal with a ""war ship"" that can basically spawn enemies endlessly unless you deal with the ship itself and get out of the mess it can create. You can control the chaos. If you want to, that is. :)So yeah this is a great game which you should add to your libr-- AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!			",47,1,0,0,0,0,3

												Unfortunately I can't reccomend this game.Lack of ammoBoring locationsEasy to get lostBoring weaponsAnnoying unneccessary puzzlesI've tried to love this game several times. No way.I like first two parts and the second part of SS franchise. Gameplay was much funnier, levels were more varied, guns were funnier. DIVERSITY - that's the key. In general I like an idea to bring realistic weapon into the SS universe, but it doesn't work in this game as it should.			",498,45,22,61,38,2,63

												A weak attemp to make Serious Sam relevant again. After Serious Sam 2 which i loved, people complained that it wasnt like the first game so this is what we get. The same game as the first but alot more linear and dull. The first one had its charm, the second one had good variety but this one has nothing tha stands out. They didnt even try to improve the game after so many years. Play the HD remakes or SS2 instead!			",289,87,6,51,22,2,44

												Absolutely amazing. I can't ask much more from a Serious Sam revival. The engine and interface are beautifully crafted and the enemies and details ooze realism. Usually game revivals fall flat but Serious Sam 3 BFE goes above and beyond! The next gen shooter mechanics such as sprint and true ADS, are integrated very well into the old school gameplay that the serious sam series is known for. I knew it was going to be good, I didn't realise just how good until I started playing.			",672,117,7,51,43,6,74

												For anyone looking for a good classic FPS experience, this is it. No cover or regenerating health, just you, hordes of aliens, and a ton of health packs and huge satisfying weapons along the way. Anybody who grew up with or prefer more traditional FPS games is going to enjoy this a lot. It looks great, it feels and plays great, and running n' gunning through the strewn entrails of your extra-terrestrial adversaries has never felt better.Needless to say, this is the kind of shooter many of us have been waiting for, it's the kind of revival Duke Nukem Forever wished it was, it's the gore and explosion filled kind of shooter we all loved as children, and it's a kind of game we can only hope for more of. Developers take note: less cowering behind cover. More sledgehammers.			",246,25,10,11,26,1,36

The cheats also add longevity to the game, adding fun ways to replay missions. Some people might enjoy the cheesy characters, but it wasn't particularly funny for me. I'd recommend waiting and getting this on sale. Whatever you do, you can spend a few fun hours killing aliens, which is always good.			",270,51,5,35,34,2,60

												I haven't really played for a long time, but from what I've played so far, it's incredibly fun. There's a cartoony, bloody, arcade machine style humor and sense of awareness that other games strive for, but end up creating a cheesy shadow of. It invokes the coin eaters of days gone by, with the easy logic employed in its difficulty level, and the scale of difficulty in levels. It's a video game lovers video game. This is no pseudo intellectual ""Gone Home"" level crap, this is a video game that wants to be fun, first and foremost; in short, it wants to be a video game worth playing. It's polished, and the shooting and gameplay mechanics are so well done, that it's impossible to get mad at it, even if you find yourself stuck on a part. I'd recommend this at any price for people who love to play games, and enjoy them as games.			",302,31,6,22,13,1,31

												Looks really good on ultra in 1080p and it's extremely smooth since it never seems to drop below 60FPS.This is what First Person Shooters are suppose to be like. Just run around, find alot of funny and usefull items, blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, kill everything you see, have extremely deep backpockets that can fit Rocket Launchers, Miniguns, Shotguns and a ♥♥♥♥ton of ammo. No realism needed. The jokes are funny, the game is beautiful, frame rate is really high and itäs such a relif to see that people still enjoys classic FPS games such as DooM and Quake and Painkiller and ofcource the old Serious Sam games.If you're not a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing frat boy that just thinks that Call of Duty and Battlefield are the only games that exists, buy this game....

												Hi, just in short, I'm not that big fan of the shooter massacre games, but to tell you the truth it was good. Singleplayer was awsome the first time, the 2nd time it was okay. Multiplayer a little bit dead, but that 9/10 Co-op awsome! ""What's better than one Sam? MORE SAM!!!""   Gameplay 8   Story 6   Graphics 7   Sound 6   Replay Value 8   My Score 7 The table score in 10.  I would offer this game If you have extra money. :)I stopped at 69% achievements, wanted 100% but it's perfect, if you know what I mean...:D			",188,19,19,16,18,1,7

												I haven't really played for a long time, but from what I've played so far, it's incredibly fun. There's a cartoony, bloody, arcade machine style humor and sense of awareness that other games strive for, but end up creating a cheesy shadow of. It invokes the coin eaters of days gone by, with the easy logic employed in its difficulty level, and the scale of difficulty in levels. It's a video game lovers video game. This is no pseudo intellectual ""Gone Home"" level crap, this is a video game that wants to be fun, first and foremost; in short, it wants to be a video game worth playing. It's polished, and the shooting and gameplay mechanics are so well done, that it's impossible to get mad at it, even if you find yourself stuck on a part. I'd recommend this at any price for people who love to play games, and enjoy them as games.			",302,31,6,22,13,1,31

No realism needed.

Atomic Penguin's Tasty Recipe for Amazing Local Co-op Fun!!Ingredients:Pick almost any Serious Sam game (SS3:BFE recommended, but any version works equally well)RL friends, preferably all in the same roomCopious amounts of your group's favorite beverages & snacks (caffeine optional)Directions:Start gameAdd in Friends in local co-opSettle dispute over who gets to be Groovy GregoryStirLet sit 2-4 hoursMix in beverages and Snacks as neededThis recipe has been in my family for years. We use this regularly because we all enjoy it so much. I suggest at least once per month, though you can enjoy it more often if your group chooses to.This is so easy and has so much flavor! Yummy Rocket Launching Goodness!! Honestly, there's nothing else like it. Bon Appétit.*Seriously, this game has no flaws. It's non-stop action at it's mindless best. Get it for everyone in your family, even if they don't usually play games. Fire it up, make the server private, get everyone in the game, and let the good times roll.			",289,61,0,75,34,2,76

I wanted SAM and i got my Serious fix with this game. It still has EVERYTHING i loved about the game and added a few new things i like even more.

												Lets be straight, im doing this for the holliday gift item.. But while im doing it i may as well give a brief review: Its ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.Serious sam is what doom3 should have been, and wants to be. Heres the gameplay - You have a gun, you have a hoard of♥♥♥♥♥♥running towards you, you need to kill everything. Simple. This game doesn't need to ♥♥♥♥ around with perks, sweeping naratives,  cover based shooting, hell even cover itself. This is straight up old school FPS at its absoulete best. Be prepared to bust out circle strafes and rocket spam to the max as♥♥♥♥♥♥will literally be hitting fans... and walls, floors, faces, etc.It turns out i cant write as much as i would actually like to due to a character limit, so let me just say this. If you like old school FPS. If you like the feeling of being up♥♥♥♥♥♥creek with only a rocket launcher as a paddle, you'll love Serious Sam 3			",639,103,25,42,36,2,64

												I came I to this game with high hope. I'll just get this out there right in the open... this game is not worth what it costs. Sorry but it's true.Secondly I gotta be honest when I say I got bored really really fast and if you see I've only racked up about 2 hours max and I'm bored ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I should probably give it a real go and I'm not gonna say it's♥♥♥♥♥♥based on my time played  it I rarely lose interest so fast. I got this game on special for 4 bucks but retailing normally at 50+ dollars I'd just wait till a sale if I was you.I do think if you've played the previous games you can appreciate that the idea is just to kill kill kill, but if you're new to the series don't come in to it expecting any real objectives. Pros: Kill kill killGoreBloodFunnyLooks to be in keeping with the old games we grew up with.Cons.The bloody price!			",15,0,0,0,0,0,1
