												I've heard that Homefront was the most over-advertised and under-purchased games of its time and that's probably true. It has some brilliant cinematography moments, a solid shooting engine, good storyline, and decent voice acting. I enjoyed every minute I spent playing it and will probably return to do another playthrough later. Good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Homefront is an FPS which tells the story of a resistance movement fighting back against a near future Korean occupation of the USA.The game play is a very generic FPS. Pretty much identical to Call of Duty and Medal of Honor; you can only carry two weapons,  and four grenades. You will have to swap to different weapons from dead enemies throughout each level as finding ammo is more difficult than you would imagine. None of the enemies use the same weapon...Graphics wise, it looks nice, but you can tell the game was released in 2011, it looks better than most games released, however it shows it's age when comparing it to more recent titles. The graphical options are wide and you can probably play this game on a potato if you really wanted.All the maps in the single player are very well designed, sadly you can't really explore because you are constantly reminded to keep following your squad leader. You fight through various different environments such as the streets of suburbs, department stores, and baseball fields, all of which show a disturbing outcome of the quite scary ""what if?"" scenario from a Korean invasion.The single player of Homefront will take about five hours to complete; this is pretty short in my opinion, and the game ends on a massive cliff hanger, I would of liked to have seen another two or three more missions to tire up the loose ends in the story.  Multiplayer is still very much alive in Homefront, I have only played in a couple of games but I had no problem finding a map full of people to jump into. A lot of the reviews you will read on here will say multiplayer is the strongest aspect of the game, so they can't all be wrong. I would like to recommend Homefront; however I would wait till it is on sale, it has recently been on sale a few weeks ago for as low as £3,75, which would be an absolute bargain if you could get it for that again in an up coming sale.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Set in the year 2027, Homefront presents a kind of ""worst case scenario"" of the near future. Kim Jong-Il has died and has been succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-Un. After unifying North and South Korea, and forming the Greater Korean Republic, Kim Jong-Un begins annexing nearby countries, such as Japan and Vietnam. At the same time, America's economy lies in shambles due to their dependence on foreign oil. After a satellite-launched EMP blast, Korea finally invades America.In the single player campaign, you play as Robert Jacobs, a former helicopter pilot who is being recruited for ""re-education"" by the Koreans. But pilots have become scarce in occupied America, and the resistance fighters need one for an important mission. Luckily, it doesn't take them long to liberate you from your Korean captors.The gameplay is fast-paced and exhilarating throughout the campaign. The shooting feels incredibly tight and powerful, and is extremely satisfying. Honestly, I don't remember the last time it felt this good to shoot someone in the face. The AI, for both squad mates and enemies, is outstanding. Your squad mates are able to hold their own in a firefight, and even saved my life on more than one occasion. And your enemies provide a fitting challenge without it feeling like they're cheating. For instance, enemies don't automatically know where you are (like in some shooters) making for some pretty awesome ambush scenarios.As a member of the Resistance, you're almost always outmanned and outgunned, meaning that hit-and-run guerilla tactics are preferred over head-on assaults. And even though you're only a lowly member of the Resistance, you still get some neat toys to play with once and a while, such as the Goliath: a six-wheeled tank-like vehicle that destroys enemies that you mark with a targeting device. You also get to man the gun of a humvee and fly a helicopter over the course of the campaign.The only problem with the campaign is that it is over far too quickly. Consisting of seven missions, it only takes few hours to finish the campaign on normal difficulty.Once you're finished with the campaign, you can always jump into the multiplayer. The online multiplayer in Homefront is almost an exact copy of Call of Duty's online offerings. There are six different classes, such as ""Assault"" and ""Sniper,"" that can be customized and renamed. As you gain experience and level up, you unlock new perks and weapons. Up to 32 players can play in a match, and most of the maps are of the suburban variety.Graphically, Homefront is solid. Environments are well-detailed, and help set the tone of an occupied America. Some textures, like the wood grain in a hardwood floor, look absolutely stunning. But shadows sometimes look a little low res, and character models can look sketchy at times. But even if Homefront had the greatest graphics in the world, they would still pale in comparison to the phenomenal sound design. The voice acting is spot-on, and the incredible soundtrack sets the mood perfectly throughout the entire campaign.If you're the kind of gamer that values quality over quantity, then you'll definitely want to check out Homefront.

												Right now, this Homefront is right where it belongs. Mixed reviews, dropped price (sales up to 90% recommended)... And yet, it's not all that bad.As a straight-forward shooter with a rather short singleplayer campaign and not-so-bright multiplayer, it's not worth much. I don't like Call of Duty series, but this game generally worse at gameplay than Infinity Ward games, and somewhere on the level of Treyarch jobbing. Don't believe to those who're saying that there's only 3 hours of gameplay. That comes from people who are playing at easy difficulty. Yeah, the AI is not the brightest bulb in garland, yet the overall challenge is quite fair, weaponry is nice and overall impression from shootouts is decent enough - if we're not going into ballistics and bullet piercing effects.The controls are generally good (except vehicles). The visuals are not bad, on the level with CoD, again. Nothing too fancy, though. The overall viewing angle a bit too small, like we wear an assault helmet - but it is not so! Levels aren't really large, and even when they are - the path is usually quite narrow. Bugs... exists, but not overwhelming. I remember only one rage-producing moment, when I dropped hostile glow hawk, and then trigger moving at place where I was some Bradley or whatever, and sending me to restart point. That's bad, yeah, but not really game-breaking. The engine is quite stabile, no crushes, no any big troubles that can't be fixed with reload.Multiplayer part is not dead - servers (mostly) working, some people are running around and killing each other... usual stuff. I liked the idea that the more kills you perform, the more clear to opposite team your exact position. That's making cheaters more noticable to others - however, they're still a trouble to fairplay, admins aren't really any good at moment. Overall - multiplayer there is dull and down-sized version of Battlefield 3, so - no, not recommended for MP, without your own team especially.What I really like about the Homefront - is of amount of backstage work. Of course, it's all quite naive and, as always, made by people who are very far from real warfare business... But still, they're showing quite nasty and somewhat realistic picture of the former ""United States of America"", being rounded up and bended by hunger, lack of fuel, the inhumanity of the former citizens, and much more brutality on the part of the mighty Korean warriors. Basically, the story tells that just right after the USA dropped the flag of the world's №1 oppressor, due to financial problems, they got it all back. Right from 18th century (""The only good American is a dead American""), and particularly, for the US oppressive war of 1950-1953. Yeah, united Koreans, managed to best the US, using their own tactics and arsenal. It supposed to be ironical, but in fact turns out way too pathetic. The aftertaste of this story is even worse than in case of Spec Ops the Line... not so strong and bitter, however. That's just a visualized horror of ""oh, God, what if the world will do to US the same thing we're doing to them now? Like in Iraq, Afgan, Libya etc..."" Well, I am more believe in scenario like in the ""Invasion day"" 2013 movie - where Americans themselves selling all and everything out. And still - good scenario and background work. Videogames are really objects of art, and as one of them - Homefront deserves your brief look. Standard-issue FPS with good guns and story of bended US, spitting in the face of invaders... Worth 6.5 points from me (out of usual 10).			",725,238,45,156,102,5,232

This isn't Advanced Warfare (Well...it's set in 2027)This isn't Modern Warfare (Ok, it kind of is) This is Guerilla Warfare. Homefront tells a story that not many other FPS games have told. Many games like to show the U.S. as ""the undefeatable force"" and the ""people who always save the day in the end"". In this game, you get to experience the opposite. What would happen if North Korea were to occupy America? Answer: It's not pretty. CAMPAIGNNorth Korea has occupied America. You play as Robert Jabcobs, a pilot in the army. You are part of the Resistance, a small army trying to fight against the KPA (Korean People's Army). Along your journey, you will see the horrors of this alternate future and experience a different  gameplay style of a shooter game. The story to me is good, nothing amazing, but simply good. the characters are memorable and have their distinct personalities. Guerilla warfare is  something that this game introduces. Usually when you play titles like Call of Duty and  Battlefield (lets just use those titles as an example), these games usually want you to be an explosive and ammo grinding hero. This is somewhat the opposite in Homefront. Throughout the game, you will be performing hit-and-run raids and surprise attacks. Also, for each gun you pick up, you might only find one magazine and the maximum ammo you can carry for most weapons will be lower than 100. Instead of spraying like John Rambo, you gotta aim  carefully like a skilled Marksman. The campaign is about 5-6 hours long for me on Xbox 360.MULTIPLAYERI haven't spent much time playing multiplayer, but there is still a small and dedicated community playing. Multiplayer has the typical customization that most modern FPS multiplayer games have. The multiplayer feels like a hybrid of Battlefield and Call of Duty if you ask me. However, with that being said, I wouldn't recommend buying Homefront for the multiplayer since the player count is less than 200, but if you really want to play Homefront for the multiplayer then by all means go ahead.My Own OpinionI'm one of those people who have been interested in Homefront ever since it came out in 2011.The story is one that I still find amusing and I spent time playing it on Xbox 360 (when it still worked).Should you buy it?I would say wait for a sale, then pick it up. It's not the best game in the world, but it has something different to offer.- Psychii			",88,14,4,9,6,1,0

												To be honest you will like this game more if you prefer story over gameplay.The story is good as you take on the role of a ressistance fighter who must work with other Americans who come from all walks of life to fight the North Korean occupation. It has a lot of deep and though provoking moments. However be warned as there are also many disturbing moments that will stun you and test your emotions.Gameplay however its basically a Call of Duty knock-off only without the fastpaced action while the movment feels slow. It could have been a lot more given its story and themes.			",121,5,0,10,1,0,4

												I played this game on console and thought it was OK. I bought it in a bundle and thought the game was much better with a keyboard and mouse but way to short. When the game ends it feels like it is just getting good. It is very interesting playing a game where America has already been invaded, and parts of the game are very brutal and shocking. While I feel the game is too short (another level or 2 would have been perfect) if you can find this game on sale, it worth playing it for single player. There are bugs, multiplayer is dead, and too short. 7/10			",231,26,8,29,23,2,47

												STORYThe story, at least at the beginning, is promising and just about close enough to current affairs to have you interested. However, the game is far too forceful with the ""oo look how terrible war is"" feeling, which seems to be self-defeating: instead of being subtly led into any sort of realisation/agreement, you just feel like you're constantly being struck by a moral hammer that ends up being incredibly annoying but otherwise ineffective.The characters are also less than compelling. Perhaps having more time in the story might help (see note below on playtime).GAMEPLAYThe gameplay itself is ok but I remember the odd restrictions in movement popping up (having to take a specific path rather than being able to jump over certain things was limiting for the gamer who decides to mash every button to get round an obstacle!). For some reason, the game dynamics/enemies/tools etc. felt a bit like those in Dishonored (which isn't a bad thing): weird and also quite enjoyable.GRAPHICSNot bad at all, can't complain.PLAYTIMEI think I spent about 4 hours completing this game on the hardest setting and I'm not a super skilled gamer. A first person shooter should take at least twice this time to complete!SUMMARYGood gameplay and concept, lacking in story and playtime. Probably only buy if you're bored and the price looks favourable...			",57,5,0,3,8,0,5

A decent title game a campaign that doesn't meet expectations, but with a great and unique multiplayer mode. Homefront is certainly one of the most unique shooters I’ve ever played, driven by an ingenious and surprisingly well-fleshed out plot and a dark and dreary, realistic setting. But it also controls and feels like a typical shooter, looks like a game that’s several years old, and most importantly, has an inexcusably brief campaign. Multiplayer is Homefront’s redeeming quality, and those gamers out there who are like me and swoon for alternate/future history settings should certainly look into it. However, if what you’re seeking is an upper-echelon shooter, keep looking, because Homefront isn’t what you’re searching for.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												An intense but short single player campaign plus an addictive multiplayer mode helped make Homefront the first true alternative to the repetitive Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises.  With drones, vehicles and a range of creative 'infantry abilities' combined with an innovative 'battle points' system, the competitive multiplayer mode in Homefront is truly outstanding.Add this one to your catalog!

I don't feel that the story held up to the premise that it set forth at the begining but not bad. If you can pick this up on the cheap (and you usually can) it isn't the worst way to spend a couple hours. I am giving it a thumbs up, but again, I suggest getting it in the $5 or less range.

												This satisfies my patriotism fetish more than you can possibly understand. Nonetheless, it's a somewhat dissappointing game. Much of the story felt as if it could have had real, tear-jerking moments, yet the elements are never explored. I think the largest reason for this is how rushed the game feels.Don't get me wrong, it plays adequately and looks great. Nonetheless, something about the pacing of the campaign just feels...off. Too much happens too quickly. The protagonist goes from a ""military grunt nobody who happens to be handy with a gun"" to ""lord of war who causes the earth to tremble as he breathes in one's general direction"" within an in-game week. I had hope for this game. I really did. When I saw a child's parents executed in front of him, and when I hid amidst dozens of murdered corpses within a mass grave to hide from communist invaders, I thought, ""Maybe this game won't just be another lifeless virtual duck-hunt."" Unfortunately, I was wrong. I'd much rather the game follow a more humble storyline instead of going for huge ""emotional"" moments and executing them poorly. Your character is a resitance member. Why not have him act as one? Why not have him smuggle objects, firebomb cars, and raid checkpoints? I was hoping for a game that would convey how Red Dawn (1980s) felt. It very obviously tried to pander to the ""MURICA"" crowd, which is why I bought it. Even from a totally biased point of view, I think this game fails at what it tried to achieve. A lot of work obviously went into it, yet, the campaign feels like it was rushed out.I got it on sale for 4.99. That's all I can recommend it for.			",139,17,0,7,5,0,0

I wanted to shoot every one of them and get on with it on my own.Now a setting like this, no matter the silliness of it all, merged with open world and S.T.A.L.K.E.R quality shooting and atmosphere - that could be something!Homefront has some rather good production values.

												If you can get this game for less than $5 it may be worth it, but for a campaign that lasted just under 3 and a half hours, and a dead multiplayer, this is way overpriced. Gona have to give it a thumbs down.			",862,251,11,98,69,3,103

												Game can be done in about 2 hours and 30mins.  But the game is fun in my opinion. Enemy Ai are hard to fight even on easy! Story was pretty good along with the cutscenes. This game does predict the future with North Korea and the strangest thing is that it predicted Kim Jong-il is deceased and his son Kim Jong-Un is now in charge! After playing this game i looked into North Korea and this game predicted a lot of events.ProsGet to kill Koreans!!Online Multiplayer still aliveVoice acting is pretty goodEnvironment is done nicely and well doneGraphics are okayEnemy Ai are smartHooters and white castle are in the game!!ConsGame is short			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												(I’m not a huge fan of first person shooter games in general so keep that in mind when reading this review)Okay, first off, this game is WAY too short. The campaign took me only 4 hours to complete on normal difficulty (even with me dying and re-spawning every few minutes)  If you are going to charge $20 for a game, make it a bit longer than 4 hours.	Despite having a short campaign, I had a lot of fun playing this game.  It has a wide variety of fun to use assault rifles, submachine guns, sniper rifles, and not to mention goliath-the resistances armored vehicle that you control with a targeter.	The graphics are sub-par even for a game made in 2011.  On many cases I had to lean closer to my monitor to see if it was an enemy I was aiming at or just a stray piece of garbage.	I have nothing to say about the multiplayer mode as I have not played it but I might update my review after I have played it.	Regardless of the short story and the lacking visuals, I enjoyed this game, but I wouldn’t buy it until it goes on sale or the price goes down.  However if you are looking for a fun first person shooter game that won’t kill your computer, Homefront is a very good option	I give this game a respectable 7/10.			",105,9,4,4,6,0,3

												The positives of this game are that I enjoyed the environment and the way it looks. The weapons especially looked very pretty. I particularly enjoyed the setting of the last chapter. Unfortunately, that's about as good as it got. From start to finish, the single player campaign is a whopping 4.5hrs.  The weapons that are dotted around the environment are quite hard to spot. There's no subtle highlighting or anything. The only time I knew there was a weapon was because I happened to have walked over it, bringing up the option to switch to it.It's quite linear in the way that it plays, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I didn't enjoy it in this game. The storyline is okay, but nothing compelling. The overall feeling of the gameplay just felt awkward. All in all, definitely not a game to purchase at full price and even discounted it, I'd be wary.			",129,8,2,9,7,0,27

												I must say that I actually enjoyed this game. However, I cant simply recommend it. The campaign is PAINFULLY short. My first playthrough on the default difficulty only took 3 hours and I was in no rush. This is inexcusable. If you find it for $5 or less, pick it up. Other than that don't bother. I must say that the game was good enough to make me very curious about what Crytek will end up doing with the sequel.			",347,53,9,49,18,1,35

												Story is a bit on the unbelievable side of things. While Homefront is inspired by the original Red Dawn, this is less of a ""realistic"" attempt at portraying an American insurgency against foreign invaders, jingoistic delight though the film may have been. I'd have preferred a more thoughtful, slow-moving, tactical campaign but Homefront's run-n-gun supersoldiering around can be fun. Despite its flaws Homefront is an entertaining game that tried to be different from the standard modern shooter story. The combat is satisfying and challenging on higher difficulties. Weapons look neat. Multiplayer is actually enjoyable, when you can find a match.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now I see why people didn't really like Homefront. Don't get me wrong, it's NOT a bad game, but it's a disappointing one, especially when you see how much THQ advertised and promoted this game. So what's brought this game down? The singleplayer. First, it's awefully short; you can beat it in 4 hours. But the story, wow, there's such a cool background and the characters are totally relatable. And that's what annoyed me the most. It has such a good premise that you wonder why isn't it any longer. And the gameplay. It's like a typical military shooter. The problem is that it holds your hand WAY TOO MUCH. For example, you'll have to take out certain enemies, and there's an icon on it saying ""SHOOT"". Well, what else would I do? Blow a kiss to it? The problems of the singleplayer outweighed it's benefits. Multiplayer fares better. The PC servers are still up, and there's at least one full server on afternoons. It's like a combination of Battlefield and COD. You can use points in-game to purchase things like armor and even vehicles. Maps are quite good too. Ground Control, the main mode, has you capturing certain points, like Domination in Battlefield, only that you can move up to a certain area if one team dominates it, like in the Rush mode in Battlefield. In summary, Homefront is full-priced game with budget-game quality. Buy it when it's on sale.			",60,0,1,1,6,0,5

												Standard Mediocre Modern Military Shooty bang-bangGo here, kill the badguys, wait for AI to open door, find a new gun, rinse and repeat.Story; eh. It's warporn.  ""oh look at what the enemy is doing, go kill them.-- ok, now go and kill the enemy for killing your people for killing their people.""- Hardly remember anything really. Really short 4-5 hour campaign... Shame.Visuals; Eh. It's something. Ran alright but a few really disgusting textures. Satisfying explosions though.Nice world; captures horrors of war nicely... a little over-the-top at times...Didn't have too many problems playing. - Speeding through a section too fast would make the AI derp out preventing access to the next section; move backwards, then towards next location. (twice in a playthrough)- Got stuck on a lot of junk. chairs, clothing lines, rubble. Rather annoying. Also annoying when you try to move back or to the side behind cover only to be blocked by one of the AI...Slightly disappointed, but still enjoyed playing.  Not a bad game, just short and repetitive.Played the game twice; First blind on normal, second on hardest difficulty. Multi-player; Yet to try.			",901,238,33,90,72,9,119

Home is where the game isLet's start of by saying what I need to say about Homefront. Homefront is an unbalanced and a bit rough game that feels unfinished. And that's the main problem me, and many, others had with this game. It sounds a bit silly recommending a game after starting the review with negative things. Why would I recommend this game then? Why should you buy this game then?The first thing that comes to my mind about Homefront is an abandoned puppy, left with no food, no shelter and left alone in a calm understanding of failure in it's head. You can still see the hope, the brief moment of love it got in it's eyes. If you can open your heart to the sad and helpless Homefront you are treated with a pretty mediocre yet fun FPS experience.Homefront does a lot of things wrong. But at the same time Homefront does things right. Well, mostly a thing or two. Homefront is a really really mediocre game. It doesn't have any magnificient plot. It doesn't have original, revolutionary gameplay mechanics. But it does have style. And that's enough to cover the worse things with the game behind a well designed and stylized environment.Homefront deserves a spot of some sort among the FPS genre. It's nothing great. And part of it may be in the way developers treated the game. You can see the partial laziness and the lack of trust on their product made them lose interest in the game and went with the basic idea of every FPS game nowadays; ""Let's make another one of these"" was their motivation to even make Homefront.Homefront is certainly worth buying if you are in need of a short yet stylized single-player FPS game. Even with it's mediocre gameplay it still manages to entertain for hours with it's challenging Achievements.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

Posted: May 28, 2013
												Let me first try to explain why it was that I wanted to play Homefront.  Firstly it was the first game that I could remember that brought the fight to American soil and wasn't based on factual past battles or wars.  Here was a new idea, a new war as it were, and it was America defending its land.  Rather than America attacking on someone else’s, which is all too often the case.  The second reason was that the story they chose seems almost feasible.  The “Future History” trailer that was released told a great story that felt like it could happen.  It was a great mix of a new idea in uncharted territory with a hint of possibility.The first thing that I noticed was the graphics, they were gorgeous.  I spend so much time playing older games that I am, for all intents and purposes, a few years behind on the graphics.  This games not that much different since its already a year and a half old.  The game started with my being taken from my home and placed on a bus to an unknown destination.  The drive down the street was eye opening to the world I had entered.  It was some time after the Korean occupation and everything was about what you would expect.  There were some moments that I thought were funny, and others that I knew were there just for my shock value.It was shortly after that moment that I had fully removed the rose tinted glasses.  I came back to the game the next day, after playing for about a hour the previous night.  This time all bets were off and everything was on the table.Cut to four hours later as I watched the ending credits scroll up my screen using all of my will not to drop a huge F-bomb in front of my child.Terrible, simply horrid and a waste of my time.  I have so many other games I could have spent that time with.  And to have the single player of a game that originally was retailing at $49.99 is ridiculous.  Even its current price of $9.99 seems a bit much for the size of its single player.  It took me longer to beat the first Portal that it did Homefront.Nothing about Homefront stands out above the crowd, hell nothing about it outside its story is unique in any way.  I remember reading once that Homefront was inspired by Half-Life 2, and its guerrilla warfare.  Its clear that it was simply a handful of moments in the later moments of the game and nothing else from Half-Life 2.  Especially nothing about its ground breaking story, graphics, anything.  That’s about the same as saying that Bust-a-Move was inspired by Pong.  In other words, they say they are inspired by an already well known great game and hope more people will buy their game.There was also mention of using real companies and logos in the locations.  It was stated to give it the real feel of these locations.  I guess this is true, but I saw it more as; “Lets stick some advertising into the game to make more money!”There was a moment where I realized that I hadn’t seen any health, and in fact had no clue how much I had.  There was no HUD element with health nor had I seen any heath packs or med kits, not even a single bottle of pills.  It was after this realization that I noticed that as I would take damage the HUD would kind of darken, and once I took cover and stopped getting hit the screen would normalize.  Ah regenerative healing.  I don’t know how I feel about this, but on first use I’m not a fan.  Maybe its just Homefront, but it seems like it made the game too easy.  The only weapon I was even remotely concerned with was rocket launchers.{SPOILERS]The overall story was acceptable, but left much to be desired.  There were parts however that I found annoying and unexplained.  For example there is a level where you have to sneak into this outpost/base thing controlled by a bunch of crazy survivalist.  When we arrive the other members of  my party make mention that they don’t know these people but one member of the party did, but he’s now dead.  The crazy survivalist turn on us, what a surprise, and we have to sneak into the place and steal their helicopter.  Now once this part happens we head to the church to steal the copter.  But how the hell does this Connor♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥even know here the church is?  When the level starts he states he’s never been here, and now he knows his way around?  I call bull.Another thing, again with the great Connor, was at the end of the game.  First we ignore the fact that the US Army let use join them on their attack of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Because I refuse to believe that part.  But then, right before the last climactic moments of battle, this Connor idiot gives a little speech and ORDERS THE SOLDIERS AROUND.  Seriously, this guy is telling the army guys what to do.  By this point I had pretty much given up on the game, but when that happened I knew right then and there.  I knew that once I was done, I wouldn't be playing it again.To make things worse, the whole game you are being yelled at to do this, do that, go here, shoot him.  Just constantly being told what to do, and that gets real old, real quick.  And maybe coming off a game like Far Cry 2 has me a little skewed in my views/opinions.  But I can’t remember any other FPS that was similar to this.  This game is a rail short of being a rail-shooter.  Its really that poorly made, its really that bad.The story has no real ending.  And to make things worse, the guy that annoyed the crap out of me since the beginning of the game martyrs himself at the end.  Yea, Connor, that idiot.  I was more than happy to hit him with that air strike, but it was a really stupid moment overall.  Because why would they need a guy on the ground to use a laptop to fire an airstrike from a helicopter doing circles over the bridge target?  Why?And all the cliches where present in Homefront.  The story was pretty predictable on a few occasions, and at times the sheer number of Korean soldiers was just laughable.  Possibly the worst TF2 trade I’ve ever made, and I seriously doubt that I will ever touch that game again.			",379,53,20,28,68,7,68

HomefrontOverall Score: 5.5/10Short Summary:The storyline in this game is basic - Year is 2027 (2 years after Korean-American war), Korean military troops plan to occupy thecity. A group of american resistance fighters join togather in order to eliminate all Korean troops and retake the city.Estimated gameplay hours: 4-6.Pros & Cons:+Storyline - I guess the storyline kept me playing this game until the end to see what will happen.+Missions - I would give a positive point for the missions. [helicopter / sniping / destroying vehicles & other].-Gameplay - Basic FPS shooter really didn't find anything that made me play this game with excitement.-Graphics - The game looks alive and the atmosphere & surroundings suits well with the storyline, but can't ignore how bad the game is optimized.-Acting & Sound - Zero feel for the characters (mumbling characters), but if the game was remastered for example, it could've been different.-Animations - Not good both for enemy a.i and characters (allies / npc).Enjoyment: (6/10) - Lack of fun in killing enemies.Repetetive: (4/10)Replayability (0/10) - Hell no.Frustraiton (5/10) - Dialogue between the characters.Boredom (2/10) - Action didn't stop I would give them that.Conclusion:I expected a better experience from this game (I can say it's the opposite of Medal Of Honor in terms of graphics, gameplay execution and the feeling it gives you while playing it).I would say better skip this game and play Homefront Revolution, but I do recommend this game on sale if you want to give it a go or well, if you have some extra time to play a medicore fps military game.Overall Score: 5.5/10* Skip it.** Not Recommended.*** Give It A Try.**** Recommended On Sale.****** Recommended On Full Price.

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. And since I'm sure you see alot of that in reviews let me at least explain why.I did play this game back on xbox and when I saw it for dirt cheap I got pretty excited because in my foggy memory I remember having a bit of fun on this game and kept thinking to myself that it was just  a demo I played somewhere since it didn't seem like I had played to much into before I had to end, so of course I wanted to play it again/full game.Apparently the ""demo"" I thought I had played was actually the full game. Don't believe me? Look at my playtime and achievements, I already beat it (more on this later).I don't want to rip this game a new hole because in honesty there are good points.+Tons of weapons! When you start fighting hordes of enemies there could be ranging from 2 different guns to about 15 which allow unique firefights.+Great story line (We'll look more at this later.) I love ""alternate universe"" storylines where what-if's become the ""this actually happened"". Its really neat because it throws you into a world you don't recognize and forces you to try to grasp at things that just aren't there anymore.+Achievements! yay! (this is a personal preference in games. I like working towards something extra in games, not really a necessity for buying this game...)So yeah some things were good, but throughout the game I found myself frusterated with it. Things I don't remember being frusterated with when I played it on xbox.Why? Well, simply put, this game is not optimized for pc. Yesyes #pcmasterrace whatever, but this game was made for consoles like the xbox and ps, that is obvious. Keybindings are weird, moving and looking obviously needed a controller, aiming/shooting/running,crouching; pretty much anything that requires specific actions and attention are lacking.IE: Shooting down the sights..., dear god the sight aiming... (I won't even discuss sniping because it was better to shoot from the hip with them more than half the time). So You look down the sights, line up a head shot, or even a bloody body shot. 10m away, easy right? hahah yeah no. You could potentially (AND I DID) end up wasting a full clip(s) trying to shoot this one npc. It was beautifully disgusting.- x50; Ai. Stupidest ai since... erm... Sims? Yes, the sims. You know, the little imaginary people you get to control and can't figure out how to not drown in a kiddie pool once you take out their ladder, or are starving because they are tired and tired because they are starving? Yes them. THAT is your ai friends, who shoot at walls, corner you so you can't continue (ie:fallout, you know what I mean), and just are generally the most ridiculous things ever.Also, they are whiney as hell and keep yelling the same thing over and over like they have one script for the area you are in. Next area? Cool they'll say something new! Over, and over, and over again; while shooting at a wall.The enemy ai? Well, they have unlimited ammo (and yours is scarce, go figure), so not much different with them. OH, except for will direct ALL attention to you as soon as you enter the area, even if you haven't shot anything or looked at them or done anything to attract attention (including sneaking into the area and hiding behind crates. Be prepared for unlimited grenades to be thrown at you.)I can talk about damage and how you need a ""few"" head shots to kill a basic enemy with a m16 (decent gun in the game fyi), but with their little subs they can put you down in seconds flat, even if you can't see them, THEY SEE YOU >.> Oh and they like throwing grenades at you; not just the enemies but your friendlies too. Always a good time when they throw grenades at you, while you're searching for hidden things, when no enemies are around, while yelling at you to hurry up every 2 seconds. **ALMOST DONE I SWEAR****Caution there will be slight spoilers ahead**Storyline? I really like the idea, but I already told you that. And by the stuff I just told you, you can imagine I died close to 200 times, easily. So with load times, getting food because food is comforting when I'm distraught, eating said food instead of moving along in the game, and actually playing the game; LOOK AT MY PLAY TIME. The game is beat. donezo. I played on normal because usually my first playthrough I want it a little easier challenge but moreso for storyline, if I go back for another playthrough I go harder (easy is like, no. Not happening, ever). SO, with that I'm concluding to you that this game is way to short. And its not even like they finished the storyline! There was so much potential like meeting ""The voice of freedom"" or battling to washington, ect. This comes in to where I said I had thought I played the demo and then nope? Well, after the ""final"" chapter I was like ooooo whats next!?! GOD, DAMN, CREDITS thats what. I was mortified. There was no conclusion (good or bad or anything), its an open ended game which is cool if you want to write fanfiction for it (pl0x don't), but there was nothing! Even the final voice of freedom announcement could have led to the next mission. I'm just, UGH. I liked the gameplay, as ridiculously not good as it was for pc. I liked the storyline, as whiney and stupid the ai were and how short it was. But, really, I'm sticking with this and DO NOT recommend this. If you don't feel the same then thats ok, but I just can't bring myself to actually hit the thumbs up in this review... This game disappointed me. IF you want to feel the horror I did when playing this emotional roller coaster, then I advise you to grab it yourself when you see it DIRT♥♥♥♥♥CHEAP on sale. **Caution have comfot food (pizza) at the ready**~~Sorry, quick edit here for you~~This is just for single-player campaign, I will re-edit this when I bring myself to do multiplayer (its still a thing right?). Thank-you.			",224,30,1,33,39,1,44

												I took the opportunity and bought Homefront on sale for 4.59E... and have doubts if it was worth it. I have heard a lot how short the campaign is these word proved to be 100% true. Whole set of chapter took me 3.5-4 hours. Unfortunately the story and characters aren't as good as I heard. It's medicore. Easy to predict, seen earlier many times and directed rather poorly. Rianna, Connor, Boone... I've been with those guys beofre, they just had different names. Only Hopper and his skill with handling mortar shines a bit. Andwhen it omes to gameplay mechanic? No... The worst are invisible walls - quite a lot of the set in places where their only purpose is to mask that enemies are spawning out of nowhere. player is expected to follow limited path if he doesnot want to risk that high difficulty enemies spawns from already secured direction and kills you in one burst. Which - that killing in one burst - would be a good thing if enemies were appeaing in some reasonable manner instead out of the♥♥♥♥♥ When it comes to multiplayer... Where it is, pretty dead. There are still 2 servers that are full or almost full. But the gameplay is not xactly my taste. Killstreaks and battle points are quite nice but the maps are too small to introduce tanks, humvees, AFVs and choppers althogether. honestly, with 32 players spawning rather randomly it turns into cluster♥♥♥♥ where skill comes tetiary to luck and unlocked gear.

												No way could I recommend this game, especially now. I've played it, I've beaten the single player campaign, and it's the most generic shooter story ever with generic dystopian american underdog setting against North Korea (?!?). There's generic stereotype characters such as voiceless protagonist, and a compassionate rebel vs ruthless rebel dynamic. Even generic grab at your heart string moments. All under a generic, on-rails, brainless 4 hour run and gun play style where all the guns are accurate enough for head shots, so just take a big light machine gun and maybe a weapon of choice as you grind through less than 10 levels worth of enemies, all while you comprehend why they played up that you're a pilot and you only pilot an aircraft for a single level.I do believe Homefront's single player experience was supposed to be bigger and more dynamic, but clearly development time had butchered the story into what it is today. With multiplayer reportedly dead, I'd hardly see any point to buying this game for it's single player alone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoy COD campaings, this game will be right up your alley. It has a pretty good story, a cool settings and a few epic moments sprinkled here and there. Overall, a very enjoyable SP campaign. unfortunately, MP is dead, and the game is ridiculously short . We're talking around 4 hours on normal dfficulty.  (3.6 hours for me according to Steam)I was lucky enough to get this game for only £6 so i'd say it was worth it.  It definitely isn't worth £15 though. That price is an absolute joke. Pick this up on sale if you enjoy COD campaings.. You wont be dissapointed6/10. I would have been a 7 if it wasn't so short			",178,3,2,12,3,0,10

												The game may be fairly old but it is far too buggy even for an old game. Compared to an old game like Skyrim which also has bugs, Homefronts bugs are game breaking.

												Decent enough story which keeps you involved. Some different types of gameplay thrown in (like flying a helicopter) and all in all a decent shooter with nice graphics, good AI and decent maps and weapons. Shame it was all over so quickly though - probably only 5 or 6 hours of gameplay on normal difficulty. Gun sound, music and noises works fine. Sometimes the characters repeat instructions so long, until you perform the instructions. This could be annoying from time to time, when you look around and search the newspaper reports about the background story.			",313,18,14,20,6,2,27

												HomeFront:A very well made game, with a great story and a great gameplay. The shotting system actually has a good recoil and it works great and every bullet hits. The big arsenal this game is offering you makes it even funner to play. Its kinda SHORT, I got to give it that, but those were 3hrs of alot of fun, enjoining a great story and great graphics as well.

												This Game is OK I give it a 2.5/5The reason I rate this game as such is because the Story mode is supposed to be the selling point of this game and I have to say it is to short and to boring. After the first 20 mins I found myself trying to rush through the whole story without taking time to understand the plot. The multiplayer is trash, anyone can easily tell that the developers did not put time into the multiplayer. at the end what this game is missing is a more engaing story, a longer campaign and some more originality (like comon am I the only one that felt like this was some kinda crappy COD mod). Also with this kinda story I was expecting some kinda co-op Story mode?!??so I stand by my judgement THIS GAME SUX....kinda			",50,2,0,2,3,0,5

												Invisible walls everywhere - at several points you're only allowed to walk around an object on one side (e.g. at a library, I tried to go to the right of an awning support, close to the wall - no, you're supposed to go left, more out in the open).Rather unbalanced - extremely easy at some parts, ridiculously hard at others.  About two hours of gameplay - due to getting killed and having to reload, it took me four.  NPCs would soak up entire clips of bullets without taking damage, but then later one got hit and killed by a single bullet during a scripted event - it really destroyed the suspension of disbelief.Scripted to within an inch of its life - at one point you are forced to talk to every person in a farming community before you are allowed to proceed with the storyline.  They will not let you proceed until you've sat and listened to each person spout their boring dialogue - and there's no way to skip.			",290,46,18,42,38,0,46

												It's quite decent. Not sure why this game gets the bad rap that it often does. The campaign, although a bit on the short side (7 missions, though they are beefy-sized) is very fun and adrenaline-packed. The premise for the story is original, but the progression of it is kind of bland and the characters aren't very interesting, besides a certain war machine you get to wreak some delicious havoc with a few times (if that can constitute a character). The guns are fun to use and sexy as hell. They feel like, say, a mixture of Call of Duty's and Killzone's guns. The multiplayer is very well-done too, but the active servers are a bit on the short side.Overall, I'd say this game is a little underrated and didn't get the attention it deserved, despite it having a few weakspots. I had to play it on minimum graphics settings and the lowest resolution (800x600) because I had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC, and I still had a great time with it. It's definitely worth at least a rental/borrow.

												Home is where the war is!.. Really, This must been one of the most exciting and real war games i have played. It is rare for me to actualy enjoy a game this much that i finished it in one day. The story is so real, The background npcs events are so real, The happenings are so sad and really feels connected.. Great weapons and such, Awesome grapics aswell! I'm so glad i played this. Bad things: It only took me 3 hours to finish, It has multiplayer, But i dont really play that so can't judge. Altough i heard it has a lot of hackers. So only buy it for the single player story imo. It also has a few grapic glitches, such as shadows being a little wierd.. But overall it looks very good!..I got this game on sale for about 7$, And its really worth the money even with the 3 hours of gameplay only. But yeah, If you get this for single player. I suggest a sale. Its worth about 10$ imo. Ill rate is 8.5 out of 10. (Single player story only).			",325,84,15,55,58,3,63

												Homefront is a pretty good single player experience. The campaign is pretty short, I finished it in 4.3 hours but it was solid. The gun play was great and the missions were challenging enough. My only small complaint is that the player feels a bit heavy when moving and sprinting feels more like a light jog.Overall I'd recommend at the current sale price at the time of writing for a few hours of shooting and story. Warning: Do not buy for multiplayer, it appears to be dead. At the time of writing I just finished the campaign and checked the multiplayer option and there was only one server with players and it only had 7 so if you are buying it is for the campaign only.

												I only have 3 hours on record, cause that's how long it took to beat the game in an easy setting. I was only interested in playing through the campaign (I don't even know if a multiplayer scene exists). I actually bought this game for $5 in retail store and imported it into my steam account. As many others have said, the storyline was decent. If you've seen Red Dawn (particularly the newer one), then you'll already see the next thing coming in some instances. The shooting mechanics and overall game mechanics worked fine, there were really no real issues in playability. I may play through campaign again on a harder difficulty, I am unsure. I recommend this game on the fact that you enjoy single player campaign, with a decent story, if you're an FPS player, AND if the price tag were $15 or $20 OR LESS.			",63,1,0,4,6,0,4

No online servers have people in them and DLC's just not worth it. On sale for $4 and you got the cash to spend and a few hours to kill its great. But its just that.			",56,4,3,10,3,0,1

												From what I've read, the general consensus on Homefront is that it's just average. After finally getting around to finishing it, I think the reviewers may have sold it a tad short. I mean, I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but I also found very little wrong with it. I guess the biggest issue is that the single player (which is all I cared about) only took 4-5 hours to finish. So while it definitely wasn't worth the original asking price, now that it's only $20, it may not be a bad investment if you have ever had any interest in playing it. As far as the gameplay goes, it's pretty standard for a modern shooter. Mostly you shoot people (duh), but some levels mix it up with vehicle sections and other types of mechanics. The final level is also pretty epic. What sets Homefront apart from most shooters is the story, the premise being an alternate future where North Korea has occupied the US. All in all, it's a decent, but short game. Perfect for FPS fans to kill time on a rainy afternoon.			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

												You think you're a good FPS player? Then join to the Homefront and show what you can do in multiplayer mode. I'll see you in the game!Uważasz się za dobrego gracza FPS? W takim razie dołącz do gry i pokaż na co Cię stać w trybie multiplayer. Widzimy się w grze!Homefront is awesome game. I love it so much.Nie jest to gra idealna, ale w pewnym sensie wyjątkowa. Spędziłem wiele miłych chwil grając w trybie wieloosobowym, dlatego mogę Ci ją polecić jako zamiennik CoD-a czy BF-a.Spaliła mi kartę w 2011, a ja i tak nie dałem za wygraną i wróciłem do niej!

												As it is, I can't finish the game. I'm currently working on trying to fix it, but I seem to be stuck at a spot in the early part of the game because it isn't continuing the story after I finish running to a tower to avoid being burned alive. I hope to be able to get passed this part, though, since I'm finding the story to be quite intense and well done. The gameplay is pretty standard, but not bad. And don't believe the people saying it's only 3 hours to play through the whole campaign. I've played longer than the recorded ""less than an hour"" at the time of this review, since I'll play in offline mode, and I've only really made it passed the first two chapters of seven total.If you can get it on sale, I'd say to grab it if it sounds like a story you'd like to play. Otherwise, get it at full price if you feel like you need another game to add to your library that's pretty good for casual gaming.			",114,17,1,14,4,1,21

												Excellent, awesome, emotional opening sequence. Good campaign. Great graphics. Shooting mechanics work well, but doesn't feel as tight as some other FPS games (though you can adjust sensitivity for ADS seperately from overall sensitivity). I haven't played MP-so no comments on that, (don't know if people even still play), other than its got your typical game modes you'd find in FPS (CTF, Domination, TDM). Campaign is about 2/3 of a Call of Duty campaign, but more original (North Korean invasion instead of Russian ultranationalists as the bad guys for 3+ installments that we see in COD). I was much more invested in the story in this game than almost any other game I've played. The emotional aspect really hits ""home"" (especially if you consider yourself a US patriot).Excellent game to play in conjunction with watching the Australian movie Tomorrow, When the War BeganDEFINITELY BUY IT ON SALE, & prepare for the next installment of Homefront: The Revolution, coming 2015.

												A great multiplayer game that was ahead of its competition at its time of release. Sadly gamers these days prefer to cannibalize franchises until they are rotten to the core, leaving games that come out under the wrong banner, to die in the sidewalk.First off if you are thinking of buying this for the single player then don't. It's in tune with other war-themed sp campaigns out there: i.e bad. So what makes this game great? Big, detailed maps. Point based perks + killstreaks to ensure balance. Most killstreaks are skill triggered/manual. Vehicles. Guns feel solid, movement is smooth and gunplay is fast. Battle commander mode is a nice twist on regular game modes. You are given all the right tools to battle both camping and vehicle-stomps/ the game is not easy to cheese or grief. Teamwork is on the lukewarm side as you can lone-wolf if you want. All in all if you want a mp game that plays like a CoD-flavored battlefield then there's nothing that beats this at the moment			",1099,275,40,107,53,11,125

												I only played the single player on the game so just a few comments on the game.  Single player is incredibly short but also very fun.  With the backstory to the game there probably could have been a lot more added but even with what little campaing there was it was very enjoyable.The story was great in my opinion.  Not the typical you are a military super soldier and you go to whatever country and kill a bunch of terrorists.  No you are fighting for the USA that's been invaded by a united North/South Korea.  The story worked for me because of the setting and enviroment that the Devs created.  There was some incredibly gruesome scenes as well a touch of realism as people are going to do what they feel is best for their survival and it wasn't just everyone against the invaders.Loved the setting and enviroments that you play through in the game.  Some of the areas are semi generic cover based shooting but some of the locations do evoke some sense of feeling in the game whether pity or anger at whats happening.  The only complaint is that as a FPS the areas are very linear and would have been nice to explore some of them a little more freely maybe open up more paths to achieve the goal.The game also varied the pacing in the levels for the most part as well.  In some levels it was a constant frenzy of action while others were a little slower with small burts of action to break up the tension.  Again it worked for me because if it was just all 100% constant action shooting every enemy you came across it would get bland fast.  Good deal of weapons in the game, mostly automatic weapons, would have been nice to get some more variety in pistol/shotguns or other weapons instead of just from dozens of different assult rifles.  I also liked that there wasn't just a ton of ammo laying around everywhere to collect.  I was switching between a variety of weapons to keep my ammo up as when I'd get a new weapon there wasn't always ammo for it and I'd be on the lookout for me next weapon or playing a little more conservatively to make what ammo I had count.Only complaint would be that the character model gets caught up on really odd pieces of terrain and you can't tell if you should be able to get past an area or not.  Sometimes there looks to be a path but you get caught on something.			",213,33,0,39,14,2,28

												This is the voice of freedom.You will constantly hear this phrase being uttered throughout the cutscenes of Homefront. It does make you sort of feel like you are fighting for a cause, which I think works well for the game.Story: Homefront's story is easily the best part of the game. The game is set in a dystopian world in the year 2027. North Korea has taken over the United States and you, Robert Jacobs, a former U.S. Marine Corps helicopter pilot is part of the Resistance who are trying to regain control of the country. You team up with other characters such as Boone, Connor and Rianna. I honestly feel that each of these characters are annoying. They are one-dimensional and offer nothing better to say than cliched phrases or cheesy dialogue. Although the plot of the game is interesting it ends quite abruptly and I felt like that could be due to time constraints and as a result, the campaign is quite short (clocks in at 3.5-4 hours).Graphics: The visuals of the game are decent for a game released in 2011. When the game released, I heard many complaints about how the games graphics were poor and looked like a PS2 game. On normal graphics settings, the game looks as good as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 with sharp character textures, beautiful lighting and detailed environments.Sound: Each gun sounded different, with a unique pop to each of them. The characters although annoying, were not bland to listen to and each voice actor did well with the script that was given to them. Gameplay: The gameplay is fast, fluid and fun. Homefront's gameplay draws alot of inspiration from the Call of Duty series and has done well to emulate it's feel. Each gun handles differently and are a joy to use.Overall, Homefront is a decent FPS game. It's story isn't spectacular by any means and the gameplay is what you would expect in games such as Call of Duty. The campaign is short but sweet and I'd only recommend a purchase if this game is on sale.7/10. ",190,5,2,16,3,2,10

												This game follows too far in the footsteps of Call of Duty's on-rails action. Too. Far. E.g., Instructed to snipe a buttdong once I have him in my sights, I immediately take the shot: I am detected, the mission is failed and I restart from the nearest checkpoint. I get to the same moment and wait--wait for this stupid flippin' NPC telling me what to do to finish his stupid flippin' sentence so this stupid flippin' game tells me I can take the shot--the same silenced, undetectable shot--without failing the stupid flippin' mission.Design like this in the shadow of this entire game, nearly beginning to end. The introduction is great, but the gameplay feels like you're kinda floating around in space, struggling to follow NPCs' instructions from one White Castle to next advertisement.I can't, however, decide if whether or not I regret playing it....

												Cool game. Violent, epic storyline, good voice acting, crazy cinematic action scenes. This isn't normally the type of game I'd be into but I love action games in general. It has regenerating health (at least on Easy) but it's still quite difficult. At least to me. If you die though you just reload to your last checkpoint. There were a few areas where I had to reload several times, because you're always outnumbered, you can only take a few hits, and the enemies are very good shots. You have to use cover, flank, and play smart. Easy mode is about as tough as Saints Row 3/4 on Normal or Hard. But it's cool, I really like it!Unfortunately the multiplayer is PVP only. No co-op vs. AI or bots. That's too bad because the gameplay is really good. Vehicles, good shooting mechanics, you can crouch or lay down, and the graphics are amazing. I can't tell the difference between the graphics in this game and titles that came out in 2014 or 2015.If you're looking for a really cool singleplayer campaign experience, this is a good one. My only gripes are that it's an FPS, which isn't my favorite genre, there's no FOV slider, and there's no co-op multiplayer.			",464,85,34,90,83,1,92

												A great multiplayer game that was ahead of its competition at its time of release. Sadly gamers these days prefer to cannibalize franchises until they are rotten to the core, leaving games that come out under the wrong banner, to die in the sidewalk.First off if you are thinking of buying this for the single player then don't. It's in tune with other war-themed sp campaigns out there: i.e bad. So what makes this game great? Big, detailed maps. Point based perks + killstreaks to ensure balance. Most killstreaks are skill triggered/manual. Vehicles. Guns feel solid, movement is smooth and gunplay is fast. Battle commander mode is a nice twist on regular game modes. You are given all the right tools to battle both camping and vehicle-stomps/ the game is not easy to cheese or grief. Teamwork is on the lukewarm side as you can lone-wolf if you want. All in all if you want a mp game that plays like a CoD-flavored battlefield then there's nothing that beats this at the moment			",1099,275,40,107,53,11,125

												The Good:Story line is good, voice acting is decent and some of the cinematography is really nice. The Bad:That said the engine is clunky, the campaign is way to short (4hrs) and the sound started to get a little static in it about halfway through. It was also annoying how you are stuck next to you ""team mate"" in some situations, want to walk off the platform? nope got to wait till the AI tells you its ""time to move"". A little annoying but you get used to it.I didn't recommend this game because I wouldn't pay full price for it, even with out the clunky AI interaction and sound issues 4hrs is not worth $20. Now for $5 it is a fun story to play through.			",138,18,0,9,6,2,13

												I think this game is very underrated. It has got a great story (with a great backstory involved), good shooting, nice environments (even though sometimes it's rather gritty) and overall I think it's a enjoyable game. The only thing that I think it could do somewhat better is the characters, you don't really care that much about them... and the developers really tried to create those ""sad moments"" where someone dies and you get somewhat emotional, the problem is that with no emotional connection, you don't really get that emotional when that happens.Then there's the multiplayer. It's mostly a copy of Call of Duty's multiplayer with the only difference being that you can call in vehicles for you to operate. One nice thing though - it's still somewhat active. But stay away from the CHEAT SERVER!Well, Kaos Studios really outdone themselves with Homefront. Their first (and only other) game was Frontlines: Fuel of War and that game was 100% garbage.Looking forward to the sequel - Homefront: The Revolution. It's going to be great.

												Well. Homefront wasn't actually terrible. It wasn't very good either though.Lets start with the flaws. For starters, the campaign is notably short and can be beaten in about 4 hours, which includes dying a number of times. The plot is basically Call of Duty: Red Dawn, but a lot less military based and a bit more guerilla warfare based. Basically, it's not very unique. The context is that in 2013, after the Supreme Leader of North Korea dies, his son unites the North and South to form the Greater Korean Republic. This should be the biggest clue that Homefront is purely speculative fiction and not to be taken seriously as that will never happen. The South (South Korea) had seperated from North Korea just as the Korean war started because of the atrocities that were going on. Anyway, fast forward to 2025, the GKP is a world power and has already taken over four other countries and begins their invasion of the USA. Another two years later, it's 2027 and you are Robert Jacobs, a former Marine combat pilot who is awakes in his beat apartment in Montrose, Colorado. The Koreans have seized the town and are sending you to Alaska for ""re-education"". Well, as you can assume, you're rescued by the resistance and recruited to help fight the good fight. That's pretty much it. There's little development in character or tone, it's just very one sided. At least Call of Duty (everything since Modern Warfare)  gave the villains a sort of character to help build up their wrongdoings. You don't even get to know the Koreans, they're just targets for all of you.SPOILERS: There is one level where there might be some shift in tone, but it ends up being a massive firefight anyway. American survivalists; those nut jobs who like to keep their guns close in case something like this would ever happen, which won't. It won't ever happen. But people like the people in this game do exist. In one of the missions, these survivalists have a helicopter you need and basically you end up killing them all.Well, at least the audio design and graphics were nice. The campaign was still fun to play, but it's nothing special. More of thing where you play it just to pass the time and you only own it because it was in a THQ Humble Bundle or it was on sale for like 3 bucks.7/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

They never develop most of the characters to the point you feel and connection to them.Overall, it had alot of potential and plenty of fun moments, but falls flat of being a good game due to the lack of content and abrupt ending.

												I must say, I was both surprised and horrified by playing this game. If you are looking for a cheap and simple FPS with an engaging storyline, then this game will be a nice addition to your library. However, there is an issue that needs to be addressed.The game is short. Very short. I completed my Normal Playthrough in just under 4 hours. And that sadly left a very bitter pill in my mouth. Such a shame considering the length the game went for me to sympathise and rationalise everything, for it to just simply end like that. I have no comment regarding mulitplayer. I have no desire to try it.It's currently on sale, and if you were to ask me if it was worth £4. I would say Yes.			",222,96,1,30,19,4,24

												This is essentially one of the better FPS's of it's time as it were. It was as good as Call of Duty. I thoroughly enjoyed Homefront, although I cannot say the same about the it's sequal. Not that I have played it. It just doesn't leave off from the first game which angers me. Anyhow, I have played this on the PS3 and it was awesome. I got it again on the PC because I wanted to relive it. Relive shooting North Korean soldiers. This game has been out for years now and I'm going to spoil the beginning for you because it sets you in the mood to have no sympathy for the North Koreans.Homefront is set in a dystopic United States, in the year 2027. The game's backstory dates back to the 2010s, where there are high tensions between North Korea and the global powers due to the country's military aggression, including its successful nuclear weapons test and the sinking of a South Korean ship. That's from the wiki anyhow. But you start as Robert Jacobs who is a former U.S. Marine Corps helicopter pilot. North Korean guards bust into your apartment and drag you away on an awating bus to be sent to a ""re-education"" camp in Alaska. As the bus starts and starts heading out of the city, you look around as people around you are also being taken away, shot and killed, or just trying to get by. The beginning is a part that gets me the most and will ultimatly show as the North Koreans and plain ruthless m0therfu ckers and if you already didn't hate them now. You'll hate them even more. (Y'all can skip this if you want) You come upto an intersection, looking to your left are two people begging for their life as their child, not much more than atleast 4 or 5 years old is standing behind them. As they beg for their life, the two North Korean guards shoot them, killing them and walk off as you hear the now orphaned child scream and cry as he walks upto his dead parents. And boy did that ever♥♥♥♥♥♥me the h311 off. What happened next is a flat nosed semi truck T-bones the bus, killing almost everyone on the bus (there weren't that many to begin with, just a couple guards and prisoners.) except you and a guard. A couple of resistance fighters board the now upside down bus and hands you a gun and off you go on a series of missions to try and get some fuel tankers to the U.S. Army held up in San Fransisco as your primary mission. Ladies and Gentlemen. My review may not do this game justice, but this game is 100% pure bada$$. The sounds are awesome, you have a nice array of weapons, there's enough explosions to make Michael Bay ♥♥♥♥♥♥, many people may not play it's multi-player anymore but who cares? You'll have enough fun slaughtering North Koreans as you fight your way through many other resistance fighters. You will love this game, trust me. You will. And if you don't. Then I have no words other than you just can't appreciate a good game such as this. ♥♥♥♥ the sequal. It doesn't do this games justice. But trust me, you'll like it.			",43,1,2,3,12,0,1

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Homefront is a first person action game developed by KAOS Studios and published by the now defunct studio, THQ. Homefront tells the story of a resistance movement fighting back against a near future Korean occupation of the USAThe game play is a very generic FPS. Graphics wise, it looks nice, but you can tell the game was released in 2011, it looks better than most games released, however it shows it's age when comparing it to more recent titles. The graphical options are wide varyingAll the maps in the single player are very well designed, sadly you can't really explore because you are constantly reminded to keep following your squad leader. You fight through various different environments such as the streets of suburbs, department stores, and baseball fields, all of which show a disturbing outcome of the quite scary ""what if?"" scenario from a Korean invasionThe single player of Homefront will take about five hours to complete; this is pretty short and the game ends on a massive cliff hanger, I would of liked to have seen another two or three more missions to tire up the loose ends in the story. Multiplayer is still very much alive in Homefront, I have only played in a couple of games but I had no problem finding a map full of people to jump intoI would like to recommend Homefront; however I would wait till it is on sale, which would be an absolute bargain if you could get it for that again in an upcoming sale RECOMMENDED :)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This one is highly underated. The battle points system works better than the over saturation of ""Kill Streaks"" that has taken over Call of Duty. Maps aren't BF3 size but larger that COD making for variable play styles. Helicopter can be a pain without but overall work. A great game.  ",219,9,1,11,10,0,19

												Wow, I'm impressed! Homefront exceeded every expectation I had and then some. So glad I bought it on a whim when it randomly went on sale.This is the game I can imagine would be born if Half-Life 2 and Spec Ops: The Line had a baby together. If you've played both of those and then you play this I think you'll instantly be able to tell why.Mechanically, it's pretty much the same as every other shooter. The guns and enemies are pretty standard. The guns themselves have a lot of variety but most of the rifles feel so similar that it doesn't really matter. I found myself choosing which to use more based on which scope was attached than any other attribute. The enemies could have used some more variety and better AI, but in the end the game didn't hinge on either of these things.What matters is the story and the world they created. It's a distopian future where you sometimes fight alongside a squad of NPCs and a robot companion against a foreign occupying force (that's the Half-Life 2 part). But they did such a good job presenting this world I'm in awe. There are tiny touches everywhere: things happening in the background, banter that's easy to miss, all these really human moments that make the game come alive. Because of that it felt a lot like The Last of Us during the early levels.Stylistically it's a bit dated even for 2011 game - honestly it looks a lot like Half-Life 2. The models and textures have a pretty flat look to them, and none of the shininess that a lot of games from the era seem to have everywhere. The lighting and depth of field effects are amazing at points though, even if the game were made today. They're subtle but effective. The backgrounds are often pure works of art.The sound system is crisp and includes great voice acting. The score is epic and memorable and features some hilarious yet appropriate tracks from real life bands.Overall I loved playing through it twice (once on the highest difficulty and once for collectibles and achievements). I only wish that there were bots for the multiplayer so that I could try it out, as there are literally zero people online nowadays.I'm psyched that there's a sequel in development. Seriously can't wait to get back into this world. Here's a trailer:

												This game is great. If you're looking for a break from COD, its right here. Similar style to BC2  but the battle points system thats implemented is genius. I cant praise it enough.

												For 20 dollars the game did not have enough campaghn (how do you spell) but it had good graphics, lots of dialogue and kept you interested for 4 hours. It did have good variety in its missions and had great graphics. TBH it did match to call of duty game quite well but it still had more variety (and a semi-boss battle). I think the game is worth 15 dollars but still think its a great game. I beat the game in 4 hour on hard and i died like 50 times. So lets put it that its good in most ways except for campighn length.			",140,11,9,5,18,0,4

												Homefront commits every cardinal sin that a first person shooter can commit. Bad gunplay with too little ammo, not enough gun variety and underpowered weapons.AI companions that do absolutely nothing. An extremely bad story. Cheap deaths. Poor enemy AI that are both bullet sponges and aim-bots. Terrible set pieces that last entirely too long. And oh yeah multiplayer is dead. Should you buy this game?

												Ok, so I played this game on console back when it was released, I borrowed it of a mate, completed the campaign, and gave it back.I thought it was good and worth a play, so when I saw it for <£3 I decided to pick it up on steam.Now, as I replayed the campaign, I started to remember just how much I enjoyed playing it the first time, and the same can be said for now, despite being a bit short, (Though still think it is longer than most of the Call of Duty campaigns), it is brilliant, dark and rather unsettling at points.Now one thing I never played before was the multiplayer, and I know people are saying the MP is dead, but they are WRONG.There is usually only 1 or 2 servers playing, but so what, there are people coming in and out of the servers constantly so there are usually anywhere between 24-36 player online at once, and that is more than enough for me to of played about 6 hours of online in 2 days.The online has some bad points, such as few weapons, (5 Assault rifles, 2 SMG's, 2 LMG's and 2 Sniper rifles) and low player count. But this is very minor, I have enjoyed playing the MP, using drones and vehicles alongside infantry, and the vehicles are surprisingly well balanced, maybe excluding the helicoptors, but they are aggrivating to pilot which means unless your truely skilled at piloting then your going to struggle getting kills.The graphics are good, the gameplay is good, the game is great.I only wish I had bought this when it first came out on Steam, so I could play in different servers with more players.

												First I have to get this out of the way, the single player game sucks! I think that Kaos put the focus on multi-player and it shows in a brilliant execution.The maps offer something different on every change up, which will entice you to want to change weapon classes as the scenery changes. i.e shotgun in the supermarket aisles or sitting on top of the hoover damn with a sniper rifle. The battlepoint system is a great switch from the popular ""killstreak system"" and offers even mediocre players a chance to take out the big vehicles and airstrikes etc at least once a match if they save the points. The drones add a totally new dimension to the standard FPS format (having to watch the skies as well as the horizon), and the overall feel to game play is absolutely unique .The weapon balancing is perfect (not on all servers) and the vehicle physhics are well done. (again not on all servers weapon balance and expert vehicle control are admin options) Overall this is the best military FPS I've played yet.			",488,97,11,36,33,6,68

												<!-- Updated Review -->Initial Thoughts & ObservationsI'll begin by acknowledging that the length of this game is very short. I would say that there's about 7 Chapters in the game, and each chapter varies in length. Gameplay & MechanicsThere is a low amount of complexity to the game overall, and it's fairly linear as to what you can do, and when you can do it. I was constantly finding myself having to wait for NPC_1 or NPC_2 to get to a location before I was able to complete an action. There were situations where I would know where the NPC was going, but because I walked there before the time I was supposed to be there, the NPC would be stuck in an animation where they would never complete the action. Story & PlotOne are that left a lot to be desired would have to be the story. I wouldn't say the story was bad, but I will say that it would have been connected better. To me, it felt as though you went from one scenario to the next too quick, and without any real explanation to why you are doing this, going there, or meeting them. The story has the ability to be high production, but because of the inability to connect each chapter seemlessly, you don't really understand the story itself, but instead understand the overall premise, which is that you're rebelling against invaders.Weapons & CustomizationThere's not many weapons to choose from, I would guess about 12, and you will probably constantly find yourself choosing between 3 of them throughout the game, minus a couple chapters. The struggle that I found myself in a lot was when I would find a weapon I liked a lot, particularly the SCAR, but ammo would be fairly scarce. Now this is not the case in all levels, but seldom did I encount enemies had SCARs versus the other handful of guns in the game, so some chapters force you to pick up a weapon that you might not like. There are different weapon skins that you can see, but it's not something that you get to choose, instead an enemy may have a gun, and when you pick it up, it might have camo, or even a different color. There's a few attachments in the game, such as different scopes to use, as well as magazine sizes, but again that's randomly generated based on what enemy had it.Graphics & Level DesignGraphically, the game isn't too bad considering when it came out. As far as level design in concerned, I feel the game borrows a lot from games like Call of Duty. It seems very cookie-cutter, but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. It makes it a very familiar experience, but in it's own unique way. The beginning levels aren't very innovative, but as you progress midway through the game, it does add different varieties of gameplay.Final Thoughts & ConclusionThis was not a very groundbreaking game, and most people will probably feel the game seemed rushed. Having said that, I still found myself satisfied playing it. It's a FPS, that does exactly that. It's not trying to innovate in any areas, but is very reminescent of older FPS games. I wouldn't say this is a everyday shooter however, I would categorize this more as a casual FPS fore those looking to just play something quick. I would still recommend this game for any who generally loves FPS games, and who's interested in something that doesn't need heavy investment. I wouldn't necessarily pay full price for the game, but if you can find a deal on it, or for a reasonable price, I think it's worth picking up.<!-- Original Review -->To start off, I will say that this game is extremely short. As in, you can probably beat it in under 2 hours. Having said that, I enjoyed the game quite a bit. The game isn't too complex like your modern day shooters now, in fact it's really limited to what weapons there are to use, and where you can go. It's extremely linear in the sense that you have to wait for your teammates to finish their action before you can proceed. I would say there's about 12 total guns that you can use, and you really only get to use 3 of them for most of the game. I wouldn't say the story was entirely bad, but it wasn't something that pulled me in. For me, it felt like any other FPS, nothing really groundbreaking, but was satisfying as well. Regardless of it's flaws, I still found myself having a lot of fun progressing through the campaign. I wouldn't say it's a great buy for full price, but if you can find it for reasonably cheap, it's a good game that's quick, and offers fun for those who generally love FPS games.

												Idea is nice but Freedom Fighters published in 2003 did everything better. Homefront is full of invisible walls and every step feels scripted. If you go 10 meters away from the mission you get killed by invisible enemy in a hail of bullets. NPC are not memorable and plot is boring. NPC are blocking your way all the time and you have to do everything in correct order. Try to go ladders before npc, no chance. There could have been potential but this game is just poor man's Call Of Duty, I bought it from sale and for 4€ price it's okay game. Lot of action and different guns that make game playable. I would say 2/5.			",41,8,0,11,6,0,4

												Playing this game makes me angry.Angry that I paid any amount of money for the privilege of suffering through it. Angry that I went to the effort of obtaining it from an American friend when I heard they were (initially) blocking it on Steam in the UK, due to an amazingly stupid deal THQ struck up with high-street game retailers for (initial) exclusitivity. Angry that it's Baby's First Call Of Duty Clone. Angry that its heavy-handed message is either too transparent or lost in the mud. Angry that it's STILL a buggy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ with frequent graphical lockups and dialogue going waaaay out of synch with the animations. And finally, angry that I've had to wait until now to warn everyone about this anti-game, once again due to it not existing in the UK Steam Store until the deal expired.I'm almost disgusted that Valve gave it pride of place in the 4th Of July art for the Steam Summer Camp event. Only CoD fanatics could love this monument to everything wrong with modern 'AAA' FPSes.			",1550,670,77,224,205,18,306

												Although I tend to be easily exited about games, even if other players do not like them, this isn't the case for Homefront. I did not like this game. Pros:- Rianna, one of you team mates, is beautiful- Nice Setting on the Golden Gate Bridge during the final battle. It seemed to me like the developers kind of wanted to copy the bridge level from Half-Life 2 but failed to get it as epic.- Multiplayer is still active. I just played a quick game for 20 minutes and there were 19 people in the session. Not bad for a four year old game with moderate receptionCons:- very short campaign- got stuck many times in the middle of the action because I quickly wanted to move out of the line of fire but a chair or a tiny step kept me from moving- The game didn't start at first. This was related to physX issues. It took me a while to read the forums and experimenting to get the game working. Many players complain about this problem.- Extremely linear. Usually I do not mind if a game is linear but in this game you may not even crawl under a fence or climb a ladder or open a door before the other players entered first.- Too much talking. It's OK during the first play through but starts to suck if you replay levels. And you can't skip it.- Poor voice acting, except for Rianna, at least in GermanI do not recommend this game, even on sale.			",211,74,13,29,8,1,33

												I picked up Homefront from the $5 bin in Walmart knowing that the game was old and that it didn't receive much praise. I do agree that the story was a bit too short at only about five hours long. I still enjoyed the story based on its premise. With the USA being so high and mighty recently it is nice to see it being a hollow broken shell of itself. The look and feel of the game's atmosphere was very Red Dawn (the original 1980s movie) to me. Most of the characters where one dimensional and shallow but they do their jobs well. The game play is well complaint and works but parts of the game are very hand holding and scripted.  With a sequel on the horizon it will be interesting to see what happens with this well thought out but not quite well executed world.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is not an instant classic, there is no innovative game mechanics, no hi-end graphics and there's even no challengeful multiplayer. But this game has something that makes you want to play it at least once, but from start to finish: great story and atmosphere. If you're a fan of Cold War setting, this one is definetly for you. This game (made with the help of John Milius, writer and director of original ""Red Dawn"" movie) offers you to take a look on a near-future world where Great Korean Republic had invaded USA, and this look is pretty believable, enjoying and even fascinating. The sctructure of narrative grabs you right from the start and you will see this homeland war not as a guest but as a participant. It's just an interactive remake of ""Red Dawn"", and I should say, it's a great remake.			",134,7,0,6,6,0,32

												Underrated but still underwhelming, Homefront is a game that shows glimpses of promise and has tons of potential, but never fully delivers on what it could be.Homefront is a first-person shooter set in America during a fictional future in which a coalition of East Asian countries, namely Korea, control vast portions of the country. You play as a former military pilot who is rescued by an underground resistance unit fighting the occupation, with the eventual objective of assisting the scattered remnants of the U.S. military in San Francisco.While the graphics are undoubtedly dated, the gunplay here is solid, and the game shows you glimpses of this fictional America that could make for an amazing game had they been expanded upon more. Labor camps, fringe societies outside the influence of the Koreans, the resistance fighters or the U.S. government, and so many more areas that could have been expanded upon but never were.The multiplayer was underrated in its heyday but unfortunately is no longer populated and isn't really worth talking about.Since you are basically going to get this for the campaign alone, which is VERY short (3 hours on normal), you should only pick this up at a deep discount.

												Homefront is a stunningly bland, unexiting, derivative first person shooter which rips off Red Dawn but is somehow even less convincing and without any of its charm. It's gun play is mediocre. Its level design is boring, simplistic and painfully linear. It holds the players hand in an iron vice and refuses to allow any freedom. In one sequence you have to follow the instructions of your NPC commander to thin out a group of enemies. You are told exactly which enemy to shoot and when to shoot them. Deviation from this triggers a fail state. On top of all this the story is awful. It can't decide whether to be a macho action movie or a dark and gritty morally grey war story. The characters the story follows are universally paper thin and completely uninteresting. Normally when I spend five hours on a shooter I feel cheated, this time I wished it had finished sooner.Apparently the multiplayer was fantastic, but since it's dead that shouldn't influence your purchasing decision.

												This game is outstanding, in your face, awesome storytelling with non stop action all the way through. I found myself thoroughly engaged in the world. I had an absolute blast playing it. The online mode is comparable to other online FPS gems like CSGO. There is nothing like standing on top of a white castle sniping people who are running around the Hooters next door.The story mode took me somewhere between 6 and 8 hours to complete. Surviving and fighting in a world where a country invades America... the scenery is really interesting. The story is compelling. You want to take out the enemy and achive your goals.I give this game a 10/10.I would play through the story mode again and I continue to snipe people who hang out at Hooters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The storyline is a bit farfetched, considering that North Korea is not really a global superpower, but it is still very good at portraying what it would be like to live in a country where a hostile take over has occurred. As an FPS it plays very smoothly, and the keyboard controls make the game feel like it was designed for PC despite also being released on consoles. Also, this is the only game I've played where you have to disturbingly hide in a mass grave under corpses to get away from your enemy (although, this only happens once in the game, it was a very profound look into what people will do to survive in times of war).

												Homefront is a fairly incredible game. However, there is one problem I have with it:The ending, at least in my opinion, is a cliffhanger. It gives you a glimpse of what may be to come, but the entire setting is based on one city in America and it's fight to take back what belongs to them. While I enjoyed the game's story, I felt the ending was lacking. Feel free to tell me I'm wrong if there is anything I missed.I haven't played the Multiplayer.Great game, but 8/10.EDIT:Okay, so I recently learned that there is going to be a Sequel to Homefront, which makes me understand the Cliffhanger ending a bit more, but it's kinda ballsy to leave the first game on a Cliffhanger with a new franchise. My score remains the same, however.			",81,9,0,17,3,0,1

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game and it's storyline. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the concept very much, too much actually. But I just can't recommend this to anyone looking to buy it. Yes, I know FPS games tend to have very short storylines. But, not only was the storyline short, it wasn't rewarding at all. Once you beat this game, it will serve you best uninstalled. I completed it in roughly 5 and a half hours on the hardest difficultly, and was very disappointed with the ending. My other reason for not recommending this game is because multiplayer plays like a cheap knock off to Battlefield, at best. But that's my own rambling, I'm 95% sure the servers are shutdown now. If after reading this review and others, you still feel the desire to try this out, get it on sale. I wouldn't pay anymore than $5. And that's pushing it for a short and cheap distraction from life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I liked the campaign.  I felt it was a bit short, and there were some things I would have done differently, but overall it was fairly well made, and visually nice.I don't really get into multiplayer, so I don't have a lot to say about that.  The story was interesting, but I remember wishing it had more stealth options.  Also, I felt like the game was almost propaganda at some level.  I would hope people get there information about North Korea from something other than the worst-case scenario presented in this game ... maybe Crysis?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game and it's storyline. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the concept very much, too much actually. But I just can't recommend this to anyone looking to buy it. Yes, I know FPS games tend to have very short storylines. But, not only was the storyline short, it wasn't rewarding at all. Once you beat this game, it will serve you best uninstalled. I completed it in roughly 5 and a half hours on the hardest difficultly, and was very disappointed with the ending. My other reason for not recommending this game is because multiplayer plays like a cheap knock off to Battlefield, at best. But that's my own rambling, I'm 95% sure the servers are shutdown now. If after reading this review and others, you still feel the desire to try this out, get it on sale. I wouldn't pay anymore than $5. And that's pushing it for a short and cheap distraction from life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Homefront is a fairly incredible game. However, there is one problem I have with it:The ending, at least in my opinion, is a cliffhanger. It gives you a glimpse of what may be to come, but the entire setting is based on one city in America and it's fight to take back what belongs to them. While I enjoyed the game's story, I felt the ending was lacking. Feel free to tell me I'm wrong if there is anything I missed.I haven't played the Multiplayer.Great game, but 8/10.EDIT:Okay, so I recently learned that there is going to be a Sequel to Homefront, which makes me understand the Cliffhanger ending a bit more, but it's kinda ballsy to leave the first game on a Cliffhanger with a new franchise. My score remains the same, however.			",81,9,0,17,3,0,1

												This game is outstanding, in your face, awesome storytelling with non stop action all the way through. I found myself thoroughly engaged in the world. I had an absolute blast playing it. The online mode is comparable to other online FPS gems like CSGO. There is nothing like standing on top of a white castle sniping people who are running around the Hooters next door.The story mode took me somewhere between 6 and 8 hours to complete. Surviving and fighting in a world where a country invades America... the scenery is really interesting. The story is compelling. You want to take out the enemy and achive your goals.I give this game a 10/10.I would play through the story mode again and I continue to snipe people who hang out at Hooters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The storyline is a bit farfetched, considering that North Korea is not really a global superpower, but it is still very good at portraying what it would be like to live in a country where a hostile take over has occurred. As an FPS it plays very smoothly, and the keyboard controls make the game feel like it was designed for PC despite also being released on consoles. Also, this is the only game I've played where you have to disturbingly hide in a mass grave under corpses to get away from your enemy (although, this only happens once in the game, it was a very profound look into what people will do to survive in times of war).

												There are 2 good things about this game: the guns feel really nice to shoot. Also, the game is over very quickly (3 hours of being awful at it).Everything else is bloody atrocious. It's like playing your modern military shooter of choice, except doing so in syrup. It's so slow and clunky to do anything.Everything looks the same, or is the same - to use, to do, to shoot, to go. And then you commit war crimes and the single character who cares is pacified by saying 'we cannot fail'. Okay, makes sense.			",686,324,19,127,93,8,147

												I love this game. This game is much more personal than many other FPS' out there. It's got the best opening to a game I have seen since Resident Evil 2. You should Google it if you'd like to see what I mean, it won't spoil anything at all. There is just something great about a resistance, underdog type fight instead of the world's greatest military in other games. Although the campaign is short there are tons of hidden newspapers that are interesting to read and if you're into the story adds a lot building up to the events in the game. They're a lot of fun to read but you they aren't stored anywhere to read later so if you want to read them you have to do it then and there. To be honest I didn't get that drawn in to the world to read the newspaper however I always have to read documents. It's like a compulsion, but even I found myself skimming through many of them.

												As an idle diversion this was alright. If you're bored and it's on sale and you just wanna mindlessly destroy enemies, go for it.If you're going for something for story content, innovative gameplay or a new experience I'd suggest running away as fast as you can.I bought this title on sale for five dollars US, for five bucks I'd say it was worth it, I enjoyed it *JUST* enough to warrant it. For full price? I'd probably be pretty mad I bought it.My take on things:The Story:The story's background is so impossible you'd be more likely to encounter Santa astride a Unicorn than the scenario depicted in this game.The characters are tired stereotypes and overacted, sometimes hilarious so.The writers seemed to really want me to have an emotional response to this game and the events in it. If their goal was annoying me, they succeeded. If the intent was making me feel something for their poorly written characters they utterly failed.It was also extremely predictable, so many moments meant to be surprising weren't in the slightest.The Gameplay:It's a retextured Call of Duty, and it somehow managed to actually be worse than call of duty. This includes the ""shocking"" moments and first-person moments of your character being tossed about and blown around.It works off the exact same mechanics as Call of Duty, enemies endlessly spawn until the player advances to a certain point.All engagements play out almost exactly the same and get exceptionally boring.There's a complete lack of bullet penetration, shooting at an enemy behind plywood or a plastic traffic pylon results in absolutely nothing.I can recall years ago when this game was coming out a trailer touting that ""this game will be different"" and something close to ""we won't have you killing hordes of enemies, we want to avoid kill-fatigue in games like Call of Duty where you just kill people on automatic and don't even think about it after a certain point"". It was a blatant lie, I'd be hard pressed to point out a game with more generic enemies packed into small areas than this one.At the end of the day I've played worse, but not many.If you want a game wherein America is the one getting invaded and you don't mind an RTS I'd highly suggest World in Conflict as a viable and fun alternative. Much better writing, much more plausible story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The kid crying at the very beginning of the game is one of the best effects ever made..but that's about it...the story can be completed in under 5hrs, and it ends with a cliffhanger..the multiplayer is your regular cod dopy shooter but it had some god awful design choices.

												I regret even buying this game at $5,Single player was so overdone, cheesy, tryhard, and generally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I had to take breaks just to calm my cringe down. Good thing too as the campaign was probably only 3-4 hours long. I guess if you're still stuck in the 00's and enjoy a good direct2DVD or Mockbuster experience then this is your game. Honestly I felt like I could play Modern Warfare 2 and have a more polished experience.One story, breaching a garage I headshotted every dude inside except two standing by a wall full of explosive barrels. Guess what, even when you flank around them and shoot them the barrels explode. A lot of it was like 'The Best of: FPS scenes' and felt incredibly corperate and marketable. The only comment I had afterwards was how triple A gaming needs to die, like now.Multiplayer was pretty good though, but since it's so long after release at this point it's just a bunch of guys who got too good and are now circle jerking in their clan servers. Not a bad thing but I don't have the kind of time investment to join up at their skill level.			",119,6,9,12,6,0,13

												I just finished it finally and would recommended it for anyone who wants a generic shooter for $5 or less. Nothing more than $5 because it is very short, only about 4 hours long. Not great, but still more fun that a lot of other games like it. Despite coming out in 2011 and BF4 came out in 2013, this game has better friendly AI by a mile, where BF4 teammates would watch the enemy walk right by them and just stand still as they run by shooting at them.This game is nothing special and I am not sure why it deserved a sequel which we got anyway (thanks?) So either way it is still an alright 6/10 time for a once-through.6/10 get for $5 or less because it is very short.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												It’s just a mediocre linear modern shooting gallery that last 4 hours. Linear shooters can work just fine if it has good gunplay hell my favourite fps of all time is F.E.A.R and that game is very linear but in this game the gunplay is also just very mediocre, nothing about it stands out or makes it different. The bullet impact and guns feel dull and they sound dull too. It’s been done to death even back in 2011 the regenerating health, awful ai, modern setting with no colour, bland level design built around taking cover often etc. I could go on forever. I think the concept of the game saves it from being a bad game but they failed on telling a gripping story with great characters that you care for that’s for sure. 4/10 (Mediocre)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

If you want to stick around for a bit while I elaborate....then here goes. While the 'Red Dawn' inspired story isn't too bad....the gameplay is super generic. Trust me....everything that this games does....has been done before and done much better. Basically you follow a squad of extremely broken A.I. soldiers and I mean that literally. There will be plenty of times where you can't proceed until your numbskull teammates kick in a door....climb a ladder....or crawl underneath a fence. Sometimes....the person that you are supposed to be following....won't even budge. The guy will just sit there like he is writing his name in his own♥♥♥♥♥♥and you have no choice but to restart from a checkpoint. That's right....I said checkpoint. This game doesn't believe in saving....but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't. You should all save your money and spend it on a game that doesn't feature a rail sequence....where you shoot rockets at trucks....that are actually pretty rocket resistant. Seriously....that sequence is probably one of the worst levels in the history of gaming. Moving on....the graphics are actually quite good....aside from the few occasions where some of your teammates will radiate a glow like they drank the finest water that Chernobyl has to offer. The weapon selection is decent....and you can switch between two firearms at any given time. The controls are fairly responsive....when you are not flying a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥helicopter....that handles worse than a three-legged horse and buggy. Multiplayer is there....but not there at the same time....since nobody actually participates in it anymore. The game has numerous achievements....but I for one am not planning on spending any more time slogging through the kind of game that treats you alright one second....and then turns on you by slapping you in the face....and forcing you to pay for it's own rehab.

												I got this game as part of a bundle, so I'm okay with it. Otherwise, I wouldn't really recommend it.It's not a bad game, don't get me wrong. It's just so mindnumbingly generic that there's no point in playing it.The entire time I played it, I felt like I was playing diet Call of Duty, and we all know that Call of Duty is just diet FPS.So what is it? It's basically just Red Dawn. There's nothing special about it. The only thing that sticks out is just how little it sticks out.			",189,23,1,29,26,3,39

												First off I know that this is a very late review but i have to warn people NOT to get this game. Reason? (TL;DR at bottom, also ignore time played steam didn't even record down anything)Well to put it frankly the single player is boring, like really boring. It's your normal mordern FPS on the rail shooter. The game is slowed down by how many time you have to stop and wait for your NPC teammates to come and help you kick down a door. If you're not American the game becomes really really stale listening to American patrioism over and over again in the cutscene and how ""we"" must free ourselves how america is great and so on. It gets boring, and yes we know war is bad, the enemies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and so on and so forth.BUT what really prompted me to write this review was how bad the gameplay was, in the starting it was smooth and quite alright. Then you see these heavily armour enemies go down in a few shots (First bad point) I mean ok fine throw more guys at me.Then you have your ""Allies"" being not very helpful, pushing you out of cover shooting you if you ever walk to the left a bit, listening to them repeat the same 3 sentences again and again when there's nothing you can do but slowly clear them while they're being obstructive (Second bad point, if you didn't know).The thing that got to me most was not the very linear gameplay, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, or how most of the enemy AI is weak AF. What got to me was (WARNING A LITTLE SPOILER) one part of the game where you fight this lightly equppied enemies, they wear tee shirts and baggy pants with NO armour whatsoever, and you take half your magazine to kill one.... HEAVILY ARMOURED TROOPS go down in 3-6 bullets but UNARMOURED THUGS go down after you're almost out of rounds. YAY LOGIC.And that was the final straw for me, i'm still gonna complete it though (Last mission after all) but i really can't in good conscience recommend this garbage to anyone.TL;DRGameplay is bland, AI is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Story makes me want to kill myself, Voice acting is bad, and people are giving this a good review because MURICA			",164,27,1,31,31,0,16

I can't wait to see how the Revolution turns out.I want to see that one do well, as much as this one.I hope you guys please buy this, but it for your friends, help get the multiplayer going, run dedicated servers and do great things with this.Please I ask of all of you to please keep this game alive.This is very underrated, I am not disappointed playing this game.Don't buy the console versions of the game.This game on Steam has no frame rate issues, I never encountered any in single player or multiplayer.

												Homefront is nothing more than a boring but thankfully short shooting gallery. The premise of the game is actually quite good and is probably the only saving grace of the game. If you are a fan of Red Dawn than you will be extremely dissapointed as this game has a pretty decent premise but terrible execution. The story is terrible with shallow characters that will leave you with no emotional attatchment at all. Homefront tries to be a serious game but it ultimately fails . Even in its most ""emotional"" moments you really wont feel sorry for anyone. The graphics are extremely dated. Textures look terrible especially on bigger levels and the same 4 North Korean enemies are recycled throughout the game. Your allies also look extremely bad and are usually blank faced or have some ridiculous stare that was meant to show the intensity of the battle but ends up just making the player laugh. The guns are also pretty bad looking and their sounds are god awful. The voice acting is sub par as well. One of the bigger faults of this game is that it is extremely boring. The game basically boils down to killing a mass of enemies before going and pushing a switch or blowing something up. After the task is complete you run around for a bit more and to it again. Homefront is also extremely easy. The game offers no challenge on medium difficulty. I died about 3-4 times during my run of the whole campaign and that was only because I tried to ""rambo"" it a couple of times. The only ridiculous mechanic that offers even the slightest challenge is the fact that enemies are ♥♥♥♥ing sharpshooters that can hit you from across the map when they see just a sliver of your shoulder. But even with this just proning behind cover every once in a while will do the trick. This game is also extremely short. I finished the 7 chapters of the campaign in a mere 3.4 hours. That is ridiculous and should not be acceptable by any means even if the game has a good story.  Those 3,4 hours were extremel tedious and painfull. By the end of the game you are just relieved that the nightmare is almost over then Homefront decides to give you one last ♥♥♥♥♥slap across the face by sequel baiting and leaving a cliffhanger. ♥♥♥♥ off at least we deserved a proper ending but nooooo. Dont go near this ♥♥♥♥ing awful game. TLDR: Everything about homefront is terrible and you would get more enjoyment out of a cup of coffee than this game. Its not worth $19.99 and its not even worth $4.99 when its on sale. Dont touch it. Forget about it. Burn it with fire. Please run before its too late. ",134,14,2,3,8,0,4

												SINGLEPLAYERHomefront is an alright game, but I do not recommend it due to the fact that it has more cons than pros. The story is alright. But has quite a few plotholes in it. The first couple minutes though, really shows you some of the depressing things in the world of Homefront and they are actually pretty well done. The enemy AI is alright but your teammate AI is honestly pretty bad at least from my experience. Graphics are gritty looking and ugly, but the gun models, people other than important characters and dead bodies are weirdly good looking compared to the rest of the game. Especially the guns, seriously, they look REALLY good. Non of the characters are really all that likable and you play as a silent character (Which is a gripe that some people have with certain games. I for one don't mind silent characters if they are properly done, however, in Homefront it adds plotholes. Looking through iron sights is a toggle rather than a hold (You can't change it in settings). There are A LOT of invisible walls. This game is extremely linear. There are invisible walls in places where you would think it makes sense to go. When you're in calm areas where you can interact with people you move at a snails pace. Like, REALLY slow. For the most part the game is boring but it kinda ramps up when you're halfway through the campaign, especially with the last level which in my opinion is the best part of the campaign. When you're in areas with team AI, you have to wait for them to reach the end of the level for you to proceed to another area (It's probably a way that the devs made to load the next level). Also it's really easy for you to die, at least for me (Difficulty is a preference but even on easy the enemy AI were pretty unforgiving).Oh and the campaign is 4 hours long. Shorter, depending on how you play (I died a lot).Overall, I don't recommend this game. There are too many cons with this game and not enough pros. I thought almost the entire game was really boring other than the last hour or so. If you want to dive into the world of Homefront you might as well wait for the sequel, Homefront: The Revolution which is an open world game that fixes all the problems I have it this game. But if you want to, get this game when it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be honest, I didn't try the multiplayer component of this game, so take this with a grain of salt.This was my first and probably last attempt to get into a modern war FPS game due to the boring levels and level designs.EDIT: OK, maybe it'll be the last one I ever play for the SINGLE PLAYER mode.  The amount of story I slogged through was not all that interesting, the ai was dumb, going to point A to B may as well been a rail shooter, and the guns I went with just didn't feel fun to use.

												This game felt unfinished. For starters, the campaign is all of 3 hours long. And a large chunk of that 3 hours is you twiddling your thumbs waiting for the next highly scripted segment of gameplay to trigger because you as the player can't do much of anything alone. Despite supposedly being an important key figure in the rebellion (which never gets explained, not that much does), you are led by the hand the entire time and trusted to do nothing on your own. You are treated like an incompetent child. You have zero player agency. You can't even climb a ladder until the game gives you a button prompt. The game literally thinks that you are too stupid to perform even the most basic functions without instruction. I don't mind linear games, but this game is so linear that it makes the Call Of Duty franchise look like a series of expansive open world games with great player freedom. The game also suffers from horrific collision detection problems as well as physX issues, leading to many silly deaths and flat out broken sections of gameplay. The story also makes no sense, has terrible pacing, as you would expect from a 3 hour campaign, and is tonally all over the place. It has it's moments of fun, it isn't all bad, but the good moments are rare and aren’t nearly good enough to compensate for how dull and infuriating the experience is for the other 75% of the time. In all honesty, I wouldn't recommend this game at any price.   Here is my full in-depth review

												Well... how to resume that poor Call of Duty clone as fast as possible... easy!PROS:+The ""WHAT-IF"" occupation of America scenario is interesting.+Decent graphics (DX11)+Crouch, prone positions (it is rare that you have the possibility to prone in modern FPS).+Soundtrack is decent+Multiplayer mode has potential, if that's your bag!CONS:-Improbable silly story. Koreans invading not only USA but many other countries? C'mon!-Campaign playtime is VERY short (3-5 hours top, depending of difficulty level)-Scripted like hell. Lots of enemies running at you until you kill that specific RPG soldier so they stop spawning!-Lots of ""invisible walls""... and door blocking lockers until lifted up by NPC.-Your running speed is like my grandpa walking speed.-Collectibles are annoying to search as your prompted from NPC's to carry on and move on to next objective.OVERALL:That is about all that come's to mind for now and if you are slightly interested in Homefront, buy it only at a decent deal. Besides, there are plenty of wargames alternatives.RECOMMENDATION:I only recommend this game for wargames purists, that always want some more wargame and can't seem to fill their shooting needs.RATING: 5.0 / 10			",800,167,27,82,79,2,130

												Homefront is a FPS with a short campaign and a dead multiplayer. It takes place in a scenario where Korea is united and occupies the US. You might ask how? The game answers the question with supposedly superior technology, but it never shows it. The Korean towers are the only new thing the Koreans seem to bring to the fight, but with the obvious weakness at the outside, it doesn't really help to explain anything. + It looks great+ It tried to show some memorable moments. Well, at least tried.+ There are civilians+ Lots of different American rifles I love to use- Koreans apparently also often use American weapons. Thus, many weapons felt too smiliar.- You are constalty accompanied by some resistance fighters- Why is Connor leading the squad? He is nuts and annoying.- It's too short. You might need 3-5h to finish the campaign.- Plot doesn't explain how United Korea is able to occupy the US.- too linear- The memorable scenes didn't really work.The game shows potential, but it just falls short. There are better alternatives than this. But if you really want to play it, get it on a sale.Replay value: Average (too linear, nothing really special nor memorable)Rating: 5.5/10Recommendation: No			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												pros- graphics are ok- story is ok- gun mechanics are good with soundcons- u need to click on rmb to aim and click again to release it. Holding rmb to aim would help combat experience. (as in most fps)- small variety of weapons (no big deal)- short campaign (good, thanks to these cons)- jumping is a joke- way too scripted; sometimes  u have to wait other npc to climb a lader or breaching a room. U have to get in line- can not skip cutscenes or dialogues. imagine u die a lot in some areas.- worst of all: u keep getting stuck during gunfights. oh it's a chair, no it's a vase, no it's a brick, oh no it's the CORNER of a boxhad high hopes and glad the disappointment didn't last long due to campaign length.4/10			",53,14,1,5,0,0,0

												Homefront was a strange experience.I was huge into Team Fortress 2 at the time and they were giving away a copy of Metro 2033 and a hat for the Soldier class aa a pre-purchase bonus so I figured why not? It turns out I got more mileage out of the Genuine hat than either game I got out of that deal.One has to look at the media blitz surrounding this game as an indicator that when you have people dress up as the antagonists of the game at gaming conventions and events and releasing hundreds of balloons over the Golden Gate Bridge to promote it you have to wonder if the developer is putting too many of their eggs in the basket. If you can, go look up the review PlayitBogart did of Rise of the Robots to get the gist of what I'm saying.To the game itself now.Homefront was not a hot mess; it played just fine and controlled like a modern FPS should despite all the difficulties I had adjusting to the keyboard and mouse after playing shooters on consoles for almost seven years prior. A lot of the high points of the game came in the first half of the campaign showcasing the cruelty of the North Koreans by having things such as piles of dead Americans being buried en masse in a baseball field or a childs parents being shot in right in front of you as you are transported on a bus. They even briefly touched on one of your companions facing racism due to the fact he was half-Korean. Surely some attempts to invoke emotion were expected in a game touching on this subject matter....That's about the end of the positives however. Looking back I disliked this game for the lack of content it had and all the glaring flaws in how it tried to do what it did. For starters, all the main characters played out as pure sterotypes which for the purpose of this review I will refer to them as Jarhead, Girl, Target of Racism (TOR), and Father Figure.You escape from a bus and turn into Dothis McPlotdrive III as you try to meet up with Jarhead's friends to try and fight back against the Koreans who were somehow able to unite almost all of East Asia and occupy an economically crippled United States. Is your immersion broken yet? Don't worry, I was somehow able to care less about the characters in this game by the end of it all. Jarhead and Girl argue constantly as you are led through the war torn suburbs to a hidden oasis where the resistance has set up a self-sufficient hide-a-way led by Father Figure.You are then led through a night mission where you are bombarded by advertisments for actual real world companies and establishments to the point where you actualy have to fight your way through a Tiger Direct store and pass by a Hooters. I wish I was kidding. This was a design choice by the developers to try and increase the immersion but astute gamers will see this as a disturbing trend where fiction and reality break down. The same thing happened when I noticed real world ads would start appearing on billboards in Saints Row 2; it takes me out of the game and reminds me the crappy real world exists.You go through American held lands with TOR to do something in the cornfields. I think it was to find a helicopter to escort some fuel trucks for the military to use to fight against the Koreans. The game just spirals down into oblivion after this.The whole premise of the game is laughable at best anyway. You expect me to believe a small nation that refuses to feed it's populace would just somehow take over it's neighbors and confront the only real Superpower on the planet? Would this make more sense if the antagonists were Chinese as was originally planned? A change that was made because the devs were afraid of a people who are notorious for breaking copyright law like it's nothing and banning anything that portrays their nation in a bad light?The worst problem I had with this game was the fact it was obvious sequel bait. When you finally get to the climax of the game you expect to confront the main bad guy that they built up all game to, only to be blue-balled by ""We are finally turning this war around"" before the credits roll.There was no follow-up until recently with Homefront: The Revolution serving as a reboot of the series, effectively making this game pointless story wise. But hopefully developers look at it as a lesson of how much high expectations can sink a company. Kaos Studios was shuttered shortly after release and according to Wikipedia shares of THQ declined by almost a quarter, ultimately leading to the demise of THQ.Multiplayer was also a strange mix of Battlefield and Counter-strike where you fought in tug of war style battles and earned credits to purchase weapons, armor, vehicles and the like. In retrospect, it wasn't unique enough for me to continue trying to do better. I just went back to TF2 shortly after with my Genuine Hachimaki.I could only recommend this at a steep discount or as a video playthrough. Aside from that, you didn't miss much.			",31,1,0,2,2,1,6

												Homefront tells a story that not many other FPS games have told. Many games like to show the U.S. as ""the undefeatable force"" and the ""people who always save the day in the end"". In this game, you get to experience the opposite. What would happen if North Korea were to occupy America? Answer: It's not pretty.  Great simple shooter, still has a nice following, and well worth having in your collection.			",424,68,5,71,85,2,150

												The first time i played this game I was using a GTX210 with 2GB ram intel dual core, it lagged big time.Now, I am using a GTx980 with 8GB ram and i5 4th gen, this♥♥♥♥♥♥still lags.The game is poorly optimized, and the game mechanics is something that can easily make you cry.The setting is great, but the action execution is nothing but a joke. You can pass on it, as the sequel doesn't havemuch to offer either. Fun fact: If you stand right in front of an NPC while they move forward you will slid with them. Now I know other games that had the same issue, but a game released in 2011 with this is really dissapointing. ",165,17,12,11,9,4,6

												As generic as they come, Homefront is a game for lovers of the point-and-shoot variety. The story wants to be as poignant as Spec Ops: The Line. The gameplay wants to be as solid as the Call of Duty series. The visuals want to be like Battlefield 3. Unfortunately, all of those aspects fall incredible short of their ideals. The voice acting is surprisingly strong, but it completely undermined by the utterly dumb AI. Friendly NPCs block you from cover, exposing you to enemy fire. Enemies are very predictable. Difficulty is only ramped up by adding more enemies to the screen. There are a few shining moments of cinematic brilliance, like when you are first escorted as a prisoner through a typical American suburb taken over by the brutal Korean forces, but all of that great storytelling is destroyed by blocky NPC models and outdated textures. I can't speak for the multiplayer as I only played the single-player.I give this game a 4/10. It's not worth the $20 price tag, but if you pick it up from a Humble Bundle or on sale, it might be worth the measly ~4 hours it takes to complete the single-player campaign.Pros: Superb Voice ActingGreat Cinematic Moments and StorytellingCons:Outdated GraphicsClunky GameplayFrustrating NPCsDumb Enemies ",609,166,22,69,53,4,89

												So i bought this game years ago, it wouldn't launch on Server 2012 R2, and I finally got around to running Win 10 and decided to give it a try. Ignoring what a bad FPS it is, how bland the story is, the poor graphics on the higest setting, it still manages to have negative SLI scaling so many years after launch. On a GTX 980 it gets about 30 fps on the higest setting with AA turned off, with SLI its 10-20 fps with constant stuttering. And even wrose (or perhaps a redeeming factor) is that single player campaign is maybe 3 or 4 hours long. I'm not even sure how I have 12 hours played, I can only assume it crashed years ago and steam still thought it was running. Its not even worth $5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OK while it lasted.  It took me five hours to complete the game and I tend to take my time.  Not that you really get a chance to do that in this game.  It is basically non-stop action while it lasts.  If you like that you will like the game.  The story and characters do not leave any impression.  Just there to move the action along.Overall, I would say do not buy unless you get it for a couple bucks or in a bundle for cheap.  The game is short.  There is zero replay value.  It is on rails which is slightly noticable in say COD but very noticible in this title.  There are a bunch of irratating things I would blame on poor programming.  Such as getting entangled with your AI support, not moving because their is some object you can not see but is seemingly too high for you to walk over, AI enemies fire and explosions affecting  only you, etc.  At one point I was waiting for my AI team to open a door so we could move forward but we were stuck for some reason.  I spent a few minutes running around trying to see if there was something needed that I missed.  It turns out, the AI engineer guy was stuck on something outside and I had to walk into him a few times to free him and then he joined us at the door inside and we moved forward.So, not the worst but no where near the best.

												I wouldn't go over a 6 for this game as it is irrefutably one of the best storylines that the gaming universe has seen, muddled up in too many cliche scenes and very Call-of-Duty Style Gameplay. I find it as one of those games you can only barely play. Only Just captured my intelligence through many previews and lead-ups to the game. Multiplayer on the other hand does deserve a little ,if any, praise for its constructive potential and the use of in-game credits to buy power-ups, vehicles, ammo, etc. It is a fun game for the first few hours, then becomes boring quickly, Hardly worth anything over $30. I made a mistake, I paid the full price of the game and didn't wait for the game to be on sale.Unfortuantly, my PC didn't run the game at max settings. I'll play it again when I get a new monster PC.6/10			",185,29,8,13,9,2,37

												I wouldn't imagine a game built so strongly around Republican fantasises would be so eager to take away my guns. Awkward weapon changes happen every scene, and the main character can't carry more than 90 rounds for any one rifle, and none of the ammo is compatible with the fancy guns you'll occasionally pick up. The action is mediocre, the plot is perhaps more interesting than I would have guessed. The interaction with NPC squadmates is hamfisted, and most of the characters are unlikable. I do have to give it credit for not being as racist or terrible as I had expected. Bonus points for the TigerDirect product placement. You probably already own this game as part of a THQ bundle pack. Otherwise, I wouldn't buy it.			",574,130,6,48,35,2,70

												I was going to make a list of games less linear than Homefront, but since I started with ""Bowling,"" I decided that was going to be too long of a list.The general rule of the game is that if you didn't get a prompt onscreen to do something, or weren't specifically told to do something by another character, it's not the right thing to do. You don't need to worry about that though, since if it's not exactly what the game just told you to do, it's not going to allow you to do it. Invisible walls are everywhere, and don't ever try to walk ahead of a scripted character or the game will stop until you get back where it told you to be.			",2439,766,93,291,276,30,350

												This is for the campaign: Yes, my 0.6 hours of it.No. Nononononononononono.The most BROKEN piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I've ever seen. I mean right at the start, during the crash scene, Connor tells you to pick up the gun (which assume was the gun I could see during the no-control portion). So you stand up and *poof* it's gone. Restart the game? Sure. I restarted, had to sit through the WHOLE bus ride again just for it to not work. again. I tried ONCE more and instead of hitting ""W"" for forward, I accidentally held ""S"" and OOPS, out the back of the bus I went. I went and looked it up and this appears to be a VERY common issue, so campaign-wise I give this a solid 0/10. Why? Cause I couldn't play it.Multiplayer: Yeah.... I just couldn't care less.If this game is getting a sequel (which is what I've heard), count me out. Nothing is worth potentially going through this again.			",79,10,0,17,7,0,17

However there were some flaws with it such as slowish gameplay, shorter story, and very very limited ammo (the main character decides to only hold a few clips throughout the story).

Then you can run the game, then re-update your physX			",190,19,3,22,8,1,27

												When you decide to look away from the broken menus and the rather.. Questionable theme of the entire game, then it opens up to what feels like a very, very, very long tutorial. Every level feels like a tutorial, every objective feels arbitrary and pointless, and even when you try and freshen things up by doing something even vaguely interesting, like not crawling from cover to cover, but actually fight the enemies, you are immediately punished for it. These punishments come in the form of invisble walls, or enemies immediately dropping anything they have in their hands to all target you.Other than these issues, the game likes to throw overly long 'interactive' cutscenes at you, no doubt hoping to force you into loving it's cardboard cutout characters. As soon as you start up level 2, you're actually stuck for about 20 minutes waiting for NPC's to carry out their scripted conversations of absolutely no consequence, with your objective being 'Follow'. If you want a good shooter, don't pick this. The gameplay is 'meh' while you're forced to spend way too long on doing absolutely nothing but watching men milk goats, and listen to people talking about nothing at all.3/7			",483,73,5,42,26,3,60

												Solid Shooter Formula, Nothing too exciting or new as far as gameplay goes except the temporary moments where the Goliath is controlled, but a good ride all the way through the singleplayer.The only grips I had with are the length of the Single Player campaign (extremely short) and the Ally AI will irritate you with their incompetance at times.

												Loved this for Xbox360Loved the campaignLoved the multiplayerIf the multiplayer looks half-fun to you ( and I promise it is ) pick it up and find a server. Surprisingly there still are a few that have players.Honestly I was surprised the PvP didn't catch on when this game released and am sad that Homefront the Revolution will not have this games amazing PvP.Overall its still a pretty rockin' game 8.5/10P.S. the PhysX thing whne you are running the game for the first time, Homefront scans for a file that I guess got altered sicne its release in PhysX, this can be solved by uninstalling your current version of PhysX going to your steam/steamapps/common/HOMEFRONT/redist/ and installing PhysX from there. Then you can run the game, then re-update your physX			",190,19,3,22,8,1,27

												I missed out of the MP so I can not say anything about it. It took me around 2 - 3 hours to finish the game (none stop playing) The game feels like a COD game, the fighting was fast and fun, the maps/levels were fine but they could of done a bit more with them. The NPC sometimes took 20 secs or so to get moving after they stopped at a checkpoint of some sort. They would push the player out of the way if they got to close and were invincible, that was fine with the main characters but with the no named NPC's they should die if they got shot and respawned or something behind.But I do recommend this game, WAIT FOR A SALE but I do recommend it.

			Views: 31		

			LOVE MUSIC? - GRAB SOME GREAT MUSIC HERE: http://paradisedecay.bandcamp.com/ I take a quick look @ 'Homefront' The year is 2027.		

 A once proud America has fallen, her infrastructure shattered and military in disarray. Crippled by a devastating EMP strike, the USA is powerless to resist the ever expanding occupation of a savage, nuclear armed Greater Korean Republic. Abandoned by her former allies, the United States is a bleak landscape of walled towns and abandoned suburbs. This is a police state where high school stadiums have become detention centers, and shopping malls shelter armored attack vehicles. A once-free people are now prisoners… or collaborators… or revolutionaries. Join the Resistance, stand united and fight for freedom against an overwhelming military force in Homefront’s gripping single player campaign penned by John Milius (Apocalypse Now, Red Dawn). Stand alongside a cast of memorable characters as an emotional plot unfolds in this terrifyingly plausible near-future world. Experience visceral, cinematic first-person shooter action as you fight your way across Occupied USA using guerrilla tactics, and commandeer military vehicles and advanced drone technology to defeat the enemy.

												I wanted to like this game... This is a review of the campaign. I can say this: The graphics are good, it runs well, the story is believable (almost), and it's certainly action packed, full of big explosions. But sadly it's let down by far too many things for me to reccomend it:First and foremost is that I feel so bored after completing the campaign that the very idea of even trying multiplayer makes me feel like I should do something more productive with my time... Pull a lump of wax out of my ear, pick my nose, or scratch my nuts or something...  You just play ""follow the leader"" for 90% of the campaign. Deviating from the leaders course is unrewarding/pointless, and in some cases causes the mission to restart.4 hours to complete, and the first 3 hours was at best: ""meh"". The final hour of gameplay I was sort of starting to enjoy it. Stockholm syndrome maybe. Then it was over.Lacklustre animations, people sliding sideways without their feet moving, or running but not going anywhere (enemy soldier stuck at the top of the stairs for instance), wheels on vehicles that turn too slowly for the speed the vehicle is moving at...Special effects from two different games: explosions and the resulting fireballs look brilliant. Get stuck in an area where most of the scenery is on fire though and it's a different story... Running through a burning shop I noticed ""fires"" that looked like they came straight out of a game from 15 years ago.Ambient occlusion? Turn it off, it looks like lego land smoke on everything that gets close to another surface. Turning it off didn't make a noticeable difference to the general look of the game, but did get rid of the horrible blocky smoke around everything.All the guns handle the same with nothing to distinguish them besides the scope stuck on top (of which you can choose 3 varieties of acog scope, and 3 varieties of red dot sight). Whether it be an SMG, LMG or assault rifle; recoil is non existant (with the exception of the two sniper rifles, but they auto center after each shot making the recoil pretty much pointless on them).There's a heli flying section in the game that is absolutely dire, it shouldn't be in the game at all but part of the story is you're a heli pilot... Unfortunately whoever designed the heli section of the game had absolutely no idea of what a helicopter actually is... You basically fly a magical hovering cannon that can bounce off everything, including cliffs, trucks, enemy tanks etc. You can point the nose of the heli at the ground and not go anywhere...Then there's bugs, invisible walls, not being able to walk through certain doors when they're open because you have to wait for the NPCs to go through first and that sort of rubbish.Friendly NPCs who are totally invincible, soaking up hundreds of rounds of ammo and eating a few grenades to boot without so much as stumbling.The stealth sections are atrocious, and the AI is pretty much non existant. My first warning of this was when I nearly tripped over an enemy soldier after running upstairs, but he didn't notice me because apparenlty he was stone deaf and for some reason was inspecting the paintwork on a door by pressing his nose against it... I couldn't shoot him, I couldn't even raise my gun (maybe your character pitied the simple minded fool or something). Then a friendly npc walks up behind him, chatting casually, and strangles him in 1 second flat.She then looks all sad before saying ""It never gets any easier"". I dunno love, that vulcan nerve pinch shiz you just pulled on that soldier looked pretty damn easy to me.The sad truth is it literally couldn't be any easier: You can literally walk around in the open in broad daylight and they won't notice you unless you are directly in front of them.One time a friendly NPC (yeah, same one) went to kill a guard, in plain view of 3 other guards and a couple of prisoners, they didn't even blink. I shot someone on a tower with a silenced sniper rifle and the mission ended because I took the shot 2 seconds before I was told to. 2nd attempt, friendly NPC goes to kill the guard, I hide behind a tractor with my team until I'm told to take the shot, mission ended for no apparent reason. 3rd attempt, I stood in front of the tractor in the open between the friendly NPC and the 3 guards who don't care about their friend being choked to death behind me. Still standing in front of them I shoot the guy in the tower. Nobody cares, the mission is allowed to go on.It doesn't feel like it's finished. BF3 in beta was a more polished experience than this tripe. Though you can see the influences of other games, the one that really stands out is CoD. This game tries so hard to be CoD, that it's almost as bad as a CoD game. CoD and Half Life had a baby, CoD smothered the baby. Half Life decided that things weren't working out and scarpered, but then CoD decided to keep and raise the afterbirth. Homefront, the mouldy placenta of FPS games is a casual shooter. Are you a casual? If you've read this far I doubt it. If you're really desperate for another generic CoD clone this might keep you entertained briefly... If you want a game that has real substance and lasting replayability, look elsewhere because this is duller than dishwater.TLDR: Yet another generic, run of the mill CoD clone that was a chore to play... If you've got 4 hours to waste and it's 75% off, do yourself a favour and still don't buy it. Unless you're a CoD fanboy, in which case you'll probably love it. Sad, deluded fool that you are.

												A game that attempts to hide its own glaring limitations and flaws by setting a fast action pace, yet comes off as feeling emotionally manipulative and falls flat at every level.

												Starting off with the obvious flaws this game has: The singleplayer campaign is short , it is plagued with in-game advertising for many early sections, many of the animations are stuttery, and a lot of the combat feels like a generic COD clone.That being said, this game does have it's merits. The concept of itself is both brilliantly created and masterfully implimented as the story, like ""Freedom Fighters"" shows a conflict outside of the generic us vs arabs conflict, and puts the war on american soil in the defensive. The explanation is deep and intricate, and in many ways almost feasible, but even there isn't where this game truly shines.The game juxtapositions the ideals of two of your partners, emotional vs mechanical, against each other in a way that makes the player question his actions. It also forces him to experience the backlash of ""heroic actions"" as negative effects most games leave out. Consequences for actions is a recurrant theme, and is artfully displayed within.

												Bad plot devices due to bad writing meets poor programing and clunky controls. Oh and bad voiceover acting too. Let's recap the first hour for me. Get rescued from concentration camp by insurgent forces, got through hell to get away...have to wait for AI to open every single door, because they have the majic kick the door in ability.Get stuck on wall, because I walked into it. Reload checkpoint...move forward.Hail of gunfire yet I can here screaming childGrenade magically appears next to me, die. Lose ability to walk at normal pace so that I can hear about the insurgent camp. regain when devs are through boring me. Bounce off open door, open staircase and several othe invisible objects until my team goes ahead of me through them. Devs must be implying that my character has a stong sense of the ""...last out"" mentality.Connor has moment of hatred against invading army, does something stupid while giving a b-movie voice over. Grenade magically appears next to me, die.Magically teleport several feet forward upon reload. Apparantly dying=progress in this game.Grenade magically appears next to me, die.Lose ability to walk or use weapon so that female can slit the throat of enemy gaurd convieniently staring at an exit door...to a balcony with no stairs. Apparently what the devs are saying is that a female could only kill the dumbest guard in history. How sexist. It would apear that they also have a shakey understanding of firecodes.Grenade magically appears next to me, die.Blow the living daylights out of enemy forces using Goliath targeting system. Experience is enjoyable exept that each time I use its targeting system it jumps into my pocket and puts a gun into my hands. Multiple targets ensure the joy of repeatedly pressing the 4 key to bring it back up for use..this creates palpable tension.Several grenades appear around me. Whilst I try to run away Connor jumps in front of me...no through me. So that I can shield the team from the blast of grenade with my crotch. The plan worked, I die, but Connor lives on.Buy the game for one reasone (when it is on mega sale of course) it's so bad that it is actually fun to make fun of.			",144,14,2,15,6,0,8

												This game doesn't feel right. The Story—North Koreans sucessfully invade and occupy the US of A—could be a wonderful setup for an excellent B-Movie style plot but personally I don't care much about any of the characters. At least the pilot guy I'm playing. The NPCs (the Goliath drone, too) just stand in the way, slow me down, won't let me open any door by myself and block the frame after kicking down the door, and so on and so on…What I like:• The graphics—not top notch anymore and probably never were, but the game looks cohesive in a good way;• Beeing able to stand, crouch and prone is good—switching between crouching and standing is good for getting in and out of cover fast, and to prone helped me in some tough scenes;• The setup of the story.What I do not like:• Guys, girls and drones standing in the way, blocking my view and blocking my way;• Doors magically closing behind me;• The weapons' sounds;• Somehow I feel small in this game. The POV is like everyone is at least one head taller than ""me"".• The story.I've read the multiplayer-part of this game is decent, but beeing almost a pure single player I can't judge. For SPs like me I can not recommend this game.			",560,224,12,87,53,7,101

												Homefront Review (Spoiler Free)(Story)In the near future, global crises force countries to make aggressive decisions about their survival.  North Korea ends up coming out on top and once it solidifies its presence in Europe and Asia, it turns to North America.  The NK's invade from the West and life becomes hell for the average U.S. citizen.  You play a member of the resistance movement and are quickly hurled into the fight to break the NK's hold on the U.S.(Gameplay)Homefront is an FPS with rechargeable health, much like COD4.  There is no cover system though you can peak and lean once you aim down sights.  You can carry several weapons plus equipment and pick up weapons on the ground.  Most of the time you will be doing on-foot shooting however there are a few land and air vehicular segments.  You will usually fight with a team of resistance members, though do not expect much in terms AI competency.  Enemies on the other hand show average to below average intelligence.  Other than a few set moments, it's one shooting gallery after another, just at various times of day.  My favorite moment in the game is when you are given the ability to direct an unmanned rover and use it to clear your way through a neighborhood.  Most will complete the game in under three (that's right, 3) hours making this game a hard sell, especially with stronger competitors out there.  Multiplayer tries to mimic Battlefield style gameplay with vehicles, gadgets, and large maps but there are not many people except fans playing anymore.    (Design)The game looks and sounds decent.  As others have said, the opening sequence sets the stage for an epic game.  There are many good looking set piece moments, but they are marred by short levels and average gameplay.  Dialogue feels okay though nothing is worth quoting.(Final Comments)I believe the multiplayer component of this game was the primary focus during its creation.  Unfortunately it could not compete with Battlefield and instead, players are left with an average single player.  With a short campaign experience devoid of replayability and a relatively empty multiplayer, I do not recommend Homefront.  Hopefully the sequel fares better.			",114,8,1,6,3,1,8

												-Guns have no kick whatsoever, enemies are bullet-sponges - gunplay in general feels weak.-Story is linear, not in the least stimulating, and feels incredibly contrived. -Graphics are passible but look aged - which given the age of the game isn't surprising. However, other games from the time have aged much better (Bad Company 2 for example, is a year older but looks much better IMO). -However, on the positive side - the campaign is only 4 hours long and I paid $0.98 for this at Walmart. If you can get it for less than $5 (I almost begrudged the $1.13 I paid for it, taxes in), you might find something to like here. Although the multiplayer is dead, if it's cheap enough, the campaign MIGHT be worth it to you. As PC Gamer's Andy Chalk so accurately put it - this is essentially the video game equivalent of Sharknado - if that's your thing, go ahead and take a look. Otherwise stay clear.-on the plus side however, the sequel looks to be an entirely different genre of shooter. One that it looks like I could enjoy-			",106,7,0,7,5,0,13

												Single player campaign felt canned, but I enjoyed the multiplayer. I thought the campaign had a good story but was EXTREMELY linear. The developer could've done so much more with what the writers had done. Perhaps open world?In particular, I enjoyed the point-based, multiplayer reward system that allowed players to purchase air strikes, drones, weapons, or vehicles.I also enjoyed the map system that unlocked new parts of the map, depending on which team captured objectives.Overall, it wasn't a great shooter, but it was good and offered a few different features than most other FPS.

												Soooo...Homefront, homefront. This is kinda an odd game to speak, I mean it's not a very good game but nor is it bad. Originally as many recall this game was developed by THQ before they went bankrupt, after which they sold the rights to the developers of Crysis and the game was back on steam (after the companus bankrupcy it was removed from steam for some odd reason)So, Homefront takes place in the far future where the leader of North Korea is dead, his son took over and somehow managed to unify the North and South Korea (wishful thinking much?), then they somehow take over Japan and China. While this is going on the US is being kicked around like a Juarez ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, going bankrupt and losing it's major wars in the middle east (Oh hey, George Bushes worst dream came true, America no longer having a big♥♥♥♥♥♥, being hit by a deadly bird flu an etc. All this leaves America crippled and North Korea rolls in an takes ground, an it's up to the glorious resistance to save America an all it's Apple pie/Burger king eating citizens from the evil Korean cooking.Now, if you read trough this synopsis and haven't blown your brains out, then congrats you're the small part of us squishy humans that likes using their brain thingies. Yes, this script reads like something a basement dwelling paranoid whackjob would write and then put on youtube, because it is. The script for this game was writen by John Millius, the same clown who wrote Red Dawn -frankly, you'd think after THAT stink burger someone would take away his writing pen-, and he pretty much brings the same jingoism here as he did in Red Dawn. To make it short, in Miliuse's eyes anyone who isn't American is apperantly a equivilent of a Nazi, because as in Red Dawn, the Koreans in this game do everything except twirlling moustache's or having swastikas. It's clear they are trying to make you hate these guys with every cheap way possible, which just comes off as juvenile and laughable (or maybe I really don't care 'cause I'm not American an the plot to this game is seven layer cakes of stupid)Anyway, let's forget the stupid plot and speak about the gameplay itself. Aaaan...there isn't much to say really, the game is your standart Modern Military shooter, if you played enough CoD you pretty much got this in the bag. The game can be clocked out in four hours tops (if you don't die that often) and after that there's an abrupt end for the upcoming sequel (which I honestly wanna see, it kinda seems more promising than this game.) The weapons are standart, the characters are all bland as hell, you are silent and actually don't have the ability to open doors for some unknow reason.Honestly, I'd say the real best part of this game is the multiplayer itself. It has 32 players limit, it def feels more like a Bad Company 2 or something Battlefield esque, rather than CoD arena/twitch reflexes shooting. There's some fun maps and mods, and it really feels like you're on a battle.Now, can I recommend this game?  Well, I'd say you should only buy it on sales and just for the multiplayer itself, because the single player isn't really worth it.			",205,33,0,27,12,2,27

												tl;dr: A bunch of great ideas with poor execution: the game. This game isn't really worth the $20 asking price. Campaign is three hours long on a good day, and the mulitplayer is a bland, unpopulated experience. For the same price you can buy battlefield 3 or 4 on Origin, which outclass this game in just about every aspect. Don't waste your time here.What it does right: I was hyped as hell when this first showed up, and the amount of advertisement and weird♥♥♥♥♥♥they did at E3 that year really made me want to buy it. The setting is a great idea. I wish more shooters would stray away from the modern military shooter that we're so used to by now and do things like this. However, when the reviews started coming out I'd figure I'd try it once it dropped in price... four years later.The mechanics work, I guess. It's nothing special, other than maybe getting to use the Goliath to shoot rockets at enemies that are giving you a hard time. None of the guns feel bad to use, and they have a good amount of punch on enemies, but at the same time they do feel kinda flimsy. For a shooter that came out in 2011, it works. It's nothing special but it's not like the mechanics of the game are terrible.A few of the set pieces were pretty cool, but those were a mix between laughable and alright. None of it felt particularly epic, but again, it served its purpose.What it does wrong: Oh boy where to start. I guess we can start with the singleplayer. It's overly linear. I don't mean the good kind of linear like Metro 2033 or Killzone. I mean straight out of call of duty corridoor nose-leading. If you go in any direction other than which one the game wants you to go, you'll run face first into an invisible wall. It doesn't matter if you just passed through that open door ten seconds ago, you go one way and one way only. And you can tell the designating fighting zones from the talking corridors by the random stacks of chest-high cover littered around. It's painfully obvious that this game doesn't really want you to go out on your own or do anything other than move from cover to cover shooting bad guys. There is no variety to any of it.The graphics also haven't aged well. I don't think they were even that great at the time. I think Half Life 2 looks better and it came out seven years before. The color scheme is bland and uninteresting, and you can't interact with anything other than picking up guns. Even your teammates have to open doors for you like this was a ps2 ww2 shooter.The campaign is, in its entirety, maybe three hours long if you stop to look at the scenery once in a while. I beat it in two and a half. It isn't even a good three hours either. I was actually kinda thankful it wasn't longer, otherwise I might not have gotten through it. None of your npc companions are even remotely interesting and they don't bother to characterize any of them beyond very basic traits. You have no reason to be invested in any of it, as they just sling you into the action three minutes into it with barely any explanation. This doesn't change the further you get into it, either. Only after following these rebels for an hour and a half or so do they finally tell me in the form of an off-hand comment that they needed me to fly a helicopter for them. You think they would have taken the time to brief the pilot on that important detail, or at least asked if he could fly a helicopter and wasn't just a jet pilot or something. The most motivation you get is the objective marker. No overall reason behind it, or important motive, just follow the arrow. Sure, I want to liberate the home of the free just as much as anyone, but blindly following the first couple of idiots that almost kill me in a car crash doesn't seem like it's the most solid of motivations.And another thing, I'm getting really tired of silent protagonists. It worked in games like Dead Space because Isaac was completely alone, and didn't need to talk to anyone most of the time, but here? There are usually three other people that need to be interacted with in combat situations. Games like Far Cry 3 and Spec Ops: The Line have completely destroyed the notion that video game protagonists are better silent. I have no interest in Jacobs like I did Jason. Being invested in your character as a person goes a long way into being better invested in the game overall. This game did nothing towards this and ended up being bland and forgettable.One last little rant before I get to the multiplayer: North Korea? Really? The only reason anyone ever gives them any respect is because they're allies with China. Never would a tiny, economically weak nation like North Korea ever be able to hold as much land as we are led to believe, or be able to invade and occupy the nation with the world's strongest military, even while under economic collapse.  The logistics of such things are simply impossible for North Korea, even if they did have the military size they say they do, which is most likely a lie. As much as I give battlefield 4's singleplayer♥♥♥♥♥♥ it at least had a believable scenario. Plus North Korean soldiers using Colt, Bushmaster, and Kriss USA firearms (All American-based firearm companies if you didn't know)? Did they even bother to do any research into this matter? Now for the Multiplayer: They tried to add some unique features like battlepoints to build up like killstreaks, using this money to spawn into vehicles and use special weapons. I like this better than cod's killstreak system, since it allows you to buy things even if you're not doing that well, but I still don't like it that much. First, just about every class gets a rocket launcher, and you can buy it after one kill. This is not good game design. Vehicles are pretty much useless beyond a quick kill or two if you find a group of enemies that knows what they're doing. Vehicles are pretty much instant kills on infantry too, so that's annoying, and you can't even use environmental ques to tell where they are like you might in battlefield, where you might hear it coming or see it firing on the minimap. I think it did show up on the minimap, but I never saw it before one killed me.It's got the standard setup for multiplayer unlocking systems. Get kills and unlock guns. I didn't play enough to unlock anything, but I never felt like using anything other than the first class was really necessary. I didn't see much variety in the enemies either, but then again the killcam gives you absolutely no information other than where the person who killed you was at. Since just about every class gets a rocket launcher, and sniping is pretty pointless on smaller maps imo, there didn't seem to be much variety to be had. I played a few games and there wasn't much exciting going on. The maps are too big for there to be large chunks of action, and I doubt that's ever going to change with the player counts as they are. Other games do everything so much better. Overall, this game is nothing but all of the stereotypical elements of first person shooters from 2011. It seems like a lazy attempt to pull away customers from cod's fanbase, and even then, it doesn't do anything better than call of duty, it just imitates it in a different setting. If this game had come out on the ps2 seven years before, then I think it might have been a lot better received. As it is now, that's kinda what it feels like: a generic ww2 shooter from the ps2 made for a later generation. There's nothing special about it other than its setting. The multiplayer is bland, the singleplayer is forgettable, and the entire thing is nothing but a cynical attempt at checkboxing fps elements to try to bring in the cod crowd.If you read this far and are still thinking about buying the game, please don't. I can not in good conscience recommend this game to anyone when battlefield 4, an infinitely better experience, is the exact same price. Buy that game for a much better fps experience.

												This game doesn't feel right. The Story—North Koreans sucessfully invade and occupy the US of A—could be a wonderful setup for an excellent B-Movie style plot but personally I don't care much about any of the characters. At least the pilot guy I'm playing. The NPCs (the Goliath drone, too) just stand in the way, slow me down, won't let me open any door by myself and block the frame after kicking down the door, and so on and so on…What I like:• The graphics—not top notch anymore and probably never were, but the game looks cohesive in a good way;• Beeing able to stand, crouch and prone is good—switching between crouching and standing is good for getting in and out of cover fast, and to prone helped me in some tough scenes;• The setup of the story.What I do not like:• Guys, girls and drones standing in the way, blocking my view and blocking my way;• Doors magically closing behind me;• The weapons' sounds;• Somehow I feel small in this game. The POV is like everyone is at least one head taller than ""me"".• The story.I've read the multiplayer-part of this game is decent, but beeing almost a pure single player I can't judge. For SPs like me I can not recommend this game.			",560,224,12,87,53,7,101

												Homefront Review (Spoiler Free)(Story)In the near future, global crises force countries to make aggressive decisions about their survival.  North Korea ends up coming out on top and once it solidifies its presence in Europe and Asia, it turns to North America.  The NK's invade from the West and life becomes hell for the average U.S. citizen.  You play a member of the resistance movement and are quickly hurled into the fight to break the NK's hold on the U.S.(Gameplay)Homefront is an FPS with rechargeable health, much like COD4.  There is no cover system though you can peak and lean once you aim down sights.  You can carry several weapons plus equipment and pick up weapons on the ground.  Most of the time you will be doing on-foot shooting however there are a few land and air vehicular segments.  You will usually fight with a team of resistance members, though do not expect much in terms AI competency.  Enemies on the other hand show average to below average intelligence.  Other than a few set moments, it's one shooting gallery after another, just at various times of day.  My favorite moment in the game is when you are given the ability to direct an unmanned rover and use it to clear your way through a neighborhood.

												HomeFront, is an interesting game. The story and tight narrative really hold the action together almost like the quality FPS's from developer valve. Kaos Studios has done something that the choked sea of call of duty clones has sorely needed in the FPS market, originality. This game is dripping with atmosphere thanks to its well thought out and executed graphical design and the games excellent pacing. You never feel ovewhelmed, but you are always on your toes. This game is a winner for me, the downside is its short, but honestly what game is not now adays? Its about 5 hours long which may♥♥♥♥♥♥people off but the story is so well done and the game play is paced and designed so well that I can't believe people would turn this one down. The multiplayer is excellent, and the single player is a very well crafted story to which I look forward to returning to in the next game of the series {hopefully} This game deserves your dollars, its only 50 dollars.

												It's honestly a good game. The single player is fun and challenging. You fight alongside a loosing rebellion to resist the korean occupation of America in a near future scenario. The plot becomes less ridiculous and more frighteningly surreal as you learn about all the events leading up to occupation through news papers you find lying around the levels. Enemy AI is nothing special but challenging enough. Some levels are garbage though (like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stealth level with no action that you have to crawl through), and the story parts are slow and can't be skipped.The multiplayer is fun too, with progression/unlockables like CoD or BF, and has its own unique  feel to it, which is refreshing for people looking to take time away from the big names. BUT the movement needs patching, it's easy to get caught on stupid things like stones on the ground as big as your foot, and the weapons need rebalancing. The accuracy is a big issue, and the sniper rifle almost feels mandato			",273,17,4,23,7,2,24

												This is basicallly a multiplayer with a tagged on single player mode of about 4ish hours. Despite the short length it's not a bad game if you can get past the awkward controls, the annoying (to me) NPCs, stupid AI. Buy it on sale only it is not worth the full price. Good for killing a few hours and you don't want anything too taxing.			",240,155,4,40,38,1,35

												Short but sweet. Hope there is a sequel to this as the story is pretty good and gameplay enjoyable. Its more of a movie than a game and your character is just a witness to the main storyline that follows an american resistance group. 7.4/10			",217,39,4,34,5,0,16

												Your character is slow, limited, and load-outs are barely enough and difficult to refill.  Game allows NPC to shoot through materials that will block your shots.  NPCs throw grenades at you and are usually accurate while yours take weird flights and often miss the intended location.  Hate not having save-game available but having the check-point system is tedious and awkward at the higher settings.  Limited landscapes restrict the freedom of movement for flanking and force the player into kill-zones where swarming attacks are typical.  Compared to STALKER, SoC, this is inflexible and player input seems to be altered to make it more difficult to control and access anything.  Wouldn't have bought this game if I had known about the custom key alterations as opposed to a better NPC program.    3 out of 5 stars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Homefront is a bland game.The campaign's theme is great and originally what made me interested in the game, but the gameplay consists mostly of running through corridors and following AI buddies onsiderably slower than you. And you know how in regular FPS's you start off with meager equipment and get more and stronger toys throughout the game? Homefront bizarrely does the reverse. It gradually strips away your best guns and gimmicks and mission by mission turns the game more from a semi-interesting FPS to a run-to-the-mill shootmans. Thankfully you won't have to suffer long because the campaign is super short. You can easily blitz through it in five or so hours on normal difficulty.Multiplayer is dead to no-one's surprise.Skip this game and look forward to Homefront 2: Revolution instead. Coming in 2016 from Dambuster Studios and Deep Silver (latter being the guys who bought the publishers of this first Homefront, THQ).			",191,25,4,14,9,1,32

												The Gist:Set in a post WW III America, occupied by North Korean, this game came out in the heyday of CoD: Modernwarfare. Though it rang many of the bells of the direct competitor, it also fell short in many regards the former did. Ultimately a severely mediocre game which did not manage to dethrone any other game.The Pros:-Good graphics and a good visual presentation over all.-A not too overused setting (at the time anyways).-The multiplayer acutally set itself aside quite well from its competition.The Cons:-First the worst: the movement in this game feels terrible. Described as ""floaty"" and ""unresponsive"" by reviewers, when it first came out, it displays all that can go wrong with a CoD-esque game. You move at a literal snail's pace - try to sprint and your unathletic avatar give up after five meters.-On top of the former, in all the ingame cutscenes (and there are plenty, dragging out the expierence) you move even slower, forced to endure unskippable, cammy at best but mostly boring text.-Some sad technical shortcomings, FOV is very narrow, some sound bugs.-The story meanders between shallow and melodramatic, a short and unsatisfying bore.-Though interesting at the time, the multiplayer is dead now.-There is an unjustified amount of expensive DLC, splitting the community (not that there is anything like that anymore).

												not worth the hassle really. Ive tried playing this but it dosent run very well on my system for some reason. i easily have enough spec on my pc to play this game but no matter even if i put every detail down to low quality i still only max out at 30 fps. it runs no better on very low options than at high quality. Im getting killed far too many times because of the crazy lag trying to play it. its really frustrating in the middle of a chapter having to go back to the main menu several times trying options to get it to run smoother. ive tried replaying every chapter a few times but its running no better!Its a shame because the actual game would not be that bad, not a classic but definitley would not be bad.  its a far fetched story but entertaining enough. As graphics go its quite very good in my opinion, very athmospheric at dusk running through abandoned destroyed american towns and seeing the snow capped rockies in the distant. Gun play would be ok too only im struggling because of the low fps going from 30 fps one minute to 10 fps the next.Its also far too linear and sometimes your teammates get in your way and you cannot move leaving a north korean to pump you with bullets.Good points.GraphicsEntertaining enough storyBad Points.runs poorly on my systemStory far too shorttoo linearPure awkward to move sometimes, teammates getting in way, clumsy.All in All i couldnt really recommend this game, because it just wont run for me. I have Battlefield 4, which is a game that demands far more on a system than homefront and it still runs better for me! ",59,9,1,6,9,0,4

Posted: January 7, 2016
												So, first off, I should say that I bought this game purely for the single-player experience, and can't really comment on the multiplayer.  I gather there isn't much of a multiplayer community to speak of, so I just didn't bother.My ""thumbs down"" rating is based largely on the $19.99 standard price, which is NOT what I paid for the game, fortunately.  This game is in no way, shape, or form worth $19.99.  Instead, I paid about $5, which is what I'd say is a fair price for the game in terms of the quality of gameplay and amount of entertainment you get, compared to other games out there.  I went into this game, having paid my $5, looking for basically a diverting shooting gallery, and I got exactly that, so I'm perfectly satisfied with my purchase.  But, again, I wouldn't pay just shy of $20 for it.  As for why, read on.The graphics are...eh, fine.  I'm not really a graphics snob, so that's not a big deal to me.  They ran fine at max settings on my 6-year-old computer, which makes sense, considering the game came out...5 years ago.  The visuals themseles aren't up to snuff for a AAA title, but then I don't think this game could claim to be a AAA title.  Gameplay attempts to be similar to your basic Call of Duty game, with you as one of 4-5 resistance fighters in a United States under occupation by North Korea.  The game tries to make this ludicrous scenario seem reasonably plausible.  It doesn't really matter who they are, though.  They're the bad guys who've taken over the good ol' US of A, and it's up to you to shoot them in the face and do...pretty much everything else.  Your character, I think, is named Jackson or something, but he might as well be Ramirez from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.  (""Ramirez!  Do [task]!"")Movement is kind of clunky, and the gunplay isn't all that satisfying.  Sound design for the guns is passable, but they tend to have this sort of ""clanky"" quality to them.  There's probably, like, 10 different common firearms you can pick up, with 2-3 rocket launchers and such, but they all felt mostly the same to me.  There are some missions where you control this or that vehicle or assign this or that target to some mobile bringer-of-death (e.g. calling in a fire mission), but the bulk of the game is what you'd expect it to be: you running around shooting dudes.Voice acting is nothing special, and you don't end up really caring about the characters.  No surprise there.  There aren't any real cutscenes to speak of, other than the occasional mission interlude where your characters talk a bit before you can equip your gun and shoot stuff.  You get loading screens with the ""Voice of America"" providing a bit of context for the next mission.  Basically, if you want to play ""Red Dawn: The Game"" this is about as close as you'll get.  And for that, it's kinda fun, but it's not particularly polished.			",140,37,1,15,11,4,41

												A mechanical facsimilie of Call of Duty set against a surprisingly novel backdrop, but released at a time when appetite for cookie-cutter corridor shooters was already declining. While it's a technically sound shooter with decent artwork and design, and a few memorable scripted moments sprinkled in, it's painfully formulaic; if you're a fan of Call of Duty, it'll seem like a less interesting knock-off. If you're tired of Call of Duty, this won't do anything to relieve your fatigue. If you hate Call of Duty, this won't do anything to win you over. The developers clearly believed in their project, but one can't help but wonder if their efforts might have been better spent elsewhere.Overall: 3.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game doesn't feel right. The Story—North Koreans sucessfully invade and occupy the US of A—could be a wonderful setup for an excellent B-Movie style plot but personally I don't care much about any of the characters. At least the pilot guy I'm playing. The NPCs (the Goliath drone, too) just stand in the way, slow me down, won't let me open any door by myself and block the frame after kicking down the door, and so on and so on…What I like:• The graphics—not top notch anymore and probably never were, but the game looks cohesive in a good way;• Beeing able to stand, crouch and prone is good—switching between crouching and standing is good for getting in and out of cover fast, and to prone helped me in some tough scenes;• The setup of the story.What I do not like:• Guys, girls and drones standing in the way, blocking my view and blocking my way;• Doors magically closing behind me;• The weapons' sounds;• Somehow I feel small in this game. The POV is like everyone is at least one head taller than ""me"".• The story.I've read the multiplayer-part of this game is decent, but beeing almost a pure single player I can't judge. For SPs like me I can not recommend this game.			",560,224,12,87,53,7,101

												This is a difficult game to recommend, which is ultimately why I chose not to. Everything about this game had the makings to compete with the COD series, but it continually fell just short or was consistent throughout the game. A great example of that consistency is the story. When the story first starts and it hits the fan, the story is powerful and driving you on. You feel compelled to take back your country. That get's lost not even half-way through and then you are left doing the standard shoot-em-up gig which leaves a very hollow feeling after having seen what should have been. The game really isn't bad, and is definitely worth a few bucks if on sale, but I cannot honestly recommend this game with so many other and better qualified games out there.			",247,68,6,63,88,1,66

												Homefront Review (Spoiler Free)(Story)In the near future, global crises force countries to make aggressive decisions about their survival.  North Korea ends up coming out on top and once it solidifies its presence in Europe and Asia, it turns to North America.  The NK's invade from the West and life becomes hell for the average U.S. citizen.  You play a member of the resistance movement and are quickly hurled into the fight to break the NK's hold on the U.S.(Gameplay)Homefront is an FPS with rechargeable health, much like COD4.  There is no cover system though you can peak and lean once you aim down sights.  You can carry several weapons plus equipment and pick up weapons on the ground.  Most of the time you will be doing on-foot shooting however there are a few land and air vehicular segments.  You will usually fight with a team of resistance members, though do not expect much in terms AI competency.  Enemies on the other hand show average to below average intelligence.  Other than a few set moments, it's one shooting gallery after another, just at various times of day.  My favorite moment in the game is when you are given the ability to direct an unmanned rover and use it to clear your way through a neighborhood.  Most will complete the game in under three (that's right, 3) hours making this game a hard sell, especially with stronger competitors out there.  Multiplayer tries to mimic Battlefield style gameplay with vehicles, gadgets, and large maps but there are not many people except fans playing anymore.    (Design)The game looks and sounds decent.  As others have said, the opening sequence sets the stage for an epic game.  There are many good looking set piece moments, but they are marred by short levels and average gameplay.  Dialogue feels okay though nothing is worth quoting.(Final Comments)I believe the multiplayer component of this game was the primary focus during its creation.  Unfortunately it could not compete with Battlefield and instead, players are left with an average single player.  With a short campaign experience devoid of replayability and a relatively empty multiplayer, I do not recommend Homefront.  Hopefully the sequel fares better.			",114,8,1,6,3,1,8

												tl;dr: A bunch of great ideas with poor execution: the game. This game isn't really worth the $20 asking price. Campaign is three hours long on a good day, and the mulitplayer is a bland, unpopulated experience. For the same price you can buy battlefield 3 or 4 on Origin, which outclass this game in just about every aspect. Don't waste your time here.What it does right: I was hyped as hell when this first showed up, and the amount of advertisement and weird♥♥♥♥♥♥they did at E3 that year really made me want to buy it. The setting is a great idea. I wish more shooters would stray away from the modern military shooter that we're so used to by now and do things like this. However, when the reviews started coming out I'd figure I'd try it once it dropped in price... four years later.The mechanics work, I guess. It's nothing special, other than maybe getting to use the Goliath to shoot rockets at enemies that are giving you a hard time. None of the guns feel bad to use, and they have a good amount of punch on enemies, but at the same time they do feel kinda flimsy. For a shooter that came out in 2011, it works. It's nothing special but it's not like the mechanics of the game are terrible.A few of the set pieces were pretty cool, but those were a mix between laughable and alright. None of it felt particularly epic, but again, it served its purpose.What it does wrong: Oh boy where to start. I guess we can start with the singleplayer. It's overly linear. I don't mean the good kind of linear like Metro 2033 or Killzone. I mean straight out of call of duty corridoor nose-leading. If you go in any direction other than which one the game wants you to go, you'll run face first into an invisible wall. It doesn't matter if you just passed through that open door ten seconds ago, you go one way and one way only. And you can tell the designating fighting zones from the talking corridors by the random stacks of chest-high cover littered around. It's painfully obvious that this game doesn't really want you to go out on your own or do anything other than move from cover to cover shooting bad guys. There is no variety to any of it.The graphics also haven't aged well. I don't think they were even that great at the time. I think Half Life 2 looks better and it came out seven years before. The color scheme is bland and uninteresting, and you can't interact with anything other than picking up guns. Even your teammates have to open doors for you like this was a ps2 ww2 shooter.The campaign is, in its entirety, maybe three hours long if you stop to look at the scenery once in a while. I beat it in two and a half. It isn't even a good three hours either. I was actually kinda thankful it wasn't longer, otherwise I might not have gotten through it. None of your npc companions are even remotely interesting and they don't bother to characterize any of them beyond very basic traits. You have no reason to be invested in any of it, as they just sling you into the action three minutes into it with barely any explanation. This doesn't change the further you get into it, either. Only after following these rebels for an hour and a half or so do they finally tell me in the form of an off-hand comment that they needed me to fly a helicopter for them. You think they would have taken the time to brief the pilot on that important detail, or at least asked if he could fly a helicopter and wasn't just a jet pilot or something. The most motivation you get is the objective marker. No overall reason behind it, or important motive, just follow the arrow. Sure, I want to liberate the home of the free just as much as anyone, but blindly following the first couple of idiots that almost kill me in a car crash doesn't seem like it's the most solid of motivations.And another thing, I'm getting really tired of silent protagonists. It worked in games like Dead Space because Isaac was completely alone, and didn't need to talk to anyone most of the time, but here? There are usually three other people that need to be interacted with in combat situations. Games like Far Cry 3 and Spec Ops: The Line have completely destroyed the notion that video game protagonists are better silent. I have no interest in Jacobs like I did Jason. Being invested in your character as a person goes a long way into being better invested in the game overall. This game did nothing towards this and ended up being bland and forgettable.One last little rant before I get to the multiplayer: North Korea? Really? The only reason anyone ever gives them any respect is because they're allies with China. Never would a tiny, economically weak nation like North Korea ever be able to hold as much land as we are led to believe, or be able to invade and occupy the nation with the world's strongest military, even while under economic collapse.  The logistics of such things are simply impossible for North Korea, even if they did have the military size they say they do, which is most likely a lie. As much as I give battlefield 4's singleplayer♥♥♥♥♥♥ it at least had a believable scenario. Plus North Korean soldiers using Colt, Bushmaster, and Kriss USA firearms (All American-based firearm companies if you didn't know)? Did they even bother to do any research into this matter? Now for the Multiplayer: They tried to add some unique features like battlepoints to build up like killstreaks, using this money to spawn into vehicles and use special weapons. I like this better than cod's killstreak system, since it allows you to buy things even if you're not doing that well, but I still don't like it that much. First, just about every class gets a rocket launcher, and you can buy it after one kill. This is not good game design. Vehicles are pretty much useless beyond a quick kill or two if you find a group of enemies that knows what they're doing. Vehicles are pretty much instant kills on infantry too, so that's annoying, and you can't even use environmental ques to tell where they are like you might in battlefield, where you might hear it coming or see it firing on the minimap. I think it did show up on the minimap, but I never saw it before one killed me.It's got the standard setup for multiplayer unlocking systems. Get kills and unlock guns. I didn't play enough to unlock anything, but I never felt like using anything other than the first class was really necessary. I didn't see much variety in the enemies either, but then again the killcam gives you absolutely no information other than where the person who killed you was at. Since just about every class gets a rocket launcher, and sniping is pretty pointless on smaller maps imo, there didn't seem to be much variety to be had. I played a few games and there wasn't much exciting going on. The maps are too big for there to be large chunks of action, and I doubt that's ever going to change with the player counts as they are. Other games do everything so much better. Overall, this game is nothing but all of the stereotypical elements of first person shooters from 2011. It seems like a lazy attempt to pull away customers from cod's fanbase, and even then, it doesn't do anything better than call of duty, it just imitates it in a different setting. If this game had come out on the ps2 seven years before, then I think it might have been a lot better received. As it is now, that's kinda what it feels like: a generic ww2 shooter from the ps2 made for a later generation. There's nothing special about it other than its setting. The multiplayer is bland, the singleplayer is forgettable, and the entire thing is nothing but a cynical attempt at checkboxing fps elements to try to bring in the cod crowd.If you read this far and are still thinking about buying the game, please don't. I can not in good conscience recommend this game to anyone when battlefield 4, an infinitely better experience, is the exact same price. Buy that game for a much better fps experience.

												The game has a great story line that is for one sure thing. Wasn't happy I couldn't use a controller with it and the accuracy of any of the weapons was total crap. But it was fun to go through the game and look for bonuses and the ideals of future technology was awesome. You have to be quick in your responses or else you'll keep playing the same thing over and over until you beat the level. I was just overall shocked in a moment shooting a guy point blank with a shotgun and he didn't die. The mechanics of the game were not really working for me.			",28,4,0,2,7,0,1

												A mechanical facsimilie of Call of Duty set against a surprisingly novel backdrop, but released at a time when appetite for cookie-cutter corridor shooters was already declining. While it's a technically sound shooter with decent artwork and design, and a few memorable scripted moments sprinkled in, it's painfully formulaic; if you're a fan of Call of Duty, it'll seem like a less interesting knock-off. If you're tired of Call of Duty, this won't do anything to relieve your fatigue. If you hate Call of Duty, this won't do anything to win you over. The developers clearly believed in their project, but one can't help but wonder if their efforts might have been better spent elsewhere.Overall: 3.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really struggled with giving this game a like, but not for that reason. The short version is I got the interactive directors cut of Wolverines for $5. That is worth a like. I would call this game a good B movie.Long version (spoilers):This is not a great game. I kind of picked it apart on my play through, and these are in no particular order. The graphics are sub par, and I don’t mean that in the ""it's not ray-traced at 4K so it's crap"" kind of way. The visuals are muddy. Thank god the KPA doesn’t know what camouflage is, because the way everything blends is too much as is. More than this the LOD (level of detail) is very inconsistent. It really looks like every model uses the same texture resolution. While things like loose bricks look great, trucks look pixilated. Also, the game seems to have abandoned ANY post processing adding to the muddy problem. Those things aside though the game does a good job of selling the apocalyptic landscape. Trash and clutter are everywhere, and the graffiti is remarkably well done. The levels are dense, and complex, and chaotic. That is perfect for a semi-casual shooter like this. Best part, real business names. I got to shoot a KPA in a Hooters. It’s more fun than it sounds. I also got in a fire fight in a blazing Tiger Direct store, symbolic really. Every time I tossed a grenade I yelled “NewEgg!”The animations are acceptable. The facial animations look like Saturday morning cartoons since everyone has about two expressions and lip syncing didn't happen. All doors kick down the same with the same dust animation. Finally the weapon animations look like they were sped up after being animated at a realistic speed. That being said the animation are not buggy, and are actually really smooth and consistent. Taking into account how mal-proportioned the characters are the animations look pretty good.The story… OK, let’s play pretend. Let’s pretend that N. Korea had a GDP above $10. Let’s pretend that the DPRK’s NADA (National Aerospace Development Administration) has ever launched anything but a propaganda campaign. Let’s pretend that China would tolerate the Kims making a power play before them. Let’s pretend Russia wouldn’t turn N. Korea into glass for fun. This game does get one thing right. In an invasion of the US, the military would be the least of your problems. Despite the huge suspension of disbelief, I actually wanted to finish the story, and was disappointed when it ended at chapter 7. That alone earned the like rating.Just going to get this out there, this game wants to be Call of Duty: Modern Warefare (series) sooooooo bad. Problem is, they didn’t do anything worse, and actually did some things better, despite the lack in overall polish. *spoiler*“Why We Fight” opens with a solid 3 minute presentation on why we need the Geneva Convention, and it is so much better at it than “No Russian” and (and Davis Family Vacation for that matter). I will readily stack “Heartland” Against “Back on the Grid” and “Golden Gate” feels like “Iron Lady” without being tedious. “Firesale”… meh Spec Ops; The Line did it better in “The Gate” Unfortunately Connor is always there spouting 80s action movie one liners (I swear he was plucked from Command and Conquer: Renegade or a Schwarzenegger film). Price was so much cooler. Hell, Sandman is better than Connor. That aside, Rianna is a nice squad mate. Now I choose to ignore that she is dressed like that in a war zone. It’s not overt, but ARs and midriff only mix at a trade show. She does make up for that by giving the Bechtel test two to the head in every chapter. Nice to see we are getting closer to equality. I think of her as an early draft Miranda Lawson.Game play is alright. The controls are sloppy, but I knew that going in. That is just how THQ does things. Weapon damage tables are really good for a COD clone. The shotgun is actually useable. All the weapons feel different, but there are some glaring issues. The M16 has a 20RD magazine, and does not use M4, or Diablo SMG magazines. The M200 rifle has no kick when fired standing (at least compared to what a .338 should do to your shoulder) and somebody got “clipped” by a 20MM cannon. The Goliath thing is… Juggernaut. For a game that mentions taking cover in every level, there is no cover system. Over all, it’s alright. Buy this, buy Wolverines, either way it's worth a couple bucks.			",24,6,0,2,3,0,1

Experience being unable to take cover because your AI squad takes it first.Be confused by the lack of ammo, weapons that all look the same until you randomly pick one and realize it's♥♥♥♥♥♥See the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, with low quality textures that for the most part are completly lacking normal maps or any other detail aside from those few lucky ones that were given ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bumps using the Nvidia filter.And last but not least, have your agonizingly slow pace constantly interrupted by random invisible walls and weird collision detection that will put your adventure to a halt every 5 goddam seconds.Homefront is where the fiasco is.

This game has another enemy which is Korea, who jumped on America. We must fight as one of homefront soliders against the aggressor.Missions are mixed, one time we just shooting, and the other time we have to remotly control some vehicle which helps us to defeat our enemies. For special mention deserves the last mission, which is full of action, and gives us great ending of story.Ups:- Story- New look on War- ruthless aggressor- sneaking missions- AIDowns:- Bugs- invisible walls- a little clunky gameplayNeutral:- Graphic - it isn't great, but it isn't bad.

												A pleasant little FPS game. There is nothing particularly exceptional about the game: the mechanics are fairly standard, the narrative is good, though not perhaps as good a treatment of the idea (SE Asian upstart invades US West Coast) as others have done. The mechanics for the PC are unpolished: hints at the bottom of the screen gave button numbers, which doesn't help if you play with mouse+keyboard as I did. And in two cases (Goliath and grenade launcher), the only way to access these necessary functions was by reaching down and pushing the joystick on the otherwise unused controller. In another case, it gave no useful indication of how to control the helicopter's altitude, leaving me to button mash for a good ten minutes (failing the mission at one point) (it turned out to be, absurdly, the 5th button on the mouse). Nevertheless, I played the game for the narrative, and it has a couple of stand-out points. The first for sure is the opening mission, where you play as one being arrested (why? who knows. For harboring rebellious attitudes, it seems) and on the bus ride to your eventual fate, you see the world around you being corrupted and destroyed, invaders ""cleansing"" (?) the local population. I'm not entirely sure why the occupying force would willy-nilly kill mothers and fathers, citizens and non-aggressive individuals, but they are certainly familiar to us as the most iconic images of war and dictatorships, whether Nazi or Chinese, Serbian or Chilean, and they have a strong effect on the reader. The second is the burning of the city (Colorado, somewhere), that is revealed at a moment when the characters leave on a mission. The game certainly brings home the consequences of war - I'm not sure how much of it is entirely credible (I very much doubt the Koreans could take down the entire midwest with paratroopers), but it gives plenty of haunting images of what life would be like in a very different, and as far as a political collapse of the US, somewhat plausible America. The collage of news reports and video documentaries that provide the prologue to the game is well done. Otherwise, the arc of the characters is fairly predictable (""I bet _he's_ gonna die"") and I never actually attached to my own character, but rather than a fault, this is really only a missed opportunity. The game itself is rather short, as well. I only played about 5 hours, and it ended rather abruptly. It hinted at the turning point of the war, but I would have preferred the thrill to get to see that happen, and the Koreans begin to retreat. I was expecting it, and to not have it I felt was another missed opportunity.For the $5 I paid, certainly worth it. Total: 7/10 (mostly for the haunting images and sequences).

												This game one of most underrated game I play.Single player campaign is fresh with American empire taken over by missile mad Koreans.  People say campaign too short or not as good as Modern Warfare game.  I don't see problem.  The game has good direction as you move through occupied America watching Korean kick♥♥♥♥♥before big battle on red bridge.As well as killing many Korean I also like that you can do some parts where you also kill Americans.  Without this I would not like game as much.  Campaign not hard but good to see story and horror of war, such as Americans thrown into ditch.  Maybe a new Homefront could be made where Jalalabad control America.  This would be true epic and big seller in my country.  More so that pirated copies of Windows XP.Multiplayer is really really good.  You run, kill, die, respawn... over and over repeat process.  More kills and objective points give you bonuses like unlock vehicles and air strike.  Within few minutes of game you see people bring chopper and tank.  No spawn killing as spawn keep moving away from enemy.Another thing about online that make me hard is knifing.  You can spam knife running through building to make new Kill Bill 3 movie.  Watching bodies pile up then dropping payload on reinforcements is better than stale bread.  Once I do cartwheel after getting 10 kill streak with knife only.  I kick my light.

												This is a pretty fun FPS. Its the year 2027 and the North Korean taken all of Asia and then trying to over America. (Like that going to happen.) The campaign is very short. Like 4-5 hours short but fun. The helicopter scene was pretty fun and i like the hand painted drawings between the chapters. The controller and keyboard works great, cinematography moments where great and multi-player wasn't to bad. Kinda like BF3 in way. In all the game is fun with friends and a good causal FPS.

												I'm glad I got this game in a humble bundle or something similar. The campaign took me exactly 3 hours to finish on normal difficulty!! I think that says enough. The premise of the story is fun enough but this was exceptionally short for a shooter, what a let down. I thought once you start joining the big league you have another dozen missions but nope.. credits roll. Besides that, it's a bit bland on the shooting, the scripted NPCs don't do a good job of keeping the game fluid.			",121,28,7,13,13,0,15

												Supposedly a good multiplayer experience. But if you, like me, just like to experience a good single player campaign, don't bother. Even if you are a John Milius fan (this is not the expected ""Call of Duty meets Red Dawn""). On the pro side (which is more of a ""not completely distgusting"" side) you get some distinctive characters (well, you'll be able to distinguish between the philosophical positions of Rianna and Connor. And you'll recognize Hopper because he's the Korean kid. Let's not overdo it with character depth), you get a ""Go Wolverines"" banner, the story is kinda sorta engaging, the 4 hours needed to complete it are kinda sorta acceptable and the cliffhanger ending qualifies as ""it was probably pretty cool when Milius described it to the designers"". What really kills it is the implementation in the game: The flow is generally interrupted by barriers of the invisible (ah, okay, I am not supposed to go explore a bit, yes?) and visible kind (it is annoying to see the NPCs hurdle them and not being able to oneself), the events are badly timed (ah, to get rid of the enemy Goliath, I need to press this button exactly now?) and the mix of required interaction and watching pre-scripted scenes is badly balanced. All of that ruins the immersion feeling.So: No reason to play this for single player fans. Go watch any version of Red Dawn instead, at least these movies won't bother you with bad interaction design. And while you are at it, check out Tomorrow When The War Began. P.S.: Does anyone know what Primary Weapons System paid to get their Diablo into that game? I like long-stroke piston guns like the next guy, but seeing this rather obscure thing as a standard weapon in the game was kinda distracting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me list the ways you can die in this game. Grenade that's 10M away from you Insanely accurate machine gunner from 100M+ RPG Units that know exactly when you're coming up from prone Following your squad leader Tanks/APCs with Terminator level guidence systems Random explosionsNow to the serious stuff, this game is really not good. You are some indiscriminate character drafted into the resistance, after some event happens. I honestly don't remember what it was, as it was that forgetable. And seriously, the North Koreans as an enemy? Could they not find a smaller army?Homefront suffers from horrible AI, both enemy and friendly. Enemies will stand out in the open, laying down massive and accurate rounds of fire on you. Fire one shot, and they all train their sights on you instantly. Friendlies will get in the way at every single chance. Also, you are forced to be the last person through any entry point. Meaning; have to climb up a ladder? Have fun watching your three squad mates climb up it frirst before you get a prompt to climb. Wanna crawl under that fence? Nope, have to wait till everyone goes before you.None of the characters are memorable, including the one you play. In fact, there were plenty of times where commands were issued and I had to question if I was the one being commanded to do them. The story is disjointed at best. A game about the occupation of the US? Cool, I'm in, but this was poorly done and felt rushed. Great potential with the idea, making US citizens insurgents, but more time could have been spent fleshing it out. After 4.5 hours I had the game beat, and that was after I died, a lot.Speaking of which, the ending, talk about the most lack luster ending ever. Granted I didn't stay past the first couple of credits (I exited quickly to write this review) but there was no gratification, no bad guy to defeat, no nemisis to duel. Just a quick battle for a landmark and roll credits. This could have easily been a trilogy if the time was taken to create a proper story.At 75% off it's still not worth it. Although I should note that I have not played the multiplayer (And won't) so I can't comment on its value there.This is a great idea for a game, but horribly executed, painfully short and terribly forgetable.

Then you see them put people in mass graves, then you burn them alive, then you see them touture your leader. I mean, jesus. But then you kill them all with 'Murican music and make them pay.

												A first-person shooter by every definition of the term, but not a particularly interesting one. The plot is at least an interesting take on the same old America-vs.-commies plot we've all grown used to and the voice acting is actually quite good, but the gameplay doesn't really do enough to supplement it. Your character feels like he moves too slow, the enemies are far too numerous, the levels aren't very variable and even the guns feel weirdly... soggy. They don't have the ""oomph"" that the weapons of games like Call of Duty do. It reallyt is a shame, sine this game really could have done something good with the story it has - but the gameplay honestly wastes it all.Pros:+ Interesting plot+ Pretty good voice actingCons:- Movement feels sluggish- Guns aren't fun to use- Unremarkable level design.

												A bit dull and generic, the movement and gunplay seems to be intentionally almost identical to recent Call Of Duty games. Completely forgettable storyline. No unique or interesting features. Bought it when it was on sale, but still regret it. Found occasional bugs, nothing game-breaking, mostly weird texture issues, or parts where I'd have to restart a checkpoint for something not my fault.Edit: Why has this got downvoted a ton, the reference to Call Of Duty? I don't like those games either, but the similarities are clear enough to warrant comparison. Meanwhile the top 'helpful' reviews are memes and three-word reviews. Cool!			",188,25,16,8,14,1,3

												6/10.This is a tough one. Homefront generally is a subpar CoD. That's one reason why it's a negative review. The other is that the game offers moderately ok gunplay, shallow characters, stuck on terrain bugs, basically no innovative features and an incoherent plot that only takes you about 3 to 4 hours to complete. Just when you think things start rolling in the US again, the game is suddenly over. Just like that. No conclusion. We don't even know up until the very end what we even did and why we did what we did and how THAT helped win the battle. Which is disappointing.That isn't to say that Homefront can't be a nice little experience. Especially the setting and the disgusting nature of the occupation are pretty well presented. The graphics aren't ugly, but nothing to look up to either. Crysis 1 looks better for example, but is a lot older as far as I can recall.Homefront is simply a game of missed opportunities and at still 20 bucks I can't recomment buying it. Got it during a sale for 5 bucks, which is ""ok-ish"". If you like CoD gameplay, grab it, if not, just leave it. Unfortunately the whole Homefront project got pretty much abandoned and ""remade"" into something, which is apparently just as mediocre. It's sad, because if you extend the story by about 100 to 200% (so maybe 6 to 8 hours at least), spread in some more interesting missions, for example infiltration or something in the wilds, I dunno. Not just shooty shooty though and garnish everything with some interesting characters (Hell, the Duke has more character than these guys) and a well-thought out plot with maybe a bit better gameplay as well. And you have yourselves a winner. As it stands right now, this serves as a 10 dollar prequel game to an actual game.			",209,55,12,41,26,3,66

												I read all the bad reviews, and decided to wait until the game was $5 to buy it...and I still couldn't sit through more than a couple hours of gameplay. Stilted, jerky movement, incomprehensible control placement (z for prone? really?) and an infuriating inability to control your character in areas you should absolutely have control - why do I have to walk with this insanely slow, plodding gate through these ""info"" scenes? Oh my god, let me run around! And what's with the terrible aspect ratio and lack of 1920x at full screen? What is this, 1995?			",19,2,0,1,0,0,0

												The campaign was over before it really started. It was only a few hours long and it felt like the beginning of a much longer game that might have had potential. As it is, it's a  very short standard linear modern shooter. It got frustrating having to wait for an NPC to open a door or remove an obstacle so the story can progress. The graphics looked nice at times and also some of the weapons were a lot of fun to shoot. There's a helicopter part thrown in that was entertaining. I played one game of multiplayer on the only server (it was laggy) that's still up. I'd say give Homefront a try if you're bored and the game is on sale for cheap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know how you remember certain moments in a game, when you got all excited you did this and that happened, well none spring to mind with homefront.A brief and dull affair badly trumped in my opinion by bulletstorm.If being comparative is left to one side we have an FPS playing out a rather generic possible reality where natural resources are so scarce that its every man for himself. Usher in the words resistence and government and you have the well done dish of the day that is one world governance as country after country slaves for out right dominance, sadly with you not invited. Your tubed from one section to the next with little concern for connecting or indentifying with friendly AI others. The weapons are bland and more a rat, at, tat than a thud, thud of bullets ripping there way through the enemy AI's torso. Graphics and sound are unrevolutionary and single play very very short.You see no matter how you slice it and dice it, this game comes up familiar and wanting so unless its cheaper than the asking price when your making a decision, there are others better suited to waste time on.

												Wow. Where do I start with this one?After reading some of the other positive reviews it seems that most people enjoy this game for its multiplayer. I am not really that into multiplayer games and even if I wanted to play multiplayer on this game I doubt there would be very many open servers (I could be wrong).That aside my review is based solely on the single player campaign and it is for those of you who are considering getting this game for the campaign.It's not worth it. It's not worth 19.99. Luckily I was able to get my copy from Amazon which was much cheaper but if you were to purchase this on steam I would wait for a sale.The combat is okay, nothing special, typical FPS really. The enemies and allies alike make the same sounds when being shot, the guy Connor barks at you constantly as if his testicles have been punched into his stomach, and the game gets a little buggy when the NPC's are waiting/expecting you to follow them - when in fact I would be in front of them. Also barking orders after I've already done what they told me to do, just simple sort of bugs like that.The story.. er.. plot, there isn't really much of one. Which is disappointing because I applaud this FPS unique choice to have a guerilla warfare shooter take place in the USA, but they really dropped the ball with this one. I couldn't care less about any of the characters, in fact I wanted Connor to die. He annoyed the crap out of me.The story/plot felt so mediocre that they even managed to fulfill the stereotypical Asian engineer/computer technical guy and the black guy that dies halfway through the game. Shocker. Nah, I'm kind of kidding about that part, I mean yeah, I noticed it was kind of a stereotypical thing but that's not really a big deal to me. It's just it was the cherry on top of an already lackluster sundae.In a few months I'll probably not even remember a single thing about this game because none of it was memorable. I should have listened to the reviews that said not to get the game if you were just interested in the campaign. Well, reviewers that said that - You were right.Also the game is kind of short. I know that 8-12 hours is a standard length for a FPS, but I played the game on hard and beat it within 5ish hours. (The almost 10 hours thats recorded on Steam was because I left for several hours with the game paused a couple of times).If I played the game on easy or normal, I'd imagine one could finish this within 4 or less easily.Anyway guys, I don't recommend getting this game. It's not worth the price they are asking for it. It would be worth a consider if they were asking maybe 4.99-7.99, but definitely not 19.99			",72,38,0,8,10,0,5

												OhMyGod.This is possibly the worst generic first person shooter there is, you thought that all the CODs are bad? You've seen nothing yet,  this is...linear corridor heavily scripted fest...which lasts 5 hours! I hated every minute I spended in this game. And it was just 5 hours, jesus, jesusity christ.You would except big polish from games like this, say what you want about CODs, yes they kind of suck,but when it comes to polish and detail they tend to be rather good. This game..you can't even see the hands of the main hero when he's clmbing. The only good thing that came out of this game was the soundtrack, which is really good and I remember it to this day...multiplayer was decent, nobody plays it anymore of course, so there's no point mentioning it, as you are not going to be playing it.The story....eeeuuugh Korea (lol) takes over the entire world (lolololol) and some other crap I don't care about, all characters are generic, you've got your gurl soldier, your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥soldier and your silent Gordon Freeman protagonist. Oh, and there is some guy who dies, he is charming. The game really wants to shock you, first thing you see is soldiers killing son's parents in front of his eyes. It gets old.I also remember this game having some poor optimization with mediocre graphics to go along with it. The game had super big hype, and it didn't deliver on it. At all.Gameplay...Call of Duty...regenerating health...two weapons limit....gunplay's the same...what more can I possibly say? And there is boss at the end! QTE boss! Have fun!There is apparently next game in the works by Crytek. So I guess next Homefront is going to be graphics ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with the same gameplay of this game? I'll pass.Sooo...in the end..any pluses? Well...the game's super short...and the soundtrack, I really like the soundtrack.3/10			",193,13,1,10,7,0,5

												Sweet merciful CRAP was that a short game or what? Steam says that I played 3 hours of it, and that's not even an I-beat-it-quicker-than-you brag; I was trying to explore.Anyway, I thought it was awesome. The campaign is insanely epic, even if there are some annoying parts, and the shooting mechanics are absolutely top-notch. The guns react amazingly, and if you have a decent sound system, you can really feel each shot. The graphics aren't the greatest if you get right up close, but for the most part they're pretty good. Character models and animations are very well done, so that's at least something. If I'd paid $60 for it, I would be livid, but as I paid more like $7 for it, I think it was worth it. Check it out if you like shooters, and can find it on sale. I have no comment on multiplayer, as I don't care for competitive shooters in the slightest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My rating: 3.5 / 10The majority of the entertainment that can be derived from Homefront is mostly just from how remarkably terrible it is, as it achieves nothing more than being an underwhelming and bug ridden CoD clone.Pros: - A number of creative scenarios for the player that adds some variety to the gameplay.- Soundtrack isn't too bad.- Representation of an Asian American video game character.Cons:- Very glitchy, from overall player control, to physics errors, to scripted events failing to play out correctly.- Enemy AI is very rough around the edges. Sometimes being completely dumb, and other times having the precision of a super computer.- Bland story, with a rather anti-climactic ending.- Dialogue hardly makes sense in some cases, making the characters appear incredibly unintelligent.- Very short singleplayer campaign, though in the case of this game, it's probably a plus.Homefront probably could have been a decent game, had it been given the proper attention and resources during development, as there were some points that showed a bit of potential. However, unfortunately this was nowhere near enough to redeem how glitchy and poorly put together the final product ended up being.			",127,17,1,14,2,0,3

I can't imagine anyone actually thinks this is fun.  setting up a scenario with some scripted actions to help tell a story and set a mood is one thing, but this is just ridiculously absurd.  may as well be a game that is a black screen that has a red dot that appears occasionally, your goal is to click the mouse button when it appears.  this game is not much better than that.   dragging you around by the nose taken to an insane extreme.

												decided to install this game again after a long time, couldn't really remember what it was.   now I know why i didn't play it much.   oh my god this game is horrendous.  go here, do that, quick quick quick, wait sit still, go go go, no you did it wrong game over.   I can't imagine anyone actually thinks this is fun.  setting up a scenario with some scripted actions to help tell a story and set a mood is one thing, but this is just ridiculously absurd.  may as well be a game that is a black screen that has a red dot that appears occasionally, your goal is to click the mouse button when it appears.  this game is not much better than that.   dragging you around by the nose taken to an insane extreme.

												Other reviewers said it would be good graphically and it surely doesn't disappoint.  The quality of the single player campaign is awesome in that it has definite replay value as when you die it makes you want to play that section of the game again and do it with eventually next to no deaths or no deaths next time.  A very intense story with very intense action ...  a quality game.  I paid $6.49 CAN I believe for this all and it is worth much more than that.  As for the MPer I haven't touched that yet but see it as an extra to a game that doesn't need it as the single player campaign stands out on it's own well.  In regards to the single player the objectives set in front of you on the spur of a moment well they are fun and breath taking at times.  The sounds/music in this game are epic and definitely get you pumped to be playing the game.  There are moments where certain things happen to certain characters and you feel emotion for them for what they are going through.  I would have kept playing tonight but I have to feed another gaming addiction too.  Back log for life but I say if you are looking for a pick up and play shooter that is intense and fun play this one.			",430,39,23,44,20,6,21

												Im glad i got this game on sale...  Its stupidly short.  3.4 hours going from start to finish.  Its clear that this games focus is on Multiplayer.  That being said, the singleplayer plays well.  Would have loved to have more fun with Golith but meh.  Also, for a game that is almost dependent on cover to survive, why is there no lean option?  There were times when i was being shot around corners by someone i could not see because they had just a slight lean to the right able to look around a corner.  Im also half tempted to call this game ""On Rails""  Since it guides you where you need to be at all times and never shuts up untill you get there.  In short i cant recommend this game due to how stupidly short it is and a few issues with the gameplay....and that story... while good on paper, it was told♥♥♥♥♥♥poorly here.			",286,57,2,43,27,3,43

												Easily one of the worst games I have ever played.In the singleplayer campaign there is an incredibly cheap blatant attempt to give some sort of meaning, pull at emotion or whatever it was they intended by having dozens of civilians executed and mowed down by gunfire and wanton violence more vicious than Hitler's SS would dream, and not all too longer after those instances you're introduced to a mass grave.Where in Mass Effect 3 they managed to summarize the global genocide of humanity on Earth by focusing on the death of a single kid being killed in a shuttle shot down as Shepard leaves, this game utterly failed after tossing hundreds of dead civilians at your face. It is a ♥♥♥♥ing disgrace.When it comes to multiplayer, I have no idea. After joining a server I spawned and proceeded to get sniped within a few seconds several times until I just quit the game and uninstalled. I never saw a single person and never will unless someone pays me to play that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I rather have spent the $5 put towards this game on a big bag of Skittles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, this game was really good, but that ending though..bloody hell, you think it's the end of a chapter but it turns out to be the end of the main campaign. This was the first game I bought on steam after deciding to no longer pirate games, but it did almost nothing to convince to stay here. I will probably play it again before number 2 comes out, which I hope and pray doesn't follow in the foot steps of the first. Also, multiplayer is harder than blood dark souls, holy hell, how does a person survive???Graphics - very goodMechanics/playability - very goodbugs - none encounteredmultipplayer - no comment6/10 - would recommend if you enjoy insane multiplayer battles, not for the main campaign			",99,13,1,13,4,0,4

												You play the game, enjoy interesting premise and feel like something is missing. Like there should be something more, but the shooting is great, linear action is fine, but when the game finishes in the middle, I felt like there should be at least some chapter. Something that will make me feel like I reached some goal, but no, I seized some big bridge and end. Multiplayer was good reason to play this, but no one plays it anymore, so you have only 5 hour unfinished campaign.			",203,56,9,27,27,2,24

												Come on, what is this ? People who thought the latest Call Of Duties were short, prepare for a new contender. That's right, even with a small pause inbetween, I finished it in 4 hours. It's ridiculous for a full priced game. For the first time I really feel like I've wasted my money. Now, don't get me wrong; it's a good game, but you jump from one scenario to another one way too soon. There should've been more (or longer anyway) missions. And I don't think the multiplayer added something new to the genre. It's dull and from the start there were too many campers sitting around. Say what you want, but Call Of Duty is still king of (over the top) FPS storytelling and, in my opinion, the multiplayer experience just can't be beat. Get this game when it's $10-15.[Rating: 77/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												The game desperately wants to invoke some emotions, but it feels clumsy and sometimes cheesy. And if you realize this and you see for example a quite village with playing children, you know it will be destroyed in an instant and the game expects you to weep for the lost souls, for the lost homes. I am not saying there shouldn't be such games. They should. All I am saying is that when developers learn to deal with subtlety and drop the ""in-your-face"" approach, it may even work.

												I recently bought this game as i started it on console and never got round to finishing it.With 4.2 hours in game and not all of them actually playing it, i have already finished the campaign. Suffice to say i was certainly surprised at this short story.  But i still enjoyed it . The story is one unlike any other games i have come across and the concept of it had me hooked.Saying that, the characters and gameplay were a bit bland and the actual gameplay fairly linear and nothing special. Haven't tried out the multiplayer so i am not too sure if thats the main focus for this game.Do i recommend this? No, but then i wouldn't recommend it either. Final Note - It isn't worth the £15, i got it on sale. ",100,11,0,3,5,0,2

												Terrible, Terrible, Terrible.The trailer was the best part of the game.  I had such high hopes for the storyline and that it was written by the Red Dawn author.Things that sucked in my opinion:*No HP/HUD - Regenerative Health*Endlessly respawning North Koreans*AI was terrible - could hit a guy and not take him out, but then he would lose interest in me if I ducked around a corner*Hit boxes - I could shoot a guy in the shoulder and be given a head shot - hurray for sniping with a shot gun*Rockets that can hit me from around the corner - how did the enemy know where I was to curve his rocket around?*Being yelled at by my allies where to go and whom to shoot - ConstantlyThe gameplay was tedious. I didn't even bother finishing the game. My one regret was spending money and time purchasing and playing this game.  I would rather have punched myself in the nuts for 3 hours while being yelled at in Korean than play this game.Do-not-purchase-this-game!  If you gift this game to someone, you deserve all the bad that can possibly befall you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												- Generic COD clone that brings nothing new to the table.- Frustrating ""endless enemy spawn"" mechanic used to artificially ramp up the difficulty. It's only on a few levels, but it's noticeable, and it's annoying.- Friendly AI is annoying, constantly vocalizing the same crap order repeatedly. Furthermore, there were times where I would try to reach cover or navigate around an object to gain a tactical advantage in battle, only to be blocked by the AI. Best example? Trying to get through a door so that I didn't get blown up by a grenade, and then getting locked out by my ""ally's"" buttocks.- Music isn't memorable.- The plot is severely lacking. You're a pilot, but you wind up sniping and gunning the entire game (there's one part where you fly a helicopter, but it's the shortest and easiest level in the game). It's also kind of unsatisfying. The entire first half of the game is dedicated to putting tracker bugs on something. Then you get to the end, fight in a battle that's easier than most of the battles up to that point, don't really do anything too fancy, and then are treated to a fifteen second audio clip about the event that you just played through. Also it's basically just Red Dawn except with grown-ups.- Gunplay is a mess. If you're not ADS, you're not hitting anything. This is fine for most of the game, but there are a couple of times where you just really need to spray and pray because you're that close, and yet you can't, because the bullets are going to miss.+ Graphics are pretty good.+ You get to kill people.+ They did put a lot of time and effort into making the story. There's 61 ""pieces of lore"" to find that help reveal how the world got to be so cwazy. I still think they could have chosen a better country than North Korea to be the aggressor, though (maybe China by the time the game takes place, but North Korea? ... yeah, right).+ It's short.

												Don't bother. The game looks bad, it plays bad, and it's not even a great port. It looks like Blops 1 graphics, the guns all feel the same and pretty much ARE the same. The story is pretty terrible and cliche, North Korea taking over America + the rest of the world? Really? They could have chosen practically any other nation and it would have been more likely. The enemies have awful AI and the game plays with a mixture of the worst of Battlefield and CoD. It has wave after wave of idiot enemies like CoD, and it has the open maps of Battlefield which would be fine if not for the clown cars of koreans that arrive. Go buy CoD, the story is generally the same junk, but at least most of the guns feel different from eachother and the AI isn't nearly as dumb. Multiplayer is pretty much dead and suffers from the gunplay issue. Unless you have a fascination with Korea or are incredibly desperate for a FPS then pass this.			",508,104,12,60,23,7,29

												This game is short and♥♥♥♥♥♥but I bet any amount of money that stupid people will line up to throw money at the second game in an instant. Edit: Since people are getting angry that my review is so short, let me elaborate why I don't recommend this game. The mechanics are okay at best, they're essentially the same as Call of Duty but there's a few gimmicks that hardly last more than one mission before the devs said ""Oh, well that's enough actual fun for this game."" Secondly, the story is pretty decent, it's an interesting concept but it's way too short. 3 hours of gameplay is hardly worth it but people still insist about the multiplayer aspect. I really didn't buy this game with the intention of playing it online because I wanted to experience the story, not listen to the 12 year old fanbase complain about everything. Lastly, The characters are flat, they're boring and they don't have any sort of depth to them. In fact, their interaction with each other is laughable. It's rigid and lifeless, and the npcs just look like they're bored with being in such a bad game. Basically the same people are working on the sequel so clearly they're going to be making a mediocre sequel. TL;DR there is no TL;DR, read the whole review			",847,323,24,105,84,5,107

												I'll spare you from reading a long review like most, but just tell you why I do not recommend this.- its very boring.- No replayability.- No characters worth remembering.- Overpriced(wouldnt pay more than 2$....  not even joking)- Cheap Call of Duty rip off.- Story is very redundant and predictable.

												I decided write review about this game. Overall qality is really good,You really deep inside the  reality of the game world. However the compain is quite short. I pass it for less than two hours. More over if people concern about multiplayer its dead only 3-4 people play online maps, and more over looks like battlefield. My advice this game is good for quickly spend time in the  evening. However the price on steam tooo high for old game....			",710,220,23,78,142,10,167

												Even more controlling and limted than Colonial MarinesDO NOT BUY- bad for even $3.99, I'm just playing to the end, reluctantly, like a DPRK political prisoner- clipping terrible- poor control- acting and story lame- time crisis like infinite enemies- korean camo would not be white- enemies can shoot right through cover- sentry guns ignore friends- no direction for new weapons or control- armed resistance guys walking right through korean camps- graphics, control, and environment are pre-1999- another stupid sexxxy chick character, THERE WOULD BE NO SEXXXY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT- the developer Kaos is now defunct because of this game, no wonder- worst linear and most controlled, more controlling than current North Korea- wanted to give up at chapter 2- story is plausible- silencer?  what for?  if you can not sneak and snipe and you are controlled then what's the point?- ammo is so hard to pick up and conserve, Wolfenstein 3D allows you to conserve and survive more- guns are limited, I can not even describe how stupid the gun and ammo system is- damage is realistic, it only takes a few rounds to kill- grenades against turrets says it all, the game at certain points, forces physics to ""improve"" the storyline			",9,2,0,7,0,0,3

Enemies can shoot through walls and impossible locations...... there is no such thing as suppression so if they are shooting and you are shooting back.... they are pretty much deadshot into your♥♥♥♥♥ Player is slow as a real american shopping at walmart. Story wise was pretty bad... didn't make any sense in terms of politics.... or even the storyline. There were parts which was supposed to emotional but it just felt really forced and stupid.

												Too many bugs. Enemies can shoot through the bodies of your team and the enemys can shoot through walls ;-)But i play it at difficulty hard. Maybe the bugs are only at the hard difficulty.The enemys are really clever but with all these bugs it´s a poor developed game.I understand why the publisher THQ and the devs Kaos Studios were closed years ago.But it has a good story and the bugs make this game very difficult to play.Endless (400 and more) masses of enemys in lots of areas because the players has to wait the perfect moment where he can escape to truck - that´s really stupid.Now i know that the game has checkpoint bugs - i lost checkpoints after i was hit.I can´t recommend this game. It has too many bugs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun, interesting, and short.  The premise of the game is nice, and executed well.  I especially like the newspapers that you collect that flesh out the backstory.  Speaking of which, it appears they put a lot of thought in how things came to be in this game.However, like I said before and which has been said on many a game site, the game is short.  Only about seven levels  and took me about 4-5 hours to complete first time through.  In addition your character can kind of move in a sluggish manner compared to some other popular FPSs, but it is a minor quip and is not problematic to adjust to.I would recommend this game, however I would wait to purchase it when Steam has it on sale for like 5 bucks, like I did.  The game is way to short to pay full current price of twenty bucks.			",323,68,1,49,14,1,18

												I would give this a thumbs down just on the sheer idea that the marketers lied about how involved the writer of Red Dawn was in the development of this Game (he barely touched it). Let's not even mention the bad story, awful characters, routine gunplay, generic weapons, shooting gallery-esque level design, poor pacing, dumb ai, glitches, short length, and wasted opportunities. Some sections are enjoyable, but this game was trying to play in the big leagues with call of duty and battlefield (least judging by it's $50 million development budget they were), and it fails miserably.

												Homefront is a straight-forward and very enjoyable FPS, based on the premise of Far Eastern forces attacking and invading the USA. There are some very good set pieces in the game, a large array of weapons to pickup and utilise (only two of which can be carried at anyone time) and laid heavily with some great, convincing voice acting.Although still some distance behind Half-Life 2, Homefront did occasionally dip into that 'righteous campaign' feel that HL2 managed so well. You did get the feeling of David & Goliath - being hopelessly outnumbered, but fighting on for a true cause, regardless.The game itself is only short - it took me a mere 4hrs to complete the SP campaign and I hardly raced through it. But its a clever, rewarding and worthy game of attention.A solid 8.5/10			",325,46,21,42,39,2,85

												This game is awesome.People say it's a Call of Duty clone, well it's a war game. A good, entertaining, shocking and fun one. And this is what counts.Technically/gameplay wise it might not be top notch and a CoD feels a tad smoother, but this one has been created with much more love into it.It does not have highest end graphics but it has incredible detail everywhere and overall the graphics are really great.I haven't played the MP much but it turned out to be cool.Besides, it is a much better PC game overall with a lot of settings. Experience may vary when playing it only on one monitor, on 3 like I play it, it's absolutely awesome.My only concern is the price. I could grab it for a good price (around 20€/30$) which I think perfect. I can only recommend it.If you HATE CoD to death then Homefront may not be for you because afterall it's the same kind of play, but that should be obvious.			",386,76,22,26,37,2,54

												This isn't accualy a reccomendation but more so a DO NOT BUY!  the campaign took me a total of 5 hours to beat.  There is nothing cool about this game at all.  The storyline was pretty good but they leave you with a cliffhanger that i saw comming.  The gameplay is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at best.  you don't crouch behind cover you have to lay down for it to be of use.  The AI is fairly dumb they can take a mag or two from your gun but you can only hold about 3 mags at a time and the guns are a plenty except that they carry 5 different types of guns that do not take the same ammo.To sum it up.  Im not impressed.  Call of duty has better gameplay than this a longer storyline.*Spoiler*Ending: You may have turned the tide of the war.  That is all,  no debreif or anything not even a  sum up of the events that happened			",273,25,2,46,37,0,56

Yep, this game was barely 4 hours then done.  That's too bad for it does get really good later.  It has MP, but never played it.  Check it out when in the $5 bin.			",818,169,5,146,15,0,71

												I realy wish this was a more reveiw function, but this game can ♥♥♥♥ RIGHT OFF. when yu die at least 50 times in a level, due to stupid reasons and checkpoints far between, you get REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I do not recomend this game, multiplayer suck balls. singleplayer is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and dialoge is♥♥♥♥♥♥ it all is so akward. the story is maginaly good, but thats all the game has on it's side, the guns are all recoiled to ♥♥♥♥, and enemies are accurate as ♥♥♥♥, its like Far Cry, but not good. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. i do not recomend it, I dont even want to finish it, im just going to look up gameplay on youtube to see how it ends and then be through.This game gets a 28/100 for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay, and below average story and story telling.

												Unfortunately where Homefront had tremendous potential it completely dropped the ball in virtually every other. I really liked the story, especially since I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area where some of the story takes place, but that's where my positive thoughts for Homefront stops. How companies get away with only providing 4 hours of content now is beyond my understanding. The controls are clunky and you have to repeatedly press buttons to crouch and prone instead of holding them like I am used to. The mechanics are extremely unrefined - you can blast enemies in the head repeatedly and they won't die. You can barely peak out from a corner and an enemy far away can pick you off. The game feels too rushed and unpolished, and if they had taken the time to iron out everything and make the campaign longer, Homefront could have been a really good game.But I do feel like the potential is there especially with it's great concept of a story - perhaps if Homefront 2 ever see's light, it will be refined and polished and provide us with more substance to allow us to really get into the game.

												There was a lot of hype associated with this game. The trailers alone were enough to convince a lot of people, including myself, to buy it. After completing it, I can't help but agree with the common criticism that the game is far too short. It'd be one thing if the ending brought some closure to the story, but it ends just as the action in the game gets really good, and in an obvious [failed] attempt to lure customers into eagerly anticipating the sequel. Given the alarmingly short campaign and the overestimated graphics, this game falls short of being worth its $49.99 price tag. The campaign is fun however, and the multiplayer, despite its relatively gutted graphics, has some potential for addictive and competitive gaming (especially for snipers), but it doesn't compete well with some other multiplayer FPS games available. While I don't feel completely disappointed, I can't in good conscience recommend it at its current price.			",164,23,2,24,13,2,32

												If you like COD but want something fresh i would recommend Home front for you to play. Home Front multi player is really awsome because its like COD with vehicles :D   and allso its a bit more fastpace than the call of duty games. Also the HomeFront campaign is a bit shortet then COD but the HomeFront campaign is just SOOOOOOOOOOOO AWSOME with huge explosions and beautiful graphics. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Could be worse, could be better.The campaign is pretty cool, and the feeling while shooting is nice and charging.The multi player alas, is pretty unbalanced, with a points-to-buy sort of killstreaks and powerups for your soldier with no team restriction. Prepare to have a sky full of bombers, machine gun drones and UAV guided missiles. Poor footsoldiers and sharpshooters can't live too long. Too bad for these balancing issues, could have been a far better game.			",125,5,0,11,1,0,4

												Another game I had quite a bit of fun with. It's really nothing you haven't played before, even when they tried to switch it up some.  The voice acting is pretty good and so was the story.  The urban wreckage settings made for some good gunplay versus your Korean counterparts. Special shout out to the in-game product placement, which is by far some of the most blatant I've seen since ""Casino Royale"".  Well, I guess they needed to get help funding it from somewhere.

												This isn't accualy a reccomendation but more so a DO NOT BUY!  the campaign took me a total of 5 hours to beat.  There is nothing cool about this game at all.  The storyline was pretty good but they leave you with a cliffhanger that i saw comming.  The gameplay is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at best.  you don't crouch behind cover you have to lay down for it to be of use.  The AI is fairly dumb they can take a mag or two from your gun but you can only hold about 3 mags at a time and the guns are a plenty except that they carry 5 different types of guns that do not take the same ammo.To sum it up.  Im not impressed.  Call of duty has better gameplay than this a longer storyline.*Spoiler*Ending: You may have turned the tide of the war.  That is all,  no debreif or anything not even a  sum up of the events that happened			",273,25,2,46,37,0,56

												I bought this game 90% for the SP... keep that in mind. I have enjoyed the SP so far, about 85% done. The game runs great, but there are some times that the FPS drops to 25ish, but this is only for around one second or less. The game looks great in SP and the atmosphere is great. The sound is crazy. The weapons sound great, but the voices can be really quite then crazily loud for a little bit. Also, the voice overs can often be out of sync with the facial animations.As for the MP, it is kind of BFBC2 scale, CoD gun handling, and Counter Strike/Crysis Wars currency system. BFBC2 is IMO much better, but there is some fun to be had in Homefront's MP. I have only spent 30-45 minutes in the MP so far and it seems I'll only continue it past the 5 hour mark when I'm with friends.If the game were $60, I would say pass. If you are on the fence, wait till it is $40ish. If you are fairly interested, get it and lets pwn some noobs online.4/5			",384,54,8,12,17,5,16

												The single player portion of this game takes about 4-5 hours to complete the first time through. The story is disturbing because it depicts of what is going on right now in our world. It really opens your eyes to what blessings you have to live in a country were there is freedom to choose. The graphics are very detailed. The sounds in the game sound great. The overall game is really in-depth and very well done. The online portion is really alot of fun and the community isn't that hard to beat if you are used to First Person Shooters. This game is awesome and if you are ready to open your eyes to what the rest of the world is encountering right now then play it. Just don't forget that there are always people worse off then you.

Game is a bit buggy but some of the best dedi servers ive seen since the good old counterstrike days, you shoot someone they die. if its laggy they die a second later but still die. The game is lacking on some content but iam sure they will do DLC or ( Hopefully ) and full expansion.

												Homefront is a game which has a alternative new future setting you are a pilot by the name of Robert Jackson freed by the resistance to help against the uprise of the the oppressive Unified Korea .The story is with out a doubt amazing where North Korea occupies South Korea creating the Unified Korea and then goes to conquer the rest of Asia , there is tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia , and over Iraq but is only mensioned not shown in game , now due to Unified Korea occupied America and due to uprising againt your oppressors they kill more innocent people.Now the gameplay is not absolutle new or innovative which makes it extremely generic , the guns have very few recoil which makes gun very easy to use hence nothing is challenging and weapons feel very similar none seem unique , health regenerates really fast making cover rarely usefuly as poping in and out of cover is enough to regenerate your health fully, besides that the campaign is only 4 hours long .But the thing that makes the game very boring is how scripted the events are and how there is only one way to do things and its how the game makes it ,and how the pacing of the game is really off and you'll never feel any type of immersion or emotions off the game , the game's way of present the story is really bad that you don't care about any of the main characters and suprisingly none of them care about you the ending is very bad which makes it very clear they wanted a sequel, another thing is how bad the game makes use of friendly A.I. how you must always walk behind them so they open door , or climb ladder is just a waste of time.The multiplayer has a few innovation in their introduction of battlepoints a currency used to purchase vehicles or equipements is a good concept but poorly executed because when you have a few enemy helicopter on top of your spawn it just fustrating to the people spawning as they will die instantly and have no chance to destroy air support till the round or end game ends and due to the low recoil weapons long ranged combat easy and, how some maps dont have enough cover which make sniper very prevelent.In the end the Homefront is a game which doesn't have enough innovation to diffrentiate it from others from the genre , the story is great but the the way it is presented makes an under-par game.

I can recommend it at the current price of about $5, i would never suggest somebody buy it for full price however.The game is very short, which isn't the part that bothered me. The gun play is what bothered me, how enemies act, how bullets act etc. Guns shoot exactly where you point them, There doesn't feel to be any sort of feedback, it just feels lacking. Enemies seem to be able to shoot through walls and anything you're hiding behind, and if you move just a bit they'll tear you apart. Additionally, grenades seem to spawn directly on top of you, enemies will never miss a grenade throw.It's a shame that the mechanics in the game felt so poor compared to other shooters, because the story was quite good. I finished it because of the story, but i found myself frustrated a lot more often than i should have been.			",161,23,5,14,15,0,13

												Homefront had too much of hype. A dated control scheme and needlessly difficult and infinitely respawning enemies hold the game back from it's full potential. Aside from a few other glaring technical issues with an aging engine, the game is somewhat solid in singleplayer but never really takes off. The compelling storyline never really gets off the ground in terms of the big picture and feels more ""a day in the life of crappy, unrelatable player character fighting for the resistance movement."" The guns are pretty and make a nice bang, but the Korean soldiers are impossibly better shots than you. Any step out of cover, at all, results in bloody-eye syndrome until you die or take cover. There are some tired mechanics Homefront uses that I've come to expect from most recent games, but I was promised a mold-breaking, heartwrenching experience. What I got was a slow paced, buggy, and altogether mediocre game from a studio that knows how to do so much better.			",949,289,27,103,75,9,153

												Remarkably similar to ""Frontlines"": Very short (3 hours), continual spawning enemies, odd use of drones. Somewhat less linear, but still plenty of impassable chest-high walls. Product placement is amusing and somehow manages to not be distracting, although I'm pretty sure Montrose, CO, has neither a Hooters nor a White Castle.  Weapon selection and ammo collection is confounding. In the end, it is worth the $15 price of a movie admission, but unless you're here for the multiplayer, I wouldn't put more than that down on it.			",157,20,3,19,15,0,27

												Don't waste your money.  The controls are janky, the graphics feel old and outdated.  The A.I. is terrible.  The plot is non-existant.  I played each one of the multiplayer map types, and they are bad as well.  It would have been a good game back in 2001.The game has no depth and **spoiler alert** the last battle acros the Golden Gate Bridge is horrible, very Serious Sam type feeling.  If you are going to include landmarks in the game, at least build them accurately, including the land around it.Also, the 60's music when you are riding in helicopters is completely played out in video games; to which this one has, with absolutely no reason to be included in the plot line other than a vietnam-era feel when you are flying.1/5			",679,182,12,83,50,6,98

												A game made of cliche elements. Nothing really stand out more than the ultra-linearity and lack of interesting environments. The game is so linear that you´re supposed to obey this other guy all the time and if, by any chance, you want to walk ahead of him, an invisible barrier will block your way. Taking decisions is not allowed either, as if you want to approach an assualt using a different tactic than the one your smart boss proposes, you get an instant kill. You don´t even get the chance to open doors. Everybody can push obstacles and open doors minus you.The only  reason of why getting this game is justified is that you ran out of games to play and it is in a super offer. ",143,6,9,4,7,1,6

												I was really looking forward to Homefront when it was announced back in the day, and I pre-ordered it almost as soon as I could.BUT, when the game was finally released.... It was a disappointment.. The story had so much potential, but the game didn't fully use it. Add to that, that the game was way too short, filled with bugs and ended up being a point-and-click-run-in-a-straight-line kinda game, made me feel like it was a waste of money..What people mostly buy this game for nowadays, is for the multiplayer part, but honestly I felt like it was just a copy of all other multiplayer shooters on the marked and it didn't bring anything new, so a disappointment there as well.  I havn't tried it for years, but I doubt that it have been improved much since then..You might disagree with me, but I was way too disappointed to give this game any recommendations and I told everybody I know to stay away from it, and those whom I know had bought it, sadly agrees with me.

												     I expected a lot more out of this game after having it on my wishlist for over a year lol. 7 easy levels..c'moooon....The value of life was promised in the gameplay but to me seemed like any other war game. The beginning scene was pretty grueling to watch but a nice touch, woulda liked to see more as bad as that sounds. As far as multiplayer I took right to it pretty quickly and it isnt nearly as laggy as B:BC2. Noticed a lot of hax servers where ppl were zooming through and pwning ppl once they get in the door with their ultra speed. But over alll nice use of the Unreal engine 3. I wouldnt buy it at full price, I regret doing so. But a good game to have in your collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An interesting background, though bundled with an unpolished shooter. Flawed AI and flat sound effects, along with less than desirable voice acting, leaves the title with wasted potential with its settings, unfortunately leaving it as close as ""just another generic shooter"". However, the narrative inbetween the loading of chapters, and the collectible newspaper articles provide a much more entertaining value than the game itselfHomefront briefly explored the same themes uncovered in Spec Ops (granted, the latter was released a year afterwards, possibly influenced by the former), but it falls short and taken a more traditional approach, leaving the characters under developed, and at times, we just don't really care about what's happening.Additionally, one cannot help themselves but to compare Homefront, and another title from 3 years early named Turning Point: Fall of Liberty (if unfortunate enough to have had played the latter). Of course, Homefront is better than Turning Point, but that's not saying a lot. At the very least, the gameplay is more refined.			",218,63,4,53,14,0,41

												No meio de um mercado dominado por COD e Battlefield, que competem pra ver quem consegue atrair mais pseudo-gamers trouxas o bastante pra pagar 60 dólares por um jogo repetitivo e sem cérebro, além de torrar fortunas em DLCs ridículos, HOMEFRONT merecia um pouco mais de atenção. Seu modo multiplayer está praticamente morto (a developer fechou 3 meses após o lançamento), mas o singleplayer é fácil uma das melhores campanhas de um FPS que eu já joguei, mesmo sendo um pouco curta. Consegue realmente mexer com a cabeça do jogador, exibindo cenas fortes e bem polêmicas, mesmo pra um videogame. Se você não tiver nada melhor pra jogar, vale a pena, sem dúvida.

												Homefront is a game which has a alternative new future setting you are a pilot by the name of Robert Jackson freed by the resistance to help against the uprise of the the oppressive Unified Korea .The story is with out a doubt amazing where North Korea occupies South Korea creating the Unified Korea and then goes to conquer the rest of Asia , there is tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia , and over Iraq but is only mensioned not shown in game , now due to Unified Korea occupied America and due to uprising againt your oppressors they kill more innocent people.Now the gameplay is not absolutle new or innovative which makes it extremely generic , the guns have very few recoil which makes gun very easy to use hence nothing is challenging and weapons feel very similar none seem unique , health regenerates really fast making cover rarely usefuly as poping in and out of cover is enough to regenerate your health fully, besides that the campaign is only 4 hours long .But the thing that makes the game very boring is how scripted the events are and how there is only one way to do things and its how the game makes it ,and how the pacing of the game is really off and you'll never feel any type of immersion or emotions off the game , the game's way of present the story is really bad that you don't care about any of the main characters and suprisingly none of them care about you the ending is very bad which makes it very clear they wanted a sequel, another thing is how bad the game makes use of friendly A.I. how you must always walk behind them so they open door , or climb ladder is just a waste of time.The multiplayer has a few innovation in their introduction of battlepoints a currency used to purchase vehicles or equipements is a good concept but poorly executed because when you have a few enemy helicopter on top of your spawn it just fustrating to the people spawning as they will die instantly and have no chance to destroy air support till the round or end game ends and due to the low recoil weapons long ranged combat easy and, how some maps dont have enough cover which make sniper very prevelent.In the end the Homefront is a game which doesn't have enough innovation to diffrentiate it from others from the genre , the story is great but the the way it is presented makes an under-par game.

Homefront brings that scenario to a FPS game that pits you against North Korean soldiers on your home town turf.Some of the imagery in this title may be a bit disturbing, but, everything here is to produce a more authentic story to the player.Fantastic game that should not be missed.

In short the campaign is a 3½ hour short butt-ugly scripted suckfest with only a single mission worth mentioning to your mum.In multiplayer the snipers are massively overpowered and every game is full of players lying prone in the back of the maps.

												I would recommend the game given the fact that the sequel is on its way.The game is technically outdated, the game mechanics while being a copy paste attempt from call of duty, is poorly executed.But the story is quite compelling, especially if you liked the red dawn movie. The multi part is quite fun if you find some populated servers, which is quite hard nowadays given the age of the game.The last mission is particularly well done however.Rating : 13/20 (play it for the story part, so that you have the context for the second game)			",95,6,0,12,0,0,16

												I'll be honest, it definitely has a short campaign and the story is a tad far fetched. It doesn't reinvent the wheel in terms of gameplay for an FPS, in fact it sometimes seems downright stupid. It is, however, a fun game that I enjoyed while it lasted, and it's not like you'll be blowing 60 dollars on it. Do your research before you buy it and you can decide whether or not you'll enjoy it.			",148,15,4,10,5,2,5

												A CoD-style single player, not at all a challenge but instead you are simply zerged with poor AI enemies until you slowly make your way to the objectives.Fun, but only a couple guns to choose from and the game is VERY short. I beat it in 3 hours on my first playthrough >< you do have a few companions throughout the game, which thankfully they don't get annoying / in the way too often, but they arn't much help either...Overall, strictly for the singleplayer I'd say this game is not worth it. Nearly a spot-on clone of other similar run-and-gun games but far too short and linear.			",221,10,4,17,10,0,27

												Campaing was bad. Horrible to be honest. The only strong part was (spoiler alert):Where the family of a child was killed infront of him.Characters are bland, the ending was crap which tried to make you feel sad but failed too. So what is campaing about?Our main character is a good pilot so the rabels need our help. You fight your way to the heli and use the heli to bring victory (as if a heli by it self should be able to but its just nitpicking I spose)When it comes to multiplayer it is battlefield vehicles meets cod's infanitry combat. Guns aren't soo balanced but its not a big matter. I can't recommend this game if you are asking for a good fps. And multiplayer itself is not good enough to excuse the singleplayer. Also Its not soo original or great eighter. But there isn't much players left eighter. I'd give 59/100.			",171,31,3,15,8,2,11

												The Singleplayer is really short in this game, it only takes about 2-6 hours to finish. The Multiplayer is pretty good, and is a good mix of Battlefield and Call of Duty. I would have liked to see better physics, bullet holes when you shoot objects, and destructable environment such as buildings like in Battlefield. Although it wreaks of a console port, the PC version boasts some DX11 features and advanced graphic effects such as Bloom, Motion Blur, Depth of Field, etc.			",91,4,0,4,7,0,5

												Campaign is really short, but the story is very good. Here's hoping Homefront 2 can continue this great story. When I got this game years ago, I tried the multiplayer, which made a good experience, being, in my opinion, a better one at that than Call of Duty, which I would compare it with in terms of gameplay. While I paid the premium price of €50,- for it, I would never do that again. It wasn't worth that price. But not looking at the price, the game is pretty nice.Since the online community is pretty much dead by now, I would no longer get this game if you still haven't gotten it.			",255,45,5,32,25,6,52

												The FPS aspect of the game is solid but a little buggy.  NPCs sometimes get stuck leaving you in the middle of a mission when they are supposed to be setting off the next scene etc..  The ending was abrupt, no story cliff hanger and no questions answered.  Simply the story has potential but ends nowhere. The strength of this game is in Multiplayer but only time will tell if it offers enough to stay popular.  Right now its 'the new thing' so its doing well online.  Lets see if there's some DLC for it offering a little more in the way of chapters.			",111,19,0,17,5,2,20

												Homefront's kind of... well, mediocre. The campaign is only four hours long and the multiplayer is a poor man's Battlefield clone. I did find myself moved at certain points in the campaign, but that seems to have been the idea- the man behind Red Dawn wanted to scare the pants off of people by making them think an invasion by North Korea was not only possible, but a very credible threat, and depict what would happen as a result. It's an engaging story, but it kind of falls apart when you stop and think about it long enough. Plus, heart-wrenching though some scenes were, they feel like cheap attempts to elicit tears in the end. Maybe that's the real horror of it, and this game is just about shock value. I dunno. It was if nothing else a competent single-player FPS with some good wow moments from the helicopter level and the guilty pleasure that is Goliath, autonomous♥♥♥♥♥♥wrecking attack drone.

Prepare to have a sky full of bombers, machine gun drones and UAV guided missiles. Poor footsoldiers and sharpshooters can't live too long.

												Unfortunately where Homefront had tremendous potential it completely dropped the ball in virtually every other. I really liked the story, especially since I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area where some of the story takes place, but that's where my positive thoughts for Homefront stops. How companies get away with only providing 4 hours of content now is beyond my understanding. The controls are clunky and you have to repeatedly press buttons to crouch and prone instead of holding them like I am used to. The mechanics are extremely unrefined - you can blast enemies in the head repeatedly and they won't die. You can barely peak out from a corner and an enemy far away can pick you off. The game feels too rushed and unpolished, and if they had taken the time to iron out everything and make the campaign longer, Homefront could have been a really good game.But I do feel like the potential is there especially with it's great concept of a story - perhaps if Homefront 2 ever see's light, it will be refined and polished and provide us with more substance to allow us to really get into the game.

												Don't waste your money.  The controls are janky, the graphics feel old and outdated.  The A.I. is terrible.  The plot is non-existant.  I played each one of the multiplayer map types, and they are bad as well.  It would have been a good game back in 2001.The game has no depth and **spoiler alert** the last battle acros the Golden Gate Bridge is horrible, very Serious Sam type feeling.  If you are going to include landmarks in the game, at least build them accurately, including the land around it.Also, the 60's music when you are riding in helicopters is completely played out in video games; to which this one has, with absolutely no reason to be included in the plot line other than a vietnam-era feel when you are flying.1/5			",679,182,12,83,50,6,98

												Remarkably similar to ""Frontlines"": Very short (3 hours), continual spawning enemies, odd use of drones. Somewhat less linear, but still plenty of impassable chest-high walls. Product placement is amusing and somehow manages to not be distracting, although I'm pretty sure Montrose, CO, has neither a Hooters nor a White Castle.  Weapon selection and ammo collection is confounding. In the end, it is worth the $15 price of a movie admission, but unless you're here for the multiplayer, I wouldn't put more than that down on it.			",157,20,3,19,15,0,27

												I can't speak for the multiplayer (but honestly can it possibly be superior to BF3's multiplayer?) but this single player campaign was incredibly frustrating.  AI cheats like a mother - shoots through objects, has a ridiculous obsession with shooting at you (as opposed to your AI teammates), has near perfect accuracy, rarely gets staggered.  I mean I could go on and on.  It's rough.  I would not get this game - there are better FPSes out there.			",144,53,0,34,8,0,27

												This game is a peice of crap, yes the levels and visuals are good but when it comes to shooting games its the AI and story that make the game and this game did a terrible job. Such things as: Enemies running to your grenades or standing there like nothing is wrong, Allies shooting at the ground or other objects and not focusing on the enemy, ammo for guns is different even if you have the same gun but a different etacthmernt, some parts of the game do not offer a checkpoint when needed, enemies have too high of an aim system meaning a one hit kill from out of nowhere. After about the 4th level I uninstalled it which I never do for any games (except for the binding of isaac)if you are okay with above then by all means by it but if my review hit home then stay away from this sorry excuse for an FPS			",210,15,0,7,10,0,12

												Can't decide what to play?  Just start playing Homefront while you think about it.  By the time you decide, the game will be over.  I beat it in 5 hours but I also took some time to look for some of the extras, so yeah, it's that short.This doesn't necessarily mean it's all bad.  It's got a fairly memorable campaign with quick fighting and some challenging moments.  The graphics are great, the shooting is tight.As for the story, I'm a little torn.  On one hand, the concept of an occupied America makes the environment engrossing, so the story pulls you in more than, say, most Call of Duty games.  On the other hand the action in some areas is too ridiculous to be taken seriously, counteracting the attempt at an emotional campaign.  And considering you play a freedom fighter with supposed limited resources, guns are f***ing everywhere!  I don't think I ever had less than half ammo in any gun before I was able to grab another and everywhere I stepped I was picking up more grenades.  With all the sh** the Koreans leave lying around, how is it the Americans haven't wiped them out ages ago?Anyways, I got it for like a 1.25, so I can't complain.  Fun, short little romp.  Recommended?  Meh.  Sure as hell not for 20.00.			",169,28,2,27,14,0,46

												Not the best shooter out there, but if you like atmospheric shooters, it can still be very fun.  Although the missions are set on a pre-determined path, I thought they were pretty well executed (the last two missions were especially great). The campaign was challenging enough and short and sweet (7 missions, I finished in about 6 hours). The story is nothing to write home about but at least it was kind of new and original, and for the most part pretty immersive. There's also a multiplayer I haven't messed with too much, because as you would expect from a game this old, it's not very active. If you can pick it up  for less than $5, I'd suggest doing so.

												yet another modern military shooter but with a different story.1. DRM?: nope! although clearly designed for muliplier the single player isn't too shabby +22. broken?: was at launch but unk now since i havent't played it in a long time +exempt3. had fun?: i enjoyed it for a single playthrough of the campaign +13/4 on my scale2011-03-16this is a fun game with a neat storyline.  my issue with this game is the $50 price tag on an incomplete game. though labled as released the game is clearly in beta stage since the sound & animation glitch ALL THE FREAKING TIME.  i'd wager THQ will patch the issues eventually as they have done with other titles (eg supreme commander 2).  oh this game appears to have no DRM.  unless you can't wait give this game some time to become more stable and reflect a more accurate price tag  of around $30.

It trys to be like other modern war shooters, with a sneak mission, a sniper mission, a helicopter mission, humvees, etc. But it just fails to deliver the experience.

												Korea took over the whole of USA, you are in the resistance fighting for freedom. But straight to the pointWhat is so good about this game?This game will make your chills run through your body, nearly everytime, with the great voice acting and really violent scenes, you can feel the real pain of some of the victims of the war. This game will change the way you think about wars. It is completely different than any other shooter. With a great shooting engine, it is a joy to shoot. It might be short, which some people would think its good because it is not repetetive at all, every mission is different and it has different objectives, you will not get bored of this game. Trust me, this is not just a game. Some gamers will wipe their tears off while playing this game. In my oppinion, worth every single dollar.Multiplayer, you ask?It is still running, there is just one server full everyday(not in night) and the best way to describe it, it is like COD but with big maps like Battlefield and added some great tech features which you can use, remote control helis with rockets, rc cars with machine gun on it, and many other.

												A brief review of Homefront's multiplayer:Likes:- Every weapon (besides one) is unlocked by leveling up in multiplayer matches; there isn't really any ""pay to win"" here.- Ground vehicles and the helicopters are far from ""invincible"", though they are still quite powerful. But recklessness will be punished by RPGs, among other counters.- Almost every weapon is viable in some way, so choosing one comes down to personal preference.Dislikes:- The Express 870 Shotgun. Can one-shot in close quarters, has a quick refire rate, and has a disturbing effective range.- No active repairs for vehicles, only the ""Monkey Wrench"" passive perk. And that's the very last unlock.- No 'zoom' feature for your minimap; it's fixed at a relatively close zoom. Your full map can be viewed quickly using a single button, but still.Do I recommend this game? YES.This is Homefront; Home is where the War is.In fact, why aren't you helping to repopulate the multiplayer servers right now?? ",63,2,0,10,10,0,2

The storyline was pretty good but they leave you with a cliffhanger that i saw comming.  The gameplay is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at best.  you don't crouch behind cover you have to lay down for it to be of use.  The AI is fairly dumb they can take a mag or two from your gun but you can only hold about 3 mags at a time and the guns are a plenty except that they carry 5 different types of guns that do not take the same ammo.To sum it up.  Im not impressed.  Call of duty has better gameplay than this a longer storyline.*Spoiler*Ending: You may have turned the tide of the war.

												Played the demo on my ps3 way back before the game went gold. Loved it. Lost access to my console. Saw the sale on here and decided to take the plunge.It's like someone took COD4, added Battlefield's vehicles, and threw in Counterstrike's in-game currency/economy.Feels GOOD man. Just wish the game had full gamepad support, everything works except for the right stick, which oddly enough only functions when aiming down your ironsights. Minor issue, grab this while there's still a playerbase left.I live in the States, I've  noticed that the servers you see populated at night are all high ping and generally unbearable to play on with my toaster laptop (i think they're based in Brazil or some foreign country)...but during the day there's some good old American servers that consistently have solid ping. Go for it.			",144,21,1,54,3,0,6

												Over all I think this is a great game.  It has a really good story, and the multiplayer is similar to a battlefield style game such as large multi staged maps, sqauds, and vehicle warfare encorperated into the multiplayer.  The only things that could be imporved that come to mind right now is that the graphics could have been better for when it came out, and I wish there was more weapon variety.  There is a total of about 10-12 weapons ranging from sniper rifles, to assault rifles and one shotgun that is only obtainable by buying the dlc for it, at a reasonable price however.  Over all though I think this is a great game with a lot of potential and I look forward to the sequal.			",121,2,5,8,4,0,6

												Pretty good atmosphericly, a lot going on in the background so you do kind of feel like you're under the boot of the DKRP.  The premise is kind of dumb, as with the re-make movie 'Red Dawn' it is a little daft to think the events as they're portrayed could happen in reality, ignoring that the game does portray a very realistic looking grim dystopian near future.As for the actual gameplay, it's very generic...definitely not open world, very 'Call of Duty-esque'.  You are guided from one  scene to the next with constant hints as to how to get through the stage.  I'm not usually sold on grahpics alone, but if it wasn't for the immersion that the well crafted gamescape provides the game on it's own would be pretty lame, which is a shame.  Still, I enjoyed it.  It would however, have made a better movie than Red Dawn (not the original-that's a classic).			",93,19,0,37,22,1,36

												While I would love to recommend Homefront, I cannot. In my opinion, I have a hard time recommending this game. I am not a huge fan of multiplayer games, so I mostly bought this game for the campaign. As such, I loved the single player gameplay. I really enjoyed the guns and their physics. Each gun behaves differently, fires differently, aims differently and guns make a clicking sounds when they are empty. I wished they had added more guns, I counted only about eight, I could easily be wrong. Also, the fact I could sprint and reload made me very happy. I really enjoyed the storyline. That being said, it was by far too short. In the last scene, I thought ""Oh goodness, right in the feels..."" Shortly after that, the credits rolled and I silently raged. The ending seems extremely rushed and half done. I found it annoying that I had to use certain animations in the campaign; ladders, crawling through holes in walls, etc. The multiplayer seems to be dead at the moment, could be that I am writing this review at two am.  I found only about six servers, and only one server had players. Five to be exact. Pros:Fun and interesting storylineGuns, guns, guns and C4Sprinting and reloading at the same timeCons:Lack in variations of weaponsExtremely short storylineUnnecessary animationsFew players in multiplayerIf you could buy the game at $5 or less, I would buy it again.

												So .... I know this is a loved game and its a bit dated but i dont want to pull my punches so here goes.Pros:Visually interesting gameVoice acting is decent and cleargameplay is easy and has good continuity (meaning you dont get lost easily)The guns are many and interestingThe plot is current and even in 10 years im sure will still be a ligitimate fearCons:Plot is uninteresting and the writing is also mediocer wich takes you out of caring alotCover system / health system is Call of duty and so many games do it that its incredibly lame to steal identitys from other games.You will be shouted at repeatedly the same exact quotes over and over again (if you are in battle or if you are looking around for ammo they will still shout at you to go through a door or somthing)No sky .... visuals are ground level the sky is a ceiling..... its a nice painting of a ceiling but its unremakableThere is no immersion no matter how bad it is or how many bodys there are i dont care what happens to my characters or to my own character or the people in the city other games do this by enriching the script with storys or giving your own character feelings and emotions but they chose to make it a nobody named jackson with run and gun as your occupationPickups .... newspapers are a way they try and get you immersed but the storys are bland and uninterestingPlot: north koreas leader dies his son takes over and then for no reason takes over japan, south korea and america over after robbing the world of oil from the middle east. Synopsis: This plot sucks .... he did this just because .... here are a list of games and movies that have done this exact thing better: Terminator, Red faction, 1984, Red dawn .... i suppose the worst of this games failings is its a hallway ..... a hallway where i cannot go through any doors even if there open until my AI based teamates go through 1st. An AI that if im in the way will not go through me but will bend space and time to move me. An AI that rarely kills anything and is only there for the story. My enemy is this 1 ruthless korean commando who pops in every once and a while to do somthing to keep me knowing who the enemy is or somthing.I dont ned to beat the game to know this is a boring and unisnteresting game. They stole aspects from other games and took the plot from red dawn and everyone raved for a bit about how good it was .... no this even for the 5 bucks i got it for stinks .... go buy red faction, its open world and choices as well as storyline is more rich and interesting than this will ever be.How it could be better : Homfront 2: Give me a family and friends and make the 1st parts of the game about my role b4 the fighting starts and make me care about my family by beefing up the diologe then kill them and have the commander do it. then have my role in the intro where i was a doctor or a mechanic reflect in my abilitys throughout the game. make it open world and objective based meaning i can at least choose targets and prioritize them. (taking a fuel depo makes other areas not tank heavy or taking a hospital gives me more AI allies) put me in charge by giving me a haven then take it away with real consiquences. Such as the game gets harder and the depots i took get taken back and the secuirity is strengthened at them so it doesnt feel like im replaying areas. Give me allies that i can get to know through a script they get into as we progress through spacific areas. Give me adaptability where my skills can be used to take out tanks by say as a mechanic i know weak points in the hull or as a doctor i can give aid to my allies when there wounded so they can preform spacific battlefeield functions. Sorry i got ranty there but it makes me sad when some games get such great love but are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in a time when games at that exact time where better. Thanks for observing my reviewCheck out fatman and crazygirl gaming for my curator reportsor look through my profile for more interesting reviews or just ask me and wel chat about it.

												Wow what a let down!Keep in mind this is a review from a purely single player perspective, having grabbed this game while it was on sale long after release.While the game shows great promise, introduces some interesting ideas and even works to establish a powerful premise for a quality story, it all proves meaningless. You would think that with the help of the creative mind behind Red Dawn, this type of story would be fully realized and enjoyable but no such luck.Look at my playtime, this is exactly how long it takes to complete the entire single player campaign! More than that, the ending is a semi cliffhanger that seems intent on acting as a springboard to future titles that never happened.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was really looking forward to Homefront when it was announced back in the day, and I pre-ordered it almost as soon as I could.BUT, when the game was finally released.... It was a disappointment.. The story had so much potential, but the game didn't fully use it. Add to that, that the game was way too short, filled with bugs and ended up being a point-and-click-run-in-a-straight-line kinda game, made me feel like it was a waste of money..What people mostly buy this game for nowadays, is for the multiplayer part, but honestly I felt like it was just a copy of all other multiplayer shooters on the marked and it didn't bring anything new, so a disappointment there as well.  I havn't tried it for years, but I doubt that it have been improved much since then..You might disagree with me, but I was way too disappointed to give this game any recommendations and I told everybody I know to stay away from it, and those whom I know had bought it, sadly agrees with me.

												What would happen if Call of Duty and Battlefield had a baby?Well... in terms of single-player it's only JUST above Medal of Honor which makes it only JUST not the worst campaign in AAA title.Nevertheless multiplayer is freaking great, maps are smaller than in Battlefield but not as small as in CoD which makes them perfect for fast paced, action packed, gameplay yet leaving some room for vehicles that fit into it perfectly. If only servers weren't empty...I had a blast playing homefront in multiplayer but it's not worth buying anymore, let it die with honor and hope that a worthy successor will show up in the future.

												I've bought this game back when it first came out. I remember trying it once at the tie but never getting past the first mission because of clunky controls.  After some dedication put into it. I have finally finished the single player campaign.. Which is not really much of a campaign.. The  story was original and has some great vocal intro's but that's where the good stuff ends.. Many awkward moments ingame where you have to wait to climb a ladder, Wait for an order.. Follow a main protagonist that is very slow to getting to his rendez-vous point....  Everything combined it is just a bit worse then your random mediocre FPS..    And tbh, the graphics are a let down as well... Compared to some games from 2007 this is really not good enough.  I wont even say anything about MP mode because nobody plays it.. So thats all the explenation it needs.10/10 I'd rather workout than to play this game again.			",39,1,0,1,1,0,2

Maybe 3 if you try to get all the acheivements, and maybe more if you try the multiplayer.While it is very short, this game is pretty amazing. The combat is a lot of fun, and plays out like a classic hollywood action movie. Very, very cheesy. I wish the story was a bit longer and it had some backstory, and maybe some main character devolpment would be nice. Fair warning, this game is hard as balls, AI is deadly accurate, and this game had me screaming, ""Who the hell shot me no one was there"".			",251,40,3,17,18,1,20

When I got this game years ago, I tried the multiplayer, which made a good experience, being, in my opinion, a better one at that than Call of Duty, which I would compare it with in terms of gameplay. While I paid the premium price of €50,- for it, I would never do that again. It wasn't worth that price. But not looking at the price, the game is pretty nice.Since the online community is pretty much dead by now, I would no longer get this game if you still haven't gotten it.			",255,45,5,32,25,6,52

												Another game I had quite a bit of fun with. It's really nothing you haven't played before, even when they tried to switch it up some.  The voice acting is pretty good and so was the story.  The urban wreckage settings made for some good gunplay versus your Korean counterparts. Special shout out to the in-game product placement, which is by far some of the most blatant I've seen since ""Casino Royale"".  Well, I guess they needed to get help funding it from somewhere.

The game looks great, has a good solid storyline, feels authentic and easily holds its own against the big-buget supertitles.For £15 it is good value, but as a sale item costing £3.74, it's a bargain!

												Wow, that bring good memories! Even tough it's really short at around 5 hours long for the single player, it's definitly a GREAT 5 hours! I can't tell if it aged well, but I'm definitly eagerly awaiting the sequel Homefront The Revolution. For now, I'm awaiting the trailers that should be release at GDC this year (march 2 to 6h).I didn't play the multi-player, can't talk about it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												not a bad shooter. the game was released years ago but spookily enough the Korean occupied american landscape it portrays is becoming increasingly likely given current global climates.the game suffers from typical 'CoD' style shooter issues such as team-mates blocking your path, invisible walls everywhere, inability to progress until your team-mate kicks open a door, etc - but overall if you can ignore the blatant fact that every level is, in fact, a corridor, the game is great for head shot practice.on max detail settings the game looks pretty great. plenty of high detail textures and well thought set design really immerse you in this possible glimpse of the future.Grab it on sale. Worth $5 at least			",521,133,15,53,30,1,54

												For a shooter that has mainly been ignored in the FPD community, I'm surprized on how good it was. The campain was ok, but could be better. I did not like that they pretty much threw you in the world with no backstory on your character or what was going on. Also, the campain itself was short as hell (only 4 hours on normal difficuly, and that includes dying a bunch of times). That being said, the best part about the game in my opinion is the multiplayer which is a mix of both call of duty and battlefield. Its like call of duty in the way that you can go duck around shooting and killing and its very faced paced, and it is like battlefield in the sense that there are multiple game modes, vehicules, big map sizes, and tactic opportunities. I paid 4,99$ for the game, and at that price, it is a MUST buy for shooter fans or casual gamers. Even tough the game is from 2011, it looks beutifull on Ultra settings even with today's standarts. I'd rate it a 9 out of 10. It would have been a 10 if the campain was a little bit better. So what are you waiting for? Get this game now.			",100,11,0,11,17,0,10

												Really doesn't deserve, in my opinion, a lot of the negative critism it got. It isn't a great game by any stretch, though for a straight up shooter it does its job well. Its entertaining if all you want to do is gun down a lot of North Koreans and LOL at the cringeworthy patriotic nonsense it has going on. Put it this way, it sets out what it aimed to do a lot beter than any of the recent Call of Duty titles, though it does lack the polish of those titles. The story is typical pro-'murica patriotic garbage, but is written by the same guy that wrote Red Dawn so that much is to be expected. The multiplayer is very entertaining also. Though I've only played this portion on he Xbox, I have no idea how it is on PC as of yet. For £4, you can't go wrong. I wouldn't recommend buying this at £15 though.			",197,18,1,19,15,0,35

												I beat it in 3.5 hours and there were numerous sections where I died multiple times before progressing, and a few others where it inexplicable crashed and I had to replay a section.The gunplay is boring and often times enemy spawning and placement is incredibly frustrating unless you follow the exact route they had planned for you.Other reviews implied the story or atmosphere was immersive, I did not find this to be true in the slightest.Others claim the graphics can still compete with modern graphics, this is also not even slightly true. They aren't terrible but they are far below current standards.It's not overpriced necessarily but even at $5 I wouldn't recommend this game.			",168,24,0,21,14,0,14

												I had very high expectations for Homefront. I followed it through it's development because I loved the idea and storyline they came up with. The game's story is very short, hence my playtime. You can beat it in one sitting if you really wanted to. It ends abruptly and left with, ""Yay! We just gained a bridge back!"" That's it.There's one thing that makes this game's storyline shine: It's atmosphere. North Korea has taken over the U.S.A. The game makes you feel like that. Your sense of patriotism will peak as you see soldiers, bodies, and the life as you know, gone. The things you do in the story are very memorable. That's what I wanted in the story. Even though it ended abruptly, I enjoyed my time with it.The multiplayer is dead. Servers are gone and not supported since THQ's demise. The multiplayer was great. They had it's own unique system even though there were only two game modes. You unlock vehicles and other items through battleplay, points that you get for doing objectives, killing people, and etc. It had its own polished feel for what it is.The AI in storyline are an issue.They are your key to moving foward and you will find that you are stuck behind them as they clunky move toward a door or something blocking the way that you can't ddo yourself.The story is short but sweet. If you are looking for a short shooter to play. Buy it on sale but not full price.If you are buying from multiplayer, DO NOT BUY! THE SERVERS ARE DEAD.			",113,25,1,17,8,2,8

												Homefront, made by THQ, is a first-person-shooter where you are a resistance fighter in a near-future America, where the North Korean military have occupied your country, and you and the resistance fight for survival.The Good:- Atmosphere: The sense of loss and human suffering is really emphasized, children watching their parents being shot, mass graves, attrocities, done well.- Graphics: while not the most detailed, they are rich and dynamic.The Bad:- Cover: Bullets can not even penertrate a cardboard box, enemies are often only killed when they deliberately show themselves. Not very tactical.- Linear story: Singleplayer is the same, no exploration, and suffers from the ""you do as you're told"" syndrome, much in the same was as Call of Duty.- Overscripted A.I: Trying to go through a door or down a ladder to early and the game will block you, forcing your teammates to go first. Very annoying and common.- Control: 90% of the time you are being told what to do / following someone- Random deaths: You may kill over 100 enemies in a battle, and then die from instantly from something???- Enemies: 90% cannon fodder infantry, the occasional tank / heli that is killed by an auto targeting ally. - Audio: Weapons sound fake, battle music is bland, this is not the game's strong point.- Sprinting: My grandmother could run faster- Ammo: Hardly any can be carried, ammo is not shared between similar weapons.This title was a dissapointment. THQ suffered from the poor sales and performance of this game. The singleplayer is linear, boring, predictable and frustraiting.After only 2 hours, I had enough. This game played so badly, with repeating objectives, poor copy+paste enemies and audio, I uninstalled the game. I did not play the multiplayer, but it looks like a bland mix of CoD and Frontlines. Hopefully crytek does a better job with the upcoming Homefront 2. Score: 3/10 (Bad)			",149,11,4,7,17,0,25

												N.B. Comments below are based on the single-player campaign.It's short, ranging over 7 missions (it took me 5 1/2 hours), but at least these are action-packed and keep you 'entertained'. The missions offer a diversity of challenges, from sneak& sniper to vehicle missions. The weapons are standard fare, nothing out of the ordinary, but they work well with plenty of choice for everyone. Interesting is the Goliath automated vehicle.The setting is interesting, the story is Ok, the characters are ... shallow and contradict themselves often - which ruins the setting and the story quite a bit.Now to the biggest problem with the game: It is self-righteous, hypocritical and takes itself more seriously than it deserves. Accusing the enemy of dehumanizing the people you fight for (mass graves) within the game, but as a game dehumanizing the enemies by turning them into soul-less and voice-less pop-up targets ... And hence it ruins the moral discussion it tries to create from the onset.			",329,97,10,69,58,1,91

												A completely average Post-CoD 4 FPS. While this game doesn't do much of anything wrong, it doesn't innovate or feel unique either. The Campaign is very short, running all of 4 or so hours. The Multiplayer scene is still somewhat active at the time of writing this, but it should be noted that there's all of maybe 6 servers, half of which have a double digit population. I only recommend this if it's on sale, I purchased it @ 75% off ($4.99 USD), and would not consider the full $20 reasonable, unless you think you'll be playing a lot of multiplayer. I only purchased this game for the single player, because the story reminded me of ""Freedom Fighters"" by IO Interactive.			",327,68,10,37,27,4,34

The story is quite laughable when you consider it is supposed to essentially take place in a alternate timeline of our own reality. For a strictly single player experience I would say to pass this game unless you have played every other fps out there. Multiplayer I can't comment on and likely will never bother with.

												Story was good. Pretty much exactly the move Red Dawn. Grapchic were COD-ish, and the MP wasn't for me. But that doesn't take away how good the game was, yeah, it's not the best, but it's still worth a play.			",132,3,5,12,6,0,21

From the way single player ends it looks like they are setting it up to pay for extra content sometime in future, bottom line ♥♥♥♥ them.Edit.

												Disapointing that it was only a 4 hour romp though the great story line of this game. The graphics abd gameplay may not be A1 but the story and enviorment were worth the time. My wife sat next to me (which never happens) and watched me play though most of it cause she was interested in the storyline as well. I have not played MP as of this writing but was very happy with the content given and wish there was much more. Not a game for everyone but if you like storys like Red Dawn then this is a great play!			",207,36,4,19,8,1,27

												tl;dr - An amazing story that suffered from a critically short campaign and a crappy tacked-on multiplayer. Worth it for $20.Homefront has an amazingly rich backstory and a wonderful premise based on speculation of current world events.  I was incredibly excited to get this game immediately when it came out and dove straight into the campaign.  The story was good, if a bit linear.  There wasn't a lot of room for exploration and invention, though the non-interactive elements of the environment looked fantastic.  I let myself get drawn into the the story and setting.I noticed a few critical flaws.  First, the controls were not always intuitive.  When new weapons or situations arose later in the game, there was little to no explanation on how to take advantage of this.  (I had to go into the keybinds to figure out how to pilot the helicopter, for example.)  Some weapons were very under-utilized, appearing useful once or twice but otherwise pointless.The end of the campaign was amazing from a story perspective -- and then simply ended.  That was it.  That's the game, thanks for playing.  I had five hours of gameplay and I'd completed the campaign.  It felt like a solid 'Act One' that had absolutely nothing else to it.That's not entirely true ... there was a multiplayer component that was bland and wholly uninteresting, feeling like something they slopped into the game to claim 'Hey, we have multiplayer!' that flopped horribly.At its current price of $20 I would say this is an entertaining single-player game you can enjoy for five or six hours.  Don't bother with the multiplayer aspect and try not to lose your mind over the sometimes awkward controls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, yes, this game is a bit of a COD clone to say the least, but it's worth a buy now. As COD is no longer this sort of game with proper boots on ground warfare and a solid shooting engine. I love games where I find it fun just to shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥ I love that in games. COD isn't that anymore, it's all ♥♥♥♥ing space warfare.Campaign-Short, only four hours to play through on normal, which is only 2 hours shorter than the campaigns of the Modern Warfare series.Story-It's alright, not great, just alright.Shooting engine/mechanics-brilliant, very nice to useVariety of weapons-weapons to suit all playstyles...just.There are 2 shotguns on their own that I can think off, and an underslung one.3 different sniper rifles, and also a single fire battle rifle.One choice of pistol.LMGs with choices of optics.Many many choices of assault rifle, with different optics.These Optics include-three different red dots, ACOGs, Iron Sights (so none), and holographic sights. That's all i can think of right now, there might be more.A couple Rocket Launchersand grenades and C4.That's all I can really say, I recomend picking this game up in a sale, it's worth it for a reduced price, but not for full retail price. Or pick it up in a humble bundle like I did. Worth playing definitely, not at full price though, wait for a sale.			",266,37,7,19,17,1,31

TL;DRHomefront is an FPS, with a good/imaginative story-line, good voice acting, good graphics (for the time - 2011) and will keep you hooked until the finished. Not so good: You're stuck on the path the game dictates - can't explore too much...Veridict: Buy it on saleThe long versionHomefront is an FPS, released in 2011 and it's story-line is set in a near future, in America...The North Korea, somehow gets the hold onto a huge nuclear arsenal - then conquers their south counterparts, and forms the Greater Korean Republic (GKR)... It then continues to conquer/embrace other Asian countries to their ranks, enlarging their army and power...After creating an massive satellite - for ""peace"" - they shoot an EMP through the North America that leave it's people completely on the dark... And an invasion from the GKR then follows...And it's here, two years after this, that we start, in Montrose, Colorado...You will join a resistance movement that will try to fight back the Korean occupation of the USA.Note: I didn't find any glitch or problem in the game - like other users have mention...Pros:- Story - It's an imaginative story - and that's what games are for - to entertain us and open up our mind to other possible realites..- The scenarios and locations;- The graphics (for 2011);- The shooting system;Cons:- The ending of the game;- The length of the game;- Can only carry two guns and four grenades (for other people this can also be a PROS			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played this game, both the entire Singleplayer storyline and the Multiplayer. I would have to say it didn't end up being the best of quality at all. But it is something different. It is something to try out besides the usual Call of Duty and Battlefield series. Now, don't buy this game thinking it is going to be epic, because it isn't. But it sure can be fun if you decide to overlook the imperfections of the game.For your info the devs of this game ""THQ"" Went out of business and sold there title to Crytek. A sequel is currently being made and I sure hope that the quality will be much better in which I do believe it will, as Crytek has a lot more resources to put into it. But if you plan on getting it in 2015, then I for sure suggest that you purchase this installment to get the storyline.You can get immersed into the singleplayer storyline if you want to have a good time. Just don't be too critical of like oh that episode is missing things and such.And Multiplayer is still active that I know of. I played it and it can be quite a bit of fun. Maps are fairly open like Battlefield with a little bit more of a COD gameplay. It is a decent mix and a good change to have. So add the game to your collection and have fun. ",69,4,1,2,13,0,18

												NO, I DON'T RECOMMEND this – This game reeks of XBOX port. Not quite to the level of ‘chest-high-walls’, but it lacks any depth beyond the ‘shoot whatever moves’ concept that would otherwise appeal to console gamers. I’m a PC gamer; chances are: you are too. And, while that doesn’t make us superior by definition, it no doubt helps us realize when we are being pandered to like idiots. I recently bought Metro 2033 and this; and the contrast of excellent storytelling and immersive environments to this all-too-generic console-port-shooter was nauseating. Granted, I didn’t make it beyond the first level, but any game that has me simultaneously pulling off headshots and contemplating weather or not to Alt+F4 instead of pulling the trigger is doing something terribly, terribly wrong. I was expecting a great deal from this game – it’s a fantastic concept that really hasn’t been explored in the industry. Unfortunately, while the concept was novel, it was poorly executed.

												So I bought Homefront for $7.49 as part of the Steam Holiday Sale.  Even with many of the reviews I've always wanted to play the game, and the price was definitely right.  That was earlier today.  I've already downloaded it, played through the entire single player campaign, and had a good go at multiplayer.  Here's what I think.The single player campaign is actually really quite cool.  Too bad it's 4 hours long.  The thing it feels most like is a game that was made to become a movie.  Kinda like a lot of books are written.  Not quite what they should be, in order to pave the way for something else.  From the guy who created Red Dawn, I guess we shouldn't expect more...  So there, single player was a lot of fun, and way too short.Multiplayer is simply♥♥♥♥♥  After several hours of play, that's the only reasonable conclusion.  There are some good ideas here, or rather they've borrowed some good ideas from others.  That said, this multiplayer fails in every way.			",75,29,0,15,5,0,3

												I beat this game pretty quickly. As far as the single player campain goes; it's very tedious and everytime you die it will feel like a cheap and random death. It plays like the older call of duty games pretty much. All in all, I found it easy to beat in spite of many aspects fo the game being very counter intuitive. Some parts of the story are pretty graphic, so kudos to the devs for not holding back and delivering a look at what an occupation might actually be like instead of sugar coating it to be politically correct. I think the 20 dollar price tag is a bit steep for such a short and rough around the edges game. If you can get it on sale and you like shooters, I reccomend it. 6.8/10			",140,13,0,43,4,0,25

												Fun game with a great story. At first it seems a bit too similar to Call of Duty with lots of action and twitch shooting. The best parts of this game's story and world are the locations that are peppered with war drama and well executed scenes that show you all the nasty sides of conflict that most modern shooters hide under the rug. While the single player portion of the game is very short it is worth it if you pick this game up at a discounted price. It only took me about 3 hours to finish it but there are lots of collectibles that warrant additional runs.The gunplay is a bit underdeveloped as I feel there is almost no impact to the weapons you're shooting with. Aside from that explosions pack quite a punch and the graphics, for the most part, look good. The character models seem a bit too colorful for the faded world around them and the soundtrack could have been a bit better.			",125,16,0,9,2,0,13

Great useable vehicles to rain destruction with and also the subtle differences to the usual muti player modes make this game stand out and be different in a good way.			",51,2,0,0,4,1,0

Juega a homefront, para mi la mezcla perfecta, Jugabilidad rapida, frenetica y directa de Call of Duty con vehiculos y mapas grandes y abiertos a lo Battlefield. Recomendado 100% para su Multiplayer (Quien busque modo campaña no lo recomiendo) Su modo campaña es muy bueno en ambientacion y situaciones y trama, pero pesimamente llevado a cabo.

												It just doesn't feel special, it's an ordinary FPS which makes you participate in a guerilla war against North Korean soldiers in the United States. It sounds interesting at first, but it really isn't delivered all that well. The writing for the game was decent, but the gameplay just felt so bland and boring that it nullified the quality work put into the story. Plus the game took me less than four hours to finish, that's pretty quick in my opinion.			",105,10,1,7,15,1,44

												$20? You serious? Still? I got this game near release ages ago. In fact, I got a hard copy! I was a victim of the hype train. I don't know what it is, it's just refreshing to see a game that doesn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you with American propaganda. Or, you know, that's what I thought. I didn't care how unrealistic it was. A realistic scenario is the US ♥♥♥♥ed up by making too many enemies and the people it once called friends bailed out. What would be realistic would be a situation where a bunch of countries bully the US and nobody else wants to get involved because of one reason or another. Instead, this game explains nothing of the sort. You are victims to an invasion by North Korea of all people.This wasn't a bad idea. Russia is kinda cliche and, at the time, North Korea was kinda being pissy towards the US. I mean, they still are but that is besides the point. A lot of whiny people will complain about it being North Korea and how unrealistic the game is and stuff. You know what, you're right. However, so is pretty much every other good game out there. They're games, not simulators. Just enjoy it for what it's trying to be, not for what you're looking for. (this is incredibly hypocritical of me to say, but I'll keep it in here to exploit its context).The atmosphere is, again, great at first. You're hyped for how you're gonna survive against the big bad wolf, you're the underdog trying to live in a place you're no longer welcome to be a part of, despite being a citizen of that very place. Just as you're really starting to enjoy it all, it ♥♥♥♥ing ends. It's a VERY short game. Like, it's not even three hours long if I remember. Top it off, it takes a random direction that takes away the satisfaction. Here I am, enjoying the whole ""Terminator: Salvation"" feel of it all and then, suddenly, it becomes a generic FPS game with American propaganda. I wont spoil it, but everyone here that has played it knows what I mean. I feel it could have been better to expand upon surviving as the victims of suppression rather than being the badass underdogs that don't fear anything.  Some of the story felt pretty dark though, especially for its time. I really appreciated it, because it made me feel things at the time that most games can't make me feel. I sometimes felt a little sad, other times I felt a little disgusted but invested. These feelings, it's all evidence we have a good writer that had a part in this game's creation. However, the game is so ♥♥♥♥ing short that it's also unsatisfying. It's like, I have seen movies that told more story than this damn game. It's like, it had you craving for more and then suddenly the game randomly changes context and direction, changes rythm and momentum. You feel like you're craving so much more afterwards. You want more, but you cannot get it from this game. It's sad how empty you feel after beating this. You really do ask yourself immediately afterwards ""is that it?""The gun gameplay is, at least for its time, acceptable. It is not revolutionary, it's pretty generic. It's not bad, it's not even boring, it's just not much to discuss. There is times when it feels like it is slowed down, but ultimately it is fine. Online is interesting, however. The gameplay is pretty enjoyable in fact. The online community is practically dead, but it's around and worth the checkout... or at least it was last time I checked some months ago (lol). You get to customize your loadout, like any FPS from 2011, and you shoot people on the battlefield and complete objectives. Then, you get paid for doing well. Like Counter Strike in a way, you get to spend this ""good boy money"" on stuff that normally isn't spoon fed to you. This game's take on kill streaks is money and strategic weapon strikes. You can also spawn a tank or helicopter if you save up, making you sometimes very dominate on the battlefield. That is probably the only problem with online, it's easy for good players to snowball. Ultimately, with the current price tag, this game is a HELL NO. This game is worth MAYBE $5-$10. I'd say even less than $10, maybe more like $8. The content in this game, it's there but you just wont get to use it really. You might play online for maybe three hours, and then campaign you might spend three to four hours. So that's seven hours or so, which means you're paying nearly $3 an hour to play this game. That's ridiculous. 6-7/10Pros-Single player has a strong start, interesting atmosphere to offer.Online is pretty addictingCons-nothing is truely special about this gameIt's strongest points are all gimped by all this game's weak points. Online is practically dead, singleplayer is overwhelmingly half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and short. It has a terribly unsatisfying ending.It's price, what the actual ♥♥♥♥. It's a conspiracy, I swear to god. They don't want anyone to buy this.Yah, I'll say I recommend this game, but what I really mean is try to get it second hand so you pay what it's actually worth.			",648,117,18,55,55,7,71

												Absolutely loved this game, campaign was great. Although it was very very short (only took me 3.5 hours to complete). Loved the concept but they could have stetched out the story a lot more than it went. I was very disappointed when I found out I finished the game, it was kind of a cliffhanger. They did make a sequal which I will have to check out since I enjoyed the first one so much, I recommend this game if you can get it for a cheap price.			",33,2,0,1,1,0,1

												Ah, the great cash-grab that was Homefront. An extremely ambitious (and at times genuinely enjoyable) experience which in the end manages not to live up to its potential.The Good:Voice acting is solid. While it's not the quality people who play COD routinely will be expecting, it's not bad either. Level design is also pretty decent. Yes, the campaign missions become repetitive very quickly, but once you get past the fact the devs are literally recycling the same house roughly 30 times per level, it's easy to ignore.The Bad:Writing. Your character is a silent protagonist, a trope which was proven dead back in 2001 when the original Halo came out, although some developers tried to keep selling the dead horse for some years later and it probably won't ever completely leave the FPS genre. Still it makes it very difficult to immerse yourself in all the WTF things this game throws at you, or care about any of the one-dimensional squad mates you have.Your team consists of Boone, whose dimension is the fact he's your leader, Rianna, who is female, Hooper, who has a very enthusiastic pet robot, and Conner, who is angry. I got four missions into the campaign and this was all I knew of these people, which may not seem surprising until you remember this game only has about 10 missions in it total. The world itself isn't much better. There's a lot of work going into the game's set up itself, very reminscent of the Red Dawn remake released a year later, although that manages to be a far better experience overall. Still, since we don't know anything about any of the characters, it makes it hard to figure out how they fit into the world, and it's therefore very difficult to see what sets this game apart from, say, Modern Warfare 2 or Fallout.Still, I can handle a shallow shooter if at least it's good, but sadly this game fails there as well. A lot of the shooting is just plain janky: my favorite examples of this are the Remingon 870 whose pickup icon indicates a red dot sight, though the sight itself never rendered any time I used it, or the hit boxes for several objects, which are signficantly larger than they should be (i.e., the game treats destroyed cars like completely solid objects, and you can't through the windows or windshields). The firing sounds for a lot of weapons (specifically the Diablo and M16) sound like airsoft rifles, which doesn't help, and most weapons in general feel very bland (particular note goes to the Chinese AK, SCAR-L, M4, and ACR, which I have yet to notice any significant differences between).The game tries to keep a COD-level of weapons and attachment combinations available to you, but they're mostly the same weapons with the same attachments, which most often don't matter anyway (there's no significant difference between the holographic ""scope"" and ""ACOG"" attachments, for example). The game also isn't quite sure where it wants its difficulty level to sit. The first mission is surprisingly easy, especially for someone who's sat through other similar shooters, but by mission four (the point I gave up) you're fighting enemies who will gleefully kill you through walls using RPGs with blast-radiuses measured in miles. Fortunately, for the most part your character has a lot of health, but this is good because in place of an actual sprint option you're instead given a ""pleasant jog"" which isn't significantly faster than your regular running speed. Worse, you're not able to do fairly logical things, like transition from sprinting to being prone; instead the game assumes you want to completely stop and stand up as straight as you can, apparently in an effort to kill yourself quickly.Homefront is probably worth maybe 20%-50% (if I'm feeling charitable) of its current asking price; for as old as it is and as shallow as it is, there's no reason to spend anything more than $10 for it. Honestly, I can't recommend this. There are simply too many other better shooters out there.			",389,93,3,65,29,3,77

												Too many bugs. Enemies can shoot through the bodies of your team and the enemys can shoot through walls ;-)But i play it at difficulty hard. Maybe the bugs are only at the hard difficulty.The enemys are really clever but with all these bugs it´s a poor developed game.I understand why the publisher THQ and the devs Kaos Studios were closed years ago.But it has a good story and the bugs make this game very difficult to play.Endless (400 and more) masses of enemys in lots of areas because the players has to wait the perfect moment where he can escape to truck - that´s really stupid.Now i know that the game has checkpoint bugs - i lost checkpoints after i was hit.I can´t recommend this game. It has too many bugs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The single player portion of this game takes about 4-5 hours to complete the first time through. The story is disturbing because it depicts of what is going on right now in our world. It really opens your eyes to what blessings you have to live in a country were there is freedom to choose. The graphics are very detailed. The sounds in the game sound great. The overall game is really in-depth and very well done. The online portion is really alot of fun and the community isn't that hard to beat if you are used to First Person Shooters. This game is awesome and if you are ready to open your eyes to what the rest of the world is encountering right now then play it. Just don't forget that there are always people worse off then you.

												Score -> 6/10Homefront got a lot of mixed hits when it released and for a while afterwords. I picked it up on a Steam sale a couple summers ago. Havent played Multiplayer, I dont know if mp still exists, meaning if people still play it. As for single player, its story is very reminiscent of the Red Dawn movies (even has references in game towards those movies, specifically the original). Story wise was good overall and cliche at times.Combat and Manuverability was mostly good. There were a few instances where I personally thought it was a pain in the rear shooting at enemies while you have artillery canons firing next to you. You get screen shocks and your character aiming bouncing around because of it. Its realistic i guess so its not a huge problem. My big issue I noticed with combat, specifically when shoot at enemies is noticably you tend to shoot blanks from time to time. I know sounds liek a personal problem, it may as well be.The save system or lack there of is kind of annoying a certain points of the game, its a check-point save system. Oh the Single Player Campaign is VERY LINEAR. Not an issue if you like your classic FPS titles.Lastly I played it on Guerilla (Hardest Difficulty) on first play through. It is at most a 5 hour game. I cant imagine how Easy would be. *shank... Shank... SHANK SHANK SHANK*			",492,55,16,76,18,0,42

I stood where NPC supposed to be, so it literally run in circles. It was really funny, but I had to move, because if one NPC couldn't get into it's position, another one wouldn't open the door. So it's that kind of a game. For me it's: ""Meh, why not? It's just 5,5 €... and I liked THQ.""			",133,9,2,21,15,0,25

												A solid start, with poor design choices made early on.First, let me say that I bought into the hype when this was released. I couldn't WAIT to get my hands on it. On deliery day it was the greatest dissapointment ever. Multiplayer just simply lacks the people, mechanics or environments to make this my go-to (or even regularly played) multiplayer game. Enjoy getting stopped in the middle of a driveway stuck on something invisible? Enjoy taking a rocket to the face seconds after you ducked behind cover? Absolutely love getting killed before the 'you've been hit' red marks show on your screen? Then this game is your multiplayer paradise... assuming there are anyone populating the servers.With that aside... single player. Holy Smokes this SP tells you a story. There are scripted tunnels of cinematic moments that are meant to evoke emotion, and they do (almost, more on this later). The gameplay is fairly linier, you go forward in a straight line, no room to wiggle or backtrack to get something. Nope, forward it is. However nice the story is, it is objective based. For instance, one of the opening gun fights you're trapped in a gas station trying to clear out the enemies so you can make an escape. I huddled in the station taking stock of things, and sniped out the enemies out by the pumps, turned around to look at something, and BAM! enemies respawned out front. I took my time in that gas station, and after 45+ enemies, I realized they were respawning... But once you move past their spawn points, they stop spawning there. Cool effect to move you along in the story, annoying as heck if you're looking for the hidden objects.Now, the cinematic lock down sections. I get it, you're trying to tell a story. Thank you for attempting to inject story into a genre that lacks it. However, if you're going to lock me in a bus for the first 3 minutes of the game... make it a cinematic I can skip. Please. For the love of all things sacred. Let me skip watching people being executed on the streets.			",325,115,7,41,18,0,55

												This game was just awful. The controls were awkward and the gameplay, even when it was okay, was stale and unimaginative. If you played the original Call Of Duty in 2003, you aren't going to find anything new here. The storyline is even worse. A lot of companies like to advertise scenarios as being 'chillingly plausibile, but the story in this game is crazier than Tom Clancy and Alex Jones sharing a giant tin foil hat. The characters are as two-dimensional as the developers could have possibly made them. This game's only redeeming quality is the multiplayer, making this the poor man's Battlefield.

												Without external influence, I'd like to personally assert that Homefront feels to me like THQ's answer to Activision's Call of Duty. You can bet your dollar that Homefront boasts a very similar action oriented campaign and multiplayer littered with perks and kill streaks.However, Homefront isn't complacent with just lifting the best features from its competitor; it bears intention to improve them. While THQ's efforts are appreciated, these additions are not as polished as one would hope.Starting with its 4-5 hour campaign, the plot here is more emotionally driven. Death is vividly depicted but its repercussions, unfortunately, not fully explored. The characters are multi-dimensional enough to be unique, but play too small a role.The multiplayer is a blend of Call of Duty and Battlefield, mixing fast paced firefights with vehicles. If you've played either of the aforementioned franchises, then you've played Homefront.Homefront isn't bad, but neither is it great.Grade: B-			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												An intense but short single player campaign plus an addictive multiplayer mode helped make Homefront the first true alternative to the repetitive Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises. With drones, vehicles and a range of creative 'infantry abilities' combined with an innovative 'battle points' system, the competitive multiplayer mode in Homefront is truly outstanding.Add this one to your catalog!

												Homefront, made by THQ, is a first-person-shooter where you are a resistance fighter in a near-future America, where the North Korean military have occupied your country, and you and the resistance fight for survival.The Good:- Atmosphere: The sense of loss and human suffering is really emphasized, children watching their parents being shot, mass graves, attrocities, done well.- Graphics: while not the most detailed, they are rich and dynamic.The Bad:- Cover: Bullets can not even penertrate a cardboard box, enemies are often only killed when they deliberately show themselves. Not very tactical.- Linear story: Singleplayer is the same, no exploration, and suffers from the ""you do as you're told"" syndrome, much in the same was as Call of Duty.- Overscripted A.I: Trying to go through a door or down a ladder to early and the game will block you, forcing your teammates to go first. Very annoying and common.- Control: 90% of the time you are being told what to do / following someone- Random deaths: You may kill over 100 enemies in a battle, and then die from instantly from something???- Enemies: 90% cannon fodder infantry, the occasional tank / heli that is killed by an auto targeting ally. - Audio: Weapons sound fake, battle music is bland, this is not the game's strong point.- Sprinting: My grandmother could run faster- Ammo: Hardly any can be carried, ammo is not shared between similar weapons.This title was a dissapointment. THQ suffered from the poor sales and performance of this game. The singleplayer is linear, boring, predictable and frustraiting.After only 2 hours, I had enough. This game played so badly, with repeating objectives, poor copy+paste enemies and audio, I uninstalled the game. I did not play the multiplayer, but it looks like a bland mix of CoD and Frontlines. Hopefully crytek does a better job with the upcoming Homefront 2. Score: 3/10 (Bad)			",149,11,4,7,17,0,25

												A truly unmemorable experience, save the ending fight (which was actually quite fun).  Most of the game was CoD style boring and I felt completely disconnected from the characters and their motivations.  An interesting story idea, but lacked depth.  There were elements of the game which tried very very hard to tug at your heartstrings, but in the end, just kind of got swept under by lack of emotional development.Another yawner FPS.

												Not a cutting edge shooter, but certainly not the worst game ever.No one is ever too concerned about storylines these days, the pretence to this one was unique, but it just felt like a generic America vs Baddies game.In terms of gameplay, unless your favourite weapon is an LMG, or an enemy weapon, you are out of luck, and will run out of ammo every few minutes and have to switch to a pick up SMG. This is one thing that annoyed me most, not being able to replenish assault rifle ammo with another type of assault rifle!Enemies only seem to target you, they are surprisingly accurate too... hitting you 90% of the time, also, every time you pop your head up you will get splashed, and even when behind cover you will get hit - when crouched even if you can't see enemies over cover, they will often be able to hit you -  probably your forehead up sticks out over cover :(Enemies drop grenades beside you with pin point accuracy too, meaning you have to run out of cover into the hail of bullets aimed directly at youObstacles nearly always come in the form of fridges or wardrobes, everytime you go to the next phase of a mission, it will be the main guy Connor (who orders you about the whole way) that pushes the fridge over, and you can continue your adventure. Clipping is also pretty annoying, before you hook up with the military, you have at least 2 people with you throughout, often 3, they will push you out of the way between firefights when you need to climb a ladder, go through a revolving door, etc, you are always last and it is annoying beyond belief! You don't actually get the option to go up/through until they have all passed.All that aside, I enjoyed playing through the Campaign, although it was pretty short, and ended abruptly, I don't think at the end you have really accomplished anything at all. Steam says my time played was 3 hours, I'm pretty sure the multiplayer is permanently offline too. So definitely not worth paying full price for.Summary: you run out of ammo quickly, seems like you are the only target for enemies, poor ending, multiplayer nonexistant			",11,0,0,2,1,0,1

The beginning scene was pretty grueling to watch but a nice touch, woulda liked to see more as bad as that sounds. As far as multiplayer I took right to it pretty quickly and it isnt nearly as laggy as B:BC2. Noticed a lot of hax servers where ppl were zooming through and pwning ppl once they get in the door with their ultra speed. But over alll nice use of the Unreal engine 3.

An excellent choice of weapons to despatch your foes with. A great variety of missions, in a Red Dawn type setting. The action may be over quickly, but it provides more than a worthwhile experience. One that should not be missed. Theres at least two or three replays due to the achievements. And then there is multiplayer (still active).

I played each one of the multiplayer map types, and they are bad as well.  It would have been a good game back in 2001.The game has no depth and **spoiler alert** the last battle acros the Golden Gate Bridge is horrible, very Serious Sam type feeling.  If you are going to include landmarks in the game, at least build them accurately, including the land around it.Also, the 60's music when you are riding in helicopters is completely played out in video games; to which this one has, with absolutely no reason to be included in the plot line other than a vietnam-era feel when you are flying.1/5			",679,182,12,83,50,6,98

												Not the best shooter out there, but if you like atmospheric shooters, it can still be very fun.  Although the missions are set on a pre-determined path, I thought they were pretty well executed (the last two missions were especially great). The campaign was challenging enough and short and sweet (7 missions, I finished in about 6 hours). The story is nothing to write home about but at least it was kind of new and original, and for the most part pretty immersive. There's also a multiplayer I haven't messed with too much, because as you would expect from a game this old, it's not very active. If you can pick it up  for less than $5, I'd suggest doing so.

												This game is a peice of crap, yes the levels and visuals are good but when it comes to shooting games its the AI and story that make the game and this game did a terrible job. Such things as: Enemies running to your grenades or standing there like nothing is wrong, Allies shooting at the ground or other objects and not focusing on the enemy, ammo for guns is different even if you have the same gun but a different etacthmernt, some parts of the game do not offer a checkpoint when needed, enemies have too high of an aim system meaning a one hit kill from out of nowhere. After about the 4th level I uninstalled it which I never do for any games (except for the binding of isaac)if you are okay with above then by all means by it but if my review hit home then stay away from this sorry excuse for an FPS			",210,15,0,7,10,0,12

												Got it because of Steam Sale. Few things to note:1. No high res support for PC! 2. Terrible graphics even at the higest graphics setting.3. Rigid combat mechanics, half way between regular FPS and CoD.4. Game often starts on windowed mode and you have to fix it everytime to get to fullscreen once the game starts.5. Simply terrible. Save your bucks and wait until price drops to 2 or 3 dollars, MAYBE then, you MAY want to get it...or not!			",1084,332,34,105,132,7,150

												If you like COD but want something fresh i would recommend Home front for you to play. Home Front multi player is really awsome because its like COD with vehicles :D   and allso its a bit more fastpace than the call of duty games. Also the HomeFront campaign is a bit shortet then COD but the HomeFront campaign is just SOOOOOOOOOOOO AWSOME with huge explosions and beautiful graphics. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Could be worse, could be better.The campaign is pretty cool, and the feeling while shooting is nice and charging.The multi player alas, is pretty unbalanced, with a points-to-buy sort of killstreaks and powerups for your soldier with no team restriction. Prepare to have a sky full of bombers, machine gun drones and UAV guided missiles. Poor footsoldiers and sharpshooters can't live too long. Too bad for these balancing issues, could have been a far better game.			",125,5,0,11,1,0,4

												I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone really. Very, very short campain (<2 hours) and a disappointing story, plus your hand is held practically throughout the entire game. While I found the story initially appealing and at times throughout the campaign it was somewhat interesting, overall it was disappointing.There are other positives however. I found te environments to be quite well presented, the music was good, and the shooting was very nice.I'd like to comment on multiplayer, but as of now it isn't working for me. If it is ever fixed I may delete and rewrite this recommendation.			",77,15,1,2,5,1,14

												This is a decent shooter. I like the graphics and the story line - North Korea takes over the world - is outrageously unique. It is a short campaign but it still took me awhile because it's tough. You are bombarded at every moment and if you don't use cover effectively then you're dead. It's worth checking out for $15.

												8/10Single Player: Pretty good campaign, it is fun, brutal and enjoyable. The only complaint i have with it is that it is short, it is only 6 hours give or take if you just sit down and play through it all the way as well as having a very abrupt ending that felt more like a cliff hanger than it did a conclusion.Multiplayer: I'm enjoying the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the multiplayer. I'm a person who enjoys battlefield games (as opposed to Call of duty, which i dont care for to much) and homefront, atleast to me, feels like how Call of Duty SHOULD have been made.  Fun vehicles that take no time what so ever to learn how to use (literally) mixed with non stop fluent combat with elements such as Drone combat (remote control drones with guns on them) and Air strikes as well as the Battle Point system.Why do i give it an 8/10?Single player to shortMultiplayer has some issues such as: Sniper rifles being way to OP (nerf coming in next patch)Hackers (VAC currently not working)			",121,1,1,11,6,1,32

												This urban warfare 'in my own backyard experience', was like none other I have played. From the start to the end, I could have sworn I just walked out my door and into this story. Wonderful story-driven events, including a prologue mixture of real world footage, spun together with new ideas, delivers a future that is scarily believable and probable.			",189,107,19,16,7,0,4

												Well, that's what you get, when all the good moments from a movie have been put into it's trailer...Story was promising, screenshots looked tempting and overall idea is great.However, sometimes ""cold start"" is just too ""cold"" - way too much action for the first minutes, when you usually trying to figure out controls.Instead you are constantly firing in ""those guys"" direction, running ""somewhere there"" and sometimes ""take cover"" behind a trashcan being hit way to many times.Arcade ""shoot-them-up"" style might not be the best envelope for serious topic of oppupation and demise of the once great country.

												Story Is so short and shallow, played the whole game in one sitting and it felt like nothing really happend, the ending of the game to me felt like it was just getting into the story, but no such luck. The charecters are bland and boring and the AI makes thins even worse with NPC's running up to walls and standing there for minutes at a time while getting shot by enemy players, who are just as bad as they'll stand there as vehicles are hurtling towards them. Overall the game had promise but totally failed to deliver for me.			",60,16,0,10,5,0,18

												A solid start, with poor design choices made early on.First, let me say that I bought into the hype when this was released. I couldn't WAIT to get my hands on it. On deliery day it was the greatest dissapointment ever. Multiplayer just simply lacks the people, mechanics or environments to make this my go-to (or even regularly played) multiplayer game. Enjoy getting stopped in the middle of a driveway stuck on something invisible? Enjoy taking a rocket to the face seconds after you ducked behind cover? Absolutely love getting killed before the 'you've been hit' red marks show on your screen? Then this game is your multiplayer paradise... assuming there are anyone populating the servers.With that aside... single player. Holy Smokes this SP tells you a story. There are scripted tunnels of cinematic moments that are meant to evoke emotion, and they do (almost, more on this later). The gameplay is fairly linier, you go forward in a straight line, no room to wiggle or backtrack to get something. Nope, forward it is. However nice the story is, it is objective based. For instance, one of the opening gun fights you're trapped in a gas station trying to clear out the enemies so you can make an escape. I huddled in the station taking stock of things, and sniped out the enemies out by the pumps, turned around to look at something, and BAM! enemies respawned out front. I took my time in that gas station, and after 45+ enemies, I realized they were respawning... But once you move past their spawn points, they stop spawning there. Cool effect to move you along in the story, annoying as heck if you're looking for the hidden objects.Now, the cinematic lock down sections. I get it, you're trying to tell a story. Thank you for attempting to inject story into a genre that lacks it. However, if you're going to lock me in a bus for the first 3 minutes of the game... make it a cinematic I can skip. Please. For the love of all things sacred. Let me skip watching people being executed on the streets.			",325,115,7,41,18,0,55
