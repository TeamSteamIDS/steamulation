												 I purchased this game as part of the Saints Row Ultimate Franchise Pack, which was on sale at the time for about $18.  I can honestly say this game has left me completely satisfied with my purchase, and despite having bought the bundle at the beginning of the summer, and played every day, it was at least a month before I even opened Saints Row 3 for the first time, because I was having so much fun playing Saints Row 2, and there is simply that much to do.  With 233.8 hours on record as of my review, I still am only at about 95-97% completion on my first and only playthrough, because it was simply too much fun screwing around.  Even after finishing the story missions, of which there are more than enough to make the game worth buying all by itself, there was still so much to do.  The controls took a bit of getting used to, but only at first.  After a short while, any oddities control-wise felt completely natural, which is far from always the case when talking about ported titles.  The only thing I could recommend a controller for would be the driving/piloting.  While driving ground vehicles, the WASD keys don't quite give you the best experience, but they work perfectly fine for it.  The main complaint I had about the game in general were the flight controls, which were awkward at first, but even after getting used to the layout, which wasn't that strange, it still lacked the ability to make small adjustments without losing control, unless you practice a lot. (I practiced a lot though, and mostly was able to work around it.) I got so accustomed to the keybindings in this game that I actually changed most of my SR3 keybindings to match (where they were different at least) because I found I honestly missed many of the default keybindings where they had been changed.  Still, using a console controller for the air vehicles is probably your best option, if nothing else.  The graphics are far from amazing by current standards, but considering the time the game was made, they're perfectly solid, and the water still looks more real than watch dogs (you actually have a wake in a boat! HOW ADVANCED!! Sorry had to. considering I got this game in a huge bundle for only 18 dollars, I am not only satisfied, I would gladly have paid $18 dollars for this game alone, if I evaluated the value of the game solely on the amount of fun I had playing it.  All in all, I fully recommend this game and hope others enjoy it as much as I have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best Saints Row game made to this day.. The others are bigger and crazier but this one is the real deal. It has the most alive city. There are lots of different individuals. People, constructions, cars and general theme changes from district the district. So you never get the feeling of hanging around same place over and over again. Story is what it should be in an open world game. Three enemy gangs and you want to end them all. Simple. But the way they present it with missions is really impressive. There are lots of touching moments as well as action packed ones. In some mission I felt so angry that I find myself finishing all of the gangs mission in one play.In my opinion GTA was always very linear. This one has three set of missions that you can do in whatever order you want. And if you are bored from doing it you have tons of funny activities. Customization options are huge. For cars, gang and yourself. There are some crazy and useless ones but you could nearly create and ideal character for your taste. So any cons? Yeah of course. Driving is kinda hard. Cars don't respond right most of the time and you feel driving a paper car or something. Graphics are out of date of course (which is not a problem for me because I have and old computer). Finishing activities can be so much hard sometimes, 6 level a bit hard, 3 is ideal I think. There are some bugs in some missions and graphics but they are not a big deal. And there are some problems with the default controls but I'm sure you can make it work. You get used to after a while.In conclusion this game still has it. It has all the right touches. Yes it is an old game but still one of the best open world game I have played. I give it at least an 8 out 10. It is not expensive. So you should try it...PS: You know what makes this game better, steam achievements.. And trading cards... Ohh I wish...PS-2: I didn't play any other version of the game so I couldn't compare them. But this one worked just nice for my PC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I’m glad I decided to play this game! The only reason I started playing it was because I finished Saints Row 4 and loved it, which made me want more. As it turns out Saints Row 2 feels like it hardly belongs in the same franchise as the fourth game. Volition have truly reinvented the franchise as they’ve gone from title to title, only keeping the characters and setting as they go. This explains why the people who loved the second game and wanted more of that tend to complain loudly about the third and fourth games. They’re just not the same. Personally I think reinventing and iterating are both equally valid approaches for a series to take. I like the variety, and you certainly can’t accuse them of retreading the same ground like I’ve seen some do with Rockstar and the GTA series.Saints Row 2 came out in 2008, and it feels like a game of its time. It might not seem like 2008 is that far back, but when you play games of that time they all feel old now, as does Saints Row 2. At that time I remember games journalists were talking about emergent gameplay instead of story, and it shows in Saints Row 2’s design. Compared to any major game released in 2013 this feels like complete chaos. Instead of the world acting like a virtual movie set with carefully staged combat, the game instead relies on world simulation systems and AI to act on its own. This approach makes it nearly impossible for a developer to tell a story during missions, because the minute to minute gameplay is completely unpredictable. Instead the designer only choreographs the action with commands like: Go there, kill that, chase that car, etc. Even during missions the world simulation present in the free exploration mode is in full effect. So when you take over areas of the map you’ll have friendly thugs spawn there. If a mission happens to take place there, or a car chase goes through neighborhoods controlled by your gang, groups of friendly thugs will spawn and rain bullets on your pursuers. If during a mission an enemy shoots a civilian standing near you, police will arrive on the scene and start fighting the enemy gangsters with you. The last time I saw this kind of three way combat break out spontaneously was in the Stalker games. I wish we had more games like this, especially on the next-gen consoles where the extra memory and power could allow much more elaborate world simulation. That would in some way fulfill “the point” of next-gen hardware. Making something you couldn’t do on 360/ps3, just like this game is something that couldn’t exist on PS2.Anyway, I had a great time blowing through this game. It’s messy, ugly, glitch, but it all comes together to create something special. One thing I was pleasantly surprised by was the quality of the cutscenes. In Saints Row 4 they were generally very high quality, but in a couple scenes I found the sound to be a bit crap. In Saints Row 2 the sound during cutscenes is phenomenal. It’s raw, violent and has about as much impact as you could hope to have. It fits perfectly with the story itself which in the “Brotherhood” missions turns into an ugly conflict where neither side appear noble or heroic in any way. It’s dark, gruesome and I was even shocked at one scene where the game made it abundantly clear that the player isn’t a hero anyone should aspire to be. So I finally get where the hype about Saints Row 2 has come from. If you know you’re a fan of slightly janky games with outstanding qualities you’ll probably like this. Those wanting a slick, modern, controlled experience should avoid it like the plague.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warning: be EXTREMELY careful about this PC port.Although Saint's Row 2 is one of my favourite games of all time, this PC conversion is the worst I've ever seen. It really is that bad. Basically, the further away your PC spec is from an Xbox 360 the worse the game will run. (Apparently fixed on Win 8 machines)  It also has numerous bugs, glitches and other ""issues"" and  requires fan-made modding (seriously; REQUIRES) in order to get it to actually work as intended.I will recommend this game, but only if you mod it to work properly. Google ""Gentlemen of the Row"" and then thank the creator with as much free beer as the internet can send.His Steam FAQ link is here: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1715922 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pros-The best Saints Row game-Great story that strikes a very good balance of comedy and drama.-The gameplay is fun-Good supporting cast-Freedom to tackle the story however you want-Fun side activitiesCons-Extremely buggy on PC. Install the mod ""Gentleman of the Row"" in order to fix most of the issues.-The fact that you need to gain more notoriety through side quest to be able to continue the main mission can become annoying and tedious.By far the best story in a Saints Row game.

												It's a great game but this PC port is awful. Volition fired the company responsible for it, and then washed their hands of the whole affair.  The recently released version available on Good Old Games fixes a lot of the issues, so if you want it, I suggest purchasing it from GOG rather than Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're thinking about getting into the Saints Row series, Saints Row 2 is the best one to start with. If you've already played the later Saints Row games, it's still worth it to go back and play Saints Row 2 (I actually played Saints Row IV before playing Saints Row 2).You start out by creating your character. You can choose your Race, Sex, Body Build, etc. Soon after that, you'll be free to explore the big city. The main story is interesting, but you can also do your own thing and follow the main story at your own pace.Join the Saints!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
