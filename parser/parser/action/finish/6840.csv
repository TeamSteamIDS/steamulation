												Get commandos 2: Men of courage instead.Ok, I am not saying that this game is terrible. I played many many hours of it in the past. But compared to Commandos 2, It's not what it could be.Where commandos 2. Had a smooth learning curve. Commandos 3, throws that over board and just throws you into the deep and straight after the tutorial.Lets compare commandos 2 to commandos 3 for a quick bit.the tutorial of commandos 2 was ok. First one was quite easy, but explaining the basics very well. Then the second one gave you the feeling of a real mission in a smaller setting. Still a little easier than the main missions, it gave a good learning experience of the game. Mainly because not everything was explained to you.commandos 3 tutorial was too simple. You began training a whole long missions learning the basic moves of some of the commandos, all in a way too linear fashion. Then the second tutorial should have been the smaller mission. And it is. But compared to the actual missions, this one is way too easy, and again every move you need to make is fed to you with a spoon.but okay, the main missions are quite hard. they aren't impossible. Just require a whole lot of messing things up.Missions. Hard, doable but okay. their settings differ nicely from eachother. Though the difference could be as good as it was in commandos 2. But what i disliked most, is the linear feeling most of the missions have. Do this, go to that do that again. It just doesn't feel like the past where you had open levels and you could do them in any way you liked.Story wise, they did nicely too. They actually managed to add in 3 stories in the game.one about a traitor, one for the D-day campain. And one about a weapon if i am not mistaken.Not the spectacular stories you would hope for, but it's there at least.Diversity in players is lacking though. I feel that I am mostly just using the same players mission after mission. While leaving some alone. they even cut out some players from the previous game. But why they only used the diver in 1 mission i can't understand.Then we have the gameplay.It's okay at best.As someone who is common with commandos 2 controls this is a whole difference. Because mainly it's the same game as C2. Just with some major ajustments. Some are good, some are bad.Control wise, It could have done better. A lot of the shortcut keys are gone. And I have the feeling to get a different weapon out I am clicking more than I did in previous installments.But that is just knitpicking.Of course there are mods to enable more shortcut keys. It does improve on some mechanics though.Weapon distribution and handling is improved. And the free moving camera indoors works great too.If yhey used these mechanics in Commandos 2, than that would have been a straight A game.But last thing I am saddened about. It doesn't work as well on modern pc's. Commandos 2 still works greatly on my PC. but commandos 3 needs so many changes to the game files to keep it working. It's just not worth it.But to make it short.commandos 3. It is a good game. but only if you are a long term fan of the series. but don't expect it to be as good as commandos 2. My reccomendation. Get commandos 2 if you haven't already. It's longer and has better gameplay.If you already got, and this game does turn up with 75% off. Then it's worth getting. Just so you can feel how it could be better. Otherwise, Just stay a long way away from it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a massive Commandos fan, I don't recommend it. In my opinion it's a step back from previous games. A lot of content got cut out, game is very short and linear, many missions depend on time and force you to play aggressively (even if you prefer the stealth approach). There are a few nice missions, but they seem more like Commandos 2 Bonus missions. After such an outstanding game like Commandos 2, I can't believe why they made something unappealing like this. Only for fans who just need to have a bit more of Commandos (and then probably play previous Commandos games again...).If you're new to Commandos - skip this game, get Commandos 2 instead, later play Commandos BEL and Commandos BtCoD.Driver (okie-dokie!) is missing :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Commandos 2 was just so much better than this. The missions are not fun anymore and they removed loads of my favorite features. Nice graphics though, but all-in-all I didn't enjoy this game as the previous titles because it felt easy and ""blah"" from the opening missions in snowy Stalingrad to the last hurrah on the beaches of Normandy.

												I recommend this game, but only if you have played any of it's predecessors. Why? Because this one is even harder due to improved AI, time limits and fewer shortkeys which is not very beginner friendly but also because it is simply not as good as Commandos 2. The developers removed a lot of features that made Commandos 2 great, such as being able to seach furniture for useful items, bonus levels, difficulty settings and many more smaller things. Sure there were improvements too, like a fully 3D engine and a bigger variety of level designs but this was not enough to make the game stand out from it's predecessors.In short: It's very challenging for Commandos veterans and other strategy gamers but near impossible for beginners who are better off starting with Commandos 2 to get used to the gameplay.Looking at the negative reviews of this game reveals that Commandos 3 might not work for your computer for unknown reasons. If you want to make sure you can play the game without any issues you'd better buy it at GOG. http://www.gog.com/game/commandos_2_3 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm just being a little picky here, it's a great game if you are VERY smart. I really suggest that you get this game when it's about 75% off, but not when it's full price. I'm new to the commandos series and I made a mistake with playing this one first. Here's a little poem I came up with which explains my experience with the game: I love the gameplay, I hate the controls... There's a lot of bullcrap, the Germans are trolls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply put, the worst Commandos game in the series.- Graphics are locked at 800 x 600.  A step backwards from Commandos 2- Too many timed missions.  Commandos is all about planning and playing at your own pace.- Too many sudden events triggered for no apparent reasons, often ruining a level especially if one saved at the wrong time.- Sizes of maps are too small; number of which is too few.

												While no other franchise can present you with so many seemingly insurmountable challenges, no other franchise is able to offer such a feeling of accomplishment once the objectives are miraculously achieved.Make no mistake that it is going to give you absolute hell, yet beyond the initial frustration at your apparent gaming impotence, attempting to penetrate its steely exterior becomes a bizarre pleasure that offers a triumphant sense of achievement.While Commandos 3 is still a strong concept, and most definitely a super-looking game, it's best suitable for the most patient veterans of the series.

												This 3D top down strategy game was once one of the better examples of the genre, unfortunately it's aged too badly to allow a recommendation, despite there being a ""For windows"" released version.Technical problems abound - if you have SLI, prepare for merciless flickering.  The engine is dated and was never made to be scaleable - so you have one fixed resolution, and you can choose between ""high"" and ""low"" quality, and that's it.   Pretty lame, sadly.Graphics wise - while dated, the graphics are discernable enough if you can survive the technical glitches.Gameplay - it's quite playable, although not very fun and the controls now feel really clunky.I think if the developers still have their hand out for Steam cash for this game, they need to put in the effort to update it for modern PCs and fix the bugs.

Yet, I had to stop playing this game as It was frustrating me to a certain point where I started talking to my commando's because they simply didn't obey the orders I gave them. Like.. protect this area. They get shot first, they got the high ground, interior and upper hand.. even a machine gun vs a pistol. But okay.. enough Commando's for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just about everything you do has a time limit. If you played the older games you understand how annoying that is because the very essence of these games is careful planning. The biggest issue though is it removes a lot of the unique functions of your squad members and enables them some (or all) of them to do said action, (before sapper was the guy who could use grenades now pretty much everyone can) which is kinda a big part of what made the gameplay for the old ones so good.

												I played very little of this game, but I can tell already that it is not at all in the vein of the original commandos (BTCOD and BEL)) of which I grew up with and came to love. In the tutorial, The green beret starts non-stealthily walking up to soldiers on his own, so I suppose I am to cover for him, but why? why not let me have full control of my men and the way I play the mission? and the first level is set in a war zone? and you need to take out a sniper before he takes out russian allies? these compalints on they're own are not the issue, but it's symbolic of what ruins this game for me. what happened to observing the situation and the mission in it's enterity then enacting and attempting to execute a proper plan only to watch it go awry and deciding to either go back to a last save or continue with a different set of problems? that seems  completely lost on this game. I will reserve comment for the game itself, as I am in no area to judge it independantly. my complaint is not that it's a bad game, but that it's a bad addition to a franchise I enjoyed before. and If I can get passed the title, I may end up liking it, but I don't think I will be playing it anytime soon.

If I have to spend a lot of time on the details and micromanaging my soldiers than it takes away from the fun of decision making in terms of trade offs.This is what I like: - The artwork is great. - The story telling. - The strategy. - The RPG element.What I don't like: -The tutorial is buggy.   --The tutorial asks me to knock out a guard but skips to the next prompt before I finish it. -Mode based interface.   --Switching from stand to lay down or from cover mode to non cover mode makes my life difficult. For example, if I have soldiers in cover mode but I need to switch quickly to make a shot, I find it very difficult. I wish the game to be able to do that work for me. So I could respond quickly to threats. -Not able to delegate control   --If my solder is not facing the enemy and an enemy approaches from the other side then my solder does not respond to the threat. I would like the soldier to face the enemy and return fire.   --Cover mode does not seem to work for the sniper rifle.   --A soldiers line of site when covering is so small. -Complicated, bad, and time consuming controls   --I find myself getting confused between the control clicking, cover modes, cover areas, ect.   --I would like to not spend so much time trading inventory.   --I should be able to easily exchange ammo between soldiers.   --I should not have to order my soldier to search every body. Instead, I should be able to tell him to collect inventory from a group of soldiers. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am never gonna say a commandos game is bad because these games were totally unique and still are, this one is sadly really short like commandos beyond the call of duty but it has new weapons and somehow it really is more hardcore than others (except than behind the enemy lines) i totally recommend it for both single and multipalyer. The multiplaeyr is UBER FUN if you play as allies vs allies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Commandos 3 is the easiest of the commandos series, and since it’s the latest one it also happens to be the most visually pleasing. There is way more action sequences in this version than Commandos 2, and they solved the issue with easy enemy takedown and unclear objectives. In turn, the game became less strategy and more brute force. Other than the aforementioned fixes and changes the game is for the most part plays the same as Commandos 2. If you like action over strategy play this, if you like strategy over action play Commandos 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I just want to play the game at my own pace....2 works A-OK even though it *along with the first two* have problems with being fullscreen, not that it doesn't work its just a bit strange, sometimes vocal briefings do not work but you can still play *Just good luck figuring things out*WOW...lets stop that train of thought, I was reviewing the third, not the series in terms of performance on Windows 8!But yeah play Commandos, its expansion, and 2 instead.

												This game...has issues. Which is a shame since it is actually really good in theory. Like so many other games, it collapses when let loose into the world. You have a number of specialists - sniper, sapper, commando, spy, thief - who all do pretty much what you expect them to do. You job is to apply their specialties where they are needed. Need to kill something quick? The commando is the man. Need to do it from far away? Sniper. Want to make boom? Sapper. The thief and the spy are the hardest to use, but are also the cleanest when it comes to their job. They can sneak past right in front of enemies, given if the situation is right. The mission is to wreck the Nazis. So you have this great game and useful tools. What is wrong?The controls are not very well organized and counter-intuitive. Even after you learn them, you find yourself scrambling to respond to the dynamic events occuring. The friendly AI also isn't very bright. They take no initiative to respond to attacks.

A brilliantly thought through title that really lives up to the series and is a really cool upgrade from Commandos 2 which, let's face it, was pretty horrible. Every puzzle really brings back that feel of the first Commandos games, with a tiny delay leading to certain death, and many many hours of fun along with it. Would definitely recommend it to everyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played all of the Commandos games. I was a huge fan in high school, and when I saw Commandos 3 on steam for only $4 I immediately bought it. However, upon installing the game, I found that the pixels suddenly go all weird, the color scheme flashes through various, indescribable hues and the mouse cursor begins to track all over the screen. I looked up if there was anyway to fix the problem and Steam was no help at all. I checked google, and many people have had similar problems with no hope of fixing them. Honestly, the game is unplayable in it's current state. Too bad, because it really is a good game. Commandos 2 was better, and worked fine with my Windows 8 system. If you're interested in one of the Commandos games, I'd avoid Destination Berlin, and go with Men of Courage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's surprisingly beautiful for a game from 2003 with a locked 800x600 resolution. The details in the environment, the superb sound effects, the well crafted characters...it's a shame that the game is so punishingly hard, so extremely difficult, so incredibly unforgiving that it is impossible to enjoy without a severely masochistic personality. You think I'm exaggerating? Play it, I ♥♥♥♥ing dare you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow, this is terrible... I remember buying Commandos 1 on disk way back when and having a lot of fun. Commandos 3 attempts to make a strategy based game an action game and fails miserably. Commandos was originally a real-time hexagonal tile based puzzle. Commandos 3 keeps the same element but has tried to infuse more action into the game. It feels too overwhelming. The controls are too clumsy for an action based game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Generally not worth it - it's a downgrade from Commandos 2 in nearly every aspect. The campaigns are short, have rather boring, small and ""one-time"" only levels. The campaign design also makes multiplayer aspect suck. Visuals/technical-wise the game has also aged rather badly and in my opinion it's actually uglier than Commandos 2. Unless you're sucker for the series or are getting it in a cheap bundle, it might be better not to pick it up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Get Commandos 2 first. The learning curve here delicately holds your hand through the tutorial then hands you a live grenade and asks why you haven't defused it yetThe good news then, for veterans of the game, you'll really find your skills pushed here. Time is the big stricture here for many levels, where before you generally had the luxury of ticking off every enemy in your own time. Clearing a rail-field in minutes to intercept a train, with just the Green Beret, was an incredible levelIn many respects, Commandos 3 improves upon the 2nd installment. The levels are smaller, so less onerous. The variety is also pushed so it's not just repetitions of ""clear out this encampment"". Quickly move to the front of a moving train, assassinate a traitor, destroy as many vehicles as possible before they leave the compound...Ironically though, these work against it in some respects. The game is ridiculously short (compared to the previous titles) - there are only 12 levels in all, a handful of which take 5 minutes (if that), so you barely feel you get started with a campaign before it's over. Too many also become a bit ""Commandos and Conquer"" - less about stealth and more playing an RTS of hero units. They were fine in moderation in Commandos 2, but I felt they took up a few too many levels hereBut whilst I say it's probably the least memorable of the 3 titles - The quality and challenge is still definitely there			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
