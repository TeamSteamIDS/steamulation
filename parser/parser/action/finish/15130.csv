												Beyond Good and Evil is one of the most beautiful, amazing and original games the humanity has ever seen. (I really like it)Thanks to it's particular and charming design the game has aged like fine wine(*). While it was released in 2003 it has nothing to envy to current indies or more ""aesthetic"" games. It drives one of the most amazing an beautifully written stories I've ever seen, it's an amazing and original open world adventure game that will keep you hooked for many hours.*While the games is amazing, the port is old and it's engine doesn't play too well in post Windows XP machines without some tweaking. Gladly, we can fix that, when you launch the game, you will be presented with a Settings window (you can find the settings executable in your Steam libradry folder \steamapps\common\Beyond Good and Evil\SettingsApplication.exe), go to Advance Settings and in the Compability menu check ""Manual Compatibily Settings"" so you can manage the rest of the settings and uncheck the following options: Triple-buffering HW Vertex Processing Multi vertex stream W BufferIf you are still having issues, check the PC Gaming Wiki page for Beyond Good and Evil[pcgamingwiki.com] or some of the  Steam Community Guides or Discussions about the game ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The good: -The art direction and diverse cast of characters-Photojournalism is the main weapon of your protagonist, and seeing it used as a concept in a fantasy setting is really refreshing-The protagonists. Without spoiling anything, Jade and Pey'j are a memorable duo, heartwarming characters in general, and there's still plenty of mystery surrounding them. Jade and Double H were a fun team as well, and there seems to be a lot of untold depth to even the minor characters, namely anyone found in the Akuda Bar-The soundtrack The bad:-The camera is sometimes wonky, especially on the PC-It's kind of an extension of the camera problem, but controlling the game's two vehicles can be frustrating in some parts-A little short, could have been one level/mission longer imo, but that's because I really enjoyed what I gotThe ugly: -The fact that this game was a commercial failure, isn't well known even to this day, and its sequel has been in development hell but is well deserving of existing alreadyConclusion: Play this game. It's charming, unique, and refreshing despite being over a decade old.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So here's this game I played several times on the PS2, and it is SO FUN. PC is no exception.People may have seen the camera on the box art back in the day and said to themselves ""Ew! Camera in the gameplay, no way!"" Sure the camera is sometimes a necessary part of the game, but combat and stealth are major gameplay elements that shouldn't be overlooked.The story centres on Jade and Pey'j, in a strange world where half-animal people walk around on two legs and talk. For example Pey'j has a definite boar-like appearance. The world is under siege from the Domz armada, and the Alpha Sections are there to stop them. During an attack Jade discovers she's out of credits and her lighthouse shield power is cut off. In an effort to make some credits she takes on a photography job for the local science centre, and through a turn of events ends up working for a secret underground movement called the Iris Network.The plot is fairly straightforward - you go on missions looking for evidence, once you find the evidence you take photos of it, and then you get the hell outta there. The missions are few and large, and the best way to approach it is to go sneaky stealth mode on everything. It is possible to attack your enemies too, but you will have a hard time.Gameplay combat is all 3rd-person, but not all of it is melee. There are battles on the water inside your 'tugboat', and towards the end of the game there is even a spaceship battle, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Enemies hit hard in melee combat though, so it pays to grab all the health upgrades you can find. These can be manually distributed to your companion too if you think they need it. As already mentioned, subterfuge is your friend - you will have more fun with sneak attacks and trickery than trying to face-tank your way though the game.Other gameplay elements include speed-races to get your stolen credits back, minigames (that game in the Akuda Bar is badass hard), finding all the species to photograph for more credits, finding all the pearls for more vehicle upgrades. There are a couple of foot-chases too, to add whipped cream to an already delicious cake of a game.So how delicious is it? Well the music is a blast for starters. It has a wonderful style to it, melodious and alien. Well-suited to the game. The graphics are a little bland but good - with a main character like Jade it makes sense there's a bit of a green theme to it. Voice-actors have been cast well, there is a lot of great voice-acting in the game and it helps to suspend disbelief, helping immersion and reinforcing our empathy towards the characters.Highly recommended to anyone that loves stealth, a great story, or just wants to try something new. The hours I've played it on PC are not representative of my total hours (PC and PS2). Worth it just for the soundtrack!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the classics games of the 2000s. Implements portions of stealth, platforming, action, and racing. It also includes a nifty element of taking pictures of different species of wild life to earn money. You(Jade) will have help of a companion for the most of game to help you in situations from puzzle solving, and fighting. Has a really interesting plot that involves around a conspiracy! You(Jade) suspect that the local military is working with an invading alien race the DomZ of kidnapping the local Hillyis population, and you need proof to unravel this conspiracy and get the doubting remaining population of Hilliyis to believe you and put a stop to it.

												Amazing game but I can't recommend it because ubisoft didn't bother to patch the game and just slapped whatever version they had on steam for some easy money.It aged teribly and it's hard to get the game run properly in 2016 on windows 10. I've been trying to fix it for the last couple days but nothing seems to work. I eather get terible framerate(1-10fps constantly) or terible graphical artifacts that make the game unplayable. Don't buy it unless you have an old rig.It's a god damn shame that amazing games like this one have such terible publishers that don't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about anything but how to make money for the least effort.UPDATE: 1 week and 3 operating systems later I made it work. I wanted to play this game so bad I got my old HDD, installed windows xp on it but had issues with sound. Finally it works properly on windows 7. So now everytime I want to play this game I have to reboot my pc go into BIOS to switch HDD priority and run the windows 7 one... For such an epic game I honestly don't mind but cmon... It's 2016 (almost 2017) and this game is on steam...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands down one of the best Action-Adventure game ive played to this date, I loved the charecters and story and this review will tell you why I personally enjoyed each aspect of the game. (Ubisoft release BGaE 2 Please!) Before you question that I don't have the hours played on this game I have played the ps2 version and the HD remastered verson on the Xbox 360 and completed it on each platform. What does the game offer in terms of what genre it is The game is an Action/Adventure game with elements of Stealth and puzzle solving. The game doesnt throw you into battles all the time and most battles you can avoid by running away. The stealth in this game is almost completely optional unless theres a drone in the room, this drone only targets intruders when spotted and will instantly kill you which enforces you to be stealthy. There are puzzles to solve and most of them are easy to do like for example you have to redirect light beams to go to a certain area to access the next area. StoryWarning: This story is not set on the planet Earth, its a factional planet called HillysWhen i first started playing I didn't know what to expect when i first played but the story grabbed me about how the population was threatened by aliens called the Domz and how they attack every so often. When you first get to play you are thrown into combat stright away and the game doesn't hold your hand when it comes to showing combat, it shows a small text at the bottom showing what you press to attack but thats it, the enemy won't wait. As you play through the game you realise that the so called protectors are your enemy and the rebel organisation is actually the good guys. There is 3 dungon like places you go into to sneak around gathering infomation about what they are actually doing and exposeing them for what they do. I could go into more detail about the story but I don't want to spoil the story MusicEDIT: I almost forgot about the music, ill tag it hereThe music in the game is one of the best composed soundtrack. Each track suits the time it is played, an example when the main character gets depressed and the soundtrack suits it as they use viloin as well as low notes to express the feelings. There are other times but its worth to play a demo of this game or to play the game to get the full feeling for the game. CharectersThere is One main character that you control called Jade, she is the reporter and also an animal documenter (as thats a main way of obtaining units which is the currency of the game) and she looks after the orphans of Hillys and she has to leave them to do her missions which sets up the plot of the game. She has two companions throughout the game.The first one, Pey'j is her uncle who helps looking after the orphans and is also a mechanic. He doesnt stay for long as he is captured at the factory when you are finding out about what the alpha sections are doing. Pey'j has a special ability which allows him to slam onto the ground which throws up enemys to allow you to attack them and use them as projectiles. After the main plot is developed Pey'j gets a field ability where he can cut through metal fences which allows you to access areas or to get further through the main story.When you save Double H at the factory he joins you as the other companion throughout the rest of the game and he helps you through the remainder of the game.  Double H has a specal abilty where he uses his hammer to throw up enemys just like Pey'j but he has a field abilty where he will charge head first (helmet equipped of course) to knock down metal barred doors. What was the final boss likeObviously with a title like this i shouldn't need to tell you that there will be spoliers but i'll put it here anyway.SPOLIER ALERTSPOLIER ALERTI have warned you. Don't complain if I spoil too much. The final boss was unique as it had you thinking on your feet as you attack, he steals your uncle which leaves you with yourself and Double H, after killing the clones of your uncle Double H is taken as well and you have to fight the clones of Double H by your self and the clones keep telling you that you should give up, which isn't a option. Adventually you will be weakened as the boss says and will reverse your directional controls regardless of your settings, you can not go into the settings and change them because the game will keep them reversed, im not sure if you can go into the game with reversed directional controls and for it to be flipped. This is unique as i havent seen any other final boss do this. If your a controller user (from the ps2 or xbox 360/PS3 games) you could flip the controller itself making it slightly easier. I will not spoil how the game ends, ill leave that to you Was there anything i didn't like?There wasn't much I didn't like. I loved each part of the game. I guess that the most difficult parts would be when you had a drone in the room forceing stealth as it was in a difficult room where the guards are placed in difficult spots to get pass, for example placed at the doorway you need to get out at.Do I recommend this gameDefently as it will give you hours of fun as the main game lasts for about 7 to 8 hours without getting all the collectables, if your a completionist then it would take about 11 to 14 hours tops to get everything.

												I don't think I'll ever find a game that is better than Beyond Good and Evil.I have finished it about 6 times over 10 years, I have explored every corner of it and I can't find words to tell how much I love it.Some people say that it's not that great, because it's old or because it has simple/ripped-off mechanics, but those people don't understand what is this game about.It's more than just another adventure/stealth game. It's a gateway to a beautiful, living, unique world.There are many games with better graphics or mechanics, but this game has a soul and there are very few games in the world that have that.I recommend buying this game right now.Ignore those few negative reviews, don't watch the trailer, don't read the description, don't look at screenshots, just get it and play.There's a huge chance that you will fall in love with this game forever.And it's a chance worth taking.PS.:

Story:Year 2435 on the planet Hillys.After an attack by the Domz, Jade - the protagonist - got involved into an underground network which wants to find out the truth about the alien invaders.It's up to you now to investigate the connection between the attacking Domz and the defending army called 'Alpha Section'.As I don't want to spoil any content:Touching story! I'm sure you will enjoy it.Gameplay:While running, driving, sneaking and even flying a space ship, you have to take pictures of creatures or your targets of evidence and fighting the enemies who will show you that visitors are not welcome.my opinion:The mixed game style of sneaking and taking pictures as evidence on the one hand and fighting against the Domz on the other is not for everyone but after ten years this is stil one of the best stories in a video game I've ever played. It is just amazing!It's really a shame that this game did never recieve the attention it deserves.Definetly worth every cent - not to mention that it's on 75% sale quiet often.other words I wanna share:The default keyboard settings are kinda mixed up. - 'E': Jump  - 'Space': CameraIt kinda reminds me of The elder Scrolls III Morrowind - It had the exact same weird switched bindings (Space was 'use' there).Just Switch the two buttons and enjoy :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Carlson and Peters! Chapter 84 , Buy this game.I was a little kid when I first saw this game. And just yesterday I have finished it and enjoyed it well. Beyond Good and Evil is an awesome action - adventure game with has brought innovations to gaming industry. Weird but original characters , good story and our main character 'Jade' will make you have good and enjoyable moments while you try to fight alien race called DomZ and reveal secrets to your people.Last but not least, this game has incredibly good soundtracks that are catchy and creative. This is a milestone from golden times of Ubisoft. I don't think it's a bad port, a HD edition would be awesome though but , a-must-play game that is.10/10 would Chiliconcarne again.

 Gameplay Beyond good and evil is a openworld rpg.The combat is quite simple you have 1 attack button ( and upgrades later on ) and a dodge button.Overtime you get upgrades like gloves that shoot things.And heres comes my favorite bit the camera you take pictures of creatures/npcs to gain money and pearls.Pearls are used for upgrades for your vehicles you gain em by doing races, exploring, making enough photos, and lastly bosses.You have activities like racing just cave with creatures and pearls etc.You travel through the world with your boat and aircraft(which you get pretty late)The ship controls are pretty good and the combat is also solid, But then theres the aircraft controls which arent as good i suggest you just hold space while using the mouse.You have followers if they die game over, oh and they do special attacks.And as last you have stealth guard have 3 modes : the they havent seen you yet mode( green), The they heard you or saw you a lil bit (pink?), and the theyve seen you hide or kill em now( red).Most stealth rooms i just killed the guards they all mostly have a weak spot at theyre backs, but some rooms you have to stealth or youll get instakilled.The bosses are pretty easy once you find out what to hit or with what to hit the bosses.The last boss however can stunlock you and it inverts your controls,  i just gave up on the boss because i couldnt do it. Story I really dont want to spoil anything but ill just tell about some of the characters.You play as jade and you have peyj as your companion. i really cared abut the characters.Then you have the alpha somethings theyre here to save the hillyans and then there are the domz which are the evil aliens.The story is really well paced and you really have some feels moments in it. Audio and graphics The soundtrack is amazing it does the creepy music right the intense music/action music really gives you a boost.The graphics havent aged that well but the creature designs are great, the npcs are either just normal humans or just humans crossed with animals,The other creatures looks also quite reminiscent of various animals.The town looks futuristic.Oh and if you have the flickery graphics bug go to yer setting launcher and turn off hw something processing.The camera sometimes has siezures but its ok somtimes ihad to fight with the damn thing. Final verdict Amzazing soundtrack story which you care about the characters, pretty basic combat,stealth which mostly just works but you can combat out of most rooms.Dated but good artstyle/npc’s.But a bad last boss.And a refreshing camera mechanic.No drama, Just Reviews.

Short version: 92%Beyond Good & Evil mixes many gameplay elements to create a fun, adventurous, yet surprisingly serious storyline about the struggles of a reporter who slowly uncovers the sinister plot against her home planet. Although it gained some recognition in the past five years, this game is still one of the most underappreciated sparkling gems of this century.Long version:Beyond Good & Evil was praised by both the press and players alike, yet it is still a perpetual resident on any list that collects the best rarely known games from the past 10-15 years or so. At first glance, these ratings are difficult to justify – after all, the game is a strange hodgepodge of various genres: puzzle, platformer, stealth, 3D brawler, treasure hunt, with some driving and racing on top.While these mixed-genre games rarely work, somehow the designers managed to keep all of these elements together in a tight knot. After getting used to the controls (a controller helps), we find a game with great mechanics, astonishing levels of large variety, and a small world that constantly offers some activity between the platforming stages, but not in a distracting manner.The final selling point is the story: we follow the adventures of Jade, a reporter and caretaker of some recently orphaned children. She gradually gets entangled in the war between her home planet and the invading aliens, only to discover the sinister truth behind the attacks, the recent kidnappings, and her own past.Despite the serious nature of the story, both the aesthetics and the writing tries to be light-hearted and fun, giving a great sense of adventure even when you are discussing battle plans in the back room of a bar. The cast does a wonderful job of delivering some memorable lines, elevating Beyond Good & Evil into a classic status, recommended for anyone who never had the pleasure of playing it.

												This was one of my favorite games on the X-box (if not my favorite), and is currently still my top 3 of best games all time. It's just one of those golden oldies where the story, the feel and the gameplay are more important than having the latest shiney graphics (but boring repetative gameplay and zero depth). I bought this to relive the adventure (and to kill time waiting for part 2 ;)), and for the current price on sale I can only recommend everyone to do the same.You take on the role of reporter Jade and her trusted pig buddy Pey'J, who must fight to uncover a conspiracy of global proportions taking place on their homeplanet Hyllis. The game sports RPG-like elements, since Jade has equipement that can be upgraded by collecting a special currency, blue pearls, which are collected by defeating enemies and minigames. Although the storyline is linear, (parts of) the world can be roamed freely in between missions, giving a great sense of freedom. Most of the characters you encounter while roaming are likeable and often funny. All-in-all the game is strong all-round, offering excelling storytelling and gameplay, and fitting graphics and music.Why buy it?Loveable protagonistsFantastic atmosphereGreat storytellingDiverse gameplay - fast combat with fun puzzles and minigamesWonderful music and sound effectsPersonally, I also really enjoy the cartoony, colourful graphics styleWhy not?It is a port from the X-box (classic), and a somewhat poor one: some people are having problems setting the game up properly, and are having some difficulties with the controlsIt's (13 years!) old, so you might find the graphics a bit outdated ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game. Strong female lead, love the stealth and photography mechanics, great story, wonderful characters. BEWARE THE PARTNER GLITCH. At certain points in the game, your tag along pal might glitch out. Rotate your saves, and DO NOT SAVE WHILE YOU ARE ALONE, because you can't get the tag along back, and you need them for progression. If at any point when you have a partner you notice them missing, reload a previous save. Other than that one minor problem, Beyond Good and Evil is an amazing game, and I'm very sad a sequel will probably never happen. ;_;			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I nominate this game for ""Best use of a farm animal Award"", back when Ubisoft was making top quality games like this one. It's charming, atmospheric and it's one of the first games to introduce a strong female protagonist. My biggest complain would be the camera angles that can be frustrating at times but if you can get through that it's an enjoyable game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games I've ever played! The story is amazing, the characters are heartwarming, funny and it's just so much fun to get through the game. Just let me say, it actually never gets boring to play that game. And it's impossible to NOT like the characters! If you are interested in good stories, neat graphics (yeah, this game is pretty old, but the graphics are also a + for the game okay!) and funny quotes as well as some good old fighting moments, then you'll have a lot of fun with that game. I also like the environment and the slighty futuristic touch in the game! :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, I love this game. Beyond Good & Evil is great.But DO NOT buy this game for the pc. It is an insult that Ubisoft/Steam would release and sell this.As it stands it does not appear to support widescreen, controllers, and it is a bit on the finiky side with new technology.There may be some fixes out there for it, but it is still unacceptable to release a game in this state.Hopefully Steam will release an update or a fixed version in the future, but as of now in its current condition I would avoid.

												Excellent third person action game. It's been a long while since I've seen this game, but even though I was ""late"" to the party, so to speak, as I didn't play it anywhere close to initial release, the game held up brilliantly. Aside from a few mandatory stealth sections which were more annoying than fun, it was solid start-to-finish, and I cannot recommend this game enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I first played this on console and the PC version holds very true in all respects to the original. However, important Con/negative first as it's a biggie.Con: You can NOT fully complete the game because an in-game treat/easter egg/bonus requires you using a code on a website page that no longer exists. This cannot even be obtained via online guides or cheating (unless you get a save file from someone with the proper code if they exist - I've not checked.)Pro's:Open world that expands as you get further in the game (ability to hop over force field/energy fences, spaceship, etc.)Unique plot that's actually rather fun.Gain credits/money via your skill in taking photos (which also gives you pearls, which are used in the black market for items you need.) This can take some time to get right and multiple animals in a shot is truly helpful and gives bonuses. Keep that in mind.There's really a fair bit of enjoyment in the game as long as you're okay with not being able to fully finish it (a pain for me) as mentioned.Overall: 10/10 (considering its age, I can't hold the lack of webpage being down for the 100% option being gone.)-Paladeus			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Are you ready to transcend morality and petty social convention?Though disappointed initially by the lack of Nietzsche, Beyond Good & Evil delivers a good action-adventure game that delves into some surprisingly dark themes and mature content. The beautiful visuals really have helped with how finely the game has aged over the years, with lighting in particular creating some stunning vistas and stellar views of the various landscapes and colourful underground. A gritty approach to science fiction, BGE follows the young photojournalist Jade, a caretaker of sorts for a bunch of ragtag kids and orphans on the planet of Hyllis, along with her long-time friend and mentor Pey’J. Futuristic but with noticeable fantasy and steampunk influences, the on-going war between the supposedly benevolent Alpha Sections regime and the “DomZ” – a seemingly endless alien force – in the backdrop to an otherwise peaceful, everyday setting gradually begins to appear as more than it seems. Pulled into a momentous conspiracy cover-up, you’re tasked to reveal the truth and ignite a revolution.Gameplay is broken down into a mixture of free-roaming, puzzles and stealth sections. There’s a decent enough amount of content for you to try outside of missions, but most of it generally comes down to forgettable mini-games and pearl hunting. The stealth system is very simplistic but works well for what it sets out to do, even if you’ll find yourself asking how on earth you managed to sneak past that guard without being detected.In terms of puzzles, they’re generally straightforward to do and rely on grasping the layout of the level’s environment, though may appear bewildering in design at times. Any more than this I can’t really comment on, considering my own legendary impatience and lack of skill in solving video game puzzles. Be ready to add a bit more on to the average completion time if you’re in a similar position. The art style is great, with a nice vibrancy and cartoonish aesthetic to it, and character models equally so. The sound design is fantastic, with the score in particular really creating a moody, sci-fi ambiance. Some of it’s almost reminiscent of Kelly Bailey’s work for Half-Life and suits the game perfectly. However, BGE does suffer from the typical trappings of the genre’s design. The fixed camera positions can be a nightmare at times, especially in vehicle sections, and this has a rather significant effect on not only basic navigation but the otherwise smooth and relatively satisfying gameplay. Jade has some great moves in combat, (think of a more dexterous equivalent to Monkey’s style in Enslaved: Odyssey to the West), but the camera and constantly changing direction of movement controls can be immensely frustrating to wrestle with. Also, facial animations and lip-syncing doesn’t occur for in-game/contextual dialogue… another odd drawback. Some other more minor issues generally come down to noticeable clipping and some A.I. quirks but overall the technical aspects are quite good.The biggest failing of Beyond Good & Evil is in the constant grind that is required to progress throughout the main story. Being an older adventure game and thus featuring the obligatory unlock currency system, BGE requires you to upgrade the central hovercraft vehicle with the collectible pearls that are scattered throughout the map and various levels. While most of these you’ll come by incidentally, completing tasks or through purchases, you will eventually be required to painfully grind to receive the next unlock, most likely at the end of the game, where this shouldn’t be happening at the most. (♥♥♥♥ing hell, that final boss fight was brutal.)While I can understand this age-old trope of game design, it really detracts from an otherwise enjoyable game when the story itself is locked off to you. There is no cheat code or other way to bypass these mind-numbing sections outside of a custom editor, so the grind is unfortunately inevitable. You might argue that this was done to encourage exploration, but the game was already worth delving into and shouldn't have to be forced upon players either. The best way to avoid it would be to just carefully scour the levels early on and try and complete miscellaneous tasks wherever possible. In all honesty, I don’t usually go for these kinds of games but found Beyond Good & Evil to be really enjoyable. If you’re a fan of the likes of Tomb Raider, Zelda, Shadow of the Colossus or Devil May Cry, you’ll be right at home here with a good experience all-round on offer, totalling around 10 or so hours of play. You can also remind yourself of what Ubisoft used to be.It may be in development hell, but whenever the second game comes, it’ll be worth it. Thumbs up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story first, i got this game around 2003-04 when i was just a simple kid with no english language skills. Only things i understood about this game was:#1. Hit evil aliens in the face#2. Pig man is your friend.#3. Take photos of animals and things#4. Go around in a hovercraft.. somewhere.Back then, i only visited the Hillys City and never went forward from there. I played it maybe a couple of days, then, i forgot the game for a long time. At times i heard and saw something about the game, the upcoming sequal etc. But never i decided to playthrough it, even though i was always intrigued about it.UNTIL NOW. I saw Beyond Good & Evil in steam sale under 2 euros. There, in that moment,i decided finally to play it through. Better late than never, right?And oh man yes, i did the right choice.The interesting semi-open world, diverse characters which you actually start to care about. Unique art style, awesome soundtrack as well great sound desing overall.Fun engaging and unique gameplay mechanics and the gripping, touching, even shocking story makes this game truly a masterpiece.PS: To make Beyond Good & Evil work in modern PC's properly, remember to DISABLE these settings in the Advanced Settings tab in the games launcher/SettingsApplication.exe:- HW Vertex Processing- Multi vertex stream- Autogen mipmapThis is how you get rid of the annoying flickering stuff.I also recommend this Widescreen Fix: http://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/22-beyond-good-evil-widescreen-fix/Like it says, ""Extract the files to the same folder as BGE.exe and edit the included .ini file to achieve your desired resolution. Don't forget to set the game's resolution to the same values as you did in the .ini, failing to do so will result in resolution glitches in most cases.""For more help, visit http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Beyond_Good_%26_Evil ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Please note that the thumbs down is for the PC port presented on steam and not the actual game (which plays spendidly on consoles). Actually, THIS IS AS POOR AS PC PORTS COME! - Glitchy graphics- Framerate issues- Sound and sync issues- Compatibility problems- Zero controller supportYou name'm, this stinky mother of a port has them all. I definitely recommend you play the game on one of the original consoles or just wait for the inevitable HD remake. I would stay say away from this bad PC port. period.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though the game's story never gets quite as interesting as the title would suggest and the camera is very much from the early 2000s, on the whole, Beyond Good and Evil is one darn good game that you could probably squeeze between 8-12 hours out of. I'd especially reccommend it to Zelda fans who want to try something new yet familiar (or don't want to shell out for a console).And though it's always better to buy things on sale if you can, if you're really interested, I don't think anyone who pays $9.99 for this will be too terribly disappointed.

												 Simply one of the best video games ever made. Unfortunately it was made by a company that has no respect for PC gaming and actively views pc gamers as nothing but whitney pirates not worth their trouble. So they released this broken port as a cash grab. The work-arounds to get this one up and functioning are long and a bit arduous, but doable (see the guide I compiled for how I got it functioning). Again this is another example of Ubisoft expressing their disdain of our hobby. Its just too bad that such a beautiful game had to be caught in the middle.All in all I cannot recommend an incredible game that you have to rely on the goodwill of unpaid enthusiasts to make playable. Again this is ubisoft giving us a non-functioning product for full price when you would be better off just getting a cracked version from day one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beyond Good and Evil stands alongside Okami and Darksiders as the very best Legend of Zelda-likes. Bolstering lovable characters, an interesting story, a believable world immersed in conflict, and an interesting array of dungeons and world building, BG&E is a very fun action adventure title that's well worth its price. It's not a perfect game, nor is it ""incredible"", but it's in no way just average. Some minor quips are that the controls and camera can act pretty awful, and it sometimes becomes pretty easy to get lost.Personally, I feel that the game is at its strongest in the first of its four dungeons, as it is most evocative of Zelda during this time. Following the first dungeon, the game begins to stress its stealth elements, something rarely seen in Zelda, but not unwelcomed in BG&E. I feel that the game's dungeons tend to take a small dive, but it recovers for the end and wraps up in a satisfying conclusion. (That is, unless you watch after the credits)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Side quests are intresting from photograthing EVERY living thing on the planet to racing your hovercraft it ends up being easy to loose track of the main story line. Combat can be a little dull at times as it all comes down to paterns and timing to defeat some bosses.

-Quick Review-Beyond Good and Evil is Ubisoft's under-rated-masterpiece, it was first released on the PlayStation 2 on November 11, 2003. The beautiful Music was Composed by Christophe Héral.Beyond Good and Evil is by far the most beautiful, outstanding game I ever played on the PS2, and when I saw it was available on Steam I exploded. There are many games that we as gamers 'play and forget'. Beyond Good and Evil is one of the games I will never forget.-Video Review!-


YouTube™ Video: Atratzu Reviews: Beyond Good and Evil - Ain't Morality something? 

			Views: 465		

			Atratzu Reviews Beyond Good and Evil, for the Playstation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Steam PC port. This is one of the RPG's he speaks most highly of, so it's befitting this is the first game he reviews!		

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Beyond Good and Evil's Protagonist is a bright young woman named Jade. Jade is an avid martial artist, photographer and investigative reporter. She has been staying with her 'Uncle' Pay'j (A pig/boar-like biped, whom is acting as Jade's Guardian) to help take care of orphans at their lighthouse home.Jade and Pay'j are on the mining planet “Hillys”. Hillys is under siege by an extraterrestrial group known as the “DomZ”, the DomZ are skeleton-reaper-like-aliens whom abduct and drain the life from their victims. Recently a group known as “The Alpha Sections” have taken up residence on Hillys. The Alpha Sections have sworn to defend the population of Hillys from these devastating DomZ attacks.


Just an awesome moment in the begining of the game. 
A Screenshot of Beyond Good & Evil
By: Atratzu




Gameplay: You play the game as Jade, in a third person camera view, the game is broken down into two modes: combat mode and stealth mode. (Side note: There is much more to the game than that, sometimes you need to take pictures, solve puzzles, figure out riddles, play mini games, and have dialogue with other NPC's.)When in combat, Jade wields a special Bo Staff known as a “Jō”; Jade preforms strikes, flips, and power attacks while in combat mode. If you were unsuccessful in sneaking past enemies you can fight your way through many parts of the game. However there is definitely an emphasis on stealth rather than fighting.When in stealth, Jade sneaks and rolls, there are oftentimes alternative paths to sneak around guards, other times you need to distract guards by creating a diversion to take them away from their posts, while you sneak past.

A final note I should make, is the console to PC port wasn't quite perfect; the camera angle is sometimes a little bit awkward, but you eventually get used to the limitations and controls; Beyond Good and Evil is still very playable.Achievements: There are no achievements in the game, however there are extra things to collect while playing. You can take pictures of all the animals in the game, and collect all the pearls, and find every M-disks. Price: Beyond Good and Evil is priced at $9.99, my first play through I unlocked everything before beating the game (I took my sweet time about it, and it took about 9-11 hours) the game can easily take anywhere from 6-8 hours to complete.When I was younger playing this game on the PS2; I remember that I almost beat this whole game in a day. My parrents left the house in the late morning and I started playing Beyond Good and Evil, when they got back that evening I was still playing. Needless to say, they were not pleased with my binge-playing-habits.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511832156Conclusion: Seriously, just buy and play this game.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update August 29, 2015:Spelling fix, by Angfucious.

												Absolute joy of a 3rd person adventure title. On par with your Jax daxter and your sly cooper series. Beyond Good and Evil does some interesting things you don't normally see in games of this genre. That said the game is poorly optimized. Be warned you will have to toggle a number of features off to get the game to run properly. Once thats done you can relax and enjoy the 10 -12 hr campaign.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before I get too far into this I'll start by saying that Beyond Good And Evil is in no way the best game ever made, as some would have you believe. I've clocked this game a bunch of times on various systems, Ive bought it no less then 4 times (PS2, PS3, Windows and Steam)... that alone should tell you how much I like this platformer.The controls could be improved and the battle is in no way the best but if you can overlook that and want a beautifully atmospheric world to explore then pick it up. I think it's well worth the purchase (especially at $10 or your regional equivalent).Cool funky music, a nice water world to traverse in your hover craft, quirky characters to interact with and nicely designed enemies to fight with. Even a nice little horor/anti-establishment feel to story. Jade (our hero) is one of my favourite female leeds. Looks cool, well voice acted, strong kickarse attitude who is half melee brawler and half super sleuth trying to get to the bottom of this epic mystery.I have been eagerly awaiting Beyond Good And Evil 2 since 2008... as have a dedicated fan base... if it ever comes out I will snap it up in a heart beat (after looking at reviews to make sure they didn't just poop out a half arsed sequel for the sake of making money) but in the mean time, I'll happily fire this up again.

												This is one of the great games from my later childhood, one I would play for hours and hours, even though I didn't understand the plot, the game and its mechanics where just so enjoyable, and there are some rather interesting side activities in this old open worlds game. I hope to replay it at some point so I can fully understand its deep narrative and story, but for now I can fully recommend you this game merely on the basis of its great mechanics and the gameplay enjoyable, without even remembering how the plot that I didn't really get were!So please, buy this game, for your own good.

												Steam says 0 hours but I promise I've played it on Steam and obviously on PS2 back when it was out.What an amazing game. A completely underrated classic. Originally released in 2003 and it's still as fun today as it was then. I cannot recommend this game enough and at £6.99 you are absolutely missing out if you don't buy this. A beautifully written story with loveable characters and plenty of puzzle/stealth. Difficult to get working on windows so be prepared to go googling for work-arounds and fixes, literally my only complaint.Eagerly awaiting the sequel, stop making Assassins Creed games and give us what we want.

												Yes, it's not an overly brutal and serious game. Yes, the graphics are rather dated. But damn, this story. These characters. This soundtrack.The story is engaging and there are some nice plot twists to keep you on your toes. The characters are likable and each has their own personality. Especially Jade. Can we have more protagonists like her, please? She's a reporter armed with a camera and a staff. Not yet another one of those bloodthirsty, psychopathic assassins, and this is a really refreshing change.There could have been more explanation for why things are, as the answer to that quite often seems to be ""just because"". Also, be warned, quite often you'll not only have to fight monsters, but also the camera - it's annoying.Overall though, it's a pleasant game, and I enjoyed every moment of it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game in my youth and I have many fond memories of the game. The art style, animation style, and soundtrack all give this game a unique and emersive feel. It is a stealth game at its core but has some great action sequences and lends itself well to a cinematic feel. It is easier now than I remember it being and the story isn't very long either. The graphics have aged reasonably well and the gameplay and story are still quite enjoyable. I would recomend this game to most if not all of my friends especially if its on sale. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The truth is the controls are a bit weird and the textures can get a bit funky sometimes, but even with all that I still thoroughly enjoyed playing this game AGAIN (and expect to play it many more times). The characters are lovable, I love how the world looks, I love collecting pearls and taking pictures of wildlife and I truly love the gameplay and the story.I highly reccomend this game to anyone who hasn't played it yet.

												A fantastic game if I do say so myself! There’s a reason this game is in the top ten of games that deserve a sequel. This game is not dated at all even if the graphics are a bit wonky at times. Plus the camera can be a bit annoying but after playing games like tomb raider, its nothing. The game has a great story, vibrant characters, a beautiful world, and a great mix of stealth, combat, plat forming and puzzles. Plus there is all the additions that come from Latin, Jamaican and Japanese cultures added within. Put in there a beautiful soundtrack and you have the making of an impressive game. Plus it has probably one of the best female protagonist I've ever seen. The game has so much to offer and I wish it was longer. Sadly a sequel isn't in sight right now but who knows. I'm sure one day Ubisoft will pick this gem up and give it a much deserved sequel. At 2 dollars, this game is worth every penny! You should really play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beyond Good & Evil is a fine game. The story is good, the gameplay is great. It's a free-roam adventure, where you explore a small world and persue the story at your own pace. This game is unpretentiously fun.Your character is a reporter investigating a grand conspiracy theme. Gameplay centers around Infiltrating government and industrial sites to capture clues and unravel the mystery. There are stealth elements, too, and occasional combat. And a sort of internal achievement system that rewards you for capturing photographs along the way of rare fauna. BG&E has the best sidekick characters since Grim Fandango, and a similar smart sense of humor. It's a console port, but the controls are decent, despite this. I finished the game with mouse and keyboard with no difficulty. The graphics are PS2-era, but they have a distinct style of their own. Jade reminds me more than a little of HL2's Alyx.I understand that there is a ""Beyond Good & Evil 2"" coming soon; catch up on the storyline first.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 After 10 hours of gameplay i can safely say that this is one of the best games ever made. The sound and story are awesome but the graphics have aged (pretty well on my opinion). The problem is just that this steam version is really hard to boot up, i had to check some fixes on the internet and therefore i dont have any gameplay time on my steam account because youre forced to play through the file directory. I rate this game a 9/10 but beware if you dont manage yourself well with game directories youd rather buy a gamecube or an xbox and play BG&E in there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's hard to say for me if the biggest pro is the soundtrack or the story and the characters, but they are both damn good. Sure it's old (released in 2003), but for me thanks to this it easily grabs my nostalgia, since I played it a lot back then.Well, there are some issues, controls can really annoy sometimes, it might be hard to make the game run smoothly, and so on...With this many reviews it's kind of hard to add anything new, besides few minor things: indeed, there is a special currency which is required to go on with the story, but I wouldn't say it's a problem to collect the right amount since most of them are found on your standard way through the game, and it might not be necessary to engage yourself with the arcade part of the game if you don't want to. Second thing: it's not *that* long, but it is a game that I really like to come back to every once in a while. It's interesting that (at least for me) the graphics didn't age that much. Of course, you can see the diffrence between BG&E and latest games, but the thing is that graphics don't take away your attention from the story. As for troubleshooting the graphics, there are solutions on the internet how to change game's settings so that it runs on newer machines (solutions for Win7 work also for Win10).And the sequel... Originally (from what I know) it was meant as a trilogy, but it wasn't much of a success so second part is still in the production, and nobody knows when will they release it. But we're waiting.tl;dr: yes, it's worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're tired of quasi-historical figures stabing their way through the past and being all emo about it, then give this game a look. A good mix of stealth, puzzle solving, and (an this is my own personal kryptonite) racing. Has it aged well, compared to some current games? Not perfectly, but it's still a very serviceable game, a lot of fun to play, and Jade is a likeable, relatable female lead. The only issue is the camera in some scenes, and the controls to have a bit of a learning curve, especially in race segments.But aside from those nitpicks, and a depressing lack of a sequel, Beyond Good & Evil is a game I would recommend to anyone!

												Планета Хиллис, почти Венеция.Мир этой игры один из немногих в которых я бы хотела жить (еще два мира из Dreamfall Chapters).В этой игре хорошо все.В основу сюжета игры положена идея Ницше из его работы По ту сторону добра и зла.Очень глубокая мысль для игры. Авторы смогли хорошо ее обыграть.Харизматичные персонажи. Их достаточно много и разнообразная анимация (и без движения за ними интересно наблюдать).Есть дополнительные миссия, которые увеличивают время игры и придают ей разнообразие - один поиск и съемка животных чего стоит)Удобное управление. Угол вида иногда меняется, но это раздражает в очень редких случаях, когда не ожидаешь и не успеваешь перестроиться.Приятное музыкальное сопровождение.Игра моего детства, которая и сейчас не теряет актуальности и не надоедает :)Не знаю будет ли продолжение и что там у них получиться - я не хочу об этом думать.Хочется написать отдельную благодарность за перевод Буки: с душой подошли с таком делу :) (Здесь, к сожалению его нет - я его еще помню))			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never played the original and this is my first experience with this game. I did have a bunch of graphical problems, and controller issues (I have an old random pc controller so I had to use Xpadder)A fun and neat game, I usually don't play stealth games so this was interesting! Story was interesting, I like how the (human) character designs and art style kind of clashed with the propaganda/human experimentation thing the game's story offered. The only negative point was the ship, I hated the Slaughterhouse level because of the ship controls.At the start I did try to collect everything but the Slaughterhouse really bummed me out so after that I just wanted to complete the game. I'm probably being too negative because of that but I just really don't like driving mechanics and boy that ship was bad, anyways.Combat was meh, nothing fancy, the stealth was where it was at.There isn't much replay value to this game so I dont really see myself playing it again, but if they ever made the sequel they SAID they were going to I'd definitely check it out!

												It's a shame that this amazing game was never properly recognized. If you're a fan of action adventure games, look no further because this is the best you can get, even in comparison with today's titles. I won't summarize the story, but let me just write that the main character is an independent young woman named Jade who happens to be a reporter on a planet that is currently in the middle of a war. Although your main task is to uncover the cospiracy that involves your planet's government, there are also side quests you can work on, the best being photographing all the species you encounter. The atmosphere and story are excellent, and some characters you simply have to love (Pey'j). The game balances stealth and action well and once you get used to the controls, it's pretty intuitive. For 5 euro, it's a must have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of the best-designed games ever, and possesses a certain spirit lacking in conventional modern titles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an older game now, but still a good one.  It has some stealth and combat, but the chase scenes are the best part.  A good story and voice acting and not uber violent.  Lots of fans are looking forward to a sequel, but it hasn't seen the light of day yet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a beautifully designed game that holds up well to the test of time. You get treated with some cool gameplay mechanics and the game manages to be somewhere between stealth action and exploring. its a really nice mix with some great characters and a good story. If you don't mind the dated graphics its damn fun. I just recommend you to emulate a controller via XPadder because its nearly unplayable with keyboard and mouse in my opinion! and the boss design in some part is a bit strange.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's funny how this game is nearly 15 years old now, but feels more relevant than ever. Beyond Good & Evil is basically a game about journalism, and how important a role it plays in society. Playing it in 2017, it was almost eerie to see how relevant it felt to current events. That theme and the way its presented throughout the story feels like unique territory for gaming, making this a really special game. On that merit alone, I'd recommend this to anyone who's interested in seeing how a big studio game can effectively tackle real world issues like any other art form.Though, it's important to know what you're getting into. This game is from 2003, and it really shows. While playing it, I couldn't stop noticing all of the outdated trends of the era used here. There's obligatory stealth, arbitrary, collecting, generic Zelda-esque action, and goofy PS2-platformer humor that doesn't quite mesh with the game's tone (it feels like someone shoved Ratchet & Clank's jokes into a completely different game). None of it is purely bad, but it certainly doesn't age well making certain sections of it a slog. It's also a very buggy game (again, as you may expect). In one of the biggest cutscenes in the game, the dialogue track completely cut out for me, so I missed a pretty major section.If all of that sounds like it'd drive you crazy, then I wouldn't recommend it. But I still maintain that there's enough value in this to warrant checking it out. I think it's one of the more effective studio games I've played in terms of how meaningful it feels. This should be at the center of a video game museum, showcasing how the medium of games can do more than simply entertain us.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like the old games because they're awesome. You can feel the passion to create games from the creators when you are playing this game. Also the old games have another essence that make you appreciate them and never forget them. This game contains a lot of mechanics; racing, adventure, fighting, exploring, camera mechanics,  puzzles and collections.  Also It takes away the bad taste from playing Tales of zestiria (lol). The only inconvenient for me, It´s the camera in the rooms where you need to sneak from enemies and when you fail, you must fight them but the angle camera change a lot and obstruct you in the fight.

												3:00 am, just beat this game in two days, sadly. This game is incredible. The art style is beautiful and the soundtrack immerses you into the game so well. This is a game that gets hard to put away. If you don't care about graphics (this game is from 2003) and you want an immersive storyline with characters that are impossible to not love, then play this game. Maybe its just the nostalgia coming in, but I love this game so much its unbelievable. One of my favourite games ever, probably my favourite PS2 game. The only problem I had was the PC version is slightly glitchy, you need to change a few thigns in advanced options to get it running smoothly. It kinda makes peoples mouth move funny but its not a big deal. It didn't seem overly optimized for PC, sometimes the camera left a little to be desired but for the most part it was decent.The only thing I would say is I hate the ending. But I hate it because BGE 2 is not a thing yet and the ending feels more like a beginning than an end. I have never wanted a sequel more than this, I was excited when I heard about Fallout 4, but if BGE 2 ever comes out I might need 4 new changes of pantsAlso, don't watch all of the credits unless you want to stab yourself in the face 6000 times a day waiting for the sequelHOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥UBI, WHERE'S TEH FAKING GAME its like they don't understand, this wouldn't be GOTY, it would be GOTC (century) it would be the greatest game of all time, why cant they just make it already holyshitholyshitholyshitholyshit im dying D:.

												Still, way to few people talk about this game. Speculations about the sequel change frequently and make it all the harder to play this game time and time again. Not because it isn't fun, but because you want more - you don't want this to be all.BG&E is a game which I could pick up and play to 100% completion any second - and I would enjoy myself. I played it first on my gamecube and when it released on Steam it was an instabuy and an instaplay. Start to finish. And there was hardly any minute, nay second in which I didn't like what the game had to offer. Before I get to the game itself, just a little insight into my perspective towards a special kind of games (feel free to skip):This game reminds me of the good ol' Rareware. Back in the 90ies and early 2000's before they sold their soul to Microsoft. Games made with love, attention to detail, heart and (and I can't believe that this is a trademark that needs to be pointed out) color. Games like Banjo-Kazooie, Conkers Bad Fur Day and weirdly enough this Ubisoft-Game stick out to me not just gameplay-wise, but also visually. They are bright where they need to be and dark when it is necessary - but they always ooze charme and liveliness. And to be fair - in its catalog of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and unpolished games, Ubisoft does have some amazing titles - Child of Light and Rayman come to mind. All these aforementioned games fall into a special kind of category for me. They all feel different and distinct from each other, but still weirdly similar. They all share the high quality anyways. But hey, maybe that is just me.About BG&E itself:Beyond good and evil is an action adventure mix without any outstanding design decisions, but everything that is in the game, is very well implemented, while still being kinda basic. There is a simple combat system, which doesn't reach the levels of a spectacle fighter - reminiscent of Starfox Adventures. There is a stealth system, but it isn't as deep as the likes of Metal Gear, Splinter Cell or Thief. There is some sense of Open-World-Exploration, but please don't expect GTA or Skyrim. There is photography, but (sadly) no Prof. Oak to evaluate your skills regarding capturing Snorlax' butt on polaroid. And there are racing-sequences, which...well they are rather tight actually - I lik'em.This game gives you a bit of everything in bitesized chunks and delivers a quite well presented story on the side. It is vast, but not intimidating. You can actually complete it 100% without doing a lot of unnecessary walking and searching - yet it feels rewarding. IMHO this is a game that you need to play to experience its appeal firsthand. Don't read about it, don't watch a Let's play - play it. It is really well polished, casts some memorable characters and, apart from the overall length of the game, does not leave much to be desired.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be perfectly honest I have no idea why this game gets all the praise it does, maybe I went into it with too high of expectations or maybe it just hasn't aged well but I was not blown out of the water by Beyond Good and Evil. That being said, it’s a good game. The combat is really fun, controls really well(outside of the flying parts) and it’s varied enough that it never really gets boring. The story, while not super amazing, is still pretty decent. There’s a lot they could have done with it that wasn’t done and with the namesake it has I really expected more out of the story. Even though the story was underwhelming the most standout part of this game, and the most enjoyable, is definitely the 100% believable female protagonist. It’s really nice to be able to play a woman who isn’t overly sexualized or a stereotypical manly, badass female. Unlike so many other female protagonist Jade is written like she’s a real, well rounded person. More writers need to play this game so they can learn how to write realistic characters, both female and male.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been interested in Beyond Good&Evil for a very long time but I never got around to picking the game up. Well, thanks to Steam I finally got a chance to try the game out for cheap, and MAN IS IT AWESOME! The game has a very intriguing storyline where, as Jade, you must use your skills as a photo-journalist...or a f***king ninja... to expose a sinister government ploy. ""Uncover the Conspiracy. Capture the Truth."" ALL the music in the game is just beautiful...seriously...DAT F**KING PIANO. Beyond Good&Evil also has a great visual style, which totally makes up for the graphical limitations of it's time. While playing through it, I just fell in love with the game. I loved all the interesting characters and it's whimsical tone, and I was very engaged in the story. I enjoyed Beyond Good&Evil IMMENSELY and it is easily one of my favourite games of all time.

												Beyond Good and Evil (German: Jenseits von Gut und Böse; subtitled ""Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future"" (German: Vorspiel einer Philosophie der Zukunft)) is a book by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, first published in 1886.It takes up and expands on the ideas of his previous work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but approached from a more critical, polemical direction.In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche accuses past philosophers of lacking critical sense and blindly accepting Judeo-Christian premises in their consideration of morality. The work moves into the realm ""beyond good and evil"" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.

Good puzzles, lots of secret bits and side games, plenty of stuff to do, varied ways of acheiving goals. Great music. Good character animation.Bad things: Horrible, horrible third person camera - disorienting, gets stuck, even gets you killed occasionally, so frustrating! Sometimes your companions block your path.

The fighting is fluid and the chase events blend smoothly into the cutscenes to the point where you'd believe it was your idea to jump off that rooftop all along!

												A re-release of a console based game designed for controller that doesn't actually have controller support. WHY? IT MAKES NO SENSE. Also, it appears to be buggy at certain parts. It's a shame, it looks like it was a great game. I'd recommend trying to get a console version because those are probably not as buggy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One the best games I've ever played, because it's filled with imaginative characters, storytelling, setting, art design and above all gameplay. While Beyond Good and Evil is brief, it packs plenty to love within its 10 or so hours. If you'll allow me a hyperbolic indulgence, I like to think this is the game Don Bluth wishes he made.

Highly recommended, though if you can get the HD remasters on PS3/360, I'd go with those as they don't have the issues this port does (which can be ironed out, however) along with updated texturesI'd nominate it for both ""Test of Time"" and ""Best Use of Farm Animal"" if I could ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great single-player adventure — it has aged a bit, but it's everything great you would expect from a game led by Michel Ancel and Christophe Héral. It is, in some ways, like a 3D Zelda title. It's mostly like this: explore, sneaking, hack-n-slash, and the occasional photo shooting. The pacing works well, the story keeps you hooked. Speaking of which, can't wait for that sequel...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Man, this gameThis is more than a 3rd Person beat em up, this is a 3rd person stealth adventure racing game with collecting elements and you CAN beat people up. The story is decent, but the characters are all very loveable, especially Jade, the spunky, tough tomboy you play as. You simply CAN'T play this game correctly without going out of your way to collect photos of the great amount of fauna that litters Hillys, competing in the races, or hunting down the pearls. You can probably go through most of the game pacifistically, but you can also kill everything in sight. Personally, it gives me a very Jak and Daxter feeling, and I find it very charming. This version is kind of a pain to play though, basically, what you have to do, is turn water reflections off and WHILE you're in game, go to your task manager, go to processes, right click BGE, go to affinities, and select only one core. The way it worked for me is you had to close the task manager and turn the game off, then turn it on again. Even then, there were some issues with the framerate and sound lag. It was annoying, especially at the end when there's a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥going on. But overall it's a very good game that I enjoyed nearly every second of, and I recommend it to all of you.

												An amazing game that apparently has been missed out on by far too many, Beyond Good & Evil is one of the best stories I've experienced in an adventure game. It has a unique style to it and the music sets the mood perfectly, for the lovely lighthouse shelter as well as the darkest strongholds of the evil aliens. I don't really know what to say about this game. It's about a young reporter named Jade, who lives with her uncle(Who happens to be a pig) in a lighthouse that shelters children who have lost their parents to the war against and evil alien armada, known as the DomZ. It's very cheap on steam, but it's worth so much more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beyond Good and Evil is such an interesting game. In my case, I enjoyed the storyline and the gameplay to the max. Plus, I can actually be a girl and not a boy like in most games. (Not trying to be a feminazi, but I hope you guys get my drift.) Aside from savig the world and whatnot, you get to learn about the background of the main character and others. Not only that, you get a job as a photographer and taking pictures of different creatures is quite fun. That is like the most relaxing thing in the whole game. (Unless you are actually fighting the creautre.) At certain levels, the enemies tend to be annoying or just a pain in your gut. This games has been in my faves since the first time that I played it on the playstation 2 and still is. I highly recommend it to everyone, it doesn't hurt to try it out. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It will take some tweaking to get it running properly, however once achived, it sure will pay of if you can oversee the dated graphics and a crash now and then. It is a well made mix of a 3D platformer, puzzler and combat game, with some intersting sidestories and a nice main plot. Old but still recomended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I first found Beyond Good & Evil as a used PS2 game in a Blockbuster and thought it looked interesting. The cover art was intriguing, and the basic description caught my attention. However, the first few times I tried to play the game, I could not get through it because I did not have the patience to solve some of the challenges. Then one day in college, I picked it up over a weekend, deciding to play for the heck of it and to finish it once and for all. Am I glad I did.The game immerses you in the story from the get-go, forgoing the typical long, drawn-out backstory. The characters are warm and engaging, and all of them, major and minor, are full of depth and life. This is the only game that can honestly make me say I was sad to leave the world when I completed it, and it is the only game I can pick up once every few months and play again, even though I already know the answers to all of the puzzles and where to find all of the hidden items. So imagine my heartbreak when my PS2 copy started to glitch each time I started a new file, and my joy finding that it is available on Steam for only ten dollars!This game was well-thought out and developed, and I can say without a doubt that it is my favorite game. I am proud to own both the original PS2 copy and now to own it on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half of the reason I bought this on Steam was to play back through it again.  The other half was so that I could recommend it.This one ranks right up there with Psychonauts as a fantastic, critially-acclaimed action-adventure romp that did not get the fanfare it deserved on its original release.  Like Psychonauts, it's not perfect; it's got its share of finicky controls, awkward combat and rebellious cameras, but the overall experience is well worth the trip.The original release did have a potentially game-breaking bug in one spot, but the fan-made patches to fix it are still available on the Internet if you happen to get stuck. (I'm not sure, but this version may or may not have been patched to prevent it.)  There's also a point-of-no-return that might frustrate you if you're shooting for 100% completion. (Hint: It's right after you buy the last part for your craft.)In short: It's cheap!  Buy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is just awesome it has it all, 3D platforming, 3rd person melee combat, first person shooting (via a weapon you pick up later in the game), puzzle solving, hovercraft racing (imagine a very cut down 'Wipeout' and you're close), flying sections, space combat sections.......it's a total package. There are stealth elements here, as well as side quests and a nicely evolving story line. The graphics though a few years old still look pretty nice in my opinion. I have played this game from start to finish 3 times, the only other game in recent memory that I have played that much is Half Life 2. So I would place this game in some highly esteemed company.On the down sides are that it can be a bit grindy (collecting items for ship upgrades), and in some situations the controls can be frustrating but in the main they work well.

												The gameplay was enjoyable even though I'm not a huge fan of games with stealth elements. There were quite many mini-games as well, which were fairly enjoyable too. The story was good and I will probably get the sequel, if it ever comes out on PC (currently in development for the next generation of consoles). Only real downside was the length of the game since I beat the game in about 11 hours and I collected and did everything during that time. There were only 3-4 quite lengthy missions in the game, each with a boss in the end.The game is kinda old though and doesn't work that well on modern computers. There were some graphical glitches at first but with a little bit of tweaking, I managed to make them disappear.Overall the game was good and I recommend playing it to everyone who likes stealthy action-adventure games.

												Great game! Legend of Zelda (exploration and ""dungeons"") mixed with Pokémon Snap (photographing animals) and Metal Gear (stealth). Also, all the characters are very likable.Not the best port, but with some tweaking it's very playable (and in proper widescreen). Although you can't use a gamepad natively, the controls for the mouse and keybord setup are very good (and can be rebinded).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty dated, but still good.PRO: Original, well-fleshed-out setting, great voice acting, varied gameplay mechanics including stealth, platforming, racing and 3rd-person-melee - fun, varied and intelligent.CON: too short, graphics are dated at best and screw up at worst, storyline gets a bit screwy at the end (I think it's a botched attempt at a twist. Its a ""twist"" with absolutely no foreshadowing and feels out of place).Worth getting. Felt like Ocarina of Time mashed with Banjo Kazooie with a unique strain of stealth blended in.

												If you have never heard of BG&E before don't worry, just go right ahead and buy the game. You don't need to read the rest of this review to enjoy it. Go on now.If you have heard of BG&E and haven't bought it yet, then I want you to first buy it, then go put your head onto a toilet rim, and smack yourself with the seat cover until BG&E has finished downloading onto your Steam account, you Ponzy. Yes for you slackers who have done neither and have chosen to keep reading BG&E is one of those game's that is akin to finding a pearl during a day at the beach. You sift through greyishrocks, and then you find a game so touching, and so chock full of variety you wonder why you were so lucky as to have found it. I will not go into detail on the story, the gameplay, as words cannot describe what a uplifting and amazing game BG&E is. Seriously this review is done. Buy it already.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had originally purchased this game shortly after it was released on Playstation 2. Tragically, I could never make a dent of progress in the game at the time because I didn't have a memory card for quite awhile. Nearly 10 YEARS went by before I saw this familiar face on Steam and decided to experience the game once and for all..and I am SO glad I did. Beyond Good & Evil is a great example of how a game with a simple story doesn't need violence, sexy aliens, or DLC to compete with today's sci-fi genre games. Instead- charming characters, beautiful music, gorgeous art style that has aged very well considering the advances in tech. A good portion of the game focuses on stealth aspects, though not as hardcore as the average -I CAUGHT YOU, YOU DEAD! game. Jade is one cool girl: she has a talking pig uncle, cares for orphans, full of energy and charisma that make her a believable character. Armed with only a staff, projectile launching glove, and a camera Jade must uncover the big secrets- about her planet Hillys, the alien race that seeks to harm them, as well as  a stunning introspection of herself.

												I call this game the original Mirrors Edge. An amazing storyline, amazing concept, utterly unique (especially for it's time!), but ♥♥♥♥♥♥ marketing. Thanks to that last slipup, this game was a sleeper hit, so not many people were really aware of this one until after the three month marketing was done. However! I preordered it when nintendo power bragged about it. Was never regretting that one. This game is deep, and I mean DEEP. One of the first great conspiracy stories in video games, expertly told with an underground, veneer peeling vibe. Not to give anything away, but the light and colorful starting world goes far beyond itself, showing how everything truly is. As philosophical as the title book was (Nietzche, don't get much more philosophical!), this story hits pretty close. But for you gameplay oriented people out there, this game is still good. It takes a bit of time to get used to antiquated controls and glitches, as this game was FAR smaller than most modern ones, but it created many of the engines later used. The camera support is very nice, the combat is fairly set up (but simple), but the majority of the game relies on caring about the world and the story, so if you like a good tale? Play this game. Help make them WANT to make the sequel we all need.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sure the graphics are outdated and some other things are not working as well as today's games but I still think this game is one of the best games that Ubisoft has ever made story-wise. I really like the open-world gameplay it has to it and the stealth parts are really working well too.Even though the graphics are a bit old I highly recommend playing it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like Zelda or, if you've never played on a console, Darksiders, this is a must have title. Great action adventure with lovable characters and a great story. It mixes combat with puzzles and racing and along the way you have the ability to search for pearls and take photos of different creatures. The graphics still hold up to this day and the game has a style of its own. It's fantastic !You shouldn't even be reading this, it's a game you should already own. But... if you still don't own it (naughty, naughty) you should get it immediately, it's really THAT good.[Rating: 92/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games I've ever played..(If you just want to see my rating of this game, scroll right down to the bottom)I once bought this game, almost ten years ago retail. Never managed to finish it back then, cue to my computer crashing. The new one couldn't handle the disc..But now, steam has it, and I finally got to finishing it.Great story, great gameplay, has some stealth, racing, photographing, good dungeons, puzzle solving, amongst other things. It has some camera issues though, you might get annoyed by the fact that the camera is a bit hard to handle sometimes.Overall, I've had a great experience. The story and characters are all great and well-made, and the gameplay is well done although you might think ""photographing as a gameplay element, what?""It is a bit shorter than many modern day games though, since back then you couldn't fit all that much onto a disc so it couldn't grow as massive as it wanted. (what I mean is, don't expect a twenty-hour long odyssey from this, I got through the whole game in just seven hours).For those who may be wondering, this game does not have multiplayer, it is singleplayer only. Meaning no versus, co-op or other such things.However, it is a bit poorly ported to the newer OS-versions, meaning that it will probably not be fully functional straight-off. Graphical and sound issues are the most common problems, and for some users it doesn't even start. However, ti did start for me, and the graphics bugs I fixed by turning off ""HW vertex processing"" in the advanced settings of the game's startup menu. The sound issue I've heard is related to multi-core, and mostly fixed by telling the game to use only one core. Still, I would recommend that you turn on subtitles, just in case. (it doesn't always work flawlessly with the voice, occasionally some pieces have been known to disappear..)Still, though, a really great game. To summarise, you should really consider buying this straight up, right now, if you don't mind a few problems, many which are quite easily fixed for some people. Of course, since these bugs vary from player to player I cannot know which ones you are going to have (for me only the graphical issues, along with some occasional missing sound in dialogue or music, were present. The repeating voice bug, was not) so therefore I will not take these bugs into consideration when rating this.If I disregard the problems that arrived when getting this to newer OS, this would get a solid 9/10 from me.Updated to remove a spelling error.

												I really wanted to enjoy Beyond Good and Evil. I'd only ever heard stellar reviews of the game. The cast of characters seemed interesting and dynamic. The game's art style appeared to have aged well. Even while playing it, I absolutely loved the soundtrack.But the game falls apart mechanically. Maybe it's just because the game was originally designed for Xbox and Playstation, and the PC port didn't get the love it needed. Maybe it was the fact that I used a mouse and keyboard instead of a controller. Whatever the reason, the game really left me disappointed.The stealth sections are clumsy, the camera is uncooperative and sometimes totally unresponsive, the combat is repetative, and the platforming sections are dull. Beyond Good and Evil feels like it's aspiring to be an action-adventure game the likes of Zelda, but it trips over itself and seems to miss the mark.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beyond Good and Evil was the first game that I played. I got a second hand PS2 for my birthday, and my parents let me choose one game with it. I was totally new to video games and I had no idea which game I should choose, so I just let the store owner recommend me a game. And so Beyond Good and Evil it was. Luckily the game was in Dutch (my native language). I was around 10 years old back then, and I couldn't understand English. I started playing the game, not knowing what to expect at all. I remember that the game made a lot of impact on me. Of course, this could be because of the fact that this was my first game ever, but eight years later I can tell you that it wasn't just because of that. It was because of the astonishing music, the amazing atmosphere, and the feeling I got when I figured out how to complete a part of the game all by myself, after looking for a walkthrough on the internet. So now it's eight years later, I've probably completed over a hundred other games, great ones too, but Beyond Good and Evil always had a special place in my heart. I've replayed this game over 20 times, and a couple of days ago I bought the PC version too. Beyond Good and Evil will always be one of my most favourite games, and I can highly recommend this game to everyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Contrary to what a lot of negative reviews are saying. I ran this on a Win 8.1 machine & had no issues with fast forwarding. I'm not saying that an issue does exist. I'm just saying this ran perfectly fine on my machine.Perfectly fine, with a couple exceptions. I had a crash to desktop right after finishing the final battle. I received the message ""No more memory"". This is odd as balls because my machine(like most out there today) is absolutely murdering the requirements. Memory wise I should have been able to run this game simultaneously MANY times over with little to no impact to my machine. Yet I still came up insufficient. This is just a minor annoyance, because on my next attempt, everything worked smoothly.I also encountered a few spots where the camera decided to be a complete d-bag & force me into a top down view or bottom up view, with no in between. This is not the smoothest of ports. & this issue was only compounded by the fact that I was using the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor Steam Controller. Putting those few issues aside. BG&E is a great game. If you have the option to play it on a console. DO THAT. If not this is a passable port if you can stomach a few minor irritations.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very average. It has aliens kidnapping people for energy, while the government backing up the aliens in secret. The world populated with random anthroprgonic animals that for some reason speak in a jamaican ascent. The main character, Jade, has a talking pig as an uncle. So far this is a pretty average descripting of the game. The most average part of this game is that it was made by Ubisoft before they sucked.

												+ fun camera mechanics to take pictuers of animals and monsters to earn credits and other currency+ for the most part, the stealth sections are pretty enjoyable and lenient+ great cast of characters+ music is varied and fun to listen to+ lots of stuff to find by exploring caves or locked doors around the town+ the game is VERY lenient on pearl acquisition. you'll need a butt load for some sections of the game and there are places to scrounge up quite a bit of them.+ story is fine. it's shallow but it gets the job done. it DOES do a good job as acting as a vehicle to give you more of a reporter/investigator role rather than pure combat.+ checkpoints are more than fair. Honestly you'll be saving to avoid the game crashing and losing progress as apposed to losing a fight. Dying in any room or fight usually just places you right before the encounter.- the most fighting you'll be doing in this game is against the camera. It's wonky, doesn't reset most of the time, and snaps you into awkward angles.- bugs. Jesus. This game is riddled with bugs. Sometimes its the AI partner freaking out but other times its more devious bugs like ""ran out of memory"" and you having to restart the game.- texture issues a plenty. I couldn't get the launcher to readjust and show me settings, so I had to live with my initial settings which had textures going bonkers throughout the whole game.- the cliffhanger...All in all it's something I think everyone should check out. The game itself is lots of fun but the running issues I noted above can slow your enthusiasm down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beyond Good and Evil is a 2003 Stealth Action-Adventure game developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind the Rayman series and also responsible for original titles like From Dust. Montpellier, as a creative powerhouse, delivered Beyond Good and Evil to critical acclaim, but devastatingly poor sales have infamously seen the sequel perpetually delayed.This is a horrible port, and you should not buy it. Beyond Good and Evil is not a perfect game. This is the only version of it I've played, so my experience is not all encompassing. However, I felt that most, if not all, of the problem with the game stemmed from what a horrendous port this is. It controls absolutely awful, because for a game that is designed solely for gamepads, it dictates that you use the keyboard and mouse. Trying to steer Jade while clicking away in haphazard combos isn't fun at all, along with common mishaps like sticking to walls and desperately waggling the mouse in radial-based menus like an idiot. There is no gamepad support for this game whatsoever, outside of using a clunky 3rd-party program like Xpadder. So that means when the game restricts you camera to a 2D plane, you just have to deal with it. When it decides to wrench your camera away for you for no apparent reason, you just have to deal with it. When you're desperately wrenching the mouse while janking the hovercraft with the WASD keys to get it around corners, you just have to deal with it.Those are just the control issues. Even after disabling a certain amount of options to get the game running at above a powerpoint rate (note: simply lowering the settings made the game perform even worse) I had constant plummets in framerate and constant graphical glitches. This port (not by Montpellier) makes Ubisoft's recent debacles look good.It is, however, a decent game. The gameplay is shallow, and the amount of distractions in the disappointingly small hub-world one-note, but the game is carried by the amazing art style and music. The art style speaks for itself, and the music is worth tracking down if you can. While not sold on the game's cult classic status, the game is a solid casual Action Adventure that doesn't demand much in the way of attention and delivers on the premise plenty. I'm not recommending this, not because you shouldn't play this, but because you shouldn't play this version. Play the HD version, emulate a console version, by Jove even dig out a sixth gen system and track down a physical copy if you're truly dedicated to playing this game and seeing what the hype is all about.Playing the Steam version of Beyond Good and Evil will only sour you on an already hard to sell game.

												This is one of those games that make me personally sad simply because of their lack of (deserved) commercial success. It fell through due to a badly timed release and lack of marketing - All the wrong reasons for a game to fail.For the laughably small price on Steam, you get a wonderful action adventure set in the stylish, spain-esque world of Hylis, a planet inhabited by humans and anthropomorphic creatures alike. The gameplay is reminiscent of Zelda and definitiv fun enough to keep you entertained, despite the lackluster sneaky passages; the story is great and the character design strong.I really can't say enough to praise this game, it is just enthralling in its own way. Pick this up if you like creativity in games and could use some rebellious action in the form of a brave young photographer and her friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A platform mixed with infiltration, some spaceship/hovercraft driving scenes and you also take pictures. Pictures are cool.The combat system is easy to grasp. It reminded me of times when playing a game was a different thing, not just action buttons or an fps mixed with other stuff. No! This one makes a good job out of being simple yet challenging, with a good story on it and a great soundtrack.Only thing I did not like was how tiring and big the first level was. However this still is a great game from an era when pressing a button meant more than seeing a pretty cutscene.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The hack n slashy battles, honestly, aren't that great and for the most part unmemorable. If they do a sequel, they should remove either stealth or hack n slash and focus on making the other stronger. Collecting pearls and  mdisks is fun. The little diversions and sidequests like racing and the pallet game are good too. Its really the world and the diversions that make this game memorable.4/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beyond Good and Evil is pretty much a hidden gem, imo. I was too young to really play it during its original run, but I heard some good reviews about it, so I decided to pick up the PC version to see what was up.Right off the bat, BG&E is definately a beautiful game for something from 2003; the artstyle kinda helped it to age a littttleee bit better. Also oh my god, the soundtrack. Good stuff. The game is ahort at about 8 to 10 hours if you just power through it, so it's definately a game I'd reccomend to people looking for something to spend a weekend with, but there is a bit of stuff for completionists to do, (namely snappig some pictures of Hillyan wildlife that you might notta caught the first time around, and searching for all the pearls in game) and for that, I'm actually gonna be playing this a second time through!Gameplay on foot consists of a lotttaaa stealth. I don't really find the combat to be something to really write home about, but there's a lot of varied gameplay going on like hoverboat races, and some chases on foot and in vehicle. Overall, the game kinda tries its hand at pretty much everything, which is admirable, but it makes it so nothing really is as stellar as it coulda been. Not saying it's bad, just some elements of gameplay are better than others and everyone's gonna kinda have some elements that pop out a lil more to them than others.Overall, good game with a lotta varied gameplay that makes the 8-10 hours you'll spend on just the campaign interesting with a distinct art style and an A+ soundtrack. If the store description or any gameplay footage piques your interest, you'll probably like Beyond Good and Evil. A word of warning though, it's glitchy on modern OS's, especially Windows 8 and 10. I personally made this more playable by running the .exe in compatibility mode set on XP service Pack 3, but stilllllll had some minor audio and graphical glitches. Community discussion page offers some more fixes if you're looking to get it a little closer to the original, but if you're not in the mood for fiddling around, there's and HD version on XBL and PSN~			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For the record, this is an already kind of iffy port of a console game that can run pretty poorly on some newer hardware. I've had a lot of trouble getting it to even run. Buyer beware. Game itself seems fun, but it might be more worthwhile to track down a console version if you have something to play it on (the 360 and PS3 HD versions seem to run fine, so maybe look into those).

												Beyond Good & Evil is a wonderful game, but the Steam version lacks controller and widescreen support, and it's filled with bugs if you use Windows Vista, 7, or 8. I've only tested this version with Windows 7, but I've heard similar criticisms about the game experiencing problems on Windows Vista and I doubt it runs any better on Windows 8. If you want to play this game with controller and widescreen support in 1080p with far less bugs, I highly recommend checking out Beyond Good & Evil HD for the PS3 and Xbox 360. It has its issues, but you're likely to have a much better experience with it than this version. I've also heard the GOG version has less bugs for modern operating systems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, the PC port is not great. You need to fiddle with the game quite a bit just to run it on a modern PC. Cutscene sound is badly out of sync and I've only managed to partially reduce the issue by limiting the game to one CPU core and running external applications to launch the game. You will also need to disable HW Vertex Processing in advanced graphics options to get rid of the flicker. It also seems that gamepads are not supported, but the M&K layout works just fine, though it's not entirely intuitive.The game itself feels very dates and doesn't seem to have aged well. The plot is ok, but not very fleshed out. A classic story of a protagonist with exceptional powers, the nature of which is only slightly hinted at at the end of the game itself. The world doesn't feel real.The controls are clunky, Combat mechanics are pretty bad. It's mostly a game about sneaking with combat being an annoying afterthought, until you get to fight the final boss.On the bright side, the checkpoints are reliably placed all over the place and you never have to backtrace to much.As a whole, I would recommend to watch the plot summary on YouTube and play something much more mechanically enjoyable.

												Fantastic game ruined completely by total trash final boss design. The fight is so grating and difficult for me that it's just about like chewing on concrete bricks. I loved the whole game up to that point too. I know some people may find it easy, but it was absolutely infuriating for me. Another game that I'll probably never finish.Edit: Turns out it wasn't my skills that were the problem, I evidently suffer from a game breaking glitch. So chalk up the cruddyness to a terrible port. I ended up just watching the end on YouTube, and as it turned out it wasn't worth it at all. It's so abrupt. I'm so disappointed right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: March 5, 2016
												6/10.  The game is good in terms of plot, but once again, like Deep Space, I cannot give a thumbs up due to the controls on PC keyboard.  It became obvious that this is a controller game based on the way the character loses behind the shoulder pov and goes to side scroller type, making it extremely difficult to get the main character to perform as you want.  It doesn't mean it's impossible, it's merely frustrating as heck and required repeated plays in areas due to deaths that had nothing to do with fights.  I had to play the game in short bursts rather than enjoy it in consecutive sittings.  So you are warned about the controls before you choose to purchase the game to play with a PC Keyboard.   Pros:-Story-Length-Music-Jamaican RhinosCons:-Keyboard controls-Changing camera pov-Last boss fight with reverse controls and never-ending repeated hitting in a pattern (I clocked 31 times in a row with no effect before throwing in the towel.  If I happened to have had 99 K-lives as suggested before going into the final battle, maybe I would eventually have seen the end).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had a lot of video/sound sync problems but there is a legit easy way to solve it. When first running the game click through the multiple options and put the fps on 60Hz MAXIMUM. Every option higher than 60Hz is causing syncing problems. This game just isn't made for 144Hz. So solve any sync problem by putting frames per second on 60Hz. It's a great game that should get more appreciation in my opinion! If you already skipped this option, try setting your monitor to 60Hz, that works as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This version runs (for me) at rapid speeds, far faster than it should. Cutscenes play out and I hear the vocals from a half minute ago, or longer, play out. I tried to get this fixed for several hours, attempted many fixes, every possible setting change (resolution changes were unlisted by default and required a workaround to alter) and the speed could not be fixed at all. I'm sure this version works for most, and the game is certainly worth playing. But for me, the sync issues being apparantly unfixable, and broken to start with, made this an unplayable experience.

												A great game made unplayable by lack of controller support.Thanks to Steam I'm finally able to play Beyond Good and Evil, a game that I (like many others) missed on it's initial release.It really does live up to the hype as a great game.  Interesting story and characters, good graphics (for the time), fun gameplay with a wide variety of gameplay mechanics...but that last point really falls apart considering this port has no controller support and forces you to play with keyboard and mouse which would be fine for a point and click game but for an action adventure game like this it's just an exercise in tedium.Damn shame...I'm not sure I'll finish the PC version.

												Obviously surprising to most readers of this review, I didn't like the game. Please read all of it before bashing it though. It seems like everybody and their mother claims this game to be one of the best and beg for a sequel. I disagree. I only finished the game for the first time, never played it before. Maybe if I played it when younger I'd have some nostalgic factor or something, but that wouldn't actually mean the game is good... because the game is just not that good.The game, first off, is really, really simple, which isn't something I mean negatively. There's many simple modern games I enjoy, like Fable, so that isn't a bad point. The problem is that all of the simple ""pieces"" don't really work as expected. Before getting into the game, just a quick brush on graphics and such, though those don't really sway my opinion of a game. The graphics weren't bad, rough in places, but overall pretty decent for years back. The sound, on the other hand, was only okay. People seem to love the soundtrack, but all in all it was pretty average and had nothing exciting.The only song that stood out to me was out on the sea early in the game, the peaceful one reused at the beginning of the credits. It was really nice and I loved that one. Besides songs, the dialogue was decent. Audio sync didn't really cause many problems for me, only once or twice.Now, onto the game. The characters were all lackluster. I didn't really care about any of them, even the kids. The only one I liked was Pey'j. Jade didn't really stand out as a special protagonist, though I did feel a little twinge at a couple places near the end (mostly due to Pey'j). The kids were really only used at the beginning and end... and the same goes for Secundo. And Double H was sooooooo annoying. I really, really hated him. His voice and style was the most generically annoying possible.When it came to the NPCs in terms of gameplay, it was a waste. They served virtually no purpose other than to move around a couple puzzles and to bash their special ability during combat. But they served to make combat more annoying. They just stood around, got attacked, and got pinned to the ground. I wanted to give them PA-1's, but I needed the health usually! Friendly fire made it worse, because they just stood in my way and often I would take off half a heart because they'd get hit.Boss fights weren't good except for the final two bosses. All of the others were so simple and easy that I beat them all in less than 90 seconds each, some even less than 1 minute, because most of them were usually bashing the same pattern without thought. The first boss you could even beat without being touched, and without any effort.The controls in the game were pretty wobbly, usually because of the camera, which would bounce around. In most of the levels, the confines were relatively cramped, so the camera bounced all over for me. I'd be seeing through walls or the ground, and could barely keep things focused. If you walk near certain walls, the camera would jump 180 degrees, so during combat, it was even more terrible. I'd often end up hitting random things or thin air.Stealth wasn't that special. It was semi-enjoyable, but in some places the controls and camera made it worse. In one level (I think the Slaughterhouse? Or the one before it), there was sneaking through a foggy area, but it took me several tries to get through. It was really simple in idea, but my camera got stuck and I was always looking into the ground and at Zoey, all in the fog, so I could see nothing. It kept moving even if I centered the camera, so I could barely see the enemies. Other places were relatively annoying too, and all in all it just wasn't that fun or special.The story was pretty generic, really. Oh no, people are betrayed and getting abducted by aliens? That's pretty much all it amounted to the entire game, except for the last 5 minutes. But because I lost interest by that point, the last 5 minutes of revealings didn't make me care any more or want a sequel. The aspect of using a camera as a special spy was interesting at first, but everything was generally repetitive, so nothing special.Lastly, exploration was a bummer. I expected there to be a bit more to the world. I didn't expect something crazy... but there really wasn't much at all. The 4 races, meh. The 4 looter's caverns, meh. I mean, I did them all, and they were okay, but not much else opened up in the world as the game progressed. Only a couple more dungeon-like areas, but most were short.And the biggest annoying part of that... the city. I really, really liked the looks of the city going into it at first. I expected it to open up more throughout the game and was excited about it. You get a city pass and I thought, finally! But you move like 50 more feet and hit another wall. So basically, for a decently-sized city, you get to explore none of it. They could have really made it bigger. A few alleys was really disappointing.Anyway, everything culminated into a disappointment. I'm not complaining because of overhyping; I'm just stating that the game was generally flawed in almost all of its aspects. I have absolutely no desire to replay it, while there are many other games I have replayed or will replay through the years.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
