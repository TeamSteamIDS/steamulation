												Honestly, the best game of its kind. It has some of the wittiest and most amusing story lines ,dark and mature mixed with tragedy that will take you by surprise.Beautiful visual design, great mix of colors and nicely put together levels that will remind you of Tim Burton's films. Voice acting & dialogues are excellent as you would come to expect with Tim Schafer produced games.Fun combat & platforming mechanics, they serve their purpose but are nothing ground breaking and some of the segments can overstay their welcome slightly.One part i found was annoying was that you have to grind for money to purchase an item to progress further, which interrupts the pacing somewhat.All in all a great title which is sadly overlooked by people. Highly recommend to any one who likes FUN.			",163,30,8,11,10,1,7

												(I could have sworn that I had already wrote a review of this, but oh well)Psychonauts, one of the last great 3d platformers. Straight from the mind of Tim Schafer. 9/10+A distinctive, and interesting visual style+A fleshed out, imaginative world+Some of the funniest diologue this side of... well... Grim Fandango+Odd, interesting characters+An awesome soundtrack+Clever, and unconventional level design (I feel like pointing out The Milkman Conspiracy, Lungfishopoplis, and the Velvet stage)+Psychic bears-The texture work is very dated-I should not have to look in the key bindings to figure out how to do a certain command when there is a forty-five minute long tutorial!-You guys did not buy this game, and therefore there will never be a sequel (or a remake)			",213,26,5,18,15,1,24

												Psychonauts is this type of game, that was made with love and passion firstly and business strategy lastly in mind.On the positive side: Art vision and design level are top notch. Every world in game feels, looks and plays very differently; Original premise for story and whole plotline is very engaging; Clever and funny writing; New powers (12 in total, which is more than enough) unlocked through the game make gameplay fresh till the end;On the negative side: Some collectibles are very hard to see, so collecting them could be frustrating experience; Sometimes camera decides you are having too much fun and it is time to make your life worse; Cutscenes pre-rendered in a low resolution (800x600 i think). Because of that they look very bad;tl;dr: you should play it if you like platformers/adventure, good original story, creative art and want something unique to experience.			",289,42,10,46,24,2,33

												Psychonauts hails from a golden age of gaming where developers poured passion into their creations and weren't completely drunk with greed. Great story, crafty gameplay and plenty of achievements and collectables. One of the most creative and original games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Highly entertaining, highly recommended. Play this game.			",153,18,5,26,7,0,20

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Psychonauts Original Release: 2005 Genre Tags: Adventure; RPG; Platformer; Lighthearted; Psychedelic My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-25 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamersREVIEWPsychonauts is a quirky and imaginative action-adventure game that is an absolute riot.  It is an aging specimen, but it will forever hold a status as a highly enjoyable “cult classic.”  If it has piqued your interest, then I suggest you take a complimentary cup of Kool-Aid and join the cult… you won’t regret it.Psychonauts excels at many things.  The story, the characters, and the writing are all top-notch and well-executed.  The scenes and developments throughout the campaign are quite amusing and should keep you thoroughly entertained.  The many different characters are all interesting in their own way.  They are all splendidly eccentric and unique, if not also reminiscent of typical Saturday-morning-cartoon archetypes.  And, importantly, the voice acting is mostly decent and sufficiently holds everything else together… although it does falter slightly, on occasion.   Providing setting for the narrative is a very inspired and diverse gameworld that is quite atmospheric.  The graphics used are undeniably dated and are only increasingly falling farther behind the curve; however the developers did an outstanding job of matching the environments and atmosphere to the overall soul of the game.  There is a mixture of lighthearted, noir, cartoonish, and psychedelic ambiances which really diversifies the experience as you play through the campaign.   You may not be awed by the scenery like in modern games, but you can still easily appreciate the effort that was put into the creation of the gameworld.Of course, the intriguing narrative and captivating atmosphere would be for naught if the gameplay wasn’t enjoyable.  Luckily, Psychonauts is quite fun to play.  There is a pleasant mixture of combat situations and puzzle-solving that you would expect from a game like this.  Situations can be approached by experimentation with various abilities and skills, which you unlock as you progress through the campaign.  Also, the various levels will introduce different dynamics to keep you on your toes.  There are also a ton of collectibles and many achievements to keep you busy, if you are into that kind of thing.Psychonauts can easily appeal to a wide and diverse audience.  The tone is fairly childish, but has many adult themes.  It is also a pretty easy/casual experience, so there shouldn’t be any skill issues.  It takes approximately 14 to 22 hours to complete, depending on if you strive for achievements or not.  If you like 3D action-adventure platformers, I would say this is a pretty safe bet for you.  It is also a good bet for anyone who may be interested in “seeing what the fuss is about,” as you will probably find it enjoyable once given a try.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												     Personally this is my favorite Double Fine game. Although it is about nine years old it still holds up as a good game with an interesting art style. Unlike most games built as an atempt at photorealism, the extremely cartoonish graphics and garish colour palette still looks good almost a decade after release. As all games from Tim Schafer the writing is magnificent, the voice acting is well done and the characters always have something important or hilarious to say. The setting of a Summer camp for Psychics not only influences the plot and gameplay but the dialogues actually sound like something children at summer camp would be saying, except that they are about the outlandish topics involved with a world surrounded by psychic weirdness. The gameplay is devided up into two sections, the overworld with some, but not much combat, sidequests, the one shop in the game, and most of the colorful non-essential dialogue, and the insides of the various character's minds. These minds serve as the various levels of the game, each with the same basic controlls but slightly different gameplay. The Meat Circus level is all about fast paced platforming, whilst Lungfishopolis is completely based on the combat system, and the Milkman level(BEST LEVEL EVER) is an old school inventory adventure puzzle mixed with a fever dream X-Files Plot. Throughout the game you gain psy powers that are used in combat and level navigation, some work as a long range attack with the need to collect ammo, and there is a bouncy ball/parachute power that makes platforming much more difficult and interesting.     Now that i have sufficiently gushed about all the things i freaking love about this game it is time to get realistic and talk about the flaws. Most of these flaws have to do with the fact that this was Double Fine's first attempt at an action game. the combat can be a bit annoying with enemy spamming getting overdone at times, that being said most of the basic enemies are too easy to dispatch and clearing the room becomes simply a chore without much actual difficulty. The controlls are somewhat soft and the platforming would be vastly improved by tighter controlls to allow for fine tuned navigation. and if you watch a let's play you can see that the dificulty scale starts off low but when it does ramp up it does so without telling you and later levels,(Milkman,Meat Circus) can become frustrating and take forever to get past, not allways from dificulty of combat or platforming but in the milkman level if you do not know what you are doing it can be almost impossible to figure some of the puzzles out organically.     All that being said these flaws are really not as bad as it sounds. the increased difficulty lends less to frustraton and more to angry inspiration to just beat this next level and prove that you are better than the game. and for the milkman, a quick glance at a gameFAQ can help if you get too badlt stuck, enough people have been frustrated by the level to have wonderfull walkthroughs made to relieve the tension. in the end the story and experience is so good it makes up for any akwardness in gameplay. 8/10, This game is a love it or hate it, and i love it, fantastic but not even close to perfect.

												Psychonauts has to be one the greatest Adventure/Platformers of our time, it succeeds in achieving the best aspects of the genre. The controls are tight allowing for great platforming and visually still looks better than most games today. The Steam version of Psychonauts is brilliant, I have not experienced a single bug and it supports HD. The exploration this game offers is top-notch, you get to explore a large camp littered with clever secrets and challenges along with some of the most insane levels. The combat is entertaining, especially since you get decent upgrades and new powers as you go along, allowing you to form more strategies so it never feels like a boring slogfest.The art direction of Psychonauts is unlike any other game and is vibrant and unique, you have to wonder what the devs were on when making some of the characters and the sound/soundtrack do their job pretty well. The way this game progresses in terms of difficulty and design is persistent and can get fairly challenging later on in the game. The dialogue is extremely well done adding a lot of life to some of the strangest looking characters in video gaming. The game features a dark/twisted humour which adds to the hilarity of the situations you encounter.This game gets much better the further you get, the levels get much more abstract and crazier, theres a few here which are total masterpieces and the plot is surprisingly deep for a game of this nature and extremely entertaining. The amount of imagination put into this game is amazing, the art direction is it's own, the characters are brilliant, the level design is solid, the combat and platforming are tight, the atmosphere is effective, the humour is hilarious as hell and never feels like they tried hard to make it that way, so it doesn't feel forced like many other games that try achieve a comical effect and is loaded with charm, there really is nothing negative about this game. To get this on Steam is a no brainer as it's an incredibly solid experience that should be experienced by anyone who appreciates Adventure and platforming games and timeless classics. Squirrels are liars.


Awesome level

												A superb underappreciated game with some of the most creative levels, writing and design I've seen in a game. It falls a little bit short when it comes to the gameplay aspects of it (e.g. clunky platforming), but it doesn't ruin the experience in the slightest. The musical score of the game also deserves a special honorable mention. It is absolutely worth its' price in my opinion.			",41,11,1,2,1,0,9

Posted: November 13, 2016
 Psychonauts is one of the best games I’ve ever played. In this long post I will describe in detail why that is true. Psychonauts is a 3D platformer game with very peculiar art style, great characters and awesome story line. 1. Story & Characters  (Spoiler Free don’t worry)The main place where almost every action of the game takes place is a summer camp for children with psychic abilities (Something like X-Men). The main character is named Razputin, Raz for short, a young child which goes alone to that summer camp without his father’s permission.There are around 20 kids in the camp and you can interact with every one of them. There are also a couple of adults which are training the young psychics. The main story is very interesting and will hook you in. I don’t want to say anything related to it because I don’t want to spoil something unintentionally All children[i.imgur.com]2. Gameplay & Graphics.The gameplay is very solid; you have a lot of things to do. The game feels very open world to me. It has 6 separated locations plus a couple more which are not placed on the map. The game features very common gameplay mechanics: Double jump (later on you will acquire something with which you will jump even higher), normal punch attack and 3 slots for special attacks. I highly hope you will ignore the graphics, because they are not so good and hope you will give the game a chance.I highly doubt they will remaster it so no need to wait.3.  Level design.This by far is the best aspect of the game. They are so well made, with high attention to details -  almost perfect. I will always remember 2 levels in my mind: Waterloo World and Milkman Conspiracy.  Both are in the later part of the game. The Waterloo World has such awesome ideas and I will try to explain it without any spoilers. In that level your body can exist in 3 states - Large (normal), medium and small. In order to beat the level, you need to switch between the states and interact with stuff whereby you can’t in other states. Milkman Conspiracy is so abstract it makes you question your sanity (Please don’t think it’s too deep). There are very nice gameplay mechanics in this level and you need to get used to it quite fast so you can beat it (A lot of backtracking for achievement hunters). Almost every level introduces its own gameplay mechanic. And that’s why the game is so good. You never feel bored with it.4. Comedy.Comedy plays a big part in the game. Almost every character is funny on its own. You’ll never feel that a joke is forced. Every joke is balanced and put right on spot. There are 2 abilities which I used more often than necessary, just because they made situations way funnier. The first ability is called Bacon - when you use it, a character appears in your mind and tells you his advice on the current situation, points out weak spots for the boss fights and sometimes makes funny jokes. The other is an ability acquired later on the game, which allows you to see yourself through the eyes of others and - oh, boy - I laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off with that. The developers put a lot of effort into this ability to show different pictures of you for everything that you can view yourself through. I’m sure I did not get all the jokes and I’m sure there are many more. Seen by a thing which loves cake[i.imgur.com]5. Abilities & Ranking system.There are in total 101 PSI cadet ranks. Once you have gathered a PSI Core combined with 9 PSI cards to it, you are granted a cadet rank. You need to buy a lot of PSI Cores from the in-game shop. There is no such thing as a skill tree in this game. The game gives you abilities when you reach certain cadet rank.6. AchievementsThis is for all who are going to attempt to get all achievements:Most achievements are fairly easy and you will find no problem getting them. Many are story related so you can’t miss them. A couple are quite tricky because if you progress too far in a current level you can’t obtain them anymore.  I used a spoiler-free guide to see when I should take a minute and visit a place.There are 3 very hard achievements:  ""I LOVE PUNCHING!"" I think this achievement takes place in the very first big level and - oh, boy, believe me - it’s very hard. The problem is that it requires skill but the controls are poorly done for PC users. It’s a living nightmare to do it with keyboard and mouse. I’ve read that it’s easier to achieve with controller. I’ve put in a lot of effort to obtain it. (You will need this achievement for “Math is Hard” achievement)Another very hard achievement is called:""Math is Hard"". If you are a collectible hunter by nature you will find no problem in getting this achievement. Briefly explained: you need to collect everything before the POINT OF NO RETURN. And yes there is a certain point where you can’t go back. Personally I’m not a big fan of such implementations, because everyone can ♥♥♥♥ up. At least they put a handy “Save” with the same name (POINT OF NO RETURN) and if you think you’ve missed something you can reload that save and complete those things you’ve missed.The last “hard” achievement is actually not hard at all. It requires you to buy an item from the in-game store (it’s not micro-transaction) on Christmas. I know you can change your PC date and get the achievement very easily, but since Christmas is very close I decided to wait.7. CollectiblesThere are 7 types of collectibles: Figments, Vaults, Emotional Baggage, PSI cards(PSI cards+core), Scavenger hunt items, Brains and Cobwebs. In any part of the map, when you open the menu it shows how many collectibles you can find. There are a lot of figments - like 100 per level and sometimes they blend so much with the level itself it is hard to find them. Vaults are really interesting,  they share screenshots of a certain character’s past and it’s made like an old movie - I love those. There are very messed up vaults which really can affect your mood after seeing them. Emotional Baggages are collected in a strange way. Imagine it to be doors -  you need to find the key and the door itself; sometimes you will find the door before the key.  Usually on every part of the map there are a certain number of PSI cards and like 1 PSI Core (with cards). There are 16 scavenger hunt items in total and some are quite hard to find. Once you gather 8, you are granted 4 levels at once. When you find the rest you get another 4 levels.  Cobwebs are tricky because you need a tool from the in-game shop in order to collect them. Usually there are 5-6 per level. Once gathered you can redeem them for PSI cards.Overall they are fun to collect. You need all of collectibles for “Math is Hard” achievement.All collectables[i.imgur.com]8. How I got to know of this game.FunHause YouTube channel is a channel which I watch very often. One of the members of this channel kept talking about this game non-stop and eventually I checked it out. His name is James  Williems9. Psychonauts 2The game raised 3.5 million dollars through crowdfunding from investors and other people. And I’m super-duper hyped for the second game. They even gave James Williams a voice acting role because he did an insane job popularising the game. Video from the developers10. Final verdict and thoughts.On a scale from 0 to 10, I will give  Psychonauts 9/10 without a doubt. It’s one hell of a good game and with this kind of a review I hope it made you check it out yourself. Huge respect to Double Fine for creating such a good game.Awesome credit picture[i.imgur.com] ",239,53,11,20,20,4,19

												My previous review of this game did not do it justice since I felt it deserved better than that - I'd like to elaborate a bit further on why I love this game ever so much as one of the best innovative games/platformers of all time. Growing up with 2D and 3D platformers like Mario, Crash & Spyro I could easily adapt to the platforming of the game. The platforming itself is solid enough but the actual combat in the game, during times like Boss Battles, can be dodgy as heck if you don't have a controller in handy -- Usually because of several different buttons needed to lock-on enemies and attack or alternatively dodge incoming attacks. You have the option of changing the keys to fit a play-style suitable for yourself, but I still find it frustrating at best namely due to the several important commands required. Here's my advice: Play the game with a controller as it'll make gameplay a bit smoother. So, what makes the game exceptional? Well, first of all it's the premise. The setting is a summer school camp for psychics. The game is brought to us by none other than the master of adventure games, Tim Schäfer (Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle), whose characteristic sense of humor certainly blooms in Psychonauts. One of the long running concepts of Schäfer's style usually juxtaposes a rather mundane situation in a fantastical setting; Such as what you'd expect if Tim Burton & David Lynch teamed up for an all-wacky-superstar tag team line up movie. Which is just as well because creator Tim Schäfer has now acquired his very own Johnny Depp, in form of Jack Black, although he's absent from this game. But I digress - We play as Raz, who's chosen to flee from the circus as opposed to joining it, because being a Psychonaut is a lot more fulfilling than the circus obviously. As he gets accepted into the fold of Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp he soon finds himself in the middle of a strange conspiracy, where the brains of the camp's inhabitants mysteriously vanish which leads to the game's funniest moments. The caricatures that show up in the game are so incredibly diverse and... weird? They are truly fascinating as you get to DIG your way inside their subconscious minds to discover their true hidden feelings. Essentially, Schäfer came up with the idea of Inception before... well Inception. This is the unique part of the game - The environments, atmosphere and overall feel of the inner & deepest thoughts of the camp and local areas inhabitants's minds.Let me sum up some of the fascinating characters. We have a mad dentist who harvest brains, a talking fish whose thoughts involves a sequence where you become a giant Godzilla monster terrorizing a society of talking fish, a mentally ill security guard who's lost in the mindset of a crazy pyromaniac-milkman, Napoleon Bonaparte and his dimwit descendant, An aspiring musical starlet whose cruel mother's treatment of her and eventual suicide has caused her to develop a case of bipolar disorder, a government agent who disguises himself as a housewife by brandishing a rolling pin while talking disjointedly about pies etc. These are the kind of characters you can expect alongside the campers themselves and the local counselors, whom all are very well rounded and have their own personalities. Usually they are defined by interacting with them around the camp or examining the local signs and written letters, to provide character depth. Lastly, I found myself jamming to the game's cool blues-inspired guitar stringing soundtrack. All in all It's seemingly -- Well done. If you love a good platformer, with some dodgy gameplay at times, while every now and then laughing your♥♥♥♥♥off and maybe, just maybe, find yourself sympathizing with some of the loonies, as you uncover their hidden feelings. Then look no further than Psychonauts! :)			",78,20,0,11,1,0,4

												Psychonauts is like a book with a weird cover. It's a game worth getting into though, even if your eyes might not agree with the art design. Once I got past my nitpicking, I finally gave it the shot it so very deserved. Psychonauts is a 3D platformer meets an adventure game and honestly, I had no idea about the former. As with all platformers, you'll die plenty from falling, which is partly due to a fixed camera and partly cos you suck. Then there are a couple of areas that just aren't very forgiving, but it's nothing you can't overcome. I'd say the difficulty level is just right for this sort of game, apart from the initally daunting and almost sadistic Meat Circus.It's funny, charming and fun to explore. Finding collectibles is made enjoyable, but you'll have to look out for a Point of No Return, otherwise you won't get 100%. The music from Milla's Dance Party is still in my head, a level that reminded me of the club mission in DmC Devil May Cry. I doubt Ninja Theory were influenced by Psychonauts, these games being such opposites, nevertheless I found it amusing.First Double Fine/Tim Schafer game now under my belt and I'll be checking out more from them. If it weren't for the massive development budgets we have right now, we'd see more cool games like these. Games like No One Lives Forever 3, which I'm still rooting for.			",207,32,4,5,7,0,3

												When i look at the steam screenshots of this game i remember how i doubted this game so much. In fact the pictures from the camp display the worst parts of the game - The parts that took me so long to actually complete when i had the game as i just couldn't see the brilliance in this title by playing it a bit and looking at the pictures.  And who could have? the screenshots dont just justice at all to this game. Trailers? not much either. You have to experience the weird worlds and platforming that takes place yourself.  Everyone probably has this game in their libraries but how many have actually played it? install it now and play it - with time. Don't try to half♥♥♥♥♥it as this title demands some effort from the player too before the hook sinks in. But once it does it sits in pretty hard. I was sold around the time i did the paranoid kids 'spy-vs-spy' kind of world and the colorful bull-run world and that was later in the game.  That's all i want to say about this. Good luck finding all the figments.			",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

												So I picked up Psychonauts in 2016 for $1. People spoke pretty highly of this game, and I wanted something that could run on my laptop, so I got it. It took me about 20 hours to beat (longer than expected) and now that I have, I must say this game is absolutely brilliant. It's not perfect, it can be frustrating and the design isn't as polished as it could be, but I soon reached a point where I was so invested in the characters and storyline I was willing to put up with these blemishes in order to see things through.I'd like to start with the biggest strength of the game: the levels. In the game, you have to stop this sinister plot of lobotomies and kidnappings, and you do so by traveling into the minds of various people, often as a means of getting them to aid you. As such, most of the levels consist of navigating a specific mind, and each mind/level has its own unique aesthetics, mechanics, and tasks to complete. For instance, there's a level in here where you explore a mind that takes the form of a sprawling metropolis, and you play as a Godzilla-like monster that destroys it. The goal of this level is to destroy a tower in the center of the city, there are tanks and other anti-Godzilla weapons, and you get introduced to a shield, which you pretty much have learn to use to beat this level. There's another level where you encounter a mind that places you as a piece in board game. You have to talk to the other pieces (they have fun things to say), and deliver them food or money or munitions in order to deploy them and beat your opponent. This level involves some tricky platforming and light puzzle-solving, and I personally loved its aesthetic. A lot of these levels also feature their own boss/bosses, each of which is as unique as the environment they inhabit, and you'll have to figure out their vulnerabilities and how to exploit them.Since the levels are based on the minds of people you meet, you will encounter all sorts of interesting, complex people. I developed an emotional attachment to many of them which really gave me a sense of satisfaction in beating the various levels. For instance, you meet someone in anguish over a lost love, and it was so cathartic helping that character let go. And many of these characters are not all they seem. You may also punch, levitate, and attempt to ignite many of these characters to hear them make all sorts of indignant responses.I want to touch more on the gameplay. It's a third-person platformer from the PS2 era. Seems pretty bland, but they give you a whole slew of psychic powers and a diverse selection of enemies to use them on. I very much enjoyed the combat, though I wasn't much of a fan of the platforming. (This is partly because I'm not very good at platformers and because I played the whole game with a mouse an keyboard.) There were parts of the game where I'd jump, miss, and then get bumped back to the last checkpoint and have to do it over again. That being said, I feel like the game has enough checkpoint to not be too maddening or punishing. The game really gets difficult towards the end, make no mistake of that, but it's doable if you have the patience.Speaking of frustration, the game does have some annoying design issues. Remember, this is an old game. Because it's third person, sometimes the camera decides to jump behind a wall and you lose sight of your character. The game also gives you a lock-on tool to assist in aiming, and sometimes it doesn't recognize a target and points you in the opposite direction you wanted, and that causes you to miss your window of attack. And there are some glitches like where your character gets stuck, but you can normally jump around to free yourself. Again, if you have the patience, these aren't too damning.In conclusion, the game is clever in its world-building, characters, and gameplay, just remember that it's an old, tough platformer.

												I'm not normally a fan of platformers; I get frustrated far too easily.Psychonauts, though, is different.It's easy enough to be entertaining, well-written (silly dialogue and nods to pop-culture abound), and the voice-acting is amusing and well-performed.On some video cards, the background and some scenery may flicker, but it's not bad enough to affect play.

												This is easily my favourite Double Fine game, and that's saying a lot.At its core this is a third person action adventure platform title, but such a dry description really does not do it justice.It is happiness and nostalgia distilled into a quirky game about getting into people's minds, literally.No generic fire level, ice level, jungle level.Let's visits MINDS.The mind of a war veteran.The mind of a painter obsessed with bullfighting.The mind of a faded actress.THE MIND OF A SEA MONSTER.A great story, a great cast, a great WORLD created for you to explore and discover.Yes, the game has some balance issues, but most of these have been patched out for the Steam release (especially difficulty balancing in the last world).It's a great game that I totally recommend.

												Be warned that this is an early-2000s 3d platformer and it really shows- annoying collect-a-thons and all. A controller is recommended if you have access to one- the keyboard controls work but can be a little wonky at times. Some very difficult platforming throughout brings these niggles to light and can be frustrating.Where Psychonauts shines instead is in the hugely imaginative (literally!) world and cast of characters, who play the role of both plot progression and game world. Raz's psychic abilities allow him to enter the minds of those who let him in, in order to arrange their thoughts and solve their problems for them- learning their secrets in the meanwhile. Battle Napoleon in a giant game of Risk, help the Milkman defeat the evil girl scouts, and maybe even help Raz confront his childhood fears. Erik Wolpaw, who would later join Valve to write the Portal and Team Fortress series, lends his talents to these characters and ensures they'll leave a big impression on you. If you can forgive the difficulties with the gameplay, the humour on display here is wholly worth it.			",107,22,2,21,6,2,15

												First off I'm gonna tell you one thing, buy this game, and then I'll explain why you should. This game is absolutely fantastic. It's fun, it's got a great story, great characters, and hilarious (if not somewhat cheesy) dialogue.The story is quite interesting, but it's actually really enhanced by the characters. Double Fine did an excellent job of giving every single character (yes even the minor ones) a sense of actual human personality. A 10 year old boy who's running away from the circus to become a psychic agent, a sarcastic girl with the ability to talk to plants and takes no BS from anyone, a timid, socially awkward boy who was told to go to the camp because he kept blowing up people's heads with his mind, and a plethora more of quirky characters really make the game world and gameplay twice as fun and hilarious.However, another thing that Double Fine did that really gave the game some depth is the subtly. If you pay close attention to each character and their dialogue, memory vaults, and figments, you can find out some surprisingly....dark things about them. Even the main character, Razputin, mentions some pretty awful things that happened to him and his family as a child. But these little things add even more character to them, it makes them feel like they could be actual people because who hasn't had bad experiences or trauma in their lives? For a lot of the young campers, how they hint at these really tragic events is very child-like of them, like how an actual kid who can't quite comprehend those kinds of things would describe or talk about them.(You can see that I love the characters in this game right?)Moving on, the combat system is a boatload of fun, with cool abilities that are decently balanced with the gameplay. You can levitate and shoot psychic blasts of energy at your enemies, light almost every living thing on fire, and a bunch more cool things that are required to progress through different levels of the game. Speaking of the game levels, they're coloful and vary from each person's mind you enter, with different bosses and NPCs as well as the variety of different objects and missions that really tell you about the personality of the person's mentality.However, there does tend to be a bit of vagueness in certain levels where I'd get stuck because there was no clear objective or direction to what I was trying to do. At times it was more frustrating than other levels and if you've ever heard of the infamous last level of this game, the difficulty curve just spikes suddenly with how ridiculously hard and unforgiving it can be (and this version on Steam is the easier version of it!). But nonetheless, it kept me playing the game in a raging ""I'm going to beat this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level so help me"" kind of way.I will say if you're a person who goes for 100% completion or achievements, good luck to you. There's hundreds of these things in the game called figments (like figments of one's imagination) and in some levels they're placed in ridiculously hard to find places. I'm not a person who really cares for those things as much so it never bothered me, but I can definately see how it would irritate some people who either really hate collecting.But aside from those little nitpicks and some level frustrations, I absolutely adore this game (and am currently restarting it) and would reccommend it to as many people as possible so Double Fine can come out with a sequel for it already!

Short version: 88%The cute (but dated) puzzle platformer surface of Psychonauts hides a game teeming with ideas, imagination, and great design choices (plus a not too great control scheme). A game that is worthy of all the praises it got in the past years.Long version:When Tim Schafer started his own company, Double Fine, in 2001, he was mostly known as the somewhat eccentric designer behind the greatest LucasArts adventures. So when their first title, Psychonauts, was finally released in 2005, it was a surprise to see it commercially fail despite the great reviews.Although the game eventually gained the following it deserves, it is easy to understand the initial troubles: on the surface, it looks like a typical early 2000s 3D puzzle platformer with 90s kids’ movie stereotype characters drawn as Nickelodeon figures. It took years to finally understand that its greatness lies under the hood.For starters, there is the plot. Initially, it seems like a summer camp movie about kids who have psychic powers, but as the story goes on, we learn that this movie was apparently directed by Tim Burton, as it slowly turns into a (kid-friendly) nightmare world for our brave protagonist, the somewhat clichéd sassy tough kid Rasputin.This change in atmosphere is anything but subtle, as the game world moves from a somewhat serene campground to a creepy island asylum. Both of these serve mostly as an overworld that ties together the actual levels, all set in the mindscape, the psyche of certain characters.These levels are the main reason behind the late-coming success of Psychonauts. Each offers something brand new game mechanic, ranging from simple platforming to almost point ‘n’ click levels of story-driven puzzle solving. They delve deep in the minds of a character, utilising this to its full extent to tell us an interesting, often bittersweet tale, showing us the full capabilities of the storywriting strength Double Fine could deliver.

												A decent 3D platformer for children aged 1 to 92. Psychonaut's strength is its charm - you play as Raz, a psychocadet, training to be a psychonaut. Psychonauts travel through others minds - an inception-like endeavor - often helping the individual reach some closure. Adults will appreciate the intricacies - you collect mind fragments, clear mind webs, and open emotional baggage. Every mind/level is unique, a reflection of the individual's personality with each introducing interesting mechanics. Honestly, I feel like Psychonauts is an interesting piece which tries to illustrate the uniqueness of the mind. It tries to get us to take another's perspectives - to, like Raz, explore their mind.

												Psychonauts is a 3D action-platformer game originally released on Xbox and Windows in 2005. This game is probably one of the most creative and artful games ever made. In this game, you are a character named Razputin and you need to travel through people's brains in order to solve their problems and whatnot. Each brain (world) is completely different and can be pretty weird. A world takes 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete most of the time, more if you're wasting your time somewhere or trying to solve a puzzle (yes, there are a few puzzles, but they aren't very difficult and give you hints all the time). The game itself isn't super long, you can finish it within 20 hours, probably around 5 if you're replaying the game (it took me 17 hours). You also get upgrades in your journey which let you use special powers (levitation, shooting fire, etc.)This game is gold. It has great writing and some bizarre humour, excellent voice acting, beautiful environments, good character design, and an awesome soundtrack. On the negative side, the camera can get annoying sometimes and the story continuity kinda drops near the end of the game. Other than that, it's a game that you should definitely try (you can also get in on Xbox Live or the new Mac version) and that is worth every penny. I honestly wish this game got a sequel though. Awesome game, totally recommend to absolutely anyone.			",45,1,0,2,5,0,1

												This game was as good as I expected it to be. I had been hearing about it for a while, and since the sequel is coming out soon, I eventually bought it ($9.99 is a good price, but if you wait until there's a sale, it usually goes for $0.99!). It's really satisfying when you're looking for a solution to a certain puzzle and you suddenly realize ""Oh! It would make sense if I used this ability!"". Should you ever feel stumped on a problem, you could always ask Ford Cruller for advice by summoning him with bacon.The writing can be really humorous at times and all the characters are very interesting in both design and personality. Don't even get me started with the G-Men in ""The Milkman Conspiracy"", They're hands down the funniest part of the game.Overall, this game was a really enjoyable experience. I'll be looking forward to the sequel when it comes out. I'm excited for the possibilities of even crazier and stranger looking characters in the future.			",35,6,0,3,1,2,0

												Many people describe this game as a ""cult classic"", but that does a disservice to a broadly appealing game that does so much right. Psychonauts, nearly a dozen years after release, remains an engaging and entertaining action-adventure 3d platformer that remains one of the funniest video games available. The graphics, while far from impressive by today's standards, have aged well because they focus on expressiveness rather than realism. The platforming, likewise, while plagued by occasional camera-angle issues, is perfectly decent.But the reasons you should play this game are the laughs and the level design. The theme of a psychic who leaps into the minds of others for each level is quite inventive, and unlike most games with inventive themes, this one backs it up with inventive gameplay. From the clean and tidy cube in the mind of the secret agent, to the twisted logic-and-gravity-defying mind of the schizophrenic, to many other hilarious worlds I hesitate to spoil but which introduce new mechanics, each level in Psychonauts feels like its own little masterwork. These are not just the same levels with new skins, or new enemies, each level in this game FEELS very different, and over a decade later I've yet to see a game with better level design.This is one of the true classics -- not just cult classics -- of PC gaming, and anyone who hasn't played it should certainly consider grabbing it during one of those times when it's on sale for a buck, such as today.

												Psychonauts is a third person action platformer made by Double Fine Productions following the psychic adventures in a summer camp for psychics training to be spies, as well as uncovering a camp-wide conspiracy involving psychic tanks, maniacal dentists, T.V., and milk.When I first started playing Psychonauts I was a bit dubious. A game with a cult-status which is supposedly impossible to dislike because of how stylish and funny it is--or so I was told by the legions of the internet--with a witty and incredible world populated with fun memorable characters. And milk.And It's with a strange feeling that I tell you that it's all of those things and even more. A game that genuinely impressed me even while riding on the backs of glowing reviews and flowery retrospectives. A game that made me laugh so hard that I actually had to put down the controller in order to recollect myself. A game that made me hungry yet again for things like color and style in video games, for things like inventive level design and meaningful story/level interaction, for things like interesting puzzles and fleshed out platforming. For things like milk.Delicious milk.Ignore all the praise, and meet this game on it's own terms. It's a fully realized adventure with charm and fun that makes you feel emotions of almost every spectrum even in it's modest playtime but never sacrifices gameplay or entertainment to make it's point. To say no to such an experience is absoultely brainless.			",34,4,0,1,0,0,0

												Psychonauts truly surprised me.Having been recommended Psychonauts on a few occassions, I finally decided to give it a try. First off it has to be noted that the game is nearly a decade old, and one must remember that while dealing with the clunky graphics. But beyond that, the art style and general gameplay is wonderful. The game offers a classic platformer in a beautiful and unique visual style, that quickly goes from calm and peaceful to dark and gloomy. Initially the story starts off very much aimed towards children, but as the game progresses it becomes more about immaturity than childishness, and during certain parts of the game you might even find yourself wondering ""Who is this game actually geared towards?!"" (Spoilers: Madman stealing brains. Lots of kids burned to death. Suicidal/Sadistic/Murdering campmates. And more psychopathic nonsense.) The general story is humorous, surreal, cute, psychopathic, dark and immature, the tone of the game changes on a second's notice and takes you through dozens of surrealistic worlds, all with their unique charm and mood, much like the various characters you will meet throughout it. It is by far one of my all-time favorite Double-Fine games.			",1644,625,62,220,224,19,300

												Psychonauts is a high quality cult classic that I believe is still a beautiful game today. The characters are funny and the plotline features some bizarre plot twists that are rather enjoyable and will keep you hooked on the game! Most importantly, the setting of Psychonauts is very atmospheric and absorbing, pulling you into the vast landscapes of Whispering Rock's Psychic Summer camp to the depths of anonymous minds, beating down personal demons and obscure personas while doing so. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing and memorable.If you ever want take a break from the MMO world or simply sit down and relax with a quality, single-player adventure game, Psychonauts shouldn't be missed!

												I have grown weary of 3D Platformers.Over the years, I simply got bored of them.Have heard of Psychonauts before, but left it aside, assuming it was the same as the rest.Eyeballing it in my Games List, I decided to give it a shot.2 weeks later, I'm here, writing this review.Psychonauts essentially changes everything that a 3D Platform should be, then adds in several cups of the Schafer Salt for good measure.The game is easier to play now, thanks to the recently added (rudimentory, but sufficient) Xbox 360 controller support.But is it worth the asking price of US$10?Very Much yes. Even more so if its below the base price.I only disliked one level of the game, the very last level (from what I've read, I am not alone), yet the rest of the game I absolutely loved.The game does not end story-wise and so it is dependant on the sequel, which as of writing this it has not been release yet.In the Double Fine Catalog, Psychonauts is in the short list of favourite games from the Developer.

What a rush of nostalgia. Psychonauts brought me back to my childhood. To be more specific the  era where 3D plaformers (with RPG elements) became the norm for videogames. It is a refreshing, quirky, amusing, and very satisfying game overall. It also strengthens the argument that great graphics are not necessary for games to be great.Positive:- Creative, original story- Quirky art-style that perfectly fits the game- Great voice-acting- Controls are responsive and feel natural- Plenty of silly jokes- Many unique levels/worlds which force you to think differently- Fantastic difficulty curve - the game gradually expects more out of you- The game feels fair. If you die it was probably your own fault- Plenty of side quests and collectables (adds to replay value)- Levitation = wheeeeeeNegative:- As expected of most 3D plaformers: camera angles can sometimes be terrible- The mechanism for rail grinding can be awkward- There is a lot of information thrown your way when you begin. It can be overwhelming for new gamers- Not always clear what you are expected to do- Where is Psychonauts 2?!Conclusion:Well? What are you waiting for. This game is a must for anyone who has fond memories of fantastic 3D platformers. With such a low price tag there really are no excuses (especially when it goes on sale: only 1 euro!). If you are concerned about the graphics, don't be. You will have such a great time that it won't even matter. After a while you will grow to appreciate the art-style.			",191,40,3,20,12,2,11

												Psychonauts has some outdated game design decisions (we are all immensely bored of collect-all-the-things), but this does not take away from the sheer depth and beauty of it as a platformer and a universe.The game Psychonauts has an intense dedication in immersing you in summer camp for psychics universe. You feel like the other children have their own quests and goals and you see them taking classes with you. It's little details like this that make Psychonauts stand out from other platformers that put all their focus in level design, and the bare minimum in immersion. On top of that, I am very impressed at the overarching theme of exploring the ""typical mind fallacy"" and in how we tend to overlook the experience and stories of children and those of different cognitive experiences. Early in the game, a child will tell a story that both the player and the teachers conclude is ""just a story"". Later in the game this ""just a story"" becomes a clear story point. And Raz is a delightful protagonist. I've never seen a game explore anxiety in its general and social forms so effectively. (I related a bit too strongly to the under-water level.)Despite various outdated game design mechanics, Psychonauts is a classic which should be played by all future game designers if only to learn how important a dedication to world immersion is and how much more satisfying a game mechanic is when it's intimately linked to story and theme.

												This game is a lot of fun, and despite being nearly 10 years old, it still holds up really well and plays great. Most of the game is fun and not frustrating (except for the second to last section of the entire game, right before the final boss; try not to punch your screen there ;) ). This may look like a kids game and may even be meant to be a kids game, but I think anyone of any age who enjoys gaming will have fun with this. The only negatives are mainly due to its age: low resolution cut-scenes are ugly, yeah the graphics and character models are a bit blocky, the invisible walls you encounter don't seem to conform to the shape of the environment, etc. And that second to last bit of the final level just before the final boss will be an exercise in frustration and anger management. But really, none of these things are bad enough to be a dealbreaker in this game. Worth getting at its usual price; absolute no-brainer when on sale. :)			",379,74,10,28,16,1,21

												Very fun platformer!Graphics still hold up due to a cartoony look and every level is a different and fun experience. The writing is fantastic and has many laugh out loud moments. The game will keep you busy and interested for at least 10+ hours. My only gripes are the collecto-thon type gameplay did wear a little bit thin by the end. I have always been a big fan of games that have you collecting items, such as Banjo Kazooie, but collecting all of the items in this game is a chore, especially the holograms. Some items, such as the collectable brains, yield different story elements and are interesting. Completing the game will probably add on at least another 5-10 hours of gameplay, all be it repititive and mundane gameplay.TL;DR Very good writing and creative level. Collecting items grows repetitive, especially if trying to attain 100%. Very good game to pick up on sale.8/10			",91,8,2,4,6,1,4

												I had this in my library for over a year and a half before I finally finished it. I regret to not have done so much earlier, because this is truely an outstanding game. I'm really envious of the amount of creativity. There are so many details and humorous easter eggs. It's pretty lengthy as well. Much content. Lots of good!What makes this game special first and foremost is the jarring design - that makes the characters, the voices, the dialogue, the level architecture + gimmicks and naturally the humour. What I like about it is, that it takes itself serious enough to not become a total joke. It's not constantly funny and that's a good thing.I also like the structure and all the little conveniences. You have a Hub-world with multiple screens where you can free-roam to collect goodies. You have a transit system for fast travel and can get information at every moment so you never have to leave the game if you're stuck. The actual levels are in people's mind, and boy, did they make sure everyone feels unique. They are thinking out of the box more that in the box if you know what I mean. There is also a level select screen, the collective unconscious - another means to give you quick and easy control over where to go.Psychonauts is a blend of different genres. It's a 3D-Platformer but also an Action-Adventure game. These elements are served in rotation and there are long stretches where one of these takes a backseat. For example, sometimes you are significantly jumping around more and collecting stuff, Other times it's more about item management and problem solving and then there is straight-out combat. Very good pacing, both gameplay-wise and visually.And there is a lot to do... the feature list of the game mechanics are staggering. It could be tedious at some point or the other to collect all figments, say like 243 in a huge screen, but most of the time it feels very good to get everything. In some places it is a little glitchy and frustrating. You eventually get annoyed in your attempt to conquer all of it. Like, when you set the enemy on fire and he runs into you and passes in on, making you run around uncontrollably. Or when you can't get enough momentum to jump high enough off off a trampoline. Or when you're trapped in a tight space and jiggle around to get free. Yeah... be prepared for this. At that point you're probably willing to forgive more easily when the game has won you over.A little tip to prevent you from having the same start as me: As soon as you reach level 3 (from 10) you get a new mode of transport and that changes everything.Play with a gamepad!

												Psychonauts is easily one of the most unique games available. It's the right combination of quirk, sass, eye-candy, and humor bundled with phenomenal (while corny, in several respects) storytelling and a particular sense of fervor that's difficult to come by, pertaining to character development and sentimental value in the setting.Psychonauts is a game that you can forget the world with. Sit down, relax with a controller, and immerse yourself. Definitely recommended.			",20,2,0,2,1,0,0

The control is solid and working as intended, i have no problem with a x1 controller. The concept is wild & imaginative, dialogue is funning, and all sorts of other things.			",56,49,0,9,2,0,7

												It's incredible and marvelous Game! I own ""Psychonauts"" DVD-jewel with brilliant Russian localization from ""BUKA"" (it's official publisher in the Russian Federation). This title contains: elements of platformer & action-adventure, unique & uncomparable style, sea of glorious & elegant humor, many cool incornated psy-abilities. Don't be afraid cartoon graphic and usage theme of children's camp. Great humor is worth to play it. If you want to find a happy smile on your face, dive into the World of Psychonauts. This Game must necessarily be in the collection of everyone who considers himself a lover of extraordinary games. It's real father of indie for me! Heavy Indie :)			",201,66,5,22,5,2,30

												First time review, so here it goes:This is a great game. No caveats or buts; it is, without question, a masterpiece.The games is about a young boy named Raz, who ran away from the circus to a summer camp to become a Psychonaut.Once there he meets many quirky and colorful characters and enters their minds to fight their inner-demons, unpack their emotional baggage, and maybe learn to set things on fire.The main strength of this title comes from its focused design. All the pieces just fit well together. The level of minds you must face, the leveling system, the odd off the wall plot, the aft for mentioned cast of characters, the music choices, and the overall sense of the game. A mix of the seemingly familiar wrapped in the trapping of the strange.Some very minor nitpicks I feel I need to add. They are by no means game breakers. In fact I encourage you to go play this game before reading this list. The game doesn't tell you can interact with as many things as you actually can. For my second play through I was using the action button on everything and finding that there's always some throwaway line or gag for nearly every object or person. The figments (one of your main collectables) are the fiddliest things to get in every level. They can range from mildly annoying, frustrating (the race), to downright impossible (waterloo world). That wouldn't be so bad if there was a way you could track down the ones you missed (you always miss one, guaranteed). But if you really want 101% you need to use the internet to track down the missing ones (itself a pain in the butt). I honestly had no problem with the Meat Circus first or second time. (The first time I did have problems with (one of) the final boss, but that was performance issues with my PC and me not configuring it properly). [Pro-tip: ignore everything in the first tent and just save the little kid and get to the top. You can come back later]One last thing I want to really highlight, is the settings of the levels. Every one of which is exploding with a creativity rarely seen in any videogame. My favorite is a toss-up between Waterloo World and The Milkman Conspiracy. (Though Lungfishoppolis comes in a close third)In the end, this is only my opinion, not everyone’s. I mean, what do you care, this game is how old now and every person on the internet has given their opinion on everything. But hear me out, even as old as it is, it is still one of the greatest video games of all time. Period. The humor, the charm, it's all there for all to see and play. The sequel is apparently coming out soon, I don't know what to think about that, but if it is half as good as the original the gaming world on the whole will be better for it. Signing off in the words of Coach Oleander that I think sum up the game quite nicely- ""You shall engage the enemy in his own mentality! You shall chase his dreams! You shall fight his demons! You shall live his nightmares. And those of you who fight well, you will find yourselves on the path to becoming international secret agents — in other words... Psychonauts! The rest of you... will die!""			",242,114,2,16,16,2,21

												A crazy, creative, imaginative and fun game by the great Double Fine production company. Love the randomness of it at times and the world Double Fine created, full of humour, references, action and fun. Not too short to my taste and not too long, while some parts may seem repetitive it benefits from a rather unique humourous universe with a very fun gameplay which makes the overall gaming experience rather very positive, if you have nothing against platform games ^^. Great voice acting in French; should be equivalent in English :).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Psychonauts  8/10If you liked: Banjo Kazooie, Super Mario 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Earthworm Jim GameplayPros:-The abilities you acquire make platforming fun-Platforming isn't needlessly challenging besides the final level-Collecting certain items unlocks backstories of the game's characters, making the collect-a-thon fun-Rare to get stuck on a section thanks to in-game assistance.Cons: -The platforming is sort of floaty in the same vein as Banjo Kazooie. This personally doesn't bother me but I know for some platforming enthusiasts it's a problem. -The combat is rough, think Zelda z-targeting. However, it's fairly uncommon. -Some abilities aren't really useful outside of the area you unlock them in. Classic Zelda-itis. -Collect-a-thon's aren't for everybody. I didn't 100% the game. (yet?)Graphics:Pros: -Artstyle is clean and interesting-Most of the models still look nice for a PS2 era gameCons: -The game has obviously aged, it was released in 2005-The artstyle may not be for everybody. It's best described as ""grotesque."" Reminiscent of early 90s cartoons (Ahh! Real Monsters, Ren & Stimpy, etc.. Personally it took a few hours to grow on me, afterwards I'm fond of it.)Writing:Pros: -The writing is unexpectedly funny, don't miss the conversations with all the NPCs. This is really the main draw of the game. -All main characters have interesting/tragic backstories that flesh them out well-The game is a good length. I finished the story at 11 hours in. That'd probably stretch out to 15-16 hours with 100% completion. Cons: -The game is really slow at the start. The first 3 levels (comprising about 30% of the game) are tutorials. The first especially is really rough. Push through and the game finds its stride quickly. Technical Trouble/Misc:-The mouse/keyboard controls are truly terrible. Do yourself a favor and play with a controller. -The camera causes some problems towards the end-game-The game should run fine on any computer from this decade. However, evidently there are some issues with AMD cards where effects don't appear properly. -Buy the Dowsing Rod in the shop ASAP. It finds 40-50 arrowheads at a time instead of one. -This is a 3d platformer in the same vein as the games I mentioned at the outset. If you didn't like those, you probably won't like this. Overall, Psychonauts is a hilarious, silly game with solid platforming. Anyone who plays it is left with a charming, memorable experience. 8/10**If you like/love any of the games at the top of this review, pick this up ASAP** ",69,5,0,9,10,1,5

TL;DRBUY THIS GAME! If you have a controller, I'd recommend it over the keyboard and mouse as I've found it to be much easier to control Raz with a controller instead of the keyboard.Over a decade and the game still holds up.Psychonauts is truly a testament to great game design — released over a decade ago and still holds up well. The game features one of the most original stories this side of Spec Ops: The Line, and the humor is on-point though subtle. The characters are unique, and most importantly, human. Each one has their own problems, motivations and quirks. As the story progresses, you'll get to see characters' lives unfold, each one a different arc. I think the true achievement of Psychonaut's storytelling is that you, the protaganist, is never the main character of the story, but simply a conduit. Your actions move the story forward, but it's the lives of others that draw your attention and empathy.And my god, the level design. Instead of filling the game with gimmicky tricks that are used once (and never again, I'm looking at you Assassin's Creed, Bioshock, Dishonored, etc.), the levels in Psychonauts is designed in such a way that each ability will undoubtedly be used over and over again (except for Clairvoyence). The levels also do not feel repetitive. Even though the core mechanics never change from the first mission to the last, every mission has it's own little gimmick that makes that one particular level feel different than every other level.The soundtrack is on point, and even though the graphics undoubtedly feel a bit dated, when a game is this good, it doesn't really matter.

												One of my favorite games!  Great art, story and mechanics.  All aspects of the game have aged beautifully, and it looks better than ever.I've played it on the Playstation2, Xbox 360, and now on Steam with a synched controller.  Works great with the controller, but there are some minor issues navigating the options menu.  Easily solved if you have your keyboard handy.  The only problem I've found is that the game frequently crashing when loading levels from fast travel locations.  While inconvienent, the quick load times keep the delay to a minimum.This is the third time I've bought this game, and I'll do it again to put this on as many systems as I own.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most unique and hilarious platformers I have ever played, Psychonauts carries on the Double Fine legacy with near perfect form. The story of Raz and his adventure in a camp for psychics is both charming and at times extremely disturbing, but from beginning to end you can really tell just how much the writers poured their hearts into each and every line.The gameplay isn't as original, falling in line with most other platformers in terms of mechanics, though the controls do leave a bit to be desired. The levels on the other hand are some of the most bizarre and interesting I've seen in any game, a few harkening back to Double Fine's adventure game roots with some clever puzzles to mix things up.Everything is brought together with a fantastic art direction. If Tim Burton and Pixar had a lovechild, it would look like Psychonauts. The music is memorable, the voice acting top notch, and overall it is simply a marvelous game that I can recommend to any fan of Double Fine or just 3D platformers in general!

Can be childish at times, but it fits with the humor and juxtaposes well with some of the darker and more mature elements.- Great art direction, despite its age the graphics still don't look dated and fit with the look and feel of the game perfectly. The character design tends more towards cartoony characters whose appearance give you a good outline of their personality, and the environments vary widely from traditional platformer areas to mind bending levels that twist and turn through every axis.- Tight platformer mechanics, moving around and exploring the environments is easy and encouraged thanks to loads of hidden collectables. Its easy to keep track of your progress, and constantly unlocking something new, or being just about to, will keep you playing that one more level.The bad -- Occasional problems with the camera, the usual having to wrestle it under control from a preset position. Part and parcel of 3D platformers ported from consoles.- Some of the latter levels have some downright unfair sections with long runs between checkpoints and unforgiving level design that can become quite frustrating.- Optimization problems with Windows 7. There are loads of threads all over the net complaining of crashes and freeze-ups, which seem to only occur on Windows 7. True, running the game in compatibility mode (I used Windows 95) solves this issue but it seems like a glaring problem for a game on Steam, no matter how old.Personal Highlights (contains level spoilers, no storyline spoilers) -- Lungfishopolis - Destroying a city populated by fish as a giant Kaiju Theatre version of yourself. Complete with gameplay being interrupted by news flashes as the fish report on your rampage of destruction.- The Milkman Conspiracy - One of the most head bending levels I've seen in a platformer in recent times.- Razputin (the main character) is voiced brilliantly by Richard Horvitz (the voice of Invader Zim). YMMV on this one, but as a fan of the show I loved hearing the distinctive voice throughout.Summary -Won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if you like platformers and adventure games, Psychonauts is an excellent example of an original and unique take on the genre. It's fun to play, memorable in both its level design and its story, and, frankly, there's not much out there (especially recently) that compares to it. Let down by minor problems that plague many console to PC ports, but they don't hamper it enough to be a standout game.9/10Context - 9Challenge - 8Catharsis - 8			",153,59,2,27,20,1,29

												Wow! Where to begin, this game is just so incredible and so mind blowing that it's a real damn shame this is dubbed by many as ""the best game you never heard of"". This game is heavily underrated but yet it has a strong cult following. This is from the genius mind that brought us such great classics as the Monkey Island series and the ever popular PC hit Grim Fandango comes Tim Schafer's greatest creation since Brutal Legend, Psychonauts. This game has his style written all over it from the comedic story to the well balanced game play. It looks and sounds like something out of the mind of Tim Burton from the design to the music.Psychonauts is a single player experience with a well written story and tells it in a very comedic style that left me laughing throughout the entire game. You play a young boy named Raz who just arrived at camp for psychics and you experience the misadventures he goes through at his time there. Not one character is one dimensional and playing through this game you don't see that in other games. I really appreciated that and what they did with everything in the game. This is possibility the best platformer or let alone the best game I've ever had the pleasure of playing. In no way was the game hard nor was it a push over. It is well balanced and a great pick up for veteran gamers or new comers alike.I played this game on the original Xbox when it came out and playing it again reminded me how great this game is. This is my second time playing it and my first time playing it on PC. I have to say that the PC version of the game is much much better and it really shows. The graphics on it are much clearer and sharper than on console. And since this is the Steam version of the game, they added Achievements to boot. If you played it already on console, weither is was on the PS2 or Xbox, this is your second chance to play it all over again. My only gripe with the port is that the cut scenes were not optimized for PC, but that doesn't matter. It's a very good game and that is all that matters. :DI highly recommened this game for every gamer out there. This game is a solid 10/10			",1035,339,17,132,84,7,136

												One of the most unique and hilarious platformers I have ever played, Psychonauts carries on the Double Fine legacy with near perfect form. The story of Raz and his adventure in a camp for psychics is both charming and at times extremely disturbing, but from beginning to end you can really tell just how much the writers poured their hearts into each and every line.The gameplay isn't as original, falling in line with most other platformers in terms of mechanics, though the controls do leave a bit to be desired. The levels on the other hand are some of the most bizarre and interesting I've seen in any game, a few harkening back to Double Fine's adventure game roots with some clever puzzles to mix things up.Everything is brought together with a fantastic art direction. If Tim Burton and Pixar had a lovechild, it would look like Psychonauts. The music is memorable, the voice acting top notch, and overall it is simply a marvelous game that I can recommend to any fan of Double Fine or just 3D platformers in general!

												This is Tim Schafers masterpiece, no other platformers have yet surpassed this amazing game after so much years (except maybe the recently announced psychonauts 2 WOOO). The graphics still hold up to this day, the comedy is gold and the main character is very likeable. All the characters you meet have distinct and great personalities (especially the ones in the asylum)Want a game where you're a giant monster terrorizing a city and leading a resistance to its fearsome leader? Want a game where you're staging a play and trying to catch a mysterious masked villain who is terrorizing it? Want a game where you're uncovering a conspiracy in the weirdest neighborhood you've ever seen? It's all here.If you haven't played this game yet then what are you doing with your life?

												This is probably the textbook definition of a ""hidden gem."" In terms of story and atmosphere, the game has a level of demented charm that you really don't see a lot of any more in games, movies, or cartoons nowadays. Most of the time I found myself grinning or even laughing at some of the things the characters said. Every environment is filled with personality. Thinking about it now, the level of character that the developers have put into the game reminds me of games like Earthbound.In terms of gameplay, it's a solid 3d platformer. At first you may think that it's just another platformer, which in itself isn't a bad thing, but at the same time maybe you were wanting more. I promise, if you stick with the game, it becomes a different beast with the more psychic powers you obtain. I recommend a controller for the game, but it's still playable with a keyboard and mouse. Overall, it's a fantastic game. Aside from the short length of the game and a few audio and graphical hiccups here and there, I didn't have that many issues with it, and it's definitely worth the $10 price.			",27,3,0,3,1,0,2

												As far as gameplay is concerned, Psychonauts certainly wears its age: a lot of the mechanics feel truly dated by now.  Despite that, though, it's still one of the funniest games out there.  It's great fun, and well deserving of its loyal fanbase.  Give it a shot.			",131,40,1,18,10,0,32

												I recommend this game tentatively. Pros: - Beautiful and Unique Art Style. It reminds me a bit of Invader Zim, but not so much so that I'd declare it a plain rip off. - Intricate and Masterful storytelling. The plot is interesting and keeps me coming back for more. I'm never just slogging through something hoping for a payoff. It's all a genuinely fun story.- Likable characters. Even the characters who barely get screen time or have no lines seem to be overflowing with personality. They feel very real, despite being so stylized. - Fun game mechanics. The psychic abilities are endlessly fun. Levitation is my absolute favorite, mainly because it frees up the movement of your character a lot, but there are several other abilities I really love. On top of being fun, they're necessary. Once a mechanic is introduced, they always give you a reason to use it. While you may eventually stop using it as often, it'll always come back a few more times.- Dialogue is witty and hilarious. It's not forced comedy like I see a lot of comedy games try to do. It's just funny, in a really natural way, and I found myself actually laughing out loud. Even jokes that fall flat were meant to do so, because the fact that the joke wasn't funny is part of the joke itself.- The vaults are probably my favorite part of the game. They're a sort of slide show deal, and there are usually two in every level. They're in depth explanations of certain points of that character's life, and they're a joy every time. - Bosses are challenging, but not impossible. They're all unique and just so fun. Cons: - The technology is from the PS2 era, and it shows. Some of the graphics are painfully outdated, and the pitful camera movement is a relic. You have to control the camera movement separately with your mouse, and it can tend to get frustrating during intense fights, trying to control the camera, move your character and target enemies. - Strange difficulty curve. The entire first section of the game is tutorials (understandably, considering the huge assortment of psychic abilities and mechanics they're trying to introduce) and at some point in the second half it suddenly jumps up to being extremely hard. I had to resort to a few lets plays at some parts because it was just so obtuse what you were supposed to be doing.- Figments and arrowheads were ridiculously annoying. Figments are somewhat transparent, so they tend to blend into the highly stylized backgrounds, making it almost impossible to know where they are at times. As for the arrowheads, they're practically everywhere, but at times the game demands you actively dig them up which just wasn't fun at all.- CRASHING. Good god, the crashing. At time of writing, the game has crashed at least 4 or 5 times today, which is why I'm writing this review now, hoping if I let it throw it's little tantrum for about half an hour it'll decide to work so I can continue playing. Perhaps it's just the computer I'm running it on (It's not really a gaming PC, but it is a high powered Mac) but it takes something away from the game when I'm saving every two steps in case the game decides to suddenly freeze and crash. Overall, I recommend it to anyone who wants to try something entirely new and different. It's a purely fun experience with a few technical issues that tend to drag it down at points. Despite the crashing and a few nit picky issues, I will continue playing it because I'm so invested, but if you don't think you could handle that, or don't have the patience for such a thing, I'd only recommend buying it on sale.

												This game....its just a classic. I had to finish it twice and get most achivements before i wrote this. The game is fantastic its a true gem. It has a wierd and witty story about ""psychic"" students in a school...well more like camp. Its an action, platfromer and definitely an adventure game with great amazing graphics for its time, as well as having a slight Tim Burton look. The gameplay is also perfect and no problems with the ui as well as abilities and wepons. I enjoyed the game very much with a keybord and mouse and its very obvious it was made for a ps2 so a controler is welcome too. Now with it coming to PS4 this game should be played by anone wanting a game to laugh about, with its witty comedy and fun characters this game shouldnt be missed. Loved this game till then end and litterally played nothing else till i finished it. A well deserved 10/10!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts is one of those games that you overlook because of it's age. I heard nothing but good things about it but I still was not convinced. One day I decided, why not? and I never looked back... ok I looked back like 30 hours later and a few times inbetween asking myself what I'm doing with my life but that's not relevant to this review. So first off, this is a 3d action-adventure platformer with a light, fun and whacky art direction, everything about this game gives of a facade of humorus dialogue and ridiculous characters, but the underlying tale has a much darker theme going, telling the sad story of dissapointment and faliure, manifesting in insane and unstable human-beings given the shortest straw in life, this is a story about untangeling and getting to the core issue of one's mind and finding ways to overcome those issues.This game shows empathy and heart, it's funny, selfaware and it feels like every nook and crany in this game holds some sort of meaning, it's packed with collectibles and there is always something to do, I pretty much binged this game untill I had collected everything, not something I normally find compelling but this game somehow manages to keep my monkey-mind on track and for that it's easily one of the best games I've played so far, can't wait for the second Psychonauts.

												One of my personal favourite 3D platformers! It's got sweet as powers, from running around on a levitation ball, to picking objects up with telekinesis, or even shooting psychic energy! The levels are all different and fun. Each world is based on a certain person and their ""issues and/or problems"" which ends up creating some of the most unique and various worlds that I have seen in a game. The characters in the game are also very unique and interesting too, it's a really hilarious game but at the same time, it can be very very dark. It's a really neat combination. The entire game is just filled with craziness and uniqueness. If you're a fan of 3D platformers, I defintely recommend checking this game out!			",204,22,1,24,7,3,8

												This game is one hell of a trip.Like, it starts off decently normal, where you're in a strange world, at a camp. And you think to yourself, ""Huh, well this is an interesting game, sort of weird but oddly addicting too."" You expect it to be like other games that you have played. Then all of a sudden, as you continue playing, it just gets weirder and weirder, until you finally except that either you, the game, or both are insane somehow.You delve into the mind of multiple characters, learning about them, and conquering their fears or ""inner demons"", freeing them from a bigger problem.And along the way, you grow pretty attached to the main character of the story. And at the end you just sit back, staring at the main menu of the game, silently saying to yourself, ""What the hell just happened?""11/10 would play again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game with a incredibly unique concept on the platforming genre, Psychonauts is probably one of my new favorite platformers ever. You take the place of Rasputin (which I hoped was going to be the russian leader, but whatever) who has a mysterious past that I will not spoil, as you learn about it as you go on. You end up into a camp for ""psychics,"" and unlike the other psychics, these guys are the real deal. You battle enemies by not just fighting them up front, but by going into their mind and fighting their demons. I can't wait to play more, as even the tutorial level is genius, with a general with a mind full of a whole boot camp. I never did play this game when it was released, but these graphics are still hold up very well, and the voice acting is amazing, especially the general of the camp. The only voice that was a little annoying was Rasputin's, but that might just be a personal preference. The gameplay is fun, and made me wanted to explore around the world the most I could to collect arrowheads, almost like a Banjo Kazooie game. In fact, the entire game reminds me of a remix on Banjo Kazooie, which, now that I think about it, is genius.All in all: with the sale for it being only 2 dollars, it is an absolute buy.Rating: 9.7/10			",67,16,0,9,11,4,6

												Do you remember that feeling of mystery and adventure that hit you back in the days, when you took up a new game? I mean those almost new 3D adventure games with sharp shapes, a mind blowing story and infinite secrets. Oh my, how I miss those games. The were the first I played with on console and PC, and they still hold a special place in my memories. They had always original ideas, not like some everlasting sequence of sequels of today; and nobody explained to you anything (except for a basic commands tutorial), you had to figure out everything by yourself, with curiosity and intelligence, and this made the winning so satisfying. And why am I acting like an old nostalgic gamer? Because Psychonauts is such a game, and I waited way too much to play it. It showed me how much games have changed over the years, for the best and for the worst, and how much we can learn from the masterpieces of the past to craft majestic titles in our future.Now, at the end of this (first) adventure in the Psyconauts Summer Camp, I am sincerely moved, by a game that reminded me why I started to play videogames when I was a boy, and why I still play them as a man.Vi ricordate  quella sensazione di mistero e aventura che vi prendeva quando iniziavate un nuovo gioco anni fa? Mi riferisco a quei giochi di avventura in 3D, ai tempi praticamente nuovi,  con le forme aguzze, una storia incredibile e segreti infiniti. Dio, quanto mi mancano quei giochi. Sono stati i primi a cui ho giocato su console e su pc, e occupano ancora oggi un posto speciale nei miei ricordi. Avevano sempre idee originali, non come certe infinite serie di sequel di oggi; e nessuno ti spiegava nulla (se non per un tutorial sui comandi base), dovevi capire tutto da solo, con curiosità e intelligenza, e questo rendeva la vittoria molto più soddisfacente.E perché mi sto comportando come un nostalgico vecchio gamer? Perchè Psychonauts è un gioco come quelli, e ho aspettato decisamente troppo per  giocarci. Mi ha mostrato quanto i videogiochi siano cambiati in questi anni, per in meglio e in peggio, e quanto possiamo imparare dai capolavori del passato per creare titoli meravigliosi in futuro.Ora, alla fine di questa (prima) avventura al Campo Estivo per Psychonauts, sono sinceramente commosso, da un gioco che mi ha ricordato perché ho iniziato a giocare ai videogiochi da bambino, e perché ci gioco ancora da adulto.

												Psychonauts doesn't reinvent the platformer, but it still delivers an experience that feels wholly original in every aspect of its execution.Psychonauts is a quirky, offbeat game set in a special summer camp for clairvoyant kids, in which a group of psychic children end up in a wacky adventure filled with brain-stealing hijinks, psychic secret agents, and a little romance on top of everything else. It's rooted in the sorts of 3D platforming sensibilities we've all come to know over the years. But there's a SPIN to the game--its psychic theme--which adds some cool puzzle-solving to the usual platform-jumping and swinging associated with the genre. Psychonauts also bears the unmistakable mark of designer Tim Schafer (known for classic adventure games Grim Fandango, Full Throttle, and Day of the Tentacle), thanks to a hilarious array of peculiar characters and a story that never fails to entertain. Psychonauts doesn't reinvent the platformer, but it still delivers an experience that feels wholly original in every aspect of its execution.It took four years and two publishers, but Psychonauts is finally here, and no worse for the wear, it seems.The heart and soul of Psychonauts is Razputin--or, Raz, for short--a big-headed, goggle-sporting psychic prodigy who sneaks his way into a mysterious summer camp that happens to be a training ground for the titular psychonauts, a group of psychic secret agents. Raz, it seems, has run away from his home in the circus and wants to become a psychonaut himself. Grudgingly, the counselors of the camp accept Raz into the group (albeit only for a day, until his father can come get him and take him home). However, it doesn't take long for strange things to start happening around camp. Raz, as well as other children, find that they're suffering from similar nightmares. Strange psychic interference seems to be POPPING UP all over the place, and not long after that, the brains of the other campers start disappearing, leaving the campers as soulless, TV-obsessed husks. As the hero of the story, Raz is on a mission to solve these various mysteries and uncover the crazy conspiracy behind it all.The basic plot itself reads like typical platformer fodder, but there's a lot more to Psychonauts' story than can be summed up in a single paragraph. This is largely due to the game's bizarre cast of characters, of which there are many. Raz himself is a highly likable hero; he's cute, heroic, funny, and also a little awkward at times. He fits the bill of the overenthusiastic yet not-quite-ready hero to the letter and it's hard not to feel sympathetic to his plight. But beyond Raz, there's a great supporting cast, with roughly two dozen other characters who play parts both large and small in the story. The counselors consist of Coach Oleander, an overly aggressive drill sergeant; Milla Vodello, a somewhat ditzy and party-happy go-go girl; Agent Nein, a pale-skinned, sweater-sporting scientist of indeterminate Eastern European origin; and Ford Cruller, a mysterious old man who seems to exist in about eight different places at once. These counselors join the crazy array of campers, as well as other strange people and creatures you'll encounter, to drive the storyline, and thanks to the game's excellent design, you'll have no shortage of opportunities to get ATTACHED to them.Initially, Psychonauts feels like a very open-ended game, especially because upon your first venture into the camp area, you'll find yourself able to just wander around, chatting it up with other campers or even just listening in on their completely INSANE conversations. The camp and its many areas make up a hub world, where you can access lots of different things, including a camp store, where you can buy helpful items, an underground tram that cuts down on backtracking, and all sorts of little hidden areas that yield bonus items. However, the biggest boon for the camp world is all the little bouts of dialogue you can discover. Depending on what stage of the game you're at, the conversations change up quite a bit, meaning you're not often going to hear a lot of repeats. This is great, especially because there's just so much of the dialogue. In some instances, you can literally just stand next to a pair of characters while they converse for about five minutes or longer and never hear the same line twice. And it's almost always really funny stuff.However, the most interesting aspects of Psychonauts' characters don't come from their real-world conversations, but rather from their internal monologue. As Psychonauts revolves around a bunch of psychics, the bulk of your time will be spent traversing the perils of people's minds. This is where Psychonauts truly shines. You'll be able to enter the minds of more than a dozen different characters in the game, and each mind serves as one of its main levels. Each level is completely unique. For instance, when you enter the head of Coach Oleander, you'll find a war-torn landscape filled with constant explosions, plants made out of ammunition, and, for reasons not immediately apparent, lots and lots of meat. In another example, you enter the mind of a crazed security guard named Boyd Cooper, who is utterly obsessed with nonsensical conspiracies and someone called ""The Milkman."" His mental landscape looks like a 1950s-era suburban neighborhood that's been picked up by a pair of hands, twisted into a topsy-turvy fun house, and occupied exclusively by shadowy agents in TRENCH COATS who try to convince you that they're just simple street workers, or hedge trimmers, or grieving widows, despite their obviously ulterior motives. It's all totally weird, but also undeniably unique.No two minds are exactly alike in Psychonauts, both aesthetically and in terms of gameplay. Granted, you will be spending at least some of YOUR time in each level engaging in the usual platforming shenanigans, like jumping and double-jumping over platforms, swinging from poles, walking tightropes, and so on. When the game is in full-on platformer mode, it plays very well. The controls are tight, the camera is rarely ever a problem, and it's generally pretty easy to get Raz around without screwing up, at least on the Xbox. The PC version controls well enough too, provided of course you have a good USB controller, as the keyboard and mouse controls just don't feel right for this type of game (and even with a USB controller, camera control can be a bit of a pain). If there's any one criticism to be mounted here across both platforms, it's that the game is rarely ever that difficult, save for a few specific parts that are actually quite tough. You can't call the game a total breeze, either, but most experienced players shouldn't have any problems mastering the basic play mechanics pretty quickly.The inside of a person's mind can be a pretty crazy place.Even though the game isn't particularly hard, at least it's not repetitive. The goals and challenges of each level are totally exclusive. In one level, you'll find yourself playing a bizarre board game against a mental projection of Napoleon Bonaparte. You'll shrink down to ""fun size"" to recruit new pieces to YOUR cause, and then you'll return to your normal size so that you can move them around. In another level, you're fighting neon-tinted luchadores and a big, hulking bull in what looks like a velvet painting of a congested Spanish city. It's with this kind of variety that Psychonauts manages to achieve its high level of quality.It also helps that the game has more to it than just a lot of jumping around. There are puzzles to be solved in Psychonauts, as well as battles to be fought, and both require use of Raz's list of crazy psychic powers. You start out only with a basic melee attack at your disposal, but as you play and collect items scattered about both the real world and mental worlds, you'll be able to upgrade Raz's rank and earn new powers, like telekinesis. 84/100			",189,44,1,46,12,1,12

												This sure is a great game, one of the lastest masterpieces coming from Tim Schafer.It's really sad it's really underrated in some points or in general.Why is this so great, you say? (or not, i'm going to say it anyways), it's totally fun, and really really creative, its fun to play and to progress, funny dialogues, bizarre moments and characters, sometimes you'll get some sad backstory coming from every character.Also, to keep in mind this: It's not a kids game. Neither +5, neither +10 or +13, despite the art, it has a lot of humour and dialogues that can be only taken serious or get a pun from the game if you're Teen/Adult, sure, a kid can play the game, but only to play, and follow some cliché things from every story of this kind.Now like every game, there is no perfection whatsoever. By this i mean, there are some bugs or mechanisms that are quite annoying in some point in the gameplay, sometimes you'll fall down, sometimes you won't grab a ledge, usually you'll touch A LOT of invisible walls, and there are some puzzles that are quite overthinked, or the only way to get the puzzle right it's going with the trial-n-error method, WHICH can take a lot of time and it will turn to be a bit boring, but once you get that right you'll feel really good.Characters are sure as hell NOT forgettable, they are distinguishable and special, really creative ways to play and make a nice but simple plot.In terms of port, you'll suffer some FPS drops in the mean time but they are really random, unless, of course, you use a FPS-locker program, because it lacks of FPS lock, so you will probably get 40 fps and then 80 fps but then 20 fps.Also, one more thing, it also lacks of controller support, but thanks to the internet, you'll get that done boy, with this guide

												If you haven't played this game, drop everything you're doing and go buy it. I'm serious, I don't care if you're heling your wife through labor or performin CPR, this game is far more important. I guarantee you'll like it for it's story if not the gameplay. And even then it has it's own unique artstyle that really catches your eye and refuses to let you go. Also, it's a game by double fine, and you just can't go wrong with those guys.If this review has not convinced you to buy this game, I will come to your house and stare at you until you go buy this game. I'm very good at staring threateningly at people.			",133,31,0,15,14,2,7

												With the new Psychonauts game on the way, I felt I needed to make a review for the first one. Let me start off by saying that if you have not already played this game, you are missing out. It is an absolute classic from one of my favorite developers, Double Fine. (And the man behind it all: Tim Schafer)The game itself is filled with great humor, amazing level design, eccentric characters, a villain's ridiculous plot to take over the world, and a mysterious milkman. (Play the game to see what I am talking about) The creativity of the developers is astounding and I found myself actually wanting to come back to all the levels to collect every little thing the developers put in there. All the levels have their own charm to them and the premise of the game really allows for some of the most memorable levels I have ever had the joy to play through. And honestly, I am extremely excited now that we are finally going to get a continuation of the story in the new game they are developing. I really hope it will be good, but even if it isn't, I still think people should pick this game up and play through it. In my opinion, it is well worth the $10 asking price, but if you still don't want to pay that much, then make a note to pick it up during a sale. Pros- Great Characters- Humorous story- Amazing levels- Interesting premise- Psychic Powers- MilkmanCons- Collecting all the figments can be annoying sometimes. (Only a problem for completionists)- Some minor bugs- It ends. :(Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's worth the price and Double Fine really produced a great game. Personal Score: 9/10			",208,42,0,15,10,2,20

												Double Fine make some really good games, this being one of the best in my opinion, the trailer for this game really doesn’t do it justice and I’ve noticed that in a few double fine games to be honest. They don't usually show off the game for what it really is, nor show its true potential. Just from the trailer, I didn't think this was something I would ever play, but I got it in a bundle and it’s actually an amazing game.Like any good game, some parts can be frustrating, but it’s all part of the fun. Because it wasn’t the kind of frustration for me that made me want to give up, more so the kind you want to keep trying again, and then when you do succeed, you feel like you've accomplished something. The story is quite quirky and fun, the dialog can be really humorous at times as well, at least to me. You can definitely tell the creative team of double fine are behind it, there is fun characters to interact with and fun little stories to unfold behind each one. Also, there is a lot of collectables and little Easter eggs to find in the game. It’s not one of those games that it seems like a chore to do, for me it was actually fun. But then again, I do like my collectables in games.All in all, I think it’s an amazing game, it’s definitely worth buying, if I didn't get it in a bundle, I would very happily of spent the money on it knowing now how good it is. I even liked it so much as to go back after my first play through and complete it 100%, achievements and all. Which took around 2 and a half playthroughs, it was a lot of fun. Even though I’ve finished it, I can still see myself going back and playing it again in the future. It’s a very enjoyable game, and I’m glad that I did end up playing it, despite what the trailer made me originally think.			",412,272,31,20,31,5,36

												Such an imaginative concept that's explored so well. A lot of variety in the gameplay, with radically different scenarios and many powers and types of movements you can use. Hilarious dialogue, charming characters, so much attention to detail (every NPC has dozens and sometimes hundreds of responses and the artistry of some of the locations is astonishing), and lots of collectibles which you are well rewarded for. Clearly made with a lot of love, and you'll fall in love with it too.Runs well even on an old PC. There are a few moments where the platforming can get tricky, but the whole game can be done even on a keyboard. Even if you don't care for platformers, make an exception for this one, because this game gives you so much.			",34,75,0,4,6,1,3

Overall this game is a cult-classic and a great hidden gem to play i rate this game 9/10 because the mechanics seemed like they could have been a little more refined and I didnt like the point of no return stuff but maybe thats just me.

												This is what I think can be called a modern day classic game. The world the game creates feels like something that they really put a lot of thought into with characters that absolutely fit in and interact in charming and very interesting ways. When I remember this game, I remember it in the same way I do a good movie or book. It has that strong of a unifying theme and directed narrative experience, except you can actually play it. The gameplay and mechanics are some of the least memorable parts of this to me because they just feel so natural to the story they're going for. And I think of that as a good thing.

												There's a reason why Psychonauts is in my top 10 favorite games of all timePositives-Unique presentation-Fantastic controls-Brilliant level design -Well written characters, I only wish some were given more spotlight, like Boyd Cooper and Sasha Nine.-An engaging storyNegitives-There was a lot of noticeable pace breaks during a play though,  namely when you get to the Insane Asylum and you have to go though 4 different minds without any real story going on. Also when you are in Rasputin's mind and you have to go to the top of the tower and then all of a sudin you need to get your levitation power.-Near the end of the game, there's no way to go back to the hub world, so if you wanted to go back and get everything to get rank 101, you'll have to start the game all over again.Overall Psychonauts is a fantastic game 9.5/10			",82,7,2,1,1,0,6

Definitely very unique in its story and characters, lot of fun to just explore and get immersed in. Double Fine did a damn good job putting together a great game.

												Psychonauts is honestly my favorite game - you really can't find games like this anymore. The humor is woven into the game, the characters are so intricate and likeable, and the story is entirely it's own and executed so well. The worlds you explore in this game are all so distinctly their own and creatively made. You can tell that lots of love and work got put into this project, and it has that 2000's feel that gets the nostalgia going. I will admit that at times the controls and camera can be more of a frustration than a feature, but for most of the game they work just fine. Achievement hunters should go into the game wary, as finding every figment is beyong annoying and the only aspect of this game that has ever actually frustrated me. If you can get past those couple little things, though, this game is so genuine and not afraid to be itself that it's well worth the time and money.			",45,36,0,12,12,0,2

												It has action, humor, and an enthralling story. It's an adventure game like no other featuring children soldiers. It's none other than Psychonauts. You play as Razputin, or Raz for short, who has a dream to become a Psychonaut, a psychic soldier who protects to the world,  before his parents can pick him up from Psychonaut training camp. As he ventures through the camp grounds completing task for his councilors, he stumbles upon something that could mean the end of the world. Through many obstacles and enemies, you must find a way to stop this calamity from happening all before you are picked up from camp. A game of this stature deserves much more praise than what it has received. Tim Schafer did an excellent job on creating a spell bounding game that captures your interest within seconds. A cult-classic in gaming that needs to be played.			",371,58,4,49,2,1,15

												I'm just gonna go ahead and call this game a ""classic"", ""must-play"".So, the idea is your character has different 'psychic' powers. The most basic one is double-jumping, and you gradually learn many other ones (some examples are shooting, moving stuff with your mind, burning stuff, seeing things how others' see them). They are complemented with various items, gadgets. All these are used in battle, but, more importantly, for solving puzzles, which will surprise you with their originality. If you pay attention, you will notice hints subtly hidden in what the characters say. And if you need more help, you can always call your scizophrenic mentor using a piece of bacon... yeah.There is also a lot of acrobatics involved. Jumping, floating, various interactions with platforms, poles, ropes, ledges, etc.A lot of stuff is frankly weird (and may creep you out if you're very sensitive), because often the action takes place inside other characters' imagination (many of them crazy, like in the asylum where you help the patients overcome their problems). Sometimes space/gravity is bent, which is also a nice addition to gameplay.All the levels are different and unique in some way.The story takes about 15 hours. And that's the minimal amount of time you will need to complete it (at least if you're not intentionally going as quick as possible). There is tons of content. Because there is a concept similar to ""experience"" and ""levels"" (which only let you unlock more powers - nothing like the usual RPGs), you can go at your own pace and complete as many side quests (which are usually tied to exploration of the game world) as you want. There is almost no grinding involved.★★★★★★★★★☆			",494,155,6,13,31,6,55

												One of my favorite games of all-time, and definitely my favorite Double Fine game. Psychonauts is a bundle of joy and love.There is nothing I dislike about this game, at all. I used to play a lot of funny platforming game years and years ago, but don't as much now. I loved playing things like Crash Bandicoot or, going back further generations, to things like Earthworm Jim. When it comes to weird humor though, Psychonauts is probably the top.The story of Psychonauts starts out simple but gets significantly more involved as it goes along, getting decently complex as things actually become a mystery. But the way of solving the puzzles is the best. Delving into the minds of different characters along the way, using their thoughts as levels, is awesome. Each stage in the game is so unique and interesting that I will replay them all forever. All of the characters are so interesting and have their own ticks, and the graphics and sounds (including voice acting) are so well-done. Nothing is wrong at all with the design.Raz, your character, gets interesting power-ups along the way, making exploration fun and opening up random puzzles. Finding the easter eggs in the levels is fun, from the basic collectibles (enabling you to buy upgrades) to especially the memories. The most stand-out ones for me are in Milla's mind, but just about all of them are rewarding in some way.The platforming itself is clean and not too frustrating, though some levels take a bit of adjusting to, such as the angles in the Milkman stage. And exploring outside of the levels is just as fun because Double Fine developed the world with lots of detail. Wandering around and finding some little incidental cutscene is great, especially since nearly everything in the game is really funny and off-the-wall.If you don't find the game's sense of humor enjoyable, then that's a shame. But I have to say that this game is one of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had. Go play it, now!			",159,61,0,14,6,1,6

												Ever dreamed of being a psychic soldier?! Of course you haven't, because that'd make you crazy, considering they don't exist. On the other hand, if you've ever wanted to play as a psychic soldier, Psychonauts is just for you. Don't look at the night sky, though.			",366,82,7,47,31,2,41

												I played ""Psychonauts"" only now, 10 years after it's been released. And the game holds up very well.This game is a third-person action/platformer with a very strong storyline. You are a boy who wants to become a psychonaut, a secret agent, who has powerfull psychic abilities and can get into the minds of other beings. At the beginning you can't do much, but throughout the game you will become more and more skilled.The graphics is very good and doesn't look old at all. I love the design of levels and characters: very colorful and cartoony.The controls are pretty comfortable. Platformer part of the game is well made. It's satisfying to even just jump around, exploring the world, gathering figments and arrowheads, finding secret bonuses.The game is greatly varied and doesn't let you become bored. All 15 hours that I played, I faced new challenges, interesting plot turns and memorable characters.			",52,17,0,2,5,0,2

												TL;DR: A great story with good gameplay. I recommend you play it, but SPECIFICALLY on Windows, with an Xbox 360 Controller, and with the Psychopad mod.Psychonauts was the first game that I ever bought (with money) on my Steam account. After hearing good reviews (such as the one from Yahtzee on Zero Punctuation), I had decided to pick it up. In the end, I'd consider it one of my favorite games of all time.The core gameplay actually feels a lot like a 3D Mario game. It's a 3rd Person 3D Platformer with some fairly intricate platforming. This difficulty is a little on the tough side, but it never really feels vicious other than the last level of the game. The game gives you a double jump from the beginning of the game, which makes the platforming a bit easier, and about a third of the way through the game, it gives you an ability that allows you to fall slower, which makes some of the later-game platforming more bearable. Your main attack is a punch that has a fairly large range. You also gain abilities as you progress though the game that allow you to attack from more of a distance. For these abilities, the game gives you a lock-on system that is very similar to Zelda's Z-Targeting. This usually works well, but can get frustrating at times when there are a lot of enemies on the screen at once.The level design in this game is excellent. The story behind the levels is that you are entering the minds of different characters, so each level is designed to represent that character's psyche. Because all of the characters you enter the minds of are well characterized, each level is itself a strong representation of the characters. The most interesting levels are correlated to the most interesting characters, with Boyd's level being particularly famous. There are hidden memory vaults, along with scripted events and cutscenes in the levels that help to further characterize the people who's minds you enter, helping to create a better overall connection between the levels you play in and the story that moves the game along.The story in the game is fantastic. You play a psychic boy named Raz who runs away from home (which happens to be a circus), to sneak into a summer camp that trains psychic kids to try to make them ""psychic secret agents"" called psychonauts. He discovers a conspiracy that threatens the entire camp, and it's up to Raz to save the camp. All the characters that you meet in the game are all well characterized, and makes the story much more interesting. The game has a lot of humor in it, and Double Fine has done a good job of making sure the jokes actually work. Psychonauts is one of the funniest games I've ever played.One aspect of the game that I didn't really like was the leveling system. There are a number of collectables scattered throughout the game (both in the levels and the overworked) that increase your level, and leveling up gives you a few required abilities (for the first few level tiers), then upgrades your existing abilities. Some of these upgrades actually makes the game a LOT easier, meaning that if you don't go out of your way to find these collectables, the game can be much more difficult. However, replaying the game to get 100% of the collectables is a lot of fun. Once you complete the story once, it's a lot of fun to restart the game and aim to get 100% of the collectables and achievements.This game can be downloaded for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, but the later two ports are actually pretty broken. I played the Mac version first, and I experienced serious performance issues, multiple graphics issues, and crashes. From what I've heard, the linux version doesn't fair much better than the Mac version. While the Windows version isn't perfect, it is certainly better than the other two. You can try to get it to run under Wine, but I can't make any promises about how well that will work.The keyboard+mouse controls for this game really suck. The game was designed around a controller, so you should play it with one. I recommend the 360 controller because the game has controller mapping and vibration support for it. If you have a wireless 360 controller already, just get a cheap Chinese knock-off of the wireless receiver (I can find them for around $10 USD) and force Windows to use the official drivers for it in the Device Manager. The game won't have the button prompts for the controller unless you use the Psychopad mod to add them. Be sure to turn off Steam Cloud Sync before running the patcher though, or the controls may be remapped in such a way to prevent the button prompts from appearing.In the end, I'd recommend this game. I consider this game to be one of my favorite games of all time, and for good reason. It's gameplay is fun, it's story is amazing, and I will always enjoy going back and replaying the game. If you haven't played this game, then you should play it.			",322,102,5,24,36,3,42

												Psychonauts is one of those games that you look back fondly at from the PS2 era, and when replaying it on PC you realize exactly how great it actually is. The game is fun and difficult, but also does NOT hold your hand and quite a few times I was stuck in an area trying to figure out exactly how to get to the next place even though I finished the game some 10 years ago. Definitely just as fun the second time.			",259,52,5,35,38,3,55

												8/10 - Very enjoyable and humorous adventure game.  Each level is different than the others, keeping the whole feel of the game new and exciting.  Exploration is also very rewarding since it goes hand-in-hand with the ""level up"" system.  While not particularly difficult, the camera angle and controls during the last stage can be a bit dodgy.			",69,14,0,5,1,0,0

												Exploring the minds of other campers was so entertaining that I feel it made this game worth it in spite of the near constant crashing issues that seem to plague a segment of the playerbase and the other negatives I'll get to.Pros:-Each level feels distitinct from the others and no one level is ""that level"" that I hated to play-Story pacing is adequate, I felt introduced to new plot points often enough to remain interested-The characters are fleshed out enough that the player can dig into their pasts and motivations through dialog or power  interactions (claravoiyance lets you see how they view you, for example)-The story was coherent and had a satsifiying conclusion and the main characters exhibited growth as charactersCons:-The player is rewarded with additional powers or upgrades by collecting a large number of collectables but the upgrades feel largely useless and the entire game could be beaten easily while ignoring the collectables-The Confusion grenade power was shoehorned in for one mini-boss and one boss fight in the same level and then has no effect on any enemies following that point.-There is a story-related point where the player recieves the Levitation power but subsequent levels are not designed around its use and it utterly removes all platforming from the game.-Constant crashing. This is only alleviated by the game autosaving at every loading screen so the player loses no progress.-The arrowhead currency is mostly useless except the two times the player is forced to hunt for them to buy an item in order to progress with the game. One of these two items is a dousing rod that only helps find more arrowheads to save up for the more expensive plot-related item.Again, even with the near-useless upgrades and powers, the forced hunting of arrowheads, and constant crashing Psychonauts is worth a play. The characters are interesting, the story is satsifying and not even a slightly lackluster platforming experience can detract from that.			",208,37,3,35,19,4,34

												I'm really glad I finally got around to playing and beating this game. It was easily the best game I've played in recent years. It's genuinely funny and unique and I don't think there's a game QUITE like this out there. I enjoyed this game the entire time I played it. Decent legnth and it never over-stayed its welcome, very nicely paced overall. The dialog especially was some of the best stuff I've seen since Jak/Ratchet.The art style, while very unique, is a bit dated these days. If you can get past that it looks pretty good.I can only hope that someday soon Tim Schafer will get the money and inspiration to make the sequel it so deserves. Maybe one day....

												This game ranks in my top 20 favorite games of all time. While the ""graphics"" would initially strike most as outdated, what this game lacks in pixels it makes up for 100 fold in brilliant dialoge, character and level design, humor, tight, fun controls and a plot that finally finds a breath of fresh air amongst all the cliches plaguing games right now.The creators of this game - while once well regarded in the videogame community - are now at the butt end of quite a lot of bad press; however this game is the one that I personally believe to be their aboslute treasures. It really takes me back to the days when platforming adventure games like Banjo Kazooie and Super Mario 64 reigned supreme. There are not enough good things I can say about this title. If you've never played it, then you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy asap and let your mind delve into the world of Psychonauts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It has a very diverse cast with each character having distinct a look and personality. The main character is fun to play with with many abilities to enhance his already well established zany personality. Level designed is colorful, flavorful and just plain fun!I highly recommend this title, specially if you are a fun of third person action/adventure platformers like super mario 64, legend of zelda: ocarina of time and rayman.

												It's a tragedy that there are not more games like this.Psychonauts is a 3rd-person 3D platformer which puts you in the shoes of Raz, a psychic prodigy who ran away from his circus family to join a summer camp for Psychics, in training to become Psychonauts.Psychonauts has you enter the minds of all sorts of different people and experience their inner psyche up close and personal. As you can imagine, this leads to some interesting visual design choices and a lot of laughs to boot.The gameplay is solid, Raz handles pretty well. One downside is that you can only have 3 abilities mapped to buttons at any one time and so you will be switching these constantly depending on the situation. Most of the game has you running around in peoples heads, collecting items and avoiding hazards.The graphics look dated, as they should do. It was an old game and a console port as well. It still holds up well, though, thanks to the great art direction, fluid animations and colorful environments. The audio is also fantastic, it has a great soundtrack and some excellent voice talent.This is a must-have if you're a PC gamer.			",1358,498,67,200,170,17,255

												Sometimes Double Fine just knocks it out of the park. Psychonauts is an endearing adventure/platforming game that is jam packed with style and charm. You play as Raz a young Psychonaut wannabe who runs away from home to pursue his ""dreams"" (see what I did there) at Camp Whispering Rock. Raz's ability to penetrate the minds of others creates for a varied and wild experience as each platforming level offers it own unique flavor. My only complaint is that cccassionally the ""cute"" is broken when Raz gets a bit off-color in his commentary towards the end of the game ... oh, and that they haven't developed a psyquel yet. As fun now as it was when I played it back on the original XBox.  I highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Creative? Original? Funny? Yes, yes, and yes.Psychonauts has joined that list of hipster games. You know the ones: games that everyone missed when they were first released, but we go back to them now because of good word of mouth and constant ""top 10"" anointment in gaming magazines. Having played Psychonauts apparently makes a person something of a gaming historian. So... I had to try it!While Psychonauts is a true original, it's not without flaws: cut scenes that go on forever; a bizarre lives/hit points system that serves no purpose; a story that wanders about and distracts from the imaginative gameplay; a brutal difficulty curve in the final 3 hours.Still, give it a try. There's nothing else quite like it, and in today's gaming landscape, that alone makes it worth a look.Lastly: Be aware that Double Fine updated this game in 2011 to improve the gameplay on PC, and released a Mac port, too. 5 years after the original release. So classy! Big love for Double Fine!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my backstory to the game, and not a discussion about the actual contents of the game. I wouldn't want to ruin this game for anybody.I was initially introduced to gaming by my father, who played Call of Duty competitively with his clan. He made sure to pick up a copy of the local gaming magazine, which was flourishing at the time, and brought it home. Every copy came with a disk which contained images, music, and game demos. One day, he showed me the demo for a game which very quickly caught my eye. I played this demo over, and over, doing everything possible without cheating to achieve everything one possibly could in the area given to you within this short game demonstration. One day, the game disappeared from my thoughts, and I completely forgot about it, and moved on with my life. Then, one day, I was browsing the Steam Store, and stumbled upon a game by the name of ""Psychonauts"". The title sounded incredibly familiar, so I went to the Store page of the game, and observed the video. It struck a sense of nostalgia inside of me, and this feeling caused me to buy the game. After waiting for it to install, I started it up. This was it, I realized.The full game of the demo which I had so readily devoured when I was but a wee spawn.This game doesn't reinvent the platforming concept, yet still delivers an experience which feels completely original in every possible sense of the word.Pros: Unique concept, beautifully bizarre art-style, great voice acting, phenomenal use of comedy, original and challenging puzzles.Cons: The game does provide some issues. The puzzles, whilst being original and challenging, can also present a certain sense of frustration at the sometimes sheer amount of abstract thinking one is required to do. If you aren't willing to sit down and invest 2+ hours when you start playing it during the day, afternoon, or evening, you'll miss out on a large part of the experience.Overall, a superb concept, amazingly executed. Psychonauts doesn't reinvent the platformer genre, but makes every aspect of it completely unique to the game.Worth every cent. I eagerly await the sequel.9.3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Your name is Razputin! But everyone calls you Raz.As your main character, circus-acrobat-turned-psychic-trainee, introduces himself to the others of the Whispering Rock Summer Camp, you begin to know you're in for something special. Welcome to the dark, humorous, and engaging world of Psychonauts.You play as the acrobatic, mentally powerful 10-year-old boy named Razputin, who runs away from his home at the circus to join an elite group of specialized secret agents, the Psychonauts, at their top-secret training facility (which happens to be disguised as a summer camp). There, he more-or-less joins with the other campers to train to one day become a Psychonaut agent. However, when his newfound friends' brains begin to go missing, it's up to Rasputin to locate the mysteriously misplaced cranial matter!The game, for the most part, is a 3D Platformer, but with an interesting take on the genre: You have access to a variety of psychic powers, from clairvoiyance to levitation to telekinesis and everything in between. This allows for a wide variety of challenges within the game, with different approaches to a problem being given (for example, whether to TK a nearby object into an enemy group, or to use Pyrokinesis to set a bombling alight).As the game's levels revolve around entering people's minds to help them solve a problem, the game's several stages are eccentric and often times fantastical, and almost always reflect their person's psychological state of mind; one character with bipolar mood swings has, inside their mind (which is set up like a theater, complete with actors playing the person's memorys), a lamp with a smiling face on one side, and a sorrowful one on the other, and when activated, will distort the memories to reflect the given emoton. One of the levels, Black Velvetopia, holds a special place in this review, for it's excellent backstory, smart level design, beautiful art style, and superb emotional allegory.Even though this may be a game from 2005, the graphic and music still stand out as some of the more strange and original of their kind. The level design is well done, keeping the game familiar yet fresh. The final level seems mostly based around parkour, and grows a tad tedious in the end. Despite this, it is still a great level, and the better parts of the stage outweigh the disappointments. The final boss, however, feels underwhelming, no matter how freaking cool it is.Overall, Psychonauts is a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat, laughing all the way. Easily worth the $10 admission fee. You don't need to be telepathic to know this is a winner.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An amazing story, very fun, lots of puzzles and bits to collect. One of my favourite games. Really great, huge variety of things to do. The first PONR is fine and can be reversed but there is a second less well-known one that drove me mad at the end of the Meat Circus, which stops me from playing the last level again so I'm stuck super close to 100%. This enraged me as a completionist. But if you don't plan on 100%ing, play it, it's great fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bias: I am a dino. I like to dream I have super psychic powers.Review long time coming. One of the first games I got on steam. If you have not played this game. You shouldQuirky, funny, and involves a lot of brain stealing shenanigans. Totally worth playing this. To be honest, I have enjoyed all the Double Fine titles I have played - This one led to me playing Brutal Legend and Costume Quest. Your quest is to allow the power of your untapped mind to save the kids of Whispering Rock from having their minds stolen and used by the mad man. This is a fun puzzle platformer with a lot of imagination and creativity. A lot of interesting backgrounds and imagery to suck you into the world of psychic powers. It was an enjoyable experience solving puzzles and fight bosses throughout the gameI do hope a sequel is released. It would definitely go to the top of my to play list.10/10 from me. Though the game is from 2005, it is still enjoyable and quite playable. With strong story, good puzzles, and fun boss fights.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've never seen people clamor so hard for a sequel as in the case of Psychonauts. The constant hype and praise heaped onto the game can give people unrealistic expectations and keep them away from it, which is a shame. Before I go into trying to convince you to give it a chance, though, I should point out that it is not a perfect game (while keeping spoilers to a minimum).• As a previous-gen title, the graphics in Psychonauts aren't stellar. They're fine enough to my eyes, but the blurry textures might discourage some.• The PC version is pretty much unplayable without a controller. More on that at the end of this review.• There's a notorious difficulty curve, though less so if you've played other 3D platformers. You'll spend a bit getting used to the controls and game mechanics, sail smooth for the majority of the game (sometimes being thrown a hard puzzle or boss fight), then spend the last level with half your bloodstream composed of adrenaline as you're forced to use everything you've learned under stressful circumstances. The achievement for the last level got its name for a reason.Okay, now I can gush and tell you why you SHOULD play this:• It's funny! I laugh at the same jokes I did when I played it on Xbox years ago, and then some since I'm old enough to understand more of them.• Assuming you're using a controller, the gameplay is flawless. Though you might be tempted to blame the game when you fall or tumble, the acrobatics are of the highest quality, which you would hope for in a platformer.• The story. I won't go into details here, since it's more fun to let you find it all out for yourself. The Steam product description provides a nice teaser, but it's only a small part of the tale.• The characters. Oh boy, this'll be the big bullet point. You wonder why people beg so much for a sequel? This is why. Whispering Rock is a summer camp filled with kids and (technically) employees, with personalities all their own. When I say that the description is only a small part, this is what I'm talking about. Almost all of the characters grow as people through the course of the game's events, and watching them do so is half the fun. Between levels (hell, before you start the first one), you'll want to wander around the campground for a bit and talk to the kids. Pretty much all of them have their own tiny subplots, even if they're just a handful of dialogue spaced out by an hour or two. A band tries to get off the ground, young love is in the air, and boys become men. They're all as compelling. But talking sometimes isn't enough. Some people have their traumatic secrets locked away, and you'll have to seek them out in the darkest corners of their minds.• The levels. This is another area where the game shines. Just like the people and their minds in which you'll find these lands, no two are alike. Again, I'd rather let you find this all out for yourself, but if playing through a Godzilla parody and defeating Napoleon Bonaparte at his own game don't sound appealing, this probably isn't for you.I could probably go on and find more to talk about, but then I'd be contributing to the problem of overhyping the game. It's not for no reason, though. In an industry where the best-selling game are first-person shooters, devoid of atmosphere, denied color, and depicting swaths of people getting killed in massive conflicts, Psychonauts is the antithesis. It's a tribute to childhood adventure presented as a colorful, humorous, varied third-person platformer with no (real) shooting to speak of. When you see 'MODERN BATTLE WAR 2K14: EXTRA GREY EDITION' sell copies by the millions every year, with no sequel in sight for Psychonauts due to underperforming in sales, you might begin to understand why people cling to this game like a liferaft.Is it flawless? No. I spent the entire second paragraph on that.Does it have a deep story making a commentary on the human condition? Probably not, but maybe. Certainly not Raz's; the story of a young boy trying to achieve his childhood dream has been told a thousand times over. But some of Whispering Rock's residents are flawed characters that have suffered genuine tragedy, but who may yet overcome their pasts, if only extended a genuine helping hand (I might be overthinking it, but I just love these characters so much).But the most important thing is that it's fun, which is the basis for a good video game. This is a game full of secrets, collectibles, and challenges. Other games with less have found love, and all the other stuff just made it that much better.This is where the review stops.This is my stop sign.Want to get that awful forced joke? Play the game.-NOTE ON CONTROLLER-Psychonauts' biggest problem is exclusive to the PC version. I HIGHLY recommend using a gamepad. Your best choice is the Xbox 360 Controller, given its high degree of support and close resemblance to the Xbox and PS2 controllers, with which Double Fine designed Psychonauts in mind. However, while you can just plug it in and be ready to go, inexperienced players won't know all of the buttons by heart. Steam user v00d00man has addressed this problem by developing an application called PsychoPad, which will replace the button images with the 360 controller's (or generic gamepad numeric buttons if you opted for something else).http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2151566You might also check out PsychoWide, which crops the cutscenes to your resolution instead of stretching them.

												I quite enjoy this game, as I was not able to play when it came out (just didn't have the money as I was too young to really make any amount of money at the time) but it's nice to have it ported over to Steam. A couple of problems, the mapping for keyboard only is........ Well it leaves something to be desired, it's not game breaking and if you really tried I'm sure it would all make sense, but the worst part of that is if you want to use a controller. Yes yes, I know, no true PC gamer would stray from the mouse and keyboard, but this game was never designed for mouse and keyboard, so I thought obviously using one would be preferred, but it's really not. It auto maps, but some things still require the keyboard and mouse along with it. I found a couple of glitches early on, stuttering frames where some audio cut in and out (nothing terrible, just noticable) and areas where the frames just drop for no apparent reason. But, all in all for a port, this is well worth the money, and coming from someone who can't have his nastalgia goggles on, I'd recommend it for sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you happen to be a Millennial gamer, Psychonauts needs to be on your gaming short-list.  Equal parts Nintendo platformer, LucasArts adventure, and 1990s era Nickelodeon cartoon, it was tailor-made to put a smile on your face.Whispering Rock Summer Camp is the home of our hero for the duration of the story, and much as Hogwarts instructs young wizards, this retreat is a school for psychics.  Using his mental abilities, Razputin will invade the thoughts of friend and foe alike, and these mindscapes will function as a range of diverse levels.  Ever have somebody tell you that some scary creature was more afraid of you than you were of it?  Raz has one of these moments with a giant mutated lungfish, and upon entering its head, he finds himself filling the role of Godzilla in a city of tiny lungfish.  This type of inventive fun has helped Psychonauts climb onto my own top ten list, and only the most curmudgeonly of cynics would fail to say the same.For a full review, check out:http://amanandhismouse.com/psychonauts.html ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to preface this a bit;  I love this game as much as anyone, but it's tedious if you want it to be.  When I first played this, I basically marathoned it over two long sittings.  I did everything I could, completely 100%'d the game.Now, returning to it after having bought it again on sale (Originally played on Xbox), I have to admit the game isn't suited to doing in such a complete fashion again.  Everything holds up, for the most part.  I absolutely adore running around the campgrounds, seeking out various items.  It's pretty basic, but the atmosphere invoked being so similar to that of a Saturday morning cartoon just pulls at my heartstrings something fierce.  When you get into the meat of the game, however, it falls apart a bit.  The platforming is mostly simple, and that's no issue.  It does what it should and it does it well enough.  The game is truly unique in its presentation, that's what makes it worth playing.  The real issue is with the figment collecting.  It's tedious as can be.It's like playing Banjo Kazooie or another collectathon, but everything you want to get, runs away from you.Through walls.It's very frustrating to run through a level more than once to find a chicken that just happens to hide in walls until the very second you turn around.All in all though, wonderful game.  A must play for anyone that loves games in my opinion, just don't get too caught up in seeing every little detail of this game.  The little things just hinder an otherwise amazing game, filled with detail and character not frequently seen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very well-written and funny, and the platforming is well done. The game only becomes frustrating in the rare event of the camera getting stuck at an unfortunate angle.UPDATE:First level is fairly weak, but the game really picks up off after the initial boss fight. Some very imaginative levels, and quirky characters that keep the game fun throughout. Platforming mechanics are solid, powers feel useful in many situations, and the camera manages to behave itself almost all the time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Inside Someone's MindStory:You take the Role of Raz, who just escaped the life of a circus performer to join a summer camp for children with Psychic abilities, with an unreasonable goal of becoming a Psychonaut in just mere days.Fortunately for Raz or perhaps not. This once peaceful learning camp is now in danger, as kids seem to be turning into TV obsessed Zombies.Its now up to him with the help of his teachers to uncover the culprit.The concept of going inside someone's mind,is what makes this game so appealing to me.You jump between the real world/hub world, a safe and familiar place, to this fantastic sets, showing the mind's representation of each characters fears.Its a great idea, with endless possibilities and Double Fine did good use of it. Every character as their own very distinct personalities and painful memories, each have their own unique mental world.As to what you should expect from the story in this gamePsychonauts started as a turned down idea for Full Throttle, and was the first title for Tim Schafer´s own company, Double Fine.This is what most people used to remember Shafer for, it's a Multi-layered narrative with alot of his own humor and charmGraphics:Psychonauts was never a good looking game, but the strong art style makes up for it in a way.If you ever watched animation around the 90´s, you probably noticed what Psychonauts is going for. All of these characters are human but with desproporcional bodies, sometimes hard to even recognize them as such.That art style extends to the sets themselves and everything fits perfectly togetherGameplay:Not cluttered but a bit all overFrom old school platformers to collectathons, Speed sections on rails and puzzle elements, bosses, fetch-questsyou name it.I will say it, i loved this game, but its hardly a fully fledged platformer, in the later levels it even gets a bit frustrating, calculating and timing your jump, is not always easy, thanks to flawed gameplay mechanicsTLTR?Pros:+Story+art style +Original concept+Variety+Strong characters+Voice acting+Humor+Music (sounds like Danny Elfman)Cons:-Textures-Platforming mechanics -Randomly crashes (not often, +with autosaves it's unlikely to lose progress)Score: 4/5 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whenever I think about this game I get a tear in my eye because this is one of the most inspired games I've ever seen.. 9.5/10Every level is unique and revolves around a few specific psychic abilities that you're given. What's neat about the abilities is that for most of them, you don't use only one for a level and then stop using it for the rest of the game. Each ability has its place in plenty of areas, from when you get it to the game's end. (The same kind of applies to the items you're given/you buy, many levels have extra goodies for you to go back and obtain with them!)The gameplay is super super fun but the camera can get a bit wonky at times, especially during levels that require elevation(like the area above the theatre level, which made me lose my sh*t :^) )The characters are all excellently characterized and the game does a very good job of thawing out their backstories. Another thing about the characters is they're all incredibly memorable; each and every one of them have fitting (and very talented, may I add) voice actors and unique designs that it's almost hard to forget any of them. (*Note: I am the Milkman.)I remember almost every scene from this game, and I mean maybe that's because it's only been 2-3 months since I've played it buuut I do believe I'll still remember them a year or two from now. Especially Goggalor... GOGGALOR!!!!!To be entirely honest, this is probably one of the best games I have ever played. If I had to give it a personal ranking, it's probably either my second or third favorite video game of all time beside Kingdom Hearts 2.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guys please, if you're reading this and you're genuinly interested in getting this game, by all means do it. It's definitely worth the price and you will put a good amount of hours into it, especially if you go for a bit of achievement hunting like I did. It'll also make you more excited for the upcoming sequel!!!(which I'm super super hyped for!) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A solid 3D platformer with an interesting and unpredictable story. Feels a lot like the Rare classics Banjo-Kazooie and Conker's Bad Fur Day. The level design is just fantastic in how it the game feel like an sandbox, even though you always have a specific task at hand.This game might be old, but it's still worth getting. Especially if you grab it on a sale. The graphic aged well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First by all, let me say this is not a normal game, this is a masterpiece.As a fan of graphic adventures and of Double Fine i approached to this game with the wrong thinking that it was another adventure with some platform elements, well, i was totally wrong, cause this is a 100% platform with some elements of adventure.This could have been a 100% game but cause of few flaws i can't give to it the top score and i will try to explain why. underlining the negative parts.First thing above all, the camera control is automatic, altough you can manually change it while playing, in the most hot actions you'll not think to change the camera while you're trying to jump and survive, so the result of this is that camera, sometime, suddenly changes making you jump in a wrong direction despite the one you wanted to go, this is a minor problem and happens just in few points but is enough for me to cut some score points.Second thing, i grow up with platforms in a time when graphic adventures (and most of all other kind of games) almost did not exist, so let me say i have quite some experiences in platforms, but this game will, occasionally, challenge your patience, cause some sections of jumps will be extremely annoying.The punching mini game you find in the beginning is one of the most annoying mini games ever i have played in long time, i really think here devs gone a bit too over in demaning things to complete it.Some of the achievements force you to do some of the most annoying grinding gathering you have ever done.The real strength of this game is in the plot and the story, it's very, very nice and will entertain you with a good portion of the best humor you can find inside an insane game (yes because all characters are really insane, literally ^^ )Being a game of 2005, the graphics are amazing, really awesome artworks from great artists.As a my personal opinion and preference i would have preferred that Double Fine had focused more on the adventure portion, adding more puzzles and less platform, but the final result remains outstanding giving to the player an unique gaming experience that will last long thanks to the good longevity of the game.My Final Score is 93 /100  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Originated as a mescaline-induced hallucination of “Full Throttle” playable character Ben, “Psychonauts” deliver truly psychedelic gaming experience, which is augmented by the fact that plot takes place in summer scout camp for psychic kids. And when you get a bit used to all the weirdos there, you start to enter other characters’ minds and delusions — including nut house’s patients, experimented on mutant lake fish, your teachers and yourself. And they differ alot and each delivers its own rules, physics and experience. It easily could have been an inspiration for “Inception” the movie, if it would be weirder.Gameplay is 3D platfomer with slight matroidvania elements.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most unique games ever created. In fact, it's more than a game, it's a piece of art. The worlds inside the minds of the characters are mind-blowing, the dialogs are hilarious, the plot is cleverly constructed, and bacon is a beacon. The only thing I didn't like in this game is that most of the characters were designed by 2D artists, and although they look great in the drawings, they look very bad in 3D (see e.g. Crystal and Clem). The last level is not as hard as its reputation suggests, especially since they made it much more forgiving in the Steam version than it is in the GOG version (that one is so old, it still has the Majesco logo).

												Haven't played much of it yet, I'm still at the campsite, but the gameplay is really fun. It's a 3D platformer with fun dialogue and fun combat, it has several collectibles in each level, including 'figments' which are 2D outlines of various things. There are lots of these to collect and it keeps exploration high. You start with pretty basic attacks - a punch combo and a ground pound - but every 10 levels you gain more. If you like 3D platformers, give it a shot. I could compare this to Ty the tasmanian tiger, which had partially similar visuals and controls, they also both had more powers or weapons available as you progressed. If you played and enjoyed Ty, You'll enjoy this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts is one of the best games I've ever played. It's a third person action/adventure game with a great story about brain theft at a psychic summer camp, and you're thrown into the middle of it as a psychic who ran away from the circus.Being set in a psychic summer camp, you already know you're in for some great special abilities like telekinesis and levitation, but by far the best feature of Psychonauts is that levels are created by entering someone's mind and dealing with all their emotional problems, fighting off the creatures that lurk within, and sorting out their emotional baggage (quite literally). Once you complete a stage, you leave that person in a much better emotional and mental state... well... that's the idea anyway.The musical score, sound effects, and particularly the voice acting is top tier, with the main character, Raz, voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz - who is probably best known as the voice of Invader Zim or maybe as Daggett from Angry Beavers.As good as Psychonauts is, it does have a few issues. The camera angle can be a bit annoying at times, but it's mostly alright. Also, I found myself unable to beat the game using a keyboard and mouse setup - one of the later levels has some platforming that felt impossible, but after I got myself an Xbox 360 controller I was able to get past that tricky section, so I'd say a decent controller is an absolute must.10 out of 10 I don't care if it had a few minor issues, the rest was so good I couldn't possibly give it a lower score.

												It took me a while to find this game, and when I did find it, I wasn't in a rush to buy it, as the screenshots on the store page didn't appeal to me that much. I ended up buying it with a few other games, not in a bundle, just together. I left it in my library for a few months, and I got bored and played it.... And I didn't stop until I finished it.You will regret your purchase of this game, but the part you will regret is not the money, but the time in which you waited until you played it. I know I regret it, I regret that I didn't find this game earlier, that I didn't play it WHEN it came out. But it's not too late to play, and the game has aged quite well (not that it was that old anyway). What makes this game so good that I am building it up so much? Everything about it is good.The whole theme of this game is insanity and telepathy. These themes are darkly and nicely woven into the levels and into the game. Going into other people's minds and seeing dark recesses of insane asyulms. Characters who are strange and twisted, phycopaths, Narcissists, multiple personalities, suicidal children, etc. The characters in this game will not disapoint, especially not Mr. Pokeylope. ;)The graphics stlyes are different depending on environment, which gives a very nice feeling to the game. It can be very dark and colourful, and go to being very bright and cheery. Which makes it practically impossibe to completely hate the stlye of the game, if you don't like the dark levels, you'll like the bright levels, but sometimes, you like all the levels.There is very little wrong with this game, some achievements are hard to get (but that's a plus), but other than that, you have little reason to not buy this game and play it. It is sitting up as one of my favourite (if not favourite) game. It was just such an enjoyable experience to play, and it's one that doesn't seem to be played by as many as it should be.

												I've never seen people clamor so hard for a sequel as in the case of Psychonauts. The constant hype and praise heaped onto the game can give people unrealistic expectations and keep them away from it, which is a shame. Before I go into trying to convince you to give it a chance, though, I should point out that it is not a perfect game (while keeping spoilers to a minimum).• As a previous-gen title, the graphics in Psychonauts aren't stellar. They're fine enough to my eyes, but the blurry textures might discourage some.• The PC version is pretty much unplayable without a controller. More on that at the end of this review.• There's a notorious difficulty curve, though less so if you've played other 3D platformers. You'll spend a bit getting used to the controls and game mechanics, sail smooth for the majority of the game (sometimes being thrown a hard puzzle or boss fight), then spend the last level with half your bloodstream composed of adrenaline as you're forced to use everything you've learned under stressful circumstances. The achievement for the last level got its name for a reason.Okay, now I can gush and tell you why you SHOULD play this:• It's funny! I laugh at the same jokes I did when I played it on Xbox years ago, and then some since I'm old enough to understand more of them.• Assuming you're using a controller, the gameplay is flawless. Though you might be tempted to blame the game when you fall or tumble, the acrobatics are of the highest quality, which you would hope for in a platformer.• The story. I won't go into details here, since it's more fun to let you find it all out for yourself. The Steam product description provides a nice teaser, but it's only a small part of the tale.• The characters. Oh boy, this'll be the big bullet point. You wonder why people beg so much for a sequel? This is why. Whispering Rock is a summer camp filled with kids and (technically) employees, with personalities all their own. When I say that the description is only a small part, this is what I'm talking about. Almost all of the characters grow as people through the course of the game's events, and watching them do so is half the fun. Between levels (hell, before you start the first one), you'll want to wander around the campground for a bit and talk to the kids. Pretty much all of them have their own tiny subplots, even if they're just a handful of dialogue spaced out by an hour or two. A band tries to get off the ground, young love is in the air, and boys become men. They're all as compelling. But talking sometimes isn't enough. Some people have their traumatic secrets locked away, and you'll have to seek them out in the darkest corners of their minds.• The levels. This is another area where the game shines. Just like the people and their minds in which you'll find these lands, no two are alike. Again, I'd rather let you find this all out for yourself, but if playing through a Godzilla parody and defeating Napoleon Bonaparte at his own game don't sound appealing, this probably isn't for you.I could probably go on and find more to talk about, but then I'd be contributing to the problem of overhyping the game. It's not for no reason, though. In an industry where the best-selling game are first-person shooters, devoid of atmosphere, denied color, and depicting swaths of people getting killed in massive conflicts, Psychonauts is the antithesis. It's a tribute to childhood adventure presented as a colorful, humorous, varied third-person platformer with no (real) shooting to speak of. When you see 'MODERN BATTLE WAR 2K14: EXTRA GREY EDITION' sell copies by the millions every year, with no sequel in sight for Psychonauts due to underperforming in sales, you might begin to understand why people cling to this game like a liferaft.Is it flawless? No. I spent the entire second paragraph on that.Does it have a deep story making a commentary on the human condition? Probably not, but maybe. Certainly not Raz's; the story of a young boy trying to achieve his childhood dream has been told a thousand times over. But some of Whispering Rock's residents are flawed characters that have suffered genuine tragedy, but who may yet overcome their pasts, if only extended a genuine helping hand (I might be overthinking it, but I just love these characters so much).But the most important thing is that it's fun, which is the basis for a good video game. This is a game full of secrets, collectibles, and challenges. Other games with less have found love, and all the other stuff just made it that much better.This is where the review stops.This is my stop sign.Want to get that awful forced joke? Play the game.-NOTE ON CONTROLLER-Psychonauts' biggest problem is exclusive to the PC version. I HIGHLY recommend using a gamepad. Your best choice is the Xbox 360 Controller, given its high degree of support and close resemblance to the Xbox and PS2 controllers, with which Double Fine designed Psychonauts in mind. However, while you can just plug it in and be ready to go, inexperienced players won't know all of the buttons by heart. Steam user v00d00man has addressed this problem by developing an application called PsychoPad, which will replace the button images with the 360 controller's (or generic gamepad numeric buttons if you opted for something else).http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2151566You might also check out PsychoWide, which crops the cutscenes to your resolution instead of stretching them.

												Very well-written and funny, and the platforming is well done. The game only becomes frustrating in the rare event of the camera getting stuck at an unfortunate angle.UPDATE:First level is fairly weak, but the game really picks up off after the initial boss fight. Some very imaginative levels, and quirky characters that keep the game fun throughout. Platforming mechanics are solid, powers feel useful in many situations, and the camera manages to behave itself almost all the time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First by all, let me say this is not a normal game, this is a masterpiece.As a fan of graphic adventures and of Double Fine i approached to this game with the wrong thinking that it was another adventure with some platform elements, well, i was totally wrong, cause this is a 100% platform with some elements of adventure.This could have been a 100% game but cause of few flaws i can't give to it the top score and i will try to explain why. underlining the negative parts.First thing above all, the camera control is automatic, altough you can manually change it while playing, in the most hot actions you'll not think to change the camera while you're trying to jump and survive, so the result of this is that camera, sometime, suddenly changes making you jump in a wrong direction despite the one you wanted to go, this is a minor problem and happens just in few points but is enough for me to cut some score points.Second thing, i grow up with platforms in a time when graphic adventures (and most of all other kind of games) almost did not exist, so let me say i have quite some experiences in platforms, but this game will, occasionally, challenge your patience, cause some sections of jumps will be extremely annoying.The punching mini game you find in the beginning is one of the most annoying mini games ever i have played in long time, i really think here devs gone a bit too over in demaning things to complete it.Some of the achievements force you to do some of the most annoying grinding gathering you have ever done.The real strength of this game is in the plot and the story, it's very, very nice and will entertain you with a good portion of the best humor you can find inside an insane game (yes because all characters are really insane, literally ^^ )Being a game of 2005, the graphics are amazing, really awesome artworks from great artists.As a my personal opinion and preference i would have preferred that Double Fine had focused more on the adventure portion, adding more puzzles and less platform, but the final result remains outstanding giving to the player an unique gaming experience that will last long thanks to the good longevity of the game.My Final Score is 93 /100  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Haven't played much of it yet, I'm still at the campsite, but the gameplay is really fun. It's a 3D platformer with fun dialogue and fun combat, it has several collectibles in each level, including 'figments' which are 2D outlines of various things. There are lots of these to collect and it keeps exploration high. You start with pretty basic attacks - a punch combo and a ground pound - but every 10 levels you gain more. If you like 3D platformers, give it a shot. I could compare this to Ty the tasmanian tiger, which had partially similar visuals and controls, they also both had more powers or weapons available as you progressed. If you played and enjoyed Ty, You'll enjoy this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I quite enjoy this game, as I was not able to play when it came out (just didn't have the money as I was too young to really make any amount of money at the time) but it's nice to have it ported over to Steam. A couple of problems, the mapping for keyboard only is........ Well it leaves something to be desired, it's not game breaking and if you really tried I'm sure it would all make sense, but the worst part of that is if you want to use a controller. Yes yes, I know, no true PC gamer would stray from the mouse and keyboard, but this game was never designed for mouse and keyboard, so I thought obviously using one would be preferred, but it's really not. It auto maps, but some things still require the keyboard and mouse along with it. I found a couple of glitches early on, stuttering frames where some audio cut in and out (nothing terrible, just noticable) and areas where the frames just drop for no apparent reason. But, all in all for a port, this is well worth the money, and coming from someone who can't have his nastalgia goggles on, I'd recommend it for sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Inside Someone's MindStory:You take the Role of Raz, who just escaped the life of a circus performer to join a summer camp for children with Psychic abilities, with an unreasonable goal of becoming a Psychonaut in just mere days.Fortunately for Raz or perhaps not. This once peaceful learning camp is now in danger, as kids seem to be turning into TV obsessed Zombies.Its now up to him with the help of his teachers to uncover the culprit.The concept of going inside someone's mind,is what makes this game so appealing to me.You jump between the real world/hub world, a safe and familiar place, to this fantastic sets, showing the mind's representation of each characters fears.Its a great idea, with endless possibilities and Double Fine did good use of it. Every character as their own very distinct personalities and painful memories, each have their own unique mental world.As to what you should expect from the story in this gamePsychonauts started as a turned down idea for Full Throttle, and was the first title for Tim Schafer´s own company, Double Fine.This is what most people used to remember Shafer for, it's a Multi-layered narrative with alot of his own humor and charmGraphics:Psychonauts was never a good looking game, but the strong art style makes up for it in a way.If you ever watched animation around the 90´s, you probably noticed what Psychonauts is going for. All of these characters are human but with desproporcional bodies, sometimes hard to even recognize them as such.That art style extends to the sets themselves and everything fits perfectly togetherGameplay:Not cluttered but a bit all overFrom old school platformers to collectathons, Speed sections on rails and puzzle elements, bosses, fetch-questsyou name it.I will say it, i loved this game, but its hardly a fully fledged platformer, in the later levels it even gets a bit frustrating, calculating and timing your jump, is not always easy, thanks to flawed gameplay mechanicsTLTR?Pros:+Story+art style +Original concept+Variety+Strong characters+Voice acting+Humor+Music (sounds like Danny Elfman)Cons:-Textures-Platforming mechanics -Randomly crashes (not often, +with autosaves it's unlikely to lose progress)Score: 4/5 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whenever I think about this game I get a tear in my eye because this is one of the most inspired games I've ever seen.. 9.5/10Every level is unique and revolves around a few specific psychic abilities that you're given. What's neat about the abilities is that for most of them, you don't use only one for a level and then stop using it for the rest of the game. Each ability has its place in plenty of areas, from when you get it to the game's end. (The same kind of applies to the items you're given/you buy, many levels have extra goodies for you to go back and obtain with them!)The gameplay is super super fun but the camera can get a bit wonky at times, especially during levels that require elevation(like the area above the theatre level, which made me lose my sh*t :^) )The characters are all excellently characterized and the game does a very good job of thawing out their backstories. Another thing about the characters is they're all incredibly memorable; each and every one of them have fitting (and very talented, may I add) voice actors and unique designs that it's almost hard to forget any of them. (*Note: I am the Milkman.)I remember almost every scene from this game, and I mean maybe that's because it's only been 2-3 months since I've played it buuut I do believe I'll still remember them a year or two from now. Especially Goggalor... GOGGALOR!!!!!To be entirely honest, this is probably one of the best games I have ever played. If I had to give it a personal ranking, it's probably either my second or third favorite video game of all time beside Kingdom Hearts 2.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guys please, if you're reading this and you're genuinly interested in getting this game, by all means do it. It's definitely worth the price and you will put a good amount of hours into it, especially if you go for a bit of achievement hunting like I did. It'll also make you more excited for the upcoming sequel!!!(which I'm super super hyped for!) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to preface this a bit;  I love this game as much as anyone, but it's tedious if you want it to be.  When I first played this, I basically marathoned it over two long sittings.  I did everything I could, completely 100%'d the game.Now, returning to it after having bought it again on sale (Originally played on Xbox), I have to admit the game isn't suited to doing in such a complete fashion again.  Everything holds up, for the most part.  I absolutely adore running around the campgrounds, seeking out various items.  It's pretty basic, but the atmosphere invoked being so similar to that of a Saturday morning cartoon just pulls at my heartstrings something fierce.  When you get into the meat of the game, however, it falls apart a bit.  The platforming is mostly simple, and that's no issue.  It does what it should and it does it well enough.  The game is truly unique in its presentation, that's what makes it worth playing.  The real issue is with the figment collecting.  It's tedious as can be.It's like playing Banjo Kazooie or another collectathon, but everything you want to get, runs away from you.Through walls.It's very frustrating to run through a level more than once to find a chicken that just happens to hide in walls until the very second you turn around.All in all though, wonderful game.  A must play for anyone that loves games in my opinion, just don't get too caught up in seeing every little detail of this game.  The little things just hinder an otherwise amazing game, filled with detail and character not frequently seen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you happen to be a Millennial gamer, Psychonauts needs to be on your gaming short-list.  Equal parts Nintendo platformer, LucasArts adventure, and 1990s era Nickelodeon cartoon, it was tailor-made to put a smile on your face.Whispering Rock Summer Camp is the home of our hero for the duration of the story, and much as Hogwarts instructs young wizards, this retreat is a school for psychics.  Using his mental abilities, Razputin will invade the thoughts of friend and foe alike, and these mindscapes will function as a range of diverse levels.  Ever have somebody tell you that some scary creature was more afraid of you than you were of it?  Raz has one of these moments with a giant mutated lungfish, and upon entering its head, he finds himself filling the role of Godzilla in a city of tiny lungfish.  This type of inventive fun has helped Psychonauts climb onto my own top ten list, and only the most curmudgeonly of cynics would fail to say the same.For a full review, check out:http://amanandhismouse.com/psychonauts.html ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everyone who as ever played this game says how great it is...And I am one one them. First, the strongest part of this game is how it is written. Every character has their own unique way of talking and even if they are just repeating the same diologue over and over you can't help but enjoy.Next, the controls....Not going to lie, I would use an Xbox controler for this, I have beaten it on the PC using the keyboard and mouse, but it is suited best for a controler. The story is great too, it keeps evolving with a great mystery that if you didn't figure out on your own you can look back and see the little clues and hints to it. I cannot say enough good things about this game just.... I am a house wife, I enjoy making pies			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

VERDICT:Buy Immediately (9.8/10)Completion Time: 25-30 hoursBottom Line: ""Don't just play this game for the memorable story, the characters, or the adventure, JUST DO IT FOR THE KIDS MAN.""PROS+Awesome story+Suprisingly mature humor+Winning gameplay formula+Hilarious characters+Unique worldCONS-You will sometimes get lost-Platforming difficultiesREVIEWThis is an adult's game disguised in XS kids clothing. On the outside, this is a game about a children's day camp, but venture a little deeper and you'll find one of the most quarky, hilarious, and enthralling adventures that successfully stands the test of time.Our hero is Rasputin (AKA Raz), a young boy that runs away from his job at the circus in order to hone his supernatural abilities at a day camp for young psychics. It only takes a day for him to realize that something is terribly wrong: some of the campers are starting to literally lose their minds. It is your job to not only become an official psychic expert, but to find the culprit behind the missing brains!This is your traditional adventure-platformer in the same vain as Mario 64 or the Spyro franchise. You'll be running around completing tasks for different camp patrons to advance the story, all while traversing terrain and taking down baddies.Let me just say that this cast of characters is one of the most endearingly dysfunctional groups of people you'll ever meet. From delusional old men to stereotypical FBI agents to a bully with a lisp, all the classic stereotypes are in full force here.Gameplay is split into two different zones: free roam and brain sequences. During free roam you can roam the camp grounds searching for collectables and meeting new people. Brain sequences take place inside your brain and involve whimsical levels reminiscent of a bad dream, or someone that's tripping really hard. Everything in this game, regardless of location, has the same distinct art style, and this is the type of style that doesn't age with time.The gameplay itself is incredibly fun. Throughout the game you'll be gaining new abilities to take on your foes. These include telekenesis, levetation, invisibility, and more. Each ability has its purpose, and will come into play at some point in the game. There are also many puzzle aspects of gameplay, and these puzzles are damn fun. My favorite puzzle was when I had to play a game of Catan (not actually Catan but something similar) in order to defeat a boss. It was one of the coolest levels I have ever played.The cons are few and in between. Sometimes I got lost in this game, and it was unclear where I needed to go to advance the story. Also, some platforming sections were frustrating, or it wasn't necessarily obvious what I had to do to advance in the level. Regardless of these hiccups, I always managed to find my way eventually.If there's one thing I want you to take away from this review its this: this game is memorable. Each level is incredibly unique. Each character is different and has their own idiosycracies that make them hilarious. Each boss fight has different mechanics that make you think. And the last level is a tremendous challenge that makes you feel like you've accomplished something monumental upon its completion.Don't just play this game for the memorable story, the characters, or the adventure, JUST DO IT FOR THE KIDS MAN.

												If you have not already bought this game. Find the sharpest metal object next to you, and jam it into your hand. This is your punishement for not buying this game. Whilst steam says I only have played a few hours on this, I have played it offline much longer. This is contested for my favourite game of all time, with Bioshock. The Storyline is good, the gameplay core mechanics are wonderful and if you can excuse some dodgy platforming at times it makes a good experience. It seems to have a difficulty curve like Micheal Jacksons music career and makes the last 3 levels extremly difficult. There is many secrets to be found and frankly if I can set squirrels on fire then I will play the game to my hearts content.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts is fantastic.  It is BEYOND unique and original, and has great writing and characters.  It can be incredibly bizzare at times, but in the end it only makes it better.  It's a bit dated by now, but where the graphics fall short, the gameplay makes up for it.... I don't really know where I'm going with this.  It's a great game.

VERDICT:Buy Immediately (9.8/10)Completion Time: 25-30 hoursBottom Line: ""Don't just play this game for the memorable story, the characters, or the adventure, JUST DO IT FOR THE KIDS MAN.""PROS+Awesome story+Suprisingly mature humor+Winning gameplay formula+Hilarious characters+Unique worldCONS-You will sometimes get lost-Platforming difficultiesREVIEWThis is an adult's game disguised in XS kids clothing. On the outside, this is a game about a children's day camp, but venture a little deeper and you'll find one of the most quarky, hilarious, and enthralling adventures that successfully stands the test of time.Our hero is Rasputin (AKA Raz), a young boy that runs away from his job at the circus in order to hone his supernatural abilities at a day camp for young psychics. It only takes a day for him to realize that something is terribly wrong: some of the campers are starting to literally lose their minds. It is your job to not only become an official psychic expert, but to find the culprit behind the missing brains!This is your traditional adventure-platformer in the same vain as Mario 64 or the Spyro franchise. You'll be running around completing tasks for different camp patrons to advance the story, all while traversing terrain and taking down baddies.Let me just say that this cast of characters is one of the most endearingly dysfunctional groups of people you'll ever meet. From delusional old men to stereotypical FBI agents to a bully with a lisp, all the classic stereotypes are in full force here.Gameplay is split into two different zones: free roam and brain sequences. During free roam you can roam the camp grounds searching for collectables and meeting new people. Brain sequences take place inside your brain and involve whimsical levels reminiscent of a bad dream, or someone that's tripping really hard. Everything in this game, regardless of location, has the same distinct art style, and this is the type of style that doesn't age with time.The gameplay itself is incredibly fun. Throughout the game you'll be gaining new abilities to take on your foes. These include telekenesis, levetation, invisibility, and more. Each ability has its purpose, and will come into play at some point in the game. There are also many puzzle aspects of gameplay, and these puzzles are damn fun. My favorite puzzle was when I had to play a game of Catan (not actually Catan but something similar) in order to defeat a boss. It was one of the coolest levels I have ever played.The cons are few and in between. Sometimes I got lost in this game, and it was unclear where I needed to go to advance the story. Also, some platforming sections were frustrating, or it wasn't necessarily obvious what I had to do to advance in the level. Regardless of these hiccups, I always managed to find my way eventually.If there's one thing I want you to take away from this review its this: this game is memorable. Each level is incredibly unique. Each character is different and has their own idiosycracies that make them hilarious. Each boss fight has different mechanics that make you think. And the last level is a tremendous challenge that makes you feel like you've accomplished something monumental upon its completion.Don't just play this game for the memorable story, the characters, or the adventure, JUST DO IT FOR THE KIDS MAN.

												Seriously people, it's a cult classic for a reason. If you're planning on buying this wait until it's on crazy sale (Bought my copy when it was going for practically 1.75$ CAN ) because around the halfway point when there's not much left to learn the game gets MAD difficult, and if you buy it for the 9.99$ current full price, you might feel like you have wasted your money. Besides that, who honestly doesn't want to fool (Without spoiling anything) agents into thinking you're one of them? Or become Godzilla? Of hell, simply light things on fire? This game really has it all in lue of imagenation (Here's looking at you Godzilla level that took me forever). Plus you get to play as a kid from the circus that decided to run away from it (Rather than TO it as many children must have planned to do at some point in childhood before they were allowed to cross the streets by themselves... I know I did... Sat on the curb for three hours huffing that my plans had been foiled by the road, what can I say, I was -and still am- adventerous) All in all, it's a darn good game. You'd be hard pressed to find another Tim Schafer gem like this one... Critisizm would be that darn difficulty curve... Oh and like, four of the kids in the game are aggrivatingly annoying as ♥♥♥♥, but at least there's only one 'Escort' thing that's totally optional, but nets you some sweet, sweet arrowheads (Money in this game) if you do it (And it's simple as hell if you're quick to reassure the character that they can make it). Other than that, it's a really good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As someone who had never played a third person platformer, with a mouse and keyboard before, this game was a blast. Don't be daunted by the precedent of The Meat Circus level, it really isn't that awful, not to mention that there are guides out there if need be. The story, humor, and art are all top notch. The level design is simply godly and constantly blew my mind. Honestly, there is too much great stuff about this game that it well exceeds its full price of $10. Just pick it up, you won't regret it.

												The writing is very funny, which you won’t see in this industry very often, because in this apparently, in this industry stupid drama is better than smart comedy. The story is very original and interesting, I don’t wish to spoil it so you will have to trust me on this one. Every character has his own personality and struggles, even the unimportant ones, which is nice to see in this land of Mr. Johnny Testosterone Space Marine and Mrs. Sassy Action Chick.    The gameplay is intresting, but it has it’s flaws (they might be forgivable), the psychic powers are awesome and the boss fights really require skill, every boss has it’s own weak spot, you have to deduce it by watching it’s attacks. On the other hand the camera can be a little female dog some times. The combat outside the boss fights is kind of meh. The difficulty curve is a little bit messed up, there were sequences near the end that almost made break my keyboard. However I never stopped playing it, because I really wanted to see the ending, and I haven’t left disappointed.  The ending promised a sequel and I really hope to see the day when Psychonauts 2 will be released!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a fan of 3D platformers with a spare dollar to spend during a Steam sale, I decided to give Double Fine Productions' cult classic Psychonauts a try. After hearing about the alleged creativity and uniqueness the game offered, I wondered if the reviews were to be believed.  Psychonauts follows the adventure of an eager young psychic named Razputin as he uncovers the secrets behind Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp, along with the minds of various characters around the area. When things take a turn for the worst, it becomes up to him to put an end to it and save his fellow campers. Though the distinct graphical style may initially scare some players off, its fits the tone of the game to a 'T'. Psychonauts seems to take much of its inspiration from Western animation in terms of its character tropes and setting, and it definitely works. Combined with the superb voice acting, interesting plot and remarkable concept, the atmosphere is definitely an enjoyable one. Along with the characters and overall mood the game gives off, the level design and gameplay is superb. The hub area is a nice concept, allowing the player to see what their favorite campers are up to while they take a break from the story. Along with housing numerous secret items, it also allows them to quickly transmit to and fro each section at will. Being a game called ""Psychonauts"", it certainly shines during the levels taking place in the minds Razputin enters. Each of these possesses a unique feeling and theme to reflect the personality of the character in question. Each level also hosts their own set of challenges, and will make the player eager to progress and see what awaits them. Unfortunately, there is not much left to be explored of each world once it is cleared for the first time – the player only needs to return unless they are aiming to gather all the collectable items.On an entirely different note, the player is given an item early in the game that allows them to ask for advice if they are stuck. The advice offered is simple, yet effective and allows the player to work around most obstacles without the game flat-out doing it for them. The game does not push or force the player to use this feature, allowing this to appeal to both those who are easily frustrated and those who want to work things out for themselves.Of course no game is perfect, and Psychonauts is no exception to this rule. While I do not intend to sound like a certain critic featured within the game, Psychonauts possesses a few flaws which prevent it from becoming my absolute favorite. The keyboard controls feel very confusing and complicated, making a controller almost necessary to play this game; although once this is done it handles rather nicely. A certain level in the game titled ""The Milkman Conspiracy"" prevents you from progressing unless you purchase an expensive item which removes the object blocking the path, which have previously only appeared in locations that would indicate this would be an optional side quest. Though the game warns the player of this obstacle beforehand, this still forces them to tediously grind for currency. The very same level also possesses a more puzzle-based structure which requires a copious amount of backtracking as well as repeatedly searching the area for objects which can easily be missed. A miniboss is also fought here twice with no warning, variation, or possibility of skipping. While this is an understandable attempt to give the level some of the action offered by previous worlds, it becomes tedious and annoying when introduced in this fashion. Thankfully, this area is one of the game's most humor-rich areas which makes up for a good deal of its flaws, but it still is far from ideal. Though the game has its imperfections here and there, Psychonauts is certainly an enjoyable and memorable experience for fans of the platformer genre. On a final note - if you do purchase the game, be wary that much of the game's content is spoiled through achievements and trading cards.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sure it has its flaws, its gameplay is a bit sluggish, it has no replay value, the lv design is a tad unorthodox to say the least, and the camera is pretty bad at times, but what it does have is truly a 1 of a kind experience that I probably won't ever relive flaws and all.Just play it, its cheap and you won't forget it.

If historic value alone doesn't sell you, it's a great classic-style platformer, the likes of which don't get made often anymore.

												Get this game! Psychonauts is one of those gems you most likely have missed out on. It pulls you through your ""victims"" brain and you see the world as they see it. This makes the world look brilliantly different when considering that some of the brain-owners are slightly or completely insane. I would play it just for the strange setting and the sheer weirdness of the worlds. At the bottom of it all, it is a semi action-adventure-platformer which utilizes ""spells""(or rather ""brain spells"" such as telekinesis) to get to the objective. If you are even remotely interested in either platformers or adventure games you should already have played this game. Only bad things I can come to think of is that the camera is a bit wonky at times(which sadly was the case for all 3d platformers back when this was released), the difficulty sort of explodes at a certain point in the game(in other words; it's not a natural evolving difficulty curve), and (SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING!!! SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING!!!)Towards the end you are locked inside the brain dimension due to actions taken in the outside world.  This makes it impossible to get the remaining collectible items if you are into that sort of things.(END SLIGHT SPOILER! END SLIGHT SPOILER!)All in all it's an amazing game and you can get it for under 10€ which makes it a bargain.Get it, play it, love it. Hypnotoad demands it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow this game...wow..i mean..the characters, the music, the worlds, THE FREAKIN WORLDS. Okay enough with the gushing. Ths game is not as hyped as it should be. Double fine and Tim Schafer are quite good and imaginative and that is most apparent in games like this one and Brutal Legend (which i love as well). Originally PS2 era, the steam port is not that bad. A controler wouldn't hurt becuase some of the platforming is a bit annoying with keyboard and mouse. The story? You play Razputin (or just Raz) who sneaks away from his circus life to attend a summer camp for a group of traniee psychic agents known as ""Psychonauts"". Raz's family, especially his father, are heavily opposed to pyschics, seeing as a pyschic cursred Raz's grand father to drown in  water, thus starting the belief that all in Raz's family share the curse. Wanting to break away from his circus life, he decides to join the psychonauts, who have the ability to enter different worlds in different people's minds. The world's are very creative, my favorite world is Black Veletopia becuase the colors were so great to look at. behind the game's quirky exterior, lies characters who have deep backgrounds and personaities that are hard to forget. This game is pretty under-rated and is worth a pick up. The highly imaginative worlds with hilarious, yet deep, characters are enough to entise anyone into the world of Pyschonauts.

												I've enjoyed the other Double Fine games like Costume Quest and Stacking, but Psychonauts is something special. I honestly didn't expect a game of this magnitude. It's an amazing action, adventure, platformer with a wacky, yet funny story. The gameplay reminds me of Alice: Madness Returns, but it's actually way better. It offers excellent writing and voice acting, superb (although low res) cinematics, solid missions and quests, fun character building, and a small, but open world to explore. I'm still in awe at how good Psychonauts is--just hands down a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you love 3D platforming games with a character gaining powers and the that feel of a Nickelodeon cartoon, look no further since you too can be an Psychonaut!

												As much as I am not a fan of Mr. Schafer right now, this game is an underrated masterpiece. A sheer joy to play and explore, and it will bring you right back to your youthful days at summer camp ... with a sci-fi twist. Turns out being a psychic warrior and diving into minds is a lot of fun!I always wished you could explore more minds, though, but probably couldn't due to space and hardware limitations.

												There really are no words to describe how amazing this game is. The level design, character progression and hilarious humor gags are a few of the many reasons this game is worth more than the price of admission on Steam. Double Fine is a superb video game company who care a lot about their customers so this port has controller support and has less bugs than any other platform. My only gripe would be that there is no sequel; as it rightly deserves a full franchise :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts has likeable characters, clever worldbuilding, and is overall full of personailty.That said, it REALLY shows that Tim was more used to adventure games than 3-D collect-a-thon platformers.When there are adventure-game-type puzzles (like Gloria's Theater or the Milkman Conspiracy), the game really shines. Unfortunately, that's not the majority of the game. The majority of the game involves gimmicky powers (I never used the shield outside the level you get it in, and Clairvoyance mostly just has comedic effect), very basic platforming (and even MORE basic combat), and some of the most tedious collect-a-thon-ing I've seen in any game.You may have noticed that, despite all this, I am still recommending the game. Why? Because it was a fun ride despite these glaring flaws. The atmosphere alone compensates for many of these issues tenfold. The various worlds you explore are neat, and the art style is solid.I'm glad I played it, I'm just unlikely to play it again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was always on the outside looking in when it came to Psychonauts. Never really played it when I was younger, but heard it was a great game from others. I decided to give it a try on a whim and was incredibly pleased with my decision.It is a phenomenal game.There are so many fun-loving, humorous portions of the game. While, at a closer look, you can pluck out some dark underlying sub-plots. These can range from intense paranoia, insanity, heartbreak, and obviously enough, death. You are playing around in a game and you are playing around in people's minds. There is so much twisted fun to be had.The one thing I would not recommend you do is play on mouse & keyboard. I tried to go as long as I could without a controller, but finally buckled and got one when it came to more ""combat-heavy"" sections of the game.TL;DR - You will not regret playing this. (Unless it leaves you wanting more and you have to wait for Psychonauts 2...)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

IT'S ONLY $10 AND USALY ON SALE!! JUST BUY THE GAME!! HOLY CRAP THIS GAME IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But in all seriousness, this game has a memorable cast of characters, a very funny and quirky plot and probibly one of the most intresting ideas for a game I could ever think of. Now the only downside I can think of is around the time you reach the asylum, everything kind of screaches to a halt so you can help some patients out. Also the game suffers from ""Point of no return"" syndrome. As soon as you free a certain someone from a mad doctor, you CAN NOT go back to the overworld. So you can not go back and finish side quests AT ALL.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had this game when I was very young, when it first came out on the original XBox. I played it for hours on end, day in and day out. Nothing was alble to stop me. Then, one day, I happened to look at the bottom of the disk and noticed that I couldn't see the silvery part very well because it had been scratched so badly. I played it for another day or so and suddenly it wouldn't work anymore. Seeing as they didn't make the game anymore and we couldn't resurface the disk, I was out of luck. Until the day I saw it on Steam. I bought it faster than instantly and, as of today, my 10-year goal to finish the game has been completed.8/10       Unfortunately, even though it's my favoritest game of all time, there are some bugs and things that aren't smoothed out, such as moving while turning the camera sometimes messes up and some swingy bars are hard to grab onto, but all in all there are some great puzzles and a wonderful story with humor mixed in somewhere along the way. Definitely worth checking out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I picked up Psychonauts after consistently hearing it referenced as one of the best games ever by people in the games industry. I'm in complete agreement - this is now one of my favorite games. I laughed out loud more often here than in any other game. The level design and variety of art styles is excellent. Gameplay is generally very good and the various psychic powers are fun to play with.Downsides: A few levels and collectible quests can be somewhat frustrating due to precise timing requirements alongside slightly finicky controls (definitely take the time to remap the key/mouse actions as the defaults can be difficult to work with). Also, there comes a point late in the game beyond which you can't go back to the main game area to complete collectible quests or achievements.Two people in our house have put in 150 hours of play on this game. We're playing on a Mac and this version has been smooth and stable with no issues.Update: I was prompted to revisit this review as part of the Steam Autumn Sale 2016. My comments on the game remain valid except for the last paragraph. When we first played the game, it was made as a PC port inside a Mac ""wrapper"" (Transgaming, I think). This can be problematic for newer, more powerful games, but suited Psychonauts just fine. At some point, however, Double Fine decided to rebuild the game as a native Mac game. This can be a great thing for a game that doesn't work well in a wrapper, but in this case it made the game a lot worse - missing textures, stuttering, sometimes only marginally playable. Many of these issues were addressed over time, but as of the last time we played it was still inferior to the first release. At this point it's fixed enough that I wouldn't reverse my recommendation, just something to be aware of if you'll be playing it on a Mac.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1) Essential purchase2) Recommended purchase3) Recommended purchase during a sale4) Not recommended unless heavily discounted5) Not even recommended for Steam game collectorsLooking for something different? This 2005 classic never seemed to get the love it deserved. I've only now gotten to check it out, but its got me hooked from the start. You play as Razputin (voiced by Richard Horvitz, VA of Zim, Billy, Pox, and Orthopox from Invader Zim, Billy and Mandy, and Destroy all Humans respectively) who has snuck away from his circus home to participate in a summer camp for psychics. I hear you thinking: ""Psychics? Does that mean puzzles?"" To which I say, nay! It means platforming! Literally enter the minds of your victi- er, volunteers, and journey through their mindscapes to learn of their pasts and uncover the horrible truth of the camp. Double Fine isn't known for good gameplay, and while its not the greatest here, I think its deserving of a try.Sounds fun, right? Well it is, but it is not without fault. If you're a stickler for graphics you may be dissapointed in the fairly low budget visuals in this ten year old game, but the atmosphere and mood are set very well. My one complaint are the boss battles, of which you get one every hour or two (at least for the first six hours, which is what I've done at the time of writing). They rely on a simple dodge-wait for weak spot to be exposed-spam attack-repeat formula which is never mixed up very much.The story, I feel, is pretty good. Its nothing spectacular and I can't say much without spoiling, but I'm enjoying it.All in all, check this game out if you have interest in Double Fine, clever/trippy visuals, platformers, or horror movies.NOTE: At some point in the game there's an underwater section where you totally lose control of the camera. Near the end of it the camera bugged so Raz was almost never onscreen. Reset your resolution to 800x600 and die a few times to go back a checkpoint. This fixed it for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The art style is anything but normal which is great, and it is really fun to play such an abstract game like this. And the level design, wow, I feel like they really got it spot on, and the world i full of these little secrets which,  sometimes may be burning children, but the rest are all good...The main reason I got this game was because I heard NerdCubed talking about, and 'cause it was on sale *cough cough, but it was really great and you dont often see many games like this.

												Grandma went to the K-Mart and bought me this game the other day, it is about one of Grandpa's old friends from the war. In it, Grandpa's friend, Arthur spends his days in an underground cave and also does janitor work. It features one of Grandpa's favorite things ever in a video game. Milk. In a mission you drink milk and stop spys from stealing all of the milk. Grandma sure loves Grandpa's milk... ;)I let Billy play this game and he never came out of his room, I had to tell him his girlfriend was in the hospital to get him to leave, because nothing else worked. I was kidding of course, but he cried for weeks thinking she had cancer. Grandpa gives this game a 10/10 because it has Grandpa's friend in it, milk, and Billy likes it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you’re interested in children, magic, and camps surrounded by tall fences ruled by a dictator, then you are most likely a perverted Nazi. However, If you’re interested in children, magic, and camps surrounded by tall fences ruled by a dictator, then you are a completely normal person and you will enjoy this game with a passionate passion.  In this game you spend most of your time in peoples minds uncovering the lost secrets of their pasts, and while doing so you can collected a bunch of weird chalk drawings that do nothing besides destroy the OCD part of you. These chalk drawings will consume your life, soul, and bodily fluids as at first they are easy to spot giving you a false sense of accomplishment. This easy peasy mindset lasts until the last one where you have to jump across the universe upside down on one leg blindfolded with a firecracker up your butt to get it. Since it’s the last one you have to get it, you're a gamer, OCD and completion run in your veins. Every fiber in your body is saying ""go on get the last chalk drawing"" but you must resist. IT IS FUTILE. You will never get that last chalk drawing just like how Pluto will never again be a planet. You know Pluto deserves it, he after all was a planet for quite a while. Then one day a bunch of stuck up scientist with their high and mighty positions decided enough was enough. Pluto had it too good for too long. I mean of course he sat on the edge of our solar system, I mean he is just a shy guy you can't take it out on him, and just because he is far away does it not mean he cannot hear us or have feelings. Right now you know his family has out casted him and he is on the verge of suicide. AND WHAT FOR? WHY? EVERYTHING WAS FINE WHEN PLUTO WAS A PLANET.

												Psychonauts is my favorite game (so far :P). It is an action platformer about a ten year old psychic named Razpution AKA Raz. This game is mainly story based with puzzle solving, a simple fighting system, and platforming. This game has a few bugs, bad camera angles (occasionaly), and not so great graphics, but this was a PS2 and X-Box game so it didn't bother me to much. This game offered serveral different psychic abilities and unique boss fights. Psychonauts contained my favorite video game levels of all time, the milkman conspiricy. I was also still able to play and enjoy this game with a PC that does not run the best with games. Overall I give this game 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Without a doubt, one of the best 3D platformers out there, with great control and a lot of humour to it. The game's levels are challenging and sometimes a bit frustrating, but the incredible atmosphere, likeable characters, and twisted sense of humour makes clearing each level all the better. It's also one of those rare 3D platform games that plays very well without the use of a controller, though I'd still suggest using one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For the first game of Double Fine to be released, I'd say this one was a great starting point. Unique story, creative worlds, amazing characters, and a beautiful musical score can show how great this game truly is. However, slightly stiff controls and a weird camera can ruin the game, and most of the side quests are just incredibly long collect-a-thons. However, if you enjoy a good mind-dive, then this is a game I'd recommend. Just don't drink the milk.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An excellent  and original game, even by Double Fine standards. Psychonauts has you playing as a 10-year old psychic at a psychic summer camp/government training facility. Dialogues are an absolute riot, the puzzles are interesting and the combat is varied enough to be fun. Level design is perhaps the game's greatest strength, you will visit mind-worlds as diverse as the people (and creatures) they belong to, with every world having different mechanics, which saves the game from becoming grindy. Pick it up and you will not be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Maybe I might be nostalgia tripping, but Psychonauts takes everything good from great games like Banjo-Kazooie and Super Mario 64 and does it much better. It is a very well fleshed out game, if you can get with the very unique artstyle. At any rate it is a much better story telling game, than the aforementioned - going into darker jokes and providing better context for levels with actual plot motivations. It is a great game of it's class, definitely worth trying out. My only gripes, was having to adjust the controls for mouse and keyboard, and that the collectables are flat-alpha-ed planes that are very easy to miss when looking at them from the wrong angles.

												Its a game by Tim Schafer game. If that doesn't sell you, then I guess I'll have to talk about the game.Psychonauts is a platformer that has collectathon elements, powers, and a ranking system, as well as a large hub world. The main chunk of the game and gameplay takes place inside the minds of individuals around the psychics' camp,calling Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp.The characters are the best part of this game. This game is amazing in every aspect, but the characters are easily the best part of it. They're quirky, they have their own permanent personalities, they have backstories told through slideshows within that person's level, they are full of life and are portrayed so well by their respective voice actors that you never get the sense that they're people in a room recording lines of dialogue, you get immersed into the world of the psychonauts and the characters slowly have their affect on you. They also teach you valuable life lessons (for instance, control over emotions and saying that you cannot lock it completely away, or you'll explode inside Sasha Nein's marksman training). Honestly, the rest of the game works as well as any other decent 3D paltformer/collectathon, and I can't help but comparing it to Conker's Bad Fur Day, but with fewer curse words. It functions well and would otherwise not stand out, but because of its writing and its characters (and in Psychonaut's case, its art style too. CBFD looked a lot like Banjo & Kazooie). Its powers are neat and the premise is certaintly unique, but the characters really bring this game to life.Double Fine Productions are similar to Vigil games, as many of their games are huge cult classics, that weren't huge at their release, but have over time garnered a huge following. I just hope Double Fine doesn't go the way of Vigil.Overall, I highly recommend it to any 3D platforming fan. Its quirky, it pokes fun and its overall a blast to play. 10/10 from me, Double Fine. I cannot wait for Psychonauts 2 to come out in...2018, supposedly...I just hope its worth the wait and meets expectations			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So this was a game that's been present in my life some way or another for quite some time, to the point where I had 3 copies of it, but only in this year, 2013, did I sit down and dedicate the time to play it. It was better than I could have possibly imagined. Sure, I played the most updated version on the Mac, so it was cleaner looking and probably controlled smoother, but it felt so good for a game that by all rights should have aged a lot more. And the ideas! Oh my. It's unprecedented for a platformer to have convincing reasons for why you can't swim or the MC's uncanny ability to swing from ledge to ledge so elegantly.I felt it struggled along and got pretty frustrating throughout the overlong tutorial section of the game if you don't know what you're doing, but nothing has payed off so much so fast. From the time I entered Lungfishopolis and all the way through the Asylum levels, I just never wanted to stop playing.And I never wanted it to end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished the game (59% of the achievements only) and it took 19 hours gameplay. But seriously, i had a lot more fun playing this than i had with other games that took 80 90 hours of my life or more. It has an excellent storyline, interesting and unique characters, and we get many really good laughs. It's not the kind of dumb humour that is spreading everywhere these days, they are very smart jokes. The team that made this game focused on giving you the best experience possible and not make you waste time doing redundant quests. The only time i had to ""farm money"" was to get an item that would be useful for getting mental cobwebs, helping rank up and get better skills. That took me 10 15 minutes farm max, all the other 18 hours of gameplay was me playing the storyline, and those 15 minutes made me explore a lot of the open world of the game and find some cool stuff.I want psychonauts 2. By crowdfunding they managed to start the project and I will make sure I buy it the moment it is launched. Support quality gaming and not ""waste time"" gaming. One of the best 20 hours i played in  a game, and i will start again to get all the achievements. Wish you a great day, and thanks for reading this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Money well spent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands-down favorite game.Psychonauts is built on an incredibly unique concept: using psychic abilities to explore the minds of others. Literally, explore. Walking around in them.Characters are infinitely entertaining, plot is engaging and hardly predictable, mechanics are smooth and uncomplicated.Atmosphere is unlike any other, in part due to the characteristic art style of the game. Levels are kind of short, but perfect length to keep the story moving so that you're not spending too much time in either the meta-world or the minds of others. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It had been a while since I played the original PS2 Psychonauts and beat it, possibly a couple years at most. Since I beat it I always had that elusive Rank 101 in mind, having only gotten somewhere around 70-90. Now that I rebought the game I spent a good three consecutive days hunting everything down and getting the ***** to display my name and call me a psychomaster. It got a little frustrating from time to time when I couldn't find the last collectable in a few worlds as they hid in plain sight, but overall... I liked the game. I kinda wished that some of the characters were a little more fleshed out, but for what it is I enjoy it. If you do play this game, don't just rush through it (Unless your goal is to go fast). Instead, take your time and explore the world a few times, you might witness things you didn't expect. Getting all the achievements on Steam really showed me how much of this game I didn't see before. So many new things to do and learn about that my mind was boggled by the sheer amount of stuff. Aim for the highest rank possible, but if you get stuck wondering how to do that *ONE* thing, or where the last collectable is... It isn't necessarily the best idea to get yourself worked up trying to figure it out. Okay, spoilers.SPOILERS TO SOME DEGREE:In the end, it ends up being a bit disappointing that there really isn't any... bonus, for Rank 101. You do get something for rank 100, but not 101. Well, you get the achievement but that's it. Not really worth it in my opinion, but I guess it's the journey that counts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember preordering this game at gamestop when it came out in 2005. I played the HECK out of this games. It's littered with awesome puns and clever jokes! It can be challenging (in a good way!), yet surprisingly fun and easy to understand and adapt to. The game play time isn't too bad. I'd say maybe a little under 21 hours if you were just focused on the story. But if you're interested in completeing the game in its entirety by doing every sidequest and collecting everything there is, maybe 48 hours tops. I remember there being a LOT to do in the game, figments, emotional baggage, etc. Lots of things to collect. I HIGHLY reccommend this game and I am not afraid to judge you if you don't buy it. :pP.S.My favorite part is the summoning bacon <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is truly one of the most unique platformers (should it even be called that though?) that I've ever played. The game may start out a bit slow and feel like any 3D platformer from the era, though once you start entering other peoples minds and exploring their mental worlds you'll start to notice just how different and unique this game is. Through great storytelling and voice-acting it manages to build up a great big world for you to explore with a huge variety between worlds.The music and graphics are also great and helps build up the atmosphere, though it feels a bit outdated.

												A hidden underated gemIf you are one of the people that love old school 3D platformers like Rareware games then you will love this game, there is alot of content to collect. One of the best aspects of the game is the HUGE difference between each level, one level you can be in a disco dance party and in another one you could be in the mind of a fish-people metropolis. The story is great and somewhat funny, it is interesting how everything is explained in the game's context, even extra lives make sense which is rare in videogames.Overall I think everyone should give this game a chance, specially if you are a platformer fan.

												This was...a truly wondeful game. Initially, I first came across Physconauts as a picture, one of those random pictures that sometimes appear on google images for some reason or another, intrigued by the oddball style of character design, I looked further into the game, and I was struck by it's capacity to keep you interested. The music for all stages reflected well not only upon the mind of who you were exploring, with each person's mind receiving a unique piece. The character designs are not based on traditional aesthetic values, but still create a diverse cast who, while a great many of them are barely mentioned in the actual plot, are prominent in the many little side affairs that make up camp life (which I found created a realisticness in a place where not too many would expect it). One of the main things I really liked about the game was the exploration factor, in that, the Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp proved a vast place to poke, jump, burn, and run around, in fact, a moderate chunk of late game fighting capacity relies on your exploration. Interestingly enough, Psychonauts doesn't rely on overt violence to keep you entertained, although there usually is mental censors of some kind to fight through as minor obstacles in most minds. Instead, you must explore through various places, figuring out how to best get around (One case being how to go up a street without being run over by a bull.) That isn't to say the boss fights aren't challenging. Far from it, as the boss fights I've encountered here, rely not on overt violence, but rather figuring out how to use various psychic powers to exploit the enemy's weakness and win from there. Combine this with amusing dialogue, jokes for all ages, and minor plot arcs which lead one to speculation about real life people based on fictional characters, and many other things which make the Game of Psychonauts a Must Play.

												Its a game by Tim Schafer game. If that doesn't sell you, then I guess I'll have to talk about the game.Psychonauts is a platformer that has collectathon elements, powers, and a ranking system, as well as a large hub world. The main chunk of the game and gameplay takes place inside the minds of individuals around the psychics' camp,calling Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp.The characters are the best part of this game. This game is amazing in every aspect, but the characters are easily the best part of it. They're quirky, they have their own permanent personalities, they have backstories told through slideshows within that person's level, they are full of life and are portrayed so well by their respective voice actors that you never get the sense that they're people in a room recording lines of dialogue, you get immersed into the world of the psychonauts and the characters slowly have their affect on you. They also teach you valuable life lessons (for instance, control over emotions and saying that you cannot lock it completely away, or you'll explode inside Sasha Nein's marksman training). Honestly, the rest of the game works as well as any other decent 3D paltformer/collectathon, and I can't help but comparing it to Conker's Bad Fur Day, but with fewer curse words. It functions well and would otherwise not stand out, but because of its writing and its characters (and in Psychonaut's case, its art style too. CBFD looked a lot like Banjo & Kazooie). Its powers are neat and the premise is certaintly unique, but the characters really bring this game to life.Double Fine Productions are similar to Vigil games, as many of their games are huge cult classics, that weren't huge at their release, but have over time garnered a huge following. I just hope Double Fine doesn't go the way of Vigil.Overall, I highly recommend it to any 3D platforming fan. Its quirky, it pokes fun and its overall a blast to play. 10/10 from me, Double Fine. I cannot wait for Psychonauts 2 to come out in...2018, supposedly...I just hope its worth the wait and meets expectations			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another unusual one.  The game has a good offbeat sense of humor, decent platforming sensibilities, a variety of skills and challenges to use them on, etc.  I'll also rate it up for having some amazingly memorable level designs.  If you've played it, you know immediately the ones I mean; if not, you should.  But the scavenger hunt aspects..  ye gods.  I like exploring and will go a bit out of my way if I see a secret and think I can get to it.  But if you were a completionist and wanted to 100% the game, the quantity of stuff would probably drive you mad.  And if you wanted nothing to do with collecting stuff, the requirement to do so in order to level up would leave you frustrated.All in all, though, quite solid and potentially a lot of fun, despite some frustrating parts.

Psychonauts is a masterpiece game that is what I refer to affectionatley as the ogre. MY GOD IT HAS LAYERS. Just when you think that you've done everything that you can do in this game there's the scavenger hunt, listening to stories, and finding all of the secrets really adds to the complexity under the surface and it's the true nature of this game. Part way through the game, it takes on a new personality and previous areas of the game can be unlocked certain ways. It's that reason why this game is so great. If you happen to be someone who's into finding secrets then this game iis for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts is my favorite platformer of all time, 3d or 2d.  Its the kind of platformer you can tell was developed by adventure game people.  And that combination hit a sweet spot.  The art, voices, pacing, variety, humor and mental health subtext is all pretty amazing as well. Definitely a classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished the game (59% of the achievements only) and it took 19 hours gameplay. But seriously, i had a lot more fun playing this than i had with other games that took 80 90 hours of my life or more. It has an excellent storyline, interesting and unique characters, and we get many really good laughs. It's not the kind of dumb humour that is spreading everywhere these days, they are very smart jokes. The team that made this game focused on giving you the best experience possible and not make you waste time doing redundant quests. The only time i had to ""farm money"" was to get an item that would be useful for getting mental cobwebs, helping rank up and get better skills. That took me 10 15 minutes farm max, all the other 18 hours of gameplay was me playing the storyline, and those 15 minutes made me explore a lot of the open world of the game and find some cool stuff.I want psychonauts 2. By crowdfunding they managed to start the project and I will make sure I buy it the moment it is launched. Support quality gaming and not ""waste time"" gaming. One of the best 20 hours i played in  a game, and i will start again to get all the achievements. Wish you a great day, and thanks for reading this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I picked up Psychonauts after consistently hearing it referenced as one of the best games ever by people in the games industry. I'm in complete agreement - this is now one of my favorite games. I laughed out loud more often here than in any other game. The level design and variety of art styles is excellent. Gameplay is generally very good and the various psychic powers are fun to play with.Downsides: A few levels and collectible quests can be somewhat frustrating due to precise timing requirements alongside slightly finicky controls (definitely take the time to remap the key/mouse actions as the defaults can be difficult to work with). Also, there comes a point late in the game beyond which you can't go back to the main game area to complete collectible quests or achievements.Two people in our house have put in 150 hours of play on this game. We're playing on a Mac and this version has been smooth and stable with no issues.Update: I was prompted to revisit this review as part of the Steam Autumn Sale 2016. My comments on the game remain valid except for the last paragraph. When we first played the game, it was made as a PC port inside a Mac ""wrapper"" (Transgaming, I think). This can be problematic for newer, more powerful games, but suited Psychonauts just fine. At some point, however, Double Fine decided to rebuild the game as a native Mac game. This can be a great thing for a game that doesn't work well in a wrapper, but in this case it made the game a lot worse - missing textures, stuttering, sometimes only marginally playable. Many of these issues were addressed over time, but as of the last time we played it was still inferior to the first release. At this point it's fixed enough that I wouldn't reverse my recommendation, just something to be aware of if you'll be playing it on a Mac.			",72,40,2,5,8,1,14

												Full Disclosure: This is one of my favorite games of all time.  I've already purchased a copy for just about everyone I know, and it's always first on my list whenever someone asks for suggestions for what to play next.I love psychonauts, and the Steam version of this game is the definitive version, in my opinion.  The addition of achievements and the graphical enhancements present in this port are fantastic, although i can honestly say you could play any version of this game and have a blast.The design of this game was from a time before ""photo-realistic"" games rose to prominence, and as such, even the modest graphical upgrades present here aren't really necessary.  can you still pick out where they put their resources? yes.  does it ruin the experience? not in the slightest.Psychonauts is one of the best examples of a genre that is only now beginning to see a resurgence: explorative, collect-a-thon action-platformers with heavy focus on unique worlds and eccentric characters.  These games were prominent in the N64/PSone and PS2/Gamecube era, and the fact that it took until 2015 to secure funding for a sequel is just criminal.long story short, I can't recommend this game highly enough.  While there are some joyless folk who don't like these sorts of games, if you have any fondness for this genre, or just fantastical adventures in general, do yourself a favor and pick this up.

												Psychonauts was created by Tim Schafer (creator or co-creator of Monkey Island 1&2, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, and Grim Fandango). It keeps the storytelling of his previous games while making the leap from adventure to platformer. Raz, a child circus acrobat with psychic powers, breaks into a psychic summer camp to hone his powers. He starts with just acrobatic skills. But as he learns new powers, he can float, bounce to higher areas, light things on fire, shoot laser beams, and much more (in typical Tim Schafer fashion, some powers can be used with humorous results). The story is excellent, the music (composed by Peter McConnell, composer or co-composer of such LucasArts classics as Monkey Island 2, Sam & Max Hit the Road, Day of the Tentacle, and Grim Fandango) is great, the art design is lively and it goes hand in hand with the varied level design, and the characters are fun and well voiced.

The quirky and fun graphics style has allowed the game to age well.  Replay value and deep characters make this game a must buy.  Get it to show Tim that we want a sequel!Edit: 11/27/16I replay this game at least once a year, and I am impressed every time at how well it holds up. The art is so stylized that it keeps the visuals beautiful despite aging graphics. The dialogues are so well written that I laugh at punchlines I've heard dozens of times.

												I got this game in the Humble Fine Bundle sale. Played the first three games that came in the bundle first and saved this one last. I haven't finished it, but what I can say is that this game is beyond any of my wildest dreams.Literally.I first fell in love with it because it felt like Banjo Kazooie. Then I fell in love with the characters and while the plot may be strange, I've fallen in love with it as well. In some strange and fantastic way, this game delves into the psyches of general people and mental patients in a way that I cannot fully express in words. It needs to be seen, and it truly is a shame that this game has sort of fallen under all of the big name titles out there because this is where it's at.

												This game is a must have for any fans of the classic Playstation 2 era 3D platformer (Ratchet & Clank, Jak, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger etc.). Much like its peers, Psychonauts features: a cast of funny and interesting characters; beautiful stylised graphics; solid, addicting platforming gameplay and an array of different psychic powers that serve to aid in combat and solve puzzles. The level and world design is fantastic. Each level takes place in the minds of different characters you meet where, as a Psychonaut in training, you must solve their inner turmoils. Every level offers a highly creative, memorable and varied world to explore, where you can collect various items - such as imiginary figments, mental cobwebs and emotional baggage - that upgrade your various powers and health and unlock background stories of the characters. My one criticism is that it suffers a bit from ""Collect-a-thon syndrome"" and some of the collectables are obscurely placed and have you scouring the map to find the ones you missed. The placement of a couple of the figments is downright evil and I required a guide to locate them but thankfully this was a rare occurance.I thoroughly enjoyed playing and 100% completing Psychonauts as it provided me a real throwback to one of my absolute favourite genres and I feel it holds up well against some of the heavyweights of mid 2000's 3D platforming. For some reason, Psychonauts never sold well when it was released so unfortunately I wasn't aware of this game until a couple of years ago but its Steam release has allowed it to sell a lot better recently and receive the attention it deserves. Psychonauts' recent rennaisance has meant Double Fine are now working on a sequel which I hope can recreate the imagination and creativity that impressed me so much in the original.N.B. I recommend playing with a controller. Mouse and Keyboard controls are alright but a controller is what this game is intended to be played with.			",22,0,0,2,0,0,1

												I got this game in the Humble Fine Bundle sale. Played the first three games that came in the bundle first and saved this one last. I haven't finished it, but what I can say is that this game is beyond any of my wildest dreams.Literally.I first fell in love with it because it felt like Banjo Kazooie. Then I fell in love with the characters and while the plot may be strange, I've fallen in love with it as well. In some strange and fantastic way, this game delves into the psyches of general people and mental patients in a way that I cannot fully express in words. It needs to be seen, and it truly is a shame that this game has sort of fallen under all of the big name titles out there because this is where it's at. If I haven't convinced you of anything, just remember these three words. ""The Milkman Conspiracy""			",215,93,5,17,11,2,14

												This game is a real treat to play it's a twisted but fun 3D platform game with a creative storyline and likeable characters The only problems I had with this game are pretty manor  firstly at the start of the game need a cobbwed duster and by that point you don't have enough arrow heads so you tediously run around the campground for arrowhead til you have 500 and I know it supposed to incourage the player to explore but to me it feels very forced and DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE MEAT CIRCUS ESCORT MISSION. Aside from those flaws the game is awesome with great music, epic boss battles and strange but inventive level design  I give this game a Solid 9.5/10 Fantastic			",162,20,3,14,5,2,3

												Psychonauts is a great game. Psychonauts has problems. The positives vastly outweigh the negatives.To get my issues with it out of the way first: - The platforming was difficult for me in parts prompting a lot of trial and error. This sounds like a small point but when the result is continuous repetition to make a  single jump it gets really annoying.- Some enemies were difficult/annoying to fight.- It's sad that you can't bind your powers to more buttons, as tabbing into the menu to swap powers out was just a little too much effort. It was released on the Xbox at the same time so you can see why this was done.Okay now onto the positives:- The story, the environments you find yourself in, the characters and the dialogue are all great. I can't stress this enough. The Steam trailer shows a range of levels of the game but it doesn't capture how excellent the dialogue and delivery is in this story where weird psychic kids go to summer camp.- The graphical style still holds up. For a game over 10 years old, it's not difficult to watch.- Collectibles matter. You level up almost exclusively through collectibles and several of them give you extra things to read/memories to watch. They're all very whimsically created and perfectly integrated into the game.- Some real thought has been put into it. Example: the main character Razputin gives a reason as to why he can't swim (that normal video game limitation). They mention it several times and justify it. Nothing is done arbitrarily, making for a very solid world.- It's a good length. Maybe 8 hours if you rush from place to place. Which you shouldn't do! Talk to as many other characters as possible, the dialogue is wonderful.It's so close to being a game I would say young kids should definitely play (or watch being played). However there are some words I'd call 'not okay' used, and a few moments spring to mind which could be really scary for kids. The comedy gets dark at times. Make your own judgement if you're in that situation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The humor is great, the characters are all interesting, the character designs are all interesting, the different levels are always unique and offer a lot of variety, and the gameplay is mostly solid. There's a few parts of really obnoxious platforming and I think the final boss is a little too easy, considering the level you had to play to get to it.

												Psychonauts is a game that stands on its setting. First off, the environment is wonderfully designed. The setting is a summer camp for psychics, and the everyday beauty of nature is distorted by the childlike playfulness ofthe supernatural elements. Boardwalks don't just wind down forest paths, but undulate through space, twisting and turning like something out of a Tim Burton film. The characters are engaging and bizarre, their quirks lovingly detailed, both in appearance and characterization, making everyone unique. There are no generic ""background characters"" in this game; every character has a backstory, a personality, and their own plot that winds through the narrative of the game. Once you get into the mechanics, however, there are some problems. There are some control issues, and most of the challenge comes, not from the game, but trying to marshal the controls into doing what you want, rather than actually using them to accomplish goals. The only other blemish on the face of this otherwise wonderful game is that the leveling is a bit grind-y, and centered around a series of scavenger hunts, rather than actual gameplay. That said, I feel that a traditional ""Combat->XP"" system would not have worked with this game, as combat seems to be something that happens when it has to, rather than a constant method of progressing through the game.In short, the play is a little slow and glitchy, but with the engaging setting, you won't mind it much.

												Psychonauts seems like a rather polarizing game in that some people seem to think it's pure gold and some people think it's awful. Which group you'll fall into depends on weather you're the kind person who can allow things like excellent story-telling and charming arti direction excuse a few minor gameplay issues, or if you're the kind of twitching, Ritalin popping, XBox owner who falls into a coma when they go without killing something for five seconds. I'm just going to list out of context some of the things that occur in Psychonauts: a telekinetic bear, a dentist who harvests brains instead of teeth, and a sequence wherein you become a giant  monster and terrorize a society of fish. A game that features all of these things simply cannot be criticized. It's against the law or something. Now so your next course of action should probably be to buy it if you haven't already.

												'Originality' is the adjective that will always be used when asked to describe DoubleFine in one word, and Psychonauts is no exception. It is an action/adventure, open-world with a very strange art style and very vague RPG elements game that focuses on the elements of the human mind and psyche, with psionics being the main theme. Name me one other game ever that involves that, or even better, name me one other game that does that better than Psychonauts. Impossible.			",181,37,0,19,24,0,22

												So this was a game that's been present in my life some way or another for quite some time, to the point where I had 3 copies of it, but only in this year, 2013, did I sit down and dedicate the time to play it. It was better than I could have possibly imagined. Sure, I played the most updated version on the Mac, so it was cleaner looking and probably controlled smoother, but it felt so good for a game that by all rights should have aged a lot more. And the ideas! Oh my. It's unprecedented for a platformer to have convincing reasons for why you can't swim or the MC's uncanny ability to swing from ledge to ledge so elegantly.I felt it struggled along and got pretty frustrating throughout the overlong tutorial section of the game if you don't know what you're doing, but nothing has payed off so much so fast. From the time I entered Lungfishopolis and all the way through the Asylum levels, I just never wanted to stop playing.And I never wanted it to end.			",205,108,2,50,23,1,34

												An excellent  and original game, even by Double Fine standards. Psychonauts has you playing as a 10-year old psychic at a psychic summer camp/government training facility. Dialogues are an absolute riot, the puzzles are interesting and the combat is varied enough to be fun. Level design is perhaps the game's greatest strength, you will visit mind-worlds as diverse as the people (and creatures) they belong to, with every world having different mechanics, which saves the game from becoming grindy. Pick it up and you will not be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And the level design, wow, I feel like they really got it spot on, and the world i full of these little secrets which,  sometimes may be burning children, but the rest are all good...The main reason I got this game was because I heard NerdCubed talking about, and 'cause it was on sale *cough cough, but it was really great and you dont often see many games like this. Just get it, but look out for those silly old milkmen/spie/wtf/idk guys, they just cant stop talking about there lives. and boobs. ",88,11,3,10,4,1,2

												If you’re interested in children, magic, and camps surrounded by tall fences ruled by a dictator, then you are most likely a perverted Nazi. However, If you’re interested in children, magic, and camps surrounded by tall fences ruled by a dictator, then you are a completely normal person and you will enjoy this game with a passionate passion.  In this game you spend most of your time in peoples minds uncovering the lost secrets of their pasts, and while doing so you can collected a bunch of weird chalk drawings that do nothing besides destroy the OCD part of you. These chalk drawings will consume your life, soul, and bodily fluids as at first they are easy to spot giving you a false sense of accomplishment. This easy peasy mindset lasts until the last one where you have to jump across the universe upside down on one leg blindfolded with a firecracker up your butt to get it. Since it’s the last one you have to get it, you're a gamer, OCD and completion run in your veins. Every fiber in your body is saying ""go on get the last chalk drawing"" but you must resist. IT IS FUTILE. You will never get that last chalk drawing just like how Pluto will never again be a planet. You know Pluto deserves it, he after all was a planet for quite a while. Then one day a bunch of stuck up scientist with their high and mighty positions decided enough was enough. Pluto had it too good for too long. I mean of course he sat on the edge of our solar system, I mean he is just a shy guy you can't take it out on him, and just because he is far away does it not mean he cannot hear us or have feelings. Right now you know his family has out casted him and he is on the verge of suicide. AND WHAT FOR? WHY? EVERYTHING WAS FINE WHEN PLUTO WAS A PLANET. OBAMA WASN'T PRESIDENT, TWINKIES WERE STILL AROUND, AND NELSON MANDELA WAS STILL ALIVE! NELSON MANDELA!!			",61,8,0,2,3,0,5

												This game is awesome! Graphics at Pc are nice and the story ,the characters are very good. The character models at first seem a bit awkward, but you get used to it really fast. It's a nice little story and it has a bit harder than normal gameplay the further you proceed to the story. It's good that you can backtrack through the Tumbler Experiment , and it's also good that there are mutiple saves. All in all, I would recommend it to anyone looking for an experience unlike those of newer games ,with all flashy actions and stuff. It is a bit childish, but you quickly realise that there are some dark secrets inside the game,once you start collecting memories and stuff. It really hit me in the face sometimes.

												1) Essential purchase2) Recommended purchase3) Recommended purchase during a sale4) Not recommended unless heavily discounted5) Not even recommended for Steam game collectorsLooking for something different? This 2005 classic never seemed to get the love it deserved. I've only now gotten to check it out, but its got me hooked from the start. You play as Razputin (voiced by Richard Horvitz, VA of Zim, Billy, Pox, and Orthopox from Invader Zim, Billy and Mandy, and Destroy all Humans respectively) who has snuck away from his circus home to participate in a summer camp for psychics. I hear you thinking: ""Psychics? Does that mean puzzles?"" To which I say, nay! It means platforming! Literally enter the minds of your victi- er, volunteers, and journey through their mindscapes to learn of their pasts and uncover the horrible truth of the camp. Double Fine isn't known for good gameplay, and while its not the greatest here, I think its deserving of a try.Sounds fun, right? Well it is, but it is not without fault. If you're a stickler for graphics you may be dissapointed in the fairly low budget visuals in this ten year old game, but the atmosphere and mood are set very well. My one complaint are the boss battles, of which you get one every hour or two (at least for the first six hours, which is what I've done at the time of writing). They rely on a simple dodge-wait for weak spot to be exposed-spam attack-repeat formula which is never mixed up very much.The story, I feel, is pretty good. Its nothing spectacular and I can't say much without spoiling, but I'm enjoying it.All in all, check this game out if you have interest in Double Fine, clever/trippy visuals, platformers, or horror movies.NOTE: At some point in the game there's an underwater section where you totally lose control of the camera. Near the end of it the camera bugged so Raz was almost never onscreen. Reset your resolution to 800x600 and die a few times to go back a checkpoint. This fixed it for me.			",135,31,1,10,14,3,9

												Psychonauts is a rather obscure game, let's start there.You are Raz, a ten-year-old boy with psychic abilities at a summer camp for psychics, and it's your job to become a Psychonaut before your dad picks you up from camp. Sounds bad? Oh, you just wait.Considering this is a 3-D platformer, I'll start at the platforming then. Unless your computer is complete poop and you lag on everything (even Microsoft Word, yes, I know. Soak in the badness) the response you get from jumping, climbing and...uhh...swinging around a pole and then launching yourself. Speaking of jumping, you can double jump.Moving on from jumping on platforms, combat is the other third of this game (the last third is the stages, or 'minds' as they refer to in-game, since your 'levels' are you travelling into other people's minds, most of the time solving an issue they have or getting a power-up). You have your basic 1-2-3 karate chop then force palm combo and your 'palm bomb', a smashing attack when, you guessed it, slam into the ground with your palm (surprising, I know). Now to mention the multiple merit badges you earn to use other abilities, like setting things on fire or turning invisible. This allows you to come up with your own tactics against all enemies, let alone have some fun with non-combat abilities, like Clairvoyance, haha, always a blast to use.(Oh god, that paragraph)Anyway, I've rambled on for long enough. SO LET'S RAMBLE ON MORE!Last, but definately not least, are the minds and psyche of the people you meet. Before I go in-depth and all, Edgar's mind, or Black Velvetopia, is my favourite mind, just so that's out of the way. Each level doesn't feel the same, and every mind has it's own theme, look and way to complete it. For example, in the very first stage, Coach Oleander's mind called 'Basic Braining', has you going through war, which in this case is a massive obstacle course. Might I add, even though this has nothing to do with the levels, is that the dialogue and humour in the game is absolute bliss.Sadly, we come to the bad parts of the game. Uhh, sometimes for me, at least, (even though this only happened to me at the end of the game) the controls will just kinda cut out, leaving you with a falling Raz and a loss of your astral projection layer in the current mind you're in. Or just thrown into a very inconvenient spot. Also, (and also only at the end of the game) the camera direction can be kinda irritating at times. As in, the kind of ""WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO GO?!"" camera. This rarely happens and is only for small segments. Finally, enemies that you have no idea how to beat. This is a personal complaint and you can say, maybe a stupid one. I'm talking about enemies, particularly bosses, that you have no idea how to beat and you're left with something kicking your♥♥♥♥♥and there's nothing you can do about it. This is the biggest complaint here, and you can make a counterarguement stating how that this is just learning the game. Yeah, it is, but without a walkthrough, it can be irritating at times.Now, before I go on about more tiny aspects, I'm gonna wrap up this review. This game is a beutiful blend of humour, tight controls, variety and lovable characters that combinates into the best platformer I have ever played, heck, it's definately my favourite PC game to date! Yes, I like it that much. So, unless it's completely obvious, do I like this game or not?Well of coarse I like this game! I recommend everyone with a sense of humour and a love for indie games. From me, an average gamer who just completed this game for the first time, gives this game a 9/10. It's amazing, easy to pick up and play, and hilarious to experience.~Horris			",28,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Best game ever. Well, I really liked it. Very, very funny.It's a 3D platformer with some very varied gameplay across a sequence of completely ridiculous scenarios: attend a disco party, destroy some hideous things, fight a giant mutated fish, rampage through a city as a giant, run with the bulls and fight over Carmen, play a war game against Napoleon, resolve a terrible conspiracy, and do lots of other silly things.

												Hands-down favorite game.Psychonauts is built on an incredibly unique concept: using psychic abilities to explore the minds of others. Literally, explore. Walking around in them.Characters are infinitely entertaining, plot is engaging and hardly predictable, mechanics are smooth and uncomplicated.Atmosphere is unlike any other, in part due to the characteristic art style of the game. Levels are kind of short, but perfect length to keep the story moving so that you're not spending too much time in either the meta-world or the minds of others. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A rare gem of a game, Psychonauts uses a sharp sense of humour and self mockery (similar to many Schafer games) to draw you in to an engaging story, filled with superbly absurd characters (all perfectly voice acted) and situations.The gameplay itself is addictingly easy and fun, but the game sets itself apart from other platformers with its diverse level design, reinventing itself with each new stage, while keeping a simple set of basic mechanics to navigate the often outlandish and ridiculous world.With each stage based inside a person's mind, Psychonauts is Burton-esque in its disregard for conventional standards, instead creating a dreamlike mish-mash of wild colors and music.  (The soundtrack really is worth it, you'll find yourself humming the various themes for hours after finishing a stage.)Though the graphics are dated, the gameplay and atmosphere is timeless, making this game a must-play for anyone who loves double-fine, james willems, or just good plain fun.  While it's undoubtedly worth the full price, this game often does go on sale for one dollar, so consider waiting for that. ",52,11,0,9,9,0,13

												Okay, so this is a really old game. Not as old as one would expect ""old"" to mean, but it was from the console generation involving the Gamecube.I do believe this surpasses many modern games in quality and enjoyability. Whilst there are the typical mistakes and glitches you can find in any platform/adventure game (to do with jumping, climbing and such), they have been nothing more than a minor inconveniance. Visual quality of the game is astounding. Whilst the game doesn't have the billions of polygons and pixels in textures you can find in newer games, they lip-synching is nearly always spot-on. That's a major plus for me. It makes the game seem all that more real.The story and level design are brilliant, too. You can expect a lot of dark humour as you travel through the minds of others in an attempt to get to the bottom of a devious plot. You'll have fun travelling, too. The different minds you visit provide a variety of levels. Pick it up and give it a try!			",333,69,6,42,18,5,57

												It had been a while since I played the original PS2 Psychonauts and beat it, possibly a couple years at most. Since I beat it I always had that elusive Rank 101 in mind, having only gotten somewhere around 70-90. Now that I rebought the game I spent a good three consecutive days hunting everything down and getting the ***** to display my name and call me a psychomaster. It got a little frustrating from time to time when I couldn't find the last collectable in a few worlds as they hid in plain sight, but overall... I liked the game. I kinda wished that some of the characters were a little more fleshed out, but for what it is I enjoy it. If you do play this game, don't just rush through it (Unless your goal is to go fast). Instead, take your time and explore the world a few times, you might witness things you didn't expect. Getting all the achievements on Steam really showed me how much of this game I didn't see before. So many new things to do and learn about that my mind was boggled by the sheer amount of stuff. Aim for the highest rank possible, but if you get stuck wondering how to do that *ONE* thing, or where the last collectable is... It isn't necessarily the best idea to get yourself worked up trying to figure it out. Okay, spoilers.SPOILERS TO SOME DEGREE:In the end, it ends up being a bit disappointing that there really isn't any... bonus, for Rank 101. You do get something for rank 100, but not 101. Well, you get the achievement but that's it. Not really worth it in my opinion, but I guess it's the journey that counts.			",48,11,1,17,3,0,5

												Another unusual one.  The game has a good offbeat sense of humor, decent platforming sensibilities, a variety of skills and challenges to use them on, etc.  I'll also rate it up for having some amazingly memorable level designs.  If you've played it, you know immediately the ones I mean; if not, you should.  But the scavenger hunt aspects..  ye gods.  I like exploring and will go a bit out of my way if I see a secret and think I can get to it.  But if you were a completionist and wanted to 100% the game, the quantity of stuff would probably drive you mad.  And if you wanted nothing to do with collecting stuff, the requirement to do so in order to level up would leave you frustrated.All in all, though, quite solid and potentially a lot of fun, despite some frustrating parts.

												What can I say? This game was a cult classic when it was released in the twilight of the Xbox in late 2005.  Psychonauts is a masterpiece game that is what I refer to affectionatley as the ogre. MY GOD IT HAS LAYERS. Just when you think that you've done everything that you can do in this game there's the scavenger hunt, listening to stories, and finding all of the secrets really adds to the complexity under the surface and it's the true nature of this game. Part way through the game, it takes on a new personality and previous areas of the game can be unlocked certain ways. It's that reason why this game is so great. If you happen to be someone who's into finding secrets then this game iis for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts is a classic. While often described as a platformer it really is just another way for Tim Schaeffer to tell a story as he always has, this time through a hub world action platformer rather than a point-and-click adventure. As confident and compelling protagonist Raz you explore the minds of others to learn more about yourself all the while building and adding new psychic powers to your repertoire. If you like action and adventure with some platforming thrown in Psychonauts will gladly scratch that itch and have you coming back for more. With full controller support and achievements this is a must own for any Steam gamer.			",1358,429,35,125,161,7,201

												A rare gem of a game, Psychonauts uses a sharp sense of humour and self mockery (similar to many Schafer games) to draw you in to an engaging story, filled with superbly absurd characters (all perfectly voice acted) and situations.The gameplay itself is addictingly easy and fun, but the game sets itself apart from other platformers with its diverse level design, reinventing itself with each new stage, while keeping a simple set of basic mechanics to navigate the often outlandish and ridiculous world.With each stage based inside a person's mind, Psychonauts is Burton-esque in its disregard for conventional standards, instead creating a dreamlike mish-mash of wild colors and music.  (The soundtrack really is worth it, you'll find yourself humming the various themes for hours after finishing a stage.)Though the graphics are dated, the gameplay and atmosphere is timeless, making this game a must-play for anyone who loves double-fine, james willems, or just good plain fun.  While it's undoubtedly worth the full price, this game often does go on sale for one dollar, so consider waiting for that. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Full Disclosure: This is one of my favorite games of all time.  I've already purchased a copy for just about everyone I know, and it's always first on my list whenever someone asks for suggestions for what to play next.I love psychonauts, and the Steam version of this game is the definitive version, in my opinion.  The addition of achievements and the graphical enhancements present in this port are fantastic, although i can honestly say you could play any version of this game and have a blast.The design of this game was from a time before ""photo-realistic"" games rose to prominence, and as such, even the modest graphical upgrades present here aren't really necessary.  can you still pick out where they put their resources? yes.  does it ruin the experience? not in the slightest.Psychonauts is one of the best examples of a genre that is only now beginning to see a resurgence: explorative, collect-a-thon action-platformers with heavy focus on unique worlds and eccentric characters.  These games were prominent in the N64/PSone and PS2/Gamecube era, and the fact that it took until 2015 to secure funding for a sequel is just criminal.long story short, I can't recommend this game highly enough.  While there are some joyless folk who don't like these sorts of games, if you have any fondness for this genre, or just fantastical adventures in general, do yourself a favor and pick this up.

												This game is a must have for any fans of the classic Playstation 2 era 3D platformer (Ratchet & Clank, Jak, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger etc.). Much like its peers, Psychonauts features: a cast of funny and interesting characters; beautiful stylised graphics; solid, addicting platforming gameplay and an array of different psychic powers that serve to aid in combat and solve puzzles. The level and world design is fantastic. Each level takes place in the minds of different characters you meet where, as a Psychonaut in training, you must solve their inner turmoils. Every level offers a highly creative, memorable and varied world to explore, where you can collect various items - such as imiginary figments, mental cobwebs and emotional baggage - that upgrade your various powers and health and unlock background stories of the characters. My one criticism is that it suffers a bit from ""Collect-a-thon syndrome"" and some of the collectables are obscurely placed and have you scouring the map to find the ones you missed. The placement of a couple of the figments is downright evil and I required a guide to locate them but thankfully this was a rare occurance.I thoroughly enjoyed playing and 100% completing Psychonauts as it provided me a real throwback to one of my absolute favourite genres and I feel it holds up well against some of the heavyweights of mid 2000's 3D platforming. For some reason, Psychonauts never sold well when it was released so unfortunately I wasn't aware of this game until a couple of years ago but its Steam release has allowed it to sell a lot better recently and receive the attention it deserves. Psychonauts' recent rennaisance has meant Double Fine are now working on a sequel which I hope can recreate the imagination and creativity that impressed me so much in the original.N.B. I recommend playing with a controller. Mouse and Keyboard controls are alright but a controller is what this game is intended to be played with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts was created by Tim Schafer (creator or co-creator of Monkey Island 1&2, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, and Grim Fandango). It keeps the storytelling of his previous games while making the leap from adventure to platformer. Raz, a child circus acrobat with psychic powers, breaks into a psychic summer camp to hone his powers. He starts with just acrobatic skills. But as he learns new powers, he can float, bounce to higher areas, light things on fire, shoot laser beams, and much more (in typical Tim Schafer fashion, some powers can be used with humorous results). The story is excellent, the music (composed by Peter McConnell, composer or co-composer of such LucasArts classics as Monkey Island 2, Sam & Max Hit the Road, Day of the Tentacle, and Grim Fandango) is great, the art design is lively and it goes hand in hand with the varied level design, and the characters are fun and well voiced. I can't recommend this game enough. If you haven't played it already, do so now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Then I fell in love with the characters and while the plot may be strange, I've fallen in love with it as well. In some strange and fantastic way, this game delves into the psyches of general people and mental patients in a way that I cannot fully express in words. It needs to be seen, and it truly is a shame that this game has sort of fallen under all of the big name titles out there because this is where it's at.

												With a cast of unique and memorable characters, great voice-acting and vivid level designs, this game is fun to both play and watch. Being partially a member of the platformer genre, the ""psychic levels"" don't necessarily play nice with the mouse-look controls and a convoluted, unnecessary levelling mechanic had me scrounging aroud arrowheads, to purchase psy-cores to return to Ford's Sanctuary to combine with psi-cards to create psi-markers... Or I guess you could just go around and collect figments to level much faster and simpler without getting side-tracked from the main campaign. The control scheme is also not obvious if you leave the game alone for a while after the tutorial. At one point, I pulled up a walkthrough to figure out how to open my backpack! Felt like an idiot when I saw how close I was to doing it.While I'm still not finished and my opinion of the game may change, its problems have not increased since the beginning but its strengths have gotten better as I unlock new abilities. I still worry about how much the difficulty will ramp up as it's not clear how much success I have is due to pressing the correct buttons and how much is due to forgiving, kid-friendly levels. The first boss was appropriately challenging though so I'm not too worried.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most original takes on an ""action/adventure game"" I have ever played. And it's funny.Boiled down to its component pieces, Psychonauts is a platformer that involves running, jumping, swinging, climbing, exploring, punching, and powering-up your abilities.Beyond that, it's a funny, highly entertaining, engaging, and rewarding game that could really do with a sequel. The characters and story have enough twists to keep you interested, the comedy provides light relief before, during, and after the game's challenges appear, there are plenty of treasure hunts and side-missions to keep you busy, and the flavour of the gameplay changes often enough to pique your interest.

It was having so many different abilities and worlds to use and interact with.  I've finished the game in just over 16 hours, and it was definetely worth the purchase.  I made the mistake of ocassionally rushing through parts of the storyline, which I now regret, but I was extremely happy to hear that Psychonauts 2 was crowdfunded.The really does display the complexity and the beauty of the mind.  It very intricate and give a myriad of powers and dozens of settings to utilize them in.  The graphics and great, and story line was both funny and entartaining.

												Well I have to say, this an excellent game. I would highly recommend it to anybody. Unfortunately, for me I didnt like the layout or style. This was not my taste. It runs fantastic on my crappy laptop. I would wait for this to go on sale. However you need to play this game sometime. Thats my review. Even though I did not like it, I would recommend this to anybody like to spend thier money well. If you love platformers, get this game. If not, it will bore you. I love the games humor though.

												Quirky, fun game. Art style is nice, pacing is great, and the playstyle is fun. There are of course a few graphical and game glitches, but so far nothing game breaking, just a little silly looking. What can you expect from a somewhat older game?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well written and very well done the game possess an amazing quality rarely seen these days. It plays out as both an adventure and platformer as the dialogue and plot  pull you towards raz and his buddys in his psychic summer camp while the platforming thou simplistic is done well enough to keep the player interested through the game as you push to see what else is in store. Ultimately the game is more movie-esque than anything as it gives off a quality of an old kids movie loaded with slightly more adult innuendo and charm than it should.

												One of the greatest games of all time. Buy it now and enjoy it for the rest of your life.Yeah, it's that good. I love this game. Gaming perfection? Pretty much.Pros:- Great levels. Some of the most unique and great levels in video game history- Collection items are a blast. I am not a fan of collecting items, but this game makes it so much fun.- Hilarious story and characters. Wow, games rarely are this funny. It's amazing- Pure 100% joy and happiness. Games should make us smile, laugh, and enjoy the experience. This game does that X10.- Countless hidden secrets and gems. If you just play through without trying everything, you are missing out. Hint: Use Clairvoyance on everyone and everything. Always a laugh.- Looks great in HD. Works with wired Xbox 360 controller. Looks like it came out recently despite being 10 years old.Cons:- Meat Circus is still hard, even patched to be easier. I beat the PS2 version and it was a lot harder. Still, kind of annoying. Seriously, though it's nothing significant. 10/10100/100Buy it now.  Pledge your money to a sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game is my favourite for multiple reasons, one being that the story and gameplay and another for it's comedy and appeal.In short, if you have not bought this game already, you need to do it right now. It is past the worth of only $10 and it will give you hours upon hours of entertainment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

★★★★☆I'll be honest, this game didn't quite click with me, but I'd still recommend it to anyone. For starters, the game is developped by a studio that was never particulary big and got a lot of public attention because of this game. Rightfully so, because the world-, game- and characterdesigns of this game are extremely memorable to say the least. It has something like the Tim Burton movie 'Nightmare on Christmas' but colorful. It has a good amount of humor (that did not always click with me) and a charm that will make a lot of people make in love with it. The devs spent a lot of money on spoken dialogue and designing the world -some parts you even don't have to see to finish the game - which I can only appreciate and applaud to.It also isn't a run-of-the-mill platformer, as you don't always progress over a landscape by running from start to finish, but instead run around and replace objects, like delivering a letter to a character. It's not revolutionary at all, but it will pull the player into the world because it requires attention/thinking.For me, that caused some pacing issues. At times it felt like I was on a roll, at other times it felt like I got stuck only because I didn't know I could interact with a particulary object. I also exprienced a drag after the first level, as I found myself wandering almost aimlessly in the forest, collecting feathers and talking to characters about nonsenses. It was pretty straight forward before, but than suddenly it asked me to explore on my own.Some players might appriciate this, but to me this was kind of jarring.However, in a lot of cases the player is covered with good intell that you can collect at anytime to use 'bacon' to 'phone call' your superior in the game to simply ask to what you should do. All this is voice-acted and well-done.Jarring is also the word I would use for the crazy amount of collectibles. I tried to collect them all early game, but I soon felt distracted by them and got eventually bored with it since there are sometimes over 200 of them in 1 level. So achievement hunters beware: this might feel like a boring job to you.I also didn't like the voice acting that often, since a good amount of characters in the game have a childish high-pitch voice. This was extremely grindy in the theater level and especially annoying in one of the last levels where a kid would yell every 2 seconds because some enemy was hitting him. In this same frustrating sequence, you had to get to him asap by performing some divers platforming. I mistake, and you fall down, unable to get to the kid in time, forcing you to redo the same 2-5 minutes. Luckily, the is the only part of the game where I thought the game truly wasn't fun to play.Having said that, I generally think that level design isn't that great. It's no Mario game, but it does have some small issues. Oddly enough I felt like I cheated through some parts as I was using the 'ball jump' to get to higher places, skipping some ladders along the way. It was like the level designers had other intentions, before they knew about what the actual control scheme would really look like. Oh, on a side note: in the last level the double jump didn't always work for me, which was in this case infuriating.It's right if you'd say that the above points sounds like nitpicks to you, but to me they were more in my way of enjoyment of the game than I wanted it to be. In the end, this game felt like it wasn't really for me. However, I can tell it's a nicely polished game with some well-thought out parts in it, that I can recomment this to anybody. Pick it up during a Steam Sale, since often times it's discounted for 1 buck. That's a steal!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have a love-hate relationship with developer of Psychonauts, Double Fine. They have this incredible talent to create the most intriguing concepts and amazing characters for their games. Honestly, it's why I keep playing them. The previous Double Fine projects I had played were point-and-click adventures, so I was looking forward to experiencing their take on a different genre. I wasn't disappointed, as Psychonauts has to be one of their best games--even 11 years after its original release.Don't get me wrong, Double Fine's other games are great. They all have solid stories and gameplay, and dialogue is practically the developer's niche. However, there's one problem I have with their formula that seems to carry over into each of their games, and that's the ridiculously difficult puzzles. You can call me stupid if you like, but I have the hardest time with Double Fine's brain teasers--I've yet to play one of their games without a guide. Psychonauts doesn't quite suffer as badly in this respect, because the game's focus leans toward platforming. That being said, there were still many times I had look up where to go or what to do, because any hints I was given were so vague. Granted, a lot of this complaint is formed by my own impatience, but the problem is still there regardless of how my own shortcomings blows it up. With that gripe out of the way, there's plenty of room for a shower of praise, because Psychonauts is amazing. It reminded of a time when I was a kid playing Ratchet & Clank on my now broken PS2. It has this amazing sense of humor that can have you laughing out loud at one moment and face-palming the next. I love experiencing these jokes and thinking how I never would have caught on to them in 2005. The characters have to be some of the most varied I've ever seen. The peculiar character models probably helps with that, but it's also how each individual's quirks and intricacies shine through the dialogue. Double Fine knows how to make unique characters, and I love it. However, while all the voices were great there were segments where they wouldn't shut up while you were performing some task, and it got aggravating.On that note, the music did the same thing on occasion. It sucks when you're stuck trying to figure out a puzzle and there's some obnoxious music blaring in your ears. Besides that the music was fine. It wasn't anything noteworthy such as in Grim Fandango, unfortunately. Finally, the gameplay is tight and easy to acclimate to. Progressing through the game will land you new abilities, though I tended to stick to a chosen three. What's nice is you can switch any of them out on the fly, meaning you can instantly adapt to any situation. The platforming is spot on as well. I had a blast jumping, floating and sliding around the levels. Sometimes there were some awkward designs that caused me some frustration but nothing to hurt my experience too badly. There's also a surplus of collectibles to find and turn in. Doing so gives you bonuses and even some insight into some of the characters' backstories. I can see myself someday returning to Psychonauts to collect everything I missed. I can't stop playing Double Fine games. My first was Broken Age, which was a severe disappointment (because of the second half). Then I gave Grim Fandango a try, and I loved it. Now I've played Psychonauts, and I'm incredibly glad I did. I wish I'd experienced as a kid, but it's better late than never. Seriously, if you enjoy a platformer adventure with a colorful cast and great gameplay, then look no farther than Psychonauts.

												It's the Psychonauts that you've always known and loved, complete with the original premise, pleasing design and legitimately funny humour. Laugh as you play the game. Cry as you attempt to collect all the figments.Some minor changes from the Xbox version include the infamous Meat Circus level having its difficulty lowered (you now have infinite lives, though I still advise staying away from children for at least 48 hours afterwards as your murderous impulses lower), some minor graphical glitches and a keyboard and mouse control scheme that, while functional, doesn't really compare to using a gamepad. I advise using one as this game has native support, though it doesn't show the bindings. It's also worth noting that this game has full widescreen support (which includes the FMVs) and supports all the resolutions you think it would. It also has achievements, if you're into that. Freak.While not about to be remembered as a fantastic, ♥♥♥♥♥♥-inducing port, the source game is enough to make you cream yourself on its own merit. Play it! Or don't. I'm not about to steal your brain if you don't listen to me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the greatest games of all time. Buy it now and enjoy it for the rest of your life.Yeah, it's that good. I love this game. Gaming perfection? Pretty much.Pros:- Great levels. Some of the most unique and great levels in video game history- Collection items are a blast. I am not a fan of collecting items, but this game makes it so much fun.- Hilarious story and characters. Wow, games rarely are this funny. It's amazing- Pure 100% joy and happiness. Games should make us smile, laugh, and enjoy the experience. This game does that X10.- Countless hidden secrets and gems. If you just play through without trying everything, you are missing out. Hint: Use Clairvoyance on everyone and everything. Always a laugh.- Looks great in HD. Works with wired Xbox 360 controller. Looks like it came out recently despite being 10 years old.Cons:- Meat Circus is still hard, even patched to be easier. I beat the PS2 version and it was a lot harder. Still, kind of annoying. Seriously, though it's nothing significant. 10/10100/100Buy it now.  Pledge your money to a sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game, it's a shame I didn't find it until about 3 years ago. The story and characters are excellent, I love the level design (the most interesting I've seen in a game apart from some of the DmC(reboot) and they were enhanced by the story of every character) and the ♥♥♥♥ed up things that are in it. The gameplay is really good, the back stories for most characters were really interesting and loved that even if it looks for kids it contains really mature subjects.Raaz was one of the most relatable characters, found things weird and annoying when you did but at same time he was having the time of his life (like I did). The only criticism I have with the game is the camera, it's a 2005 so... I can forgive it but still it is annoying at some parts.For me is an excellent game and it deserves a 9/10 :).SPOILER ALERT!!!Loved the asylum part, specially the Milkman part haha one of the best levels I've played in any game. Also that easter egg with Clem and Crystal in the roof top... WTF?..  also that one Sasha made me pretty uneasy and then I saw the memories...♥♥♥♥♥♥..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best platform/adventure games I've ever played. Reminded me a lot of the awesome Rare days of Banjo-Kazooie, Conker and Donkey Kong 64. I'm not saying this game is like those, it certainly has the qualities of a platform game; jumping puzzles, collectibles, abilities that help you overcome new obstacles. But it executes those things in a way that is different from those other games.The game deals with psychic powers and travelling through the minds and dreams of others. You will get different psychic powers, some of which are awesome to use all the time, that will let you access different areas and overcome different enemies while travelling throuh the minds of people and dealing with their fears and issues which will transform into monsters that you will have to defeat.The story is hilarious, the characters are so cool and memorable, the Milkman comes to mind. The art style is pretty freaky, everything looks otherwordly and rightly so, as you will mostly be travelling the dreams inside the minds of your friends.I truly recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure games and weird, unique wrolds with very funny stories and characters.Do play with a controller, it is much more enjoyable in this game to do so.

The game itself is making me feel SICK because the gameplay DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE!!!

												Heard about this game getting a crowdfunding sequel so I thought I'd finally try it out and so far......This is the greatest game I had never played. Where have I been the last ten years?!It's extremely imaginative and hilarious. Filled with characters with lots of personality and charm. And the levels are so different, uniquely strange and brilliant.I can't believe it didn't sell very well when it came out, simply...mind boggling.Getting harder and harder to wait for the sequel; it's going to be amazing.

												I highly recommend psychonauts to anyone who is nostalgic for the 3rd person platformers of the 2000s.PROS:Every level is unique and well designed, and each introduces different gameplay mechanics, so the game never gets boring. The game is genuinely funny.It makes you care about the characters by making you help them through their problems, and showing you how they got those problems.Unique powers that are used in many different situations.It has puns.CONS:The upgrades didn't feel neccesary to complete the game.Since I didn't feel like the upgrades were neccesary I didn't try to get any of the collectibles, except for ones that added more to the story or raised my health bar.One level had alot of unskippable cutscenes that I had to watch multiple times.The final level seemed to hard, but the final boss felt really easy.But the pros do really outway the cons in this game, and I hope you check it out.P.S If ten dollars seems like too much to you, just wait for it to be ninety nine cents in every steam sale.

												This game has been on my radar ever since 2005, when it was released and I read the rave review my favorite video game magazine gave it. It seemed to have all these elements that were really up my alley - great humour, intersting characters and the crazy fun idea that you have to explore the mind of a bizarre band of misfits... So what took me 11 year until I finally got to play it? Well, that fact that it was a platformer. Somehow I got this image in my head, how all the fun that was promised to me was constantly interupted by awkward and repetitive jumping on tree branches and floating platforms... Boy, was I in for a surprise!... Of course the surprise wasn't about the humour, characters or the crazy ideas of the game... this is all in the package. The surprise was how ridiculously good the platforming is! From the moment you start the game the controls just fell so right... so responsive (provided you play with gamepad)! It's simply fun to traverse and explore the world. Actually this is the second ever game where I feel like finding all the collectibles (the first one being Trine) and belive me they are not in small numbers. To be honest the camera sometimes can get in your way, but for a 3d platformer that has to be expected.The other thing that really surprised me was how well the game has aged. I actually love playing the classics and have no problem going way back to the early 90s. But Psychonauts dosn't feel like an old game at all. It could have been released this year and I would feel like it needs to change a single thing. Also the great artstyle really helps it to stand the test of time. The only remark beeing that the cutscenes are noticeably lower res.So don't be like me, do yourself a favoir and don't wait another 11 year to play this great game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished this game a day ago and it's now easily one of my top ten favorite games.It has some warts, no doubt. The PC and Mac ports are a little finicky (at the time of this writing it's crashed a total of 8 times on me, and I had to unbind the camera controls on my controller because it kept pointing the camera directly up), the camera can be obnoxious and the final level is stupidly frustrating, but because of how amazing the rest of the game is you can easily forgive that.There's so much depth in the story and characters (told through a giant collect-a-thon, but that's mid '00's games for you) that it's easy to get lost in the strange world that Psychonauts takes place in. You'll drive yourself (aptly) insane trying to find all the figments just for that extra little morsel of story, and then you'll go back through the game AGAIN and pick up on little story hints that you missed the first time.The writing is excellent, thanks to Eric Wolpaw and Tim Schafer (say what you will about him, he at least knows how to write good dialogue), the gameplay holds up, and the characters are interesting and fun to interact with. If you missed out on playing this, this is a must-have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts... what can I say? It's a single-player platformer. You are Razputin (commonly known as ""Raz"") and you are a wanna-be Psychonaut! You take a summer camp which are for Psycadets to learn about being a Psychonaut, but no one really is interested in all this mojo stuff... except for you! You are very excited and pumped to be in this summer camp. You are living your cadet life normally until you dig deeper in the story and learn secrets about other people. The game has some RPG elements to it, with dialogues, leveling up system (kind of), etc. This game can get pretty bizarre after you've played it for some while. It gets REALLY weird, because you are a psychic and things are strange inside people's minds; especially if they're a MADMAN. Verdict: 7.5/10 stars. Just get it. It's worth it if you like a good platformer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's worth noting (if you're into achievements) that many of them are entirely missable, also that it goes dark part way through the game making finding stuff outside much harder and there is no free roaming after you finish the game so you will be wanting to grab everything as you go along. Having said that, exploring in between everything you do will allow you happen across many funny little things that deserve not to be missed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most creative game I have ever played.  I absolutely loved this game for many different reasons but I think my main readon for loving it is that it creates a rich and vibrant world for you to explore and investigate.  The characters are all distinguishable and I mean for god's sake the main evil guy is absolutely hilarious.  A dentist who removes brains I mean I wish I could come up with that.  There a about nine different psychic abilities that you get in the game and each one just as important as the others at some point.  Some you use more than others but each a joy to use.  The envirmonments are mainly different characters imaginations and each one is so unique making the experience believable and intriguing.  Environments outside the mind are also well done but the creativity shines when you enter a persons mind to battle their demons.  All in all the humor, story, environments, and gameplay are all fantastic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts is one of my favorite games of all time, and I'm glad it has finally come to Mac (and gotten Steam achievements)! This isn't the best platformer ever, but it's not bad. Combined with the various psychic powers you get throughout the game, it makes for a lot of fun. It's not super difficult most of the way through. (The final level is notoriously difficult, but supposedly they toned its difficulty back with the Mac release; I don't know yet, I haven't made it that far since the Mac release came out.)The graphics are a little dated now, but the art styles are very fun. Every mind is different with its own unique styles. It's also a very well-written game, story-wise. Be sure to take time to go through it; they've put in all sorts of little details, including ones I didn't even realize were in there until I had to go hunting for them from the achievements!

												A brilliant platformer that really surprised me. I had played Psychonauts briefly on PS2 but picked it up on Steam sale with the intentions of finishing it someday. After I started the game, I couldn't stop playing! The writing in Psychonauts is what sets it apart but the tight controls, varied level designs, and artwork are all great too. As you learn new psychic abilities, you'll use them to reach new areas but it doesn't feel like a locked off area akin to a Metroid or Zelda game. Anyone with an interest in how the world looks to other people and battles of the mind would love this game and it's worth the retail price easily!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts is a PS2-era action platformer. Developed by Double Fine and originally published by Majesco, it was released in 2005 for the Xbox, and 2006 for the PC and Playstation 2.It was reviewed well, but sold poorly, and has garnered a cult following. It's not an old game, but a lot has changed since it came out. Let's see how it holds up today.It stars the young wanna-be ""Psychonaut"" Razputin, commonly referred to as ""Raz."" Razputin sneaks into a camp for gifted children, (I know what you're thinking, and no. Not that kind. These kids have mind powers. Like, burning things. With their minds!) but is caught by the, uh, camp counselors, I guess. One of them looks like Resetti. Anyway, they want to send Raz home, but are unable to contact his parents. So they let him stay. And things start to get weird. Like, kids having their brains removed and walking around like zombies weird.The plot is good enough, won't win any awards, but it is charming and well written. The creativity behind the game is exceptional. Levels all take place in people's heads. Literally. Raz gets sucked into their brain through a tiny door. It's basically Extreme Makeover: Therapy Edition. You help people with their mental health, in the most fun way possible. No two levels are the same, just like people's minds. And just like the levels, the characters are great. Highlights include: A paranoid milkman, a heartbroken luchadore, a descendant of Napoleon with split-personality disorder, and a friendly psychic mutant angler-fish. Every character's level reflects their personality, and are all fun, different, and interesting.There's not much more to be said about Psychonauts without giving spoilers. This is truly one of those games that you are better off jumping in head first with reckless abandon. Don't look anything up about this game. You'll thank me later. I guarantee it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts is a beautiful game, but in a very special way. The way that the game has been put together and the story it tells is an artform in itself. The character design and level design mesh together in a way that isn't touched on by any other game, and there is so much to discover if you're willing to look around. The gameplay itself is fun, and the overall atmosphere is amazing. If you see this game on sale, I would not hesistate to pick it up to play. In fact, I would reccomend picking it up anyways!

The level design is nothing short of phenomenal, and the gameplay is really fun and different. Its also a game that is not afraid of throwing some challenges your way. (The F#*ing meat circus for instance) I seriously cannot understand why this game didn't sell that well the critics seemed to love it. Anyway this is worth so much more than ten bucks what are you doing buy it now. 9.3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is probably one of the best games I've ever played. It'll definitely be a favorite of mine for a long time, and I'm looking forward to the upcoming sequel.The game has a great art style, a great story, and an outstanding soundtrack. I especially love how the game makes clever use of symbolism in some of the levels such as a character living in a literally twisted reality or another character who is literally fighting a battle in his mind.However, it's not perfect. Controls can be a little clunky, especially when it comes to combat. On top of this, Psychonauts has plenty of platforming. Obviously, this isn't bad in and of itself. However, most platformers tend to follow one rule of thumb and it's this: Sooner or later, the difficulty will reach rage-inducing levels. Psychonauts is no exception.Also, some of the bosses can be a little rough. I mean, obviously. It's a boss fight, it's supposed to be rough. What I mean is, they sometimes don't make much sense. Like how some bosses seem to be immune to lasers, yet the very same boss's weakness is the typical melee attack.But don't let these things repel you from purchashing this title. It's a solid game and a wonderful gaming experience. Just be prepared to be a little patient with it as you draw nearer to the end.Also, if you're a completionist, make sure to use multiple save slots. The game has a ""Point of no return."" It does the Zelda thing where you can't save after the final boss, but it automatically saves after you cross this ""point of no return."" And that means that if you used only one save slot (like I did,) then you're stranded! You can't go back and get those achievements that you missed unless you start another playthrough.Then again, if you love the game as much as I did, you won't necessarily object to the idea of a second playthrough.

												Loved this. Awesome storyline, great environment, lots of fun stuff to collect. It's worth noting (if you're into achievements) that many of them are entirely missable, also that it goes dark part way through the game making finding stuff outside much harder and there is no free roaming after you finish the game so you will be wanting to grab everything as you go along. Having said that, exploring in between everything you do will allow you happen across many funny little things that deserve not to be missed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most creative game I have ever played.  I absolutely loved this game for many different reasons but I think my main readon for loving it is that it creates a rich and vibrant world for you to explore and investigate.  The characters are all distinguishable and I mean for god's sake the main evil guy is absolutely hilarious.  A dentist who removes brains I mean I wish I could come up with that.  There a about nine different psychic abilities that you get in the game and each one just as important as the others at some point.  Some you use more than others but each a joy to use.  The envirmonments are mainly different characters imaginations and each one is so unique making the experience believable and intriguing.  Environments outside the mind are also well done but the creativity shines when you enter a persons mind to battle their demons.  All in all the humor, story, environments, and gameplay are all fantastic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts is one of my favorite games of all time, and I'm glad it has finally come to Mac (and gotten Steam achievements)! This isn't the best platformer ever, but it's not bad. Combined with the various psychic powers you get throughout the game, it makes for a lot of fun. It's not super difficult most of the way through. (The final level is notoriously difficult, but supposedly they toned its difficulty back with the Mac release; I don't know yet, I haven't made it that far since the Mac release came out.)The graphics are a little dated now, but the art styles are very fun. Every mind is different with its own unique styles. It's also a very well-written game, story-wise. Be sure to take time to go through it; they've put in all sorts of little details, including ones I didn't even realize were in there until I had to go hunting for them from the achievements!

												A brilliant platformer that really surprised me. I had played Psychonauts briefly on PS2 but picked it up on Steam sale with the intentions of finishing it someday. After I started the game, I couldn't stop playing! The writing in Psychonauts is what sets it apart but the tight controls, varied level designs, and artwork are all great too. As you learn new psychic abilities, you'll use them to reach new areas but it doesn't feel like a locked off area akin to a Metroid or Zelda game. Anyone with an interest in how the world looks to other people and battles of the mind would love this game and it's worth the retail price easily!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts... what can I say? It's a single-player platformer. You are Razputin (commonly known as ""Raz"") and you are a wanna-be Psychonaut! You take a summer camp which are for Psycadets to learn about being a Psychonaut, but no one really is interested in all this mojo stuff... except for you! You are very excited and pumped to be in this summer camp. You are living your cadet life normally until you dig deeper in the story and learn secrets about other people. The game has some RPG elements to it, with dialogues, leveling up system (kind of), etc. This game can get pretty bizarre after you've played it for some while. It gets REALLY weird, because you are a psychic and things are strange inside people's minds; especially if they're a MADMAN. Verdict: 7.5/10 stars. Just get it. It's worth it if you like a good platformer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I highly recommend psychonauts to anyone who is nostalgic for the 3rd person platformers of the 2000s.PROS:Every level is unique and well designed, and each introduces different gameplay mechanics, so the game never gets boring. The game is genuinely funny.It makes you care about the characters by making you help them through their problems, and showing you how they got those problems.Unique powers that are used in many different situations.It has puns.CONS:The upgrades didn't feel neccesary to complete the game.Since I didn't feel like the upgrades were neccesary I didn't try to get any of the collectibles, except for ones that added more to the story or raised my health bar.One level had alot of unskippable cutscenes that I had to watch multiple times.The final level seemed to hard, but the final boss felt really easy.But the pros do really outway the cons in this game, and I hope you check it out.P.S If ten dollars seems like too much to you, just wait for it to be ninety nine cents in every steam sale.

												This game has been on my radar ever since 2005, when it was released and I read the rave review my favorite video game magazine gave it. It seemed to have all these elements that were really up my alley - great humour, intersting characters and the crazy fun idea that you have to explore the mind of a bizarre band of misfits... So what took me 11 year until I finally got to play it? Well, that fact that it was a platformer. Somehow I got this image in my head, how all the fun that was promised to me was constantly interupted by awkward and repetitive jumping on tree branches and floating platforms... Boy, was I in for a surprise!... Of course the surprise wasn't about the humour, characters or the crazy ideas of the game... this is all in the package. The surprise was how ridiculously good the platforming is! From the moment you start the game the controls just fell so right... so responsive (provided you play with gamepad)! It's simply fun to traverse and explore the world. Actually this is the second ever game where I feel like finding all the collectibles (the first one being Trine) and belive me they are not in small numbers. To be honest the camera sometimes can get in your way, but for a 3d platformer that has to be expected.The other thing that really surprised me was how well the game has aged. I actually love playing the classics and have no problem going way back to the early 90s. But Psychonauts dosn't feel like an old game at all. It could have been released this year and I would feel like it needs to change a single thing. Also the great artstyle really helps it to stand the test of time. The only remark beeing that the cutscenes are noticeably lower res.So don't be like me, do yourself a favoir and don't wait another 11 year to play this great game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts is a great game. Psychonauts has problems. The positives vastly outweigh the negatives.To get my issues with it out of the way first: - The platforming was difficult for me in parts prompting a lot of trial and error. This sounds like a small point but when the result is continuous repetition to make a  single jump it gets really annoying.- Some enemies were difficult/annoying to fight.- It's sad that you can't bind your powers to more buttons, as tabbing into the menu to swap powers out was just a little too much effort. It was released on the Xbox at the same time so you can see why this was done.Okay now onto the positives:- The story, the environments you find yourself in, the characters and the dialogue are all great. I can't stress this enough. The Steam trailer shows a range of levels of the game but it doesn't capture how excellent the dialogue and delivery is in this story where weird psychic kids go to summer camp.- The graphical style still holds up. For a game over 10 years old, it's not difficult to watch.- Collectibles matter. You level up almost exclusively through collectibles and several of them give you extra things to read/memories to watch. They're all very whimsically created and perfectly integrated into the game.- Some real thought has been put into it. Example: the main character Razputin gives a reason as to why he can't swim (that normal video game limitation). They mention it several times and justify it. Nothing is done arbitrarily, making for a very solid world.- It's a good length. Maybe 8 hours if you rush from place to place. Which you shouldn't do! Talk to as many other characters as possible, the dialogue is wonderful.It's so close to being a game I would say young kids should definitely play (or watch being played). However there are some words I'd call 'not okay' used, and a few moments spring to mind which could be really scary for kids. The comedy gets dark at times. Make your own judgement if you're in that situation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Must play game, I played it a long time ago, and enjoyed it thoroughly, don't let the graphical artstyle fool you, this game is rich in content. The newly added OSX support makes it a must for OSX users since its probably one of the better games available to you. The game is your standard action/adventure with a unique concept and fun cast of characters. Its price is very reasonable since you will easily get 10+ hours of enjoyment from this game. The only real downfall to this game is the control system which is downright atrocious at times. Still full recommendation on this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Progression is rather linear, but it is actually fun. Everything about the game is unique, from the art style to most of the abilities to the characters to the dialogue. Black Velvetopia especially is a beautiful piece of art. Wonderful game all around but is also has minor annoyances. For example, the mouse and keyboard combination takes getting used too and some parts of the game are down right infuriating with them. Small parts of stages have awful design (I'm looking at the Waterloo mainly). Found myself exploiting the hell out of levitation. Still, I highly recommend this game. NOTE: If you are using Windows 7, I recommend going to Psychonauts.exe > Properties and sticking it in Compatibility mode with Windows 95. The game up until Gloria's Theater ran fine, but then the graphics started messing up and the fps hit the fan. Doing the above fixed it and I encounter no issues past that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GET THIS GAME! You can enter crazy people's minds, and become a psychic agent. It's like X-Men mixed with Invader Zim.What powers does Razputin have? I don't know... how about the power of levitation!? How about MIND BULLETS?!Bacon is one of your items, and it helps with hints plus teleportations. Use it once you get it.This game is literally up there with Kingdom Hearts and Super Mario Bros. LITERAL BRAIN EXPLODING. In a good way.-_-I want a second game so bad... one where Raz has grown and has more adventures. With the rise of Let's Plays and Livestreams this game NEEDS sequels OR A CARTON ARGH! The ONLY reason i bought Broken Age and Brutal Legend was cause i figured it help fund Psychonauts 2. You wanna know how much i want Psychonauts 2? It is quite a lot!All I'd want is a similar setup as the first game, but with enhanced combat and acrobatics. Bonus points if several playable characters, multiplayer, and anything else.That's all, not much of an official review. Just wanted to say my thoughts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Must play game, I played it a long time ago, and enjoyed it thoroughly, don't let the graphical artstyle fool you, this game is rich in content. The newly added OSX support makes it a must for OSX users since its probably one of the better games available to you. The game is your standard action/adventure with a unique concept and fun cast of characters. Its price is very reasonable since you will easily get 10+ hours of enjoyment from this game. The only real downfall to this game is the control system which is downright atrocious at times. Still full recommendation on this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a brilliant game. It is 10$ but your money is not going to be wasted. If it is on sale, that makes it even better. I couldn't recommend this game enough.

Definitely no other game quite like it.  Very platform and puzzle heavy game.  With a sequel finally in the works this is absolutely worth buying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A Tim Schafer classic from back in 2005, Psychonauts still holds up in 2017. It's a surreal, hilarious romp through a fascinating world (both real and mental) with well fleshed-out characters and a solid story. At its core, the game is a platformer, also featuring many collectibles which become available once progression unlocks new abilities and items. Gameplay is tight and satisfying, and at around 10 to 12 hours the campaign doesn't wear out its welcome. With news of Psychonauts 2 being successfully crowdfunded, I'm excited to see how Double Fine can update this winning formula with new technology.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts is a 3D Platforming game that is very creative and fun! ... and pretty weird. If you really like 3D Platformers like in the good old days, you'll definitively like it! Oh and I don't know why, but when there's a sale, this game is like 2 or 3 dollars, so you can get a really good game for really cheap!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Platform games come in many shapes and sizes. There are the big-name platforming mainstays, such as Mario and Sonic, that rely on their own brand of rules and obstacles to overcome. You have the run-and-gunners, the hop-n-bops, the Metroidvanias, the collect-a-thons, those with realistic physics, the platform hells, the list goes on and on...However, there is a rare breed of platformer that comes out every so often that defies many of the traditional sub-genre aspects and manages to be it's own unique experience.Psychonauts is one of those games.The story of the begins with Raz running away from home to become a Psychonaut, a kind of mixture between a secret agent and mental projectionist. He is taken in by the training camp, set into a journey that has him entering mind after bizarre mind to solve a sinister brain stealing plot.With mental focus being the theme of the game, Raz learns many useful abilities such as levitation, telekinesis, and even seeing how others see the world. Upgrades and useful items are everywhere and the unique locals make the exploring the various mindsets to be all the more enjoyable. The humor is also some of the most well-written and goes hand-in-hand with the stylized look. One could easily picture a Nicktoon based on the game.Infamously bombing on it's intially release, it's earned a new life as time went on. For those looking for a unique 3D platformer on the PC, this is the first stop.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												---CONTAINS SPOILERS---4/5 ☆Having spent 30 odd hours on the game and finally unlocking all of the achievements, it's time for my honest opinion and review of Psychonauts.A fascinating game with a somewhat odd, edging on bizarre story - but that's what's so appealing about it. It's a great 3D platformer that can keep you going for hours if you want to do everything 100%, with plenty of collectibles and secrets to uncover. If you like games like Ratchet and Clank, you'll enjoy this one.The environments are vast and have plenty of exploration potential, some a bit more simple like the campgrounds and others considerably more complex like inside the minds of some of the characters you encounter, twisting and turning three-dimensionally around you. It's a great big basket of weird shaped fruit that you just want to dig into, fiddling and raising an eyebrow at each new stage's design and mechanics which in all comes together as a big ball of appealing 'wtf' that the game's story is in general. The music and sounds also help to fit in with this asylum theme of the game, they just seem to click nicely together and set the stage (pun quite literally intended in Gloria's mind) of that particular character's psyche, with the crazy and slightly disturbing nature of the last stage's music topping it all off. The story seemed to escalate quickly, going from training and learning about your psychic powers to suddenly thwarting an evil brain snatching plot to take over the world. I suppose it again adds to the bizzaro charm of the game. You encounter along your way people with multiple personae, anger issues, traumatic events and resentment and the like. I find that sort of stuff very fascinating, even more so how they managed to get it to blend together in a story as it did.It did however have it's fair share of negatives, though most are technical.Crashes for example are a big issue. Within my first couple of hours in the game I had several rather annoying crashes as I tried to make my way up to the Basic Braining segment. The message of 'Psychnoats is not responding and needs to be shut down' popped up a fair few times on my journey through the game. I advise anyone interested in playing this game to SAVE VERY OFTEN - which isn't a bad practice to get into the habit of doing so anyway for any game. There are also instances where the game 'freezes' but doesn't crash. Watch out for these, as you can still play the game, as long as you don't fidget with your keyboard or controller. Basically, the screen will freeze, but the music may still play. Give it a few seconds and it will start moving again. It usually stutters a bit before this happens (at least in my experience), a decent indicator to quickly hit the save button!Controls. You can play this game with a controller OR a keyboard and mouse. From the start, I would have preferred to use the controller, I believe given the type of game it is, it would have not only been easier to use a controller, but perhaps also more comfortable. However, there are teething issues with plugging in a controller. In my experience, it tended to crash MORE often when the controller was being used, and it had this strange issue where, even if you weren't touching the analogue sticks, Raz would start moving in a random direction, which also applied when operating the menus. I had to in the end unplug the USB receiver for the controller, shut down steam, re-launch and then play with the keyboard and mouse. There are fixes I believe out there via forums and guides, I believe there may be one or two on Steam's community forums, and you can work around them. But the player shouldn't really have to go looking elsewhere for third party fixes when it should have been checked and double checked before throwing it out there by the producers of the game. I used the default keybinds throughout the game, and they were ok, but did feel a bit clustered and clumsy at times. Whether that was my own fault or not is up for debate, but in a frantic battle situation, I found myself constantly hitting the wrong key for my psychic power, or something like Telekinesis cutting out halfway and accidentally dropping the thing or enemy you were engaging with. Things like this I believe would be considerably easier if you used a controller. But you can always change the keybinds to whatever you prefer.Now my biggest pain in the backside with this game. The camera. Oh my lord do I want to strangle that camera. It lets you down in places you need it most, such as to try and get an angle right for a jump, such as that 'don't drown' ascending acrobatic bit in the final boss area and that hovering spiralling segmented climable netting/mesh bit. That was the single most frutrating part of the whole finale, if not the whole game. It's smooth sailing with the odd bumps up until there and after it, but by God did that take me a while - because you had to wrestle with the camera WHILE attempting the difficult manoeuvre, a sort of manoeuvre you hadn't faced before in any earlier part of the game, and one that I adamantly believe cannot be done without deliberately taking damage from a burning section of the mesh in order to gain enough height to make the tricky jump. When you want to look around to explore and scout out collectibles, you feel rather restricted. Even with high mouse sensitivity, I found myself having to skid the mouse over and over again to have a good look around and even then it seemed to move just as slow. It just adds unnecessary frustration when you're trying to enjoy and immerse yourself in the game's surroundings and puzzles. Again, I believe this wouldn't be an issue if you were to use a controller to play instead of the keyboard and mouse.To finish off my criticisms (in case I start to inflate and turn purple, becoming a Jasper the Critic 2.0 and spit my popcorn at you), I'll have a quick snip at maps. In short: there aren't any! Ok, well, yes, there is one, for the campgrounds, an area that you won't be visiting as often after you can cross the lake, and an area you can't even return to after you hit the 'Point of No Return'. No other map. At all. For any other area. And yet, there is a MAP TAB on the main menu, which only displays as 'out of map range' when you're in any area other than the campgrounds. That was a bit disappointing in my opinion, a huge potential for additional exploration and aiding in finding collectibles was missed there.Finally, the achievements in this game – be careful everyone! It's one of those games where after you hit a certain 'Point of No Return' – you won't be able to go back to some areas to collect stuff for some achievements, and you may miss some 'witness' achievements altogether unless you know when and where to go look for them in-between the different points of the story. I had to start another game from scratch to get the Pokeylope related achievement for example. I'd suggest making lots of separate saves  to help counter this.To close, it's a weird and wonderful game that I enjoyed very much and would recommend to others. But to those others that are interested, I would strongly suggest you grab a controller and get that working properly – I believe it will make things a heck of a lot less frustrating and smoother to play with. As well as SAVING EVERY OTHER MINUTE to prevent getting setbacks from those nasty random crashes and freezes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts seems to be finally getting the respect it deserves. Apparently action-adventure platformers are something of a niche genre nowadays, but at least they are still being made. Not everything has to be a first-person shooter, especially if you're trying to tell as involving a story as this one.I won't say too much as I don't want to spoil it for those who don't know and are tempted, but if you give Psychonauts a chance you'll find it very rewarding. Fascinatingly creative level design, a hilarous script and top-notch voice acting make this game a delight the entire way though.Well, with the possible exception of Meat Circus. You know what I'm talking about.The only possible gripe I'd have about this game is that the controls are a little lacking, but hopefully by the time you need to be fast and accurate you'll have mastered them. Well, that and the fact they have a sequel hook that hasn't been resolved.Come on, people! Psychonauts is now getting the recognition it deserves, but that's not how the industry works! Less than 100,000 copies in it's first year does not feed the developers. If we don't take a chance on quirky, unusual games, all we'll have soon is Assassin's Creed 14 and Call of Duty 37. Tim Schafer deserves better than this.I've also nominated this game for a Steam award. You should too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts is a fantastic game, I would end the review here and tell you to ""just buy it"", but since this is by far one of the best games I have played on any platform, I need to say a few things about it.Now this is an action platformer. There's platforming, and alongside that there are enemies and obstacles to overcome. The platforming at a few times felt clunky, but for the most part was an enjoyable experience. But the game's fun isn't in the platforming or whatever, it's everything about this game that makes it the wonderful experience that it is. And that's what it is, an experience. It's strange, quirky, full of personality, and original. No matter if you're just sitting around listening to character's clever dialouge, or exploring the vast enviroments searching for plentiful goodies, you're always going to be entertained.I can't go any further without spoiling any of the plot, but I can whole-heartedly say this game is utterly fantastic, and has aged like fine wine. Yeah it's old now, and it's not the prettiest looking thing, but it's still beautiful and elegant in it's own little way.>Good characters>Great, unique story>Good gameplay>Funny DIalouge>Excellent score and voice acting>Decent controls (as long as you're using a controller that is, idk about the mouse and keyboard but i wouldn't try it)>Fun enviroments that are each uniqueThe only shortomings I've had with the game are some parts of levels that were very frustrating, because sometimes you on't have a good idea on what you should be doing at some point. But when you figure it out, you feel like a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot. Not really the game's fault, more or less my own, but I still would have liked more direction at certain points.Also some enemies that kept respawning were annoying but whatever.Overall, this game is fantastic, and you should totally get it.TL;DR : ♥♥♥♥ing buy it you nerds.

												It has been a long long time since i have fallen in love with a video game so quickly. I only recently finished my playthrough of Psychonauts, and i loved every little minute of it. Previously, i had heard many say that Psychonauts was an underappreciated hidden gem, that deserved so much more. To be honest i thought these people were simply over exaggerating the greatness of this game. As i soon learned my opinion was that of a fool's. Psychonauts blew me away as I began to play it. From the very beginning i knew that i would love this game, and its estetic. One of the very first things i noticed right away was visually, how everything looked. There is a distinct style that every character, and environment has: Nothing has perfect edges and corners. Everything has a slight bend, or at a peculiar angle, but is not to the point where it is jarring to the eyes, or unpleasant. This gives the game a unique look, that is not easily duplicated. Every environment seems different from the last, with it's own singular theme, that makes it look as though it could stand on its own. I enjoy this, because different places and levels SHOULD be solitary in their style. Different characters personalities reflect their their subconscious, giving you the true impression that you are in THIS person's mind. And each character has their own distinct personality, from the kids in the camp, to the coaches teaching. They all have a trait, or something more to them that grants them lots of... I guess the best way to describe it would be quirkiness. There is just something to them... I just love the way they act, the things they talk about, actions, responses, jokes, etc. Many a time have i been playing this game with a giant♥♥♥♥♥♥eating grin on my face, because of something somone did.  All of the characters in this game, even the protaganists, and enemies, are lovable. However the most lovable of all is your main character Razz (can't remember if im spelling that right). He somehow captures the essence of childlike wonder, and reminds me alot of myself when i was a kid. He somehow just has this... draw to him, somehting about him that makes you proud to play as him as you progress to the story, you see his character grow immensly. Moving right along to the story, I won't say much, you can watch the trailer if you want a preview, but I'll leave it at this. I couldn't  stop playing. I wanted to see what would happen next; who's mind I would enter, I just wanted more and more and more. I was entranced in the deep and moving narrative. Even at the end of the game, i found myself wanting more, and was genuinely sad when i realized I was probably on the final level. This was partly established because of the story, but also because of how engaging and fun the gameplay was. You utilize your own psychic abilities, which you earn via merrit badges. You earn these throughout the story, and by occasionally ranking up (which can be done by various means.) Every ability has their own time and place, and unlike most games (cough cough Tomb Raider reboot) you dont learn a certain ability and then never use it in the game ever again. There's always a time and place for  to a certain ability, and all of them are useful. Now some of these abilities are combat based, others movement or puzzle based. Psychonauts blends solid platforming with puzzle solving (I'm not really talking Legend of Zelda style puzzles, more puzzles you need to use your head to solve. Yes that pun was intended), along with a banjo Kazooie esque exploration. Along with fun combat and a ton of collectables to... collect. There is a lot to do in Psychonauts,  one can spend hours engaged in this masterpiece. However, this game is not that difficult, I didnt have that hard a time playing through it. There are moments where it has its difficulties, sometimes it may be vague (but this isnt too jarring or game breaking. Just a little difficulty finding where or what one must do to progress. I only had this problem once). But on the upside no major glitches, or save problems, etc.  Personally i love this game, and i knew it after about 20 minutes of playing. So i was thouroughly happy when i got more than my money's worth for a far longer game than i had expected. So am I here to tell you that Psychonauts is the most underrated games of the century and that Tim Shcafer is a god, like most of the internet (or people on the internet ive hear say that), no. I'm here to tell you that Psychonauts is a damn good game that I'm glad as hell glad I got it. And I'm not here to tell you its an underappreciated gem, I'm just here to tell you its a gem. I love it, and I'm sure you will too. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of my all time favorite games and you should play it. I don't know what else to write so here is a recipe for the only thing I know of that is almost as good as this game INGREDIENTS:1 cup powdered sugar1/2 cup creamy peanut butter2 small boxes of instant vanilla pudding (home made pudding is better but instant is far easier) 1 (9-inch) gram cracker pie crust 2 cups whipped creamSlightly adapted from The Amish CookDIRECTIONS:in one bowl make puddingin an other bowl mix peanut butter and powdered sugar until you have a bowl of little peanut butter nuggets.After pudding is somewhat cool you can start to assemble the pie.Add half the peanut butter nuggets to the bottom of the pie shell. Top with pudding. Add half the remaining peanut butter nuggets to the top of the pudding.Top with whipped cream and remaining peanut butter nuggets.Let the pie cool in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to set up before cutting.

												Psychonauts seems to be finally getting the respect it deserves. Apparently action-adventure platformers are something of a niche genre nowadays, but at least they are still being made. Not everything has to be a first-person shooter, especially if you're trying to tell as involving a story as this one.I won't say too much as I don't want to spoil it for those who don't know and are tempted, but if you give Psychonauts a chance you'll find it very rewarding. Fascinatingly creative level design, a hilarous script and top-notch voice acting make this game a delight the entire way though.Well, with the possible exception of Meat Circus. You know what I'm talking about.The only possible gripe I'd have about this game is that the controls are a little lacking, but hopefully by the time you need to be fast and accurate you'll have mastered them. Well, that and the fact they have a sequel hook that hasn't been resolved.Come on, people! Psychonauts is now getting the recognition it deserves, but that's not how the industry works! Less than 100,000 copies in it's first year does not feed the developers. If we don't take a chance on quirky, unusual games, all we'll have soon is Assassin's Creed 14 and Call of Duty 37. Tim Schafer deserves better than this.I've also nominated this game for a Steam award. You should too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely incredible game. Still able to be played today. After a while, you don't notice the aged graphics, because cartoony graphics age well.Gameplay is great. Story is great. Characters are great.Exploring is a blast as well, because the setting is unique... you play as a psychic child in a camp for other psychics. Reminds me of a few of my school camps.This game comes from a time when games didn't have to be excessively violent to allow for great gameplay, and when singleplayer campaigns actually had some love and dedication put into them. There needs to be more games like this.Well, what are you waiting for? Chuck your goggles on and embark on your journey to become a Psychonaut!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is really hard to explain but it has so much charm and is one of the best adventure games i have ever played. Every time I've beaten it (4 times not just Steam edition), I have always encountered new little easter eggs that are super easy to miss, it might seem linear but if you explore you will be surprised how much humor this game has, you can tell they definitely put so much time and effort into this game. It's a very rare game indeed, even the music and characters warm you up lol honestly I duno what it is about this game but it just brings back amazing fun memories, from when I remember playing it back in the day. Can't wait for the sequel!Pros:- Actually hilarious humor- Each level is unique in every way- Very colorful game actually has aged quit well- Memorable characters- Really good voice actors and music/sound- Has replayability if you into getting achievements and easter eggsThere is a reason the overall reviews are ""Overwhelmingly Positive""!Cons:- Kinda short- Once you beat it 101% nothing else to do- Camera and controls are ok, but you can get used to itHonestly though for the price it is now you can't really complain.

												If anyone is reading this review and is thinking ""is this game as good as people say?"" my response is: yes, it is as good as people tell you.lets get into the pro's of the game:+ the clever, hilarious writing shines if you focus/listen to the diolog.+ the game holds up well for a game as old as it is: i.e the graphics, cutscenes (kind of), gameplay, etc. (if you have the right graphics card (I'll get into that))+ the levitation ability: it gives you access to everything you can see (whether it be through an exploit (possibly removed) or due to how fast, floaty and fun it is)+ the collectables (i.e the memory vaults and emotional baggage) are quite rewarding and makes you feel smart.+ it's challanging enough to make it satisfiying, but not hard enough to hate it (but you may experience some anger on the parts where it's obvious (*cough* *cough* black velvitopia *cough* *cough* meat cirus *cough* *cough*))+ there are probably pro's, but I can't think of any right now.As for the cons, there is no shortage of them, so, just be aware of the following:- if you are trying to go for 100% compleition , I wish you luck you sorry sod, because the other collectible I didn't mention were figments, one of the 4 ways of leveling up. they are so indestinct that it makes completing this game 100% a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and practiacally soul consuming (this problem is amplified in the levitation stage and waterloo world)- you can tell that this is doublefines' first 3d platformer, and, while I say it's an amazing first attempt, it kinda shows when you're stuck in a rock (like Delfy) or when the game turns a 180 on your♥♥♥♥♥and works against you (i.e the physics, camara, controls, etc).- if you plan on using your keyboard and make custom bindings, um, well... I would advise using a controller: the layout is simple and easy to use. As for custom bindings, if you quit the game, you may as well say goodbye to the time you spent. bindings are pointless as they go away after guiting the game to go grab a pizza or something, hence, why I'd advise using a controller- I'd also advice getting a really good, non amd graphics card, otherwise everything just looks glitchy.- meat cirus... 'nuff said.it may seem I have a lot of negative to say about this game and I don't like it, but, I really do enjoy and I'd recomend it to a friend.however, I'd only reccommend it to someone who is good at video games, like, really good at video games.Also, the positives will heavily outweigh the negatives. Like I said with the diolog, but, really, whatever positives there are really shines through. By all means this game is not perfect, but, you should at least give it a try. I'd rate this game 8/10 would advise using a controller			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ahh yes, back when double-fine was good you got to play a trippy game with a banjo-kazooie feel as a main character voiced by Rodney Squirrel.While I did enjoy this game, and suggest it.1: I suggest you have a gamepadand 2: I suggest you do better than I did.  I gave up when I had to play cleanup around the camp to buy an item to help me finish the next level.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gex + Banjo Kazooie + Camp Lazlo + psychic powers. Do yourself a favor if you ever get around to playing this gem.Do not go out of the way to collect the little bananas/musical notes/figments. Getting every little item might satisfy your OCD but will detract from the experience overall when you spend upwards of an hour or more on each and every map combing every square inch for that little picture that fades in and out. When you get to the end of the game it automatically creates a point-of-no return save. You can use that save and from there revisit ever level to get every little item but only IF you feel so inclined. Once you hit the point of no return just fling yourself at that brick wall of a final level and it will crumble against your fists oh so satisfyingly. Intentinoally annoying characters have never been good. They will continue to never be good. Physics can be a real♥♥♥♥♥pain (lol 3D platformers) but this game is practically devoid of any punishment for messing up. The less you participate in scavenging the more fun you will have.

												Psychonauts is a classic action/adventure platformer which follows the story of a young psychic named Raz. In his quest to join the Psychonauts - an elite group of international psychic secret agents--he breaks into their secret training facility: Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp. But this is no average psychic summer camp! A mysterious villain has kidnapped Raz’s fellow campers and stolen their brains. Now he must use his psychic powers of Telekinesis, Levitation, and most of all his ability to project himself into the minds of others--to find the loose noodles and keep them from falling into the wrong hands. Fight mental demons! Uncover hidden memories! Sort emotional baggage!Psychonauts has a quite unique story and level design in addition to various kinds of psychic abilities. Raz's character is pretty well developed. He is perhaps the best voiced character in game. However the other characters are pretty dull and not quite well developed. They are pretty forgettable. In terms of visuals Psychonauts is pretty decent with some pretty good art work complimented with some wonderful sound production which plays a huge part in the game. The level design is great and solving puzzles can be fun as every puzzle has something unique to offer Pros:- Stunning Visuals - Wonderful sound production- Voice Acting- Save Anywhere- Decent PuzzlesCons:- Troublesome Camera Controls- Few blocky objects- Forgettable Characters			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts : โครตพลังจิตป่วนหัวคนบ้า(7/10 B++)ก่อนจะมี brutal legends เรามี Psychonauts เป็นความสำเร็จหลักของ Double Fine  ผมจำได้ว่า ได้เห็นเกมนี้ครั้งแรกทางช่อง G4 ที่ true เอามาฉายตอนนั้น มันมาเป็นรายการสารคดีของตัวเกม Psychonauts ที่ฉายให้เห็นถึงช่วงเวลา 1 อาทิตย์สุดท้ายก่อนเกมจะวางขาย ผมได้ฟังสิ่งที่ผู้พัฒนาเกม บอกถึงความน่าสนใขของตัวเกม แล้วผมชอบแนวคิดของเกมมาก ที่ว่าด้วยเรื่องการเข้าไปในจิตใจของคนอื่น บวกกับค่ายที่ฝึกสอนสายลับผู้มีพลังจิต(เหมือนลอก XMEN มาเลย)ตัวเกมจะเป็นแนวกึ่งเดินตะลุยกึ่ง open world เกมค่อนข้างที่จะมีอิสระให้เราไปไหนมาไหน แต่ก็จะบังคับให้เราทำภารกิจหลักตลอด(สมัยนั้น เกม open world ยังไม่บูมมาก) โดยเฉพาะการเข้าไปในหัวของคนอื่น ซึ่งผมว่ามันเจ๋งมาก เหมือนเราได้เห็นโลกที่อยู่ในหัวของคนๆหนึ่ง (เหมือนหนังเรื่อง being john malkovich ) ตัวเกมจะสลับกับระหว่างโลกจริงกับโลกในจิตใจไปๆมาๆ โดยจุดหมายของเกมคือการแก้ปัญหาทางสภาพจิตใจในหัวของคนอื่นไปเรื่อยๆการออกแบบตัวละครกับโลกในเกมดูคล้ายๆหลุดออกมาจากหนังของ tim burtonระบบการเล่น : ตัวเกมจะเป็นแนวเดินตะลุยแก้ปริศษาไปตามทาง เดินๆย้อนไปย้อนมาบ้าง หลังๆมันจะคล้ายๆกับ mario 64 มากระบบการต่อสู้ผมว่ามันทำออกมาไม่ค่อยมีดี เพราะส่วนใหญ่เกมมันจะเน้นให้คุยเยอะ การต่อสู้ระหว่างทางมันเลยทำให้ดูน่าเบื่อตลอดทั้งเกม แต่กลับกันผมกลับชอบการสู้บอส ของเกมนี้มาก ทั้งสนุกบวกฮา การสู้กับบอสดูจะให้เราใช้สมองอยู่พอตัว ก็ตามแบบฉบับเกมสมัยก่อนที่วิธีการกำจัดบอสนั้นมีวิธีของมัน ไม่ใช้ฟัดๆหลับๆอย่างเดียวภาพ : จัดอยู่ในระดับกลาง เป็นภาพการ์ตูนที่ดูไม่สวยอะไรมาก แต่บอกตามตรงเห็นครั้งผมนึกถึงหนังของ tim burton โครต ทั้งการออกแบบตัวละคร การออกแบบโลกในหัวคนอื่นหรือแม้กระทั้งเพลงประกอบข้อเสีย : -เกมมี bugs ให้เห็รอยู่บางส่วน โดยเฉพาะ พวก bugs ติดกำแพง ติดบันไดบางสรุป : ผมว่าเกมนี้ทำออกมาค่อนข้างดีเลยนะ ถึงมันจะเป็นแค่เกมเด็กเล่น ที่เล่นข้ามเวลาแล้วตัวเกมก็ไม่ได้ยาวอะไร ผมเล่นแล้วก็เพลินๆดี ผ่านไปได้ แต่มันก็มีบางจุดเหมือนกันที่มันน่าเบื่อ เช่น ฉากที่เราจะต้อง เดินเข้าตัวตึก แล้วมีใยแมงมุมขวางประตู เราต้องใช้เงินจำนวนหนึ่้งไปซื้อเครื่องกำจัดใย แล้วเกมก็จะบังคับเราให้ไปซื้อไอ้เครื่องนั้นอย่างเดียว ซึ่งผมว่ามันน่าเบื่อโครต เพราะเราต้องมานั่งเสียเวลาเก็บใบไม้ม่วงเฮงซวยที่ใช้แทนค่าเงิน เพื่อไปซื้อเครื่องกำจัดใย แล้วใช้มันผ่านประตูแค่ครั้งเดียวของเกม			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For all its imaginative flair, people are going to be put off by Psychonauts’ haphazard assembly; it has all the mechanical aspects of a product not quite completed, made by people not entirely sure what they were doing. At some point, the game decides you’ve spent enough time learning how it’s supposed to work and assumes you can effortlessly pull off a series of challenging jumps, or that you’ve mastered its fumbling combat system. You haven’t; of course you haven’t, and what follows is a chorus of curses and rage-quitting or, in the case of the poor saps trying to play this on a keyboard, uncontrollable rage. But for those who can work past these flaws, Psychonauts has traits that seem largely forgotten in today’s conveyer belt of annual sequels and follow-the-fad gameplay. It’s genuinely funny, for one and has just the right amount of surrealist endearment and adolescent awkwardness to make it completely unique. There’s nothing else out there quite like Psychonauts, where you can be fighting a lucha libre wrestling cat pretending to be an eagle in a neon pastel ring one moment, then be terrorising a city full of tiny lumpy fishmen as a Godzilla-sized monster the very next. Where you can be listening to a classmate tell you that his tin foil hat stops him accidently exploding faces or another one trying to sneak time on the camp radio to return to her home planet, because she feels this world is doomed.

												This is one of the best games I've ever played- hands down, this game is a masterpiece. The story of this game is amazing, well thought through, and overwhelmingly humorous, and very challenging. It actually feels like the creators took more than 2 months like normal games do to make the plot. Overall I really cannot explain the plot in depth to give a great feeling, so just go enjoy it yourself. Psychonauts is also a giant game- leaving 48.2 hours of mine JUST for the story, and not for going back for the thousands of collectables this game has to offer.What some people assume and will assume is the strange art of the game. The art looks a litte odd, but overall it gets normal, and cartoonish and funny as well. Sure, its not your average realistic art, but as you venture deeper into the art, it really shapes the game as to what the gameplay is; which is traveling inside the minds of others and fixing their mental state, which appears to be either a compact, organized mind, as simple as a theatre, or even a twisty and odd, but amazingly humorous neighborhood.Overall, this game I think deserves a 10/10 for me. This is one of the best games over the thousands I've ever played, including cross platform. Yes, I'm talking about one of the top games I've played compared to PlayStation consoles, Xbox consoles, handhelds, Nintendo consoles, iOS and Android, and desktop/PC/computer. I've never in my life played a story in a game as good as this. My only regret of this game is beating it, as I don't know what to do now.......And also for Notch to not fund a sequel to the game. Why Notch, WHY!!! It's only 18 million, thats 1/300 out of your pocket.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I missed Psychonaut when it first came out in 2006 and only heard about it a few years later. I only just recently finally decided to play it and I'm so glad I did. Psychonaut is an adventure platforming game with a great story and humor. Psychonaut are special people gifted with psychics abilities. You play the game as Raz, the new kid of a psychonaut summercamp. What makes this game intersting is the variety of game mechanics that it introduces. As a psychonaut, you can enter into other people's mind. All the characters are very well designed and their levels are completly different. Even today, this game still looks really innovative. Finally, the game really aged well. The graphics and gameplay are still very good. If you want to play one of the best games from the PS2/Xbox era, this is it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Without a doubt, the guys at Double Fine know how to make a fun and challenging game. Psychonauts is fun and it does get challenging towards the end as well as it gets just a bit frustrating, contrasting with the rest of the game. There's also a lot of stuff to do, lots of collectibles and secrets to find, achievements are a blast to pursuit. What they always seem to make perfect, however, are the characters. Voice actors are amazing and writing is excelent. There is variety in levels and boss fights, although the rest can be a bit repetitive. I mostly recommend trying to get the ""I LOVE PUNCHING!"" achievement, as it's one of the most anoying yet satisfying once completed achievements in a video game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I personally love this game.  Although it came out in 2004 and got remastered in 2011 it is a perfect game.  The originality of the game is great.  The level design is so creative.  Great voice acting with halarious gameplay makes this game beautiful.  This game is one of a kind and should be looked at.  It got awards like 'The best game no one played'.  $9.99 for a great game is hard to come by in this economy. 11/10-warrior1612, 11/10-ebloomy, 11/10-(TFT)SheeplockHolmes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More detail can be found further in.Good -- -Excellent voice acting and dialogue. -Fun story -Very well designed, fully fleshed-out charactersBad -- - Audio and port issues - Minor design flawsDebatable -- - Balancing issues - game visuals look good, despite age - some poor design choices - music was goodAs a general overview, Psychonauts is a rather old game that has a lot of hype behind it. This is the first time I've played it, and was informed of the game by every gaming youtuber ever saying it's amazing. I found the game to be fun, but frustrating at times. The gameplay is basically that of a Third-Person Collect-Um-Up (Similar to Spyro, for example). The voice acting, dialogue, story, and visuals were big pluses for me. Add to that some very strong, well realized character, and you have something special. The quality of the features listed above were a surprise. The strong parts of the game vastly outweigh the negatives.So to get into it - Voice acting and dialogue - The quality of the writing in this game was a delight. No lines stood out to me as awkward or poorly delivered. It felt like Triple A quality.- Story - The story is fairly simple. The main character, Raz, runs away from home to go to a summer camp. This summer camp caters to psychics, and Raz, with innate psychic powers, fits right it as he waits for his father to pick him up. Along the way, Raz stumbles on a conspiracy that forces him to use his powers to save the day. It's not too heavy, but gets a lot darker in places. Most of the dark parts are optional, and were an appreciated surprise to find. The story doesn't feel stale or overused. In fact, it feels fresh to this day. - The characters - The characters of this game are wonderful. Every single one is well designed, well voice-acted. nnd has interesting dialogue. Their personalities are conveyed well, and each has something interesting to say. They feel like characters, as opposed to throwaway NPC's that are common in other games.- Visuals - The visuals have aged well, in my opinion. The cartoonish, and totally non-realistic look helps immensely with that. It's colorful, and looks great in motion. - Gameplay - The gameplay is simple and fun, but has its hiccups at times. The powers you gain are all useful, fun, and/or overpowered in some way. Some abilities are only useful as a way to flesh out the world and your understanding of some characters. Others will be used almost constantly as they have too many uses that help you progress. The platforming in this game is made easier by certain powers, but here is were some problems come in. The geometry of the world can screw you sometimes. For example, on grind rails, you can get stuck and be unable to    go forward. Conversely, you can be going so fast that you literally fly off (or the game forces you to follow the rail path, making it appear as is Raz is flying). Some ledges don't want to let you grab them, and others will cancel you active    powers. This is annoying and can result in you falling and have to being the climb all over again. The game has these little frustrations spattered throughout.-Balancing issues - This game has one of 2 problems, either it's too easy or it's too hard. There is no in-between, and that is frustrating. Whether the game is one of the other depends on how thorough you are with the collecting. If you try to collect everything, you will feel overpowered as i did. If you just run to objectives and only get levels when necessary, the game will be much harder. This can be a tad annoying, or insanely frustrating depending on which problem you have. It isn't game breaking, but it can take away from an otherwise fantastic experience.- Poor design choices - There were moments in the game that felt like poor choices on the developers end. Basically, some of the visual design makes things confusing. There were points where i got stuck, because i didn't know what was a platform and what wasn't, or what walls were scalable and what weren't. There were times when i died or lost a lot of progress because a thick ledge turned out to be an invisible wall. Again, it isn't game breaking. Instead, it's another frustration that i had throw on the pile. - Audio issues - The game had some audio issues were some things were too loud or quite. An example would be the fire lighting the main lodge at night. It sounded ike the entire building is on fire. Also, there were time where the dialogue volume would drop or spike for no reason.- Bugs and other issues - So this is a major failing on the game, and one of the only game breaking things i have to say about the game. Before I elaborate, i will say that there are fixes for the issues to be listed.    -- Crashing -- The game will crash, and it will do so a lot. This will often happen between areas. I found that it didn't crash until later, but it would crash often after it started. The crashes vary from just closing the game, failing to respond, or forcing you to restart you PC. The game auto saves (thank god), but it will keep happening unless you fix it. The fix is so stupidly easy, that i'm am shocked the crashing occurs at all. You need to change the compatability from Windows xp (or whatever it is) to Windows 97.    -- Audio bugs -- There will be occasional popping sounds and jagged noises for some (but not all). There is a fix, but i don't know it.   -- Controller prompts -- the game defaults to keyboard, and all commands will appear as keyboard keys. Even if you are using a controller, prompts will be for the keyboard. All keys and buttons are rebindable, but you need to use a fairly complex fix to get controller prompts to workOverall -- The game is a lot of fun. The fun is often punctuated by moments of frustration. It ends up being a fairly solid game that lacks a bit of polish in the gameplay and visual design. Definitely worth playing, but you will have to work for your fun at times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A long time ago, I read a magazine article (back when they existed) that listed Psychonauts as the best game you never played that given year. While I do not normally take too much direction from magazines or web sites I thought I would take this one recommendation and some time later (it takes time for me to get around to things) I sauntered over to the game store and found a XBox copy in their used section and picked it up. I can say now that the magazine was definately accurate in its description as a good game but was no longer accurate in saying that I had not played it.I'm old enough to have grown up playing that classic platformers of the NES and SNES era and was always a fan of such games. When Mario 64 came out I was immediately impressed the platformers transition to 3D gaming. Psychonauts is compariable to Mario 64 in much of the basics of 3D platforming but with some evolution beyond Mario 64. First, there is an actual story to follow; second there are slightly more fleshed out characters; and third the environments have moved beyond the obvious themes (fire, ice, castle) of Mario style platformers.The story is fun and highly comedic. It at times will play with a trope and try to switch it up; such as the child running away from the circus. The characters themselves have some interesting details and various quirks and with some of the characters you get to dive right into their mind to explore them in a little more detail even if surreal and filled with metaphors. It is these trips into a characters mind that allows the game environment to shine and be unique and evolutionary. Unfortunately, the number of minds you get to explore felt too few mainly because they were so enterataining and I so wanted more. Thankfully, there is now a Psychonauts 2 coming down the pipe.Somewhere in this simple review I wanted to make a play on the term minefield/mindfield but just couldn't get it to work so there we have it. Psychonauts is one of my favorite games and one of the few I have actually gotten around to finishing and completing (twice even, thanks to getting it again on Steam).(This review done under duress in order to complete the 2016 Autumn Sale badge.)

												For all its imaginative flair, people are going to be put off by Psychonauts’ haphazard assembly; it has all the mechanical aspects of a product not quite completed, made by people not entirely sure what they were doing. At some point, the game decides you’ve spent enough time learning how it’s supposed to work and assumes you can effortlessly pull off a series of challenging jumps, or that you’ve mastered its fumbling combat system. You haven’t; of course you haven’t, and what follows is a chorus of curses and rage-quitting or, in the case of the poor saps trying to play this on a keyboard, uncontrollable rage. But for those who can work past these flaws, Psychonauts has traits that seem largely forgotten in today’s conveyer belt of annual sequels and follow-the-fad gameplay. It’s genuinely funny, for one and has just the right amount of surrealist endearment and adolescent awkwardness to make it completely unique. There’s nothing else out there quite like Psychonauts, where you can be fighting a lucha libre wrestling cat pretending to be an eagle in a neon pastel ring one moment, then be terrorising a city full of tiny lumpy fishmen as a Godzilla-sized monster the very next. Where you can be listening to a classmate tell you that his tin foil hat stops him accidently exploding faces or another one trying to sneak time on the camp radio to return to her home planet, because she feels this world is doomed.

												I just finished my first playthrough of this game 7 and a half years after its release.  It's a very strange game to be sure.  It is a very unique concept playing a child who is training to be a psychic warrior, battling monsters inside other people's minds.  The game is very well written and despite being so stylized, the characters are quite realistic (though a few of them are fairly annoying.)  It also still manages to be quite humorous despite its age.The game's setting at a kids' summer camp and the art style lead me to believe the game is aimed at kids, yet the subject matter is a bit more mature.  I think the game would be much too difficult for children as well.  It's a bit confusing for me.Now Double Fine was nice enough to update the game for Steam after many years which I greatly appreciate.  After putting in that effort though, I'd think they would have fixed some of the outstanding bugs.  I ran into quite a few ladders with broken dismounts at the top (one was so bad it took me about 10 tries each time to get off the ladder at the top and I had to climb it 10+ times) and a few other level glitches.  There are quite a few really badly placed fixed camera angles throughout the game.  The ""smart camera"" won't turn off despite changing the setting so the keyboard/mouse controls as essentially unusable.  I highly recommend downloading a mod called PsychoPad which gives you a modern gamepad layout with proper button prompts for the standard 360 controller (something else I think Double Fine should've taken care of.)Overall a very enjoyable game, though I wouldn't go so far as to call it a classic like many people do.

												This is one of the best games I've ever played- hands down, this game is a masterpiece. The story of this game is amazing, well thought through, and overwhelmingly humorous, and very challenging. It actually feels like the creators took more than 2 months like normal games do to make the plot. Overall I really cannot explain the plot in depth to give a great feeling, so just go enjoy it yourself. Psychonauts is also a giant game- leaving 48.2 hours of mine JUST for the story, and not for going back for the thousands of collectables this game has to offer.What some people assume and will assume is the strange art of the game. The art looks a litte odd, but overall it gets normal, and cartoonish and funny as well. Sure, its not your average realistic art, but as you venture deeper into the art, it really shapes the game as to what the gameplay is; which is traveling inside the minds of others and fixing their mental state, which appears to be either a compact, organized mind, as simple as a theatre, or even a twisty and odd, but amazingly humorous neighborhood.Overall, this game I think deserves a 10/10 for me. This is one of the best games over the thousands I've ever played, including cross platform. Yes, I'm talking about one of the top games I've played compared to PlayStation consoles, Xbox consoles, handhelds, Nintendo consoles, iOS and Android, and desktop/PC/computer. I've never in my life played a story in a game as good as this. My only regret of this game is beating it, as I don't know what to do now.......And also for Notch to not fund a sequel to the game. Why Notch, WHY!!! It's only 18 million, thats 1/300 out of your pocket.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands down my favorite Double Fine game, and definitely high in my top 10 all-time favorite games (if not tied for #1). Psychonauts has some of the most interesting level designs and quirky humor/style you'll find in any game, with the Invader Zim voice actor as your main character being icing on the cake.The game is a mix of platforming, action, puzzle-solving, and exploration, and it nails all of them. Every level is incredibly unique, often with totally different gameplay mechanics than the next. It is the product of incredibly creative people getting to just go nuts, each putting their own blend of awesome into what they've worked on.Psychonauts is absolutely a must-play for any gamer (assuming you don't *just* play mindless shooters or mobile games), and will make you an instant Double Fine fan. I cannot recommend it enough! Here's to hoping for a sequel in the future as well!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's obvious that the majority of the developer's budget went towards art and level design rather than gameplay. I'm cool with that, because the buttons still work at least... but the controls border on horrible and the gameplay is a bit tedious. It's your typical 3D platformer, similar to the Banjo-Kazooie era of platforming. Still, Psychonauts is a splendid game and deserves your money, if only to influence a sequel. Oh, do yourself a favour and use a controller.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've never been more unsatisfied or angry at a game in my life, and I don't think I'm hyperbolizing much, despite how that may sound.The real problem is mouse+keyboard is super broken atm and while 80% of the game has been great and I thoroughly enjoyed it, I'm just filled with rage about some of the bosses which I can barely deal with due to ""smart camera"" being stuck on.  This makes the game force your camera rotation to face the way it thinks you should be looking despite all your best efforts.  You really need to be able to adjust your view angle precisely with the mouse to make acurate jumps and acrobatic movements with the keyboard.  With smart camera stuck on, you simply cannot do that.  This makes the final boss worse than playing I Wanna Be The Guy, which is known for its absurd difficulty, but at least has excellent snappy controls.It sounds like this didn't used to be a problem, but some patch in recent years broke the ability to disable this ""smart camera"" feature and so we're stuck with it.  INI file editing doesn't help, so I'm considering breaking out a hex editor and mucking with some deeper components of the game.  I may even get a game pad just to finish this game, which I'm loathe to do.I'm not saying you shouldn't play this game, but be ready for this nonsense and maybe just use a controller from the start.

												Still as fantastic as ever, and looks great in 4K (aside from the pre-rendered cutscenes).But don't play it without a USB or WiFi Xbox 360 controller, ever. Leave the default controller mapping as is (it's the same as the Xbox mapping if you Google it).Also, you might want to remap the keyboard keys to fix the on-screen prompts, eg ""A, B, X, Y, Left Shift = Left Trigger, L = Left Bumper, etc.There are also apparently unofficial patches for the on-screen prompts to show the proper buttons, but that's not really necessary.

												Amazing game!It's full of personality and loads of fun.Be ready to get a bit trippy when you enter someone's mind, and to hate your life when you're missing only one figment to do 100% on a level.Battle inner demons from not so sane people.Make sure you explore well, so you get the collectables, which rewards with new powers and upgrades.

												Colourful, funny and solid gameplay. Never played this on the original xbox, so there are no rose tinted glasses here. This game holds up very well for its age. When old games are hyped up a lot, I'm always skeptical, nostalgia is a powerful thing.  But this game absolutely lives up to the hype around it, and deserves its cult following. I really enjoyed this game, and would highly recommend it to anyone!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Psychonauts is so full of imagination, story,  humor, and originality... its more of an experience than a game. In the world of gaming geeks, this is one of those required titles, like ""moby♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; for writers.  It follows the story of ""Ras"" who possesses mysterious psychic powers, and his adventures at a summer camp for similarly endowed kids.  The gameplay is similar to other 3D platformer titles, with puzzles requiring clever thinking and fast fingers to complete.  Plays well with a joystick or keyboard.  Highly recommended.

												I remembered loving this game when I had it on xbox and when i saw it on Steam I had to have it! I was worried it might not hold the same magic for me but it does, as soon as the opening scene began i found myself smiling and gleefully anticipating what was to come. If you played this on console back in the day, get it! If you've never played this game and are looking for a game with bizarre humor, unique gameplay and  unforgettable characters, get it! You won't reegret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really enjoyed this game. It's a platformer in the same mold as games like Spyro or Ratchet and Clank and manages to be a lot of fun. The level design is amazing with some really entertaining and original levels, for example theres one level where you find yourself as a giant in a city  populated by fishmen and you have to rampage through it like Godzilla. There's a lot to do in this game as well with lots of collectibles and different powers to unlock so theres plenty reason to explore the different levels and areas and there's a good 15-20 hours of gameplay if your looking to do everything.The only downsides are that the graphics look quite dated and the camera angles canbe a bit awkward at times but not enough to impact on enjoyment of the game. Also while the game is probably better played with a controller the Xbox controller symbols haven't been added so it's a case of figuring out for yourself which buttons do what.Again this isn't a major issue.Overall this is a really fun game thats really worth playing. It's a 8/10 for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really good game If this helps it's like The legend of zelda but Better it's a puzzle game cartoon with special powers that you learn and you learn Rasputens(The main charachter) backstory while you go through the game.

												I hightly recommend this game to everyone! Psychonauts will draw you into an experience that you will not soon forget. At times the game is frustrating, while at other exhilirating! You'll fight through multiple mental disorders as you try to save your summer camp from a brain stealing mad man! Levels include schizophrenia, deression, mania, abandonment, Napoleon complex, and more! This odd quirky game will at times feel like Invader Zim had a threeway with Dune and Earthworm Jim. In short: set evil trees on fire with your mind!!! 4,689,234,216,847 / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
