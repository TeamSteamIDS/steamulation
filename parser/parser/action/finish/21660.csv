												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whist I recommend the gameplay it's self, I do not recommend buying this title, as it's broken.I have made a ticket asking Steam to Put a warning up so people do not buy this version...like me...and waste good money that could be spent on a working Beat Em Up.The game it's self is marvelous! It's pure greatness, as you'd expect from SF!....But....1) The game doesn't work unless you rename a file in the game directory (The fix is at the end of my review)2 ) Once you've sorted that and launch the game...you can play fine....but.you are unable to save any progress, because Games for Windows Live is dead. So any characters you unlock are lost...I am so dissapointed by this purchase. I really was looking forward to spending a few nights unlocking content, but not like this... One can only hope Steam do something to fix this fiasco =(Personal rating: Great game, crappy services embedded into it ruining itPercent Rating: 95% if it worked properly, but as it stands 5%....---------------------------The fix to make the game launch below...1) Go to the game folder  C:\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\common\Street Fighter IV 2) Find the file in that folder StreetFighterIV.exe.cfg   3) Change it's name toStreetFighterIV.exe.cfg.BAK4) Then try to launch as normal, it should work.5) If that doesn't work, install GFWL from the exe in that same folder and try again.6) Enjoy your game till you realise you can't save progress7) OPTIONAL STEP: Curse profusely at the fact you spent good money on a broken game...:			",180,29,23,25,22,2,23

												If you're a fan of the Street Fighter franchise it is mandatory for you to pick this one up. At this point it might be better to purchase Super Street Fighter IV as it offers a bigger rooster. Also, Ultra Street Fighter IV is scheduled to be released this year around the summertime.There are not many old-school fighter games on PC these days. You have the remade Mortal Kombat, too, so there isn't really anything else out there for us PC gamers. Just make sure you have a controller as with the keyboard it is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to play the game.Interestingly, the story takes place right after Street Fighter II ended. Chronologically, the game can be put between the 2nd and 3rd episode. Bison's Shadaloo organisation still exists and organises another tournament to gather the best fighters in the world - this time, however, instead of Bison you have Seth as the final boss. Seth combines the best moves of all the players out there - he has a lot of counter special attacks, very agile and overall a pain on harder difficulty settings.Gradually, you can learn to fight with each SF character and can continue to play online. You need a lot of time and effort to master these fighters. You can unlock many more as you progress through the game.Overall, this is a really good game. When I was young my parents bought me Street Fighter II for the Super NES so for me this game was instantly captivating.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												If you're looking for a top quality 2D fighting game, you've found one with SFIV. An excellent addition to the most famous fighting game series. Welcome appearances of the major characters of old and some new ones aswell. Superb graphics and sound. Still, it is difficult to master even just one of the game's characters and you may be put off fighting the high level of online opposition.			",1920,829,74,198,246,21,315

												It was fun when it first came out. Recommend a gamepad controller. However, the game is no longer sold/supported, so recommending is not really useful. They put out a new edition that includes all the DLC. Would be nice if they offered a discount for those of us that own the old version. I'm not saying give us the game for free. But if they aren't going to make the DLC compatible with this older version, then Whiskey Tango Foxtrot you greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I'd buy the DLC if I could, but no, the publishers decided, oh old version, let's break that and force users to pay for something they already have so they can buy more stuff they don't have.

												One of the best fighting games since a long time. The graphics are beautiful, just beau-ti-ful and the fighting is fluid. I HATE the pop song that plays in the main menu and I HATE Seth. That cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I've only been able to defeat him using Zangief so far. With my amazing, god-like skills mind you. One thing I hate as well is, in case of Zangief, that I never seem to be able to pull off his Ultra combo. He ALWAYS performs his Super. What's up with that ? Like I can't press the same button 3 times in a row really fast. No, I'm not physically challenged. Dear SFIV, I spit on you ! ... ... No, I didn't mean that ! Come back, please !

												Street Figher IV is an upgraded version of the Classic Street Fighter.There is many powerful, characters in the game. You have to know what ""kind of character"" they are in ordered to beat any opponent in the game, including Seth/Akuma/Gouken. Many characters are flat like Abel, C.Viper and El Fuerte. Trying to master the concepts and moves of these 3 characters in specific, is probably one of the hardest things to do.Many other characters are easy to use and have poweful moves per hit. For example, Akuma and Gouken. These 2 characters are yet the most powerful chracter in the game besides Seth. Knowing when to use what move, and performing these moves easily, can gain you a HUGE advantage over your opponent.Finally, this game is only great to a certain extend. After unlocking Seth (which by that you have to beat arcade mode with all the characters once), the game gets boring. Beating arcade mode with all the characters including the ones you need to unlock.*SPOILER ALERT* Gouken is the hardest character to unlocked out of all of them (Fei Long, Cammy, Rose, Sakura, Dan, Gen). You have to beat arcade mode using Akuma once, then use any character you have previously beat arcade mode with, and must acheive 1 perfect round, which means you cannot take any damage from your opponent, 3 super/ultra combo finish (these add up), and 5 First-Attack rounds. Oh, most importantly, you cant use ANY continues (including Seth). After beating Seth (for the first time), Gouken will appear. He will use the cheapest moves against you, so be aware. I've unlocked Gouken on the first try after unlocking Akuma.Easiests way to unlock Gouken, is to use Akuma.*SPOILER ALERT* To unlock Akuma, you must unlock all the other characters besides Gouken (Fei Long, Cammy, Rose, Sakura, Gen, Dan). This is yet the second to the cheapest character in the entire game. His moves are powerful, easy to accomplish. His ultra and Special Combo is ONLY one button different (moving left and right). In the end, this game shows many great style of martial arts from many different countries, some even made up (M. Bison, Seth, Akuma). Great game to learn/understand the different kinds of martial arts from different countries.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the title that jumped the franchise again. Although it's only the vanilla version and you'll be better off with the Arcade one or just waiting for the Ultra Street Fighter 4 that's coming out next year, it's still a gem of fighting games. Brings back old memories spamming Hadokens and Dragon Punches! I'm not going to say I'm a good player at this, but it is fun in the end. Get it if you don't want to pay so much for the Arcade version or the Ultra that's coming out next year. Ultimately, though, get it when it's on sale. It makes it worth it. $20 for a fighting game that's having so many other versions isn't that much of a deal.8/10 when it's on sale. (:5.5/10 if not. /: happy new year guys :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wanted to play Street Fighter on my personal computer being familiar with the game considerably and am very happy to have bought this game, Street Fighter IV, despite as a result not being able to afford the superior SFV for the present time. I would recommend this as a great game to own due to its originality but also for the normal Street Fighter reasons, like to practice or improve, train and experience online battles.I would just like to add that I bought this game as a kind of prologue to the Street Fighter V level and I do not regret that at all!I would also like to add that the game does contain one negative with its age from release date now, this creating a lack in numbers of people playing online as they're no longer participating with SFIV.I must also add, as it is such a frequent debate within Street Fighter IV on PC forums, that the requirement for Games for Windows Live to be installed onto your computer and also to create an account in order to be able to make this run (An Xbox account) does create a challenge to play the game, I find this worthwhile but understand why some may not.

												This game has to be seen in motion to believe the level of fluidity it has.  It is said to be more accessible to casual gamers than previoous versions of Street Fighter, and I agree.  However, I wouldn't venture onine with this until you have a strong understanding of core game mechanics. Game controller or joysticks are all but required to play - computer keyboard will do you no justice.   Great game to have around for the 10 minute game session or when you have friends over.

Love the graphics, great multiplayer - most fun it's with your friends, because, if you will go against another players on the internet you will probably end up being spammed by little buggers which play with Ryu or Ken and they know only the Hadouken combo.

												i do not recommend this game.first of all i have to say that street fighter IV is probably the best fighting game you can play , i havein my library few more fighting games such as:injustice gods amond usthe king of fighters xiiimortal kombat kollectionmortal kombat komplete editionand street fighter iv got the best gameplay and fun.however (and thats a big however) , i do not recomend to buy this game because of capcom money suckingstrategy.first they release this game ,half year later they release an enhanced game which contain few more characters, steam blocked the enhanced game in my country so i had to buy a retail , after a year steam allow me to buy theiredition of the game.in simple words capcom force you to buy newer versions of the same game every few months (just with few more characters)and in some worst cases like street fighter x tekken they sell you incomplete game and force you to pay to unlockgame characters using DLC.i think that when a person see a new capcom game he better wait at least a year for a better version with more contentinstead of buying three games (street fighter iv,street fighter iv arcade,street fighter iv ultra edition)			",87,1,2,4,6,0,7

												This is like Street Fighter II by two times, so is like 4, Street Fighter 4 without the turbo thing that i never get, because the game didnt run faster. these game has the blonde guy, and the japanese guy who dont like each other because they both are very good at beating womans like chinese girls, and girls in spandex clothes. The thing is that these two guys dont like each other, but deeper we know that they really admire and have a little gay love goind around. And this guy in the military style outfit who has a flamable fap hand is their enemy because the military guys dont like interracial happy sadomasochistic gay couples though they beat womans, and thats fine for him but not good enough, so he wants these guys stop seeing each other, and the rest of the people are those who are on the side of the military or the gay couple.

												Everything nostalgic and classic from SF2 while having all of the modern bells and whistles to mix into a great game.Edit, I wrote this review on June 23 2011, and as of November 2013, the multiplayer servers are completely 100% empty.  People have moved on to Super Street Fighter 4 Champion Platinum's Turbo X2 Alpha Strike Collector's Limited Special Edition Gold.  Or whatever the ♥♥♥♥.  All that's left here is GFWL achievements to single player.  I managed to get like 10/48, the rest of them are challenge mode.  You have to be autistic or something to pull off the combos.  I'm not talking about Ryu's Hadouken, I'm talking about some advanced♥♥♥♥♥♥that you don't have the fingers for if you're over 8.Bottom line, if you really want to play Street Fighter, get the new one that everyone plays.

												I was kinda looking forward to this game and eventualy was disappointed. The controls are not that great and even the gameplay and difficulty are needed to be set on very easy just to enjoy the game. The AI is also very annoying as it has repetetive moves all the time. I wouldn't reccomend buying this game, I bought it to play with my friends but I didn't enjoy it. If you want a SF title just buy the Arcade or Ultra edition.			",171,16,7,12,5,1,6

												As a fan of the franchise, I expected more from this game than I got, I am aware of the newer version, and I would definitely recommend staying away from this one.You will find next to no one online, a long wait will end up queueing you with someone from taiwan at 500ping.The single player is ok, but like most games transfered from console to PC, the controls are clunky, and the game is quite short.This version is a pretty big waste of your money and won't reward you with many hours of gameplay, in my opinion.

			Super Street Fighter 4 Ryu Ultra 1 Metsu Hadouken		

 It. Occured to me a METSU-HADUKEN was not informative enough. I completely forgot the review. Huh. Funny. Anyway, I enjoyed the game, except it's biggest flaw is that it's really not all that enjoyable without some controller. A.K.A. playing on a keyboard sucks. Plus they keep spitting out new versions, so that kinda goes against it too. I would just wait for the next one. ULTRA SUPER ULTRA ULTIMATE STREET FIGHTER ULTRA IV			",100,11,0,6,9,3,13

												{Overt sarcasm} Just what the world needs...yet another overpriced Street Fighter game. Yay...Plus: The fight mechanics are a lot like the other SF games. Very familiar.        The graphics are great.Cons: This is the same game it was 20 years ago. Why does it still cost so much?          DLC from Street Fighter should be free. Yet, they charge for extras that should've been included from the start.It's a great game but buy it during a special sale. You be glad you waited for all the extras to come out. As usual, there will always be various ""Edtions"" of SF that you'll have to pay the FULL price for.			",198,35,0,4,7,1,0

I had my Problems beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta Seth (the last boss) even at the lowest difficulty setting. I've lost like countless Times on my First try with each Char.

												Seriously, this game is amazing. Even if you've never played a fighting game before I can still reccomend this. It's responsive, balanced, and gorgeous. The combat is both fast-paced and strategic and while it does take a while to learn everything, it is well worth it. The combos and strategies you need to perform are easy to learn, but hard to master. This means you will spend a lot of the game knowing what you are doing, but working hard to get better, my favorite kind of system. This isn't like Marvel vs Capcom where you need to train you eyes to just to understand what is going on on-screen and master insanely difficult combos, not that that's a bad thing. This is the kind of game that is fun, challenging, and you can spend hours upon hours playing.			",92,13,0,7,6,0,3

												A modern classic. While a bit more glitchy than its console counterpart, the formula that makes the combat so dynamic and exciting is still present in full form. While it takes a while to learn the ropes, progress in this game is particularily rewarding due to the 'in your face' nature of the combat. There's nothing like pulling off an ultra at the right time and obliterating half your opponents life bar. Best fighting game on the block.			",106,5,2,3,1,0,9

												Not bad, unfortunately there is no support from Capcom. PC version faulty, with no 2 player keyboard support. Indepedant peeps have created work arounds, but they are not 100%. Good fun with and X-Arcade controller when guests are around.			",136,15,0,11,10,3,16

												Waste of god damn money. Not only do I have problems connecting online multiplayer, but several other people, as well. Since I cannot connect online I cannot get any new characters nor can I play with friends. What a total waste of ♥♥♥♥ing money.			",74,10,0,3,5,0,15

												I spent years and years at the arcade playing this game.  If you love the series or fighting games in general I can not gurantee this game enough.  Great single player stories for each fighter, and the best fighting multi player game to date.  A Must Have if you love the series.			",124,22,3,24,0,0,6
