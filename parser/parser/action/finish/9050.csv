												In 2004, when Doom 3 was released, it was a glimpse into the future. The game represented a huge leap in visual fidelity and even manages to hold up well today, over a decade later. Furthermore, the sound design is unsurpassed and really immerses the player in the experience. The environmental storytelling with audio logs and emails was way ahead of its time and would be replicated in future blockbusters such as Bioshock. It is a true testament to how ahead of its time this game was in 2004 that it holds up so well today. I would highly recommend purchasing this version of Doom 3 over the BFG edition. First and foremost, the game was originally designed to have the player balance his use of flashlight and weapons. The BFG edition removes this gameplay element by allowing the player to use the flashlight and any weapon at the same time, removing some challenge from the game. The visual updates to the BFG edition are not substantial, search out comparison videos on YouTube for confirmation. This version will run perfect in 16:9 widescreen despite not having any 16:9 resolution options in the menu (requires modifying a .txt file).I really enjoyed playing this game again (last time I played was 2004). Campaign took me 11.2 hours on medium difficulty without rushing through. The campaign is much longer than many contemporary AAA FPS games. This game has held up incredibly well and is still excellent in 2015. Highly recommended for any FPS fans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm going to give Doom 3 an actual recommendation because I really think it is one of the more underrated games. Doom 3 is iD's attempt to revitalize the classic Doom series 10 years later. Doom 3 departs from the ""explore the floor"" style of older Doom games and is instead an attempt at a more linear/scripted action-horror game that was in my opinion pretty successful. The engine is a bit dated so the monsters don't have the frightening look going for them like the ones in newer games, but there's a great atmosphere that the game fosters of an invisible entity orchestrating the events happening around you. Most of the ""spooks"" come from the lights going out or the game applying the overused red filter to the display and then having a bunch of monsters come at you. While not nearly as frightening as Frictional's horror games (Penumbra/Amnesia), the approach to horror it takes is closer to those games than something like Dead Space, which is more like ""monsters jump out at you as a loud noise plays: the game"". While there are a few ""jump"" bits in the game, most of what made me enjoy Doom 3 was the atmosphere and the background noise that contributed to the experience. The gameplay overall is closer to Quake II than Doom, with the more linear format but still having little secrets around you can find. Overall a decent successor to Doom in my opinion.

												Doom 3 is a game that is very overlooked. It was Id's flagship title and features a very powerful game engine. It contained enhancements such as dynamic lighting, physics, bump mapping, portal technology among many other things we now take for granted. This was all months prior to Half Life 2 wowing us for the same thing.Doom 3 is essentially a remake or reboot of the series. It shares virtually the same premise as the original Doom, except set on Mars instead of it's moons. In a way this sort of gives the game it's own style but makes it feel less original. The aesthetic of the game was nailed very well, however the levels do get very samey after a while. For the vast majority of the game you're mostly running through maze-like corridors looking for ways to open doors. This was the first game I remember where I started to notice maze-like level design felt antiquated. I always kind of wished this game was more open and less claustraphobic.The game is still a horror game so they introduced dark environments with enemies shuffling around them. It also took a very bold risk where the player's flashlight is a separate weapon you equip. I personally like this mechanic but a lot of people, especially at the time hated it. And it was a frequent source of ridicule for the game. The gunplay in Doom 3 is something I never particularly liked, especially compared to it's successor Quake 4. The pistol is a joke that is never used after you get the shotgun, the shotgun is what you use for 70% of the game, the machine gun's firing sound effect makes it sound like a cap gun, the chaingun is very slow and cumbersome, the rocket launcher is extremely cool but only used on bigger enemies, and the plasma gun feels too slow to be useful. This was all corrected with very fantastic modifications but at the time I can understand why people didn't like it.In a way that's why I recommend this game. The engine Doom 3 used allowed it to be very heavily modified. There are a great deal of very good total conversion mods for the game, and it allowed Doom 3 to live on in our collective consciousness despite the game being only ""okay"". I do recommend the game for it's modifications more than anything else since that is what this game is most remembered for.

												Damn that was a REALLY long single player  campaign by today's standards,  it lasted around ~ 11 hrs while most of the fights were pretty easy to get through on  first try (must stop playing multiplayer FPSs lol )   heck even the final boss fight was VERY easy to beat ! i remembered this game 10 years ago to be hard as hell, maybe  the good old 6800gt was not very fast,  it only gave me  sub-60fps and lots of mouselag, higher systems specs = higher skill ceiling  :p  Anyway it still holds up REALLY well, the lighting the sound system ( don't get the BFG version, those greedy Bethesda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s  replaced  openAL + EAX support  with  a sub-bar software accelerated  audio engine :S ) the gunplay, EVERYTHING looks and feels so smooth ! ,you can  even use  sound mods for that extra ""oopmh""  added to gunfire and/or get the total package with the absolute HD  mod, which replaces 90% of the game's textures adds DOF HDR  etc.Played the vanilla version from start to finish with no mods whatosever,  GOTY 2004 if you ask me, sorry  HL2 kids !

												Doom 3.DOOM 3.D00M 3.What else is there to say about this unbelievablly awesome First Person Shooter/Survival Horror game?This is possibly the greatest Reboot (Except for Wolfenstein the new order) ever made.The story is good. Even though it's the same story as before, it is expanded on here: there is a whole deep narrative and sci-fi lore that is both mysterious, and exciting, without really getting in the way of the gameplay.The voice acting, while ham-fisted, is awesome,The Writing is great, as it was written the author Matthew J. Costello, and the story feels like something out of a science fiction epic, like Dune and Star Trek.The ambiet noise & atmousphere? I know there are a LOT of games with good ambiet noise, but D00M 3 WINS HANDS DOWN, BEST AMBIET NOISE IN ANY VIDEOGAME MADE OR GOING TO BE MADE EVER. There are so manny sounds atop of sounds atop of sounds underneith sounds ATOP OF SOUNDS, some you don't even hear; they're just THERE.  This extends to the Music.  Now it may look like there are only a few songs, but what you don't realise is that the ENVIRONMENT tells the music. You can hear the oxygen cycle and refreash the room you are in, and the chiming and grunting of machinery can make for some really interesting and creative music and sound.  It's the kind of stuff that you just don't see in videogames anymore.The horror? Well, it may be cheezy, unoriginal, & full of jump-scares (Not jump-shocks or slender BS), but it feels VERY original for the time and since Doom was scary back in the day, you can't really critique this game for trying.The opening is well paced, and it set's the mood for the game quite well. Even though Half-Life did it first, D00M 3 does an EXCELLENT job of it too, and sets you up for the odyssey ahead.Plus that awesome Super Turbo Turkey Puncher 3 game cabinent is more then enough to get you hooked.The enemy designs are awesome: All (well, 85%) of the original monsters are back, with a few new original ones (Those Zombie Commandos)D00M 3 also has a HUUUUUUUUUUGE campaign length. Beating it would take roughly 12-17 hours to complete. What was that Killzone Shadow fall? only a 4 hour campaign??The Weapons are ALL the same from Doom 1 & 2 (abiet updated ones), but you get a Machine gun to use (A good mid-range weapon), Grenades (Bouncy-Bouncy-Bouncy: hard to control but effective) & a Flashlight (Oh yeah...)The game is VERY dark. That's one of it's selling points & why you should get D00M 3 & not the BFG edition: It's much more darker, & you can hold EITHER a flashlight or a gun. It might come off as annoying at first, but it sinks in, & it adds to the scare factor.Keep in mind this is a VERY different DooM game, up to the point where people question if it is a DooM game at ALL. But whatever you may think about D00M 3, it sold more than 5.3 million copies, making it the most successful game by it's developer id Software to date.I VERY HIGHLY recommend D00M 3 to anyone who likes FPS, anyone who likes Horror-survival, & pretty much to anyone who loves video games in general.This is a MUST PLAY5/5Editors Note: If you are going to play it, I highly recommend getting the Absolute HD mod for free off of Mod DB when playing this game: it makes it look a bit better, & it allows for modern resolutions without having to use the console commands.

												Doom 3 is a no-holds barred, adrenaline pumped thrill ride; I've never played a game that's kept me quite on the edge of my seat or has had me gripping my mouse as tightly as this one. Doom 3 is scary, fast paced and frantic, and I highly recommend it.This game is a first person shooter that has the player taking control of a Marine on Mars, who is forced to confront demons from Hell itself as they launch the space station on Mars into complete chaos; the story does not get much more complex and this, but hey, this is a Doom game, and I've never played the Doom series for story.The game plays like many other games of the genre, with the player using guns to survive through each level; a simple premise, but effective, and shooting is well crafted here, considering this is what the Doom series is known for. All of the guns handle well and each kill feels satisfying and earned, and each fight will leave you feeling oddly relieved.The atmosphere and sound design in this game is also quite good. Rather than hammering the player with an over the top musical score, this game prefers to use ambience to set the tone; creaks and groans of a decaying space station is far more effective at keeping the player on the edge of their seat. I found the dark environments great, as they left me in confusion as to where the next enemy would appear.My only complaint would be that this game is rather short, and the multiplayer is non-existent nowadays. These are small complaints in comparison to the immeasurable quality of gaming that Doom 3 provides, and I recommend it highly to both novices and veterans of the first person shooter scene. 9 / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom 3 with the OpenCo-op mod is a blast. The game feels made for Co-Op; one of  you holds a light and the other takes the shots. The campaign is quite long and furthermore the game still manages to scare you every now and then, even playing with friends. It's a testament to the quality of the game. Furthermore, the game is beautiful for being nearly 10 years old. It certainly doesn't show it. The co-op mod can be a little unpolished at times but the enjoyment helds smooth over any rough patches.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My favorite horror game, mainly because it's simultaniously a horror game AND an action game, meaning that even once the horror element wears off (the death knell of any traditional horror game), the fast paced action, great gunplay, lots of exploration, huge variety of enemies and weapons helps keep the game fun even years later. This is essentially the best Aliens game ever made. Captures the atmosphere and tone perfectly, and the supernatural twist with demons from HELL just makes it even better.Highly recommended!

												My opinion of this game has improved greatly over time.  After my first play-through, I would have described this as the most overrated game ever.  I thought that the game was too dark, too narrow, and too difficult.  In retrospect, I didn't give Doom 3 a completely fair shake.  On that first play-through, I immediately cranked up the gamma, I clung stubbornly to my two favorite weapons in every combat situation, and I resorted to cheat-codes to get me through large portions of the game.  I also mostly ignored the various computer screens and audio logs and just barreled forward as quickly as possible.I kept hearing other people rave about the game though, so I gave it a second chance and then a third chance.  And each time I've played it, I've enjoyed it a bit more.  I started taking my time, carefully choosing different weapons for different situations, and savoring the story told through the audio logs and emails.  At this point I feel that some of my initial criticisms were accurate while others were unfair.One of the controversial decisions the game designers made was to make you switch between your flashlight and weapon.  When I first got the game, on the recommendation of friends, I immediately installed a mod to enable the flashlight at all times.  However, on subsequent play-throughs I decided to play the game as it was intended, and I have to admit it does make many sections of the game a lot scarier.  However I do think the game goes too far in how dark it keeps everything.  It's one thing to include a few pitch-black sections, but even the brightest sections of this game are ridiculously dark; heck, even the first chapter--when the base is fully operational--is pretty dark.  I'm not sure if this was done to try to make the game scarier or to emphasize the strengths of the graphics engine, but either way I think it was a mistake not to include some well-lit areas.The graphics are, of course, very good.  They didn't make my jaw drop the way I expected (based on the pre-release hype), but it's certainly the best looking game of its time and the graphics engine is rock solid.  The levels are pretty large, load times are surprisingly short, and my frame-rate was always smooth as can be.  The graphics also appear to scale well to both older and newer systems.  There were a few innovative visual effects that I liked, such as when you stood at the edge of a steaming lava pit or looked through a thick window pane.It's clear that an effort was made to give Doom 3 a more realistic feel than the original Doom, and this is most obvious when comparing the new look of the monsters to what they used to look like.  An unfortunate downside is that the new enemies have less personality and are less distinctive from one another than they used to be.  In particular, I dislike the texture that was used for the skin of almost every monster - is it flesh? hide? carbon-fiber?  I thought it looked a little too shiny and inorganic.  But those minor complaints aside, the new enemy designs are pretty convincing and some of them are downright frightening to see up close.Where the game disappointed me most was in the level design, especially in the early sections of the game.  What I disliked was how small and confined every area was.  In the first third of the game, every single fight takes place in a narrow hallway or cramped office.  It gets a little better later in the game, but not much better.  Even the boss fights take place in surprisingly small areas, and the brief 'outdoor' sections are a joke.  The facility you are exploring feels like a real-world location, but there isn't much diversity between the various areas of the base, and there are very few sections that wowed me.  Remember how when you first played Half-Life, you experienced a ""holy s---!' moment around ever corner?  There are very few of those type of awe inspiring moments in Doom 3.Another major complaint I have about this game is the way that bullets bounce off of objects, surfaces, and even enemies in a very unconvincing manner.  Almost none of the environment is destructible.  Computer screens appear to be bullet-proof, office knick-knacks all seem to be glued to desks, and windows survive even the largest explosions.  Furthermore, ricocheting bullets sound the same whether you are shooting a window, a metal girder, or a zombie's flesh.  And worst of all, aside from some blood spatters (which it's too dark to see anyway), there isn't much feedback on whether you are damaging the monster you're fighting or not.  In the original Doom, shooting any of the smaller enemies would cause them to groan and stagger backwards; in Doom 3 they shrug it off and keep charging.  This hampers the gameplay significantly and results in all of the guns feeling less powerful than they really are.Once you get into the rhythm of the game and familiar with the various enemies, the combat is pretty satisfying.  Some people might find it repetitious by the end, but I never got tired of it.  And now that I've played the game a few times on a few different difficulties, I feel comfortable stating that the difficulty is actually very well balanced.  There are nine different weapons available, with different strengths and weaknesses.  A few of the guns are overpowered in my opinion, but none of them are completely useless.  (The chainsaw is back, and is as much fun to use as ever.)Despite the linear nature of the level design, the pacing of the enemy encounters is well planned.  Instead of putting a monster behind every corner, there are plenty of sections with no enemies which builds up suspense nicely.  There are also a lot of well scripted encounters with waves of enemies teleporting in all around you.  The one mistake the game makes, however, is delivering certain enemies too often and others not often enough.  Some of the more interesting demons barely make an appearance, while the imps show up again and again and again in every stage of the game.Doom 3 will probably take you around 20 hours to complete.  The story and the way the story is told borrows a lot from both Half-Life and System Shock 2.  The game gives you access to various characters' emails and audio logs through a PDA interface.  Technically, you could play through the entire game without ever opening your PDA, but if you do so you'll miss out, since most of the game's storytelling happens through the email and audio logs you find.  Many of the email messages are typical mundane office chatter that simply give you a sense of what life was like on the base before your arrival, while the audio logs document recent events that led up to the horror you are now experiencing.  Together, they help to give a bit of background and life to the otherwise barren environments.  (And the writing and voice acting are both very good.)One feature I really liked was how the game lets you interact with computer screens (to open doors, operate machinery, etc.); as you get close to a screen, your crosshair changes to a mouse cursor, while still centered where you are looking.  It's a very simple thing, but I've never seen another game handle 'use' buttons quite this elegantly.Finally, I was surprised to see that this game limits you to only run in short bursts, and that you need to hold down a key to do so.  This is a feature that would make sense in a tactical shooter, but it seems out of place in the Doom series, where half your time is spent dodging fireballs.In conclusion: I don't think I've ever had my opinion of a game improve so drastically over the years.  I still think Doom 3 is slightly overrated; it's not in the same league as the games it most resembles - Doom, Half-Life, and System Shock 2.  But it is a solid gaming experience that I would recommend to anyone, especially to hard-core FPS players and fans of horror. (If you are offended by demonic images or excessive gore you should probably stay away.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have no regrets in spending 28 hours to this game. Over 13 years have passed since its release, and i never played it before.I think i missed one of the best games ever made.Stunning graphics, chilling atmosphere, brutal monsters, powerful weapons - you can see everything in it no matter how much years will pass.Indeed a great game, as shooter and as one of Doom games. I have no clue why people are hatin' on it just because it's not pulling out arcades.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The forefather of first person shooters as we know it saw reinvention and rebirth some 11 years after it first revolutionized (if not invented) the genre of FPS. What Id Software brought to the table was a game-changing new graphics engine that pushed real-time lighting and 3D-relief ""bump mapped"" textures to polygon graphics; ultimately this game made startlingly real environments to serve as the Martian horrorhouse that became the setting of what was to be not a true sequel, but a reboot of the series. Doom 3 came across as a more cinematic and survival horror-themed take on the tale of one lone soldier's struggle to contain the hordes of Hell after a science experiment let them out across an isolated research station on Mars. They vied to reach Earth where they could take a more permanent hold on the mortal realm, but with an almost academic arsenal of firepower and a few tricks, the player must drive them back, eventually entering Hell itself to seal the hole created in reality from the other side. Open environments with color-coded locked doors and a maze-like construction gave way to linear progression through a much darker and more claustrophic base. The backtracking of the original games was replaced with a series of ""boo"" moments as demons jumped from every vent, doorway, and even materialize around, behind, or sometimes right on top of the player. Suspense and hair-trigger gameplay replace the circle-strafing constant-action of the originals, while a much stronger focus on story, both told in cinematics and collectable audio logs, certainly made this modern iteration of Doom more of an interactive thrill ride than before.The sheer darkness of the game can be overcome with a little bit of config file tweaking, as can the game's orignial 4:3 aspect ratio, field of view, and resolution options (make sure to set the config file as read-only after modding or it will revert), but players of more recent shooters will cry at this game's lack of weapon shouldering or even any kind of appreciable zoom aiming. The ""monster closets"" get a bit old after a few hours in, and the scare factor is thus reduced, but the game's atmosphere is the stuff of legend, especially in the way it makes players choose between wielding their flashlight and seeing what's hiding in every blackened corner, or firing at those glowing eyes in the darkness and hoping whatever it is doesn't eat you.The ""BFG Edition"" of this game released almost  8 years after the original adds a new episode consisting of recently-finished levels cut from the original game, but otherwise removes some of the more suspensful encounters, plus ups the enemy count, reduces their health, and increases ammo in order to make a more action-heavy shooter. These things diminish the horror feel, especially in the way the game mounts the flashlight onto the armor, so players can shoot and see in the dark simultaneously, but this I feel takes away from what the game was all about: fear of the unknown. Plus ""BFG Edition"" also presets the widescreen mode and higher resolutions by default, which is handy, but increases gamma and brightness to higher levels by default, and even pumps up the lighting itself in game, further eroding the horror feel. Finally, some of the original game's shadow rendering were replaced with softer techniques, which is a bummer. I get what Id Software was trying to do here with the BFG edition, but it didn't really need to be done. If the idea of optional motion blur, higher frame rate caps (120fps max),  or perhaps a bit more saturated color palette borrowed from the more-recent Rage engine, with -some- cleaned up textures sounds good to you, then maybe the BFG Edition is worth checking out. Otherwise, the original game holds up enough over time to still be a great suspenseful take on the 90's classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If, by chance, you find yourself interested in trying out Doom 3, buy this version instead of BFG Edition, since the latter, besides being a power-hog and having removed the crucial gameplay element of constant switch-over between the weapon and flashlight, is, most importantly, has broken the ammo conserving mechanics by DOUBLING the amount of ammo you get per magazine you've picked up (you literally can never run out of bullets here)So, this version plays better, several times cheaper and can actually look much better with one simple tweak. Open a notepad, paste following (relevant for 16:9, 1080p resolution):set r_mode -1set r_customWidth 1920set r_customHeight 1080set image_lodbias ""-1.0""set image_anisotropy 8set r_multiSamples 0set r_aspectRatio 1seta com_videoRam ""2048""seta image_useCache ""0""seta image_roundDown ""0""seta image_usePrecompressedTextures ""0""seta image_useCompression ""0""seta image_useNormalCompression “0”seta image_downSizeLimit ""0""seta image_ignoreHighQuality ""0""seta image_downSizeBumpLimit ""0""seta image_downSizeSpecularLimit ""0""seta image_downSizeBump ""0""seta image_downSizeSpecular ""0""seta image_downSize ""0""seta image_forceDownSize ""0""seta image_roundDown ""0""And save it as Autoexec.cfg in game folder ,,,\steamapps\common\Doom 3\base\You can additionally set the antialiasing, but it is highly recommended to do so in your GPU driver control panel.There - you got yourself the BFG edition widescreen fix with a crisper image and without broken gameplay mechanics.

												Let me list the good and bad things about this game.First, this game has horrifying maps. I mean that in a good and bad way. It's scary, yes, but it also has these horrible twisting and looping maps that are so dark it's impossible to get through. Also when you first start the game, the weapons you have make pitiful attempts to injure some of the stronger enemies like Imps, though it gets better once you find more powerful weapons.Now the good things.If you're a fan of the original DOOM games, than YES BUY THIS! It's really fun for a DOOM fan to experience. It's awesome seeing the old pixelated monsters come to life in this game. Also, this game is truly terrifying. The darkness, and the constant demonic noises coming from your intercom make you barely have the courage to walk through the game. Overall, as a DOOM fan, I've enjoyed it. If you're new to the DOOM series, then go with the old ones, and see if you want to carry on with the epic saga of violence.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DOOM 3 is a really cool game. It's a good reboot of the original DOOM from 1993. You will recognize all the enemies from the original game. I played it in it's vanilla form and still after all these years, DOOM 3 surprised me with it's graphics. DOOM 3 is really the best looking game from 2004, it looks still today really good, even vanilla. Yeah, on some textures you can see, that it is a 2004 game, but with mods you can improve everything.The sound is really nice. Exactly what you should expect from such a horror game. The menu theme is rocky and badass. I like that.I Finished the game after 20 hours of gameplay. A steam friend said to me, he played almost 12 hours, so I was maybe to busy with exploring the world and reading the PDAs? Anyway, it was fun. Some visual changes would be nice, but what do you expect from a base on mars? Of course its dark and alone there.I enjoyed this version a lot. I bought the BFG edition only for ""The Lost Missions"" and the ""DOOM II: No Rest for the Living"". The BFG edition would destroy some horror moments, when you are able to wear the flashlight and your weapon at the same time.I look forward to continue playing DOOM 3 with mods.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Screw BFG Edition, original DOOM 3 is better. A lot of people are complaining about original, because it's too much darker or screen resolutions problem, learn to open settings and set your screen size, BFG dummies. DOOM 3 is very good game, it's designed to be a dark horror survival game,but BFG maked more lighter which is just not fun to be scared. BFG Edition is just full of bugs and it has Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 which are in another words broken games. BFG versions of Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 are just f*****g c**p. Why? Because they censored red crosses of health packs with pills and removed in Doom 2 two Wolfenstein levels: WW2 Nazi soldiers, flags, Hitler portraits,etc. and it reminds like non textured level from Bubsy 3D. When I played Doom 3 BFG Edition at my friend's house, I thought is this another beta versions of all Doom games?! If you wanna get all DOOM games, buy classic complete and Doom 3 pack and stay the F**K out of the BFG Edition. BTW, DOOM 3 BFG EDITION HOW I PLAYED IT I THINK IT IS ONLY FOR GERMANS ( I'm, not against Germans, btw), glitchy and non-scary and censored, because it's designed for them. Nowadays people got so scared on some new games and don't like old scary games to be scared, get real people!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this in November of 2016. It took me about 17 hours to do a play through. I was really pleased with how well this game aged.  Graphically, it could do with some texture packs, and the lighting effects were probably awesome in the day, but they're a little dated. But it's still alright. The gameplay is good solid pre-Halo FPS. There are probably only about 8 enemy types, plus bosses. They are mostly simpler, and the challenge comes from getting your health widdled down through the level. (Although the easier difficulties are pretty easy).  I remember when the game came out, there were two controversies: The Flashlight, and Monster Closets. Yes, the game used a whole lot of the best lighting effects it had available, and showed them off. Lots of places are poorly lit or completely dark, and you need to use a flashlight, and you can't have the flashlight and a gun at the same time. I get why it bugged people, but I enjoyed it. The enemies are simpler (especially in the flashlight-intensive areas), and it adds some suspsense and challenge. Monster Closets (that is, there are little closets all over the place that just hide enemies so they can jump out at you from behind later). Monster Closets did start to annoy me, but again, that is how pre-Halo FPSs worked. It helped with the immersion, because I was listening for enemies to come up behind me, and then when you get to rooms with loud machines in it, it was a lot more tense. I recommend the game, it's cheap, and it's fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL:DR A great Game, even if it's a complete 180 from all the other games in the series.Full Review: Firstly, I would like to say, this game is completely different from every other game in the Series, so don't go in expecting a fast-paced, non-linear FPS game. Instead, this is a slower, more linear, and more atmospheric horror game. With that being said, not only do these changes help to give the game deeper claws to keep its grasp on you, but the first half of the game (Up to and including the hell level, for those curious) is pure horror, all the way. For those worried though, The game returns towards (but not all the way to) the classic formula in the 2nd half of the game, while still mixing in some horror elements.Graphically, it looks fantastic for the time, and still looks good today, even if the polygon count reveals the game's true age (that last part may be due to the fact that I'm transitioning to PC gaming from Consoles...). The action is still DOOM at its core, although you'll need to pay more attention your ammo, as reloading is a thing in this game. One annoying issue, however, is that the game is very dark (again, especially in the first half of the game), which, while adding to the scare quotient, means that you can have issues when firing at demons in the darker rooms. You can easily switch between gun and flashlight using ""F"", but ideally, the game (probably) is expecting you to use your memory with the flashlight, and your hearing to attack the demons when you can't see it (I say this because the reticule turns red when you sucessfully deal damage to an enemy).If that does sound too annoying, you have 3 options:1. Install the ""Duct Tape"" mod (Google it, Adds a flashlight to the shotgun and the machine gun).2. Skip this version of the game, and get the BFG edition (Adds a temporary flashlight to use while holding any weapon).3. Train your memory and hearing, to get used to it (For best results with the scare quotient).Personally, I went with 1 at first, before switching to 3 later on (Because the game took away my guns and flashlight (and presumably my duct tape) at the start of the hell level, and I decided to play fair). If I had the money, I'd probably get the BFG edition, which also includes the previous two games as well!Regardless of what edition you pick up, and whether or not you decide to use the Duct Tape mod, You'll be pleasently surprised on how far id goes from the Traditional DOOM formula and still deliver a great, if somewhat flawed, experience.

												Don't be mistaken, DOOM 3 is in no way meant to be a successor to the original Doom games. But that doesn't at all mean it's a bad game, persay. Some may lambast it for being different, but it's no DNF for sure. For one thing, DOOM 3's gameplay takes a slower pace than the last two games in the series and benefits greatly from this change. No longer are you speeding through levels, never taking one look backwards at the scene. Instead, the game builds up it's mood to supplement it's slower action. Weapons mostly share the same functions as the old set from the originals and mostly feel like the original weapons in terms of gunplay. However, it adds a new variable in late game that rewards players for sustained killstreaks. However, the rocket launcher lose it's secondary utility in the closed-off levels. Now, the enemy AI seems rather one-note. Basic zombies merely walk at a snail's pace towards the player, making it incredibly easy to pick them off at range. Imps merely run after the player, throwing homing fireballs all the while in combination with melee attacks. But the Z-Sec and the Commando shows that their AI at least has some competency in it's making, if they're not very advanced. They make use of cover, strafe around and make ample use of manuevers in their combat. If I could make a comparison, they fight like the HECU from the original Half Life.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom3, the only game that had me jumping a couple of times, even during replays, stopped counting at a dozen (got a physical copy, just bought on steam for the convienience). Amazing atmosphere and cool action, best played on Veteran difficulty and later on Nightmare.This original version is so much better than the BGF edition, gameplay wise, and especially because of the mod support. Visually still great, if you get one of the amazing graphic mods like sikkmod with Wulfen's HD textures, or just Redux - look it up on MODDB - which has different HD textures already included and an already configured sikkmod, plus a couple of enhanced weapon sounds and a new menu.Tons of custom maps - single map style or campaign like - are available and ofc the already mentioned mods and more. Even a coop modification.Of the non graphic mods I can fully recommend the ""In Hell Directors Cut"" mod; 20+ maps with fast old doom gameplay style - no stamina limitation for running, secrets, clever level structures, no flashlight, secret levels - set in hell. Utterly brilliant and like a game on it's own right.Oh, and there's even some MP alive, well, to a certain extent at least.To set it to widescreen simply edit your config:seta r_customHeight ""1080""  -  whatever your resolution isseta r_customWidth ""1920"" -    whatever your resolution isseta r_mode ""-1""seta r_aspectRatio ""1""More than worth it's money!

												***I WROTE THIS REVIEW IN November of 2006... Found it on my HD and reposted it because I felt it still holds up- hope you enjoy it*To set the record straight, Doom 3 is hardly a sequel in the sense that none of the events of a Mars invaded Hell ever occurred. Think of it as a Doom adaptation. You are a Marine landing on the surface of Mars at a military research base reporting to your officer for orders. When you arrive you find you are to report to a lab to escort a scientist back to the military headquarters. So you grab a weapon and make your way down the dark passages of laboratories where civilian crewmembers are ominously talking about people who have mysteriously disappeared or have heard voices; hinting that something BIG is about to happen. When you finally meet up with the scientist, something goes terribly wrong and the forces of hell are released while demons pass through portals and soldiers are possessed across the red planet.For the next twenty minutes the game unleashes the best scare tactics and sequences of events I have ever experienced in a horror video game. But not only is game brilliant in scaring the crap out of you, the dark facility level design is absolutely perfect. Lights flicker as your fellow marines are screaming over the radio. Muffled sounds of shouts and gunfire on other side of walls or even demonic arms reaching through the walls all cause you to walk through each corridor cautiously with an itchy trigger finger.Gameplay:Upon your arrival on Mars, you are handed your very own PDA which you use throughout the game to acquire passwords to cabinets, open doors, read scientist's e-mail and voicemail and even watch videos that describe different areas of maps. Reading other scientist's e-mail is important throughout the game for they sometimes describe weakness in enemies and even reveal hidden stashes to ammo and health packs.So you have your PDA, what else do you need? Oh yeah, a flashlight. A flashlight? Yes a flashlight. To make Doom 3 scarier than it already is, the creators equipped our voiceless, nameless marine with a flashlight to check out those dark scary corners. But the catch is you cannot bear any weapons while you hold your flashlight. This means if there is indeed a zombie lurking in the shadows you better switch to your shotty quick!The weapons in Doom 3 are almost what you would expect from the original game. You start off with a meager handgun, upgrade to the shotgun, which upgrades to an assault gun, the basic 1, 2, 3 step formula in any FPS. What, you think they're gonna start you off with the BFG? As you progress, you eventually have the entire arsenal from the original Doom plus something special the creators added in the later portions. About half way through the game, the brilliant scripted sequences start to fade away and Doom 3 becomes more of a repetitive brainless shooter. Demons become less scary (even the newer ones) and you will start to predict where doors will open and how to handle the situations that are supposed to be tough. (that occurs when doors close and you are trapped in a room with 37 demons) What happened to the dazzling writing we saw in the game's opening?There was also one tribute to Doom the creators added that I absolutely love. Do you remember playing the original Doom, and sometimes when an imp fired one of it's fireballs at you and a possessed marine got in the way, the marine would start attacking the imp? Well I used to see how many enemies I could wake up and just run around the map for 10-15 minutes seeing how many enemies would die without me firing a single shot. Well Doom 3 also kept the same demons fighting demons portion, which made me laugh the first time I saw it. Too bad the maps in Doom 3 aren't square and rectangular like they used to be, it's a lot harder to run away from enemies.Graphics:I can't begin to express my satisfaction when I double clicked the Doom 3 icon on my desktop and watched the opening cut scene. From that point on the smooth textures and unique dark/bright lighting produces an amazing environment to battle demons. I also loved as you approach a cut scene, the camera pauses as your character continues to walk forward giving you an outer body experience as the cut scene begins. This happens every time a new monster is introduced over the course of the game. The cut scene ends when the camera seamlessly zooms into the back of your characters head, into is current vision. Very well done.Multiplayer:I know most people are not buying Doom 3 for the multiplayer experience but this is 2006 and games today pretty much come standard with multiplayer options. How many games today have an incredible single player story AND incredible multiplayer gameplay (or modification)? It is obvious Id concentrated entirely on the single player aspect and at the last minute threw in a small multiplayer option where you can join servers that supports up to 4 players. A tribute to old school Doom multiplayer maybe? Back when you had to dial your friend on your 14.4 kbps modem and run around shooting each other? Even if it is, the enjoyment quickly diminishes over time... exponentially! In fact, I can't find a reason to ever play Doom 3 MP again. The dark maps and quick paced gameplay does not translate well into multiplayer gaming even if there are only four players in a server. .Pros: Corridor shooter with heavy emphasis on unpredicted scares. Cons: Weak multiplayer, formulaic advance through game, well thought out scares turn into mundane annoyances.Bottom Line: A dark and morbid FPS like nothing you've ever seen. Interesting story and impressive real time action shots that will make your jaw drop. The Doom 3 engine however has room for improvement in an environment that only works for this genre of gameplay.

												Last great game by id Software, if you are a true pc player, buy this instead of the so-called ""BFG Edition"" console port, the latter is simply not worth it.I've beaten this game countless of times, recently re-bought it during Quakecon sale just to share some pics, with the latest sikkmod and wulfen texture max out, the game still looks amazing. Keep in mind though, this is an openGL game so regular DirectX tweaks might not work, luckily there're tons of mods to customize it, provided you have enough hardware power to run them.If you want this on Steam, I suggest picking this and RoE expansion during next sale for less than 3.5 bucks, then install the latest graphic mods, play this at night with lights off, and let your soul burn in hell! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not as 'old school' as Doom 1 and 2, Doom 3 in itself has a decent story and gameplay. Even for today, its graphics remain pretty good. The game can improve your reflexes too, due to many 'scary' or 'out of the dark' moments. The levels are linear in general, but pretty well made.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom 3 has a special place in my heart. It is the game that doesn't belong, the game no one remembers.Doom 3 actually managed to come out several months before Half Life 2, it was similar both in graphics and gameplay, yet Half Life 2 was the winner in the long run and Doom 3 seemed to fall by the wayside, despite its fair share of cult popularity. I think the difference was that Half Life 2 didn't fall victim to the 00s pressure to dust off old IPs and jack them up them with so-so writing and bizarre storylines.Doom 3 succeeds in terms of gameplay, it is a lovable action-horror game that can still give you a jump scare, its story and presentation are shaky sometimes, but that doesn't make it a bad game. I consider it a fine game because its fun to play and doesn't really do anything to offend me despite some of its shortcomings.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember when i Originally bought this (retail back in 2004), i couldn't play it, due to video card.I had to resort to playing at 640 x 480, lowest EVERYTHING, while using EVERY LITTLE Graphical Tweak I could.Game may not have looked good when i played it, but at least i could play it.Now a days, i can play it fine without problems (although i can't run it with sikkmod yet.)Game was fun to play, but wasn't that scary, despite what they said in 2004. FEAR was more scarier.Playing this with the 3rd Party ""Last Man Standing"" coop mod is also fun.I remember making some fun mods when I was bored (Retail Version).Like guns holding WAY more ammo than normal (Shotgun holding 64 for example), guns do more damage (also changed the # of projectiles of the shotgun with each projectile doing more damage and much much lower spread), etc.I remember I was able to change the Machine Gun for example to shoot (active) hand grenades.It was fun to Troll the AI in campaign with that.I also remember changing the pistol to shoot BFG shots (yes, each shot fired 1 bfg shot).Doom 3 was a fun game overall (even if the AI at many times is stupid).I just hope Doom 4 Improves ALOT of things, while at the same time, stick to the old school Doom Gaming (not CoDish).

												I remember when this game came out, I remember wanting this Doom 3 so bad.  I was at first disappointed at certain re-designs, and was sad that, although it was Doom ""3"" it was basically a storyline reboot...  but all of that was forgotten when I was busy scaring myself half way to death.  In college, I had a room mate who was playing the game, when he suddenly jumped up from his keyboard, turned on every light in the room, quit the game, and said ""I'll try again tomorrow.""  He scared himself back to childhood!Doom 3 is one of the greats.  It's critically underrated, it can be a ton of fun.  Enjoy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: May 6, 2016
												Well I've been playing this game since over a month ago. Why has it taken me this long to play through it? Probably two things, distractions from other games and the repetition that Doom 3 has. Doom 3 was made by id Software back in 2004 and it's sort of like a reboot to the original in a way since it doesn't follow the past two games. Just think of it like The Legend of Zelda as you can jump into any game at any time. No need to know any important storyline, not like there is much of a story. Doom 3 is about a scientist in Mars who has gone mad and opens a portal to hell killing nearly everbody thus you're the last marine who must stop the demons invading using the only skill you have. Starting a genicide on anything that the Pope does not approve of. There are some basic characters, cutscenes, even audiologs and emails to read which a lot of the time it's not all that interesting and the only reason to read and listen to said audiologs and emails is to get codes for supply caches.Weapons are good but not great. You have a decent variety of weapons like the shotgun, SMG and rocket launcher. I enjoyed using the Plasma Gun and the BFG was fun the three times I ever got to use it. Enemies are diverse but are hit or miss. I hate the spider ones because who enjoys shooting a bunch of #!$@ing spiders in every game ever? Also some enemies leap at you as soon as you enter a room which is both unfair and gets annoying real quick. I also found it really weird how sometimes I can shoot an Imp with the shotgun in point blank range and it'll die but the same thing happens again and it takes two hits. I could be wrong but there is something very off about it, possible poor hit detection.Level design is okay at first, it's really creepy and some noises of screams and creaks tend to unsettle me but sooner or later it's just a matter of entering a room, demons spawning and you gotta shoot them all. It becomes dull, predictable and annoying and some areas are really cramped so dodging an Imp fireball can be at times impossible which makes it again unfair. I found that after I entered and left Hell I got real sick of it and I consider the rest of the game (2-4 hours) to just be padding it out. It really angered me when all I just wanted to do was move forward but a door says I don't have clearence and I need to find a keycard for it. It's not that the environment changes much either. For 80% of the game you'll be in a dark corridor of some kind of science facility and it leaves me wanting a bit more variation.I think this game has a lot of smaller problems rather than a couple of really big problems. It only shows the longer you play it. You can tell that Doom 3 was influenced by Half Life which is ironic considering Half Life was initially inspired by Doom. I don't think it's a bad game by any means, it's actually an alright game to play through but this wouldn't really be a top recommendation of mine. I'd go with something like Half Life or Bioshock first but that's just my personal tastes. If you're interested then it's worth a go and it goes on sale for very low often. I give it a 6/10.

												This game was brutal when it came out, and still to this day stays brutal.  It's not as polished as newer titles and most games that have come out since, but it's 12~13 years old now!  It's still holding up pretty good.   Also back then, this is all we had and we liked it!   It was a step up from Doom/Doom2... and it was glorious.   If you are going for yester-year memories of this game, buy it on sale.  If you are a newer player, maybe stick with Doom (2016) or get the BFG version of this game.   It'll do you right.

												Doom 3 is an art.  It itself is an art which is difficult to describe.  It is a game that doubles as a throwback to old Doom games, and an attempt at an atmospheric horror game.  It attempted to add a story into the Doom-style mayhem that you might expect, but really it comes down to the gameplay.  You are armed to the teeth, and everything appears from everywhere and tries to kill you.  Even in empty, vacant rooms, I felt outnumbered knowing that at any moment, I could be surprised by Hell's minions.  The gameplay felt very direct, in a Doom-like way.  If it moves, shoot it.  There is no cover-based shooting, no one is here to help you, and gameplay largely revolves around ""get from point A to point B, and don't die on the way.""  This is what the game is, and it delivers a pure FPS experience.  Everything looks amazing, and all enemies are ghoulish at all times.  Even compared to more modern games, I was impressed by the visuals.  All in all, if you liked the classic Doom games, you can't go wrong here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very scary game, as advertised. The graphics are fairly dated at this point in time, & the Acer Aspire had no issue with them. It is too much to play for more than an hour or two at a time, because the ""jump scares"" are exhausting. That is that thing where a monster bursts out of a closet or vent to 'git' you. That is surprising, yes, but also irritating. The atmosphere is quite dark & creepy so I suppose it is successful at creating the feeling that they seem to have been intending to create. I feel like this game is similar to Quake4, but darker, and to Unreal tournament, but MUCH darker/scarier. In terms of graphics it is probably about as good as Wolfenstein 3D. It goes well with a pizza & soda, as i discovered myself just now. For $5 it is somewhat fun & probably worth buying if you are gunning to play something scary for a bit. It is fun sometimes to run old games in ULTIMATE MAXED OUT graphics settings.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You have heard of this game before, everyone has, so why not give it a try?First off the main reasons to choose this over doom 3 bfg edition is that the chain gun and plasma gun fire faster, this version seems a bit more difficult, and there are more mods for this than there are for bfg edition. id did a magnificient job on the world in this game from the machinery that operates itself when there are no humans around, to the creepy audio logs and emails explaining how bad working on mars can really be. All weapons are powerful (not counting the pistol ofcourse) and play a different role in terms of combat, so you can use just the plasma gun but ammo will be scarce until later on in the game. The graphics certainly have aged since 2004 but thats not to say they are bad. The game looks fantastic without any HD mods and thats a minor complaint considering its 10 years old. The game is definitely creepy, while I personally was never scared to go into a dark hallway (mostly because I have such a devasting set of weapons to choose from) there are a lot of jump scares and a lot of random sounds that make the hair stand up on your neck. Not to mention the excellent sounds they used to amp the situation youre in. Did I mention you can tear into demon babies with a chainsaw? That right there should be enough!! (though that is atleast halfway into the game). ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom veterans who play this game for the first time will most likely find themselfs agrivated that it wasn't what they were expecting. ""I payed for a DOOM game, not some slow crappy space shooter!"" they would say. ""What were they THINKING?!""Well, here's my take on what happened:ID team: ""Alright, so we have this brand new IP we want to introduce. We're not sure yet on what it's name is, but It's going to be a dark, atmospheric, and tense first person game in the tight corridors of a space station. There will be these hideous alien creatures and parasites that turn people into zombies, and it's up to you as a staff member on the station to kill through the hordes of aliens and shut down the portal they're comming from while collecting key codes, notes, an alien artifact, and audio logs along the way.""ID execs: ""Alright, the idea seems fine, but no one is going to be interested in an unknown IP. The only way we'll sign off on it is if it's part of a pre-existing series so people will actually buy.ID team: ""Well, I guess Doom takes place on Mars. Alright, I guess we can just remodel the aliens as the Doom enemies and have like, 2 hell levels thrown in and we can call it ""DOOM 3"" ""So in short, yes, Doom 3 is not going to be the game you're expecting. But for what it is, it's a finely tuned Sci-Fi shooter with secrets to be found and the dark unknown to be explored. Once you're put into the right state of mind, it's a very satisfying experience.

												Though my play time says I've only played this for fifteen minutes, rest assured, I played and completed this entire game. It took me many years to work my way through Doom 3, on multiple copies of the game.Doom 3 is a game that wants to be many things. It is good at basically none of them. Many of the things it wants to be contradict each other. It wants to be scary, but it also wants to be macho action. It wants to be Half-Life (and specifically Half-Life), but it also wants to stay Doom. It is neither scary nor action-packed, its story doesn't make any sense, and its villain doesn't actually state any real intended motive. Demons arrive on Mars with the help of Dr. Betruger and want to use our space ships to travel to earth. Think about that for a moment: demons have to use our ships for their invasion, and the game goes out of its way to imply they're rare enough that they aren't readily available. When the first 15 or 20 demons get to earth, what do they think will happen when they get there? Do they think they'll just order another shipment of demons from Mars until, 20 demons at a time, they've conquered the entire planet, unopposed?And why does Betruger want to help the demons reach earth? He just does, because that's all the reason anyone needs, apparently. There are dozens of email logs, a bunch of lore about the origin of the demons and why a portal to hell even exists, but the antagonist is evil just because he's evil, like a Saturday Morning Cartoon villain.The real heart of the problem is the gameplay. Flashlight issues aside, gun play is slow and clumsy. Weapons take forever to reload, and once you start reloading your gun, you can't switch to something else. Often I'd get in to scenarios where I'd empty the clip in one gun, only to have my character start reloading it automatically, locking me in to a long animation. Your only option in that scenario is to watch your character slowly slot each individual shotgun shell in to the barrel, all the while helplessly dancing around incoming enemies. This feels like a horror game mechanic designed to make you panic, but it most frequently happened to me during a part of the game where it's trying to ramp up the action. It creates a very frustrating disconnect, because any logical human would just switch to a different weapon and reload that other gun later. And then there's the ending, with one of the most limp final bosses I've ever encountered and a crummy cliffhanger to set up the expansion pack, Resurrection of Evil. The last thing I wanted out of this game at the end was a stupid ""Gotcha!"" moment, but that's exactly what it has.Doom 3 has a reputation that can't be ignored, but I figured it was at least interesting enough to see through to the end. I was wrong. Curiosity killed the Cacodemon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom 3 is a great shooter, even to this day. It's amazing how well this game actually holds up compared to other recent FPS games. The gameplay is fast and very enjoyable and the guns feel great and powerful. Just avoid the BFG edition and stick with the original instead.

												I'm going to be Really Honest, DOOM 3 wasn't the Best Entry in the Series for me, but its still a Pretty Good Game no matter what I Disliked about it.Pros++Good Gameplay.+Creepy Atmosphere.+Good Level Design.+Some of the Enemy Models are well made, they kinda look as if H.R. Gieger Designed them.+A Sinister Villain (Dr. Betruger).+Has Mod Support.Cons--Level Design whilst Impressive is Very Linear, Narrow Coridors and Almost little to no Alternative Paths, there are some Secret Areas though like in the Original DOOM.-A Majority of the Story Elements were Copied from Half-Life, though to be Fair Technicaly Speaking Half-Life did Copy some Story Elements from the Original DOOM & its Successor Quake.-Some of the Weapons are Good, but some of the others are Pretty Wimpy Compared to their Counterparts in the Original DOOM, Shotgun and Chaingun for Example.-Suspense is Ruined by Cheap Jumpscares and Cutscenes revealing the Monsters.-Handheld Flashlight, this makes sense in a Survival Horror Game like Penumbra, but not a Game like DOOM 3 which is Focused on Action.-The Visuals would have been Impressive for the Time DOOM 3 was Released, but to this Day its Visuals have Aged Poorly, alot of the Models and Map Textures have this Glossy Texturing that makes them look as if they were made from Plastic.No Matter what I didn't like about this Game, I still Enjoyed it.8/10 Inverted Pentagrams.

												TIME TO COMPLETE: 17.5 hoursWhile it might not be as frentic as the originals or this year's title, Doom 3 is a great game. Ranging from animations to lighting, atmosphere and sound this game has aged well were it not for the low-poly models. But hey, back then you had to compensate ! The models look average for the most part (because of the lighting aspect put to good use) and there are only some specific moments where you get to see their true ugly-ness. Textures are blurry even on the highest setting and this is the only thing I feel could be improved on, but otherwise they look good from a distance or at a quick view.The weapons are so-and-so. Some of them feel just perfect (like the chaingun, plasmagun and rocket launcher) while some are either too weak or too quiet (the pistol and machinegun). Either way they are adequate to use and the combat doesn't feel clunky if you can get on with the slow, methodical aproach Doom 3 wants to take.Overall I think Doom 3 is a great game but at the same time an acquired taste. If you loved the originals to death I recommend you try this somewhere else before buying just for reassurance. Otherwise you could go blind but would have to be very open-minded. Make sure to set the sound settings to ""Surround"" instead of ""Stereo"" because this is a very important step in immersion. I found myself using some phone headphones (not even real headphones, lol) while playing and wondered why the sound wasn't as great as it used to be. If there's one thing as to why I would recommend Doom 3 over the BFG Edition is because of mods. Not only you can make it look unimaginably better, but there are also numerous singleplayer maps which can increase your play-time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only get this if you can find it and NOT the dreaded BFG Edition. Why do you ask? Because the BFG Edition is basically a neutered, console friendly version of this. They made that version brighter and less difficult due to adding extra supplies all over the place.The biggest kicker is the BFG version has ZERO MOD COMPATIBILITY. Get the non-BFG for the true Doom 3 experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DOOM 3 is one of the best and worst games I've ever played. it has a mixture of awesome ideas, but alOOOOOOOOOOOt of jumpscares. theres awesome enemies like zombies, classic DOOM enemies, and new ones. but I'm arachnophobic, and theres lots of spiders. from what I know, there are 9 weapons throughout the game including classic ones, and a couple of new ones. gotta say though, the atmosphere on mars is kinda depressing. (I'm used to DOOM 1 & 2 taking place in Hell itself) sometimes, the enemies are hard to kill. fun fact: in an old E3 2002 video, zombies didn't stay dead unless DOOM Guy gibbed them. on the flip side, enemies like zombies and spiders are kinda weak. so use smaller weapons if possible. another thing to note is that there are storage lockers throughout the game, so (if you can and have time to) try to find the code. (found in PDAs of others) just remember 1 thing: this isn't anything like the original DOOMs, so don't try to run-and-gun it. I tried that and didn't last 5 minutes. good luck, and have (well, kinda have) fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												On its own it's a good game, but it feels way too different from the first two games in the series to be called a DOOM game. Rather than having fast-paced action found in the first two games, fighting dozens, and sometimes dozens UPON dozens of enemies in large rooms, DOOM 3 stands out as being more of a horror game.In contrast to DOOM 1 and DOOM 2, DOOM 3 is slower-paced and linear, with generally less space to move around freely and spray bullets like a madman at your enemies. You'll usually fight enemies either one at a time, or in small groups. If you like being spooked and having more than 2 guns at once, then you'll probably have fun with this game.Oh yeah, the story. You're at a base on Mars and then demons.(What the hell happened to the Cacodemons though, seriously: http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/doom/images/d/d4/Cacodemon.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110913092933) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom 3 lives up to its legacy and is a great game for fans of high-octane first person shooters.  The gunplay is great and the story is far superior to what I was expecting.  Many of your favorite enemies and weapons return and I found myself hooked on this game from start to finish.  That was about sixteen hours for me - an impressive length for a FPS and even more impressive that it held my attention.Since Doom is Doom, I won't go into the specifics as we all probably have the general idea already, but I will say that this is a great game that has stood the test of time.  I started playing this over a decade after it came out and it did not disappoint.  The graphics are a bit dated, but that's to be expected, and they are still good enough that I didn't feel that it detracted from the experience at all. I highly recommend this to first-person shooter fans and can easily say that it's a can't-miss game for fans of the old-school shooters like Duke Nukem, Quake, and... well... Doom.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom 3 is the most darkest game i've played, even the bright setting did't do anything. To see in this game you have a flashlight or (torch) in english. and that how my character is a Janitor. Yes my characters name is janitor becouse you'll spend more time with the flashligth than with your weapon drawn. anyway the game really loves ketchup, seriously there's ketchup were ever you go. On the walls, floor computers and even on the roof. you can still find some survivors who give's you their PDA (like a ipad) where they tells you (or whoever is listening) how they ♥♥♥♥ed up. you can also find PDA form dead person's that can contain a Security acces or a password for a locker with ammo, health and stuff of that kind. Doom 3 is fun. Still Doom 3 Is a old game. My oppinion is that old games have more intresting and well made storyline.I would give this a 7/10I recomend it.But be warned that this game contains some jumpscares and a horrifying atmosphere that makes your brain say ""uuhh uhh, I aint goin in ther!""

												Last time I played this in 2004, so it was time for a replay. It was much better than I remembered. It's still an old-school shooter to the core, so no weapon limit / regenerating health / duck-to-cover ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just rip and tear those demons with your shotgun, rocket launcher and plasma gun. A game is much slower-paced than before, so do not expect a run-and-gun shooter like Doom 1 and 2, but a game, that has more emphasis on atmosphere and horror. There is a linear narrative, which unfold before you via cutscenes, pdas and audio logs (like System Shock 2 and Dead Space). I highly recommend to install some mods to upgrade the visuals (I used the Redux mod, which updates the graphics, but leaves everything else vanilla, or you can use Absolute HD, which contain some gameplay changes too).If you know what to expect, it's an awesome game. Fairly long too, so worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Demons from mars.DOOM 3 is classic action-horror game. It was a re-boot to the 'DOOM' series, abandoning open environment for the traditional jump scares.PlotYou play as an unnammed marine who has been recently transfered to the Mars Space Station run by the UAC. As you can expect, things on mars aren't as they seem and soon demons take over the station. It is your job to send these freaks back to where they came from.GameplayMajority of the game is shooting and collecting items. You have a wide range of weapons including pistol, shotgun, machine gun, grenades, chainsaw, pulse rifle. If your feeling crazy, you can even use your fists. Levels are seperated via areas on the station, with each area reached by elevator or other transport. You have both health and armor which you can replenish via pick up items. Ammo can be found in the area or dropped from foes. You face a variety of foes such as zombies, security, skulls, imps, hell knight and other foes which take inspiration from previous entries. There are also boss battles which occur in later levels.AudioMusic is excellent at instilling the dark atmosphere. There isn't much background music during gameplay, which makes you focus on the various sounds such and creaks and footsteps nearby, keeping players feeling edgy and uncomfortable.ConclusionIf you are looking for a good action horror game, Doom 3 will not dissapoint.

												It may be the most slow paced Doom, but damn if it isn't cool and innovative.It has cool touch screen panels you interact with your mouse, and a bottomless pit of (some clever) jumpscares.Some weapons have their ammo count on the actual gun, instead of a HUD element, neat.Some characters look a bit wonky, notably around the head area. However, the environments are well detailed, even if it's much of the same. Also, the shadows are so heavy, I feel like theres a 50 pound weight on my head whenever I'm under a shadow. It's like those damn F.E.A.R./Condemned: Criminal Origins shadows, but even heavier.There's a bunch of audio logs and PDAs you can shuffle throughout the game for some optional dialogue/text and whatnot, as well as some codes for unlocking lockers/rooms for equipment and items.Combat is pretty fun, shoot a zombie up close in the face with a shotgun, they hit the floor harder than a slab of meat made out of brick. A chainsaw with unlimited fuel to wreak havoc, up close and personal like. Rocket Launcher that make demons go boom, and an overly expensive experimental energy weapon, the BFG 9000 that wrecks rooms clean.It's an immersive horror FPS with demons n'♥♥♥♥♥♥coming out the walls. Play it on max graphics, and on hard difficulty, with death metal playing in the background in complete darkness for maximum effect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game, I know a lot of people in the Doom community hates it and I'm not a Doom fanboy, I don't automatically like everything with the Doom name, such as the god awful movie, but Doom 3 is in fact a good game, it didn't have the impact the original had, let's be honest, no future Doom game or any first-person shooter game in general is going to have the impact the original Doom had. The most id Software can do is make an enjoyable Doom game and they succeeded here. I love the horror genre and I love how id Software worked hard to make the game scary. I say give the game a chance, it's still a lot of fun, although online multiplayer is pretty much deader than a graveyard so you won't see many people playing online unfortunately. But the single player mode is a lot of fun. I do recommend you play this. For only $5, it's a good deal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I beat this game a few years ago and I am just now reviewing it, Its not like the other two DOOM games before it, ID software obviously wanted to try a more survival horror feel with this one, and I think they really captured it. Gone is the fast paced movement and destroying rooms full of demons with a shotgun and more of a slow subtle approach with jump scares and blacked out areas where you will be ambushed. There is a flashlight mechanic that you either love or hate, but I liked it from a survival horror standpoint. The game does lack the secret rooms we were all used to, id say there still is some secret rooms here and there and you have storage lockers where you need a code for goodies. but you still have hidden health packs and ammo and even data pads (which add a bit of story of the now deceased members) I honestly loved some of the data pads, some were very unnerving. Overall the game can be quite linear, there's no real way around certain areas and there can be a little back tracking to open certain doors but overall I don't think you will get lost too bad. The game is still scary and holds up pretty well today, just don't go in thinking it will be like previous DOOM entries and be prepared for a slow dark decent into Hell...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's also the game that came out around the same time as Half-Life 2, as well as deviating from the run and gun playstyle from the first two, instead opting for a more horror survival gameplay and making lighting a central theme around it as well, has it aged well?I'd say yes. I think the initial disappointment from a lot of fans came as a result of this game not being the same as the first two, and honestly, in my opinion, I don't think that's a bad thing at all. It's a slower paced game than its predecessors that's for sure, fleshing out its story and narrative through ingame cutscenes and chracter's PDA's, similar to what modern games nowadays are doing... think like BioShock. A lot of people also had complaints with the flashlight system, which is (imo) what lends to the tension you feel throughout the whole game. If you have issues with that however, there's mods, as well the BFG edition which remedies this (which also brightens up some textures from my understanding), but in my opinion that takes away from the atmosphere they were going for in this game. They consciously made the design choice of making you choose between having your gun out, or your flashlight out to scout the darkness, the light giving you a sense of comfort while also leaving you completely defenseless while doing so. Granted, there are some moments when certain enemies will cheaply spawn behind you, or in complete darkness. The game is also a lot longer than I remember it being, its single player campaign clocking in at around 10-15 hours, depending on how you approach things, although to be fair, I think the game starts off kind of slow, easing the player into the narrative before all hell breaks loose. The latter half of the game being very action packed moreso than the beginning.  I think this game was ahead of its time, and I feel it's not as fondly remembered as HL2, but I still think it's a great experience, and one of the last Doom games to be developed by the original id team, before the license was shipped over to Bethesda, definitely an end of an era. Closing out, I have to say I played through it with a graphics mod, to bring the graphics up to date a bit, there's several of them out there but the one I installed was Doom 3 Redux, you can find it among others over on the moddb site.I highly recommend to fans of survival horrors, and first person shooters. One of the better titles that came out during that era. Would definitely suggest playing it with an HD texture pack as well, the game holds up suprisingly well when using them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom and its sequel were THE BEST GAMES EVER in terms of good gunplay, fluid movement, twitch reaction, and replayability factor. This is NOT a Doom game. Ridiculously dark, in an attempt to create a tense and scary atmosphere. If you dont fancy modding the game this means hours of walking into walls essentially feeling your way round the perimiters of small rooms full of random clutter that cannot simply be walked over, but has to be kicked, tripped over and caught on.Depleting stamina bar means no unlimited running, seems a bit strange that someone would suddenly become too tired to jog when all manner of hellspawn are chasing after him. Shotgun is a bad joke, easily possible to completely miss every pellet at a range of less than 2 meters. View flinch when hit is probably the worst i have ever seen in any game ever. This is not helped by the random swarms of small ankle biting monsters in totally dark corridors full of crap to trip over. These last few issues combined make this a painfully bad experience. Some people seem to think that getting triple-slapped when you cant even see what youre supposed to be shooting at is an intended game mechanic that adds to the atmosphere. Are you for real?Anyway il leave it down to you whether you think this is worth the purchase on nostalgia factor alone, but this review is coming from a lifelong doom fan who bought this game for less than £2, and i still feel as though i wasted my money.

												Doom 3 is a astounding game that combines the First Person Shooter style-gameplay of previous Doom games with revolutionary graphics that still stand up to modern titles. I prefer the original to the BFG Edition as Doom 3 was one of the first games I got on Steam and holds a special place in my heart.The scares still get me everytime, even though I've played through the game in it's entirety several times.Nothing compares to the satisfaction of pumping an Imp coming at you down a dimly-lit corridor with led from your trusty shotgun, still being wary of what's around every dark corner.In addition, the lighting was one of the most hyped up things about this game, and boy does it deserve it. The lighting in this game is great even by modern standards, the dynamic lighting is realistic and I honestly enjoy taking in the scenery of the Mars Base.The sound effects are quite nice, and the monsters genuinely sound intimidating, I jump everytime I hear something behind me in a blood-showered hallway with flickering lights, because I know that means it's back to Demon Killing.I'd recommend this game to any fan of previous Doom games, fans of Horror, fans of FPS games, or a combination of all those things.

												This game is absolutely fantastic. With Doom being the game that all modern day FPSs owe their lives to, Doom 3 takes the story even deeper than the original 2, and to an even more terrifying level with a new 3D world to explore. It truly is one of the pioneers of the horror genre, with a delicious amount of gore, and tons of scares galore. (Ha I rhymed) It's totally worth the price, and is sure to make you look over your shoulder while playing. I totally recommend it! Hope you guys enjoy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, it is actually possible to run Doom 3 natively on Linux. (Google is your friend in this regard.) If you do so, the Linux installation will be independent of Steam, although it will be dependent on the CD key which is also provided by Steam. (Which is why my time played appears much lower than it actually is.) So that's a thing.Doom 3 is an excellent FPS. It is a game where most weapons feel powerful and a little bit of tactical movement will go a long way. Here's what I mean by tactical movement: I see an imp, dodge its fireball, and immediately sprint up to it and give it a shotgun blast before it can retaliate. When a Revenant fires at me, I move backwards along a tight circular path to throw off the rocket's homing capability. Generally, dodge and counterattack will be a pretty common habit within this game.While the weapons are pretty standard, they do their job quite nicely. A rocket will send a ragdoll flying, the chaingun makes a thunderous hail of death, the plasma gun lays down a huge volume of fire (and can even block projectiles when used by a sufficiently skilled player), the chainsaw is so effective that it kills the atmosphere, and the BFG literally destroys everything in sight.Except for lousy model quality, I think that this game is very nice looking and has aged rather well. This is one of its cardinal sins: if a game has great graphics but not a memorable story, it will be forever branded as a tech demo because you can't please everyone with just your gameplay. As for story, the story is basic and somewhat cliche, but I do love the character of Dr. Betruger. But if you're a story freak and possibly a cynic in that regard, then you will have a bad time.And this game is long to the point of being a fault. It feels like it should be over at the end of the hell level, but it just keeps going. (Granted there are some fun encounters after that point.)By the way, don't worry about the flashlight. People complain about how you have to choose between holding a gun or a flashlight, but the only enemies you will fight when you need the light are zombies, which won't be much of a problem, and imps, which obligingly light themselves up for your convenience.Ultimitately, I can't tell you whether or not you will enjoy Doom 3, but I personally think that it is a high quality shooter and that at the very least you should pick it up on sale if you have any interest at all.

Sikkmod improved the graphics and makes all of your weapons sound powerful. Sikkmod also lets you customize most things in the singleplayer. You can do all kinds of things with Sikkmod, like use infrared goggles, customize the damadge demons do, make demons spawn out of nowhere at certain times (which makes the game even scarier), change the health system, be able to have an arnour mounted flashlight (the light radius is VERY small, it keeps the horror atmosphere there) EMZ improves Doom 3's multiplayer.

												Played a lot this game when it came out. Don't let the great gunplay of this game fool you: no matter how badass those weapons are, monsters and atmosphere is still gonna scare you a lot. If you miss the old school shooting or like horror and forgive action (just like Resident Evil 4) get this. If you like both, then you gonna have a good time.Plus you get a lot of mod support.The game may be repetitive in the long term,  but you can always finish a level or two and stopping before coming back. I suggest you to try to finish any level without quicksaving to wreck your nerves :PIf you think a good FPS needs to have samey infantry enemies (guys with gun wich you kill with guns), dogs, and homogeneized gunplay where the SMGs, Assault Rifles, Carbines, and LMGs have magically the same balistic precision, don't get this game. But please point a real gun at your face and pull the trigger. Games as good as this are very few thanks to that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite games of all time! However, this game is not without it's caveats, the main one being the lack of basic equipment on a futuristic colony on Mars.You mean to tell me that over a hundred years into the future, combat marines will be left running around in the dark without night vision goggles or even a $5 headlamp? All you have is an old Mag light that you have to switch back and forth from your weapons meaning you can not protect yourself with a gun and defend yourself at the same time. This makes no sense, why doesn't the main protagonist just duct tape the flashlight to his rifle, do they not have duct tape in the 22nd century? This problem was so bad I hear someone online even made a patch specifically to fix this problem where it makes the flashlight work even when you are holding a weapon. Despite it's problems, it's still a great game and a must play for any FPS fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You'll find out very fast that this doesn't play like a regular Doom game but it is one of my all time favorite games and I recommend you pick it up. You still have somewhat of that mindless shooter feel along with a very involving story. Being a game from 2004 the graphics are extremely good, and then there is the BFG edition release in 2012 that remastered this game. How I see Doom 3 compared to other people? You get all your original guns from Doom back in 1993, and all of the classic monsters making this story driven game so much fun. I had legit cried when I first beat it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												  Almost equal part survival horror game and shooter, Doom 3 is a departure from the original classics. Blaring MIDI metal and full speed circle strafing gives way to silence and methodically checking every corner for monsters. The story is surprisingly lengthy and involved, taking inspiration from the Alien films with a demonic Starship Troopers B-movie vibe. It was somewhat divisive when it originally released; the slower pace and heavy reliance on light management wasn't helped by the concurrent rise of the vocal, entitled, forum-dwelling “gamer” that was adverse to change of any kind. This backlash quickly led to a popular “flashlight mod” for the game; a cheat that bypassed the need to switch from your weapon to your light source and completely changed the nature of play. Once this “fix” was in circulation and accepted as a superior way to play the game, subsequent releases (the BFG Edition) used it as a new standard with no option to experience the game as originally intended. A decade later, it's pretty clear those people were wrong. The BFG Edition of Doom 3 is a fairly forgettable corridor shooter. This true version of Doom 3 is still fantastic and is much more influential than anyone seems to give it credit for.  Lighting is a central mechanic to Doom 3. While some of the character models and textures are starting to show their age, the lighting effects and art direction are still incredibly impressive. You use the “F” key to switch to your flashlight frequently; much of the game is filled with moody shadows and often complete pitch blackness. It's not uncommon to have to make a choice to either aim for a demon's glowing red eyes or lure it toward a more helpful light source, hoping you don't back into a trap in the process. It's ballsy how willing Doom 3 is to engulf the player in darkness, knowing their choice is to either be able to see or defend themselves. You can't do both. Walking through hostile environments armed with only a flashlight is it's own genre now; Outlast, Slender Man, Alien: Isolation... that disempowerment was a cornerstone of Doom 3.  Most of the weapons and enemies from the previous games return: the possessed soldiers, the standard Imps, floating Cacodemons, dead-raising Revenants, towering Hellknights, and the big bad Cyberdemon. A few new ones make their appearances, notably the weak but swarming spiders and creepy winged baby things. Then there are standard zombies, which aren't much of a threat on their own but have a habit of trapping you in corners if you're not careful. They're also great chainsaw fodder. Weapons include the all-around handy shotgun, the hammering chaingun, plasma gun, a new standard if generic assault rifle, and the legendary BFG. Ammo conservation and choosing the right tool for the right situation seems more vital than ever, as weapons have a pretty clear rock-paper-scissors relationship to most monsters. And the monsters can be right aggressive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, relentlessly chasing you down and teleporting toward or behind you. Some attacks and scripted “jump scares” seem almost impossible to avoid damage from, causing health and ammo rationing to ratchet up to true survival horror levels. Also new (though introduced late in the game) is the Soul Cube, an alien artifact that charges up by killing five enemies, which can then be thrown for massive damage and health regeneration. It's an odd weapon, but it does add an additional layer of strategy as you prioritize low ranking demons for the charge to obliterate the tougher foes.  A gripping narrative and the Doom name doesn't exactly go hand-in-hand, but a surprising amount of care went into building the game's lore and the pacing is actually spot on. You play The Marine, a voiceless guy who shows up on a Mars base in the future. Almost immediately♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan and the base's personnel gets a bad case of the Satans and demons start coming through portals. There's a mad scientist intent on helping the demons (or something), and the demons want to ultimately conquer Earth because they're actually an ancient race that humans have descended from. It's real campy schlock, but it's very self aware and dips into outright comedy at times, then presents truly dark and disturbing imagery in the next beat. I'd describe the tone as The Evil Dead meets Aliens.  You interact with the environments in a number of ways to solve puzzles; many of the computers can be cursored over in order to raise bridges, move machinery, or access camera or communication feeds. It's quite an impressive level of detail, mechanics that predated modern games like SOMA, Dead Space, and Alien: Isolation (again...). In addition to the standard finding of keycards and badges to raise your security clearance and unlock doors, Doom 3 features another form of storytelling collectible that has become prolific enough to become a cliché: audio logs and e-mails. Now, this certainly isn't the first video game to have the player sift through characters' personal files, but the game came out well before the method had overstayed it's welcome and is still some of the best implementation I've come across. Some of the exchanges between staff are genuinely funny, and the Martian Buddy spam is a forgotten classic. Even the video discs have a distinct style and personality, and even if some of this fluff can be criticized for slowing the game down, it's optional and I enjoyed diving into every last one. It can't be understated how great (and often tense) it is to be able to listen to audio logs as you explore and fight; something other games still screw up to this day.  Doom 3 holds up better than just about any other game of it's vintage I can think of. It remains super tense and oppressive, and I found myself leaning toward the screen as I played with baited breath. With a good pair of headphones and a darkened room it's just as effective (if not more so) than most modern horror games. When the bullets and fireballs start flying it's still definitely classic Doom, but the new emphasis on narrative and lore-building allow the masterfully crafted, cramped hellish battlefields to legitimately scare the crap out of you. It plays silky smooth while still feeling brutal and visceral. Doom 3 may be a different breed of Doom, but now when it kicks♥♥♥♥♥you might just♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself in the process.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite its somewhat underwhelming reputation I couldn't love this game more.Its true the game has more than its fair share of dark spots, but, well... I call myself a cat I guess darkness is kinda my thing. :P  I actually really like the infamous flashlight mechanic, it adds tension and fear to environments that wouldn't be particularly scary -- and in the BFG edition where that mechanic is removed, they aren't.The combat is fun and fast-paced, if a bit repetitive, but the variety with certain monsters like Arch-Viles takes some of the repetitiveness out of it once you get deep into the campaign.  The boss fights are really fun with unique mechanics except, somewhat, for the last one -- and they strike a good balance when it comes to difficulty: you'll finish them without much health left but you probably won't die so much it gets frustrating.  Hard mode is very fun as it's not about hiding or taking cover -- the way the monsters spawn you have to be pretty ferocious in order to survive.Map design is actually not too linear, which is a good thing to see in a game even as old as 2004... levels are maze-like without being confusing, and there's a decent variation in texture and structure schemes especially toward the end of the game -- although that part could still be improved somewhat.  Coming to this as I did about 8 years after it was released this type of level design was like a breath of fresh air.Graphics are still beautiful even 12 years later, the monsters and especially boss designs are grotesque and disturbing, they really feel like they could be demons out of some hell.There are a few minor quibbles I have -- just a few straighforward ones, and one or two weird ones...In a 27-level campaign, a lot of the monsters only appear for three or four levels or stop appearing altogether just after the mid-point.  This seems to especially happen to the most interesting designs like a literal baby insect, the (somewhat) classic lost soul, and the... Mancubus... thing...  Even the ubiquitous Pinky Demon from the original games kinda disappears after the fifteenth map or so.  There are plenty of other monsters that appear later on but it would have been nice to see some demons from the earlier maps stick around especially when enemy variety is one of the game's strong points.The weapons tend to be kinda same-ish although there's still enough variety to go around and enough situations where you do want to switch from one to the other.  You do have a bloody chainsaw if you get bored and it works well on even some of the high-level monsters like Arch-Viles, but the weapons are still a weak point.  I find myself mostly using the shotgun even when another weapon would work just as well -- it seems even limiting the amount of shotgun ammo you can find or carry (there doesn't seem to be any maximum, or if there is it's so high I've never reached it) would have gone a long way towards resolving this.  Its ammo does get more scarce towards the end of the game but so does the ammo for everything else, leaving you in the same situation.Finally -- and this is the weird one -- some of the monster sounds are distorted samples taken from tiger calls.  I spend a decent amount of time around tigers and these calls are, quite clearly, ""chuffs"" (a kind of purr) and mating calls.  I guess Pinky's a succubus now? :P  It can get pretty hard to take a hellish monster seriously when it's literally purring at you.Interestingly enough, the gameplay isn't the only place you can find big cat sounds in this game...All in all this is a great game, with a lot of custom content as well that I haven't gone into here just 'cuz I've already been talking long enough.  An underrated classic, I highly recommend giving it a look if all you've heard is its reputation for dark spaces and a weird flashlight.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You battle your way through dark corridors, blood soaked rooms and Martian terrain killing zombies, fire imps and all sorts of strange creatures. I suppose you can say Doom 3 is not an 'original' game in its ideas, but that won’t bother you once you get totally absorbed into it's environment. Like the original Doom, it has the end of level 'bosses' and you get all the good weapons right until the end when you have to battle the infamous Cyberdemon.The look of the game is amazing, with fantastic light and shadows (rather more of the latter than former) and innovative use of interactive computer screens. The sound is close to perfect.The atmosphere of the game is unparalleled, keeping you permanently alert. The few scenarios where the game uses psychological horror are very effective.On the other hand, the game sometimes gets repetitive. Although most of the game manages to hold your interest, there seems to be a lot of ""filler"" missions reminiscent of older id titles: get key to open door / find an access code / etc. This is particularly the case in the middle of the game when, after an impressive beginning, you begin to feel that the game ought to advance the plot a bit or give you something else to do rather than shooting imps and wandering some uninspired corridors. It does eventually liven up a bit, but the game would be much improved by some more variety.Some of the combat is also unfair, with monsters teleporting directly behind you. This can get annoying, but doesn't harm the horror aspect of the game at all as it keeps you permanently on edge.Overall, a rather unique game which is well worth playing.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I admit that I'm one of the many who gave this game all kinds of hate eversince I played it for the first time. I can't say it's completely my fault since the game does leave a terrible first impression with it's extremely slow pace and stupid scripted events. It's not until about 3 or 4 hours into the game that this game becomes Doom. I bought this game cheap on sale and decided to give it another go since playing it for the first time on the original XBOX. The game makes you think that all you're going to get is a little action in between reading emails, listening to logs, waiting through cutscenes. Well I'm glad to say that you won't. Collect all the PDAs you can find and just scan the emails to see if you can get codes to the weapon lockers so you can stay well stocked on ammo. Other than that you can pretty much ignore everything else. By the time you reach the end of this game you will know that you've played Doom. No, you don't flip a switch or collect a key to open up multiple closets full of enemies, but enemies do spawn all around you and will cut you down quickly if you don't dispatch them quick enough and strategize your reloads well. If you're a fan of Doom, you should play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Imps.You turn the corner and there is a imp.They are never that big of a deal, yet the game loves to spam one or three every room.Too many imps.While not as good as the 2016 DOOM, D3 is a rather nice game, filled with demons and very tedious Imps.When I first heard of this game being too dark I thought it was a joke. Turns out about a chunk of all the rooms are almost pitch black, leading to some decent ambushes. The game is very linear, with a few off side areas for ammo or health. Great game if you want to try out the DOOM games without being overwhelmed by it's fast combat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom 3 was a hit when it came out and is an absolutely necessary game to play if you are a fan of the original doom series.  There are pros and cons, however, to this game.  It seems that id tried harder to create a horror game than an action game.  The original Doom games were screens filled with enemies to take out with over the top action.  Here the action is still over the top, but you fight against a maximum of 5 creates at a time at the most, and not screens full of enemies.  This changes the pace of the game and lowers the bar for the action a bit.  Also, by trying to make it scary, the levels are very dark.  This is too bad because the graphics are beautiful, but hard to see when the lighting is so low.  I would say though that the graphics compared to Source didn't age as well when compared to today's graphic abilities.However, this is still Doom.  This is still a game of kill or be killed and you are still a bad♥♥♥♥♥with a gun.  All of the old guns come back from the previous games and they feel great.  The levels are corridor levels, and not open areas, but that helps with making this more of a horror game.  The sounds are good and the music is pretty much the same as quake with a heavy metal focus.Do I like this game better than I loved the original Doom, no.  But I can't not recommend this game, as the graphics and its brand name set a standard that all other games of the future look to copy or surpass.  id did not make the impact with Doom 3 as they did with the original Doom, but this is still worth your time playing.

												DOOM 3 is a FPS that isn't quite the same as its predecessors, but it's good in its on unique way. DOOM 3 employs more darker levels, horror and fear tactics (enemies popping out from hidden walls or teleporting around you) which works very well. The graphics and attention to detail all look great and the level designs are a lot tighter and have the player traversing through a lot of hallways and corridors. The campaign is ~8-10 hours long so it's a lot longer than most campaigns. During the middle it becomes a little repetitive as you constantly have to find PDAs or some item before you can open a door but then near the end the game really kicks into another gear and ends on a high note. DOOM 3 is a solid FPS shooter that also may have the player jump out of the seat once or twice!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom 3 honestly really disappointed me. It’s pretty technically sound; the graphics hold up well, the lighting is great, and the sound design while nothing really  special gets the job done. Doom 3 fails in the fact that is sticks to one formula that gets stale by around half way through the game. The game pushes itself as horror; nothing wrong with that of course. However Doom 3 tries the same tactics throughout the whole game. It pushes the same scares, the same enemies (which once you figure out there patterns there total pushovers), and the same dark industrial environment that looks exactly the same as the rest of the game. All these things stop being scary and start being annoying. This wouldn’t be so much of a problem if the staleness was only related to the scares. Unfortunately it affects the combat as well. Due to the cramped environments you will only ever be fighting a few enemies at time very rarely having the environments open up that much. This leads the game to never really get that much harder while also making every combat encounter feel samey. The game is entirely to long as well, even if the other reasons weren’t a problem it feels like it skips over its natural concluding point by at least a few hours. Overall Doom 3 is a game that overstays its welcome, it’s unwillingness to mix things up leads to a repetitive and boring experience ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												Conclusion: Get the BFG EditionThis game was probably epic when it came out in 2004. But for me who just tried it out I'm not very happy about it. I just tried out Doom 1 and Doom 2 (yes I am a bit late to the party), but those games were epic, fun and challenging in a good way.Doom 3 just changes too much from the original formula - and not for the better (which is confirmed by the fact that the new Doom (doom reboot?) basically went back to the old formula and turned it up to 11. Gone are the open ""mini-arenas"" where you fight hordes of enemies; difficult at times, but fair in the sense that you outrun the enemies and can take cover. Doom 3, on the other hand, just throws you into a narrow corridor, spawning enemies infront and behind you with no possibility for mobility and calls that fair?!?. And so far, the game has not been difficult for any other reason than that you can not see your targets. That is the main killer for me with this game. So many times I've died not because the enemy would be particulary difficult to kill in itself, but when you get 0 vision, you can't aim. And that's where the BFG Edition comes in: It has a modern system with tac-lights strapped onto your gun (or yourself, whichever) and makes the game playable.So yeah, stay away from the vanilla version and get the proper game. I'm not gonna write a more in-depth review here, since I'm moving over to the BFG edition and will review that instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most of my playtime with Doom 3 has been with ye ol' CD ROM version. So my Steam stats aren't a good reflection.PROS:+ Action, and plenty of it.+ Atmosphere. Excellent use of lighting, sounds, and jump scares.+ Very fluid controls.+ Modest hardware requirements. Anything built after 2006 should be able to run Doom 3.+ Killer mods. Modding community continues to add cool stuff to Doom 3.+ Solid multiplayer.+ A steal at only $10, and often on sale for even less.CONS:- 6th generation (PS2/original Xbox) graphics. Graphics snobs are probably going to gripe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DOOM 3 wowed me when I was a child and when it first came out. I remember having to see this at my friends house and was completely spooked by the visuals and how it can make the game scary. While modern game mechanics and technology kinda did make the game look dated now, I still think this is a great game and an amazing visual piece to play. The horror in the game works, most of the guns felt awesome to use and the enemies out right terrifying and hard to take down. Though the story, which they tried to add a story to the game, doesn't feel amazing and kinda silly, I still recommend this game. HOWEVER, I do not recommend Resurrection of Evil's Campaign because I felt the campaign was a bloody mess and was out right terrible. Me and my friend played the whole game in coop with a mod for both the base and the expansion and we both agree that Resurrection of Evil was a crappy expansion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game, believe it or not, is a decade old.  Even with that considered, it still looks pretty decent to this day.  I highly recommend this game over the new BFG version for a number of reasons both subjective and objective.The objective reason is obvious, that being that sikk mod (may be wrong spelling), along with the wolfsomething texture pack make it look even better than the BFG edition.   The rest is subjective.  I have heard and seen play throughs of the new lost mission in the BFG edition.  Not only does it make no sense along the lines of Aliens Colonial Marines with Michael Bean still being alive, but the levels are not very compelling.Overall if you can get the origional with the classic flashlight with no gun I suggest playing this game on hard, without the ducktape mod.  The game was designed with this as a game mechanic even though, from what I have heard it was a technical compromise.  One interesting thing about the new BFG version with the suit flashlight is that there are no shadows.  Where as with the hand held flashlight there are.  Carmack evidently wanted flashlight design to go in one direction while the industry took another.  This is why for those of you who played quake 4, using the same engine, you can see your allied NPcs flashlights, but in left 4 dead you cannot.  Back to the game and less about tech history. This game has good graphics even without mods.  It was one of those games that when it came out was hands down the best looking thing out on the market.  If your keen about moding, I mentioned a really good texture pack above.  The game has a nice variety of enemies and guns.  This is a game back in the days where you did not need 10 smgs, 10 asault rifles, and so on.  You get your standard shotgun, machine gun, plasma gun, and BFG!!!  Despite people calling most enemies idiots you will die a few times on hard so save often.  There is some strategy such as with the tentecal commando.  Knowing to let him run up to you and duck, shoot, stand, shoot in the face is a hard but excellent tactic. (timing wise you can mess up and die real fast)  Also start the game on hard.  Any horror game (im not saying this is survival horror, but it applies to that as well) should in my humble opinion be played on the hardest difficulty available, in the dark, and with a headset.  As scary as the artwork or demonic base can get, its not very scary if your enemies are a joke.  Since there is no regenerating health you will find yourself with 32 hp on many occasions, one hit away from death from a hard ememy.  Thats tension baby!Also while this is entirely up to you, I must say playing with the basic flashlight design really makes or breaks the game for me.  Having played it with both, I cannot stress how there is worse lighting and less tension.  Yes I know a flashlight is one of the basic attachments to any gun and it makes no sense, but we are playing a game about demons from hell.  The flashlight leaves you vulnerable and makes you slowly explore rooms until hell breaks loose.  Also slowing down allows you to hear enemies hiding.  Ive often used the tactic of fill the room with grenades and then enter (Careful those things love to blow you up).  The game does have monster closets, and while cheap, they do scare you and I honestly hated them in 2004, but really came to like them when I replayed recently.  In the end its your choice about the flashlight, just know it will change the game experience.Multiplayer is dead so your getting this for the singleplayer.  Overall its a nice scary walk through time.  Hope this was helpful, if not let me know why so I can improve.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you've ever played Doom, you know it's a fast-paced run and gun shooter. Doom 3 still is, but it is distinctly slower, putting more emphasis on atmosphere instead. The lighting engine was very advanced for the time and it really helps to set the mood when you see huge, menacing shadows fly by the walls cast by demons running through low angle lighting. That said, the whole game is dark. You get a flashlight, but you have to choose between equipping it or wielding a weapon. That fact has garnered a lot of flak for the game, but I didn't mind it. Forcing you to hold your flashlight at the cost of disarming yourself made simply walking down a corridor feel intense. The majority of the game takes place in a research facility on Mars, which grants a sense of isolation. You know that you and the few remaining personnel are on your own. Inside this facility, though are a bunch of tight corridors, and that's about it. Again, some people hate that, but to me claustrophobia is another plus factor to the atmosphere. The game is meant to be intense, even when nothing is going on, and the feeling of being trapped does just that.With the exception of reloading, the gunplay feels classic. You have to put a bunch of rounds into the enemies to kill them, and some of the larger enemies will require multiple reloads with smaller weapons. Circle strafing is a must in larger areas, but you'll have to do a lot of popping in and out of cover or tactically charge or retreat in most cases. It has the same sort of feel as Doom, just a bit modernized (for 2004) and stylized.The game has a few flaws, though, but they can mostly just be ignored. The AI is a little lackluster at times. There are small closet-sized rooms which serve simply to open silently behind you and release an enemy. The darkness might strain your eyes a bit, so playing for a couple hours might be a bit uncomfortable. To some, the gameplay might get repetitive. But for me, the strengths far outweighed these few weaknesses. This is definitely a recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're searching for a game that makes you move-fast-and-shoot, and a game that give soy a few scares (jumpscares, not tension at all), this is yours. Also it's a LOOOOOONNNNGGG game, so it worths the price (5€ for me in a Steam offer).Also, the plot is not great, but it's enough.Anyway, it's a good game.Oh! I almost forgot: You have tons of mods to download for that game on Moddb.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*Gnome Seal of Approval*Classic 1st person shooter. Unlike the old Doom games, this one relies on horror and a dark atmosphere. And it sure as hell scares me. The mood in this game always keeps you on your toes and looking over your shoulder. An annoying (but effective) feature is that you can't have the flashlight and your guns out at the same time. And you need the light all the time since this game relies on darkness to keep you scared.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personal Game of the Decade - 2000sI avoided this game for a long time as I loved Doom 1 and 2, and having to worry when two Imps spawn in a dark room in Doom 3 as compared to me easily mowing down literally a hundred of them in Doom 2's Xbox/BFG Edition exclusive level pack finale sounded pretty uninteresting. Thing is I rented Doom 3 BFG edition and played through it and... despite the problems BFG edition had, I have to call this game a masterpiece. An absolute classic, holds up extremely well today, I recommend it fully. Just don't get BFG edition.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom 3 was in its time a technical marvel, and it will forever be one of the last ""game-changing"" technical achievements. I remember when this was released and I was in college. All of my friends and I were sharing benchmark results, upgrading computer systems just to get better performance. I was however too cheap with my purple MX440 but I was happy nonetheless. We competed to progress through the game and it was a fantastic time!From this point, computer game graphics have never really exceeded to amaze, and as the last major release I dedicated time to as a pre-graduate. The game brings together a fantastic new engine compiled by none other than John Carmack. The game demonstrates no unique story, no real plot.It's a jump scare action shooter, it feels fantastic to shoot, and the game is quite fun and looks great still today. It shows a unique side than games today seem to show: satanic themes. As you progress through the game, you'll get more powerful weapons to face more powerful enemies which are reminiscent of Doom II's demons including the Imps, Pinkies, Archevilles, Mancubus and the rest of the gang. The game itself is traditional id software and there are still many of who love id software and you won't see me complain. Id were never great at story telling - it was all about fun and innovation which they've exceeded expectations due to Carmack's efforts.The graphics were compared to the original Far Cry in its time and I could never understand how the two compared. Sure Far cry was innovative in its time, it was one of the first open world attempts and it was generally not recognised as a good game until years later in which I still don't find attractive...Play this game and love it, but you won't need to play it more than once unless you're a fan such as myself. Great fun, good scares that get you jumping and great feeling shooting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good sci-fi horror game. Has a survival horror pace, not run and gun like classic Doom. It is a physically dark game, so if that's not your thing you might not love it. The graphics hold up reasonably well, though not as impressively as Half-life 2's. Turn up the volume and turn out the lights for the best experience. This original version is artistically superior to the BFG edition. Great atmosphere, sound, and story, I think they did a great job at realizing the Doom world! Great game for anyone who enjoys horror or science fiction.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dark, very very dark. Unless you have the gamma jacked up all the way be prepared to be walking with your flashlight for 95% of the game, which actually ends up being a good thing because it will add to the horror aspect of the game very well. Most of the monsters we all remember from the classic doom games are back, some have some visual changes but the main design is still there. Definitely a huge jump from Doom2 but the game is still very good/scary.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game, believe it or not, is a decade old.  Even with that considered, it still looks pretty decent to this day.  I highly recommend this game over the new BFG version for a number of reasons both subjective and objective.The objective reason is obvious, that being that sikk mod (may be wrong spelling), along with the wolfsomething texture pack make it look even better than the BFG edition.   The rest is subjective.  I have heard and seen play throughs of the new lost mission in the BFG edition.  Not only does it make no sense along the lines of Aliens Colonial Marines with Michael Bean still being alive, but the levels are not very compelling.Overall if you can get the origional with the classic flashlight with no gun I suggest playing this game on hard, without the ducktape mod.  The game was designed with this as a game mechanic even though, from what I have heard it was a technical compromise.  One interesting thing about the new BFG version with the suit flashlight is that there are no shadows.  Where as with the hand held flashlight there are.  Carmack evidently wanted flashlight design to go in one direction while the industry took another.  This is why for those of you who played quake 4, using the same engine, you can see your allied NPcs flashlights, but in left 4 dead you cannot.  Back to the game and less about tech history. This game has good graphics even without mods.  It was one of those games that when it came out was hands down the best looking thing out on the market.  If your keen about moding, I mentioned a really good texture pack above.  The game has a nice variety of enemies and guns.  This is a game back in the days where you did not need 10 smgs, 10 asault rifles, and so on.  You get your standard shotgun, machine gun, plasma gun, and BFG!!!  Despite people calling most enemies idiots you will die a few times on hard so save often.  There is some strategy such as with the tentecal commando.  Knowing to let him run up to you and duck, shoot, stand, shoot in the face is a hard but excellent tactic. (timing wise you can mess up and die real fast)  Also start the game on hard.  Any horror game (im not saying this is survival horror, but it applies to that as well) should in my humble opinion be played on the hardest difficulty available, in the dark, and with a headset.  As scary as the artwork or demonic base can get, its not very scary if your enemies are a joke.  Since there is no regenerating health you will find yourself with 32 hp on many occasions, one hit away from death from a hard ememy.  Thats tension baby!Also while this is entirely up to you, I must say playing with the basic flashlight design really makes or breaks the game for me.  Having played it with both, I cannot stress how there is worse lighting and less tension.  Yes I know a flashlight is one of the basic attachments to any gun and it makes no sense, but we are playing a game about demons from hell.  The flashlight leaves you vulnerable and makes you slowly explore rooms until hell breaks loose.  Also slowing down allows you to hear enemies hiding.  Ive often used the tactic of fill the room with grenades and then enter (Careful those things love to blow you up).  The game does have monster closets, and while cheap, they do scare you and I honestly hated them in 2004, but really came to like them when I replayed recently.  In the end its your choice about the flashlight, just know it will change the game experience.Multiplayer is dead so your getting this for the singleplayer.  Overall its a nice scary walk through time.  Hope this was helpful, if not let me know why so I can improve.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DOOM 3 wowed me when I was a child and when it first came out. I remember having to see this at my friends house and was completely spooked by the visuals and how it can make the game scary. While modern game mechanics and technology kinda did make the game look dated now, I still think this is a great game and an amazing visual piece to play. The horror in the game works, most of the guns felt awesome to use and the enemies out right terrifying and hard to take down. Though the story, which they tried to add a story to the game, doesn't feel amazing and kinda silly, I still recommend this game. HOWEVER, I do not recommend Resurrection of Evil's Campaign because I felt the campaign was a bloody mess and was out right terrible. Me and my friend played the whole game in coop with a mod for both the base and the expansion and we both agree that Resurrection of Evil was a crappy expansion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: March 6, 2013
												DOOM 3 is a serviceable 2004 horror shooter that just happens to be a Doom game, for better and worse. It's not on the level of its forebears, but it's not terrible either. At the very least, download Killatomate's Realistic Weapons mod to make your firepower not garbage. Avoid the BFG Edition - it screws with gameplay balance, and is incompatible with mods, of which there's plenty to make OG look even better than BFG. (I didn't like the BFG ports of classic Doom either: they modify the games too much and run poorly.)So hey, this is still Doom, right? There's too much ammo and health lying around to really qualify Doom 3 as survival horror, so it must be. While I think the game could absolutely have used more open spaces, I don't mind the game mainly taking place in linear corridors because they are very good corridors.Lot of PDAs lying around to collect though, and only like two or three female characters in the entire game, so you know this is a 2004 product. The PDAs at least give the game an air of immersion and worldbuilding. It's a shame the game as linear as it is, since a branching plot point (an actual one) would have been a good gameplay point, not to mention a bit of a callback to the classics' level design.The aforementioned mod makes the guns actually fun to use instead of wet cardboard, to the point where I consider it a requirement since you happen to spend a lot of the game using them on the demons. Some of the guns still become superfluous after a while, since there's more of them here than in the original games. When you have a rocket launcher and grenades and a chaingun and an SMG, you tend to use what you feel like using. Meanwhile, the bigger problem with Doom 3's gameplay is that every other encounter is a cheap 'gotcha' or some sort of monster closet, most of which get predictable after a while. The originals did this too, but not nearly as much nor as egregiously.There's also a number of encounters with multiple little spider enemies crawling out of vents and such where all you do is just stand there and shoot them, which gets a little tedious. System Shock had respawning enemies, which would have been an interesting experiment with the Doom formula here and at the very least less annoying than a dozen spiders crawling one at a time out of a vent shaft.Don't get me wrong, this game builds enough tension that it can get away with jumpscares every so often, and it's not like they're the obnoxious full-screen ""find the hidden object"" type, but Silent Hill this ain't. While I would argue Doom 3 actually pulls off its horror much better than it does its terror, that doesn't excuse the entirely scripted monster closets getting old after a while. The lack of checkpoints means that if you're caught off-guard by one, you potentially get to replay the entire level as well.Doom 3's story is...well, it exists. For the most part, it doesn't detract from the game. You might wonder what Doom is doing with such an overt story, but really, iD couldn't not write one in 2004. Games had come a long way since 1993, and writing in games at the time was just starting to become more than a vestigial element. Of course, Doom 3 also came before the time when some people realized that while not every game needs a thin layer of contrived plot, games as a whole need good writing.In comparison, MachineGames' 2014 game Wolfenstein: The New Order (a continuation of iD's only shooter franchise older than Doom) has writing that adds to the game, and meanwhile the 2016 Doom reboot does a lot more than Doom 3 with less than what 3 has.Anyway. One of the two main problems here are the lack of sound effects in the audio logs, a problem I'll mention the System Shock games didn't have. The other is the fact that Dr. Betruger is by far the most corny, hokey, Snidely Whiplash-evil character in any FPS ever, and that's REALLY saying something.I don't even need to spoil the fact that he's evil because you see it coming from a mile away the moment you first see him. His name is literally German for 'betrayal'. He veers between creepy and funny nearly every time you hear him say you're DOOOOOMED!!! MUAHAHAHA!!! He's the one vestigal element Doom 3 would have been almost entirely better off without.This game was honestly never going to live up to the originals. Mainly because the originals were much more progressive and envelope-pushing at exactly the right time, and were much more flexible to boot, but also because they were products of the late stage of videogaming's 'childhood'.Doom 3, on the other hand, is a product of video gaming's adolescent period. It trades those gracefully aging MIDI riffs and pixels for surplus buckets of grimness and horror, a look that while probably very fluid and good for 2004, doesn't hold up that well today without mods. It's worth mentioning though that the game's code is very well-written, and that the most taxing element for 2004 PCs - the dynamic lighting engine - is still fairly impressive.Both of those accomplishments come with a caveat, however, in that the whole game could frankly be summed up as a long-form tech demo for the developers' id Tech 4 engine, which they later leased out to other developers. I will, at least, praise the interactive computer interfaces as being truly excellent and something I'd like to see more of today.Ultimately, if you're willing to put a little modding work into it and deal with the fact that, taking everything into account, this game is both lesser than and has aged more than the originals in its series, you will find a decent game.

												Doom 3 doesnt really have an aweful lot in common with the originals, theres alot less swarms of evil dudes and a bit less gratification when you send a demon back to hell via your shotgun. That being said, Doom 3 accomplishes alot. It was way ahead of its time with the monster behaviour displayed with in the game and has cutting edge high res graffics that hold up against the tides of time quite well. (alot better then me anyways)I recommend doom as a terror / horror experience. although the 'ol Imp jumping out of a cupboard does get a little repetitive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good sci-fi horror game. Has a survival horror pace, not run and gun like classic Doom. It is a physically dark game, so if that's not your thing you might not love it. The graphics hold up reasonably well, though not as impressively as Half-life 2's. Turn up the volume and turn out the lights for the best experience. This original version is artistically superior to the BFG edition. Great atmosphere, sound, and story, I think they did a great job at realizing the Doom world! Great game for anyone who enjoys horror or science fiction.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There isnt much to say about Doom 3 except that the game was simply brillant. This game is a horror classic. If you are somebody that likes Call of Duty, or just a simple horror game, then this game is definetely for you. Doom 3 is about a marine in the year 2145 that goes on a ship to complete his mission. During the time he is on the space ship, hell breaks loose. There are demons, deadly spiders , zombies , and many fun to fight bosses. Again if you like either horror or FPS shooters than you really should play Doom 3.                                                   Game Score: 8 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So Steam Roulette selected DOOM3 to be game #2 of this year's Steam Backlog Blitz. At first I was kinda excited as I hadn't really touched DOOM3 since I bought x amount of years ago. I was recommended to download and use the sikkmod, which I too would recommend. Provides some nicely updated graphics and options to play around with. First thing I will say about this game is that it's long. Certainly long for a FPS, even more so compared to modern standards. You'll easily be playing this game for 12+ hours, which could be a good or a bad thing depending on what you like from a FPS. I personally found it a little too long, and according to Steam it took me 19 hours to finish this... It's a very slow paced game, which is odd for a DOOM title. Some might like that, but if you've grown up with DOOM and even DOOM II then it's a strange experience. They could easily have dropped a level or two from the middle of the game, or even had more 'traditional DOOM' levels as replacements. However, the slow pace of the game is highlighted nicely by the lighting and the sound within the game. I know some people didn't like the torch/weapon swapping, but I found it increased the level of tension within the game (however I did find it led to an increased level of bordem at times). Yet, the cheap scares and the over use of the one scare tactic do become tiresome very quickly. Overall it was an OK experience, if a little too long and not as frantic as I expected. Graphics, lighting and atmosphere are still good today as they would have been back in 2004. So credit must go to ID for that. If you play this in bitesized chunks you'll probably avoid the feeling of the game dragging on.If you see this cheap in the sales, have a good pair of headphones, and turn the lights off... you're in for a decent experience.

												Heyyo, This game is badass. The campaign is linear yes... but the action is awesome in-your-face spook moments much like F.E.A.R. emulated in their own game... This game also had incredible graphics for its time and they still look nice too.DON'T even bother trying Multiplayer. The netcode in ID Tech 5 is so incredibly bad? That even though servers are a max of 4 players, it lags insanely. It's definitely the worst reason to try this game... albeit the ""Last Man Standing"" co-op mod is plenty fun though. ;)There is also a great mod community for this game which you can find Doom 1 and 2 remakes... plus a Hexen mod! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was somewhat surprised, somewhere along the way Doom 3 gained a reputation for being slightly disappointing and not what the fans wanted? It is admittedly a very linear, setpiece-corridor sort of game full of formulaic jump-scares, but... It feels really well made and good. Everythings well executed and to my surprise it did actually have the feel of a classic doom game. It coulda done with more variation, but.. yeah. Also I didn't find the torch thing to be a real problem.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game to play even if it doesn't stick to the original DOOM and DOOM 2 game. I had fun shooting and blowing up spawns of satin while experiencing some of the jumpscares DOOM 3 had to offer. Having access to every weapon instead of limiting it to two is always fun to expierece because the more the marrier. Weapon progression in this game is enjoyable making players start form a lonely pistol to a BFG that kills everything in front of you because BIG F****** GUN! thats why. The plot is not simplified like the earlier titles but is still good and allows players to make a choice, a small one at that, to  send out a distress beacan or not . This choice is very minor and only effects the cutscene at the end making replaying the game for that choice not a big priority. The end boss battle feels a bit underwelming though as the player does nothing but run in a circle and wait for an item to charge up just to use it on the boss repeatedly. Finding PDA's for lore and locker codes is a great implimentation because it makes players search around the area if they want the goodies locked in that locker. Enemy variasion is good making players change tactics to tackle certain foes and introducing them is good as well. Replaying the game to have fun or experience a harder difficulty is fun and enjoyable as the game itself I feel can be played multiple times and still be fun. I recommend playing this game with sikkmod as it makes a game from 2003 look not only good but play better and smoother. Playing this game without sikkmod is okay too but the player will have to moddify the game anyway as the in game settings dosen't support 1920 by 1080p resolution. Information on the sikkmod modification and resoulution fix can be found in the forums.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was somewhat surprised, somewhere along the way Doom 3 gained a reputation for being slightly disappointing and not what the fans wanted? It is admittedly a very linear, setpiece-corridor sort of game full of formulaic jump-scares, but... It feels really well made and good. Everythings well executed and to my surprise it did actually have the feel of a classic doom game. It coulda done with more variation, but.. yeah. Also I didn't find the torch thing to be a real problem.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The sounds and the light effects give this game an incredible atmosfere. Even on 2015 its a recommended game, the graphics will look outdated but the fun and the horror will be better than some actual ""horror"" games.Some tips:-use a lot the button to switch your flashlight/favorite weapon-everytime you are gonna open a door open it and take a quick step back.-use your hearing to locate some enemies on the darkness.by the way i dont know who was the #$%#$%& that put so many monsters hidden behind the walls, its like ""hey we have a lot of secret storage spaces in all rooms, why not fill them with monsters?"", great idea			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well although it's not as good as the first two games in series, Doom 3 is an awesome game. Its atmosphere is quite like in the older games, but with the new flashlight thing going on. Some people didn't like this feature, but for me, it was a good way to scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me back when I first played it. The graphics were awesome back then and I still think they're gorgeous even on today's standards. The sound effects could be a little more ""brutal"". For exemple, the monster noises/ roars didn't sound like something that came directly from a hell portal, as the imp and hell knight's roar on Doom. Also the weapons didn't pack the punch like the chaingun or the shotgun on the older games. The shotgun shot noises just sound like an toy gun. And the gameplay although it's meant to be arcade like its predecessors, sometimes its dull. There are certain parts where monsters spawn exactly on the same place and if you die, you can just memorize when it'll come out and before the monster appears, you can just start to shoot on the spot to easily kill the monster.Aside from those little things, some small bugs and minor gameplay issues, I'd totally recommend it. Worth the time spent, I finished this game about 4-5 times or more. Also check for the hi-res modes on google, they're better than the BFG version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So Doom 3, the whole no flashlight on gun idea is original but quite annoying, and the one time you want a flashlight u lose it to a plot twist...sigh Gameplay is unique a first but you will hate the waves after a bit, bosses are unique and have interesting patterns/attacks., but after acquiring one item you can make it cakewalk The BFG is trash... overcharged it so many times. Ammo/Health packs etc seem to be fair and balanced, never starve for too long. The only down side to doom 3 is that the scariest parts are fatties with wrenches. Recommended if it goes around 5 dollars or less.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom3: A fun run on a space station. The game is pretty good, I tend to enjoy the interactive ingame screens and the audio logs; these were new concepts at the time. However the areas look so similar it gets monotonous just trying to run through the level. They also try to scare you relentlessly with voices and things poping around. This game just lacks the complexity and level design compared to halflife 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although this game by itself is good enough to be considered a pretty nice game, it lacks of the DOOM essence first introduced with Knee-Deep in the Dead. The gameplay is not as linear as the older ones, and it is full of reading and cinematics. Nothing more boring in a DOOM game if you ask me.However, the value of this game is not within the game itself, but within its engine and source code. Many modders have made a wonderful job creating new content for this engine. And one of the best of them is a recreation of the first installment of DOOM, Knee-Deep in the Dead, brought up-to-date with modern effects, AI, sounds and triggers!You can see it by yourself:

												The original overrated monster closet game.Doom 3 has been widely hailed as one of the scariest games ever made, presumably by the sort of people who think all it takes to file a movie under the horror genre is the presence of a monster and maybe turning a few lights off. Doom 3 is little more than Baby's First Dead Space, and while that's a little bit unfair as it obviously came well before its most obvious imitator, it isn't even remotely scary and is barely passable as a shooter.Let me start by approaching the horror half the of the equation: the primary emotion that horror feeds on is fear. Fear stems from vulnerability. Now, how can one possibly feel vulnerable while packing more firepower than a Texan wedding, up to and including two different instant-kill weapons? By far the most reliably lethal thing in the game was the bloody level design, between its clumsy platforming and occasionally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t set design (Oh, you shot this fragile glass fuel pipe in the midst of a close-quarters firefight? Enjoy instant vaporization, sucker). Meanwhile, the atmosphere the game attempted to set up was about as scary as Halloween decorations, so if you have a phobia of red color filters and balding middle-aged men laughing at you over the intercom, I suppose you might get a few frights out of it.As for the shooting... it's just not Doom. Every Doom game before or since has been high-octane shooty-bang action characterized by constant movement and overwhelming firepower on both sides. What it is NOT, is clomping down tight corridors with all the lights off fighting half a dozen enemies at a time - tops - while the lackluster sound design robs you of any situational awareness so the game can 'scare' you with some zombie twatbasket smacking you on the back of your head because somehow a trained marine can't pick up on an obese corpse shambling up behind him on noisy grate floors.I haven't played the Resurrection of Evil expansion yet, but I'll review that seperately when I do. As for Doom 3 itself, I'd rather just play Dead Space again. Or that System Shock remake, when that comes out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I literally s*** my pants.First corner I turned to find an imp on all fours, coiled and ready to strike a split second after making eye contact, I ruined my first pair of pants in years. Don't get me wrong, I foolishly put my trust in a treacherous fart every now and again. But this was complete Chocolate Chernobyl. I haven't done that since I was 25 or so when a bunch of bacon exploded while I was cooking. Luckily for my denim leggings of Levi, they weren't equipped at the moment. My +3 sword of bad ideas and sack of scratching though...Anyway, here are the pros and cons of this game:Pros:1. AMAZING graphics for the age of this game. Mods out there still available to make them even better. JUST READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!! (Or your game will look like Doom on the SNES with a bad Game Genie code.)2. Great mesh of HOLY F****** S*** swarms and ""didn't I just pee ten minutes ago?"" suspense.3. Actually has a plot. Kind of. I dug it. If you don't like it then you're mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries. Read the Doom books too. They're not terrible like everyone says in the reviews.4. Better than the BFG edition. You can actually find mods for this version. Play them both and you'll find more differences that favor this original version.5. Has an easy level that makes the game accessible to geezers like me.6. Has a hard level that will make your nephew realize he's not as f****** cool as he thinks he is just because I HAPPEN to allow him to use me as bait in FPS's. I could ""pwn n00bs like a boss"" if I wanted, I just choose to not hit anything I pretend to aim at on purpose.7. Great responsive and precise controls.8. Terrifies small children so they decide to go play with Rx rattles and hair driers in the bathtub instead of being up your a** all the time while you're trying to ignore them.Cons:1. You cannot eat anything with dairy in it the entire day before playing.2. You will still poop at least a little bit.3. It's so immersive you may forget there are children and/or animals in the house until after the fact when the entire place is destroyed and you wonder just how in the h*** you didn't hear any of it. Because the big screen falling onto a glass table HAD to be loud. Maybe that explains that demon that came through the window behind you then vanished?I highly recommend this game! Just go out and buy some Depends while it's downloading.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My +3 sword of bad ideas and sack of scratching though...Anyway, here are the pros and cons of this game:Pros:1. AMAZING graphics for the age of this game. Mods out there still available to make them even better. JUST READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!! (Or your game will look like Doom on the SNES with a bad Game Genie code.)2. Great mesh of HOLY F****** S*** swarms and ""didn't I just pee ten minutes ago?"" suspense.3. Actually has a plot. Kind of. I dug it. If you don't like it then you're mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries. Read the Doom books too. They're not terrible like everyone says in the reviews.4. Better than the BFG edition. You can actually find mods for this version. Play them both and you'll find more differences that favor this original version.5. Has an easy level that makes the game accessible to geezers like me.6. Has a hard level that will make your nephew realize he's not as f****** cool as he thinks he is just because I HAPPEN to allow him to use me as bait in FPS's. I could ""pwn n00bs like a boss"" if I wanted, I just choose to not hit anything I pretend to aim at on purpose.7. Great responsive and precise controls.8. Terrifies small children so they decide to go play with Rx rattles and hair driers in the bathtub instead of being up your a** all the time while you're trying to ignore them.Cons:1. You cannot eat anything with dairy in it the entire day before playing.2. You will still poop at least a little bit.3. It's so immersive you may forget there are children and/or animals in the house until after the fact when the entire place is destroyed and you wonder just how in the h*** you didn't hear any of it. Because the big screen falling onto a glass table HAD to be loud. Maybe that explains that demon that came through the window behind you then vanished?I highly recommend this game! Just go out and buy some Depends while it's downloading.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom 3 is slower-paced than Doom 2; has worse level design than Doom 2; is less immersive than Doom 2 (stop pulling the camera away from first-person you ♥♥♥♥♥); has messy convoluted objectives whereas Doom 2 had the perfectly substantial 'find the exit'. Also, why the hell did they give the protagonist such an irritating voice, or one at all for that matter?Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised by Doom 3. I was expecting it to be worse than the classic Doom games that we're all so fond of -- and in the aforementioned ways it certainly is -- but overall it turned out to simply be different to them.The old formula is still here: get from A to B, shoot the monsters between you and B, pick up armour, health and ammo along the way. The gameplay hasn't been changed into dull survival horror or cover-based shooting or anything modern and awful like that. It's just been slowed down a tad and made a bit scarier and more realistic, and for many people that'll definitely be a good thing. On top of that, Doom 3 obviously has far better visuals than the old games in both realism and artistic prowess. Pretty demons are always more fun to shoot than ugly ones.So even if you love Dooms 1 & 2 and are terrified of change, I'd say there's a good chance you'll still love the shiny latest addition to the family. You just won't love it for quite the same reasons.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good horror game, i played it with lights off and sound decently hi.On a few moments fear numbed my right hand, making me unable to move the mouse, and eventually reload the game after being eliminated. One of those moments was at the WC mirror... (those who played know what i am talking about).Now, do i recommend it? Well if you like pure fear and horror, and first person shooters, and blood, and demon all over the place hunting you... i do recommend it. Let me notice that the final boss was somewhat disappointing for me...anyway good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was really hard for me to recommend this game initially. I had played 5-6 levels and I was getting increasingly frustrated with the game. It felt nothing like Doom, and worse still it didn't feel fun at all. Read on and I'll tell you why you should get this game anyway.First off: This game is old. It runs by default in 4:3 resolution. You can find several solutions to this in the forums.Doom 3 tries really hard to be FEAR, Half-Life and Doom all at the same time. It takes a more realistic, dark and gritty approach to the original Doom storyline. It replaces frantic gun-blazing and monsterspamming with dark, gloomy and ""scary"" corridors with fewer, more powerful enemies. This in itself is not a bad thing. After all, Half-Life was a great game!The narrative is mostly told through voice overs or found PDAs. I kinda like this approach, it keeps you inside the world. Where this game suffers really badly is the actual gameplay. It tries really hard to be scary and it shows. It's pretentious at best and ham-fisted at worst when it comes to the so called ""scary moments"" with color shifts, lights going out and comically overplayed ""evil laughs"" echoing through the halls. The guns feel like pellet guns. There is no punch to any of the weapons, the sound assets for them are extremely weak and there is no satisfying feel to any of the weapons when you fire them. Enemies feel bullet-spongy and have a really annoying habit of not being present in the game world until you pass a certain trigger. This leads to excessively annoying moments where enemies keep coming from areas that you have already cleared. It's almost every single time you encounter enemies you'll have some coming from behind you. This can be cool for some panic induced fighting on occasion, but this game does it every single time and it gets old FAST.Now, with all these problems, why do I recommend it? Because I got fed up and installed Doom 3 XTRA mod. This mod updates graphics, model assets, textures and sounds to a more modern standard, but it also fixes all the problems I have with the gameplay. By giving weapons more punch and over all more satisfying oomph and sounds, it makes the shooting fun again. Sure the game is still overly pretentious with its scary ""jack in a box"" moments and enemies always coming from behind, but you know what? With Doom 3 XTRA I don't give a ♥♥♥♥. Thar be demons to shoot in the face!So in short, if you intend to get this game don't even bother with the stock game. Doom 3 XTRA turns this game from a boring yawnfest into a frantic shooter with some ignorable issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom reimanged as a survival horror, corridor shooter. For 2004, this was a fresh take on a genre of games that were dominated by arena shooters, and Half-Life clones. More story then the original games, with an emphesis of horror and atmosphere. A classic, that was later polished too hard in a rerelased BFG edition.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DOOM 3 isn't fast paced like the previous DOOMs, but its slower pace lets you soak in the great atmosphere. Plus this game has a lot of details in the world, like the PDAs and secret areas. It lets the UAC base on mars feel alive and like it could be a real place. The story is also surprisingly good, for a DOOM game. I would recommend DOOM 3 to DOOM fans, id Software fans, and anyone wanting an action game with a little horror in it.9/10(but I like DOOM 3: BFG Edition more)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doom 3 is a damn fine shooter! I have no idea why people are so split about this game.Pros:+ Great graphics (especially at the time) and amazing lighting. (And even better with sikkmod)+ Incredible level design, it's really hard to get lost in these levels.+ Pretty good voice acting.+ Entertaining story.+ Quite a long campaign (8-10 hours).+ Great mix of horror and action.Neutral:+- You have to switch back and forth between your flashlight and you weapons. This can be immersive or annoying depending on the person.+- The game gives you a ridiculous amount of ammo, therefore not really bringing in a sense of tension. I have seen other people mention that ammo is sparse, but one must require an impressively itchy trigger-finger in order to run dry. I mean honestly, I can't recall a single moment I had less than 200 shotgun shells at my disposal.Cons:- Cheap enemy placements. You will frequently run into imps that pounce at you placed behind doors, that gain aimbot abilities, and can turn 90 degrees around corners. Unless you have godlike reactions, this will hurt you, and maybe kill you. A lot.- Can get a little repetetive, both in gameplay and locations.- The weapons are a little wierdly implemented. The pistol and your fists are basically useless after the first 15 minutes, and your shotgun's range is so hilariously bad, it's basically a meleeweapon. I reccomend downloading the realistic weapons mod to fix some of these weird design choices. : http://www.moddb.com/mods/realistic-weapons/downloads/doom-3-realistic-weapons-v10A great action- adventure game you can get for dirt cheap. Absolutely reccomended. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | 2 *3*] = ~88% (75%-100%)Doom 3 (published 2004) is an awesome hellish corridor shooter with a great (albeit simple) campaign story, if you please ignore that demons from Hell should be unimpressed by earthly firepower.It's a very immersive ride that I have taken from A to Z at least 4 times. If you want to forget the world and live through a demonic science fiction story, Doom 3 is the way to go.The sounds require a bit of getting used to because they are equalized / dynamic compressed too extremely (though not as insanely as in Bioshock Infinite), but after a while this will feel alright.People say that Doom 3 is visually too dark, but what they are missing is that this is a game for serious gamers who want to go on an immersive ride instead of just having fun in the living room with friends. So, turn off the lights, use a big screen, tweak the FOV (The console allows to set anything you want.), and get lost for 12-18 hours in a dark science fiction tale that, while kind of routine once you know how to handle your weapons, will keep you on the edge throughout.Some people don't like that it takes a while before the action starts. Those, too, are not serious gamers. Drink up the mood! Role-play! Explore this science fiction reality while you're not yet under pressure and while things are still well lit.TECHDoom 3 uses real-time lighting throughout, and I believe it was even the first 3D 1st person campaign shooter that did this. While this has visual downsides (especially since the engine is old, so there is no hint of Global Illumination) compared to baked light-maps, it contributes immensely to the experience, and they show it off in quite a few places. Try to imagine what it's like to see this for the first time. Oooh! Aaah! Who wants to touch me.Both Doom 3 and the BFG edition can be modded, but not all D3 mods work with D3BFG. I played through the unchanged version of both and enjoyed both. I copy&pasted this review text to both.The Doom 3 title music is mono and very badly equalized - sounds like complete crap. Yay, a DVD-sized game, and they saved 2 MB on the title track. :( And guess what they did not change when they created the BFG edition - yep, as unfathomable as it may seem, the crappy title music file. In Doom 3 (Non-BFG.), you could at least easily mod the title music by supplying a file (incl. path) of the same name as it was in the data archive files, so I obtained a better sounding (and stereo) version of the track and even equalized it for more boom. Well, apart from this drastic oversight, Doom 3 is a great product.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I defintly recomend it. I personly love it the first quarter! The setting, visuals, and ambience is amazing. Sadly, the gameplay plays slow and clunky later when it ries to be like doom 1 and 2. Most of the guns are weak and underpowered and that's a good thing! Exept in the middle. The ending is amazing and beggining is ultra amazing sandwhich power 360. The middle sucks.  Also, the surival element isn't much needed in lesser diffucluties, other than searching the darkness just for a imp to lunge at you behind a door.7 for you, 9.5 for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By far out of ALL of the 108 games I have, the scariest game I've played. 1. It won't matter how much you turn up the bright-ness it won't get brighter in the environment. 2. Like most alien games you're isolated from human life. 3. You're fighting highly agile, damaging demon/alien sons of b#tches. 4. Scary f#cking sound effects everywhere. 5. Any hidden ammo/armor/health you find torsos of f#cking babies with fly wings will thrust themselves at you with their faces and scare the sh#t out of you. 10/10 Sci-fi horror, Doom will never cease to be a good game.

												Doom 3 is a FPS Horror shooter game. The game is challenging, enemeis you face are horrific looking and interesting to fight, you have an arsenal of weapons you can use to survive on Mars. I've play this game along time ago when I was 4 years old (And no, I surpisely didn't get nightmares, mainly because I didn't know what was going and all I knew was point at the enemy and shoot), and this for brought back memories of playing this game. I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a horror game that has guns to use, and a interesting story to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was really hard for me to recommend this game initially. I had played 5-6 levels and I was getting increasingly frustrated with the game. It felt nothing like Doom, and worse still it didn't feel fun at all. Read on and I'll tell you why you should get this game anyway.First off: This game is old. It runs by default in 4:3 resolution. You can find several solutions to this in the forums.Doom 3 tries really hard to be FEAR, Half-Life and Doom all at the same time. It takes a more realistic, dark and gritty approach to the original Doom storyline. It replaces frantic gun-blazing and monsterspamming with dark, gloomy and ""scary"" corridors with fewer, more powerful enemies. This in itself is not a bad thing. After all, Half-Life was a great game!The narrative is mostly told through voice overs or found PDAs. I kinda like this approach, it keeps you inside the world. Where this game suffers really badly is the actual gameplay. It tries really hard to be scary and it shows. It's pretentious at best and ham-fisted at worst when it comes to the so called ""scary moments"" with color shifts, lights going out and comically overplayed ""evil laughs"" echoing through the halls. The guns feel like pellet guns. There is no punch to any of the weapons, the sound assets for them are extremely weak and there is no satisfying feel to any of the weapons when you fire them. Enemies feel bullet-spongy and have a really annoying habit of not being present in the game world until you pass a certain trigger. This leads to excessively annoying moments where enemies keep coming from areas that you have already cleared. It's almost every single time you encounter enemies you'll have some coming from behind you. This can be cool for some panic induced fighting on occasion, but this game does it every single time and it gets old FAST.Now, with all these problems, why do I recommend it? Because I got fed up and installed Doom 3 XTRA mod. This mod updates graphics, model assets, textures and sounds to a more modern standard, but it also fixes all the problems I have with the gameplay. By giving weapons more punch and over all more satisfying oomph and sounds, it makes the shooting fun again. Sure the game is still overly pretentious with its scary ""jack in a box"" moments and enemies always coming from behind, but you know what? With Doom 3 XTRA I don't give a ♥♥♥♥. Thar be demons to shoot in the face!So in short, if you intend to get this game don't even bother with the stock game. Doom 3 XTRA turns this game from a boring yawnfest into a frantic shooter with some ignorable issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back in 2004 this gamed looked amazing and I scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta myself when I played this game when it was first released, and I hadn't really given it a good crack since then, so I bought it again and modded the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it to find that - it looks amazing and I scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta myself again. Granted the textures can look a tad low-res without mods, but I suppose that's not so much a negative point as it is a fact of life - for a 10 year old game it's fantastic, and, true to id's style, it's still as fantastically playable as it was back then. Not to mention the fact that, while you adapt your tactics and learn to fight the enemies better as the game goes on - meaning perhaps you are less subtly scared that you were when you started the game -  it's still an anxiety-riddled, delightfully stressful experience from start to finish. Highly recommended, and if you like you can grab as many of the well-known graphics mods as you can to bring it into the next gen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't bother with the BFG edition it alters the torch mechanic by having it suit mounted so you can use it with a gun spoiling the original game balance. You can also improve the graphic settings and widescreen modes by using a mod such as Absolute HD mod. Graphically it's just as shiney as the BFG edition. Absolute HD also incorperates the Sikkmod which enables you to aim down sights. A worthy sequal to Doom 2 in a sci fi horror style that is very atmospheric. I say that as someone who has been playing Doom 2 for around 21 years. I couldn't play Doom 3 in 2004 as at the time of release as my computer then wasn't powerful enough then. To get the most out of it start on the Veteran (Hard) setting as Marine (normal) is abit too easy			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We at UAC take pride in our safety record, so please do not try grabbing ANY items whatsoever because if you do, those little monster closets WILL open and you WILL have your face eaten by malevolent demonic minions. Yeah, go on, try and grab that shotgun, we dare you! We shall subsequently enjoy watching the floor unexplicably giving way, dropping you in the middle of a dark zombie infested labyrinth! Oh, and also a demon has just teleported in, fresh out of hell, right behind your back. And he brought friends. Enjoy your stay on Mars!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is essiantially Half-Life 2 (when used with RoE) except for monster closets, satan, lower res graphics, crappy pistol models, and rooms darker than a middle school student's sense of humor. This isn't good as a Doom game, but when you look at it as a stand alone game, it's decent. The BFG Edition is highly reccomended if you want to use a flashlight and pump 20 pounds of buckshot into a security zombie who keeps dodging behind cover before you hit him. If you prefer a test of your insanity buy the original and hold the flashlight and bludgeon Imps with a flashlight while screaming, ""RIP AND TEAR!"" and then proceed to get covered in small spiders that eventually kill you and use ur corpse as a nest. And then... the dead community of the multiplayer... more empty then the energy of that one nerdy, awkward kid in gym that no one really ever talks too.

It feels more slow pased, and it isn't that scary except for some parts. But It looks great, and this is a game for 2003. The gunplay is good, and there are some parts that feel doom like for the most part. The BFG version is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you really want to make the graphics better, theres lots of mods for that.

												tl:dr it's like half-life, but on mars. the game feels more frustrating than it should be (on hard difficulty) not sure if it's hit detection or what, but most of my damage output felt inoncistent. sometimes i would 1 shot imps with a shotgun and sometimes i'd empty entire magezines to no avail. the enemy ai is rock stupid consisting of only charging your position be it with guns, hellfire, w/e, and any hitscan weapons they use are nearly 100% accurate so there's no chance you'll be dodging anything that isn't a projectile. however, the enemy types are extremely varied and numerous which forces you to pick the right weapon for the situation. every encounter feels like a pop quiz of ""which weapon is most effective against this enemy"" and i think this is where the enjoyment can be found. i never felt like i was killed from something unfair becuase if you pick the right weapon for the right enemy, you can survive anything.the campaign was much longer than i expected and it was for the most part a logical progression. the character you play known only as ""the marine"" is your standard emotionless silent protagonist who is transferred the a mars base as security. your day starts off normal until you walk for a while and everything goes batsh*t crazy. (sound familair?) when the game finally picks up you're constantly being barked at to move faster by your CO who apparenly isn't dealing with the limitless demons that you are because he has plenty of time to tell you to pick up the pace.the game isn't terrible by any means, but it has very little personalty to it.  nameless marine fights nameless demons who are being controlled by obvious badguy. i'd suggest picking this up on sale, but other than that, it's not worth full price			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's dark. It's heavily scripted. There are jump scares. You will learn to anticipate them and track enemies in the dark and then it won't be that scary. In fact, you'll probably be frustrated more than anything else, especially if you don't quicksave. At the end of the day though, it's a good, filling experience, well worth the purchase. Once you get the bigger weapons towards the end of the campaign it almost feels like Painkiller, just with more mundane weapons. Except for one of them, but you can figure that out yourself.AFAIK the multiplayer is dead, so you should only buy this if you're interested in between 10-15 hours (20 if it's your first time playing and you keep dying to surprises like I did) of timeless single-player FPS action, roughly four parts shooting to one part clicking on buttons and one part awkwardly fumbling around with the flashlight.

												DOOM 3 tells the story of John Doom, the world's first homosexual martian. After a straight scientist opens up a portal to Straighttown, the straightest planet in the Straight Galaxy, John Doom must take everything he knows about love and throw it out the window in exchange for the ability to slaughter hundreds of ghouls and goblins (or as they're know in the game, Straight people)Like many first person shooters, DOOM 3 is boring and tedious, but thankfully makes up for this fact by making sure you can't see anything 3 feet in front of you.

												Doom 3 isn't a very good game unless you know how to create an autoexec.cfg file inside the Doom 3 Base folder.  That's especially true for the Steam version.  There are mods for Doom 3.  I recommend Cam's Gameplay Mod v2.6.  That mod will add a permanent flashlight to all guns and make the guns more effective.  Doom 3 can support high-resolution monitors if you add some commands to the autoexec.cfg file.  I've never played Doom 3 BFG Edition.  The fact that it doesn't support mods was what convinced me not to buy it.  Nevertheless, I've heard that the BFG Edition has smoother gameplay, a permanent flashlight for all guns, and slightly better graphics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a good game for what it is, but if you're expecting balls to the walls rip n tear action like the other games, you won't get it here. It feels more slow pased, and it isn't that scary except for some parts. But It looks great, and this is a game for 2003. The gunplay is good, and there are some parts that feel doom like for the most part. The BFG version is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you really want to make the graphics better, theres lots of mods for that. If you're a die hard doom fan, go for it. Though I'd wait for a sale. The expansion is good as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would give Doom 3 at least an 8/10. Now, don't think this is bad. I really enjoyed Doom 3 but my fealings go towards that I think they tried to hard. They were stuck with the old play style at little too much. Like, I get it that they would leave some play styles in such that were in it's predecessors, but too much so. A lot of the gameplay was dull and the scares became stale and lifeless. Even the Hell scene was kinda boring, it lasted like 10 minutes. I have to say though, the Cyberdemon fight was amazing. I really liked it, it truely felt like you were fighting a gigantic beast to save all of humanity. All in all, if you liked the earlier Dooms, I would give this one a chance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is still amazing, considering it has now 10 years on its back.This feels old school enough....I had almost forgot how it was to shoot enemies who didn't just stay in cover and pop their heads out for you to get headshots with a pad (COD, anyone?). The marine-zombies will get your flanks, run at you and melee strike your face, and demons would throw fireballs from all sides.Graphically it is also very well aged....doesn't look 'old' at all. Such a shame they did release the BFG edition....if you are wondering which one to get, get this version. This is the original version, the BFG version adds useless stuff and simplifies the game a lot (more ammo, less damage taken, holding the light while aiming and so on).By editing the ini files you can choose whatever resolution you want. So there IS support for widescreen (not natively, just google and edit the necessary files). It runs perfectly even on my surface pro 2!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I wouldn't really call it a Doom game, it is a fun horror and sci-fi shooter with decent graphics, cool weapons, and a lot of visual and technical mods that is still fun to play to this day.Unfortunately, the Steam version has some serious problems. Graphical glitches and crashes to desktop are the smaller problems. However, I swear that at least ten times, the game has managed to crash my internet router. I don't know how it's happening, but I know all these bugs are at least directly correlated to how many times I load maps in the game in one sitting. Bottom line is that it's annoying, and it ruins the pacing at which the game can be enjoyed.I suggest a hard copy. I had one once, and had none of the problems I've had with this version.

												tl:dr it's like half-life, but on mars. the game feels more frustrating than it should be (on hard difficulty) not sure if it's hit detection or what, but most of my damage output felt inoncistent. sometimes i would 1 shot imps with a shotgun and sometimes i'd empty entire magezines to no avail. the enemy ai is rock stupid consisting of only charging your position be it with guns, hellfire, w/e, and any hitscan weapons they use are nearly 100% accurate so there's no chance you'll be dodging anything that isn't a projectile. however, the enemy types are extremely varied and numerous which forces you to pick the right weapon for the situation. every encounter feels like a pop quiz of ""which weapon is most effective against this enemy"" and i think this is where the enjoyment can be found. i never felt like i was killed from something unfair becuase if you pick the right weapon for the right enemy, you can survive anything.the campaign was much longer than i expected and it was for the most part a logical progression. the character you play known only as ""the marine"" is your standard emotionless silent protagonist who is transferred the a mars base as security. your day starts off normal until you walk for a while and everything goes batsh*t crazy. (sound familair?) when the game finally picks up you're constantly being barked at to move faster by your CO who apparenly isn't dealing with the limitless demons that you are because he has plenty of time to tell you to pick up the pace.the game isn't terrible by any means, but it has very little personalty to it.  nameless marine fights nameless demons who are being controlled by obvious badguy. i'd suggest picking this up on sale, but other than that, it's not worth full price			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's dark. It's heavily scripted. There are jump scares. You will learn to anticipate them and track enemies in the dark and then it won't be that scary. In fact, you'll probably be frustrated more than anything else, especially if you don't quicksave. At the end of the day though, it's a good, filling experience, well worth the purchase. Once you get the bigger weapons towards the end of the campaign it almost feels like Painkiller, just with more mundane weapons. Except for one of them, but you can figure that out yourself.AFAIK the multiplayer is dead, so you should only buy this if you're interested in between 10-15 hours (20 if it's your first time playing and you keep dying to surprises like I did) of timeless single-player FPS action, roughly four parts shooting to one part clicking on buttons and one part awkwardly fumbling around with the flashlight.

												In its original form (ie without mods) Doom 3 is incredibly bland and unsatisfying. I tried to like it for so long because the graphics, at the time, were basically unmatched, like the Doom titles before it. But even as a young lad back in the early 2000s this game was way too boring for me. The combat itself felt incredibly flat even compared to the original Doom games. Enemy bodies disappear before they even hit the ground. The guns sound like♥♥♥♥♥♥ The level design may have gone over well in the mid to late 90s but by the time this game came out it felt anachronistically bland - basically just long metal corridor after long metal corridor. Say what you want about Halo 1's level design, at least you'd go outside and have a change of scenery every once in a while. In this game, all you do is plod around and shoot at enemies with your clunky Mattel toy gun and watch as the enemies disappear before you have a chance to see the ragdoll physics, set in a universe where light only comes in two forms -  brighter than the sun or darker than space. I suspect alot of people are projecting their love of the series as a whole onto this game individually when they praise it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I can't play any horror game out there where you're defenseless, I'm too sissy. But in Doom 3, hell yeah I feel like this hero with the power on my hands (big weapons) and able to make a difference. With some mods, the game doesn't show age, while having that old school horror atmosphere. A worthy successor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I just finished this, and here are my thoughts. It's okay, though I really prefer the classic Doom titles. Has a very large horror theme, but it's not the same Doom.Pros: Has veteran enemies, weapons, etc, has some references to the classic franchise. Cons: The flashlight is very annoying when switching, Too dark, needs 16:9 support, Cyberdemon battle was very lame, earlier maps lacks ammo scattered, didn't really like the code input vaults idea, weapons are very weak.6.5 / 10 I do know BFG Edition fixed some of these issues, but meh. The game is not bad, nor good, it's only in the middle, mostly because im more used to the classic titles. I'd recommend this game if your into horror games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												--- DOOM 3 ---The good stuff...- Good graphics with audio in world class.- Tight controls.- Scary as hell - DOOM 3 relay on audio/music to be scary and keep the player on edge at all times, just like any good horror movie - play it alone in the middle of the night with the volume cranked. Bring extra underwear.- ID's attention to details are amazing as usual.- The game has been nicely balanced and offer a challenge, even if you are good at shooters.The bad stuff...- A little too much emphasis on horror and lacks somewhat in the action department - it should be the other way around like the old-school DOOM games.- Even if the environments are beautifully crafted they do get old - pretty quick. It's tight, it's dark, there are long hallways with at least one jump scare somewhere..... and rinse and repeat. Final verdict...8/10 - just buy the game - it's DOOM and it's good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												!!Important note!!If you don't own doom and doom 2, you will probably better off buying the Doom BFG edition. with that you get doom 3, resurrection, doom and doom 2,  you also get the lost mission expansion pack which is an exclusive expansion pack for the BFG edition and you also get an extra episode for doom 2 called no rest for the living. Doom and Doom 2 can also be played on the GZdoom source port as well. Just remember to check the system requirements for the BFG edition because they are much more demanding compared to the original doom 3 and resurrection games. The BFG edition doesn't have finale doom or the master levels.      What I liked about the game•	Fantastic level design, I liked the industrial/science setting of the game. I liked seeing all of the machines in the environment working and all of the computers showing lots of information.•	Interesting story on how the demon invasion happened. •	The game has a good horror atmosphere, there are also some jump scares and unexpected moments, it's not up there with fear or condemned but it's still good. •	Plenty of secrets to be found, some are hidden in quite clever places. With some of the secrets, you have to interact with the in-game computer to find them. You can find PDA'S of other workers at the UAC, which tells you what there work role, was. The PDA'S also contain audio logs, emails and also give you security clearances. You can also find video disks, which have information on them about certain things.  •	An awesome selection of firearms. My favourite weapons in the game were the machinegun and the plasma gun. •	Lots of different enemies to kill. Most of the enemies in doom and doom2 are in this game (IMP, Pinkie, Commando, and the lost souls); there are also some new enemies as well. Amazing boss fights, especially the 2nd boss fight and the last. Brilliant antagonist, Dr Malcolm Betruger.  •	 I know some people won't agree with this but, I quite liked the changes they made to doom 3, like making it slower paced, concentrating more on the horror experience and concentrating more on the story. It was something new and after playing doom, doom 2, finale, and master, I don't think I would enjoyed it as much if the game play in doom 3 was the same as the previous games. That's my opinion anyway.•	I prefer this version over  the BFG edition. I like how you have to equip the flashlight and you don't have to turn it off to let it recharge. I would say this version is much challenging. I found that certain types of ammo in this version were much scarcer.   •Awesome music theme.What I disliked or was disappointed with•	No Baron Of Hell •	The death animations aren't very good, the demons just frizzle up. •	The character you play as doesn't look very badass. The character in resurrection of evil looks much better. • I wish the game could autosave more often.   ConclusionOne of my all time favourite games. If you liked Quake 4, Prey or Fear I highly recommend you buy this game. 95/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not the DOOM 3 We were Hoping ForWell.. this is a hardone. I normally start these out with something along the lines of: ""If you liked X you'll like this game."", but for the life of me I can't think of a game close enough to this to liken it to.  I certainlty Can't say: ""If you liked Doom or Doom 2 , you'll love this game."", because the game takes a sharp departure in aesthetics, play-style and ... AH-HA! Dead Space. If you liked Dead Space you... er, never mind. That's just it, the game feels like iot was the victim of schizophranic development. GOne now are the fast-paced, cirlcle-strafing, Shotgun-Blasting, Demon-Splattering game we remember from Doom 2. Now replaced by dark, Claustrophobic,  corridors and cheap jumpscares.Doom3 tries to be somewhere Between Dead Space and System Shock 2 and manages to be neither.  Now credit where credit is due. The game looks gorgeous and atmospheric., when you can actuially see anything. THe Mars base actually feels like the sort of place people work and live in.  However this sort of upsets the game flow and I can't help but feel the darkness and tight corridors were there to compensate for the engine limitations, you know like the fog in Silent Hill. Unlike Silent Hill where the fog, combined with the open environment, created an an atmosphere of dread and uneasiness, DOom3's darkness is at first dread inducing  but quickly becomes just plain annoying.The game also cheats. It has a nasty habit of spawning units just out of sight so you think you missed something. And no this isn't the normal teleport with the evil light show. These arr enemies literally just blinking into existence where the designer feels the player will not be looking, like on the other side of a closed door you just came through.THougjh the question to answer is, can I recommend this game. Yes, but do not pick it uop if you're hoping for a good follow-up to the classic Doom games, taken as a generic, sci-fi horror, the game holds up decently, taken as a Doom game, not so much. If you never played the classics, this won't be a bad game for you. Wait for it to go on sale, otherwise I recommend the more recent  installment. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Better than the brainless shooter♥♥♥♥♥♥they did with the new DOOM.Yes of course DOOM was in the beginning a shooter and story didn't matter as much as it did in DOOM 3, but they made both into one game. And now they created a shooter that exists a million times already.The story made the game more spooky and with that it's acceptable as horror game. I was scared plenty of times during the first gameplay. I was paranoid because it was one of my first horror games. It has plenty of features and they love the detail. Physics in not bad and you have both offensive and defensive parts. Also depends on how you play the game in the end.The new DOOM has nothing to do with horror anymore. It's just gore and rambo. DOOM 3 was the reason I wanted the new DOOM. The gameplays in the other hand showed me it's nothing like that. Yeah awards and ratings and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, CoD is♥♥♥♥♥♥and has plenty of both thanks to its massive kiddiesupport. That's not quality, it's quantity with high loads of♥♥♥♥♥♥If you want an adequate story, buy DOOM 3, if you want ""boom boom with ugly space thingy *uga uga*"" well then you'll be satisfyied with the new trash.

												Now I will start of this review with I love this game but coming back to it I can't recommend playing the vanilla version of this game because the graphics of this version has not aged well I would recommend getting the Absolute HD 1.6 mod if you plan to buy this game.So what can I say about Doom that hasn't already been said its gory, its bloody and just outright brutal but this game took it up a notch. You play as an unamed space marine stationed on Mars City run by the UAC (Union Aerospace Corporation) you happened to arrive on the same day something extraordinary happens where scientists decide to open a portal to hell but didn't think to shut it for some daft reason and it all goes to hell literally because lost souls, imps anything evil and nasty has come out to play with your body being their toy. This game happens to take a more survival horror approach with limited ammo, non-regenerative health and satan wanting to play a few too many pranks on you in many rooms and it works for the amount of time I have played this game which I mainly played it on the original Xbox I was really petrified and even more frightend on PC.This is a short review because everyone knows what Doom is.Overall Rating for the Vanilla version 7/10Overall Rating for the HD mod version 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is so lovely.It beats the new Doom 4 game many times over and over again.If you are standing for a choice between buying this, or buying the new Doom 4, buy this instead.(Or better: the BFG edition, then you get more for the bucks)You will enjoy it much more, I promise you.This review applies to Doom 3 and RoE, not the other doom games inside this package.First, you get that nice peaceful playable intro without action that almost every game have today.Such intros always gives you a nice entrypoint (where you come from and why) while it ""starts up""the story in a proper way, and also gives a exploration opportunity to learn more about thein-game world without being disturbed by enemies.Then, you get pretty much thinking. You must read PDA's, Emails, listen to audio logs, figure out codes to proceed. Sometimes you need to read Emails or listen to logs to figure out what to do next, for example where specific mission-criticalobjects are stored.And you get no help, you need to figure out platformingfor yourself when that becomes applicable.That makes it extra fun.Another nice thing is that many ingame objects notnecessary for progressing, is also interactive,so sometimes the object is just for fun/enjoyment,sometimes the object is just a red herring to foolyou into thinking this is the next step to take, whenit turns out its not(For example, a door that never can be unlocked,eg requires a PDA or keycard not in game).This interactivity also adds to realism and itmakes the game more fun to play.Also, the really nice thing is that you sometimesreturn to a central ""hub"" (so theres multiple ""hubs"")that is specific for the chapter you played, afterhaving collected some keycard/PDA or donesome objective, which makes it extra fun asyou get to revisit old places and take new paths from there. This gives you a more sense of the facility.Also, theres a lot of puzzles that you need to figure out,one notable example is the maintenace elevator/platform,where you are given a slight hint and you have to figurethe rest out itself.And the cryo storage bins puzzle is GREAT. First youthink its just a dead end but after a while you figure it out.And that lovely crane minigame with the toxic leaking barrelswas just beutiful.I could warmly recommend this instead of Doom 4.Put Doom 4 in the garbage bin and buy this instead!

												A fun, if simplistic, shooter. It is annoying that monsters pop out of closets, and bodies dissolve so you can't leave a trail of corpses (the original Doom was better for that). But unlike Doom 4 (2016), this doesn't have Denuvo or double-jumps, so is a better game than the 2016 reboot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is basically a dead space atmosphere game. I recommend you to play the classic doom or doom 4 if you're a big fan of doom. If you already played dead space or like the jumpscare, get this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DOOM 3 may not be scary per say but it definitely is a well-executed form of ACTION survival horror. I prefer the more subtle approach to horror (Silent Hill 2 and 3) but DOOM 3 manages to bring a interesting blend of action and horror thanks to it's crappy feeling guns, dark cramped rooms and bothersome flashlight. The story and characters are forgetable and the DOOM marine has clearly had some therapy compared to his other portrayals. Otherwise it's alright and priced accordingly. DOOM3 is more of an interesting footnote than a great game if you compare it to the legendary DOOM 1 and 2 but it's not too bad in spite of how it's aged when compared to other games like Half-Life 2.

												I didn't like doom 3 when i first played it about 5 years ago so i decided to buy the game on steam and give it another chance to see if my opinion changes. It hasn't.This is one of the most boring games i have ever played and it feels like such a slap in the face to fans of doom 1 and 2 like myself. The shooting feels so clunky, the guns sound weak as hell and combat in general just feels stiff and awful.It's one of the least scary 'horror' games i have ever played and I feel no tension as i'm playing it. The only scare that works is the bathroom mirror scare in the first hour of the game. Unless you are very easily scared this game cannot be called a horror game as it is marketed to be.The enemy design is so uninteresting and boring compared to doom 1 and 2 which had some of the most interesting and memorable enemy design in gaming history its just sad to look at in doom 3.The pacing is awful, you are fighting like 5 ememies at a time max and that's the most tension you will get out of the game is fighting a small bunch of enemies in very tight corridors. The pacing is very slow and boring. If the game didn't have such dull and boring level design and atmosphere maybe the slow pacing would have worked but it just doesn't.I have used the word boring so many times in this review but that's honestly the best way i can describe the game and my experience with it. Boring.3/10 (Bad)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
