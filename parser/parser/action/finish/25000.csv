Early Access Review
								Overgrowth is a third person action game where you get to play as giant rabbits, rats, wolves and more fighting against other rabbits, rats, wolves and more. The game's main selling point is it's brutal combat which is best witnessed in the arena where you are automatically pitted against enemies either with your bare hands or with one of the game's few weapons. If you don't want to play the arena you can wander around one of the game's other maps and if you wish you can even spawn in enemies to take on. Despite all of these features the game has one glaring issue which completely changes whether or not you should buy this game.+Great graphics+Brutal and enjoyable combat+You can slow down time+Good controls+Maps are quite nice and reasonably large+If you play on the arena you are automatically put in to teams (or not) to fight other enemies and you are equipped with weapons automatically+A number of different species you can play as+There are different challenges for you to complete+Good physics+Decent modding community+Good platforming mechanics-This game has been in Alpha since 2008 and it's currently on build 209, updates are few and far between and offer nothing more than bug fixes, they do not add any more ways to keep you playing and more importantly they still haven't added the campaign modes which were promised-Gets very repetitive very quickly-Horribly overpriced considering what you get-The game's platforming mechanics are wasted on the maps that are currently available, i.e. they're very flat maps or easy to get around-Frequent crashes-Long loading timesVerdict:Do not buy this game.It's a wonderful concept but I don't think the execution could be much worse and with it's current price tag and considering it's effectively just a tech demo with little to do you'd be wasting your money on a project that has been in Alpha for 7 years and is likely to remain in Alpha for the next 7 years.El K.

								Overgrowth. The game about bunnies and various other animals battling it out to prevent becoming a massive red mess of liquid and to feel the pain the usual ragdoll physic.As Overgrowth is currently still in early alpha and has been for a few years, a structured story still hasn't been implemented BUT the current 'challenges' keep you feeling amused and entertained. The main appeal about this game is the combat system (the best of any game I've ever witnessed). Every single encounter provides something new and makes you feel like a complete baddass if you are provided with a victory. The maps feel fresh and different and the in-game editor provides hours and hours of extra interest.BUY THIS NOW.(The steam game time doesn't represent what I've played, I've had it for around two years (as of Dec 2013) and I've probably stuck around 150 hours or so into the game as it wasn't on steam before.)

								An Early Access game still in it's very early stages (even though it has been in development for what... 8 years?) with basically no improvements or added features within the last two-three years. And it costs 30$.Do I.. need to say more?Edit. I was told to update my review, since apparently Overgrowth has received a bunch of updates as of late, and anything I say in this review doesn't make sense anymore.Well, I'm happy to report that Overgrowth is still in a very unacceptable state, considering all these years. Not much if anything significant has been improved.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Honestly, I can't recommend this game. Yes it's fun to play. Yes the combat is good. BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO DO. This game has been in Devlopment since 2008 and it's STILL in Early Access! That's ridiclous! There is nothing to do and it's still extremely glitchy even after 6 full years of development. It feels like something that should be worth about $5 and not $30 (which is how much I paid for it). The developers update it once every 3 months and seriously, what game has 200+ versions of alpha?!? ""It is still very much in development"" for how much longer? I'll be quiet happy when in 2030 The full game will probably be released at the rate they are making this game. Graphics 6/10Combat 9/10Replayability THERE IS NOTHING TO DO.Story ?/10Pick this up if it's on sale for $5 MAXIMUM.**EDIT/UPDATE**To the people saying that this is just ""a side project"" and that the team have full time jobs, go to the steam store and search up Unturned. That game was made BY A 16 YEAR old student and it already has more content than overgrowth. Students are the busiest people with all of their exams and homework and stuff but look at that kid. Did I mention that Unturned is FREE and this ""Development"" game is $30 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars?!? And Unturned is just one example of MANY games made by small groups of people in their free time, so don't give me ♥♥♥♥ing excuses that what they already implemented in this game is ""6 years of development"".**EDIT/UDATE** #2So most of you hav already listened to me and are not buying this game but there are still a few people who think Overgrowth is still in development because it's hard to make and such. And let me just start off by saying one of the BIGGEST issues I have with this game, it's enourmous price tag. A game this unfinished should be $5 maxium or less. Second thing I want to address that I have been getting alot of hate about: People are saying that in Untured (which is the game I used as an example of a different game)  has nothing in it, yea but that's the point it's FREE and he's updating it way more than overgrowth. Third issue probably the biggest one: Development rate, I know they have full time jobs and I KNOW  it's hard to program a game like this but COME ON people! This game updated like 5 times in this WHOLE YEAR (2014) and there was nothing added, nothing special that screamed ""Wow I really should play some of this game!"" it was mostly just animaton fixes and such. So for a gmae that costs $30 and tons of people bought it let's just say around 10,000 people bought this game at FULL price expecting a game: 30 x 10,000= $300,000. Where does that money go? straight into the devlopers pockets and you're not getting ANYTHING back.I think I have made my point here.			",556,208,15,43,70,8,80

Early Access Review
								EDIT: To clarify things, I owned Overgrowth a year before it came out on Steam; my Steam playtime is irrelevant.I make a point not to review games that are in alpha or beta until they're released, but I'll make an exception for Overgrowth for two simple reasons: (1) it's good enough to justify a $30 purchase even in its alpha builds, and (2) I consider it to be an absolutely enormous leap in the slow evolution of fighting games.When you preorder Overgrowth, you get immediate access to the current alpha build, so you can test everything out right away as the developers add stuff. This alleviates the usual problem with preordering games, that is, putting down money for a product that doesn't exist yet.The game itself currently boasts some of the smoothest, most fun, most intense combat of any game, ever, and I don't say that lightly. Overgrowth, like many indie games, uses physics as a driving mechanic. When you get kicked, your character reacts dynamically with a blend of animation and ragdoll. When you get stabbed, likewise. Dealing kicks and punches and slashes feels incredibly good -- the combat is fast-paced and frantic. Against more than one opponent, you'll almost inevitably lose unless your opponents are significantly slower or weaker than you, especially in a weapon fight.Let's talk about weapon combat for a moment: it's just as fast as the unarmed combat, maybe even faster in the case of the fencing swords and knives. It's one or two hits to a kill, so blocking and dodging is absolutely essential. The fights are cinematic and extremely satisfying (this applies to unarmed fights as well), especially if you hit the slow-motion key (currently tab by default) just as either combatant dies.The parkour can't go without mention. Though at this point in the game's development, the parkour is its weakest point (momentum doesn't carry while climbing), it's still ahead of many games with parkour elements. Wall-running, wall-jumping, and movement in genreral feel great. Everything flows together without the need for extraneous button-pressing, and when you do press a button, the resulting blended animation is a pleasure to watch. The only bad thing about the parkour, climbing, still isn't bad at all. It's still faster than most games, and still feels better than most games.I can't recommend Overgrowth enough. You could buy it for the combat alone (setting aside that there's going to be an actual story, with the writer's skill already demonstrated in a full-length comic over at Wolfire's home page). Overgrowth's combat, in my opinion, is the most fun of any melee combat game ever made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								EDIT August 2016: As of late I realized they have come back and started updating the game. I at the time, still don't recommend the game, but if you think you will like this game then check back regularly as it seems they are putting in a positive effort to get the game to a complete state.Someone else already explained it perfectly, so I will just briefly say, the game has been in development for from what I have heard, 7 years. There has not been an update for 4 months as of this post, and on top of that, most updates only fix animations, or something to do with the combat that is so minor it really doesn't seem necessary. On top of all of that, the support and feedback from developers when trying to contact them is non existent. I had contacted them multiple times about certain bugs that have never been fixed, and I had never received a reply. Lastly, due to the fact that this is still ""Alpha"", the game has many glitches and crashes quite often. I just got a new gaming laptop for over 1500 bucks, and it still crashes every 10 minutes or so. The one pro I have to say though, is that during the time that it does play, it is relatively fun to free run and fight, but really, that is all you can do. There is nothing to do but spawn enemies and fight, or run and climb things. If this game keeps updating at the pace that it is, there will most likely never be a completed game because it will be dropped eventually because there have been almost no noticeable changes at all in the past couple years.

								In development for seven years and still not complete. Wait for the overgrowth GOTY in 10 years.EDIT: Okay some people are a little angry that i'm not giving the game enough credit, because after all it's only one person working on it and they made a whole new game engine, but they did not make it from scratch, which good for them. Here's the problem, they're too ambitious they chose to keep improving the engine over actually making the game fun. When I purchased this game 2 years ago I assumed it would hit beta in one year, because that's how the development looked like it was going. Here's the thing is it feels like an advanced proof of concept, compared to a EA game like Prison Architect which has a lot of things to do inside it. The game has cool parkour, and interesting fighting mechanics but it's had that since 2011 and even with its interesting mechanics the game will keep you engaged for a couple hours and that's if you install mods.

								Stop reading the popular comments on this game never getting done, the devs have recently been employing more and more workers and the alphas are becoming more and more frequent. Exercise patience and buy on a Humble/Steam sale. Mid-late 2016.This game provides fun hand-to-hand, fury vs fury combat.  And that is something you want. A wonderful game in that it delivers exciting fights, whilst generating a sense of intesity, haste and timing. Satisfyingly dispatch foes with a judo toss, trade gashes in a knife fight, or break your neck from a poorly timed dodge roll, mid-jump.			",136,13,0,9,11,0,24

								I don't know if this guy was going with a Furry Fandom when he though about this but I must say I love the fact i'm not a human when I go around kicking a$$ in it, and then getting my a$$ kicked by other rabbit/wolf/cat/dog/robot Wahey, but it's pretty damn fun.PROS:Combat System: I popped into this game not knowing what to expect, and then my face hit the floor and I realized I had some work to do.  This is a combat system like no other, this isn't Button Mashing 101, you actually don't swing when you hit LMB, you have to get up close and hit it, and with each directional button you hit when you swing you do different things, like a roundhouse kick, a jab, hook, roll away, etc.  So if you go into this game expecting to mash buttons and win, you are gonna be on the floor with your neck broken fairly quickly.No humans, just animals: There are no humans in this game, just anthro bunnies/wolfs/cats/robots/dogs, which is a different change, and probably a huge A+ when it comes to the Furry community, which I am part of.  But I really like the fact it isn't just ""Another human"" this guy is actually putting something different in place of what a character usually is, and I like it.Classes: There are other classes, as I said the wolf, cat, etc.  The wolf is basically a one hit kill for the bunnies, as for the others I haven't tried yet, I like the Rabbit too much.The Ninjas: Every class is apparently a Ninja, I guess that would make sense since they wallrun, hop REALLY HIGH, with the amazing fighting skills and the ability to throw a spear/sword at a opponent and get a 1 hit kill off of it.No stamina/health bar: I like this honestly, you just kind of have to guess if you are about to die or not, since they don't bother you with a little health bar, plus you don't really have little stamina, as far as I know you have infinite, but you kind of have to watch how much blood you lose, especially when it comes to weaopnsWeapons: There are weapons in this game, and I really love them, despite the fact you can 1 hit kill if you throw it at them from behind or throw a spear at the opponents head, I got into some really heated sword battles that lasted several minutes or longer, and damn they were really fun too.Feel like a total bada$$: The title speaks for itself, when you start rolling around punching, roundhousing, jump kicking, and slicing everyone up I felt like the Master of weapons untill I got constantly kicked while rolling, but it was nice while it lasted.Wounds: If you get wounded by a weapon he actually holds near the wound with a hand if he has a open hand, I just think it's a neat little feature to notice that you are injured, like the ammount of blood pouring out of you wasn't enough already.Different maps + Arena: I love the Arena even though on ocassions I get totally screwed over with how laggy it can get in that stupid arena on slight ocassions, but there is different maps to run around with and explore, with enemies you can fight so you can do something.Responsive controls: I feel as if when I hit something it actually DOES what I want, instead of me hitting a button and it just kind of does whatever it's supposed to, problem though is with some weapon fighting the Roll doesn't really want to work on ocassions, and I don't know why.Challenges: There are many challenges to do and they are pretty fun, I only did a few like kill a few enemies with just your fists, I'll have to try the rest later on.Different skins/clothes: Each animal has different clothes, mainly the Bunny though, like there is a Assassin like outfit if you hit the ""1"" key a few times it changes his color, clothes, and clothes color, so you can be the one you want.CONS:REALLY long loading times: Half the time the levels take FOREVER to load, yet I get around 300 frames, I don't think it should take several minutes to load up a level that I've played several times over and still take me 5 minutes to load up.Constantly kicked: As I said in the pros I'll explain abit more, I was playing on a Dune level and I found a rabbit to fight, he kicked me down, I rolled, he kicked me WHILE I was rolling and then I snapped my neck, then when I tried to go back and kick the s%*t out of him he did it AGAIN.  I think the roll needs to be a little bit tweaked, maybe when you roll you can't get hit untill the moment he starts getting up or something? That way you get some time to get up and get your thoughts together, as well as be able to fight back.Jumping Physics: These are really weird, I was jumping around and had to jump back to where a enemy was cause I jumped away, he litterally did a 0.1 milisecond turn and had a s@%t ton of momentum and jumped all the way back, which kind of struck me as off, it's also weird to jump around a enemy cause you can't really turn all that well which feels kind of weird.  It doesn't help that when you land on a slope he instantly turns to go down the slope and moves down, so if i'm on a small ledge and jump and land, i'm most likely gonna fall off.Not much after a while: After you do the maps and arena a few times there isn't a whole lot left, there are challenges but even then it feels like it needs something, I say a Randomly generated map or something, just click a button, it randomizes a map and enemies with terrain and you go around exploring it to see what you can find.WHAT I THINK:I think this game is really fun and can have a lot of potential, and I feel confident it's gonna go somewhere in this guy's hands, he's already shown a lot of potential with just the combat system and the way it feels to roll around and fight instead of just another game where you press buttons and hope to win.  The game gets a 7/10 It needs some work and some additions but it's pretty f$#%ing good for what ""I"" was expecting out of it.			",377,41,2,15,16,2,13

								I can applaud Wolfire's ambition, and I appreciate that they bundle Receiver---which is a wonderful little bite-sized FPS---with Overgrowth, but that doesn't do much to offset two very key facts:-Overgrowth is still in alpha, and a buggy alpha at that.-It has been in alpha since 2008. SIX WHOLE YEARS.I realize Wolfire is a very small studio, but thirty dollars for a buggy alpha is an extremely bad deal. They're at least transparent that it's an alpha, but I bought the game years ago before it was Greenlighted on Steam never even imagining that they would take this ridiculously long.If you want to give Wolfire your money, go ahead. But keep in mind that this is nowhere NEAR a complete game---it's basically only a level editor/modkit and some assets at this point---and it's not clear when, if ever, a beta and/or a complete game will be forthcoming.I recommend just buying Receiver instead. It's finished, it's cheap, it's interesting, and overall not only is it more bang for your buck but it still supports Wolfire.If Wolfire learns some better time management skills and gets things moving, I may rewrite this review after sampling new features and content. Until then, this is a bad deal, and an example of the shortcomings of both Steam Greenlight and, to a greater extent, the whole concept of 'early access' in game sales.EDIT: Before anyone gets snarky, I bought this game through Wolfire's website some time before it ever came to Steam. Also, I play games on a laptop, so sometimes I play games more than the time played record indicates. Now if you're going to make sarcastic comments at me, at least say something productive instead of trying to punch holes in my review, especially given that I at least tried to be fair.

								For the longest time, Broforce was my most played PC indie, but I think it's safe to say Overgrowth has supplanted that as my go-to game. Now Overgrowth isn't complete by a long shot. It's still lacking a real campaign or story and the available content consists of a few challenges, several maps ranging from parkour-friendly courses to open areas with enemies to an arena. There's a robust level editor and a growing library of user content.But that's not what makes Overgrowth so fun, so addicting, and challenging. In my opinion, gameplay itself is paramount to making or breaking a game, and Overgrowth delivers in spades. The combat is up there with Arkham Asylum as my favorite fighting system in a game, simple to control yet complex in its execution and endlessly satisfying to watch. From agile evasion to smooth judo counters to tense knife fights or rolling under a swinging blade and digging a spear into an enemy's chest, the combat is just glorious funThe movement alone offers some of the best 3D platforming I've played since Prince of Persia in 2003. You're fast and insanely maneuverable, able to jump huge distances, wall run with ease, bounce between walls and roll under obstacles. Speed running through the community parkour maps is so entertaining.But Overgrowth isn't just great in its execution, but as a whole package inside and out. The anthropomorphic animal warriors and the semi-realistic atmosphere bring to mind classics like Redwall and Watership Down, and the brutality only cements those associations. A fight isn't just a simple exchange of blows; blades and hard hits leave bloody wounds across the body, blood that drips and stains in physics-accurate patterns. Fatal impacts against hard surfaces are accompanied by crunching bone. A stealthy neck slice sends arterial spray everywhere. A tough fight leaves you bloody and battered. Dodge at the wrong time and a kick will impact your head with a tangible sense of weight and momentum. It's these aspects that make the game such an enjoyable experienceBut there's more to come, from the proper integration of species like dogs, rats, and cats, and a full story. The backstory of the world has already been fleshed out in Lugaru and this fascinating digital comic (http://www.wolfire.com/comic#1) and if the game's story is as engrossing as the stories in those pages, Overgrowth could truly be the Redwall of gaming.

								Really, really want to like this project. I want to say it has a bright future. The physics, the combat, the game engine itself, the platforming, are all *very* promising.  Unfortunately, in it's current state it simply (to me) not worth the backing cost at all. Lately I've looked at my library, and I'm glad to say that out of all my titles, I regret very few purchases. Unfortunately, Overgrowth is a backing that for me is starting to look worthy of seeking a refund for. The speed of updates, the years it's been in development, and the.. state of the game/engine itself, (which grants me a low frame rate and crashes regardless of my settings, [important to note, I can run and enjoy GTAV and BF4 on this machine] even now), bring the centrally poised thumb downward. I won't say don't support them. And I am not yet decided on whether I would seek a refund with Wolfire Games.  I believe they are honest and don't spend the funds they receive wrongly necessarily, but I also can't say I think this price is worth what is offered. If this game does come to fruition within the next 1-2 decades, I'm sure it would be a great game, with a great engine, physics, combat based on said physics, and maybe an interesting story and (possibly?) multiplayer. As of now, you are putting your faith, and money, into a product which, (for some reason I personally cannot run very well at all), is ultimately far from finished and contains very little replay value in my view.  That said, when/if this title is *ever* finished or near finished, I imagine it would certainly be worth this price, if not more.			",82,4,0,6,5,0,7

								I've had this game purchased since it basically came out on steam. At the time, it was exciting and looked great. But as of now, it's easily forgotten about. The reason for that is the main feature of this project is its combat. Granted the fighting is still pretty nice, but once there's been next to no progress almost 3 years now (on steam alone). If there were more updates and some actual hope that the project would be done, I'd recommend hands down, but as of now, it's been in ""development"" for years. If you want to spend $30 for what is essentially a brawl combat simulator, then go right ahead. I just can't recommend a game with developers that haven't made much progress in this many years.

								I have much more hours on the SUMlauncher version, so Ignore my current hoursOvergrowth is an amazing game with creativity pumped into its veins. I've been following this game for a while now, And you get updates every 2-3 months, which from a group of 4? I believe is pretty impressive. Some people believe that this game will be stuck in alpha forever, But I decided to hang on, because of the moddability using the SUMlauncher version.Animations are very clean smooth and rarely are sluggish, but you can find some glitches here and there, But it's an alpha game.The game itself visually looks stunning, if you have a computer that's able to withstand it.9/10 Would kick furries again <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								By all means, BUY THIS. It's alpha is better than many full games out there. While it's true that it still doesn't have a story mode or anything besides just killing and brawling, it has one of the most tight, satisfying fighting mechanics I've ever seen. I remember the first time I played and I was like "" OH DAMN "" when I kicked a Rabit in the face and he flew miles. If you like very fast paced games, brutal hand-to-hand and weapon combat, or just very intresting indie games, definetely buy this. One of my favorite games of all time even before it's out, made by a very small team ( 2 or 3 guys I think ).PS : Just a small plus, it also has AMAZING ragdoll physics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If smacking someone in the face with a machinegun of some sort doesn't do it for you in games, then this is the game for you!  It's not a game where you click and the game plays a hit animation for whatever you clicked.  In this game, your character basically becomes a physics object and the force will actually transfer to your opponent ( e.g. if you roundhouse someone, they will go FLYING in the opposite direction (unless they blocked, in which case, awww too bad)).Oh, there's also parkour.And mods.And maps.And a forum.and a community-created mod browser.Ok go buy it now.P.S.  It isn't a furry game,  nor is Lugaru.  Apparently, David thought it would be too brutal on humans and with rabbits, the jumps and what not are more realistic.  And the combat is pretty brutal.Oh, and there's instakilling wolves.  And weapons.Ok seriously now go buy this game.			",66,4,0,2,8,0,1

								This awesome game is about rabbits brutally stabbing each other to death with various weapons and/or beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of each other with their bare hands. The combat system is probably the most intense and fast paced I've ever seen. This game also has some of my favorite fighting mechanics in any fighting game, ever. The rabbits and other animals move blindingly fast, and attack unrelentingly, with each single move possibly ending in death. If Tony Jaa was a rabbit he would be in this game. It's like my dream Redwall game but totally not for kids(although those books were pretty damn violent). The graphics are aesthetically pleasing, but the really impressive part is the near perfect animation of the characters. They move so freakin'  fast that it's hard to appreciate all the work that's gone into animating these animals, but when viewed in slow motion (available at any time by pressing tab) you'll see each character inflict gruesome wounds on each other and block/ dodge in a convincing dance of death. When you see detailed blood streams running down your rabbit avatar's face and dripping onto the cold snow after a gruesome fight you'll see what I mean.I played the alpha for this a bit prior to the steam release and while there's not really anything concrete to do yet I'm super excited to see where this goes. There's plenty of user created maps and stuff to mess around in too. Unfortunately the game kind of comes off as an early tech demo but so far the combat and parkour elements are super fun by themselves. This game is a sequel to Lugaru HD, which came out quite a long time ago but featured the same peculiar rabbit on rabbit combat. The creator is Wolfire Games, who were responsible for organizing the first Humble Bundle. They deserve your money just for creating such an amazingly affordable method of pc game distribution while giving so much to charity!You should probably get this if you have any interest in a brutal fast paced fighting game. Any game which lets you run up the side of the wall, do a backflip, and slam your giant rabbit feet into someone's face is certainly worth a look.			",710,163,17,69,63,8,96

								in my opinion this game is not worth the money certainly not the £22 asking price. This game in the 2 years i have owned it has had very little meaningful aditions to it ,through out the 2 years i have had it there has only been a extra game mode ,that is a arena mode which has only one map for it and has you fighting against a certain amount of opponents each round which gets boring fast and some editor additions which allows you to construct your own maps which would be great if it was a little easier to use and really i am struggling to find more things that have been added because updates are few and far between and have very little meaningful additions to a average player i mean at one point i forgot about it for a long time and i was looking throught my game library and came across this again and thought to my self ""hey i should have a look at this i havent played it in a while so surely there will be some new featuer that i could have some fun with "" well boy was i shocked to find that when i started the game up there was literally nothing that i could see without going onto the fourms to find out what had been added well in the fourms i found that all that had been added were some bug fixes and some animation changes to the characters which by the way were not large changes at all.but to wrap up my review, dont buy this game it has been in development for 7 years and this game is still feel naked there is alot of things missing from this game and quite honestly i dont think this game is ever going to be finished see how little substance there is to this game after 7 years. My recommendations are that if you are going to buy a game dont buy this one find a game that is either complete or is in early access and looks alot more promising and actaully has a update shedule and adds new content on a regualr basis the games that you can get for £22 are alot better than this game . Stay away from this game until the unlikely case that this game actually get finished			",131,22,29,8,21,1,13

								I have to admit, my hopes were set way too high when I bought this game. I assumed that it was going to have open worlds with differently dispersed enemies and weapons, as well as open-world style gameplay. When I got in-game, I found the Start menu to be extremely simplistic, which, in my opinion, is a good way to navigate easily. As I entered Campaign mode, I was thrown off by not one campaign with open-world gameplay, but 3, with set objectives for each. After discovering that I could not play 2 of the campaigns, I chose Gladiator, which forces you to fight for an infinite amount of time with infinite amounts of matches. Once in-game, I found it to be extremely buggy, with simple combat controls (LMB is the only way to attack). The graphics were alright, however, I found it annoying that the most common attack is a kick. Soon, the controls made more sense. I discovered how to duck and roll around like a wheel. Countering was difficult, but fun. The enemies were ridiculously difficult to defeat, but I got a 'kick' out of the ragdoll of their bodies and cheapshotting the other rabbits by throwing spears at them as soon as the match starts. Eventually, I found that you could revive all rabbits, including yourself, by simply hitting X. I used this to stay in the matches, even after I had died. Soon came the 'Lightning Key', as I called it, which allows your rabbit to send out a lightning bolt from his chest, instantly killing all other rabbits. I used this to get my skillset up to well over 2000. I had over 4 quadrillion fans, and my rabbit's apparel was completely black. The enemies were bugged by this point, being larger than the building itself, and simply put, a large mass of glitched black. They were impossible to defeat, and could kick me infinite distances. I crashed the game 4 times before I gave up this cheating lifestyle and moved on to beat all of the challenge missions, which, surprisingly, were ridiculously easy. This whole review may seem like I'm bashing on this game, but that is not the case.I had a lot of fun with this game. I got Receiver with it, which I still actively play. I waited ever since I got Steam to get this game, so it was a relief when I finally played it for the first time. The countless bugs and glitches make this game awfully fun, and I think it has quite a bit of potential, once it actually gets out of Alpha. 10/10			",85,10,0,4,11,0,1

								I waited years to get this game. I watched every video iDubbbz made about this game and I fell in love. I read the comics, I followed the lore, and I was a fanatic. After a few years of wanting to buy it, I finally caved in and coughed over the $30 that the devs simply refuse to lower.There's barely anything to it. A few flat environments with random rocks everywhere, a couple enemies here and there, and that's all. Also an editing mode that crashes every time you try to use it. If it was free (as it should be) I wouldn't have any complaints. But this game has been in development since 2008. Every single update they've made is just ""bug fixes"" but I've seen more bugs in my few hours of playing than any other game I have ever played. It crashed every single time I played it. I don't think I ever legitimately exited the game. I fell through the ground, walls, you name it. The game simply does not work. It's a buggy, lackluster, empty, forgotten mess.One of the two things this game had going for it was the combat, which is a nightmare to work with a keyboard. Sometimes you die in a single punch, other times you can fall off a cliff and get stabbed without dying. It's a interesting system when it works, but it's an ungodly amount of hard when the computer blocks everything you do and sees your movements before you can even make them. When it worked, I definitely had fun. But navigation with an active, fast-paced combat system on a keyboard just doesn't work.The other thing this game had going for it was the modding community, which has been dead for a year. I can barely get any of the mods to function correctly. When they do, it's only a matter of time before the game crashes.I really wanted to like this game, but the fact that the developers can charge $30 for an unfinished, neglected mess of a ""game"" is an insult. If they want this to work, make it a free demo, support the modding community, and add a story mode. Or they could add an adventure mode with missions on the (empty) maps. Or they could add anything that offers real value.I hate this game so much I left a review a few hours after buying it. I *really* wanted to like it, but the negatives far outweighed the positives. Don't buy this. Especially not for $30. At this point, it's not worth any price tag. It's a joke, and the developers just don't care.			",113,38,1,23,18,0,8

								Overgrowth is an amazing game as it stands. Even as a game just getting off the ground it shows features many triple A titles seem to leave out. The AI is better than most, the physics and damage system is revolutionary, and above all it is a truly fun and enjoyable game ! When it comes to gameplay there are a few quirks, bugs can appear from time to time, and preformance is fairly limited even on beastly Pc's. But these are things we can expect from a game still in Beta. And besides that the gameplay is outstanding both un-armed and armed combat is a blast and doesnt take too long to get used to. From massive AI battles to one on one areana matches you cant stop having fun with this game. In my opinion if your looking for a fun fighting based game its a must have if not its still something you should either buy or keep your eye on this game keeps on showing a lot of potential.

Yet anothher excellent example of why we should not buy into early access♥♥♥♥♥♥			",105,12,4,12,13,2,6

Early Access Review
								I don't have the energy at the moment to write a well written, informative review. BUT. Seeing as they've announced that they've reached ""Beta"" I thought I should at least input my opinion. This game is not worth $30. This game is not worth $20. Do not buy this game in its current state. It's just not worth the money. It's fun, definitely, but with the outrageous pricetag Wolfire has placed on the game it's just not worth investing in. They have been in development for so many years now and only recently have they begun making ground. Even the sale that's on now is still not good enough to justify getting this game. You may be confused seeing as I've recommended it, but this isn't a review saying it's a bad game. It's just letting people know they'll feel ripped off if they aren't truly passionate about a game such as Overgrowth or were fans of Lugaru. The fighting mechanics are incredible and the level designer is just as good. Hopefully this game will get much, MUCH better once it has a story. Don't lose faith in the game but only get it if you really want to support the developers and/or it's on a much bigger sale. TL;DR The game is fun, no doubt, but 30 bucks is way too expensive for this game. Get it on a big sale or if you really want to support the developers, not if you're looking for an indie game filled with content.EDIT: I may edit this review to appease those who want more information but for now check comments for more on how I see the state of the game and why I ""reviewed"" it as such.

								Got this game back in 2011 before it was on steam(played a few hours).  If you look at the developers news feed(referring to todays date), from page 5 to 4 he had an update in 2010 and then took a break for 3-4 years and had an update in 2014(before 2010, he was fairly consistent).  I'm starting to get suspicious about this guys intentions on finishing and I feel like he is giving early access a bad name considering the high price and the very slow development ~8 years total.At least with other early access games, they are actively engaged with the community and letting you know the leaps and bounds they are going through while also communicating grand ideas and producing them.  Not taking 4 year breaks between development even though tons of people backed this guy early on.			",115,5,1,13,12,0,32

								This is the game/Early Access version of an old car your Uncle has up on blocks and is ""restoring"". Every 6 months, he might change out a couple of plugs/belts and maybe once every two years he'll put a bumper or something on it, but everyone knows it's not gonna leave the driveway under its own power. The *difference* is your Uncle isn't charging people $30 shares to ride it.While, technically, they do update occasionally- meaningful development has long long since stopped happening.  This is the hobby project of a dev who tinkers around the edges every so often and never quite manages to finish this thing. Don't bother wasting your money. And hey, maybe the lead dev will get a divorce and suddenly decide to work through his depression by finishing that ca- oh uh, I mean game. Steam really, really, needs some standards on how long EA status can last before it gets reviewed or- even better- refunds open up for *everyone* who bought it. You can't finish development in less than 4,5,whatever years on EA? Well, fine, give the community an option to essentially end your development by all claiming refunds (which, yeah Steam would end up paying many of them out itself... hey, it'd give Steam some incentive to vet these things too). Good projects could clear that bar- bad ones couldn't. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game had great potential, however there have been no game updates for months, and the 'weekly Q&A' stopped about eight (8) weeks ago.Another sad case of dreaming too big :cCombat is reasonably solid, and the graphics are pretty good.There aren't many glitches outside of being stuck when knocked to the floor.There is no campagin! The only fun element has been Arena, which becomes tiring after a while of fighting for the sake of fighting.In short: If you are reading this in 2016, and it hasn't been released, DO NOT BUY!I'm classifiyng this as abandonded due to the developer's inability to keep to thier own schedule.

								Do not buy this game until it is out of early access, the last update was in February. So far this isn't a game, it's an engine that starts up and throws you into a couple of locations in which you can fight against some AI. There is a map editor that you can play around with if you really want to, other than that it's dead in the water. The devs still reply to questions on the website every week or so, but all the replies are a lot of ""Oh the game is getting larger"" and ""We don't know when it will be released, but we're hoping for an increase of gameplay and modding support"". I wasted 30 bucks on this ""game"" take my advice wait until it's actually a game and not just a bunch of guys talking about what it could be and actually making it something.

								Okay , this game mechanics are amazing first of all.If you do a flip and land on your head you will die.This game became great after steam release , there is a new map , new tutorial , well , mission tutorial , the wolf team are greatGame mechanics and don't focus on any story line and stuff.I played this game before steam release and it was really bad , the game optimization was really bad and today the game became great and the optimization and dramatic bugs were fixed.If you would like to support the game developers and get new stuff to this game it'll worth it.If they will add cooperative or multiplayer it'll be awesome with game mods like Capture the flag / man of the hill / last standing or even team deathmatch.(13/3/2014 , 10:09 AM review)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you want to pay thirty dollars for incredible gameplay that will become boring after a few minutes (after loading for six hours), buy this game.

								Development for this game has been functionally dead for years, and shows no signs of speeding up. The regular updates that showed actual progress are long gone. Dev's seem to have just put up the minimal of work they can to seem active, even though almost nothing has changed in the game in years.With that in mind: The mechanics in the game alone almost make it worth buying. Even with the terrible development it has recieved, the base idea and combat works so well that it still is enjoyable. A game that has so much wasted potential. Not to mention the terrible ui and overall glitchyness. (Sometimes assests don't load, occasionally hiccup in combat, however most glitches do not affect the gameplay). JUST KNOW:  If you buy this game do not expect it to be developed much, if at all. Dead dev team. If that does not bother you, and the content currently available is worth your money, then go for it.			",76,6,2,7,12,2,10

								So I paid lots of money for a game I could never play after all. Do I get my money back?When I bought the early access version it was super slow and laggy so I thought, it's still in development, just give it time. It looked like a very promising game. Several years later, we're still in alpha and now it's so laggy it's even slow for a slideshow. I have never been able to play this ♥♥♥♥ing game. Yes I don't have top game gear, but neither does every single player on Steam. This is worse than Duke Nukem Forever – at least they delivered a game after like 10 years, even if it sucked.

Early Access Review
								God damnit!I really wanted to give this game a good review but the updates are far too slow to be released and even worse is that the updates are just some patches. There hasn't been major changes or even new content in two years.But lets go back to my history with the game,Back in the day (two years ago) the game was on a website, updates would come out once every week or so and new content was added some of those weeks, then roughly a year later the game gets released on steam. Yay! The people who bought the game on the website got a code for the new steam release. After the game gets released on steam people expected a major inprovement on the engine? maybe the graphics? oh and what about the combat? but nope, it was just another version of the game on steam. updates still kept coming out every week but all the updates about new content had and still have stopped and updates felt more like crappy patches than anything, the game kept crashing for no reason and I would be able to understand this because it's Early Access, and we all know that Early Access games arn't going to be bug free, but if the game keeps crashing for two years and the developer hasn't did anything about it? I really can't understand that. even if the developer would have released an update every three days it would still feel cheap. So that's why im giving this game a negitive review, it was such a shame as I like the idea of a third person parkour, action game, the parkour even felt amazing when you mastered it and the combat was amazing yet brutal. But sadly there's just too many flaws with the game for me to justify thats it is worth £23.99.			",232,21,0,14,22,2,17

Early Access Review
								This is a review of a game that has been in development for many years.  Since the game isn't complete, I'm going to give my impressions of the current state of gameplay.What it is:  A game of exploration and combat with anthropomorphic animals.  Exploration is done by using physics based ""parkour"" on objects in the environment.  Combat is also physics based using punches, kicks, blocks, jumps, rolls, and melee weapons (which can be thrown and even caught).  It's probably better to view one of the many videos out there than try to comprehend my explanation of it here.  Don't worry, there are no spoilers yet, since there is no main game campaign as of the time I write this.The initial Steam install contains some basic maps in which one can experience the gameplay.  There is a combat map where two people can fight matches on the same computer using keyboard/mouse and a controller.  While the mouse has an invert look option in the setup menu, the controller does not.  Another level is a simple arena where one can fight endless battles against the AI.  The AI doesn't currently have all the move sets possible to the player, but it's still quite capable of killing me!  It's probably the best single player experience available for the game so far.  The remaining maps are basic environments, sometimes with a few enemies to be defeated.In addition to the basic installation, there are mods created by the community that are available for download and automatic installation via the Wolfire website and the SUMLauncher application, which is currently required for managing your game install.  Overgrowth can be launched directly from SUMLauncher or by Steam, but only launching through Steam allows access to the overlay and hours spent playing the game.The community mods are a mixed bag.  Some haven't been updated with the game and will likely crash.  Most of the others suffer from poor level design and bad optimization.  Still, despite my personal criticisms, I have to say that the game seems wide open for modders to express their creativity and hone their skills.  It's a tinkerer's paradise, to be sure!Should you buy it?  If you want a polished and finished gaming experience, NO.  If you don't mind supporting a small developer who has built a framework for what could be a great adventure game in the future, then yes.  The potential is certainly there, and you could do worse.  As with any Early Access game, only buy it if you are willing to take the risk that what you buy is all you'll ever get.  Recommended, but with strong caution that you know what you're getting into.			",89,19,0,13,1,0,1

All of that and I've still not mentioned the price tag, 27,99 euros. That is insane, I can't believe the developers feel that it's justified, it should be 5 euros max.

I orignially thought this was going to turn out to be something great but instead it has turned out that help finance the creation of a game engine.

								Having preordered long before steam keys were released, I have more time in the game than steam says.Despite it's long time in alpha (yes, steam calls it Early access, but keep in mind this game was pre-purchaseable long before steam had an early access system in place) I still am looking forward to the finished product. I have been following the video logs a long time and am always impressed with the technical achievements they showcase. There are simply no other combat brawling games like this. If you can pull it off, you can deliver blows that break bone, a slash with a blade will maim or kill your opponent realistically, the detail put into the animation that makes for a fluid visual spectacle. It's fast paced and you have to develop skills and quick reflexes but I have never played a more satisfying fighting game. ",154,20,1,32,10,0,1

								I remember seeing this game in development when I has in 4th grade. 4TH. I'm graduating highschool this year and they've added a whole whopping 2 major things in 8 years. The map editor, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse for a campaign. Honestly I wanted to give this game a chance but this is ridiculous, let alone the fact that they said they'd do monthly updates and its been about 2 months since the last one with nothing afterwards. Great idea, poorly executed.*Edit* I'll admit that the game has its perks, the fluid animations and the fun combat, but other than that its pretty empty right now unless you like making your own levels.

								When I bought this game I was still in high school. Wolfire Games were my heroes, I loved Lugaru.This game is not going to be finished. They spent years making their own software, performing redesign and redesign and redesign on characters, and still haven't actually given us single player content, or even finished the rest.I feel like I have been scammed. It's not like it was an expensive game, but when I bought it, it was a fair amount to me. I preordered it because I loved the idea, and this has soured everything to do with that.They've recently ""restarted"" development, but they still haven't come up with anything meaningful.If you're willing to just mod and play community stuff, it's worth a look. The game looks like♥♥♥♥♥ but that's what happens when you develop your own software to streamline development then don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥with it for ♥♥♥♥ing years.I personally feel cheated.

								It pains me to say this, but don't buy this game. Not for now, at least. It has a lot of potential, but if this year taught us anything, is that potential is very oftenly exploited, and the hype train just crashes as the developers stop building the rails after gaining enough money to buy a nice house and hire some top tier ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I can see these developers doing something like this, even though this ""game"" is quite a good shell of a shell of a game. I believe the developers realized that their ""game"" wasn't a game at all, and so they created the arena mode, which is enjoyable for a couple of hours before getting very dull and repetitive. This has been in development for almost a decade, and I don't see how the developers would be able to turn this into a game until at least 2020. The pricing is ridiculous for what you're getting, and there's no online multiplayer nor will there be one anytime soon, from what I can tell. I really enjoyed this for the first hours, but after I saw all the game could offer, I realized exactly what this was: a hollow ""game"" making hollow promises. The physics are very impressive, but I'm pretty sure that'll be obsolete before this is finished. This game isn't garbage, it's just not quite worth the risk, the wait or the price.

								This is game has so much potential, yet it is held back due to lacking development. I feel like Wolfire isn't putting enough time and care to get this game out of Early Access to the point where no one will be interested in it by the time Beta/the full game comes around. The price is too high, there is no multiplayer feature as of now via Steam, and you quickly run out of things to do in the Sandbox mode. I do NOT recommend buying this game anytime soon until (if ever) more features come out for it.			",74,4,0,11,9,3,8

								It's disappointing to see a potentially brilliant gem of a game dragged through eight years of painfully slow development, with no indications of release in the foreseeable future. The things did get a bit more lively at one point, what with additional developers and more frequent updates, but that, too, seems to have stopped some time ago. The engine is (or at least, used to be) a marvel of development and originality, with mechanics unseen even in AAA games. Seeing it in action made me want to support the game development, but as more years pass, it seems very much like a wasted investment. Sad thing is, Overgrowth taught me to be wary of supporting similar projects in the future and stick to purchasing released games only, since there is absolutely no guarantee of having a finished product in the end.

								Their speed makes it really hard to want to support them. Yes it takes a long time to make games, but plenty of companies have made multiple successful games in the time this game has spent in alpha. There's a lot of reasons/excuses I hear, they're a small team, maybe they just work on it in their spare time. $30 price tag too on top of it all. I got this game a very long time ago and I've not seen any substantial changes that warrant me to play again yet.I mean c'mon, can we consider that maybe these guys just aren't cut out to make games? 10 years in alpha? I'm not saying I could do better, but I'm also not claiming to be a game developer.			",526,78,4,57,23,2,43

								The basis for a fantastic game is clearly being laid down in Overgrowth. The combat is fun and fluid, the animations and physics are much smoother than many fully released games. It seems very innovative, as well. It's very raw at the moment, however, as expected from a game in this early of stages. Overall, I think it has extreme potential.			",78,3,2,11,5,0,14

								TLDR; Ninja rabbit game involing beating each other up after just pakouring like an assassin in a sandbox world (For now)Overgrowth, A currently in-Alpha Sandbox,Level-editor,Brawler and Parkour game, where the enviroment is your most effective weapon and the factor that usually determines your survival. (And no I don't mean that the Earth just engulfs your enemies when you're about to die) The fighting is fast paced and based on a sort of skeletal structure, which means if you get hard enough, somethings going to break. IE. Throwing someone over your shoulder and it just so happens they land on their neck and it kills them, or you boot some poor soul hard enough you send him flying into a wall to have his spine broken and then he is paralyzed and no longer a problem.The parkour, from what I've seen and is very fast paced, wall jumping, wall running, leaping great distances, this allows people to make very interesting and huge maps that require you to be a skilled ninja rabbit (Unlike me because I usually make my rabbits 8 feet tall and obese, so I can use that as an excuse as to why I can't parkour to even save my life) to succeed in such levels.Speaking of creating very intense parkour levels and such, The Level editor is great for allowing you to, as I stated above to create interesting and unique levels whether it be a large scale battle with swords and spears or an intense ninja parkour challenge, or both, you are able to create it, and if you are too lazy to build an interesting map or the base game materials aren't enough for you, theres a program created for modding the game known as the SUMLauncher(Supported by the Devs themselves) which instantly downloads and places the files in the correct areas so you can use them with no hassle of moving the files yourself, this program has lots of user created mods that range from maps to characters to props.However the game is still in Alpha and if you're not the person to purhase early and follow a games progress untill its finished then perhaps wait until the game is finished as it is very worth it already in its current state, and I recommend getting it early and watching it grow and develop.

Hitting ESC turns your fighter into an AI while you go into an unorganized spawning menu and it's just a big mess. It's been in Alpha for as long as I remember, but it just barely makes progress. It is nowhere near done and I honestly don't think it ever will be done. Good game, but all the problems with it outweigh the fun.			",55,10,0,9,4,0,4

								This game is solid for an early access. The title has earned a special place in our scam list, and most would agree that the number of devs that abuse the system are enormous. However, after a long period of stagnant development, the devs have come back, and fequent updates seem to have come back.Is the price of 30USD waaay too much? Yes. At it's current stage of development, I'd say 10-15 is a much, much better price. I'd recommend waiting until it's on sale for at least 50% off. That way, you don't feel like you're risking too much on a game that, as always, could just stop being updated forever. It's more of an arcade game at the moment. It's fun to play occationally, messing around with the weapons and parkour mechanics. Get it at a good price, and you shouldn't feel ripped off. Summer sales, ho!			",61,7,1,11,20,0,19

								They just added the campaign (a million years later!), so I feel it's finally time to give it a review. Let's get straight to business.PROS:+ Fantastic combat. I never really like fighting games because it's all memorizing move sets and weird terminology (I'm talking stuff like SB:Melee fanboys who gush about Wave Flipping Grab Dash Jumpity-Skidoo Slam: Electric Boogaloo moves). This game has no combos to remember, it's all dynamicly done. It's super hard to explain how the combat works, I suppose just watching any video will explain it better than I can. It's faster and reflexes are the most important thing. Defeating your opponent without taking a single scratch is the most satisfying thing ever.+ As a continuation of above, the health is also fantastic. Instead of health bars, it's all based on a blood and bone structure. You can literally snap your own neck by rolling before you hit the ground. Hit an enemy in the head and you'll probably kill them (and also launch them against a wall in the process). Blood drips off your character. When you slash someone, there's an actual slash mark where you hit them. Enemies clutch their wounds when they are low on health. It's brutal.+ Parkour. You run fast, jump far, and can climb and wall jump. It's certainly not Mirror's Edge -- I mean, it's not meant to be, this is a fighting game -- but it's still great fun to bound across the landscape and then leap into a kick that smashes someone's face.+Speaking of landscapes, with the exceptions of the arena maps (for obvious reasons), the maps are expansive and look great. Even if the story missions take place in possible one tenth of the map area, it gives you not only a great vista to look at, but also a wide area to sneak about and scout out the area. The maps you can use for the editor are varied fairly nicely. They're not going to knock your socks off, but they're still interesting and have lots of verticality for running and jumping.+ The graphics are good. Even on lowest settings, it's not hideous. On high it looks pretty damn good. + The arena mode is a good time waster. I feel like that's the wrong word for it (sounds too negative), but what I mean is that it's fun to boot up the game every so often and whack some rabbit butt for an hour or two. There are a couple of arenas to choose from, plus a local versus mode. It's a good time waster in the sense that it takes a while for you to get bored, and even when you do get bored, you don't feel disappointed.+ You can literally kick someone in midair and launch yourself into the air (and launch your opponent's floppy and now unconscious body into the dirt). Hard to pull off but god are they satisfying... until you launch yourself into a wall and break your neck.+ Comes with a free copy of Reciever and Low Light Combat. I haven't played the latter, but I can tell you now that the former is a wonderful freebie to get. It definitely alleviates the high price tag of this game, especially if you like shooters with the difficulty of Dark Souls. No, I'm not exaggerating.EH~ I can't really talk about FPS stuff with much authority because my computer is getting on in years -- though I might be getting new parts for my PC soon. If I do, I'll definitely boot the game up again and put it on highest settings to see how it fares (and edit my review). I will say that the FPS takes a hit the more NPCs (in combat mode) there are on a screen. One mission has around 6 enemies walking about, and I had 60 FPS. Once I aggro'd them all, it dipped to about 50. The Arena and Story don't throw tons of enemies at you, but if you're planning on using the editor to plonk down more than, say, 15 enemies, be prepared for an FPS hit once combat starts.~ The story is a port of Lugaru (the game that this studio made before this). If you've played Lugaru and liked it, you'll definitely get some nostalgia feels. Seeing the story in new graphics is great. However, it comes with many of the downsides as well. There's many loading screens -- some levels are literally just 2 minutes long with some dialogue, and then it loads the next level. The story is still just as barely passable as it was 10-ish years ago. Basically, you're gonna play the story just for the challenge rather than anything else. I finished the campaign in about 2 1/2 hours.~ The story ends on a cliffhanger now (unlike Lugaru), which makes me think there's a ""part 2"" of the campaign in the works. It took a damn long time for them to make the campaign, which makes me wonder how long it'll take to continue it. Granted, it'll probably be faster since the devs have their footing now, but still.~ Combat with weapons doesn't feel right. It's not terrible, but it needs work. Unlike hand-to-hand combat, which feels tactical and tense, weapon combat just feels like you're wailing away at an enemy until they fall over, which generally takes about 5 seconds since every weapon except the dagger is essentially an instant kill.~ There is stealth, but it's not the best. What makes it unfortunate is that some story missions essentially require it so that you don't take on 5 enemies at once, but it can be trial-and-error. Better than nothing I guess.~ It's early access, so there are still bugs and grahpical glitches. None of them so far were game- or immersion-breaking, but they're still a bit annoying to see.~ The editor is hit-and-miss. It doesn't explain much, and while it's not that difficult to use once you look up a tutorial or two, it's still a bit slow and you'll have to put a lot of effort into your map in order for it to be anything more than just a silly little battle you slapped together.~ Wolves can only be damaged by weapons and jump kicks. I can sorta see why, but still. Eh.CONS- No online multiplayer. Hopefully it will come. I doubt it, because this game requires split-second reactions, which are hampered by internet.- Speaking of ""latency"", there are MANY frustrating times where blocking wouldn't work, especially during the campaign. This new update did change the combat in a lot of ways, and I'm hoping it didn't affect the reaction time of your character. Sometimes I'd be blocking perfectly and he'd still stand there like a bucket of jell-o. Before, I could fight my way through two-on-one battles easily; now a one-on-one can be a hit-or-miss. Strangely enough, it only seems to rear its ugly head once weapons are in the mix. Hand-to-hand combt is (largely) still the same.- Quarterstaves. Oh my god. Oh. My. GOD. At the risk of sounding like ""volvo plz nerf"", they really need to be taken down a notch. When I'm fighting an enemy with a staff, I literally cannot block them. At all. All I can do is try to do the jump-kick. Strangely enough, once I have the staff, it sucks. I think the combat AI for staff attacks is too powerful. Avoid at all costs.- It's been in development for like.... 8 years or something. There are times where an update comes out that's just ""new lighting"" and once every so often there's a massive content drop (such as now). Still, it's arduously slow. I don't have a huge problem with it, but for those of you who want something substantial, this can be a turn off.- The price is high. If it were half the price I'd 1000% reccomend this game even with all the bugs and stuff. As it stands, the price means you'll really have to want this game. If you like fighting games, try it.SUMMARYA fantastic fighting game featuring rabbits, wolves, cats and dogs, and even weird mice, finally with a rudimentary campaign, several great arena maps, and a level editor. While it looks great and runs quite well, it's a slow-to-update game that might not have enough content for most folks out there to warrant a 30-buck purchase. It's not the best game I have, but it's one of the most ambitious and interesting for sure. I recommend it.			",167,10,0,17,5,2,22

This is the best tech demo on Steam, but that's the problem.The GoodAs a tech demo, it is outstanding. There's an excellent sense of movement and weight to your character as they move, which makes the freerunning mechanics of game really shine. The combat is brutal, unforgiving and very fun. It's a simple left-click to attack and right-click to block, but add in the quick movement, sound and fantastic animation the combat is bliss. In it's current state there's also an arena mode that to allow you to only fight. It's very barebones, but it demonstrates the games excellent capabilities. The concept of ninja bunnies and other creatures like cats and dogs is great and I do look forward to how this idea will play out. The game is also easy to mod and has a solid creator tool for making your own environments and arenas. Did I mention the game has the best blood physics of any game I've ever seen?The BadFrom what I know Overgrowth has been in development for seven years and I've been playing it for two of those years. In all that time the game has changed very little. Since I got it in 2013, there have been a few new, but small features, new models, new items and a bevy of bug fixes. None of these however really changed the games experience or made it feel improved all that much. I understand some games take time to develop, but this is just silly given how much money you have to pay for the game. There's no campaign (yet) and there's very little voice acting aside from the occasional grunt and yell. The game also crashes, a lot. There's also a good deal of bugs, some even gamebreaking.SummaryIt hurts to see such a good idea and base game stagnate. It's a lot of fun, but paying that price for something with such a lack of things to do, I just can't condone buying it right now. I can condone waiting for it to improve, but we've been waiting a very long time already so don't get your hopes up. If you really like freerunning ninja bunnies who beat the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of each other and you're willing to pay the price, you'll have plenty of fun for a while. If you're like me, someone who expected more for what they payed, add it to your wishlist and wait until a sale or until the game reaches a more complete state.6.5/10 ",62,7,3,7,6,2,4

								Let me say that I go into this quick review with a bit of a bias... This has been my most anticipated game for the last 2 years.Finally being able to get my hands on a Steam release and even the alpha lives up to everything I had hoped for.Being a ninja rabbit (or the other animals featured in the game) is such fun. Much joy. Many gameplay. Wow. The parkour elements are incredibly fluid and fun to execute. The climbing, wall running, and jumping all feel so satisfying that you'll find yourself doing it over and over again even without a clear goal to do so.The combat system is fantastic. Technically very simple - very few buttons are used. The system however is incredibly deep and complex - very hard to master. All the characters, aside from being able to carry out loads of moves, can also pick up weapons to use in combat. Those can also be thrown (Which is a lot of fun)The one mode which convinced me this game has neverended potential is the versus mode. Although only one map is featured, and the mode is literally ""Player 1 tries to kill Player 2 while Player 2 tries to do kill Player 1"" when me and my sister played it for the first time we spent 40+ minutes on it, constantly having fun. There was always some new combat move to execute, there was always some discovery to do - turning on slow motion and throwing swords at each other and watch them bounce back and kill us in recoil, chasing each other whilst throwing combat knives, doing nothing but jump kicks, etc.The game at the current state also features some stealth elements, allowing you to sneak up on enemies and take them out silently rather than engaging in a fight.Best part? You can mod and change everything as you please.Want to make a map with 20 rabbits fighting to the death with dog bones on top of a giant mountain? You can.Want to make your own story map with characters, dialogue, jumping puzzles and combat? You can.Want to download mods and maps and new characters or try making your own? You can.I could go on for ages, but even for an alpha this game not only offers a lot of content, but provides something I really enjoy in games - The ability for the player to make their own content. To make their own world and fun, and I dont mean this in terms of the editor but in terms of gameplay. Hours can be spent on creating characters with various weaponry and then fighting them on maps you designed, Wolfire designed, or the community designed, OR hours can be spent doing parkour and slow motion flips as a ninja rabbit.If this doesn't convince you to buy this game - I dont know what will.Totally worth the 30 bucks and I cant wait for more and more and more content to be continouly added such as the campaigns, more arenas, more versus maps (although you can already play Split Screen on any map downloaded) and of course the online multiplayer.Already a candidate for game of the year.

								Overgrowth is ambitious. In fact, I've never seen another openworld game quite like it. In it's present state, this game has tremendous potential and requires community support to see that potential realized. I feel that many Steam users have been spoiled by more polished alpha state games and expect the same from Overgrowth. This title is a reminder of what an EARLY ACCESS game really is. Developers bring their games to Steam in Early Access looking for community support to shape the game into something they want to play. This game is perfect for that concept. At the time of this review (update 206), Wolfire is focusing on the campaign mode for the game. However, there is plenty of room for change while the game remains in alpha. I highly recommend this game to anyone who finds it appealing. Everything this game has to offer is out in the open and plain to see. You are getting an openworld close quarters combat simulator. The physics are impressive, and the character models are a welcome break from the staples in the fantasy genre. If you are expecting a polished, complete game, stop looking at early access titles. Only get this game if you are willing to support Wolfire and see this game reach completion.			",329,48,0,49,11,0,15

								There are some good things about Overgrowth, like it's exceptional combat system and the brutal feeling of how quickly the fights end. However, I can't recommend a game that, after this long of a development time, is still very unfinished. There are many flaws in the game that have been in the game for a long time, yet have not been fixed. For example, each fight lasts a few seconds. This wouldn't be a problem, but after you die you have to sit through an animation that brings up the ""try again"" button, click it with a cursor that is a purple missing texture symbol, run all the way back to the fight and die after two seconds and do it all over again. It may sound like I'm nit-picking, but this becomes frustrating after a very short period of time. Let's look at the other part of the game, the arena. Here there is the exact opposite problem, where there is not enough of a waiting time between matches. Multiple times I have been killed before I even knew the next match was happening. Sometimes it is literally impossible to get off the ground before the next match starts and your opponent kicks you in the head so hard you die. Plus, half the maps in the arena mode are bad, and there are only four map. That means you effectively have two maps in the arena mode to play with which, as you can see from my playtime, gets old really fast. And the cherry on top is that, almost all of the complaints I have in the game have gone almost unchanged for years. The arena being too quick was added some time ago, and there are now two usable maps in arena mode, but after all this time that is not acceptable. My main problem with the game is, like many other reviews, the lack of meaningful updates from the devs. Look at Prison Architect, that game had a new feature, bug fixes, and polish added every month. Look at RimWorld, there are frequent, game changing updates from the devs. And now look at Overgrowth, where the only really meaningful things that have been added are a few new weapons and some maps for the arena. I doubt these issues will be fixed for months, and I am honestly doubting if the game will ever be finished, or if the devs will just release it in an unfinished state.  ",81,40,0,23,40,0,31

								I just.... God dammit. I want to recommend this game, really, I really really want to, but just.... I can't. I simply can't bring myself to do it.Pros:- Awesome technology at work- Fighting anthropomorphic animals- Some funny moments thanks to the physics of the game- Very interesting concept & design- Looks good (Graphically speaking)Cons:- Pretty buggy, all things considered- Crashes galore- Been 'in development' for a very, very long time (some 8-9 years and counting...)- Little to no actual 'content' (More at the bottom of the review)- Overwhelmingly overpowered AI, not fun to fight in the slightest- Combat woefully unsatisfying, even when you're good at it- Gross UIAlright, for whatever reason, there's a soft spot in my heart for this game, as I can't bring myself to refund it despite being perfectly eligible to do so (Or at least when I WAS eligible). However, I really don't reccommend buying this game because as I've said, there's just such little content, and the game has such little replay value, if any play value in the first place. There's just no way to guarantee you'll get your money's worth, and considering how painfully slow the development process for this game has been (if at all existent), there's little to no guarantee the game will ever even be 'completed', whatever that means in this case. Now, is that to say it's outright the worst garbage to ever disgrace steam with its presence? Oh hell no. On it's own, it honestly not so bad. However looking at it objectively and considering the sort of gameplay experience versus money spent ratio, and considering how long it took the game to even get to 'this' point, it's just such an awful deal, and really doesn't seem like the best investment one could make for a game. To put it into perspective, I currently have approximately 2.3 hours of gameplay on my account as of writing this review. I've literally experienced everything that this game has to offer in that time span, and admittedly I could have done it all in less time had I a better understanding of the full extent of the combat mechanics (My fault for not doing the tutorial which explains it all, not the games fault). That and I spent a considerable amount of time playing the Arena mode. Granted one might argue the 'endless' arena mode offers 'infinite' replayability, but that's just a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I give a solid 6-7 rounds (Maybe 5 minutes max, for all 6-7 rounds, if you really draw out each fight) in arena and you'll see everything there is to see. The 'campaign' itself I would estimate would take maybe an hour, give or take, maybe even less if you actually do the tutorial and screw up a minimal number of times.So, if all this rambling is to say anything, it's simply that I can't reccommend this game, but I can't condemn it either. It is what it is.TL;DR - Little to no content, little to no gameplay value, little to no reason to buy the game. Don't buy it, but don't hate it.			",269,32,1,35,15,0,12

								The game itself has a lot of potential. The creativity behind the concepts of the game along with the physics used make the game really fun...for about 30 minutes. It is most likely in buyers best interest to simply wait until the game finally comes out of alpha, which last month I would have said that would be twenty years from now. However, recently the devs did promise weekly updates and that they would basically start working on the game like they should have done so long ago. tl;dr Game is amazing, wouldnt buy it at the moment. Keep tabs on its development tho.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I really do love toying around with this game but I can't, in all good consciousness, recommend it. I'll be back to check on this game in a few months or so, and maybe I'll change my tune. But for now, give this one a pass and go buy something else.			",54,9,0,12,9,0,2

								All these years, and this is what is they have to show for it?? I loved Lugaru, but the fact that they are barely making any progress while selling this for $30, I'm beginning to wonder if the game will ever be finished.Maybe *someday* I will be able to recommend Overgrowth, and I hope that day comes, but currently it is barely even a functional game.

								Well, this sure is... a game. In Overgrowth, you play as a former war hero and bloodthirsty bunny who goes on a journey to revenge the death of his wife and daughter. Yeah, that happens.The story mode isn't specially long but it is specially hard, and ends up getting very frustrating. The best thing about this game is its combat, as you would expect being the game's main selling point. It's pretty complex, brutal, and quite honestly pretty fun once you start getting the hang of it. So why do I not recommend it even if I think it looks promising? Well, I've read it has been in development since 2008. They're charging you full price for a Beta that doesn't look like it's going to end anytime soon, and I just don't think there's enough content to justify it.			",102,14,0,10,6,0,3

								[+16] Fighting system. No spam-clicking, just hold down LMB and attacks are automated. What makes this special is that every attack is determined by movement. Go left for a roundhouse kick, straight ahead for a pushing kick, stay still to punch, crouch to trip...[+8] Attention to detail. There are lots of cool touches in this game. Thrown weapons will stick in wood but not in rock, and whether they stick at all is determined by where it lands. Every move is physics-based - when your rabbit punches, instead of animating a punch and reducing the opponent's health by 10, it properly simulates a rapidly moving fist, calculates pressure, and then applies damage based on relative velocity. All behind the scenes, so what you get is a cool fighting system that's really smooth.[-4] Infrequent updates. There's a lot already there, but the devs (a team of 3, by the way) release updates preeetty rarely.[-8] No real structure. A handful of challenges, and arena mode... that's it. This would be a deal-breaker if the blow wasn't lessened by the expansive level editor.OVERALL SCORE: +12			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A game where bunny homicide is the meaning of life.Pros: Fast, sharp gameplay, fantastic combat system that even factors momentum and where you hit the opponent. Ninja-like platforming, with a map editor.Community-made levels. and an arena mode made specifically for fighting.Cons: In beta mode, meaning there is still bugs, glitchy, and controls are all over the place.Overall, I would have to give it an 8.5/10.Great game and highly reccommended, but only if you are able to put up with♥♥♥♥♥♥			",107,18,0,16,16,0,9

Early Access Review
								Initially, Overgrowth seems like it would be a lot of fun to play; parkour, contextual combat and quite a few weapons to fight with. There are plenty of levels that people have created where you're given a huge tower to climb or have to fight enemies, but there are currently no campaign levels created by the developers themselves. At the moment, Overgrowth is little more than a level editor with decent (but shallow and fairly limited) combat. With the combat being as limited as it is, there doesn't feel like much reason to play the game right now which is made worse by the lack of multiplayer. From the sporadic updates the devs give on their YouTube channel, it seems likely that the game will end up being genuinely good once the game has some focused level design. However, considering it has been in development for six years and has only a small possibility of being in beta by the end of the year, it's not really worth spending £22 on what is (currently) a glorified level editor. Once the developers release the full campaign mode (which is unlikely to happen for a while) I will probably be able to recommend Overgrowth. Until the game is fully finished, I would recommend holding off on purchasing it and seeing whether you think the full game is worth it.			",174,23,2,12,6,0,5

It has a lot of potential to be something great, but it's been in development since 2008 and yeah, they do update it but the updates are rare and nothing major.For the price it's worth, I wouldn't recommend it.

At this rate the game might be done in... let's say 20 or more years. It's fun for a bit but pricey for such little content. I would recommend it if it was the full game the developers meant it to be, but right now it's more like an unfinished demo. Hate to say it.			",63,3,0,3,6,1,2

								Overgrowth has been in Early Access since the Kennedy Administration.  The gameplay is great.  It's unique and responsive and enjoyable to play, as well as to watch.  The graphics have improved quite a bit since it started.  Should we be upset that it's taking this long to develop?  Probably, but at least they are still working on it.  Is it worth the current price tag of $30?  If you like playing community content I'd say yes.  There's a lot of levels created by users out there that are a lot of fun to play.  Also, local multiplayer is a blast.  I would recommend waiting for a steam sale though, as it's on sale quite often.Check out beta gameplay here:

								This game is good for what it is, it's a combination of melee combat and parkour, both of which are handled well. However I am basing this review off of ""Is it worth the money?"" and the answer is no. This game has been in developement for over 8 years and is still in alpha. I have had this game for over 2 years and heres my experience with it:             The game has very little maps to play on, which are limited to arena, player vs player(Local Only), and then some random empty maps with no enemys. So basically you have to download maps out of the community content, which is where this game ultimatly faults. There are many errors and glitches which cause your whole game to crash, the game will also run very unstable on these maps.            So being that the custom maps are what generate most of the enjoyment in this game, and that they are subject to consistant crashing, and unstable gameplay, then I would not recommend this title to anyone for the time being. Hopefully in the future, the developers will bring this game into beta and have more content present for us. Right now though this game is very bare bones and it's only chance of being fully enjoyed is in the hands of modders that either create unstable content, or content this unstable early access game can't handle.

								I am kinda mixed as whether to recommend this right now. As others have said, it only recently came out on Steam and I've had it for over a year now. In that time, I have had a lot of fun with the combat system, and the fairly recent addition of the arena is a blast. However over the course of a full year very little progress has been made with the game, and I really am hoping one day to see a full open world that we can explore while fighting enemies along the way. Nothing like that is implemented yet though, so I don't think I can recommend this until it is. Obviously the combat is a blast, but other than that there's just not enough content here to warrant a thirty dollar purchase, IMO. Nevertheless, keep an eye out, because like I said this game definetly has the most brutal and enjoyable and 'realistic' combat system around!			",105,28,6,16,13,5,6

								I feel like I'm alone in saying the game excels more the acrobatics than it does in the combat. I've always had more fun jumping around and exploring than I did in the arena mode (although I did do that every once in a while and still had some fun.); but for some reason, anything over 1v1 combat in this new story mode feels cheap and unfair. You could argue ""but it's only in beta!"", but that argument goes out the window when it's been in development for 9 years. People say that the combat is extremely fluid, but I don't really see it. You get two buttons, one to attack, one to block. It makes it difficult to do any sort of combos that can get you out of a tough situation. oh, and before anyone says it, no I'm not complaining that it's too hard, I'm complaining that there's a lack of options for combat that I didn't really have a problem with during arena mode for whatever reason. Also, not making a huge point of this because it could just be early dialogue, but man is it terrible. It feels like something ripped out of an edgelord's naruto fanfic. I honestly hope that gets better.Anyway, before this gets too long, I'll just say don't pick this game up for anything over $15 and don't pick it up if you're expecting a super in depth exploration game. $30 is waaaaay too much for the amount of time it's taking to get out of development.Also, if you disagree and you see something I don't, instead of hitting the ""not helpful"" button, comment and lemme know. I really want to like this game, but I just can't find any reason to.			",255,43,3,23,28,2,21

Early Access Review
								I would be lying if I said the game was anywhere near perfect. I would also be lying if I said this game had vastly improved  since I bought it a few years ago. This game is not very good to be honest, but there are redeming factors that make it worth your time. Negatives:It is REALLY buggy and often crashes.There is not a lot of content to sink your teeth into.There is hardly any variation in the animals you play as.Most enemies are stupid and aren't that hard to kill.The platforming is grossly underutilised.The game doesn't offer a wide variety of maps.The campaign takes about ten minutes to beat.It is a lot more difficult to get mods than it should be.There is only one campaign at the moment, and hardly any stealth gameplay to be seen.No online multiplayer.Positives:THE COMBAT    This game is not great, but the combat alone makes it enjoyable. The mechanics are solid and make you actually time your movements to ensure you hit your target. You need to block at the right moment to catch your enemy off guard and land a solid blow to the head. The weapons play remarkably well and increase the intensity of an already intense battle. The satisfaction you feel after defeating a horde of enemies is immeasurable. The game does not offer a whole lot of stealth to enjoy, so it is up to you to create your own moments in the editor. It is not hard to be stealthy, but quietly picking off your foes one by one is enjoyable none-the-less.      I definitely recommend getting this game if you have the money. It might be more convenient to wait for a sale, but that is up to you. It is also important to know that this game is in Alpha (and has been for 6 years), so it is definitely not a reflection of the final product, with updates coming regularly.			",109,37,1,15,16,0,10

								ros:- The game is the first game (Besides Lugaru, their earlier game) that has had this fantastic and intuitive combat system.- It is quite unique to find a game where you have the same chances to die as the AI enemy has, and all that keeps you alive is skill. Take for example Call of Duty where you have much more health than the AI opponenets. Of course there is also a need of skill in Call of Duty, all i'm trying to say is that Overgrowth is very unique on those two exact points. And for this point i count it as a pro, but someone else could easily count it as a con, so as i said in the beginning, these are just my opinions.- I've always loved gladiator games/modes and the arena mode in Overgrowth is a great idea. But as much as this is a pro, it's also a con, becuase i feel that they could have improved the mode so much. For example they could have added the actual possibility to achive something like a new rank, so you could compete global. Take for example the Fifa Ultimate Team mode, they feature divisions, and if you win enough games out of 10, you move up. They could add things like this to make the game mode a game for itself.- Superpowers without superpowers. I love how you can jump high, long and run on walls, but what i love even more is that everyone else can too. You're not overpowered in any unfair way, it is just plain fun! Just as before this may be a pro for some, and a con for others.- The realism. The fact that some kicks and punches are more lethal compared to others, and it is a mather of the placement. The fact that if you get kicked into a wall you are most likely to suffer dramatically more damage, and you're most likely dead if it was the second kick or punch. Just as before this may be a pro for some, and a con for others.Cons:- Lack of worked through gamemodes. As fun as the game is, no matter how much you like it. Killing the same old rabbit without achieving anything just becomes boring at some stage. - Multiplayer. I really wish that they at some point will add multiplayer to the game.- The fact that they haven't made one proper level yet also is a bad disappointing.- The sounds aren't really that satisfying, you could really wish for some better sound effects when the combat system is so great, but the sound just dosen't match you lethal and awesome kicks. Finally my score for this game would be 8/10That was all i could think off first handed. I'm looking forward to you guys opinions :-)- Jaza777			",31,1,0,5,1,0,6

								I enjoy this game quite a lot, but am not able to access the SPF or, of course, the SUM launcher. I traded a game from a monthly Humble Bundle for a Steam key of Overgrowth. I realized a few days after that I can't right click on the game to find a CD key via Steam. I contacted the Wolfire team and they were quick and helpful with their emails, and their final advice was to check how the game was activated on Steam to see if it was the ""Activated as part of: Overgrowth Retail."" It was to my displeasure to find it was, meaning they could do nothing to help. In short, there is no possible way to access the SPF or SUM launcher if you've traded and haven't made sure you have received a CD key. The game is fun and the team running it is helpful, but there should certainly be SOME way to check the legitimacy of the game (which they were able to do after I followed their instructions) and THEN be able to help the player get their CD key that is missing. I get an urge to play the game sometimes... But then I'm reminded I can't enjoy it to its full potential. If I knew I was not going to received the CD key, I would not have made the trade. At least not at this point in development. Although the idea of giving in and purchasing it directly is not far from my mind, I can't promise I will do so and feel I'll have to keep it a No for now.			",90,6,1,8,5,0,12

								Unfortunately if you buy from a 3rd party retailer, you have a good chance of recieving only ""half"" of the game as the ""Secret Forum"", requires another key to access the client to play community maps and mods. This is likely to prevent people from buying from a 3rd party retailer. They failed to mention this anywhere and when I contacted them, they told me I would have to purchase the game again. Unless they integrate the client without requiring an additional key, then I will never recommend this game and I will never buy another game from this developer, considering they ever get around to finishing this one.

Firstly just to make it clear I enjoy the game without a doubt but my real reason for not recommending it is the time it has taken. I played Lugaru at an early age and in these following years I have been awaiting Overgrowths release for years. It is and definitely will become (if it ever is finished) an amazing game in the years to come. I really enjoy this game but with no story it gets boring very quickly and please read before judging me as I do enjoy this game but many reasons make up why I don't recommend it.Pros:•Gameplay is awesome and action packed•Physics are awesome•You can play as ninja rabbits, dogs, rats, cats, wolves, hares.•Graphics are good and blood is quite realisticCons:•Been in development since 2008 (Most new games an indie team makes game in year or less to release into early access, this game has been in early access for 7 years now and the team consists of 4 people)•Boring with no real story•Glitchy at times and you can't say 'its understandable' as its in early access FOR 7 YEARS! (I understand most other indie games are released really buggy and some not with such good physics and great graphics as Overgrowth, although I fail to see why it has taken so long and updates consist of minimal changes at times)Overall it's a good game with a lot of potential but then again this potential has still taken 7+ years to unveil itself and I am not sure at this rate of updates (about once every few months) that it will become great in a short space of time. It could mould into an open world/parkour/survival game where you kill other animals for pleasure or food, build a hut to live in, etc,  etc. The future of this game is in the devs hands and it doesn't seem they know what to do with it. They have had more than enough time to at least make it something better and they have failed to do so. I think they can still improve and make this an amazing game, but for now its not recommended by me.Note: Its been 8 months now since I wrote this review and still, main thing being added in updates is bug fixes. Take a look for yourself, this was  the most recent update (in a while)New arena modeMajor optimizations like instancing and z-prepassOption for simplified shadow rendering to greatly improve performance on slower GPUCan enable and disable mods from different folders, instead of having to overwrite game dataPost processing including color grading and HDR bloomGlobal illumination through tetrahedral light probe meshUpdated renderer from OpenGL 2.2 to 3.2 coreScript improvements (dictionary support, script fragments, etc)Fixed arena crash bug (usually when a level ends in which weapons were used)Command line flags to load specific levels or alter configNew update:Added 3  New Arenas: Cave Arena, Magma Arena and Waterfall Arena. Story Mode now has levels although as soon as I load them it crashes the game3 August 2016Played a bit of the campaign which is currently just fighting in the arena but it's a start.December 2016 & January 2017Added the Lugaru campaign which has now been made in Overgrowth. Really fun but rather quick to finish (took me less than an hour). Still a lot of progress and hopefully they are going to add Overgrowths story in the future. Also Overgrowth is now in Beta.

								I got this game when it was on sale a while back and i love this game,but the game devs are takeing FOREVER makeing this game and doing pointless things with no real changes with the actual game and i had my fun with it but it NEEDS TO MAKE ACTUAL CHANGES TO THE GAME.The devs dont seem to realize this and its really sad.All they seem to be doing is small things like grapical changes and at one point ""makeing it so the ears dont clip through your body when you do things"".who has ever messaged a friend like ""YO DOOD THEY FIXED THE EAR THING OMG 10/10"".im not saying fixing things like that are bad things but when your fixing things like that vs better gameplay you can see were it can get people mad and i agree,The changes they made are things some games make in a single year and thats sad.... really sad.It makes me feel like there getting paid for doing nothing and then comeing up with a small change just so they can make a little vidieo on what they changed that makes me more and more sad eachtime seeing what little progress they made in such time.I feel i did get my moneys worth but this game is really up my alley,i feel the avrage gamer would not like it and thats why i cant recomend it unless they acually make meaningfull changes to the game.this game has potential but its not good at the moment .(sorry for the bad spelling)(UPDATE)- also after the latest update i found the game very hard to run for no reason even though my pc is decent and should be able to run it fine.so in short DONT BUY THIS GAME (yet)			",48,12,1,6,22,1,4

								Overgrowth is still in development, and may be for some time.This doesn't stop it from being one of the better games I have purchased this year. The combat mechanics are beyond amazing, and you'll find youself spending hours playing with them, and mastering them.There is also the nice thought that there is more to come, and a good amount of player created content means this game will be relevant for years to come.Pick it up, give it a whirl and support an amazing work of art!Edit: Still enjoy this game, although not as much as the price would warrant.I am aware that the developer is working on a new update and is going to flood us with new content, instead of small updates with minimal content. A new person has also been hired, from what I hear. So I would suggest still supporting the dev as I feel this is a great game and there's plenty to look forward to.			",258,48,10,31,42,1,30

								Okay, first thing I really want to say about this game is: Words will never be able to describe how much fun you'll have with this game!The combat system in this game is REALLY great. It works well, never fails, and is realistic.The damage system is awesome. You can flip by pressing shift. If you flip at the wrong time and land on your neck, you die.The animations are smooth and nice, they make it feel like real life.The AI is neat. You gotta be careful because the AI can hear your foot steps.You know what? Stop reading this review. Just go and buy this game and you'll never leave your computer for a few days.The verdict: Played this game for 8.7 hours the first day I got it.Alpha Score: 9.5/10NOTE: This game's in Alpha, my review may change, but I still think the game's a masterpiece.

								I am going to start off by saying, I DO like this game. However, the reason I don't reccomend it is because it's barely a game yet. There's nothing to do other than the fight mechanics which get quite boring and abusable after a while. They are good at first, but the only challenge the game can add is more health or faster attacks from enemies. The amount of good levels is sparse and there aren't enough ingame objects to make very good levels yet. Also, updates roll out painfully slow. This game has been in develoment for years and still isn't very fun for long periods of time.Overall, it's a good concept but seriously needs some more work before I can reccomend it. If it was 5-10 dollars, I would reccomend it, but $30? That's almost thievery.			",125,8,1,10,12,0,4

								Brilliant fun as it is but unfortunately it's stuck in development hell. The price tag is a bit much considering it's an Alpha game. However if you do get it then don't forget to download the SUM-Launcher, it enables access to mods and community items which make the game feel a lot more complete.If you're willing to pay the $30 price tag for an incomplete but fun game stuck in development hell then I strongly recommend it, otherwise wait for a sale.

								This alpha shows a lot of promise right now. FIghting is very fun but confusing  and can get slightly repetative, graphics and physics are spot on (especially the blood, looks really cool) Something you need to understand before buying this game though is that though it is playable it is still in very early development and there is still a lot to be done. It crashes very frequently and there is very little you are able to do unless you want to learn all the console controls, which I'm currently in the process of and its taking me quite a while. The game isnt ready yet but damn is it going to be amazing when it's finished. Highly recomend people buy this because it fun as it is now, and will only get more fun. Keep up te good work Wolfire!

								Okay, first thing I really want to say about this game is: Words will never be able to describe how much fun you'll have with this game!The combat system in this game is REALLY great. It works well, never fails, and is realistic.The damage system is awesome. You can flip by pressing shift. If you flip at the wrong time and land on your neck, you die.The animations are smooth and nice, they make it feel like real life.The AI is neat. You gotta be careful because the AI can hear your foot steps.You know what? Stop reading this review. Just go and buy this game and you'll never leave your computer for a few days.The verdict: Played this game for 8.7 hours the first day I got it.Alpha Score: 9.5/10NOTE: This game's in Alpha, my review may change, but I still think the game's a masterpiece.

								As this game enters Beta, it becomes officially playable.The combat was never lackluster, but the introduction of a campaign, however bare-bones, breathes real life into this game. The combat is quite varied and versatile: There's effective stealth, where to keep from being seen you have to track your enemy's movements and keep them in your sight at all times. Sneaking up behind someone allows you to deal lethal damage, and the deadliest attacks (rabbit kick) are the most difficult (and satisfying) to perform. Since there's a screen-share PvP feature, a map creation kit, and an endless Arena mode, I can't really complain for replayability. On higher-end devices, or on lower settings, the game performs well enough for me to recommend it. Solid 7/10, an anticipated 9/10 once it's been polished and leaves Beta.			",135,32,9,11,4,1,6

								1. This game needs to be nerfed BAD. Full disclosure; I'm not very good at this game. Even so, I can discern parts of this game that need serious balancing despite my own ineptitude. Very few elements of the combat system need to be tweaked, I think just giving the player a little more sturdiness might help, maybe slow the AI down by.008 of a second. It just needs a spitshine and it's perfect. 2. This combat system is the most exciting and original thing I've seen in a long time. There;s so much to love in this game. It's like it is just sitting around waiting to be a classic/ This game will be a game-changer when it is realeased...which brings me to my third point.3.  I'm  nervous about the development of this game. It's clear the developers are on to something amazing here, but how long is it going to take? It seems like most of the elements are here for a groundbreaking game, but I look at the dev posts (I have to be honest, I haven't been following the development of this game, I just looked over a few of the patch logs on the store page.) and see it's taken about a decade to get to the state it's in now. It's clear enough that this isn't just some cash grab, but it makes me nervous all the same. I want nothing but the best for this cool little game, and it's developers.			",232,80,2,26,21,5,34

								So... its about 7-8 year from announcement of this game. I bought this game in first days of 2014, that was alpha and even then i dont expect much from this game and i was complete sure that release wouldnt be soon. Same opinion right now, no big expectations, but game is good and its good that we can play Lugaru on this engine, looks cool, hard as ♥♥♥♥ just like in past, few things changed, of course (wolf became less dangerous than rabbit, lolwat?) for example we cant jump higher if first sit, like in Lugaru. That was my problem in first level when i trying climb on rock in our village. So first mustdo thing its complete tutorial :DWell, game have potential, + and - you can check in other review, so i type few wishes:1. Developers should fix lags on arenas, After Lugaru story there is nothing to do, so we go on arenas to train our fight skill (lol, fight just like roulette. Right now you defat in 1v1 huge rabbit, after that you died, because fall down on your back when trying rabbit kick) and... there are lags. Mostly in deathmatch 1v1v1v1 with weapons.2. Music on arenas. It doesnt repeats! WTF guys? No, maybe i should listen my own, i have few in folders, but.. realy, fix it. Also when music stops lags get full power, especialy when rabbits a lot, maybe its connected somehow :D3. You should add customization for our arena's rabbit, thats will cool, maybe that should be 1 thing in this list....3+n. Add multiplayer, Versus is fun, but normal multiplayer will be really cool, especialy on Arenas. huh, maybe in 2019? :D			",159,7,1,17,9,2,18

								It's fun so far but it could use some improvement.The main things that bugged me with the combat were not being able to lock-on to an enemy, enemies slashing with knives way too quickly to be able to block or counter, and enemies being able to disarm you too easily. If there were some sort of quick-time event or ""struggle"" mini-game that might help balance it out a bit. I also noticed that enemies often run away when you try to do a jump-kick attack but I might just be timing it poorly.I'd recommend buying it.			",39,3,2,6,1,0,0

The campaign is basically just introducing a new enemy every ""level"" and increasing the amount of them until you complete the game. Every level is just killing a couple of guys then loading a new level.			",114,28,1,14,8,0,4

								This very much feels like the beta release that it is... And that's not a bad thing, the game lacks polish and it's only fair to note that Overgrowth is developing slowly, but it was a pleasant surprise to see that it is still developing.Overgrowth is, at it's heart, quite a simple, very fluid parkour / kung fu game played at blistering speed and with an interesting damage system which left me wincing in more than one situation as a brutal kick sent me face first into a rock or a building for an instant KO. Landing face first, does matter. The locational damage system will leave you just hoping that maybe you survived that hit. But what's more rare is that the weapons actually feel weirdly realistic most of the time, to the point that in the storyline mode (which isn't great, but it's not the worst I've played) you will fear and respect when you meet an enemy with a knife... And learn the value of fighting only one enemy at a time.Sure, the graphics are a little dated, sure, the combat seems simple (it's actually a little more nuanced than you might first give it credit for), but it's a rare case when ragdoll physics actually adds to the feel of a title, rather than take away. Oh, and the AI is unforgivingly hard, whilst not actually being unfairly so. Contrary to the feeling you're likely to get at the first fights, you CAN beat the story mode.Well, the storymode is basically a port of the company's earlier title, Lugaru, to the new engine. If you haven't played Lugaru, it answers four questions and defines a word quite well.Q) So, if a rabbit got into a fist fight with a pack of wolves... Who would win?A) The wolves.Q) How about if the rabbit knew kung fu?A) The wolvesQ) Give the rabbit armor?A) The wolves winQ) And a sword?A) The wolves still win.Definition: Hubris - A rabbit thinking he can win in a fist fight with a pack of wolves.And yes, I still giggle when a member of said pack of wolves punts you clean into the next valley. For all of the fluid feeling kung fu, powerful hits can get wonderfully silly.Did I enjoy it? Yes.			",146,25,0,16,19,3,25

								when I bought this game I didn't know what to expect, I'd dicked around on someone else's copy before but in all honesty it was an impulse buy, I was immediately terrified and intruiged when I saw it was a mesh of fighting game, platformer and creative tool. I for one am not patient enough to work with editors, the closest I get is making tiny little baby levels in MoW's GEM editors (please make a feature for smoothing hill textures specifically). This game has sat on my pc for the better part of 3 years, and every time I play it I remember why I love it. It's the only fighting game I'd say I'm good at, which is probably because the only other fighting game I actually ever play is Skullgirls (just buy it), and I get a satisfaction in creating red MS Paint streaks and hearing simulated cracking of simulated bones breaking. The latest patch (as of November 25, 2016) has taken out many features I previously enjoyed, which included a set of missions featuring rabbits, a sandbox platforming area (did I mention platforming and wall running yet? You can do those too), as well as ""editor tools"" which were available in the arena to hilarious effect (commands include making yourself a wolf, dog, cat, making everyone flop to the ground, reviving yourself, and killing everyone but you). All of these were taken out. In their place I find 3 new arenas to fight in (which all have bugs, but it's something new and fun) and the 'editor' mode which remains... foreign to me. I would say this game is a great game. If you ever see it on sale for less that 15USD I reccomend it. Until then... just bum it off your friend's library.			",69,1,0,8,5,1,17

A sandbox-ish game where you can spawn NPCs, weapons, make your own maps and share it using the community SUMLauncher, and other fun things. The performance from the update a212 and forwards has really doubled, made me go from a wonky 30-40 FPS to a stable 60 FPS. I recommend this game, the blood, the combat, the movement and the physics in it are also good.			",89,14,0,10,4,0,4

								Overgrowth is a fantastic game that deserves far more attention than it has ultimately received. The fighting mechanics are some of the best I've ever seen and the parkour is great. Overgrowth can be very challenging at times, but after some practice you'll probably be able to get the hang of it. The sandbox mode is fantastic and the level design is remarkable. There are also a ton of great features that I wish other games would implement into their user interface somehow. Plus, the graphics are amazing for an indie game! But so far, there is no actual story mode or any missions. I would recommend buying this game later when there is a campaign or waiting to buy it when it goes on sale. Otherwise, I give this game a 9/10 so far.			",159,17,0,8,6,1,5

								Do you like animals? Do you like karate? Do you like animals beating the living crap out of each other? Then you will love this game. There are about 7 different races of animals to play as (all mammals) rabbit, rat, cat, wolf, dog, and ROBOBUNNY! Each has its own attributes, rabbits jump high, rats are short- derp, cats... i dont know what cats do yet, wolves are one hit killers, i have no idea what dogs do, and robobunnies cause lag.There is plenty of things to do in this game, will without campaign- sadly, there is still a large sand box allowing you to make custom levels and even your own campaign, dialog, outfits (in a way). While this game advertises parkour, i still have yet to climb to the top of the most simpliest of pillars, but it is an indie game and i soon hope to see some improvements and more content. To top it off, the controls are responsive, good karate moves, fun with sharp things, and great mechanics, but to every good reveiw there is a bad part. This game is more for higher end computers, the game is lacking in content like a campaign, and ironically hitting people causes lag- which is a good thing because its not like the point of the game is to hit anyone right?  Now for the only part you are probably going to read, do i suggest this game? What you see in the video on the store page is pretty much all there is to it, but it is already well polished and even if you arent interested in it now, jump on and when the game hits its full price you might like it, or just buy it to support the devs. Anyways thanks for reading these last few sentences, or really thank for reading this paragraph i forked 10 minutes over to.What you need devs, is to fix some weps (dog hammer, glaive, ect) and co-op, i have been enjoying the rabbit dropkicking goodness that is this game for almost a year, which means the versus isnt really doing it for me and my cousin. so if you could add co-op challenges, maps, or arenas, i would be most greatful. Also cuddos for you if you actually bothered to read this far into my review			",98,2,0,6,6,1,1

								Lugaru, at its time, was a very mechanically sound fighting-game for what  the developers had at the time, and Overgrowth is sure to deliver once it finishes development. For where Overgrowth is at now, it shows great potential of being a great third-person fighting game with anthropomorphic animals, but don't let the latter turn you off. The fighting mechanics are easy to learn, but difficult to master, with precise timing being the key to whether you defeat you opponent or you gettting pummeled to the ground. The game also shows off its beauty with a very gorgeous engine, with the models of each character being well-detailed and constructed, and the enviorments, although simple, showing off some very interesting architecture. The technology for the damage system is quite nice as well, with it being based off skeletal-like models, and recieving more or less damage in certain areas and how hard the impact is on the models. Weapon combat, just like in hand-to-hand combat, is very difficult to master, since the reaction time needed to block and parry attacks will determine whether you instantly get killed or come out unscathed. With the weapon combat comes the very nice blood decals, with every slice, stab, and thrown weapon leaving a nice, sharp cut or hole of blood on the body, probably the most realistic i've seen thus far in video games, though it only leaves blood marks and doesn't show signs of any physical degradation.But probably one of the biggest strong points of Overgrowth is its editor, which leaves the user to creating their own maps, missions, and stories to their hearts content. With the devs leaving a fairly abundent assortment of props, enviorments, path-finding and other tools to the user's disposal, it leaves the user with their imagination on what they wish to create, or what they want to test. Though it will take time getting used to a rather bare-bones UI, the capabilities given supplies the user a tool that will keep the game alive from now until hopefully way long after release.Although Overgrowth is still in development, it shows its technologic capabilities greatly, leaving only a few bugs and still incorporating mechanics like stealth into the mix. Although non-existant, it will be left to the users imagination what the story of Overgrowth will be about, and how our favorite ninja-rabbit Turner is doing after the events of Lugaru.

								I had high hopes when I bought this game OVER FIVE YEARS AGO! (back when it wasn't on Steam) There is still no end in sight and the progress isn't all that impressive even with the additional employees. It's a shame, because the actual gameplay is great. They could have released this 3-4 years ago with glowing recommendations from the highest outlest (as the game had some media buzz a few years back). If only they focused on online multiplayer! Instead time was wasted with pointless feature creep and obsessive early optimizations.Once this game gets online multiplayer (which was promised on the website!) and steam workshop support it will be a great game, but not earlier. In its current state the novelty runs out in a few hours.			",382,149,6,45,37,3,53

								To make this simple Overgrowth is an amazing sandbox game. You can watch as many videos as you want but you simply wont be able to grasp how fluid the fighting is until you buy it. The editor is very easy to use and fun. Without wasting your time I will just say I highly suggest this game.I review indie games and Overgrowth is one of them, if you want to see more infromation regarding mechanics and gameplay feel free to click the video below, thank you.

								TL;DR Version below! Points addressed: overview, Gameplay, combat, graphics, faults with the game, final thoughts.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overview: Overgrowth is an amazing game for such a small developement crew. It has all the feelings of a homemade game, but the quality is surprisingly great. The models used in the game have great detail, as well as physics. The new storyline they added to the game is unfinished, but I am glad that it is there. I feel the writing had a good story line, but the diologue was a little poorly carried out. If they polish it up later on, I feel multiple story lines will make this game a real gem. There is also an arena mode, where you can fight in randomly generated senarios and fight to your heart's content. I have not yet tried out the multiplayer mode, (where you can fight a friend) but I would assume it would make for a great challenge. Gameplay: First off, this is a difficult game to grasp at first. I found myself being frustrated halfway through the story mode, because I had no idea how to properly block, even after the tutorial. I had to look up an actual youtube video, and then practice fighting. However, after you learn how to play, and become good at it, it makes for some amazing fight scenes, and cool strategies. Speaking of strategy, that is a HUUUUUUUGE factor to this game while playing story mode. It is very difficult to just run in guns blazing and beat the snot out of your enemies. You have to assess your situation and plan accordingly, and if your plan fails, you either formulate a new one, or die. On a side note, the physics on of this game are amazing, I love how they take into account that you can break bones or snap your neck during battle, it really adds some realisim to the mix. Combat: This is by far the main aspect of the game, and the combat role certainly fills that status. The movements are not over-exhagerated, and you feel a sense of power with each of your strikes. The only downfall is when you fight more than one opponent, it is hard to fend off everyone with the current move set. I can definitely feel the gaping hole where splash damage attacks should be, and I hope something is added later on. If you look at my screenshots, you can see that I had difficulty with a level because there were four opponents (all armed) and even while I tried being sneaky and killing them one at a time, they were too smart and eventually all rushed me. Once they surrounded you, it was a flurry of furry arms and legs, then when the smoke cleared, a mangled model of what you think might be your character is left in the middle. Another thing I found, is that there is a lack of range weapons. Adding a bow and arrow would be a huuuuuuge advantage, but it would be much better than taking the odds of throwing your sword or dagger. Half the time when I tried throwing weapons, they would either catch them, or it would just bounce off, rendering the attack useless. Also, I have no idea why, but the staff is DEADLY AF. the opponent may have a sword (which is an instant kill) but if you have a staff, that poor bunny has no hope in hell. All it takes is for you to get him to ragdoll, and then you can poke the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of him on the ground until he is dead. Opponents are also merciless with the staffs, and just wreck house with them. Forget about the swords, get a staff.Graphics: For a small crew of indie game makers, the graphics are phenominal. I really love the detail in the characters, and the landscapes arent too shabby. With a bigger budget, or just lots of time (this game has been around a while, I am sure they have a huge update coming, and I can't wait!) I am sure the environments will become more detailed.Faults: Some weapons are insanely overpowered, like I mentioned before, if your opponents have a staff, then you are screwed unless you judo throw them, which can be difficult to do. I found myself being poked to death on the ground a few more times than I would like to admit. To be fair, this is something that the player needs to learn to combat against, and I like that. Also, enemies can block INSANELY well, which makes getting an opening for an attack seemingly impossible at times. The only way I found to get around this was to block an attack from the enemy, and then counter it with one of my own. This method only really works against a single target however, and is difficult to fight multiple people. On a different topic, I believe that the music could be mixed a bit better into the gameplay. Usually you'll have blaring battle music come out of nowhere, and during a cutscene it will cut and become something entirely different. Also in the future I think that a more diverse sound track would make the game really pop. Final Thoughts: I absolutely love this game, I really hope the developers come out with more content soon, especially since they are going to have a boost in funding from the sale that is active at the time of writing this. Definitely pick this one up and give it a try. If you suck at it, learn how to play it and beat up those bandits! The feeling of learning how to fight and crush your enemies is really a rewarding feeling, and a lot of games don't give you that reward aspect anymore.TL;DR!: Buy this game! it is hard to learn at first, and has a few quirks in the combat system, but it is well worth the money.

								Overgrowth is a bunny platformer action game... that's been developed since World War II. Probably as a way to kill Stalin.So... the combat's fast paced and great. It's robust. Two thumbs up for it.The platforming's slightly wonky, but some fixes could help it out and have it become truly great. One thumb up for it.The graphics also look very good while still demanding relatively little from your computer. But there are also issues with it. Some effects seem to slow down your game quite a lot. For example looking at a spot could suddenly make your game run at 10fps while it had been running at a speed of 55-60fps. No thumbs up but no thumbs down either.Bodies have proper skeletons and the damage engine is great as well. Take this as an example: You run, jump high and... you fall on your head. You break your neck and die. That's it, you're done. Dead. Two thumbs up for that as well.And here come the problematic things:The campaign in the game is bare-bones at best. At worst it's a bunch of levels stringed together with minimal dialogue. One thumb down for that.And the main, real issue about this whole game. The amount of content compared to the amount of money being asked of you. It's just an awful deal. For $5, this game would be perfect. Even for $10 it'd be a good deal. But $30?? That's just outrageous. Not to mention that the sale prices are nothing to write home about either ($18 was the lowest in Feb 18th 2014). I did everything in the game in 2 hours. And also looking at the pace of the updates, I doubt that you'll get much more content soon. Don't buy this at full price. It was recently in the Humble Freedom Bundle, so maybe you can get a hold of a copy that's from that bundle, making the price relatively cheap.Overall:As a game - 6/10As a product - 3/10(All games start at a 5/10 and move up and down based on pros and cons in the game)			",543,172,24,62,101,8,72

								*Do not buy this if you aren't too great with 3D game engines or level editors, as this game is yet to have much of a campaign and is extremely limited when it comes to pre built challenges and tasks.*What is great about Overgrowth is the amazing movement and combat system, both are very fluid, enjoyable and challenging. The overall look of the world and design of characters is both beautiful and unique.Sadly this game has been in development for several years and will most likely not be completed any time soon.But if you're like me and enjoying setting up your own missions and levels then you'll have hours of fun. And if you just want to jump in to a campaign filled with diverse enemies and challenges... you may have a few years to wait.			",315,38,3,30,14,0,28

								I really want to like this game, but judging by the pace the development is going, I think my grandchildren are still never going to see the finished game. Ever since I backed the project (what has been maybe a year or two ago) I've seen NO visible changes in the game. Sure, every couple months there's the occasional bug fix, but these usually deal with some animation issue or a minor tweak to combat that you never noticed anyway. The larger bugs, such as the constant crashes or failing to load, the developers have steered clear of and have not attempted to fix in any way.However, there is one pro to the game - it has, what I consider, the absolute BEST combat in any game out there. It feels like you're really in the action, allowing you to control exactly how you hit while keeping the game very quick paced (and it manages to do this without the ""mash X to kill"" technique many games use - if you haven't looked up the controls, go do it, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised). As such, if you find you enjoy sitting in the arena and fighting a couple rounds every once in a while, then I would wholeheartedly recommend this game. However, you shouldn't expect any more progress to be made on it - not now, not ever - because it simply isn't coming.			",80,13,0,7,13,0,8

But there are some insides and outs for this game.PROS:1. great graphics and textures2. rag doll physics (my personal favorite)3. level editor4. editing your characterCONS:1. not having certain skyboxes or textures2. failing to buffer data3. crashing randomlyBut wait! there's more! ;)As awesome as this game is, it's been in development for 7 YEARS! AND IT'S STILL IN EARLY ACCESS! There's obviously a problem, if the Alpha is past 200, even 150!But hey, at least it's out for us to play. It's a big improvement from Lugaru. Once it's done, we can continue Turner's adventure to stop new danger or whatnot. I recommend this game, it's really fun to play			",87,13,0,4,11,1,4

								DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THISI bought the game in bundle. Finished the ""campaign""(which is more like bunch of scenarios) in about an hour and a half. Played arena for half an hour. 3 hours into the game and I'm already bored.""Don't worry, early acces, it must be new"". Nope, been around for around 10 years? I can't even understand how can you keep creating a game for 10 years and still make it feel like it was developed half a year ago.Plus the price. If you got it for 1$, you could think about buying, but otherwise don't get it. Waste of money and time. Example why it's bad?Google ""Overgrowth multiplayer"". See the dates? Now look at this: http://blog.wolfire.com/2006/12/lugaru-2-multiplayer/Practically the same game attempting(!) to have a multiplayer. Fast forward 11 years(!) and STILL NO MULTIPLAYER and looks the same?I wish it was never in the bundle. No multi, no replayability, no depth, campaign is short and simple, game feels like was developed half a year ago and the retail price is a joke.			",169,47,0,25,18,1,32

								Ill start saying this will be a great game. WILL be, but IS NOT. I paid 30 bucks and i havn't been able to entertain myself for more than five minutes in one sitting. Although this game has great physics and is fun as all hell to play with a friend, it only takes you like a fight or two before you're just running around. As this stands, which currently I don't think is fair to price at 30 bucks, I would have to say do not buy this game. Maybe a decade from now when the next update comes out they'll add another map.Pros: -Excellent physics fighting and character animations-Overall concept is solid (but not fully backed with story)-Controller compatable-Art and play style is unique enough to label this game as its own genreCons: (keep in mind these end up like a rant)-I've seen one update since I bought it, and that was like over three or four months ago                  -On the same note: update history is really really bad. Being both very far apart and little changes made-I have not found any kind of story mode or arcade mode of any kind to give you a goal.-The two modes that are most prominant are still really bland. Versus in a giant field with a single rock in the middle, and the arena mode is just a big box you fight in. -I still have not determined what the point of having different races is in the versus mode if they haven't been given any real balancing to make them unique. Changing from a bunny to rat only really makes you smaller, but you seem to still do the same damage and have the same health. -Weapon combat still seems really awkward, you either slash the enemy down in one swing, or you just throw your weapon and they cant block it. -The development of any kind of goal in the game is nowhere to be seen. I've seen dev videos showing new things and mechanics spotlights, but where the hell are the missions and challenges? We can't just fight the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥AI the entire time, theres nothing else to do. Not even a town to go talk to people in a free roam map or anything, no character names with stories or a world to explore and get sucked into the game with. Just... Pick your little map thing and play it for a minute, then close the game. I apologize for how long the cons were, but really this is a game that needs some major love. I wish i could recommend it to people, I'd like to see it go somewhere. With the condition its in, that will never be the case. The dev's are just pocketing the profit from whoever falls for the cool trailers of fighting. If you see this for a dollar, buy it! Its worth your dollar, but do not support developers that are this bad to thier game.			",102,6,2,7,12,1,0

								This game is fun. A nice combination of Parkour and Melee combat. WITH FURRIES!!! It has been in development since forever (like 2008), but the updates keep coming and are substantial. Also, having anthropomorphs that are realistic instead of Anime-ish is a nice change. There is a massive amount of community made content, but you need to do sketchy stuff to get to it. Freaking SPOF. Anyway, the Parkour is a normal 3rd person platformer, only you are a ninja rabbit. Also it doesn't suck. You can do more modren things like wall running and climb up ledges. The melee combat is interesting, as you can murder people (Rabbits, Wolves, Rats, Cats, and Dogs) by using weapons, or you can beat them up. Or you can keep beating them up after they are KO'ed and kill them. Stealth is important too, as you can sneak up on dudes to choke them out, or slit their throats, but lone guards might run away and get help. Or rush you with a sword. Then there is a arena, you can practice you combat skills there. It doesn't run very well on my PC though, I think I need more CPU power. 8 Turners out of 10			",63,6,5,7,2,0,3

								I had not played Overgrowth nor Lugaru until Overgrowth came out on steam. I had been following the updates on wolfire.net, checking some videos of it.  Then I got it, and I must say I highly reccomend this to ANYONE who likes fighting games, parkour games, or games that you can mod. It does not yet have a campaign to go off of, but the modding community and the SUM launcher provides good dialouge and many maps to play around with. I will go over some pros and cons of some of these catagories.Pros:Fighting- Fighting in this game is awesome. There is no getting the hang of it. You will no doubt get good, but you will no doubt be killed by someone. Although a little clunkly and odd, it has alot of fun potential. Weapons- Weapons are (At least to me) are very detailed. They shine in the light, and the blood reacts to them. Although not a huge variety, you can get mods that add hundreds more of these to the game.FPS- Only on a few maps does this game lag. As long as you keep down filtering any computer should be great to run this game. If you have a bad comp:Low settings: 40 fps.Max settings:  38 fps.Graphics- Not the best ever, but if it stayed this way, no one would complain. Stunning visuals, and again, with no lag.Blood- One of the most realistic in a game ever. Keep the blood on the full setting, and watch the cut open up, and watch the blood slowly trickle down and drop off you. Characters- Only nine characters, three of them rabbits. You have the rabbit, female rabbit, civilian rabbit, rat, cat, wolf, and dog. Each one of these each time you pick them is different. The color of the fur and clothes, and even the height and weight will change.Arena- This is a gamemode (Or a downloaded map) That pits you against another animal while thousands of fans watch. It will show you how popular you are, how many fans are in attendace, and how good the odds are of beating your opponent.Now come the cons.Cons:-No Multiplayer-Confusing combat-Very slow level loading times-A bit of a high priceOverall, I truly would reccomend this game to everyone. It is hands down incredibly fun, and very able to run on crappy PC's. ",62,14,0,8,18,0,13

								I've had this game for a long time now, and I still don't get bored with it. At this point, the game is pretty bare, but the potential is astounding, and the physics engine is phenominal; I don't think I've ever played in a better physics sandbox, actually. Combat is simple, but fast and fun. There's a stealth system, a weapons system, a massive array of easy to use world building tools, diverse character models, and the list goes on.Even in this early build, the game's combat can stand up to that of any action or figthing game out there. Since the player's power level is the same as each NPC, the game quickly becomes about skill and coordination, and in that aspect the game is very rewarding. You'll never find an opponent that you can't take on, and the only thing limiting your advancement is yourself.Oh, and the game also has a really fun parkour system. Overall, Overgrowth is ♥♥♥♥ing fun, and is my favorite Early Access game. Totally worth the $30 price tag. I can't wait to see how it turns out.(08/21/2014)EDIT: My Steam notes that I only have 2 hours on record for this game. In fact, I've owned the game for longer than it's been on Steam, and have only recently begun launching the game via Steam. Because, you know, manual patching is dumb.			",199,23,3,28,11,1,25

								This game is legitimately frustrating with how unfocused and wasted it is. It has so much potential but after what I heard is 9 years of development, all that's been coughed up is a moderately mediocre, inconsistent brawler. It's a shame because the movement, animations, visuals and overall design is phenominal. The presentation is lovely, boasting a realistic and viceral combination of ragdolls and blood. So much work went into such minor details, like how slitting someone's throat causes them to squirm and struggle for a few seconds before going limp. It's morbidly disgusting to watch. I don't think there's another game out there that has such a fluid and responsive parkour system. Granted, it's not perfect. Ledge grabbing could be easier and quicker, and the ability to slow down your movement speed (on keyboard and mouse) would be greatly appreciated. But overall, it's something quite special. Everything blends together near perfectly in combination with the animations, at almost no point during playing did I feel locked into an animation which I couldn't immediately jump out of at whim. The other main aspect of the game is combat, which personally, I find frustrating, inconsistent and overall just a mess of mechanics. Enemies bum rush you as soon as they see you and then never hesitate to take every available shot they can to take you down. If you're within their range, they will continuously batter you until you get out of it, after which they'll then full sprint towards you again. Their lack of hesitation between moves is the fighter equivalent of spamming buttons, and I find it frankly zero fun. Blocking is for the most part unexplained, thanks tutorial. You're introduced to it, but you aren't given any information beyond that. Something I found out on my own is that the direction you're moving also dictates where you block the strongest, something that REALLY should be mentioned in the tutorial. Couple this directional blocking with the zero hesitation from the enemies and in order to properly block you have to be constantly predicting how your opponent is going to attack next, which would be fine if the game wasn't so incredibly fast paced. They seemed to have tried a rock-paper-scissors approach to combat, just with about a thousand more variables. Which mind you, all of the enemies can perform with almost perfect certianty. It feels like I cranked up the difficulty to not only the highest, but the one that would be unlocked after beating the second highest. Personally, as a new player, this is horrible.Also, the combat in general is incredibly inconsistent on top of all of this, solely because a majoirty of your/the enemies' deaths will be from impact. As in, you knock them over and their face hits the floor. It's a cool mechanic, but it honestly makes every conflict even more of a gamble. It's always fun to beat the crap out of someone to then just have them kick you once and your face flies into a nearby wall, killing you instantly. My verdict overall on the combat is this: It's too fast paced and the enemies are too tenacious. It's very unfocused and in my opinion is a mess of mechanics and variables that really dampen the overall experience. It's inconsistent thanks to the ""impact"" mechanics. The combat is realisitc and intriguing, but isn't fun to play, not at this difficulty. (At least for me.)The overall content you get in this game is also not worth it at all. You get a ""campaign"" which frankly isn't very good. Some missions can take literally seconds and are walled between loading screens that sometimes take more time than that. It has a very ""super meat boy"" style feel to it's structure of leveling, except this is a brawler. One level you can load in and just about hold right click on the only enemy in it, and then be met with a level transition. Not good. On top of the campaign you get some disposable and unpolished arenas. It's waves of enemies that you cycle through, that's it.Such a bleeding shame. It really is disapointing, because there's so much potential to clean up the combat and abuse the movement more, but as it stands, don't purchase this game. It's not worth the price, has very little content, and the content that's there will most likely frustrate you more than anything.After such a long development time, I would have expected more. Much, much more.  ",286,45,8,14,21,2,23

								Buy it. Buy it now. There is not that much content, but you be assured it will come over time. This is probably the best Alpha stage game I have EVER played. The combat? 10/10. The action and movement? 11/10. The game feels amazingly fluid and fun, like Assassin's Creed's and Mirrors Edge had a child! The art is stunning - the blood and injuries are genius in design, they look hyper-realistic! The audio is amazing as well, there are over 2500 sound files, which make all the sounds varied and realistic. The physics add a whole new level to the gameplay; you can drop your weapon from a large height and brutally murder someone using only gravity!The only missing aspect is a full campaign - there is currently only an Arena and some challenge levels, but many more full levels are promised. Everything else is in place, and you can make your own levels with dialogue, stealth elements, characters, enemies, and everything in-between! The AI is also some of the best I have ever seen - it enriches the combat 10 fold! There are a few minor things that could be improved, but so far it has been an amazing experience.For a game in its alpha stages, made by an indie team of four guys, this is literally a masterpiece.

			Hello there person of the internet! New to this channel maybe subscribe! Brief Description I know what you're thinking, whoa, whoa, whoa mister Clever this game is still in development.		

Okay well let me start by saying that I am already hooked on Overgrowth! (Well I have been for a while now, I have owned before it was on Steam. So please ingnore my steam hours I have many more on the SUMlauncher.) So this game has a little bit of everything that is needed for a fun action game, good combat, nice controls, and character diversity. These things all then blend together to make this game enjoyable to play. It also has a pretty kickin' editor for map making, you can even make your own little mission if you felt like it then you could upload it to the modding community which might I add has some awesome stuff in it! Okay now lets just take a moment to talk about sound and graphics... they are so beautiful, yup that is all. Okay well I am done here I will leave you to find out more that this game has to offer if you decide to buy it. *cough* *cough* I really recommend this game even though it might update slow, but hey you can't hate to much they are a 4 man team. I think this game has potential out the roof!			",210,18,6,23,22,0,18

								Owned this game for ages and ♥♥♥♥ all has changed, even in beta, have a feeling this will never hit full version like the other madly over priced early access games that probably take our money to afford their jaccuzi partys and over priced champagne as they banter over us fools who pay £20+ for a whole bunch of nothing after being sucked in by a video over hyping the actual content and its promises. Think of this as just another no mans sky, not as in theres any actual lies i know about but despite having an enjoyable core this game is still giving you a price tag it knows it will unlikely ever be able to commit to. Dayz-like robbery. If this game does ever reach a full release just buy it then because itll probably have the same price tag, theres no way they could logically every charge even as much as they are now because its still over priced but now they have they excuse that youre paying to improve it, which you probably kind of are but at now decent rate.

								One of the biggest features in the current state of Overgrowth is being able to utilize its complex combat mechanics in its arena mode. This mode simply pits the player against one to three AI opponents, round after round, with the objective being not to die. Sometimes the round will be a 2v2, sometimes it’ll be a 1v1, and other times it’s a free-for-all. It is a perfect mode to highlight the most interesting thing about Overgrowth, the combat, and a wonderful place to refine the skills needed to comprehend what’s going on.			",21,1,0,2,9,0,2

								I've had this game for a long time now, and I still don't get bored with it. At this point, the game is pretty bare, but the potential is astounding, and the physics engine is phenominal; I don't think I've ever played in a better physics sandbox, actually. Combat is simple, but fast and fun. There's a stealth system, a weapons system, a massive array of easy to use world building tools, diverse character models, and the list goes on.Even in this early build, the game's combat can stand up to that of any action or figthing game out there. Since the player's power level is the same as each NPC, the game quickly becomes about skill and coordination, and in that aspect the game is very rewarding. You'll never find an opponent that you can't take on, and the only thing limiting your advancement is yourself.Oh, and the game also has a really fun parkour system. Overall, Overgrowth is ♥♥♥♥ing fun, and is my favorite Early Access game. Totally worth the $30 price tag. I can't wait to see how it turns out.(08/21/2014)EDIT: My Steam notes that I only have 2 hours on record for this game. In fact, I've owned the game for longer than it's been on Steam, and have only recently begun launching the game via Steam. Because, you know, manual patching is dumb.			",199,23,3,28,11,1,25

								This game is in very early alpha and I will review it again later. This game will soon be the sequel to the game Lugaru, a full campaign you should check out. For the moment, you can only play pre-made levels such as Dropping In, Gladiatior, Two Bunnies Enter, One Bunny Leaves, etc. This game caught my eye, mainly because of the fact that there were bunnies in it, and I love bunnies SOO MUCH! Let's get on with the review.Story: 0/10   Overgrowth at the moment has no storyline but is bound to have one in the full release... at least some missions in later builds. I will change this section when that happens though.Graphics: 7/10   This game has beautiful landscape, amazing artstyle, and cool charactor designs. The blood could look a little more realistic, though.Mechanics: 9/10   The mechanics and programming of the game is great. There are a lot of things to do such as Climbing, Rolling, Aerial Attacks, Sweeps, Dodging, Ninja Crouching, Throwing bunnies over your shoulder, Throwing bunnies over your shoulder and then curb-stomping them (which is SO satisfying), and much, much more.Controls: 9.5/10   There's really nothing wrong with the controls. 1-9 changes your player model, jump then hold RMB to cling to ledges (sometimes it flings you upwards then you ""accidently"" roll and satisfyingly break your neck), LMB attacks, Shift to roll, and other basic controls. I would have given it a 10/10, if it weren't for the ""hold [W,A,S, or D] then you do this [Random attack that never works]"" bs.Overall: 8.95/10   As you can tell, this is an amazing game. Not a lot of content, but it is still in early access (As of 2/16/2014), so that can change.			",176,14,0,8,11,0,2

								Owned this game for ages and ♥♥♥♥ all has changed, even in beta, have a feeling this will never hit full version like the other madly over priced early access games that probably take our money to afford their jaccuzi partys and over priced champagne as they banter over us fools who pay £20+ for a whole bunch of nothing after being sucked in by a video over hyping the actual content and its promises. Think of this as just another no mans sky, not as in theres any actual lies i know about but despite having an enjoyable core this game is still giving you a price tag it knows it will unlikely ever be able to commit to. Dayz-like robbery. If this game does ever reach a full release just buy it then because itll probably have the same price tag, theres no way they could logically every charge even as much as they are now because its still over priced but now they have they excuse that youre paying to improve it, which you probably kind of are but at now decent rate.

								One of the biggest features in the current state of Overgrowth is being able to utilize its complex combat mechanics in its arena mode. This mode simply pits the player against one to three AI opponents, round after round, with the objective being not to die. Sometimes the round will be a 2v2, sometimes it’ll be a 1v1, and other times it’s a free-for-all. It is a perfect mode to highlight the most interesting thing about Overgrowth, the combat, and a wonderful place to refine the skills needed to comprehend what’s going on.			",21,1,0,2,9,0,2

YouTube™ Video: Overgrowth - In Progress 

			Views: 131		

			Hello there person of the internet! New to this channel maybe subscribe! Brief Description I know what you're thinking, whoa, whoa, whoa mister Clever this game is still in development.		

Okay well let me start by saying that I am already hooked on Overgrowth! (Well I have been for a while now, I have owned before it was on Steam. So please ingnore my steam hours I have many more on the SUMlauncher.) So this game has a little bit of everything that is needed for a fun action game, good combat, nice controls, and character diversity. These things all then blend together to make this game enjoyable to play. It also has a pretty kickin' editor for map making, you can even make your own little mission if you felt like it then you could upload it to the modding community which might I add has some awesome stuff in it! Okay now lets just take a moment to talk about sound and graphics... they are so beautiful, yup that is all. Okay well I am done here I will leave you to find out more that this game has to offer if you decide to buy it. *cough* *cough* I really recommend this game even though it might update slow, but hey you can't hate to much they are a 4 man team. I think this game has potential out the roof!			",210,18,6,23,22,0,18

								You know the first matrix where in that scene Neo is learning King fu and jujitsu by having fighting simulations and programs being uploaded in his brain, well this is probably one of the many programs Neo had to learn to master his bullet biting reflexes. Literally.  Actually the program might have been Lugaru realistically as Overgrowth was obviously not around back then. (I don't think Lugaru either was back then but close enough though). By the way, the game now feels complete. Since the last update which included the full Lugaru campaign redefined, there's nothing more that I really want.  Everything seems polished to me. Oh and one more thing. Dev's, you can drop the early access thing. Seriously. It's been like years since release.			",82,13,0,13,7,0,6

								(I ripped this straight from my facebook so)Look, I know I'm the indie person and all that. But I'm going to do an honest to goodness sales pitch here. It's for an amazing title that I have been following for a long time. Overgrowth by Wolfire. (http://blog.wolfire.com/2014/01/Overgrowth-a205-video-changelog) blog here.This is a Third Person fighting game with a key focus on ninja rabbits.The fighting is very bushido-blade esque. As in, each fight is a challenge. You will feel on the edge of your seat and you never quite know what will happen next. Not to mention, each fight is very free form.Fighting an enemy with a sword? You can either stab them with it, or while they are charging you, throw the damn sword at them. However, this is where the game gets interesting. Most AI nowadays would just eat the spear and call it good. This AI however, is already sophisticated enough (In alpha mind you) to not only dodge the sword, but catch the sword, in mid throw, and then chase you with itEach fight is as dynamic as you want it to be. One of my favorites was I was in a free for all. (1v1v1v1) and it was down to me and the last enemy. He had me cornered, so using the games awesome parkour system, I ran up the wall, backflipped over the enemy, gave myself a space advantage, sweep his legs from under him and kicked him in his dumbass rabbit face.Another thing, as stated in his video in his blog, the dev states 'Its 2014, and I believe that people shouldn't have to restart their game in order to see graphic changes from the settings.' So if you switch your graphical settings, no restart needed. It happens in real time, and get this. Since the pause menu is literally just a popup box over the game, you will get to see the changes happen.Now, here is where a lot of people would be like ugh no.It is still an EARLY alpha. Like I'm talking command prompt boots from it. It still is kinda crashy, and its 30.00.But trust me, this is a great investment. And you get a free game of Receiver from it.The dev is actively working on it, posting constant updates on his blog with youtube videos describing what changes in every patch.This is worth the 30.00 investment, trust me.

								The devs just released the entirety of Lugaru HD (assets+code) as open source.That alone deserves my respect and support.And Overgrowth (this sequel) is a much improved engine full of interesting possibilities.Even though it doesn't have the ""local multiplayer"" stamp/tag on steam, it actually supports local split-screen mode in a few small arena-like maps, which is actually fun to try with a friend.

								Be aware this is not a definitive review due to Overgrowth still being in alpha and not complete, these are just my thoughts on the game so far and what I have experienced with it. I had never even heard of Overgrowth until it came to steam only recently and it had been in development years before it even came to steam. I quickly became curious and watched videos on it online to see what the fuss was all about. This game has the potential for greatness. Overgrowth is a third person action game that has some of the most impressive physics combat I've seen. For an independently made game It is an absolute blast to get into a brawl with enemies and come out on top. However with the game being in production it isnt really a game... You see, when you log in to the menu it gives you a variety of premade maps to mess about in. There is no single player story to be had and there are some challenge modes that are very lack luster. However once you choose a map there is an ingame editor that lets you spawn objects, enemies and tweak with the games settings sort of like Little Big Planet. This is where things get interesting. You can create different senarios to the existing maps and can even share your creations online with other players and friends. It is a bit of an ordeal to do this as you have to sign up for the developers fourms and other time comsuming methods to get it working properly. However once it is done you never have to do it again and it is painless from there on out to share your work. I have to admit the price tag for an unfinished game is hard to justify, but this is purely a chance for the developers to show people their game and to promote it. I think Overgrowth has some great ideas to become an awesome game and It is worth to give it a shot. Not only will it help an independent game developer but give this game the attention it deserves.			",13,1,0,2,0,0,0

								When it works it's good, messy fun. It's a very early alpha and the content is minimal but it loads so fast that you can just jump in and out whenever you feel like it. It's also extremely graphic because of how the damage system works. You don't have HP, you have a skeleton that can be broken.From watching people play you would think that it has a complicated control scheme but it couldn't be simpler. Left click is attack and right click is block. The combat reminds me of Assassin's creed but less one-sided toward the player. The AI stands a chance against you. In fact, You're going to get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you more often than not at first.Great fun. I look forward to watching it grow.			",112,25,8,9,13,0,8

								This game is sooooooooo good.I know it is only alpha and a lot of games are releaseing too early in development to get enough money to keep funding the games they are making but I would still recommend this. It isn't fully optimised and i will refrain from saying it is okay as it is only an alpha but the rest is good. Controller support that runs smoothly into 2 player co-op whether it is split screen or one camera.The combat is delicious and really requires thought and precision. You can even slow done time as to think about your moves carefully and to make cool cinematics. You can level edit and even play custom levels (You have to download them of other websites but it should be getting steam workshop soon).I don't normally give ratings out of 10 but if I had to I would give it a 9/10. This is because it is not perfect and still needs working on but on the whole is very fun to play, may just with a lack of content. :3			",126,23,1,15,15,2,18

								Overgrowth is a promising game with a lot of potential and is a game that as of right now is mroe or less a funding project, the game right now is more of an idea. In which you play as a humanoid rabbit and you brutally slaughter other humanoid rabbits, while the premise doesent seem much the game IS ALPHA and if you are lookin gto purchuse this game id reccomend you hold off for now. However if you simply cant wait, the game has a healthy level editing system as well as an interesting combat system, its parkour elements are also entertaing as well.			",205,23,0,16,12,0,7

								When you buy into overgrowth alpha you are buying into the snippits of what the game can become, your buying into the fantastic lore and world of overgrowth and the unrivled raw talent behind it. One of my faviorite universes in current indie games. The comics and art really drive a story (and i'm not really into comics but these I do read) in what eventually I would imagine a dynamic and interesting world full of unique characters and gameplay. the melee combat engine in my opinion is unrivaled in this games alpha releases and i'm sure WG will use it to its full advantage when creating the game. with the ammount of effort and time dedicated by the developers and artist in one of the original fathers of crowdfunded indie games im sure this isnt going to be a one trick pony game i would imagine the story to be ever continuing or other storys evolving around it or the prospects of some kinda player driven gameplay who knows ?

								This game, man.This game.Although that should be enough of an argument to go and buy the damn game, you may want reason.The graphics are very good, in their own special ways. When you are bashing another rabbits head into the floor, the sunset behind you will encourage you to destroy all rabbits. The combat system is fast. I mean LIGHTNING fast. If you are a quarter of a second too late on a block, you will get hit. The swords are powerful and almost always kill in one hit (as in real life). The combat system is the best I've seen, and since the game is in alpha, it is still getting improved.And to find more maps, download SUMLauncher. It helps a lot.			",22,1,0,1,2,0,0

The best part of overgrowth is not the great combat scheme or the parkour it's the music and scenery wether you want to go to the arena and fight or run around and find (literal) Easter eggs this adventure is one that by most gamers is not to miss.

								Update: they finally ported the Lugaru campaign ! This is awesome !I was a big fan of Lugaru, like, played hours and hours of it, did every single campaign, official or not, that I could find, installed countless mods...And then I came across his successor. Had to try it. So, after watching several alpha updates and a few reviews, I decided that that game was even more worth a shot because of the greatly improved graphics and ragdolls.And I'm totally not disappointed.Alright, it's an alpha, it's in development, there's no campaign yet, there are still a few bugs... But I love it.Tons of fun, just walking/running/parkouring the maps, fighting countless enemies in the arena, playing like a ninja, using dozen different weapons, installing every single cool mod I can find and creating maps, characters and new things.Will probably love it even more when it will be finished.1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play			",125,9,17,13,9,0,6

								My god. I think I just crapped my pants over how awesome this is. Be ready to see some awesomeness.Review starting in 3..2..1..  Overgrowth is a game full of fantastically awesome awesomeness, with some excellence and fabulousness on top. With that, the developers added in some more micro-awesomeness plasmoids, making this game more irresistably and inevitably awesome. The animation itself is scary realistic (for giant ninja bunnies,) and the blood animation makes me happy. Here in the helpful reviews section, you'll find it full of awesomeness and smart people. Don't go to the unrecommended, or you'll find the opposite of these smart people. I want to write a reveiw which you don't have to sit for 3 hours here and still give you the gist: Get this game it's awesome in every way and it's full of greatness and if you are looking for a game worthy of buying buy this one because later it will be too expensive and it auto updates and all your friends (if you have any) will have this game and and you won't and you'll go cry in your room alone while everyone else has fun and your friends will all hate you, your girlfriend will leave you (if you have one) and your parents will disown you and probally have you killed ALL BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET THIS GAME!

								I like this game a lot, event though it's still very much in developement, it's still enjoyable. I always enjoy finding games that have some new twist to them and this is one of them. It's a game about kung-fu rabbits,as a like to say (eventhough it has dogs, rats, cats, and wolves also). though it lacks in super combo moves, ang the ability to shoot lasers, and what not that you might see in other games, you know which ones i'm talking about that say theyre all about martial arts and such, but honestly, im happey this game lacks in that stuff. it keeps it real... or at least as real as ""kung- fu bunnies"" gets. This game really stands out to me for a few things, it's fighting with phisics, sceletal structure, parkour, dynamic AI, how damage is shown, armed combat vs hand to hand, and last but not least the ears. Now when I say that this game keeps it real, i mean really real. I say this because of the fighting with phisics I mentioned. what this meants is that when you get hit, its not a set amount of damage that is done, its all in how you get hit, where you get hit, what you get hit into etc. and they do an outstanding job with this. for example, lets say that some one punched you in the arm, of course you arent going to die, if they punch you in the leg you will probaably be fine, but once they hit you in the head chances are, you're going to die. Also  moving into to sceletal structure at the same time, if they do hit you in the arm or leg enough, it will break that bone and you will be considered defeated. also like i said what you get hit into, if you get round house kicked in the side, you might be able to roll it off, but if you get round house kicked into a wall you're taking some damage from the kick and that much more from the wall therefore doubleing your damage and potentialy causeing your enemy to hit something critical and most likely defeating them. Also, parkour was a great addition thanks to some of the things you can do. You can wall run, do flips over stuff, ledge grab just about anything you should be able to,  and more. this is great in combat if you use it well, for example, if someone is chasing you, you can wall run up the wall, jump off (even do a flip off of it if you're feeling styleish ;P)grab a ledge pull yourself up and fluip off and ""leg cannon"" your enemy. also what sets this game appart is the dynamic AI. in this game, if you dare button mash, you are almost guarenteed to lose, if you just keep swinging at your enemy you will lose, if you never throw a punch, you will lose. The AI will learn any patters you make or tendencies of yours and will adapt, you must continuously change your fighting style and mix things up or else, chances are, the AI will catch on. Moving on tho combat and how damage is shown more.most of the time, damage isn't shown. you just have to guess, but often times there is some blood you can see dribble down you character and drip (bonus point to that because, you dont always bleed the same way) although it's easier to tell with armed combat vs unarmed, in unarmed since it's all blunt damage it's almost impossible to tell whereas in armed combat, unless you get hit with a dagger it's a instakill. with daggers it may take a few swings (depending how you use it).  If you do get hit by a dagger, it's easier to judge damage due to showing externally, you can get scratched just about anywhere and it will show, also if heavily damaged, your character may go slightly limp and grasp his chest/ the injury. my point is, it's realistic how it show damage, you cant always see it but sometimes it thows up quite well, but unlike some games, it wont show up the same way every time. then moving on to combat a little more, theres armed and unarmed, for both you can parry/ block or counter hits, you can perform stealth kills, etc. unlike most games though, any weapon you hold you can throw it aty your enemy, and if theyre good enough they can catch it (and vise versa). However armed combat for he most part is hit block hit block, for unarmed it's a bit more interesting such as something that goes: you punch, enemy counters by pulling your arm in attempt to flip you on your back, you then notice this and counter by pulling your arm back and return the favor with a punch to the head, but you were too slow and they ducked and kicked your legs out from under you, you are critically hurt but prevent furtherdamage by rolling it off, the enemy then tries to kick you again but you grab his leg and flip him backwards, before the enemy can recover from being thrown onto the ground you curb stomp them and end the fight. this is the awesome combat in the game in addition to the parkour type stuff I said before. lastly, like I said, the ears. this is really small but I love it, little things like ears or tales move and flail in accordance to witch way you move. To wrap this up I would like to appologise for this giant unatractive wall of tet, typos and all. I highly recomend this game, get it when a sale comes but it is the finest hand to hand combat I have experienced in a game to this day (unless im totally blanking out wich I doubt). It's still in developement but its still very enertaining. (and if you're up for a challenge fight and revieve your enemies so they are even more adapted to your strategies).			",169,30,5,15,15,1,16

								While it is true that this game has been in Alpha since 2008, what the game has even now still makes it worth the price. The game revolves around very fast and heavily physics based combat where bunnies and other animals kick the crap out of each other. The reason why the game is about animals is because with humans the game was deemed ""too violent"", so that gives you an idea of how bad you can slaughter your foes here. Unfortunately, you won't be tearing out entrails or decapitating heads, but the blood is realistic and unlike other games which simply ragdoll you randomly when you take too much damage or trigger an animation when you die, this game has everything down to the calculations. It actually feels realistic when you get hit in the face, or when you get a cleaver pitched into you. The only downside I see is that unless you download some custom maps, the default ones are very boring. Downloading the custom maps solves this issue though because there are just heaps of them and some are actually very well made. All in all, 9/10.EDIT: It has been a long♥♥♥♥♥time since I bought this game, and from what I can say, it's nowhere near finished, despite it being in development since 2008. However, keep in mind, for a game as advanced as it is, Wolfire consists of 4 people. I have a long life in front of me, and one day, I hope that this game comes out to be the legend that it is destined to be. Honestly, I was reminded of this game when Nerdcubed, one of the youtubers that really introduced a lot of people to Overgorwth, released a video with the title, verbatim, ""Overgrowth... 6 years later"". I was seriously blown away to have realized that his original video had come out that long ago. Still, I immediately rushed to this game to see what had changed, because it had been ages since the last time I played it. The first thing I will address is the most major change: lugaru, the story mode.LUGARU.Pros:+Finally some levels with a ♥♥♥♥ing point+Does offer a story of some kind+This is what the big curtains are unveiling for, as in this will be the magnum opus of OvergrowthCons:-Story writing demands a whole lot-Finished this in about 3 days (not as in it took me 72 hours, I mean in short increments I played the lugaru over 3 days)Overall, lugaru is a very rough outline. Nothing much. However, the arena mode still exists, and the maps for it have been upgraded (there was a water arena which had less detail than minecraft, now it has been revamped and looks like a fairy came by and sprinkled some magic dust on it).  Still, arena is just as good as it was. My one criticism is that it has become insanely hard to reach the sandbox mode, or as I should actually call it, ""open world selector mode"". In the older Overgrowth builds, the main mode (disregarding arena) was the level editor. It worked in a way that you would have preset worlds which you could spawn models and props into, as well as entities and what not. This is how you would make custom levels. However, I can't find it. Actually, I can, but it has been made harder to use because to choose a preset, you don't have a thumbnail anymore, you instead scroll through the game's level files and trial and error your way to the desired preset. All in all, it's still got it. However, one thing I must address, the main criticism against this game is how long it has been in development. If you're going to invest in this game, you've gotta ♥♥♥♥ing believe with all your heart in Wolfire, because ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on these 4 people working their asses off isn't going to get you a game faster. You've gotta support these people for every ♥♥♥♥ing year it takes, whether it'll take another decade or 6 months. You need to believe like hell if you're going to buy this that one day it will come out in all its glory.			",83,7,0,3,4,1,0

								I really enjoy this game, I love the mechanics and the brutal combat, the story could use a little bit of a touch up (as there is none). But the one major issue I have with the game is that I can't seem to get rid of the large amounts of lag that I'm getting. I have all the miniumum and recommended software, and I'm running on the lowest possible graphics, but I still have a max framerate of about 5-7FPS and a delay of about 1.7 seconds between moving my mouse and my screen moving ingame. Other than that, keep up the good work!			",45,6,0,12,6,0,2

								This game kinda sucks. If you don't know how to program every little detail of a game, don't buy it. The only thing saving this is the hilarity of ther body physics, but don't take that as a complement any game can have funny body physics. For the price that this game demands it's an absolute must-not-buy. Along with the campaign it makes it a little more cancerous.2/10			",110,22,0,23,27,2,18

								Be aware this is not a definitive review due to Overgrowth still being in alpha and not complete, these are just my thoughts on the game so far and what I have experienced with it. I had never even heard of Overgrowth until it came to steam only recently and it had been in development years before it even came to steam. I quickly became curious and watched videos on it online to see what the fuss was all about. This game has the potential for greatness. Overgrowth is a third person action game that has some of the most impressive physics combat I've seen. For an independently made game It is an absolute blast to get into a brawl with enemies and come out on top. However with the game being in production it isnt really a game... You see, when you log in to the menu it gives you a variety of premade maps to mess about in. There is no single player story to be had and there are some challenge modes that are very lack luster. However once you choose a map there is an ingame editor that lets you spawn objects, enemies and tweak with the games settings sort of like Little Big Planet. This is where things get interesting. You can create different senarios to the existing maps and can even share your creations online with other players and friends. It is a bit of an ordeal to do this as you have to sign up for the developers fourms and other time comsuming methods to get it working properly. However once it is done you never have to do it again and it is painless from there on out to share your work. I have to admit the price tag for an unfinished game is hard to justify, but this is purely a chance for the developers to show people their game and to promote it. I think Overgrowth has some great ideas to become an awesome game and It is worth to give it a shot. Not only will it help an independent game developer but give this game the attention it deserves.			",13,1,0,2,0,0,0

								Overgrowth is an interesting game you are a rabbit who has to fight other rabbits. Of course this game is still in progress but that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it. The best part of overgrowth is not the great combat scheme or the parkour it's the music and scenery wether you want to go to the arena and fight or run around and find (literal) Easter eggs this adventure is one that by most gamers is not to miss.

								Actually, I wanted to give the game a thumbs up, but then i realised important tools are missing. This isn't a “early access game"", it's a sandbox, the game is missing. To get the ""game"" in this sandbox you need the launcher (external program) and mods from other users. So what is the Problem? It’s behind a closed forum… no thanks. Integrate the Launcher and mod support right from the start. You have put your game on steam, also you have the responsibility to support it for steam users. Have a look at the other modding communities, are they closed to puplic? You call it ""A secret forum"", so my thumbs up its secret, too. Until then: thumbs down			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I really enjoy this game, I love the mechanics and the brutal combat, the story could use a little bit of a touch up (as there is none). But the one major issue I have with the game is that I can't seem to get rid of the large amounts of lag that I'm getting. I have all the miniumum and recommended software, and I'm running on the lowest possible graphics, but I still have a max framerate of about 5-7FPS and a delay of about 1.7 seconds between moving my mouse and my screen moving ingame. Other than that, keep up the good work!			",45,6,0,12,6,0,2

								This game kinda sucks. If you don't know how to program every little detail of a game, don't buy it. The only thing saving this is the hilarity of ther body physics, but don't take that as a complement any game can have funny body physics. For the price that this game demands it's an absolute must-not-buy. Along with the campaign it makes it a little more cancerous.2/10			",110,22,0,23,27,2,18

								I think this is a great game and if a campaign comes out for it, it will be so kickass but WARNING WARNING: This game is not very optimized so it is very diffucult to run on out dated or cheap computers. I found this out cause I recently had a decent laptop and it could play this game only when in slow-motion mode but my new computer is a monster power computer and it still cannot run the game on full graphics. Great game though and I have a lot of fun with it I suggest getting the game cause it deservers the money and time and respect.I do wish to point out though that there is no difficulty setting so you will be put up against relentless bots who wish nothing more to kill you. I personally hate that cause you get zero breathing room and the combat in this game is just left up to pure spam of buttons. I can't get a beat on the enemies due to their unlimited combos and speed that the attacks are pumped out at. They never stand back for a bit and wait for you to attack. There is almost ZERO STEALTHING in this game which is idiotic considering your supposed to be a rabbit ninja. The enemies spot you from miles off and you can't hide from them no matter how far you get away from them. I enjoy this game but it gets repetative, hard, rage inducing, and above all tedious and annoying due to the fact that the enemies are all ♥♥♥♥ING IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT MOST OF THE TIME!!!

								So i have not put long into this game but i can say it is an amazing game for where it is right now. it has been in development for almost 10 years and has only recently come into Beta .The combat system is AMAZING. it is not based off of health, it is based of a skeletal structure. you can kill yourself by jumping and rolling at the right time, it snaps your neckThe parkour is good but controls are a a bit clunkyI would definitley reccomend this game if you like parkour and good combat ",118,23,0,8,15,0,6

								As is, it feels more like a demo than a full game. It's early access game so the lack of content isn't unexpected, but it's been like this for a very long time now and $30 feels like a steep price for what you get.Combat's fun, but it has a huge learning curve and you have to rely a lot on stealth (which means skipping combat entirely) if you don't want it to be Dying Simulator 2017.The parkour system is where the game really shines.  Your character is extremely mobile and has almost complete freedom in the game envrionment. If it looks like you can climb or leap over something, you probably can. Only problem is that the environments are really bare. It's typically just a small enemy camp, or group of enemies surrounded by a vast, empty plain/desert/etc.  It offers some nice variety for stealth missions though. If one approach isn't working, there's always five more you can try.The game could use a bit more of everything.  More weapons, more enemies, more ways to interact with enemies, more chapters, more varied chapters, more obstacles, more ways to interact with the environment, and so on. It feels like they have the basics down, they just need to add more content and tweak the difficulty.It's hard for me to recommend this at full price, but if you can grab it cheap (I got it as part of the Freedom Humble Bumble) it's worth checking out.

								I recommend this game, for people who want a change in games these day's, yes maybe this guy is taking too long for some people. But if you read his Twitter he's starting to pick up the pace and is soon going to hire more people, so far everything he's done in this game is pretty much superior to all these triple AAA games that create a new and super buggy game every year. The Core mechanics of the game are solid and he's obviously worked very hard to bring it from the ground up like this from scratch. I hate the talking down upon this amazing work he's done, I do agree Wolfire needs some new recruits if he wants to progress this game. Although it's taken a long time many mods give you plenty of more hours of this game and I've been designing my own map, character, and story; With the map editor and character action editors...                   But seriously, is really being negative about what he's doing the best option? Why not tell him that he's doing great with all these nice things, but these small little changes like ear twitches should not be the best thing to work on at the moment. What I say he  really should begin working on is the story, mechanics, physics, animation, and levels. I believe hiring people to work on the small stuff like minor bug fixes, small improvements, concept ideas, multiplayer, performance, and graphics. While the main developers can work on what's truly important, the story, level design, and gameplay. I believe we should start motivating David, because he is very talented in what he does but he needs support not negativety for making a amazing game from scratch. We just need to talk him into hiring people that he can trust to help him code, having a team of 10 could possibly durastically increase game production. So please hear me out when I say these things and think about it for a second and help us snap David out of the endless minor improvements so we can have a GREAT GAME!!*EDIT*                  Sadly as many as come to realize david has made no true efforts to impove his game to a state of ""bang for your buck"" in terms of it's still $30 dollars and there are many other games out there that have way more content, value and quality than this game can provide. I would call this a $10 dollar game at most. Seems like it will never make progress into a full game like I anticipated, with my hopes of a awesome game crushed due to procrastination and the pursuit of easy money; I will definitely take this game off my reccomended list many should do the same, so people aren't caught in a trap of this same excitement when they first see the game only to be punched in the mouth and get hardly any value for what the person paid. I do not reccomend this anymore.			",80,1,1,3,7,2,1

								Most negative reviews are people who cannot run the game or people who are tired of the game taking a long time to develop. I myself love this game and have had many hours playing it. I love this game and it is definitely worth your time. Watching the game develop is quite fun.Now alot of people hate the game for the fact that it has taken years to finish. The game is meant to be very big and will have many things. The devs add cool little things atleast 1 time a month (there are weeklyish updates and they add cool little features but there hasn't been new weapons or stuff added in a bit). The game is going to take a long time and there is a small dev team so hating the game for the reason it is taking a long time to develop is just stupid. If you want the finished game just buy it when it is done but you will be missing out on watching the game grow.Good game 10/10			",181,25,2,20,35,5,8

								Don't let my hours fool you, I've been playing this game for a lot longer than it has been on steam, I made the purchase on steam to support the dev. The combat is fantastic. I've always enjoyed high speed, agile high octane melee combat like what this game includes. The thing is, the game (last I knew) only has one developer. On top of that, the asking price of 29.99 is a little too high. Currently all this game includes is a fun combat game where you can sort of design the levels yourselves and make up your own mock campaign. So please keep this in mind that while you're looking at this game for purchase.  It's incredibly fun, but please be aware of what it includes before you purchase it.If you guys can, please upvote my review so that others are aware of what the game is before they purchase it. Buyers remorse sucks, and this game deserves to be seen for what it is. A great game, but don't expect a campaign or storyline at this time.Edit: At this time, there is a sort of hashed campaign mode as well as local vs mode. Still not a lot of content for $30 at this time but it's been changed in the last year.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It seems a lot of people are unhappy with the development of this game. However, for me, it is more fun to play than any other 3D fighting game at the moment, and I wouldn't mind waiting a couple years for the full release. For being mostly made by ONE person, with the addition of an artist and composer helping out, this is an almost completely independent project. After knowing this aspect, the idea of a game taking 8 years to get into Beta should make a little more sense. The engine and combat have both changed drastically over the years, and even from 2014 to now I can see a difference. The development is no where near ""non-existent"". If you look at the Wolfire Games Youtube Channel, an update is posted every few months. Before buying this, just be aware you are not buying a full game, and that if you do patience will need to be a virtue, because one person is working on this, without any extra help fixing bugs, making a new campaign, polishing, or anything. Hope this can clear things up for some people.			",84,7,1,5,2,0,1

								This is definitely one of the best games I've ever played, although it's only in alpha and probably has another year before release it's incredibly fun with arena, pvp (on same pc) and sandbox gameplay.If you enjoy playing Mount&Blade then you might want to check this game out, it follows a similar system except much more advanced and fast paced.Brilliant game I'd easily give it a 9/10, can't wait for the full version to come out :3			",122,14,10,8,19,3,20

								I originally got this game from Humble bundle a couple years ago and have been following its development for even longer. a Kung-fu rabbit game just sounded so cool and is. Id still say its in early development even after all this time (In part to devs losing focus for other project; Low light combat and reciever) but its still well worth your time and money just from the content available right now. Full access to the editor and a number of levels already exist with the community having provided even more. Highly suggest checking it out.			",391,50,7,47,10,2,32

								An Indie game i found about 2 years ago, by the devs of the infamous humble bundle, the game is currently is alpha stage, so buyer beware, i bought it 2 years ago aswell, just seeing the steam release is refreshing, the game is really fun, and enjoyable, thought it might not be your cup of tea, for x amount of reason. pros - fun brawler style game- community driven - some assets in game are from players.- sweet combat style- only in alpha atm (it can only get better!)cons - No online multiplayer as of yet (maybe)- only in alpha- fur♥♥♥♥.- medium learning curve for gameplay/createrall in all, for a game in the alpha stage, its really fun, my friends come over and we duel each other, and mess around with the parkour/physics. after looking at the pictures, and videos, and you think you'd enjoy it, do it. most times, your gut isnt wrong.

								Overgrowth is a very unique game being developed by Wolfire Games, it features Rabbits, Cats, Dogs and Wolves doing parkour and fighting brutally with weapons and hand to hand. It is an amazing game and it features alot of community content including characters, maps and mods. I highly recommend this game to everyone, but be warned, the game is still in alpha and therefore has some bugs and it is definately an unfinished and unpolished game, but, if you dont mind that you should buy it now.

								30 minute experience: It starts off looking cool. I'm greeted with a very nice looking options menu to optimize my graphics. I just decide to jump right on into the tutorial. All is well, until they bring in the combat. Now, I'm no stranger to hand to hand combat in games, and I like a challenge, but it is safe to say that I would have rather been waterboarded with lemon juice than try to fight any of the enemies in this game. The damage is so high, and it is so easy to ragdoll, that it almost becomes impossible to fight. As soon as the dummy in the tutorial could hit me, I was flying around as much as a popped sex doll after sucking the dummy's♥♥♥♥♥♥ That was just the tutorial. I slowly pick up the combat and make it through the tutorial and the games main mechanics. I get into the story mode and I'm introduced to 2 ""sibling"" like sisters to the protagonist. I put sibling in quotes, because I accidentally skipped all the dialog by clicking too fast. None of the NPC's move and one of them points out this random♥♥♥♥♥hare standing off in the distance. I walk up to him, a dialog starts, and I am immediately turned into a puddle for the next 5 tries of trying to get this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out of my small village. I'm already unhappy with my experience by this point, but I keep going. Somebody leads me away from the town so I can ""take care of the scout base"" (obviously a trap) and then I proceed to get ♥♥♥♥ed in holes that the hares made. Because there is two of them, I get ♥♥♥♥ed twice as fast. As soon as I hit the ground from one or the other, their friend comes over and stunlocks me to where I die. I went through 7 levels of this♥♥♥♥♥♥and by the time I was done, it looked like my character could have been Guts from Berserk.This game is awful and I wouldn't recomend it to anybody. There is little immersion, combat is awful, and the mechanics are so bland, they could have made more money by making it a flash game on kongregate.com or coolmathgames.com 3/10			",117,23,3,37,12,1,12

								It seems a lot of people are unhappy with the development of this game. However, for me, it is more fun to play than any other 3D fighting game at the moment, and I wouldn't mind waiting a couple years for the full release. For being mostly made by ONE person, with the addition of an artist and composer helping out, this is an almost completely independent project. After knowing this aspect, the idea of a game taking 8 years to get into Beta should make a little more sense. The engine and combat have both changed drastically over the years, and even from 2014 to now I can see a difference. The development is no where near ""non-existent"". If you look at the Wolfire Games Youtube Channel, an update is posted every few months. Before buying this, just be aware you are not buying a full game, and that if you do patience will need to be a virtue, because one person is working on this, without any extra help fixing bugs, making a new campaign, polishing, or anything.

								This game has potential. The combat can feel good when it actually feels like it's working. And the sound design is pretty good, it's very fun to jump around and do what limited platforming there is in the game. Mostly it's just hilarious to see weird anthropomorphic freaks flip around and break their own necks. It's definitely not worth thirty bucks, especially when it looks like it will never be finished.

								Time to face the facts.. They've spent 8 years perfecting the engine and in their first update in around a year they're discussing whether or not they should change the engine..This      is       never      going      to      be      finished.At least The Stomping Land developers never gave us the illusion they were still working on it.

								firstly, ignore my hours. i exclusively been using the SUM launcher. also be aware that this game is unfinished, poorly opimized, and plagued with slow updates.. (though the developer is starting to get more manpower to speed things up a bit) i have to advise anyone who doesn't know exactly what they are getting to not buy this game until you've researched what the game in its current state has to offer. before you buy this game you have to be satisfied with whats already there. ive been running this game beautifully on my hp elite 8000 compaq, it has 4 gigs of RAM, a 244 watt PSU, an intel duo processor, and a geforce 730 2g DDR5 card. if you have a better set up than me you'll probably be able to handle the bigger, more detailed maps you can get from the SUM launcher community mods, but please note. experience may vary.now the game play is where it all comes together, the parkour is fun, combat challenging and brutal, weapon play is excelent and amount of customizability the editor gives you is wonderful. the editor itself is a bit wonky, and using the editor to create levels/scenarios is where you will face 90% of your crashes. its pretty annoying, but i recomend saving the level after every major change, and when your fps starts to drop in editor to save every single change after that. once you save the level it will load automatically when you pick the level you saved it on. (which is nice) it reminds me of gmod, to get the most out of solo play you have to take the time to set everything up, both games (at least for me) tend to crash alot when doing this, but in the end the game play on your custom level is enough to justify it all. tl;dr 8.2/10 dont buy blindly			",107,12,1,6,12,0,16

								While the game mechanics are indeed unique, using only attack and block, the game is still in its development stage (always witht the loom of cancellatioin). However, the developers have becomre more active recently in their transparency with the game development, so at least the consumers know that it's not abandoned (yet).All in all, simple game with lots of potential, but slow (yet steady) progress			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Note:Like many of the other negative reviews on Steam, I want to preface my review by saying that I loved Lugaru, and think Overgrowth - even as it is now - is fun, and I hope it'll be a finished product one day.Actualy Review:That being said, the only question Steam reviews should answer is: do you recommend buying the game? The thing is, I really don't.I bought Overgrowth years ago, and even though a lot of work has been put into it since, it's very much the same game I played back then. It looks better, has more character models, better UI, all that good stuff. BUT it still doesn't have any substance. It's not a sequel to Lugaru, it's a sandbox tech demo, where you can play around with the Overgrowth engine. And to be fair, the Steam store description and Early Access information both make this very clear.I have no doubt that if Overgrowth ever gets finished it'll be worth the $30€ price tag. But right now, I wouldn't recommend buying it. People interested in Overgrowth for what it is currently will  buy it regardless of my recommendation, but I think people looking for a game, should definitely wait, unless they're willing to think of the purchase as a pre-order with an undefined release date.A bit of perspective:Things that have happened while Overgrowth has been in development: Barack Obama get's elected president of the United States, Apple debuted the iPad, the first solar-sail tech demonstration is produced, Osama bin Laden is killed, Japan suffers the effects of a massive earthquake and a tsunami, the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform exploded in the Gulf of Mexico causing the worst marine enviromental disaster in US history, 3d printers and scanners enter the consumer market, mouse genome is fully sequenced, world population breaks the 7 billion mark, usb 3.0 is introduced, 22nm chips begin mass production, Curiosity is launched and lands on mars, I got married, got a job, lost the job, moved houses four times and learned to juggle. Overgrowth is the indie Daikatana. Except unlike Daikatana, Overgrowth when finished will be awesome, and not the most mediocre entry in its genre.			",925,302,25,81,67,14,104

All this slow development and lack of content would be fine for me if it were not for the game is pretty unplayable due to MASSIVE LOADING SCREENS i mean seriously you need a SSD if you want to load in and load out of this game regularly, for me it can take upwards of 10 minutes just to load the game, and then load a level (regardless on how small the level actually is).

There's no way the developer is doing anything about the game, because most of it is nothing, just some assets on the screen. Don't even start with ""It's EA, deal with it"".

								Right, I'm reviewing an early, EARLY alpha, Overgrowth is an action ""platformer"" with great combat and amazing animation, Overgrowth is going to be an open world fighting game, with quests.Let's talk about the pro's and consPro's:-Great combat, The combat is fast, brutal and very easy to get into and to master, if you like fighting a lot of bunnys with a large sword as an evil dog king, this is your game ;)-Amazing graphics, this game boasts amazing graphics, with procedural animation!-The dev team is very active and love to talk to the community, and take ideas!-It's Early alpha, WHICH MEANS, NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWW STUUUUUUUUUUUUFFFFFFFFFFFF-Fun gameplay, multiple maps from the community! great community who make items, charecters, maps and other things to help developmentCon's:-It hasn't got much content, yes, this game lacks content, it is Early Alpha which is why, so i recommend not buying this game if your looking for an amazing expierience, wait a little while until it has content, and more stuffOvergrowth is a fun expierience, even if it's an early alpha, it may not have content, but there is a lot of things to do thanks to map jams, from the community, new content added every month or so, fun gameplay, stunning graphics and great devsFor now i give overgrwoth 6.5/10 Piggy points ;3 this will be updated when the game is fully complete and i hope for it to be a 10/10 masterpiece!Here is a link to an underated Youtuber name Idubbbztv who does OverGrowth Videos showing off gameplay and maps/mods from the community!https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4USoIAL9qcsx5nCZV_QRnA ",65,2,0,5,3,0,1

								Just so you know, yes this game has been in production since 2005 when it was named Luguru 2 (which by definition even in Alpha state i believe it surpasses the first Luguru game). Within 2008 it was renamed to Overgrowth, and in 2011 released on steam. Yes....that's a long time to develop a game....but....note this. This IS NOT a AAA title nor is it made by professional developers. Wolfire is comprised of only 4 devs, and that's why updates come slowly and its still in early access. Also They are now moving to a new engine due to the crashes that is being complained about....Now this definately will take a while with only 4 devs. Now lets get back to talking about a triple A game....which is comprised of not just a single team...but multiple teams of Devs up to over hundreds of developers.....How do you think its capable for a CoD game to come out yearly? Plus in games like those they reuse mechanics and code to make  development easier. And NO this game is not abandoned.Now that we got that out in the open....lets look at some good'Ol PROS and CONS+Combat is unique and easy to get used to but not easy to win unless you cheat or....like to spam certain moves+Great ninja feel, and gravity and movement gives the game an old martial arts movie vibe to it.+Great Collisions+Local Co-op works well especially with multiple controller support+Level editing with every prop and tool in the game including materials, Ai, weapons and....other unique stuf+stealth and quest creator+Throw weapons at enemies xD+Multiple races to fight and play against from dog/wolf/rabbit/mouse/cat people +Endless Arena Mode (unless u die)+Great visuals good enough to enjoy, and fit the game itself.+Slow Motion button+Button that shoots a magical beam and insta kills everything (cheat attack as i said)+great ragdoll physics-Crashes (most occurring problem)-lag at times....depending on the total amount of data within a single area.-Long development process (Just be patient and enjoy what it gives)-Players just judge the game without understanding the situation or how development works >,> and ruins it for others-A lot of wasted reviews that don't provide any supportive information (just me angry right now xD )I should also point out there, that they plan on taking the campaign/story from Luguru and implementing it within this since......so far it doesn't have any....so that's something to look forward too after the engine transfer (Unreal Engine 4)They do keep us posted on twitter and other sites with Q/A's so please check that out if your interested. thanks for taking the time reading this and sorry for the grammar xD			",360,29,10,28,17,1,22

								Excellent sandbox, massive potential, Ninja Rabbit Combat.Edit:        Wow I can't believe that's all I wrote on this game. Probably because I was too busy playing it. I have more hours on this game offline because I use a community mod loader and launcher to play the game. Overgrowth is in development and has been percolating in the minds of the developers since 2005 when they dropped Lugaru, the spiritual predecessor as they put it to Overgrowth.       The reason I love this game is because of it's combat system. The lead developer mentioned once that he took inspiration from Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee movie fight scenes. I like mortal combat street fighter and every other game in that genre in their own rights, but combos for crazy moves put me off. The combat system in this game is based of attacking, blocking, countering, or dodging. The way you are moving around your target determines what kind of attack you will throw. To counter you have to press the block button which is the RMB or right trigger on game pad.You'll have to just watch the game played and see for yourself if you're interested. What drew me in was the combat and wall jumping! Also user generated content if you're interested in that kinda thing. It won't be as vital to the game when the developers add their mass of content. AND LORE!			",144,10,4,12,11,0,2

The rabbit shoots blood out of its neck and it drains down the mesh in real time. I guess that's a weird thing to recommend it for.I give up. In truth I just play it for the furry art.

								Overgrowth is still in its growing stage, but has a lot to show, like its unbelievably, amazing combat system. It IS the best around.  You can end enemies 1,000 plus ways and its great because you really cannot get bored with killing in the game after a little while. I heared that the engine for this game is lacking money but when you get the game, you'll thank yourself that your helping them with their game. The atmosphere of the gameplay is great, the maps are stunning, and the characters are pro postive.  Overgrowth, is a beastly combat game in the making.200/100			",47,5,0,7,4,1,2

And the big one I asked ""Why is it called Overgrowth"",hopefully we'll know soon.I hope that in future the game has some story added as well as some actual Friendly rabbits and such.It's fun to fight guys,but we need friends.Hell maybe even they could string all the maps together and make a pretty awesome world,or just have a sort of hub connecting the lands where you can travel to and from.So far I've only used and Xbox controller (which it supports) due to a broken mouse.And it all actually works really well.To Sum up it's 8.5/10, if you're into open world, combat or even parkour games,definitley give this a go.

								An updated Review, I thought I had wasted my money. Now with more devs on the team, more updates are pumped out. Most of them change the game, adding new maps and such. The one thing the irks me the most is the SUM launcher and how I have to go through a buch of Bs to get it. Also, please fix the local split screen. it goes into one tiny corner, and only the gamepad can look around. Otherwise, with the new skinned weapons that look kinda cool, this game has gotten better. The bugs are fixed, and it doesnt crash anymore yay!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Don't know that it's worth $30; but you can get it off a website that may include a G, a 2, and an A in the title for around $15. I had to remove the link/actual title because Steam isn't particularly fond of them. It's definitely a lot of fun if you can run it and like the combat, but updates haven't come too often and it's likely you won't see much more progress than what's offered here in the final release. However, that isn't to say it hasn't definitely been updated. It seems they have kicked up their efforts recently, as well, but I can't say much for sure. There's a lot more to the game than there was when it started off, including the fact that it is MUCH easier to run now. If you own the game and didn't like the way it ran before, I heavily recommend revisiting it. The game doesn't stretch very far past what you can see in the screenshots and trailer, but for a quick rundown, and things you should consider before buying:- The game features relatively quick, primarily hand-to-hand and melee fighting, with a very intricate movement system. There are many maps dedicated entirely to parkour. - The modding community is fairly sized, and extremely dedicated. If you own the game or plan on getting it, you should definitely download SUMLauncher for it as well. You can easily install and manage mods, as well as adjust advanced graphics settings, controls, etc. I consider it essential.- There are no current plans for multiplayer, though there is a decent mod for it currently in development. - The dev team is pretty small, and probably won't expand. As of the last few months, updates have come a bit more frequent, but just keep in mind that anything could happen to this game. Dev blog, keep up with the game here.[blog.wolfire.com] ",284,29,3,23,28,4,30

								*DISCLAIMER: Dont make the assumption that i dislike this game because it is different from main stream games, i quiet enjoyed it for the short time i played it* Much like goat simulator the easiest way to review a game like this is by making a list of things i like and dont like about it.1 (like): Unique battle controls.2 (like): You can play as other animals than a rabbit.3 (dislike): It is a very limited group of animals.4 (dislike): Strong parkour elements.5 (dislike): very poor stealth engine.6 (like): very few bugs for a early access game.7 (dislike): No unique art style.8 (dislike): Very poor AI. 9 (dislike): All weapons do absolutley devostating damage.10 (dislike): Suicide button that is easy to accidently hit.11 (dislike): Reset and respawn button that are very easy to hit on accident.12 (dislike): Many hidden buttons that can cause you to mess up. 13 (dislike): Of the bugs there are, they are very bad and can be triggered moderate ease.14 (dislike): mods are confusing to install if you dont know what you are doing.

								Ok im going to give a full review! Yes, it is pretty dumb that this game is still in alpha, but just because people who were dumb enough to get the game in its 1st launch hate it because they made the deicision to get a game NO WERE near beta, and probably before it was on steam doesent meen its bad! Thats why they probably dident release on steam for a long time. Well now i guess its near beta now, and NOW is the right time to get it. This game is fun, and the graphics are so amazing, ive never seen anything like this! So much special lighting effects and everything. The games controls are amazing too, there really responsive and it feels so satisfying to hit someone in the face with a giant broadsword, or getting that direct hit with the spear. In the game theres different types of animals to play as. Like wolfs have the most power, bunnys have the best parkour, cats are the best at stealth and the rats are good at camoflage i think and im not sure whats good about the dog i havent tried that yet. Also theres a really good level editor, my only wish about it is that i wish ading speech and poses was much easier.All together this is a really good game, but dont get it if you whant a fully fledged campaign,coz the game doesent have one yet!?/10 im not gonna rate it till its finished.

								This game is a great little parkour and fighting toy, however it's not that fun as a game. I don't really know weather or not I would call this a game. This has been in development for 6 years I believe and it feels like it's gotten nowhere. It kinda feels like a DayZ situation where the developers have pretty much given up. I could be wrong and they could be spending 9-5 every day working on this game, but I still can't justify £22.99 for this ""game"" perhaps some day it will be a great game but I don't see that happening anytime soon.

								Reviewed in current state: 22/1/2017 Could I be seen as crazy just because I got this game due to the fact that the presentation reminded me of the 1978 film Watership Down? Maybe but aswell being won over by the unique visuals this game actually has some very good meat on it despite being early access, The meat of the game comes in two forms the content and the gameplay. The Content is ok but a little bit on the shallow side, The training is vital for this game as it shows you how the mechanical cogs of the combat works while the simple Arena and Versus in my opinion actually complement the training as bot matches help you put to practice the things you learnt from training. ( especailly learning to avoid and counter knife attacks !) After a little refinement in these game modes you're ready for the most meaningful part of the content the campaign missionsThe campaign missions really are the best as they offer gameplay structure allowing you to use both stealth and combat together rather than just the combat, So how does one describe the Campaign? well although not quite fully to the letter the Tenchu series comes to mind, Yes Just like the Tenchu series from ps1 to TenchuZ on xbox360 this game holds the same satisfaction as despite very basic level and AI design you take great joy as you slowly figure out how to assassinate and not get overrun by the AI that comes before you. Its the mix of stealth and the very addictive combat that gives the game its heart and soul! . So In the end It's THIS gameplay aswell as the content that helps make the game so far a very small but also a very healthy piece of gaming satisfaction that I would recommend to anyone who loves both the art style and the Tenchu/ Ninja-est gamplay it offers.

If you want a complete game, I recommend it maybe 50 years later for the next proper update. Finally, unless they improve the maps, story, and performance. I DO NO RECOMMEND IT AT ALL!!!!!

								i think that this game had great potential but has seemed to be lost. A game is only as good as its developers. updates are slow which isnt bad its just the problem is the updates are small changes which shouldnt take 4 months. i realize that making a game is difficult but it is rediculous when a game takes this f*ckin long. I am sad to see my $30 go to waste. I have had many problems trying to install mods because when i go to the website it says i need to own the game which i already do.bugs i have encountered such as:crashes when trying to terrain carve (while using controller)the camera will auto look at dead bodies screwing up gameplaytextures are missing all the time (mainly the sky)saving does not work on all the maps (game crashes)final thought- This is a great game for 30 min than dies out and every 4 months a new alpha comes out but is not enough to play off of. do not buy this game.

								In my honest opinion, I do not recommend this game. It's very very fun at first but when you complete the campaign and spend alot of time in the arena and install mods it gets boring very fast, and I mean very boring. Plus the devs don't really give a crap about the game and the people who play it, they don't pay attention to what we the people really want in this game. If you really want this game and you don't care about what the reviews say, atleast wait until there is a sale on this game, 30 bucks for this game isn't worth it.			",65,7,2,9,11,0,2

								In my opinion the only thing is off with this game is it's long time in development. It has pretty awesome graphics on custom engine, so its still quite impressive what three people can do to make an amazing concept alive. Movement is great, combat is based on reflex, not button mashing. I like it. Characters are innovative, modding support is propably going to be huge. Still nothing about story though. Im curious what is that rabbits-wolves thing all about.Multiplayer features are propably going to be only avaible on shared screen as far as i know, but it's fault physics based gameplay, not developers way of thinking. Still one of my ""must have"". if you like new concepts, having fun with ragdoll, or huge human-like animals, AND you have enough money to spend, you should buy it. Seriously. just do it. its my first review so im sorry if i made any mistakes. also, feel free to like if it you like it. Peace :)			",132,16,1,11,15,1,21

								Let me start off by saying that this game gets infrequent updates and will probably get a full release after Half Life 3. Now that my only major negative point is out of the way, let me say that this game, in my opinion, has the best combat in any game that I have played so far. Instead of a health system, like most games have, the combat is based on a bone structure system, enemies' bodies will react realistically to being hit, and a single fight with one opponent can take quite a while, which might not be good for everyone, but it's something I really enjoy. You can perform various moves that you can figure out yourself, for example a jump kick, that allows you to bounce off enemies and sometimes land head-first on the ground and snap your neck. There are a few levels already in the game, along with some challenges and an arena, but there is a vast selection of custom maps for you to enjoy, all made with the in-game editor. The parkour, while hard to learn, is VERY satisfying once you are able to even perform some basic actions. This game is definitely not without its problems, but shows a lot of promise, especially considering that it's this fun while it's in alpha.			",154,22,2,24,16,1,26

								This review is based on the Overgrowth Alpha (3.January 2014): Right now Overgrowth is already much fun for players trying all of the mechanics. I personally got it because Nerdcubed did a Lets Play on Youtube on it. It looked like much fun playing with the sandbox and the new arena. Arena: The new arena gameplay is pretty dope. I love the fights without weapons, because you have to fully use all the mechanics in combat that your rabbot has. Also the polearm fights are awesome, I just throw it and then try to retrieve it while not getting killed. One vs One fights are too easy right now. Just jump towards them and kill them with a precise kick. Sandbox: The sandbox does not have a hughmangous amount of stuff to do, but it is fun and I enjoyed playing it. Play with the mechanics, build your own challenges and fight against an army of rabbits and wolves. Also it is possible to download custom made maps through the SUMLauncher (retrievable through the ""secret"" Overgrowth Alpha forum at Wolfire Games). Some of them are already great, some don't even launch on my computer. Much work to do, but awesome already. So if you're up for some fun and combat with a rabbit, this is cool. It's still an early Alpha, that is to be remembered while playing. But I think the developers are on a good way and this game will be great fun with a good story coming in the full customer version.			",142,18,5,18,23,2,24

								The game is excellent for combat and jumping around as a rabbit, but otherwise the game gets boring rather quickly due to no multiplayer, repetitive arena, and no real objective or story mode. What makes it worse is the fact that you need to spend 25+ dollars on the game, despite there being almost nothing to do. Wait for the game to finish and keep watching it, but don't buy it just yet.			",47,8,0,7,3,0,4

								Firstly, I bought this game along time ago, when it was alot cheaper (about £3.00) and have only played it throughout the months rarely, keeping an eye on its development.But before I will start to play this game as a game, not a gap filler, is when afew key things are added:1) Campaign/Story mode, I feel that if the game contained stories of Gladiators, Ninjas and Heros it would be incredible more enjoyable, rather then feeling no attachment to the win of a round.2) Multiplayer, Multiplayer campaign, Vs matches and Team Death Matches would be amazing, making the game feel more accessible and friendly. Not only this, it would increase sales as more poeple would be aware of this game and spread it around.Conclusion: As of now, I cannot recommend this game at such a steep price (over £20s), but if those described above are added... I would not hesitate to spend that amount on it.I may have only played afew hours but I have played many other games which contribute to my views, and also a game like this, in this current state, simply is not 'bash-able'.I hope this review helped - I may write another review is those mentioned above are added.

								I'm sure my grandkids will love playing the beta while they're in their retirement centers someday. Might even be able to get more than 20 fps on their beefy rigs too...In all seriousness, if you're reading this. Do Not buy this game. It should not have been put on steam in this early of a state.It's horribly buggy, most of it's features are broken, it crashes every time you try to change something in the settings, and they still haven't fixed the problem with the maps finding the texture files on a clean install.I had high hopes when i saw youtube videos of this game, but then i found out it took the recorders at least an hour just to get the damn thing running to film a 5 minute clip.It's developers like these guys and Sauropod Studio that have made us lose trust in Alpha backing, and rightfully so.

								Furry Fighter 20XX. The game is still in alpha and it was announced in 2008. It already has a lot of detail though, so I can imagine just how deep the rabbit hole could go. (Yes, that was a bad joke, I am sorry.)If you love mucking about fighting athropomorphic rabbits and wolves, then get this now. If you want less mucking about and more objective or story based gameplay, wait till this is fully released.			",249,57,0,24,18,0,22

								Overgrowth piqued my interest a long, long time ago. I forget where I first saw it, but I believe it was a website dedicated to showing off new indie ideals. Overgrowth became immediately interesting to me, being that it is a game about animals kicking each other in the face. However, with the myriad of other games on the market, I lost track f it until now.Let me preface this part by saying: if you can't handle a game with ALPHA BUGS and a game that ISN'T PERFECTLY OPTIMIZED, then this game is not for you. If you can deal with that, it comes with a ton of maps, and a pretty awesome editor. Though I have only scratched the surface, spawning 5-6 wolves in a map, and growing your rabbit character to the size of the Incredible Hulk, is immensely satisfying. The controls are solid, except for the few moments where you are going too fast or simply misjudging jumps. These end up being the most hilarious moments. Going for a jumping kick, and missing by a quarter-mile, then slamming into the wall---killing yourself. So all in all, would I recommend this game to everyone? Maybe. I looked over the game, and found it to be substantial enough to warrant a purchase. I like the developers attitude for the game, and I like where it is going. I mean come on, its the guys who do the Humble Bundle, so clearly they know the Indie market pretty well. However, if you don't like to spend a lot of time with a level editor, and need a guided campaign, then the arena mode is certainly not enough. If you do buy it, hopefully the community will figure out how to get the pre-order code for the secret forums from Steam. That place holds the key to all of the modding information, and bug/optimization suggestions.Just a note to close: I have run into some optimization ""issues"". Combat with 5+ seems to slow down quite a bit. I generally get 100-120 fps everywhere. Blood seems to really cause some issues on my rig. I am going to work on that next, and also I have noticed some buildings take a toll on the game. Also, make sure to map your shadows and ambient occlusion (and SAVE IT) because the game will constantly try to calculate it if you don't.			",141,2,2,12,6,2,6

								I love this game! Honestly, when anyone ever asks what my favourite game is, I will always answer ""Overgrowth""I understand that many people will be angered by the seemingly ""slow production"", however there are often updates every 2-3 months at most, though according to news, that will be dropped to 2 weeks, with small nightly updates.This games code is almost completely open, meaning that the modders have access to make the awesome mods that they do, because of this and the in game editor included, the whole thing becomes almost limitless even in its alpha stages. Some that are either in development or already released at the time of this message are; the bow and arrow mod (by Gyrth), the multiplayer mod OGMP (by Surak and Gyrth) and Therium 2 a , currently, 32 level campaign with full storyline, backstories, lore and exclusive items (by Timbles)Another great thing about Overgrowth is its community, the thousands of users on its forums are almost always happy to answer your questions and provide content and most posts are replied to within 30 minutes any issue you have is sure to be sorted on there (forums.wolfire.com) The SUMlauncher application is an unofficial add on that you can run alongside your game, it allows for update alerts, latest news from the development of the game, all the settings options, game reports and automatic downloads for all the best mods found on the forums. This only enhances what is currently available with the alpha.I would thoroughly encourage the purchase of this game, though quite bare in features in its initial state, the mods and community more than make up for what is missing(Before you buy, one downfall, this game requires OpenGL 3.2, this has become an issue for a few players rendering their game unusable including me. Alpha 209 is still playable without 3.2, but just in case, I suggest you check)			",71,4,1,3,3,0,2

								Despite it being in alpha for about 8 years, Overgrowth offers combat gameplay like non other. The fighting mechanic in this game is brutal and fast, and has this heavy sense of weight. The game features full body physics with ragdolls and collisions, and also features a myriad of weapons. Since the game is still far from complete, the devs allow you to mess around with many tools and different maps, as well as the newly updated Lugaru campaign as well as a challenge mode. Also, the game has surprisingly well platforming controls that allow players to parkour through many levels. However, the game is still lacking in the content side, with not much to actually do besides messing around. Overall, Overgrowth has the potential to be one of the most engaging platforming fighting game of 2017 (if it gets released). Current State 7/10			",66,4,0,10,3,1,0

								Reviewed in current state: 22/1/2017 Could I be seen as crazy just because I got this game due to the fact that the presentation reminded me of the 1978 film Watership Down? Maybe but aswell being won over by the unique visuals this game actually has some very good meat on it despite being early access, The meat of the game comes in two forms the content and the gameplay. The Content is ok but a little bit on the shallow side, The training is vital for this game as it shows you how the mechanical cogs of the combat works while the simple Arena and Versus in my opinion actually complement the training as bot matches help you put to practice the things you learnt from training. ( especailly learning to avoid and counter knife attacks !) After a little refinement in these game modes you're ready for the most meaningful part of the content the campaign missionsThe campaign missions really are the best as they offer gameplay structure allowing you to use both stealth and combat together rather than just the combat, So how does one describe the Campaign? well although not quite fully to the letter the Tenchu series comes to mind, Yes Just like the Tenchu series from ps1 to TenchuZ on xbox360 this game holds the same satisfaction as despite very basic level and AI design you take great joy as you slowly figure out how to assassinate and not get overrun by the AI that comes before you. Its the mix of stealth and the very addictive combat that gives the game its heart and soul! . So In the end It's THIS gameplay aswell as the content that helps make the game so far a very small but also a very healthy piece of gaming satisfaction that I would recommend to anyone who loves both the art style and the Tenchu/ Ninja-est gamplay it offers.

								Overgrowth is a third-person 3D action game that allows you to leap and climb through sprawling levels as a ninja rabbit, and engage in intricate and brutal combat with a variety of weapons and enemies. It is still very much in development, But So far, this is pretty fun game to mess around with, the combat takes skill, button mashing will KILL YOU, I had learn that the hard way, Very unique idea, Rabbits/Bunnies/Wolves/Dogs/Cats/Rats who know Martial Arts, Adapt as you battle, This game is all about Timing, and Precision, Precision beats power, Timing beats speed, And I can't forget about the WOUNDS AND THE BLOOD, so realistic for such a fantasy game, I recommend this game to anyone who wants to follow the development and watch this game grow, I don't recommend this for people who want a FULL 100% Finished game, you guys should wait, the Lugaru campaign has been remastered, AMAZING, However, I wish it was much longer, And ""great job"" Wolfire!

								I was unsure about this game when I had bought it but when I played it all i can say is it was worth the $30 spent on it. The game is a bit laggy for me but over looking a common problem this game is worth every penny its priced at. a work of art for gaming. (with parkour like assassins creed lol)			",8,3,0,0,2,0,0

								This Game is fun, although not done, it has a LOT of potential. The combat is VERY good, so good I think most fighting games should have the style of fighting that this has and, the ai (although buggy) is nowhere near stupid like most AAA games I've played. The worst thing  is THIS GAME IS STILL IN ALPHA AND I BOUGHT THIS GAME ON THE 115th UPDATE!I'VE LITTERALLY HAVE NOT HAD A STRONG ENOUGH COMPUTER TO RUN THIS GAME AFFECTIVELY FOR MORE THAN 5.4 HOURS!!!!REALLY!?!?!?!?I understand that making a game takes time but, jeez....The game is fun, and keeps you interested, but again it's still in alpha. All in all I give this game a 7.2 out of 10.I do recommend this game to people who don't mind games that aren't even close to done, but has GREAT potential. This game (as well as Starbound) got me into the Early Access games. there were two developers for this game, now there's about 23(I think), so yeah. like I mentioned, this game is nowhere near done, but, when it is? It WILL be great.I salute game devs that work hard on games like this, and listen to the community, and I know that they will go far, but FINISH THIS GAME! PLEASE!!! IT'S BEEN ON ALPHA SINCE I WAS 12! I'M 17 NOW!!! All in all, good game, Recommended.			",52,7,0,8,8,0,3

								well what can i say about overgrowth, it has the potential to be an amazing game in the future all it needs is a few tweaks. right now? i cannot reccomend it to anybody and at the price of £22.99 i just cannot ask you to buy it, it lacks content adn things to do, no multiplayer so you can game online with friends, it just a load of gobbledy goop right now so wait for a price drop and updates before you buy.(this isnt serious, oliver told me to)			",72,2,0,3,6,0,0

								At the moment I can't recommend this game. At least not for Mac. Performance on the Mac is really very very bad, despite having a very fast iMac 27inch with more than capable hardware it seems to often reach a slideshow fps for some reason. It didn't used to be like this and the game itself has it's awesomeness to some extent, but it's currently simply unplayable on Mac.Now.. it would be unfair to comment just on the Mac version and leave it at that. The current game build itself has a pretty cool melee focused combat (and parkour style movement) going for it that feels both incredibly fluid and very unique. It's graphics and style is also great, but there's still a genuine problem.The game doesn't feature any actual game content yet. Well, at least not in form of a singleplayer campaign or story mode or even more of a free roaming sandbox world. At the moment it consists of loading what I would call 'test' levels. Now I am sure it serves it's purpose for testing stuff out, but for a player there's very little value to be had here.The developer does put out regular updates and that's great, but adding new main game content seems to take a very very long time. To most people I would recommend to wait until more of either free roaming mode with stuff to do or indeed a singleplayer campaign is done. From the current game mechanics in place it is clear the developer knows how to make for decent gameplay, so don't mistake this recommendation for stating the game itself will turn out bad. But for now, I'd wait.(also.. in case anyone knows how to get rid of the slideshow fps performance on Mac, I'd gladly hear about it and update the above..)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I understand this game is in early access so it's obviously being worked on so keep that in mind when you read this review. Also keep in mind I am not some kind of game design genuis. However, unlike what some people believe, ""Early Access"" does not mean ""it's okay if it sucks!"". If you want someone to buy your game, make it enjoyable which admitidly, overgrowth is at first but the problems that riddle this game are too frustrating to ignore.This game may look pretty cool but be warned, this game is an unoptimised, unfair, overpriced and empty mess. The gimick of a semi-realistic ragdoll mechanic soon becomes frustrating as you are thrown across the map after being hit once even if you block. Also the tutorial is the most useless waste of time in a video game. I know it's still in early access but the game has been playable for YEARS and they still can't stop the game's framerate from being halved because ONE enemy ragdolled. The AI is insanely powerful and can counter all of you moves (except the broken jump kick) within a blink of an eye. When blocking sometimes you just go ragdoll when hit anyway and it's not due to being hit with different attacks continously like the tutorial says. Nope. Get hit once? Unlucky? well now you're dead. £22?!? Are you serious?? I mean no disprespect to the developers as I do hope this game gets better but REALLY?! The combat system in this game while unique is very difficult to grasp. I'm aware the combat will be refied in the future but right now. Spamming attack works better than actually trying to counter and using the jump kick is a immediate victory. Sometimes blocking just doesn't work as well. Not to mention the 12 FPS can make the combat even harder. Also the slow mo button doesn't seem to work anymore.The content in this game for the selling price is insultingly lacking.SUMMARY:SURE THE GAME WILL BE COOL WHEN IT'S DONE OKAY? BUT IT SUCKS RIGHT NOW SO WAIT TILL IT'S DONE			",118,13,0,9,8,3,3

The AI is insanely powerful and can counter all of you moves (except the broken jump kick) within a blink of an eye. When blocking sometimes you just go ragdoll when hit anyway and it's not due to being hit with different attacks continously like the tutorial says. Nope. Get hit once? Unlucky? well now you're dead. £22?!? Are you serious?? I mean no disprespect to the developers as I do hope this game gets better but REALLY?! The combat system in this game while unique is very difficult to grasp. I'm aware the combat will be refied in the future but right now. Spamming attack works better than actually trying to counter and using the jump kick is a immediate victory. Sometimes blocking just doesn't work as well. Not to mention the 12 FPS can make the combat even harder. Also the slow mo button doesn't seem to work anymore.The content in this game for the selling price is insultingly lacking.SUMMARY:SURE THE GAME WILL BE COOL WHEN IT'S DONE OKAY? BUT IT SUCKS RIGHT NOW SO WAIT TILL IT'S DONE			",118,13,0,9,8,3,3

								At the moment I can't recommend this game. At least not for Mac. Performance on the Mac is really very very bad, despite having a very fast iMac 27inch with more than capable hardware it seems to often reach a slideshow fps for some reason. It didn't used to be like this and the game itself has it's awesomeness to some extent, but it's currently simply unplayable on Mac.Now.. it would be unfair to comment just on the Mac version and leave it at that. The current game build itself has a pretty cool melee focused combat (and parkour style movement) going for it that feels both incredibly fluid and very unique. It's graphics and style is also great, but there's still a genuine problem.The game doesn't feature any actual game content yet. Well, at least not in form of a singleplayer campaign or story mode or even more of a free roaming sandbox world. At the moment it consists of loading what I would call 'test' levels. Now I am sure it serves it's purpose for testing stuff out, but for a player there's very little value to be had here.The developer does put out regular updates and that's great, but adding new main game content seems to take a very very long time. To most people I would recommend to wait until more of either free roaming mode with stuff to do or indeed a singleplayer campaign is done. From the current game mechanics in place it is clear the developer knows how to make for decent gameplay, so don't mistake this recommendation for stating the game itself will turn out bad. But for now, I'd wait.(also.. in case anyone knows how to get rid of the slideshow fps performance on Mac, I'd gladly hear about it and update the above..)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Despite it being in alpha for about 8 years, Overgrowth offers combat gameplay like non other. The fighting mechanic in this game is brutal and fast, and has this heavy sense of weight. The game features full body physics with ragdolls and collisions, and also features a myriad of weapons. Since the game is still far from complete, the devs allow you to mess around with many tools and different maps, as well as the newly updated Lugaru campaign as well as a challenge mode. Also, the game has surprisingly well platforming controls that allow players to parkour through many levels. However, the game is still lacking in the content side, with not much to actually do besides messing around. Overall, Overgrowth has the potential to be one of the most engaging platforming fighting game of 2017 (if it gets released). Current State 7/10			",66,4,0,10,3,1,0

								I got this game after Lugaru's campaign was part of it. Overgrowth has been in development for a very long time, so don't expect masses of updates. The campaign is very challenging, but once you get the combat down, it can become incredibly satisfying. There are other gamemodes too, such as arena, where you fight off against other innocent rabbits.I would recommend this game, but only if you can get it cheap, because in its current state, it is not worth full price.

								I understand this game is in early access so it's obviously being worked on so keep that in mind when you read this review. Also keep in mind I am not some kind of game design genuis. However, unlike what some people believe, ""Early Access"" does not mean ""it's okay if it sucks!"". If you want someone to buy your game, make it enjoyable which admitidly, overgrowth is at first but the problems that riddle this game are too frustrating to ignore.This game may look pretty cool but be warned, this game is an unoptimised, unfair, overpriced and empty mess. The gimick of a semi-realistic ragdoll mechanic soon becomes frustrating as you are thrown across the map after being hit once even if you block. Also the tutorial is the most useless waste of time in a video game. I know it's still in early access but the game has been playable for YEARS and they still can't stop the game's framerate from being halved because ONE enemy ragdolled. The AI is insanely powerful and can counter all of you moves (except the broken jump kick) within a blink of an eye.

								I'm reviewing this without recommending it. Hopefully by the end of this it'll be somewhat clear why.This game is really cool. It's a third person outdoor map game with awesome running, jumping, climbing and fighting mechanics. The dude who made the game made the engine himself from scratch and it is slick as HELL. It runs wicked smooth on hardware it doesn't have any right to run so smoothly on and looks great. The animations for everything from crouching to running to fighting to jumping and rolling are also slick as hell. The guy making the engine is incredibly talented and has done some really neat stuff with animations that make the game very immersive. The combat is pretty realistic and enjoyable too. You can get into some very fast, very intense kicking/grappling/swordfighting fights that are very brutal and satisfying.Now, having said all that, I'm not sure this game is EVER going to be finished. I backed it on kickstarter a few years ago just because I happened to have a bit of cash and thought ""hey, this looks like it deserves support"". While the game has certainly had a fair amount of updates, a lot of them have been pretty minor tweaks to thinks like textures and animations, in other words: all tech. I'm worried this game is going to get stuck in a permanent ""tinker"" phase and nothing concrete that can be called an actual game will ever come out of the process, or at best it'll take way too long. The latest update for example had something like procedural idle animations, so that the animation of the character standing there would have some somewhat randomized aspects to it...turning the head, breathing, etc. That is very neat...and very cool, but uhhhh....are they going to do stuff like this for 2 more years? I am not very assured that there is anyone on this tiny team who is actually working hard at creating good game CONTENT. Right now it's basically a jumping and fighting sandbox, and normally I wouldn't care, but as I've said, it's been that for YEARS now.			",588,119,12,59,39,4,56

								This is game is ok in the fighting combat engine that Wolfire did, and I applaud that. But thats about the only thing i applaud in this game. Its buggy, its been an alpha for years. The bundle with Recievers ok, but Reciever doesnt even have a story and its just an excuse to buy this game so you think your getting a deal. When you Alt+Tab out of the game, it totally bugs out. For some reason, the level editor and the level are one thing. Thats not very good. Also if you spawn in an enemy, they'll only fight when you are in the level editor mode, they won't fight when they are in the game. The arena mode can be buggy aswell. Its a cool aspect and all, but if you use the lightning bolt thing ability to kill everyone nothing can be decided because the game can't figure out that everyone died due to you. Also, I grabbed this on steam a few months back, and there hasnt been an update since before I even owned the game. The game was appeasing before as a cool little alpha that should be more reasonably priced or just kinda free. This game is a bad deal for an alpha, nothing that this game is nowhere near complete. The developers need to learn better management and to maybe just release a quick update that may fix some issues with the game and make the level editor mode in a different function of the game. This game has alot of potential, but the game developers aren't caring enough to take it. If you asked me, I would just buy some other game that has a physics based engine like this, which are not scarce on the internet if you just search a bit. Good luck to the developers and I hope you figure out something new for this game.			",147,15,2,4,20,0,5

								Many of the popular comments are negative on Overgrowth's slow development, but keep in mind they hired more devs recently and updates went from several month gaps to 1-2 weeks each. That's good for Overgrowth, which from the start was built from scratch, on their own engine, that simulates realistic physics, forces, impacts and flowing blood, all in real-time. It runs smoother than butter for me.What it is currently is really a sandbox. There's a big selection of pre-made levels, mostly Arenas and landscapes, and you can spawn in many items (trees, buildings, NPCs, weaponry). There's a lot of potential to make your own stuff too, since you can resize and transform assets as you please, as well as plot paths for NPCs to move on. Personally I'm not too interested in all of that but it leaves huge room for mods, which you can download from the SUMLauncher on the Wolfire site.But enough of brushing over the technical details, the gameplay is key. Combat is phenomenal in every way. You can throw your adversaries over your head, kick them to death, roundhouse kick their faces, disarm them, whatever you please - all of it can be done by the left and right mouse button. Incredibly easy to learn, incredibly hard to master. The game's got fluid animations and motion too, and it's very easy to do parkour and blend that into fighting. Wallrun, jump off and slam dunk a bunny. This game's got it all.I personally love this game, though I understand it's not for everyone. Something something furry heaven, blah blah development hell etc. For what's in the game now I think it's well worth your money.			",333,44,9,28,20,2,21

								The game is fun, beautiful and has one of the best fighting mechanics I have ever seen in fighting games like this. But with all the crashing bugs, optimization issues and lag despite me having this $1000 computer would be acceptable if it weren't for the fact that the game has been in Alpha for over 3 years. Nobody knows when this game is going to have its release, and so far it doesn't seem like it is anytime soon. Unless you like seeing the game grow and age to be a perfect game upon launch like I have been doing for the past 3 years, I would just wait until the game comes out.			",73,1,0,4,4,0,0

Early Access Review
								I'm not really sure what to think about this one. While I do enjoy the combat, and the level editor is as deep and accessible as that of Farcry 2, there really isn't enough content to justify the price tag. Depth is fine, but even the ""levels"" made for expressly showcasing said depth are plagued by errors that contradict their intended purpose. There are faulty checkpoints, glitched movement in some areas, crashes, and AI that doesn't know what to do with itself. Modders have done a much better job creating good-looking levels that fully use the power of the game.Visually, the game is great, except when I start hitting hiccups associated wih either bad hardware optimization and missing files. (I found the ""checker skybox"" to be particularly amusing.) Once these glitches start, they don't stop.I could forgive all of this, except for one fact. Before playing it again for this review, I last sat down with it at least half a year ago. I was impressed, but I remember thinking, ""I bet this is going to have more content later."" Present day, I played again, and was confused at how little had been added.Such a wait is minimal, from what I've heard. Apparently, this game has been in development limbo for almost seven years. During the time this game has been in its alpha stages, I've seen members of my family be born and later attend first grade, and this game still isn't finished. I understand that not many people are working on it, but charging $30 for a product that has taken this long, that is this devoid of longevity, and that still has not been completed... ah...It's like paying for a car that's over half a decade old, and missing pieces, under the promise that one day, I will be able to drive it around and have fun.Until then, this game is little more than a glorified level editor for ninja animals.

								As you can see, I generally recommend this game, but it's not that simple. Thi is still an alpha title and you should take this into account should you consider to spend money here. I have posted the following text on the forum a few times and I think it is still accurate. But before I start, let me give you the tl;dr version: do some research first to find out if you can justify spending money on this title right now. Watch gameplay videos and tutorials. Try to get an idea of what there is right now and what you can expect in the future. Then make a decision.Gameplay:The game has two major gameplay selling points. The movement and the combat.Movement: The game lets you move around very quickly. You can jump up very high and you can run along walls and jump off of them and grab ledges to reach higher platforms. All these features are very easy to control and feel very fluent. The game lets you move around at high speeds and jumping around like that is very satisfying for some people.If you just want to have some stupid fun you can use the debug keys to slit your character's throat and enjoy the way blood is handled in the game or making enter one of the ragdoll modes and watch him tumble down a cliff.[/u]Combat:[/u] The combat is absolutely outstanding. Every move is triggered by your own movement and the character will perform the most appropriate move for his position in relation to the opponent. This may sound as if it was automatic, but the way the fights are handled in the game actually gives you complete control over what you are doing. After some training you will be able to position yourself just right to do exactly what you want to do.For me, the hand to hand combat is just about perfect. It's probably the best combat I have ever seen in an action game. Every move has its purpose and you can really use tactics to fight certain opponents. The weapons still need some more balancing in my opinion, but they are fun as well.Is it fun?: You have to keep in mind that there may be a bunch of maps and even an arena that puts in one fight after the other and makes the opponents tougher or weaker depending on your performance, but none of that is tied together by any sort of story yet. If you get your fun in games from progressing through a story and moving from one map to the next one, you should probably wait until the campaign is there. If you enjoy combat and like to play around in a sandbox style game, you can already get it and will have fun with it.Map Editor and making your own stuff:The game has a map editor. It is still pretty bare bones, but you can create simple maps fairly easily by editing an existing map, putting models into it, modifying them and then saving it. If you invest some more time you can create more elaborate maps, for example by putting cutscenes in that trigger when the character reaches a certain point. There are many tutorials available for more complicated things (e.g. creating your own terrain so that you don't have to edit an existing map, or for creating caves), but creating your first map is pretty easy.Some more experienced users have created custom characters and models to give the community more stuff to play with. Maybe you have some experience with modelling and would like to do that too.Is it fun?: If you like creating stuff the game has plenty to offer, even if you are not a very technical person. The map editor is easy to use and you can create your first map in a very short time. If you have some experience, you can create your own models, characters and complete maps. There are tutorials on the Wolfire Forums that can get you started.Community content:The community has created tons of stuff that you can add to your game. There is even a tool, the SUMLauncher, that will help you to install maps, objects and characters with just a few clicks. It cannot handle script mods, but that feature will probably be added at some point.Maps: There are very many maps, ranging from very simple attempts, to parkour maps and massive structures for you to explore, all the way elaborate maps that tell little stories. Some maps are also used to present custom assets.Custom content: This content comes in the forms of new characters (a few examples: we have a few human characters, a bird creature and a zombified version of the main character), new weapons, objects for building structures (e.g. assets to create a modern city with streets and skyscrapers, or a Viking scene), objects tied to scripts (e.g. a landmine, a homing missile, rain, snow, water), new moves and probably some stuff I am forgetting. It's a lot.Mods: There are also a few mods out there. Some change little things about the game, some add features and some change the gameplay. My Favourites are Last's Blood Mod and Korban's First Person Mod. The first person mod is pretty self explanatory. The Blood Mod started as a mod that gave a you a few options to make the game more or less bloody, but has since become a collection of a few mods. A few of the features that can be activated individually: there's a flying mod. It lets you flap your arms to gain height and glide. The controls a very fluent and you can get some serious speed while gliding. There is a feature that makes your character enter ragdoll mode if you run into a wall or another character at high speed. This can effectively be used as tackle. It adds a few debug keys, for example to make you invincible. There are also some experimental features.These mods have to be installed manually and are often not compatible with one another, since they edit the same files, but installing them is usually just done via drag and drop.Is it fun?: The community has created so much stuff for users to play with. If you preorder it you should definitely check it out, especially if you want to make maps yourself or get into modding the game.Closing points:I hope this helps you to come to a decision. Please take your time. This game probably is not for everyone and 30$ may not be very expensive for a game, but since it is still an alpha some features simply are not there yet and you will have to put some trust into the developers. If you cannot do that right now, you should probably wait.Please also keep in mind that there are many videos online that can show you the game in action. I especially recommend the videos over at Overgrowth Weekly.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrdInI6WObozTTRW_59p6wgHe has some of the best tutorials especially for parkour and combat. But he also tells you how to get the game in the first place and how to use the editor. He also hosts regular Q&A sessions with the team, where they tackle questions by the community.Parkour tutorial:

The uploads by Wolfire themselves also feature a lot of gameplay and editor footage and always tell you the latest additions to the game.https://www.youtube.com/user/WolfireGamesOne last thing. If you eventually decide to preorder the game, compare the prices on Steam and the Humble Store. Both will give you the same thing (i.e. Overgrowth, plus Receiver and Low Light Combat), but depending on your region, Steam might be more expensive. Both websites also have it on sale from time to time.Getting access to the Secret Preorder Forum on Wolfire is also a lot easier if you preorder from the Humble Store. I have read many complaints from people who had trouble getting access after preordering from Steam. If you preorder from the Humble Store you will be able to get your Wolfire account the way people have done it ever since the game was announced and you can get it on Steam with two or three clicks from your Humble Store page.

Overgrowth, The beautiful failure.I've been with this game since 2011 and I can honestly say this is a complete failure of a game. I bought it on steam about 2 years ago still having some faith in their idea but they've shown me that was a complete waste of money. Regardless of how slow the developers are making the game, If this were to be finished in 2020 it would still be a failure by then for it would be an outdated game. All updates I see pop up every few (2-5) months hardly have any content at all, it's all mediocre maps, random textures and a few ai combat tweaks here and there which is clearly not what they should be prioritized on.bad game 5/7the end.

								Currently, Overgrowth is more of a tech demo than a game, although the tech being demoed is pretty great. You can run around the levels, and there is an arena mode. It also has a level editor, which is probably one of the main reasons to get this now, if that's something you want to mess with.If you haven't, check out Wolfire's development blog. Over the years, they've put up a lot of videos on their work. You should probably check them out before buying this, and they're pretty interesting, anyway. On the other hand, if you aren't interested in the game's development process or using the editing tools, you should probably wait until there is more content.			",218,83,1,28,23,2,18

								As previous reviewrs have mentioned, development is slow, but considering it's a one (or two/three) man team working with an engine they created - a good looking and ambitous one for such a small team - of course it takes time to make changes to such an engine. If you've ever played Lugaru and wish to support their Dev(s) in their goal to create a sequel and help them along the way with feedback (Wich is what Early Access is for, not buying, complaining about an unfinished game and getting a refund as you downvote it; Which ironically makes it harder to develop as funding is pulled) then go ahead and spend the money if you can spare it.Also, you can play Local Co-Op and kill your friends. Just don't downvote becuase you don't know where the controller goes into your computer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Furries and Awesome fighting, what is there not to like. In detail the game features very tight hand to hand combat and weapon combat couple with the best friggin ragdoll physics imaginable. Everything is physicly simulated from the damage you take in combat (bones, blood etc.) to how armor is attached (linked to bone structure). It's a beautiful game and plays out amazingly. The editor allows total creative freedom in making maps, events, and other nicknacks.For an alpha game thats been around a while now it is pretty well polished. It recieves updates regularly and just gets better. Only downside is don't expect it to move in development too fast. It is produced by a very small group (4 according to the wiki).Highly recommended game. Just remember the alpha is a by product that you get access to for preordering, ultimately what your paying for is a preorder to a game that will come out in the future.			",156,17,2,19,27,0,43

								As previous reviewrs have mentioned, development is slow, but considering it's a one (or two/three) man team working with an engine they created - a good looking and ambitous one for such a small team - of course it takes time to make changes to such an engine. If you've ever played Lugaru and wish to support their Dev(s) in their goal to create a sequel and help them along the way with feedback (Wich is what Early Access is for, not buying, complaining about an unfinished game and getting a refund as you downvote it; Which ironically makes it harder to develop as funding is pulled) then go ahead and spend the money if you can spare it.Also, you can play Local Co-Op and kill your friends. Just don't downvote becuase you don't know where the controller goes into your computer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Currently, Overgrowth is more of a tech demo than a game, although the tech being demoed is pretty great. You can run around the levels, and there is an arena mode. It also has a level editor, which is probably one of the main reasons to get this now, if that's something you want to mess with.If you haven't, check out Wolfire's development blog. Over the years, they've put up a lot of videos on their work. You should probably check them out before buying this, and they're pretty interesting, anyway. On the other hand, if you aren't interested in the game's development process or using the editing tools, you should probably wait until there is more content.			",218,83,1,28,23,2,18

								8 years in development, what do we have to show:- excellent combat system- revolutionary, novel systems including reflective light particles- diverse modding system - brilliant physics - character options- recycled campaign from lugaru - awful performance (1/8res at 720p runs at 30fps)- many crashes, even for a beta - probably more now than in the alpha- a glitch where if you try and turn your volume down it'll set your PC volume to 100% and blow your speakers/wake everyone in your neightbourhood up- stupidly long loading times even on SSDI really want to like Overgrowth, hell I do like it but there's no way this can be recommeded. Played again for the first time in about a year and not much has changed apart from inferior performance, some more editing options which aren't usable because the performance is so bad, and the lugaru campaign...

								Although the game is still VERY early in alpha, this game is shockingly entertaining and fun! Overgrowth creates a large focus on its custom combat system, which is quite sophisticated. Unlike most fighting games, Overgrowth uses a skeletal structure within the model of each character to determine damage depending on location of a hit, rather than the traditional health system. This means that enemies can be taken out in as little as one percise hit. Overgrowth Alpha features sharp weapons, such as the dagger, a quick blade that can be used on an enemy after a sneak attack from behind, the spear, which is a good weapon for distancing melee attacks, and the sword, a brutal one-hit-kill. Each blade can be thrown. Aside from combat, Overgrowth already features an in-game map editor. Overgrowth's map editor is inside each map chosen from the main menu, so there is no need for extra software. Many of the physical aspects are customizable. Each character can be resized and rebuilt to fit a character of your liking, added with the ability to attach any object to the skeleton. One of the most exciting features about Overgrowth is the ability to parkour your way around each map. Objects can be scaled up and over with ease. Pair that with an amazing combat system, and that sounds like a great game to me!Overgrowth is also available for pre-order at www.Wolfire.com. Pre-order at the developers' site to receive Overgrowth Alpha, along with Receiver and Low Light Combat for free.			",179,11,1,9,6,0,8

								Let me start by saying, I recommend this gamehowever it has been in its alpha start for along time and it seems as though the devs have abandoned it.it has one of if not the best melee combat systems of all time. but there is very little game here, few levels and little point but i find the combat good enough to enjoy what is there in moderation, in its current state it is worth nowhere near the $30 pricetag, and it seems as though it will never leave this state.but i still recomend it if good mechanics can make a game for you, it just has little content, but it does have a decent level editor and has great potential to be an amazing game			",57,4,0,3,16,0,6

								I like this game. I do. Its fun, and a refreshing take on fighting. Even though its animals fighting each other, its a very realistic fighting game. And parkour game. But once you go through all the ""scenario's"", it gets really boring. Nothing to do but spawn in a ton of enemies to fight you. Sure this is also fun for a while, but soon becomes a hassle to reset the level, spawn the characters in, spawn weapons in, and then do it over again. This most of the time will crash the game at least once after you open it. I want to like this game, and a lot of replayability, but with so little content the replayability factor wears down. Not to mention a lot of levels are almost unplayable because of missing textures. Again, I want to love this game, but its not worth 30$ and has been in development for a LONG time, with no changes whatsoever in the last year. In short, a game that is so close to being awesome, but because of development levels and lack of anything but sandbox and arena, it's a sharp knife of fresh combat that breaks off a piece every time you play, slowly dulling into boring repetitiveness.

								Do not buy yet! Bought about a year ago, was still early access. Video reviews on youtube looked great and said would be multiplayer relatively soon. Still no multiplayer with very small changes. This game is not worth 20+ without multiplayer. There is not a campaign or anything you can do unless you create your own. You are literally buying a few scenarios with a survival arena mode. Gameplay is fun, but no way near worth the price. Updates are few and far between. I have more hours than my steam account shows because I was playing with an updated build. Save your money til full release.Update June 2016 : Still no multiplayer this game has been in alpha for several years...			",152,15,2,24,11,4,17

Just buy it if you are experienced with Issues and a lot of ""googling"" how to solve those Issues.Also, just if you have enough Time to look some Youtube Videos of ""How does this Editor even Work?""The Game does NOT have Online Multiplayer and DOES NOT have a Story. So all you can do is to pwn some random Computer Enemies. So just buy it if you have Friends to play with (Local!!).Also you need Controllers, cuz two on One Keyboard is literly impossible. So if you want to play with 4 Friends: 3 Controllers and 1 Keyboard.The Most of my Playtime goes for solving Issues and mapping in the Editor. It was still pretty fun and I really like this Game, but its just to user-unfriendly to recommend it to EVERYONE.So Prepare for 1 - 2 Hours to getting all Started, and then let the Local Mutliplayer Fun begin!Important: This Game is in Early Access for 6 Years now, and there wasnt any mentionable Patch coming out.Wich means: What you see NOW is what you get, and what you get is not worth the Fullprice.Wait for a good Sale, then get it.Grapics: 7 / 10Story: There is no Story. All you can do is to pown some AI. So just buy it if you have Friends to play with (But Local!)Combat: 9 / 10			",90,6,1,12,5,2,5

								There is a lot to say about this game, mostly postive, but I will try and cut it down to basics. I cant really do an average rate of each element yet because this game is so under-developed. It is very much alpha, and will probably be some time before we see a full-release. That alone can be a negative for most. Im going to tell you why its not.1. The developers are doing something amazing here. This is already one of the most complex combat games I have every seen. Its one of the few games out there that repects physically to the full extent durring combat. 2. It has a continuely growing gameplay and updates are added frequently. They are not only building a storyline game, but a mod friendly, developer game. Right now, you can change everything. They give you as much ability as them, and that is currently what the game is. 3. The vast ability oft his game is more than a few blank maps, 1 model enemy, a few weapons, and thats it. There is some of the most creative maps I have seen in a combat game in awhile. The time era here is difficult to pin, (Because all characters are animal :P) but they only have swords, axes, spears, hammers, etc. that makes the games combat a little more interesting, and forces it to be more detailed. 4. Despite the fact that you play as 7 foot tall rabbits, dogs, cats, rats, etc, this game is very realalistic. You can literally kill yourself by jumping of a high structure and snapping your neck. The sword fighting is also very detailed.

								There is a lot to say about this game, mostly postive, but I will try and cut it down to basics. I cant really do an average rate of each element yet because this game is so under-developed. It is very much alpha, and will probably be some time before we see a full-release. That alone can be a negative for most. Im going to tell you why its not.1. The developers are doing something amazing here. This is already one of the most complex combat games I have every seen. Its one of the few games out there that repects physically to the full extent durring combat. 2. It has a continuely growing gameplay and updates are added frequently. They are not only building a storyline game, but a mod friendly, developer game. Right now, you can change everything. They give you as much ability as them, and that is currently what the game is. 3. The vast ability oft his game is more than a few blank maps, 1 model enemy, a few weapons, and thats it. There is some of the most creative maps I have seen in a combat game in awhile. The time era here is difficult to pin, (Because all characters are animal :P) but they only have swords, axes, spears, hammers, etc. that makes the games combat a little more interesting, and forces it to be more detailed. 4. Despite the fact that you play as 7 foot tall rabbits, dogs, cats, rats, etc, this game is very realalistic. You can literally kill yourself by jumping of a high structure and snapping your neck. The sword fighting is also very detailed. Ending a 3 minute battle with no hits with a slow motion throat slit of your enemy is satisfying to say the least.If you dont like waiting for a game to have its release, and hate waiting on developers, maybe this game isnt for you. But its a shame is you dont, because you have no idea what your missing out on. When this game has its full release and has an amazing story, the best combat ever, beautiful graphics, and is rated extremely highly. Go ahead an buy it then.

								Game is still pretty broken. Funny concept I guess. Do not recommend though.

								Because making your game so increasingly difficult that you can't even ♥♥♥♥ing play it is always a good idea.There's challenge - and there's having mechanics so broken you can't even do anything.AI just spam generic attacks until you fall over.All those ""combat physics"" are real neat until you realise everything you're up against will do the equivilent of button-mashing with pitch-perfect accuracy (as they are AI), and how tactics becomes completely meaningless.What's the point in having Armor, or advanced strategy when the AI will simply do 1 attack over and over and instantly kill you?I feel like the game has hardly anything to do with the mechanics they introduce into combat and much rather have it centered around ""we'll get to that later"".""What's that?""""We have so much potential in the constant combat updates we bring into the picture but don't actually do anything with these new and innovative ideas?""""Meeeh. I'll get to it later.""This has been in development for most of my actual life, and it's still trash since I bought it.In fact, the development is only making the game worse.I don't know how you did it - but you took alpha mechanics that were at best interesting and turned them into garbage.With every update that is released, 1 thing is fixed and 2 things are broken.The funniest part is that the community has gone from ""Hopefully waiting for Next Update"" to ""Last post: 2014"" in a blink of an eye.I recommend anyone that is legitimately interested in this project not to hold their breath.Give it another 9 years, if they don't sack the project by then.

								Overgrowth er et sindsygt godt spil. Jeg har aldrig nogensinde spillet med bedre 3rd person engine og det er særriøst detaljeret med den måde som man kan slås med andre deltagere. Mekanikken i spillet giver spilleren lov til selv at have en kampstil. Er også stor fan af den måde pillet ser ud på. Istedet for elvere eller orker har man kaniner og ulve der render rundt med kamoflage dragter, svær og spyd, hvilket i mine øjne for alting til at se meget mere dystert og rådt ud end rigtig mange andre spil. Overgrowth kan helt sikkert anbefales hvis man godt kunne tænke sig noget mere udfordrende og fremmed.			",55,12,1,0,8,0,1

								Do you like fast paced and brutal fighting machanics? Yes? then you like Overgrowth, I've got almost 2o hours into it so far and I've loved it. Reminds me of darks souls in the since that it's not about your level but your own skills, you can play bothing games flawlessly without taking damage. While updates are somewhat rare, what is here is great, the story mode that they have so far is, good it's only about and hour. The arena mode will keep you busy and the editors is meh. Long load times and minimal content but the machanics are where it's at. But at this point I'm rambling so i'll stop. It's good but not much, at this state it's 7.5/10 but when plenty more content hits it'll go up to 8 or vary likely 9/10.			",53,11,0,3,6,0,1

								I highly recommend this game. Its fast, skillful, satisfying, challenging, gorgeous, well animated, smooth, gruesome, runs very nicely on even some lower-middle end computers, highly customizable in that the editor is outstanding and intuitive which allows for a large community to express itself, and it is extremely detailed and accurate in both it's combat and animation. It would be very cool to see this have a vast open world compaign with a script written with help from the community. As of now it is only closed levels but they are quite large, customizable and beautiful. With all this being said, there is still one major issue I have with this game: So you've got a game, a very well sculpted game, that has a vast amount of code and attention to detail, but its almost as if you've built a mansion on wobbily stilts. Its like a one legged chair, the leg is rounded on the bottom yet you have a masterpiece of a throne on top. The game crashes a lot. It needs a stronger foundation in order to keep itself upright, if you want to think of it that way. Thankfully the crashes usually come during intense combat and not level editing from what I've seen, it could be different for othersSo would I recommend this game? Whole-heartedly, yes. There are plenty of fixes for the crashes and you can send the crash files to the developer. The game has been in development for a long time and has only gotten more and more popular. As a side note to the developer, I and probably a large portion of the community, wouldn't mind a period of time (however long it takes) where the only updates were crash fixes and foundation builds. The game is very much so a sandbox and doesn't need menu updates or any of that for a bit in my opinion. I would just like to see a stronger base. Thank you. And to whoever is reading this, I would pick this game up ASAP or at least keep it in the top 3 of your wishlist. Its a great game and I don't think I will ever get sick of it (that means a lot coming from the person who can't stay on other games for more than 5 minutes).			",99,5,1,5,13,0,3

Some of the weapons are op and need some nerfing The game itself is still buggy and crashes from time to time,But its still in alpha so it will pass. The parkour is decent and even But still needs other things added into it like when running you could just hoop over an object instead of just jumping over it. Npcs are mysterous you never know what it will throw at you. The game is not finished yet and things like *multiplayer haven't been added and there is no workshop other then the sum launcher. but again a game like this needs to take time to build.

								This game has been in alpha for what was it . . . like 7 years or so? Now, most average Joe's would find that a bad sign and just give up, but i find it a good sign. This may not look like an Indie game but it is (yeah, big wow to the average Joe's who don't check the tags) and a game like this takes time . . . especially as an indie game. There is no multiplayer yet and i have multiple missing textures for the sky . . . which should be fixed, lots of bad sign's but when this game is finished it will have multiplayer, and hopefully no missing textures. the combat is great and the parkour is fun, making your own levels is extra fun. Just give the game a chance, and if you don't like it well now Steam has a refund system so there you go . . . just try it.EDIT: I forgot to mention that the game does crash once in a while but what can you expect from an alpha? I doubt that will be the case in the finished product. Also forgot to mention that this game does have local multiplayer and controller support.			",39,6,1,1,6,2,0

								Although in early development, Overgrowth stands out to most as an incredible non-AAA title. The floaty yet dynamic physics compliment the mysterious style of the game, while further updates reveal it's true nature. Fighting your rabbit kin or the ""big bad wolf"" has never been more enjoyable, and a game like this deserves recognition from the gaming community.

								I know I haven't played much of this game, but hear me out on why I'm not recommending OvergrowthI bought and installed this game last year for my Windows XP (I know, risky move) and I managed to launch it. After 10 - 20 minutes of loading I saw two laggy anthropomorphic bunnies in a Mortal Kombat kind of stance. Pressing D, the left being started to move, leaving a trail of itself all over the window. I figured I was an idiot for buying it for a severely outdated PC.Then, recently, I re-installed it for my Windows 8.1That's when I realized I was a chump in the first place for buying it. Same problem, this time on the screen of a more updated OS. This games seems like a great experience, as seen from the footage online I've viewed. Unfortunately, I'm not able to have fun with the $30 I threw away.			",86,18,0,12,13,0,7

								This game has been in alpha for what was it . . . like 7 years or so? Now, most average Joe's would find that a bad sign and just give up, but i find it a good sign. This may not look like an Indie game but it is (yeah, big wow to the average Joe's who don't check the tags) and a game like this takes time . . . especially as an indie game. There is no multiplayer yet and i have multiple missing textures for the sky . . . which should be fixed, lots of bad sign's but when this game is finished it will have multiplayer, and hopefully no missing textures. the combat is great and the parkour is fun, making your own levels is extra fun. Just give the game a chance, and if you don't like it well now Steam has a refund system so there you go . . . just try it.EDIT: I forgot to mention that the game does crash once in a while but what can you expect from an alpha? I doubt that will be the case in the finished product. Also forgot to mention that this game does have local multiplayer and controller support.			",39,6,1,1,6,2,0

								Overgrowth is a unique 3rd person fighting game. You can parkour off walls and ledges; seeing as you play as a rabbit, you can jump really high and far. Even though it's in alpha, it plays beautifully. So far, there is no mulitplayer. But Wolfire has already promised the creation of multiplayer and a full campaign. It's fun to play around with the ragdoll and the slowmotion effects. I have really high expectations for this game, and even though its cost is higher then you might want to pay, I bought it on a whim, and ended up getting lucky. If it's fun as it is now, I can't wait to see what Wolfire has in store for us. And now it comes with Receiver, which i suggest you also look into.			",211,36,1,14,16,1,13

								Overgrowth is a well spoken about game on youtube, but still dosen't get the publicity it needs to have. Created by Wolfire Games overgrowth is more of a spiritual successor to the game Lugaru that a sequel at the moment. There is no true point to the game yet, it is a free roam thing with an IN DEPTH level editor with plenty of ways to make machinima and custom armoer for your character. In the game you play as a delightfully awesome cast of human? like? animals that include so far as bunny(with different types of bunnies),cat,wolf,dog, and a robot bunny? Each character has there own perks from running faster, jumping higher, or when it comes to the wolf ANIALATING ALL ENEMIES VERY QUICKLY. As well as amazing intuitive smooth parkour which i am in love with, it has what i would only describe as the best combat in all of video games. A system were rather than puncg with individual clicks, you enter a battle mode by holding the mouse button allowing you to focus entirely on what forms of attack you will perform usiing the directionals,crouch(shift),and jumping(space to perform the coolest manuver in all of video games!). The blocking system is fast you must block at the right time when the blow would have hit you which isnt easy even when the games in slow motion, oh yeah by the way tab makes the game slow mo and double tapping it freezes the game... HOW ARE U NOT BUYING THIS. As of now there is no story but the level editor and arena mode(truly test your combat skills) is enough to keep me entranced hours on end. Best part about it with steams auto update system you can be sure you are getting the most of the experience. The company that makes it, Wolfire, seem like cool guys(or guy?) on there website and forum you can see the latest news on updates and how to play the game not to mention there youtube channel Wolfire Games. I can see they have alot of hope in this game and truly want it to go places i mean its been in work for a while.

								This is a developing sandbox game, where you are a rabbit (there are other character models) and you parkour around. You can fight other NPCs in the arena, jump across sky pillars, wallrun, backflip, and probably a whole ton more of awesome stuff that I haven't found yet. Very fun and very addicting. There are bugs, but it is deleloping. (You also get Receiver for free if you buy this!)			",152,16,4,8,7,0,3

								This game is nothing short of amazing. ive been following the game for quite some time since it was announced. When it come to steam i just had to buy this. its probably one of the best games ive played this year. The game does crash alot so be ready for it but what can you expect for a game thats in alpha. i look forward to the future updates to see what else could be added to the mad world of overgrowth.

								Updates very slowly. Fun brawler. Credit to the Dev for communicating the updates so well. Lots of love and detail put into it. Do not buy unless you want to support it. Buy Lugaru. Mostly reviewing because I belive the game deserves a positive review. All the negativity kinda sucks. Yes the game updates very slowly, but it's been consistenly updated. And yeah, there used to be a lot less content. Also a lot of the little details you just kinda miss unless you know about them. Such as the blood, various injury poses, critical damage spots, the ragdoll animations. It's fun, but ultimately empty right now. Honestly if it takes after Lugaru, the gameplay that there is now, is all there will be. Some platforming, and some satisfying combat. 6/10 for just right now, 7/10 if you like the type of game, 8/10 if you can appreciate the little details. Overall, above average to good. For me, I like it, it's quite good. But as I say with early access games, buy it ONLY if you're okay with the content in the game right now, and if you're okay with the Dev being a dumbass and potentially releasing a string of bad updates and ignoring the community (seems unlikely here, but still, beware).

								I recommend this game because it is stupid fun even in an alpha stage. I have clocked countless hours and I say that as I have been accessing this game via the SUM launcher and it doesn't count hours. I highly recommend the SUM launcher as well, but it requires you purchase the game in early access. I digress, the parkour/free running is as it should be, not too easy and not too hard, but it has challenge. Unlike the Assassins creed games where it is run at a wall and hope for the best. What makes it better is when you pull of an awesome stunt, look back and feel awesome. Combat is superb, It feels real. You can dodge and counter in many different ways. Like ducking under a kick and sweeping, Sparta kick them when they go to sweep you, roll and hit them from behind or simply parry and judo throw them over your shoulder. The weapons aren't ""hit, block,hit, block, take the hit, hit, take 20x hits, hit once dead"" oh no, it is incredibly balanced between PvP and PvE. It is like ""hit, block, dodge, hit, get hit, dead"". Also, this game comes bundled with the first person horror game 'reciever' made by wolfire games (which cannot be purchased on steam and is pretty good). I wish it came with Lugaru (the previous game) but beggars can't be choosers. Anyway, I highly recommend this game.			",75,12,0,7,5,0,3

I hope that this wonderful game meets the potential it has set for itself.

								Have owned this game for quite a while now and come back to it every now and again.. But I'm not sure why.It never seems to change, theres never anything new in it. The game has amazing combat and physics, but thats it. Theres no story what so ever, no real guidance, and to be fair, extremely over priced for the small amount of content.The modding scene is there and active. But, you need an access code to get there, would be much easier to do this through Steam. And its sad that we must rely on the modding scene to give us more content. The devs don't seem to be doing anything.I'm sorry, I really do like this game and would love to recommend it, but I can't.Graphics 7/10Physics 10/10Replayability 2/10Story N/AWait for it to be less than $10 or until they add something.

								Updates very slowly. Fun brawler. Credit to the Dev for communicating the updates so well. Lots of love and detail put into it. Do not buy unless you want to support it. Buy Lugaru. Mostly reviewing because I belive the game deserves a positive review. All the negativity kinda sucks. Yes the game updates very slowly, but it's been consistenly updated. And yeah, there used to be a lot less content. Also a lot of the little details you just kinda miss unless you know about them. Such as the blood, various injury poses, critical damage spots, the ragdoll animations. It's fun, but ultimately empty right now. Honestly if it takes after Lugaru, the gameplay that there is now, is all there will be. Some platforming, and some satisfying combat. 6/10 for just right now, 7/10 if you like the type of game, 8/10 if you can appreciate the little details. Overall, above average to good. For me, I like it, it's quite good. But as I say with early access games, buy it ONLY if you're okay with the content in the game right now, and if you're okay with the Dev being a dumbass and potentially releasing a string of bad updates and ignoring the community (seems unlikely here, but still, beware).

However graphics are quite nice and a few nice physics fighting mechanics other than that i wouldnt say its even worth a £6.99 price tag yet. Not happy :L			",211,59,4,19,21,2,11

								This game is amazing and I advise everyone to just look into this game. Its amazing for the early access state that its in and one day will make for a very fun and indepth game. The combat of this game is the best I've ever seen, even comparing it to huge budget games with 100's of coders let alone a game mode by 4 people. This game is slow to get patches and fixes but its already prety solid. buy this game not just for the game now but to support the future of it.			",155,42,4,19,16,2,22

								This is a developing sandbox game, where you are a rabbit (there are other character models) and you parkour around. You can fight other NPCs in the arena, jump across sky pillars, wallrun, backflip, and probably a whole ton more of awesome stuff that I haven't found yet. Very fun and very addicting. There are bugs, but it is deleloping. (You also get Receiver for free if you buy this!)			",152,16,4,8,7,0,3

								Overgrowth is a unique 3rd person fighting game. You can parkour off walls and ledges; seeing as you play as a rabbit, you can jump really high and far. Even though it's in alpha, it plays beautifully. So far, there is no mulitplayer. But Wolfire has already promised the creation of multiplayer and a full campaign. It's fun to play around with the ragdoll and the slowmotion effects. I have really high expectations for this game, and even though its cost is higher then you might want to pay, I bought it on a whim, and ended up getting lucky. If it's fun as it is now, I can't wait to see what Wolfire has in store for us. And now it comes with Receiver, which i suggest you also look into.			",211,36,1,14,16,1,13

								So I got the Overgrowth awhile back , I had heard good things about it ,what i got was a game in alpha since 2008.Pros+Great Graphics+Excellent parkour system+Fun vs mode+Tight and nice controls+Detailed Gore+Decent modding communityA big gripe I have with this game is when a new update/version (rarely comes) is released ,only minor details are added.Cons-EXTREMELY long load times-frequent crashing-baron and empty maps where the climbing features are mostly wasted-can become really boring after a bit of time-Way ,way WAY overpriced considering how little content the game has in it.Yet ANOTHER thing about this game that angers me , you know how I said alot of the updates or new versions have little content? Its because the devs mainly focus on the graphics instead of actual gameplay.And some gameplay features that are added are usually tools or mechanics for campaign makers.Personally , I dont mind a game , even for bad graphics , as long as I can see cleary what something is meant to be , don't get me wrong , the game is beautiful , but what im saying is , the devs should focus less time on rabbit ear animation and arm systems and more time on THE ACTUAL GAMEPLAY. Overall , its a 4-5/10 from me, I cannot reccommend this game until the devs stop focusing so much time on the  way it looks , but hey , I look forward to its release in 2039 , because its seems thats what time it will leave alpha at this rate.EDIT: well it seems I can no longer play the arena stage, GOOD WORK WOLFIRE!And now I have more frequent crashes!THIS GAME HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPMENT FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS , AND THERE ARE NEXT TO NO UPDATES. I now think this game is about a 2/10 at best , an early access game In development this long shouldn't have so many glitches , FORGET IT COMING OUT IN 2039 , LOOK FORWARD TO IT IN ABOUT A BILLION YEARS. Don't even think about buying this game , just ignore the good things said about it , it will NEVER be finished at this rate.			",43,1,0,6,1,0,1

								I'd really love to recommend this game, but I just can't.Don't let my opinion sway you, it is a great concept, but it is incomplete, and chances are if it ever leaves alpha, it will likely be in a year or two. This game is fun for a while, but then it gets boring, even when you have someone to play with- but even multiplayer takes some setting up. I find myself not playing for longer than half an hour to an hour, before eventually getting bored.The physics and combat are great, don't get me wrong. It can be fun running around for a while and doing some parkour, but it is still limited. Very limited.I understand it is still in Alpha, but it's just like Day-Z Standalone- early access, £20 and feels almost abandoned. The only difference is that Overgrowth has been in Alpha for 7 years. Yes, SEVEN years. I am unhappy about this and I feel that I should be waiting for an announcement for the project being cancelled than a big update coming. The updates recently are small and unimpressive. 3 new arenas in arena mode as well as some bug fixing was the most recent as of writing. They don't even feel like they belong in the game- they are more like mods, and they can easily be replicated in the level editor.TL;DR:A great concept, but it feels like it has been abandoned, updates unimpressive and small, Alpha for 7 years.It is a good concept, but I don't see it coming out of Alpha within a year or two, and for that reason, I am giving it4/10			",165,14,4,16,18,2,15

								I wonder if the Devs actually take the time to read their reviews, but if I were part of the team, reading the comments on how slowly this game is coming along would really light a fire under my♥♥♥♥♥ I bought this game WAY back in 2012 before its availability on Steam and the game offered a good amount of fun for a while. I follow Wolfire on youtube and get slightly excited when an update comes out only for the videos to be 2 minutes or less showing how you can now turn on and off motion blur, YIPPY!So every few months, I start it up to give it a go, but I find that the amount of substance that I'm consuming is sadly just as much as I did 4 years ago, only with a slight glimmer on the graphics. My gametime on steam since it's come out on this playform goes to show that I play it for 10 minutes at a time and then it crashes and I don't touch it for a couple months.I'm very disappointed in this game that when I found it, looked like it could be a total masterpiece of a game, but really is just a polished turd			",63,3,1,12,18,1,4

I hope that this wonderful game meets the potential it has set for itself. My only fear is that the slow development might lead to this game being left behind in the dust as other indie titles flash past it.

								I'd really love to recommend this game, but I just can't.Don't let my opinion sway you, it is a great concept, but it is incomplete, and chances are if it ever leaves alpha, it will likely be in a year or two. This game is fun for a while, but then it gets boring, even when you have someone to play with- but even multiplayer takes some setting up. I find myself not playing for longer than half an hour to an hour, before eventually getting bored.The physics and combat are great, don't get me wrong. It can be fun running around for a while and doing some parkour, but it is still limited. Very limited.I understand it is still in Alpha, but it's just like Day-Z Standalone- early access, £20 and feels almost abandoned. The only difference is that Overgrowth has been in Alpha for 7 years. Yes, SEVEN years. I am unhappy about this and I feel that I should be waiting for an announcement for the project being cancelled than a big update coming. The updates recently are small and unimpressive. 3 new arenas in arena mode as well as some bug fixing was the most recent as of writing. They don't even feel like they belong in the game- they are more like mods, and they can easily be replicated in the level editor.TL;DR:A great concept, but it feels like it has been abandoned, updates unimpressive and small, Alpha for 7 years.It is a good concept, but I don't see it coming out of Alpha within a year or two, and for that reason, I am giving it4/10			",165,14,4,16,18,2,15

								Read some books during my childhood, from a series called Redwall by a guy named Brian Jaques. Twas about animals (Mostly consisting of Mice, with a band of otters and some squirrels who ♥♥♥♥ing love bows n arrers, and the occasional mole and/or some hedgehogs) in this abbey (based in medieval times with swords n bows n♥♥♥♥♥♥ who every now and then fought off raiding hordes of vermin, the likes of weasels, stoats, ferrets n♥♥♥♥♥♥which sadly are not in the game (Someday hopefully?), but there are rabbits (Though in the books they were always referred to as 'Hares'). And rabbits are pretty fierce fighters, Even more so in Overgrowth than the books but still just as awesome and deadly. Ever since I read his books I've always wanted some sort of game that was like them, this is that game. I love this game. You should get it if you like indepth unarmed and armed combat (And animals of course! Though you will be somewhat killing them.... But its a videogame :). I rate this game 10/10 for making my childhood dreams of a game with crazy ♥♥♥♥ing wabbits with swords come true.EDIT: If you ever feel like reading these 'Redwall' books, IMO Start with Mossflower, Tis my fav out of them all. That or Martin The Warrior, Tis also a good one.			",174,12,8,15,10,2,10

For example: If your in a mission where you need to defete all the enimies you can either charge in and kill everyone with a sword or creep in and choke em without any witnesses... Example 2: If you are on a parkour map they usually have multible ways of going around the map like Red Shards.			",30,0,0,1,3,0,1

								Seeing as how complex this game is and it being made a very small team, it's no suprise that it's not finished yet. My biggest complaint  is the slow progress of updates byt they are getting better and better about that. I hope it's finished soon but don't pay full price until it gets a campaign. If you want to see this game be made then I strongly urge you to pay full price. Game is currently worth about $15 so don't pay more than that if you just wanna have some fun with it.

								i finnally convinced my best friend and his girlfriend to play the vs mode with me in this, it provided about two hours of laughter and fun. the combat really is fun, and just to be fair it is one guy doing most of the work. I dont want to be too critical of him since it might give the guy anxiety and cause even more delays. i wonder if he has thought about getting a company like double fine to back him. this is coming from a berserk fan, but then again, the dev for this game is not miura. i think he should get a development team to help him and split the profits so he can start working on the next game, im sure in eight years he has come up with some new ideaas that he would like to work on. Gang beasts is similiar and just recently got updated for the new unity engine. i might get that soon, but i want to wait until it comes out of early access, otherwise i might have two unfinished physics based combat games in my library.

								This game is still not complete, the gameplay is really fun, no campaign yet, overpriced i hate to say, usually works fine with/o crashes, however ocasionally does still crash, fun sandbox(however kindof difficult to get used to), weapon physics are mediocre, lots of parkor, combat easy since all you have to do is hold down 1 of 2 bottons, combat still need to get used to do the AI being better at this than i am, oh yes ai is fun to mess with. As much as i like this game due to it being over priced, and the fact the games been in alpha for 6 years i cannot recommend this game til its either marked down on price or they finish the game(new) Alpha 207 has made the ai more fun to mess with and there are a few lines that turner now says(revision 219) The game has really seen alot of updates as of Decemeber 2015 ever since they hired new people, it is march and i think this game is finally going somewhere. im going to change my recomendation.

Early Access Review
								I completed the Lugaru campaign in less than 6 hours , it was short but really challenging , fun and difficult.There is also a arena , editor and many more maps you can choose to play on!The price is a little bit overpriced , but it still is worth it.Still don't know how just last week it got out of alpha.But ignore that.I am going to talk about the Lugaru campaign. Spoilers below. You start off as a rabbit by the name of Turner. Turner lives in a small , small village and your family is just chillin'. When you climb up the ruins , Turner will encounter April. She found a unknown rabbit that no one has seen yet. Turner decides to go to over that rabbit , and it turned out to be that the rabbit was a raider scout. After the conversation you did with the mysterious dude , he attacks you. Turner fights him and eventually he dies. Turner sees in the distance a traveller , and then Turner asks him if there are more raider scouts. The traveller makes turner follow him to a unknown location where you will get attacked by another raider scout and the traveller himself. When Turner comes back... Something really sad happens. Turner finds his whole family dead... What a sad thing that can happen.Turner promises to himself that he would kill every raider that came to his village. He continues to adventure out to find the base of the raiders. He eventually comes across a single enemy , and then he decides to take the enemy out. By stealth , or fighting. Turner gets into a desert and encounters again , 2 enemies. They are talking about the incident that happend to your family , and they were promised a ""war hero"" to where you were heading. Turner eventually take them out in stealth , or fighting again. Turner comes across a small camp of enemies. He takes them out in stealth , or fight. AGAIN.He continues in his adventure and then he comes across some sentries. Not the sentries that shoot... Enemies that look across the desert and try to spot any enemy.Turner takes them out. Turner , travels even more and finds the first base of the raiders! What a suprise. Guess what? He kills everyone inside of the base. The head-admin or whatever his name is comes into the base , finding out that Turner killed everyone. Turner fights the dude and he wins... of course.He continues his adventure and gets to the Rocky Hall. Turner talks to those people are in there , and he finds out that Willow is doing this. His friend betrayed him.Turner continues again his adventure and comes across a powerful , but weak Wolf. Turner fights the wolf and it was a challenging fight for him.He comes across a group of raider scouts. Turner kills 'em. He continues his adventure... again. He finds Willow. Fights Willow. Willow dies. Turner won. He continues his adventure.  He finds out that the king... was feeding rabbits to the wolves. Turner fights the king and he wins. He takes the king's sword and continues on his adventure.He goes to the Rocky Hall to tell these people that Willow's dead.He continues his adventure and comes across 2 wolves that are supposed to be guards. Turner takes 'em out. Easy.He comes across 3 pups of wolves , and 3 adult wolves. Turner kills everything. Even the pups! Cruel , cruel Turner.Ash , the king of wolves comes and starts to almost cry , why? Because his kids are dead. Turner has the kid's blood on his sword. Ash fights Turner. This was the most challenging challenge so far. But he stil succeded. He goes back to the Rocky Hall , and he gets to be on the Throne. He does not accept. He asks about Cats. He says:- What are cats? That is where , the campaign stops.Audio: 7.5/10Gameplay: 9.5/10Story: 8/10Characters: 7.5/10Good game. Sad it's still in Beta. ",111,12,2,6,11,1,4

								Even though this is entirely not complete - it's still an awesome concept and fun, even without there being a point yet.  The physics are pretty cool and the rag-dolling of the avatars is very amusing.  It controls a little like a fighting game, Assassin's Creed and maybe one other action title, so it's actually not hard to pick up and go.Right now, the attacks are a little unrealistic, I should not be able to punch someone in the chest and knock them out instantly - I mean... they're ninjas too, you would think they could take a few more than 3 hits...harharhar.  I never played Laguru, so I don't know much about the story-line for the character, but with the way the world looks and what I've read about the overall story, this game is going to just plain kick♥♥♥♥♥when it's complete.

								Why is it that 75% of Early Access games have no tutorial? I spent a solid amount of time trying to figure out how to start a game, then I had to go onto the wiki to figure out the controls. Solidly annoyed me in the first 15 minutes in-game. Once I got playing, it was a lot of fun. This game gives you a lot of freedom in terms of movement and attacks/blocks/throws. It's mostly sandbox, but there is an arena mode and several challenges. Challenges were boring/easy, but the arena was fun, due to the variety of fighting conditions. However, it was pretty easy to trick and outsmart the AI, even at the more advanced levels of the arena, so it quickly became a drag. Once a campaign is implemented and/or the AI is improved, I'll give this game another shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Look I'm just gonna get straight to the point.Is this game bad? NoIs this game a cool concept? YesDoes this game have decent graphics? YesBut.Is this game basicly a ♥♥♥♥ing scam? Yes, yes it is.Now I don't HATE this game okay? It was entertaining for the first month or two I had it. But after a while, it got really boring since there is really nothing good to do, and updates aren't adding much of anything new to change that. Now not only is this game boring, but I was most definately scammed by either Steam or this game's creators. I thought that after some time, it was time to get a refund for it. So I went to the game in my library and looked for the Support link. I didn't see it. I could have just been being an idiot, but I just don't believe that is the case. But I saw another option I didn't see on any other of my games. It was something along the lines of: ""Remove this game from my library permanately"". So I chose that. It asked me to confirm and I did. Didn't put in a request for a refund or anything, and didn't give me one. Just removed it from my library. And I will again state that there was NO Support option/link that I saw. Maybe it is there and I'm an idiot or it really wasn't there. I think it's the latter.TBH I don't think I'm getting my money back. And this game is $30 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars! Are you kidding me?! Steam didn't even reject any refund! Didn't even give me the option of a refund! I chose the option that I thought would and it screwed me over. Like what the actual ♥♥♥♥?!As you can tell I'm pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about this.Don't buy this game unless you want to play the full game when it finally comes out when you're in your 50's or 60's.

								I have been playing this game on and off for the past 4 months. It has consistently been a lot of fun, and i'm glad they brought it too Steam so it can reach a wider audience.TL;DR - Fun, very fluid and brutal 3rd person fighting game with rabbits and wolves, is definetely an alpha so expect bugs and a pretty good PC too run it.This game at this current stage is basically an arena brawler with rabbits and wolves that are somewhat ""humanoid"", there are a number of different preset scenarios with slightly different objectives. For example, reach the coloured block without being killed, which is quite difficult when there are rabbit guards with broadswords and spears!  There is also a proper arena mode where you are in an actual arena and will fight waves of different rabbits, this is random and will spawn you with either a friendly NPC or on your own and is a lot of fun. The fighting mechanic is pretty unique and reminds of me of kung fu movies, it consists of left clicking to attack and right clicking to block and shift to duck and roll, but it is very challenging at times and looks AMAZING when you finally master it. It also shows blood stains on the characters and on the walls when you get hit against them, and sound effects are pretty good as the actual hits that you manage to connect sound very satisfying and brutal.Yes the game WILL CRASH and yes it is a bit BUGGY, but overall the fighting mechanics are beautiful in action and it feels so satisfying roundhouse kicking a rabbit into a brick wall. The game also needs pretty much a dedicated gaming PC to run well, and i find particularly the areas with multiple guards wielding weapons to take a slight hit in frame drop but otherwise it's great and will only continue to improve as more and more content is implemented.

								Horrible game. This game is so bad, it doesn't even work. When I get into a game it immedietly freezes, but I can still here moving and fighting. The only way I can play a round of arena is if I turn the graphics all the way down and turn blood off, and even with that it still freezes. It won't let me play the game and I asked their customer support and they haven't answered back and it has been 4 days.			",17,0,0,0,1,0,0

								So... 0.2 hours. Not enough time for a review, right?Well...Lugaru... errr... Overgrowth has a lot to offer. It's got some excellent animation, a impact mechanic that is, AFAIK, unique, and some interesting parkour. Instead of a health bar, your character displays actual wounds, which is really neat. The combat is deep, I suppose, and I could probably come up with a few other positive things to say bout it.But seriously...There's no HUD - fine, I can live with that. No voice acting? Meh - many of my favorite games don't have that; who cares? But the text floats around in an ugly font like this is  Baby's First Unity Game, and that's just unacceptable.  The written dialogue isn't exactly prize-winning, but whatever. It looks terrible, and it looks unprofessional. That was okay for Lugaru - it was basically free. This one is $30 frakkin' dollars.The worst problem, though, is that this is indicative of the quality of most of the game. This doesn't look like 10 or so years of development, guys. This looks like a tech demo. You've got something really interesting on your hands here- potentially a unique experience with facinating mechanics and fast-action gameplay...But right now? You've gotta do better. You need to iron out the looks of the game, and bring it into focus. It's just not worth what you're charging in this state, and if this is what you call Beta, then I can assume the final product won't be a huge improvement. Not good.FTR: I got this through the Humble Freedom Bundle, a cause I support fully.			",136,39,2,32,1,0,10

								Quite frankly this game will never be finished. I have absolutely no idea what the developers have been doing but this game has been in development for almost TEN FREAKING YEARS!Lugaru was a fun little game that had a ton of promise. Overgrowth is a never ending series of minute updates with NO story content. Do not under any circumstances buy this game until it is fully released with a complete campaign and story.Since that is about as likely to happen as John Travolta coming out of the closet give this a pass and save your money.

								Overgrowth is a 3D Platformer that integrates minor parkour elements like wallruns and flips.  It also features a combat system that is fully dynamic to the player's surroundings.  I recommend Overgrowth of it's level and character design and innovative combat and physics.However, this game is still early alpha.  Do not expect a polished, rounded game.  It might seem so at the $30 price tag, but really it's just a sandbox at the moment.  A really fun, bloody sandbox.			",327,106,6,36,39,2,33

This game is the building blocks to something great! The creators are always looking for ideas other people have for this game. They slowly but steadily working on this game. An update every week!

								I've practically given up on this game getting developed any further, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying the existing game.  The story is pretty much nonexistant, but that's ok, because the core of Overgrowth, isn't story, it's fighting.  This game has the best melee combat I've ever played.  The bulk of the game is brawling with rabbits, cats, dogs, and even rats in endless arena matchs.  You can beat them into submission with your bare paws or hack them to death with a variety of weapons.  The subtleties of combat in this game.  If you get knifed in the arm, blood drips down from the gash.  Jumping also keeps fights interesting.  A well timed jump will let you kick and opponent in the head midair, and a poor landing will break your neck and kill you instantly.  While the game doesn't run particularly well, the controls are fairly simple and intuitive.  I'd say give this game a shot if you've watched the trailer and think it looks interesting.

								OverGrowth is a game that has few major features, but those features are PERFECTED.Those main features are the combat and movement systems,  the movement is (IMO) the best part of the game.MOVEMENT;its smooth, it really feels responsive and well made. the main buttons are your movement keys, space and right click. as slimple as it looks the movement system takes time to master. the wallrunning into jumps and mastering rolls without breaking you characters spine (more on that later int the combat section) is quite a challange bet when pulled off feels great.COMBAT:The combat isnt your grandpa's comabt. its hard, fast and brutal based on a skeleton system and not on a normal health system. as mentioned earlier you can break bones limiting your blocking ability. on the topic of blocking, you cant just press a key and not be touched. its done in a way that you have to block on time or the block will fail.GRAPHICS:its grapics are Okay-ish. but its early access so that cant be judged.TL;DR: its great, if you like movement sytems and brutal combat pick it up on sale, its abit overpriced at the moment but toher than that i am hyped to see what Wolfire bring out next!

								Ok soooo ill just make jot notes to help you guys out to not make the same mistake i did.-Been in alpha for like 6 years-Small updates every week or so-Outstanding melee combat definetly one of the best-has a couple maps but no goal-like a lot of people have said it can be known as a ""figthing simulater engine"" This game is good for a about a week but without any campagne or goals it really isent worth it for 30 dollars.The sad thing is it as soooooooooo much potential, when this game is completely finish (if it ever is) it will definetly be a great one.My advice: wait until the game is actually finished, for all we know the developers willl get tired of it tomorrow. OR if  you really want to experience the fighiting simulator get it when its on on sale because i swear to you it is not worth 30 dollars on any level.			",39,5,0,4,4,0,1

								This game has great potential, but is squandered by the lack of attention and constant updates that can possibly boost its sales. The mechanics are well thought out but the game needs more... game, for lack of a better word. It is riddled with bugs, constant crashes, and needs vital fixes to make the game better or at least functional long-term wise. Other than these things the combat is very pleasing and the movements feel very smooth. The ""gameplay"" is very addictive and weapons give the combatants a major advantage in battle just like in real life, so if a combatant has one you'll think twice about confronting them. I'd like to see mechanics implemented in the game that allow you to disarm opponents if you have the skills to do it. The races have unique skills and abilities to them that make them feel different from eachother but not uncomfortably so. Personally I think the Dog race is currently very strong because when confronted by an opponent, armed or otherwise, Dogs can perform what I like to call 0-Point Drop Kicks. Out of all the races, I have found that Dogs can perform this move the easiest. (Elaboration) 0-Point Drop Kick : When engaged with an opponent (hand-to-hand or armed), move one step forward to gain the minimun velocity required (for Dog) to initiate a light jump into drop kick. Succsessful ""0-Points"" result in the opponent recieving severe damage or in most cases, death. Keep in mind while performing this maneuver you have a high chance of self inflicted damage or suicide by broken neck if it misses of you land wrong.Things like made up techniques such as 0-Point Drop Kick and player creativity keep this game going, give it a try. Its looks aren't everything, but lack of content is.Q: Should you play this game?A: It can grow on you :)			",28,1,0,1,1,0,2

								This game is hard to recommend. I love the idea of this game, the concept, gameplay, and just... Everything seems really cool to me. However, the game is barely worth the amount of money that is being asked for. Although that seems to happen with games still being developed. The issue for me is, the game has been in developement for a very long time, there are update every so often but the game is still very much a work in progress and has only very gradually changed. BUT, this game has recieved a couple very good updates recently and the amount of people working on this game has apparently increased. So hopefully we are going to see a lot more improvement in the coming months or so. So overall, I think if you are interested in this game, you should wait for a sale before purchasing. I love this game, but I'm not sure if its worth 30 dollars at the moment.			",122,13,0,8,2,0,2

								It needs a lot of work done to it.It has crashing issues when i tamper with the maker.Its complicatedfor me to make what i want.I dont know why this is here if it isnt even finished and mostly usable by people who know to use the maker.Just because its in early access does not mean i should sit on my thone and not critique it poorly for the issues it has.just two tips for the devs:1: Make games that are at least better than just playable2: Simplify the maker system, i dont know what anything does and I dont like the game enough to look up a guide.I've said my peace.

								there is no way to describe this game other then pure gold. How many games have you played where you get to be a giant kung fu Rabbit beating the everloving♥♥♥♥♥♥out of other kung fu rabbits. and you dont even have to be a rabbit. you have an assortment of other kung fu animals you could be. Such as a naked rabbit, dog, cat, or wolf. And if you ever wanted to be master splinter theere's rats too. The game play is also quite intagrative with how combat works and even with free climbing. overall you' have countless hours of fun on this game I cant wait until theres a full campain.

								[Edit]: The devs are back, and this is a revolutionary time. The new campaign is a short, yet amazing, story. The badass combat has you kicking and throwing enemies over your shloudlers and kicking them until the slo-motion view comes over as they tumble and snap their neck.The parkour is fluent and ever so satisfying.It is worth it with endless hours of arena mode and modding if you fancy your custom needs.8.5/10Would snap rabbit's neck again			",61,7,0,5,5,0,4

								In the burgeoning days of Humble Bundle, Wolfire (who now manage the service) included in their bundle(s) ""Lugaru"": an indie title about a rabbit avenging his family against stylised, malevolent predators and turncoats. This is the successor to that 2005 title, in development for the better part of a decade (or more?). Anybody interested in Overgrowth should make sampling it their first visit.Overgrowth is, in my opinion, a worthy successor to Lugaru - but right now, it is a game in nigh-perpetual development: if you are looking for a finalized experience, this title should be avoided. Wolfire's YouTube channel maps the development cycle regularly, and there is clearly a lot of love being poured into this product by the developers - but the purchase, at this time, remains that of an interesting combat-sandbox title and the knowledge that you're supporting a (slow-growing) labour of love.

								Love it. Played the first one, Lugaru. Massive improvements to our armor clad hero, Turner, and of course those raiders with their assasin hoods.. Gameplay is very realistic, falling on your head can kill, enough of getting hit with a knife will kill, sword is a one hitter. If you use a knife, they won't bleed out, unfortunately.(Idea: Make the sword a two hit, so you can slice and then finish it with a nice stab to the heart! Also add a bleeding damage.) You will certainly be impressed. The blood is nice, reflecting off the sun light, giving it a more real appearance. (Maybe make a actual wound instead of just a red line?) The arena is brutal. Love it. A really nice detail is the breathing mechanic when they are unconscious or just a dead lump. (Hint: Watch their chest to see it in action.) Overall, I love this game. To those who say ""THIS GAME SUX IT's TERRIBLE!""  I say to you: You have a bad computer, or you just don't understand what it takes to make a game.  Anyway, I hope anyone who reads this will be encouraged to buy this game.  ~Many thanks, TruFurry			",9,0,0,0,2,0,0

								Seriously,this game is going to be one of the great open world fighting game where players can edit the maps,or even make a new one to enjoy..Even on early access,I would rate this game 5/10 for now for being a fun game just like Garry's Mod where you can edit stuffs and install mods,etc.So when this game is fully released,this game is going to be in Top 5 bestsellers.So here,there's just few problems I wanna tell for those who wonder the downside of the game right now.Ok so:1.Currently this game is not really made for latest OS like Windows 7 and Windows 8.So you might encounter the annoying lag caused by it.So that is the only problem I can figure out bout the game right now.Oh yes,before I forget about this let me tell you that this game is free from annoying glitches/bugs.So if you are type of person that would spend money and support this game during Alpha,go on cause you won't regret.But I'm not going to say that to the people who prefer to play this game after it is fully released and 100% approved.Trust me,this game worth the price and when you first entered the game,you might not now anything for the Arena things bout after 10 minutes messing around with the stuffs,you will get addicted to it..So what you waiting for?Get it now without hesitation and create your own fighting ground now!!!

								When you purchase overgrowth, your essentially purchasing a game engine that just so happens to have some pretty damn good gameplay. Overgrowth is still in development, so the framework for an amazing game is there, the content is regularly being updated by Wolfire. Overgrowth also has a fairly robust modding community, all of whom add to the fun this game has to offer. I totally recommend this to anyone who likes 3rd Person action games and beat-em ups.

								Who thought brutally slaughtering cute rodents could be so satisfying!? Overgrowth is a truly ground breaking combat game. Physics based, requiring precise timing and skill to master. Oh, and can every game developer do me a huge favor, and adopt the bleeding aspect from this game?! Blood drips down the bodies of the characters realistically, and once it reaches a spot it can't realistically flow down, it drips! It's hard to describe, but when you see it, you'll know what I mean!			",243,56,6,14,44,4,17

To those who say ""THIS GAME SUX IT's TERRIBLE!""  I say to you: You have a bad computer, or you just don't understand what it takes to make a game.  Anyway, I hope anyone who reads this will be encouraged to buy this game.  ~Many thanks, TruFurry			",9,0,0,0,2,0,0

								Don't be deceived. This game is going nowhere. So so so many years in the works and all you've got to show is a couple arena/battle modes and a pisspoor recreation of one mans hobby project from ages ago? Go F UUUUUUU C K yourselves. This is not worth the money.** So for the same price (30) as when I bought this game, this game's on humblebundle (which if you didn't know was started by these ""Devs"") along with a f*ck ton of actually GOOD, finished games all in the same bundle. Sellout ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, like you folks, are the reason so many people distrust Early Access projects.

								A buggy, unplayable mess, I got it for half the price it's at in the Steam store and I still feel totally ripped off, the game has no tutorial whatsoever, so far as I can tell the combat is just button mashing, as I understand from the other reviews it's never updated. The only single player mode that actually exists is gladiator, which like the rest of the game is appallingly bugged and poorly designed, if you're in the middle of a combo when you defeat your enemy you get insta-disqualified when the round immediately ends, which is especially weird when you're in a mode that is apparently 'fight to the death', so what exactly am I being DQed for, hitting a dead body? And sometimes your teammates just stand still and do nothing while the enemy beats them to death.The bigger problem is how often the game freezes, crashes, and so on, especially when changing between modes it performs terribly, since my PC can play pretty much every new game out on high graphics without an issue I can only assume Overgrowth is coded/optimised like♥♥♥♥♥♥The only good point is the graphics, which sorry, does not make a game on their own. Just seems like a cynical hustle of furries, looks nice for the promo pictures and trailer, get people to fork over the huge cost, horrible to play.			",371,99,18,53,69,3,86

								Overgrowth has the best combat system I have ever seen in any video game ever. The combat system is based on an acutal skeleton inside the rabbit. So like in real life, if you land on your neck wrong you could break your neck and die. This is the only game I have played where I can see an enemy, engage in a fist fight, and die half a second later (not even exagerating on the half a second part, you would understand if you have played it.) It is a really well built alpha game but at the same time it is an alpha so there is no real story mode or anything yet but there is an arena where you can fight AI.

								I could not, for the life of me, fix the shadows. They were so dark it was pitch black. I could not see a thing. When I was told I could edit the sun, I found myself unable to do so; double-clicking the sun like they said did absolutely nothing. Eventually I found a fix for the shadows, checking ""Use tet mesh lighting"" in the settings, but now it's so laggy it's unplayable. Ergo, I cannot play this game. Shadows are the bane of my existence in this game now. Seeing how I never got a chance to go beyond the tutorial because of HOW F*CKING DARK IT WAS, I can't tell you anything more. This was a HUGE waste of my money.			",53,9,1,8,5,0,5

								Overgrowth is a great game. Many people are saying that it is not worth the price, and that it lags too much, and some of that is true (that half about it lagging.) Overgrowth is a very resource intensive game, but not all the time. The reason I waited a long time to buy it is I was worried about it lagging. I don't have that good of a computer, and I worried that I would spend $30 and it would be unplayable. Honestly, the parkour and just running around runs as fast as possible, the only time it lags is when there is fighting or ragdolls. that was just for those of you wondering. now, I know the price is a bit high, but it goes towards keeping the developer fed. as far as I know, there is only the one dev, and he is spending most of his time working on this, so this is his job. also, as far as development time, yes, it has been in development for years, but it is pretty much a game. sure, some textures are missing, and it crashes more than most games, but the core gaming experience is there. Also, there aren't many maps at first, but that is easily fixed. just set up your access to the secret forums (there is a great/ extensive guide on how to do that) and find the post about the SUM launcher. It is virus-free (I checked) and allows quick access to hundreds of community-made maps and new objects.Basically, with some setup, Overgrowth is a good game, well worth the money.

								Pros: +Has one of the most realistic fighting systems ever created+Map editor/Community mods/Maps +Weapons+More humanoid animals +More types of rabbits (Guards, Raiders, etc.) +Great graphics and shaders+SPEAR THROWING Cons: -Map editor is highly complicated and hard to use, well for me -Frequent crashes -Lots of bugs -Stealth isn't as good as it is in Lugaru -Default maps are boring and have nothing to do in them except spawn in enemies and kill them -Wolves are EXTEREMLY overpowered. We're talking about unblockable one-hit kills -Arena enemies get massively powerful and become giants if you spam the spark-laser Overall, I give this game a solid 9.8/10. 4Hope this helped. Man, I never knew it was so fun to write reviews- ",68,9,0,8,4,0,1

								It is a real feat to use 3 GB worth of data to make something that looks and sounds this awful. I could only stand the awful recorder music for 5 minutes, the frame rate was terrible and it looks like something that was intended for a 2008 release.Which, given that the game has been in development for what appears to be 10 years, does not make it seem likely this will ever come out.I got this through the Humble Freedom Bundle, so I don't regret the money I donated to good organizations like Doctors Without Borders. I do regret the 5 minutes I spent playing this.			",65,24,0,8,4,0,12

								Some fun for two, maybe three hours. Very repetitive gameplay, almost no variety. The developing team is among the worst that I've dealt with. Since purhasing the game around 6 months ago, I have not seen one change in the gameplay, or more importantly, in what you can play. The only playable parts of the game are several challenges that can each be accomplished within minutes, and a game mode where you have to try to win over fans by fighting opponents. Also the $30 price tag for this atrocious, un-finished, and downright lazy game is absolutely ludicrous. I've purchased games for five dollars that I've gotten more out of than this filith.Stay the hell away from this game. Unless somehow, miraculously, the developers actually put some work in, and make it actually worth more than two dollars, this game is absolute crap and you should not purchase it.

								People will often say that this is one of those games that is in the so-called ""eternal early-access.""While it may seem like it at first, this game is actually in development, even if it is a very slow process.I would just tell you to ignore any of the posts saying that the game is done being developed, it is very much still at it.The game has a very in-depth combat system that is really one of those ""easy to pick up, hard to master"" things, where the player's combat moves are determined by their movement. While it may be very easy to just jump-kick your enemies to death, you'll find it much more entertaining to actually vary up your attacks, using throws, grabs, and well-timed roundhouse kicks.Right now, the game doesn't really have much of a point to it, but you can run around the basic maps and play around in the arena and practice your skills.I don't think it's worth all the money currently being charged for it, but it is a very fun game regardless.

								Best graphics i've seen in a while, Clean and smooth gameplay. Like mirrors edge but 3rd person and your a rabbit...Yup, your a rabbit doing parkour while fighting. A game like this doesn't need a good story line but it could utilize steam workshop to share levels much more easily. I have plenty of levels downloaded from the overgrowth forums but for the average person it may be a bit difficult navigating the maps and how to install them. The parkour is awesome and the combat is even better, you can use your stealth skills to the test or run out to your enemy with a machete. Maps and challenges that are given at the start of the game are straight up doo doo. The custom maps are the best aspect of the game. Even the mods, different playermodels, map customization and mods that affect the gameplay all help to make this game improve. I personally really enjoy this game and love the fact that the developers  DON'T listen to feedback and  DON'T have constant updates, *Cough* DayZ *Cough*			",70,2,1,3,5,0,1

Overgrowth is a third-person action-adventure game, and acts as a successor to the game Lugaru, developed by Wolfire Games. It continues the story of an anthropomorphic rabbit, named Turner, who seeks to live with a new purpose, after suffering through many events of loss and betrayal. As of 2008, the game is still in development, with frequent updates made to it.GameplayOvergrowth is similar to its predecessor in terms of the mechanics of it, with some major tweaks made to it, like detailed environments, improvements made to the context-sensitive combat system, smoother and more fluid animations, and so on. The player can make use of different weapons to neutralize his or her opponents, such as knives, broadswords, and spears. The game is still in Alpha phase, so one can only play the game in its Sandbox-like mode, free to use different character models, and try out different things like arena fighting, or environmental exploration. VisualsThe improved visuals are a huge stepping stone to making the game much more enticing to its users. Comparatively, Overgrowth produces a much fresher take on the appearance of the characters and the environment to those who are familiar with Lugaru. For an independent developer, this game must be applauded for its overall artistic design.ControlsThe traditional use of K&M is encouraged here, as the response time is quicker and invigorating. The combat system also works remarkably well with them. A gamepad can also be used, but I would like to recommend the K&M instead. StoryThe game just  But, so far, what we know is that the game will take place in a pre-industrial era where the anthropomorphic community now exists without a leader, putting their world in a state of anarchy.ConclusionFor an independent developer like Wolfire Games, they have to be applauded for their hard work they have put into this game, in order to fulfill what a player really needs in a fighter game such as this. I used to own a Non-Steam version of it, and I've stacked up atleast 30+ Hours in it, because I found it extremely fun to mess around with it, as a way to pass time. But, I will admit that it's been too damn long since the game was in Early Access. It would be best if one gets it when it's on sale, but do get it if you're into fighter games.  UPDATE: The game has literally improved in the past months, there's real progress here. There's Arena Mode, Versus Mode, and a Sandbox Mode. You're also in for a surprise as the latest update adds a little something extremely special and nostalgic for us seasoned Lugaru players.UPDATE 2: The game is now released in Beta. They've added and modified so much, it's been brilliant. You are now treated with a slightly different version of the previous game, Lugaru, play loads of modes and arenas, and the game is much more stable. ALERT: I will say that the game is still on Early Access, which means the full version has not been released yet. So far, I have not encountered any bugs, except for framerate issues, and a few weird glitches. Buy the game only if you want to support the developers. ",212,57,3,6,18,1,5

								This is one of my most anticipated games. I played Lugaru years ago & was addicted. Lugaru & Overgrowth have an insanely unique combat system, that is a blast & a half to play with. The parkour system is pretty good (a little troublesome for newcomers) great when you get used to the controls. You have the option of completing missions through stealth, all out brawl, bare handed or with weapons. There is an editor in both Lugaru & Overgrowth for the modders out there (Lugaru's is a little clunky, but with persistance & patients you can do some pretty good things). Even though I love both of these games so much. I'm going to say, ""DON'T go into this thinking Overgrowth Is anywhere near finished"". Overgrowth is basically just the in between a completed foundation & the start of some framework. There is very little content here(a few maps, a few obstacles to traverse & a couple enemies to toy with). Is it worth the pricetag? Absolutely not if you don't already love what this is going to be. Those of you that know Lugaru & see where David Rosen is going with this.... I say get on board, play with the new toys & give feedback to Wolfire. The community's support will only make this better. If you're sceptical, do yourself a favor & hunt down Lugaru. It's old & not pretty by today's standards, but it's damn good.******* I'm voting up not based on what it is now, but what I'm sure it will be. *******NOTE - The development is VERY slow moving. You were warned....... BUT IT'S GONNA BE EFFFFFFFFING AWWWWWSOME!!!			",819,184,6,73,31,7,49

								horribly sluggish update schedule with little changes mean that unique combat mechanics aren't put to full potentiali'd like to like it but there isn't much to do unless you download mods""WOW DUDE THE LUGARU CAMPAIGN CAME OUT!""you can beat the entire thing in 40 minutes nearly effortlessly. the wolves are stupidly easy due to horrible AI; literally jumping in place will render them unable to attack you. when your rabbit kung-fu game is beatable by mario style stomping on what's supposed to be a final boss with zero threat of retaliation you made a big oops :^)			",128,16,1,11,6,3,17

								Okay, this is a very fast brawler with amazing parcour. the fighting moves are based on real martial arts and damage is dealt on a skeletal  structure that is actually making the punches feel like they really hit. difrent to othe fighting games, this will not make the punches just go through your enemy put will actualy ragdoll them and send the part of the body you hit flying, draging the rest of the body behind it. the blood has amazing dripping fysics that enable you to get your enemys blood sprayed all over you. not olny that, but this game has a really good level editor! have you bought the game yet? no? then do it!

								Updates come once in a blue moon, but more so, the mods are abusive. Two times, I posted a thread that critized the game. Once, I pointed out how updates are as common as a black-white-asain ginger with boobs and a d*ck. Result-3 day ban, thread locked. Then I posted a thread about one of the mods pulling a DayZ or Goat sim, not recomending the game, when more or less it has no players. Result-Locked thread. Brilliant. These admins are dimwits, and the community will hate you, simply because its a bunch of lil fanboysRegarding the game, its decent. There is better fighting/platforming games,♥♥♥♥♥Creed and MGS come to mind, but really its nothing that you couldnt find better in any other games. There is next to no premade single player, so if you cant be bothered to mess around in the games awful UI to make something for yourself, your in for a 2 hour strech spent in the basic arena			",363,43,9,33,28,2,24

								Biggest load of over hyped crap I've ever played, doesnt even have a proper system yet that detects players and as far as sprawling levels goes, they are bare blank and unentertaining.I reinstalled after 4 months thinking it would be further down the path of development but nothing could be further from the truth.Combat apart from one preset mission has to be created by the user, good luck with that. I think the people who prasied this alpha must have been either on lots of mind altering drugs and seriously deluded or paid. Overgrowth = null			",97,2,4,7,6,0,1

								Visuals, Mechanics, and concept is great, but really I can't help but laugh a bit, it's a buggy mess and crashes surprisingly often, I know it's an Alpha game but since it's been in development for more than three years, I say this warrants a negative review, seems like the devs worked a bit more on the maps than the programming altogether, it feels like a rag-tag laggy mess of flopping ragdolls, even on lowest graphics, It could be my processor but.. There doesn't seem to be even much to process. It's a good thing I had 29$ dollars in my STEAM wallet, because if I bought it for the full 30$ I'd be a lot more angry. Theres really no excuses, the bad outweighs the good.			",253,35,0,34,37,1,33

Also as you get farther along in the game, the enemies get bigger and bigger, until they are 5 or 6 times as large as you. It is fun, but the extremely large rabbits are hideously textured.

								It's 04/10/2016... Game is still cr4p. Not finished and still in EARLY ACCESS. Just NO.It's 20/12/2013 This is going to be a review of a game that is not yet finished. A lot of people are saying good stuff about it and I have to agree with them. However there is one thing they avoid to say or maybe they feel emotional attachment to the game therefore they won't say it. I on the other hand will say it because it was my +/- 20 pounds that was wasted here. This game has a big potencial but the biggest ""flaw"" its it biggest ""strength""After watching some videos about the game I was really hyped about it. WOW! We need more games like this! Third person melee combat / action adventure ( perhaps later RPG dunno... its in alpha ). I was expecting to have awesome combat system you would expect from a fighting game ( like DOA 5 or SF or Tekken you name it... ) but it fails to fulfill my expectations. Combat is fluid yes but it feel unfair! Here's why :1. There is no tutorial at all ( maybe because it's alpha )2. You have only 2 BUTTONS?! One for attack and one for block ( so forget combos ) sure you have jump and crouch too...3. You have to be at the right distance from your enemy to perform CORRECT attack. If you are close you will either punch or kick with knee. If you are further away you will do roundhouse kick... etc. If for example you want to punch or do a swift kick YOU CAN'T!!! Because enemy won't stay in the same spot to let you come closer! SO IT FEELS CHEAP! I got so angry that the character wouldn't do what I wanted him to do because I was either not facing enemy properly or distance was too short or too long. So it comes down to timing and observing what your enemy will do while try to position yourself so you can counter.... This system doesn't work and causes massive frustrations.... SURE it's fast and can be satysfying if your character will perform well ( or actually do what you intended to do ).AT LEAST put a lock-on system for newbie players so I can always FACE the enemy and focus on either attacks or defending! ( Just like in Dark Souls ). Seriously there is no way to control whether you going to punch or kick... it happens automatically by judging distance. Other than that I have no problems with this game. Graphics are good for alpha and animations look ok ( but i would slightly slow them down ).... This game has a potential to become some special ( it would be nice to see really good campaign and possibly co-op whether split screen or online ). Tons of mods will save this game for sure. As for now I wouldn't advise ANYONE to dish out around 20 quid for this game! It's unfinished unpolished ( combat ) and there's not much to do. Save your money for triple A titles which are on sale! 20 quid for indie alpha game?! Seriously?.... So yeah I feel dissapointed... I hope it will turn out good in the end though. I can't recommend it just yet.			",229,23,0,21,14,0,10

								Don't waste your time or moneyEdit: Since people are getting butthurt that I didn't go into great detail as to why I don't reccomend this game, and apparantly not being able to read comments, here goes.The combat is boring and repetitive, the controls are awful, the content is lacking. And I know it's an alpha game, so I shouldnt expect blah blah. But for being in development for as long as this game has been, and as expensive as it is, I was expecting something fun and challenging. This game is boring and the load times are insanely high. I was following this game for a long time, and I'm quite dissapointed with it. I do understand this game is in beta, and the content the developers push out aren't on a timeline, but if a developer is going to put out a game that people have been following for years, charge 30 bucks for it, then so sorely underwhelm, then I feel I'm justified in not recommending it.

Early Access Review
								While the game is still in early access (at time of writing) much of the basic game mechanics are in place, and they work very well: the platforming-parkour makes scaling the environments fun and filled with energy, the combat is fast and incredibly satisfying (even when the computer manages to take you out with a single blow, it will be from a brutal, spine-breaking blow that will leave you cringing and not feeling cheated), and the characters are animated well.Currently, the game is just a collection of maps and scenarios, but you can also download user-created content or create your own with an in-game editor.  As for an actual story mode - not yet.  Also, while there is some same-system multiplayer support in the form of a single-stage versus map, online multiplayer is not supported (hopefully ""yet"").I have nothing but praise for what this game is doing, but here are the only warnings I have for prospective buyers:1) You might be able to toggle it off (I personally don't, so I can't confirm it), the blood in the game might be disturbing to some.  Many a person who saw the Watership Down animated movie might have flashbacks.2) The game is labelled as ""Furry"" and you do play as animal characters, although the game does not (at writing) take the game down the shameful paths that are associated with that infamous genre.3) The content is somewhat light without an actual story mode.  If you get tired of running around in the environments and fighting in the arena mode, then you will have to wait for another update before you might think of returning to the game (an issue fairly common with these early access games).In ConclusionIf you aren't turned away by the content of the game, you will love the quality put into this game.

								Overgrowth one of the best games I have played in a long time. The combat system is quick and meaty, and if you like it slow you can just hit tab. Their are lots of characters to chose from and smart AI. The only problem is the camera that sometimes can get in your way. All in all I would say 9/10 any day			",17,4,0,6,11,0,12

								The best combat system I've ever experienced in a video game. It's fast paced and very reactive while also forcing you to adapt to your enemies as they always attack in different ways. It's a must own if you love hand-to-hand combat and even some sneaky parkour as well. Now, I just need to figure out how to use the small dev kit to produce my own maps, mods, weapons, characters, and even storyline.			",112,7,0,7,6,1,1

								NOTICE: I like many others have played this game FAR more than steam saysnow the review,The game is a peice of art made by only 3 people (if I'm correct) that has a amazing combat system. it is still in early alpha so there is still problems with it.It also has a level editor that can be fun to mess with, i have built plaforms that are way up in the air so you have to break the other rabbits bones a lot or push them off the platform...If you want to play this game on good settings be sure to have a dedicated graphics card not a APU, If you have a APU you can still play but you will have to play at lower settings. Well except a few maps  that can be played on a APU but if you don't want to play on those few maps I would Highly recomend a dedicated graphics card, it doesn't even have to be a very good one like maybe a lower-mid end one from 2 years ago or laterThank you for reading my first review I actully put thought into ^-^			",117,9,6,10,6,0,7

								I think this game is great, fun, entertaining, and enjoyful. It is still in alpha so I can't really give a complete review but there is one thing I have to say that is not so good. This game has been a forever alpha (a game that takes multiple years to get to full realese) and has been like this I think ever since like 2011 or 2012. Overgrowth has much potential but it has taken so long to be realeased that you don't really look forward to the complete game, you play the alpha so much you get it out of your system, sure it's fun to play the complete game but by then you get pretty bored of it. Hopefully this game reaches realese soon so most won't loose thier interest in it because it is a great game.			",113,2,0,11,3,0,2

Lastly, the game has a thing called SUM and it is basically the equivellent to the steam workshop. It does cost $29.99 but I am positive it is worth every cent.			",109,9,4,8,14,0,6

								This game, although in early access, is one the best, funniest and enjoyable games ever. Who doesn't want to play as a giant rabbit, wolf or cat and beat the living crap out of another rabbit, dog or cat? Plus, there are a vast amount of open levels, an in development parkour system and a splitscreen mode! Overgrowth, no money wasted.			",152,8,0,4,9,1,2

								it has one of the best fighting mechanics i've ever seen and beatiful maps.even tho after a few hours of playing it gets pretty boring and repetitive, im sure this game will be a really good game and a must buy for fighting game lovers but not now, maybe sometime soon.and a multiplayer option would be awesome like co-op maps or versus mode.

								★★★★★ Great AlphaThis game is quite enjoyable, I'd consider the combat in the game a breakthrough. Granted it does have bugs and crashes occasionally, however it's early access and it will be interesting what will become of this game in the future.			",26,2,0,7,6,0,1

								This game, combined with a love for rabbits, is highly playable for me. Saying that, I haven't been able to play much as it used to crash everytime I started it. That was fixed with this newest update, and I'm back in the arena. Some of it, is extremely easy, while some of it is challenging. It shows promise and I would highly recommend this to anyone with the time to screw around.7/10 for its current state.			",100,10,7,12,26,2,24

								Great if you want an incredibly fast fighting game. My most favorite part is the precise skeletal structure instead of health; and the AI is amazing ex. fleeing from combat to get reinforcements. It also has a level editor and smooth wallrunning and climbing. overall the game has a huge amount of potential and in my opinion could have an amazing story mode. Lastly, the game has a thing called SUM and it is basically the equivellent to the steam workshop. It does cost $29.99 but I am positive it is worth every cent.			",109,9,4,8,14,0,6

								Overgrowth one of the best games I have played in a long time. The combat system is quick and meaty, and if you like it slow you can just hit tab. Their are lots of characters to chose from and smart AI. The only problem is the camera that sometimes can get in your way. All in all I would say 9/10 any day			",17,4,0,6,11,0,12

								The best combat system I've ever experienced in a video game. It's fast paced and very reactive while also forcing you to adapt to your enemies as they always attack in different ways. It's a must own if you love hand-to-hand combat and even some sneaky parkour as well. Now, I just need to figure out how to use the small dev kit to produce my own maps, mods, weapons, characters, and even storyline.			",112,7,0,7,6,1,1

								NOTICE: I like many others have played this game FAR more than steam saysnow the review,The game is a peice of art made by only 3 people (if I'm correct) that has a amazing combat system. it is still in early alpha so there is still problems with it.It also has a level editor that can be fun to mess with, i have built plaforms that are way up in the air so you have to break the other rabbits bones a lot or push them off the platform...If you want to play this game on good settings be sure to have a dedicated graphics card not a APU, If you have a APU you can still play but you will have to play at lower settings. Well except a few maps  that can be played on a APU but if you don't want to play on those few maps I would Highly recomend a dedicated graphics card, it doesn't even have to be a very good one like maybe a lower-mid end one from 2 years ago or laterThank you for reading my first review I actully put thought into ^-^			",117,9,6,10,6,0,7

								Overgrowth is the best Indie game I have ever played. The combat system is incredible, fast-paced, and most of all, fun. Since the characters don't have a set health; instead, each character has a skeletal system that measures how much damage you can take, allowing you to see how well the blood runs. This game is unlike any other fighting game I have ever played.It does have its downsides: the options menu has to be customized from the console... That's it... The only other bad thing about it is that not enough people have thrown money at this game so it could be completed.Overgrowth definitely recieves my recommendation! Buy this game!

								Even in alpha state this game is very satisfying. The combat is a fresh step away from the more conventional fighting approach. The fluidity of the movement and parjour is really impressive.
