												Being Penguins split up in up to four groups, throwing snowballs and Fish at each other trying to push the other Penguins off the island, is what this arena battle game is about. If you like cute looking games, Winter and Penguins, this game is made for you. And it's fun!You get to play on different stages, some more unique than others. One stage even have environmental changes like the latest Battlefield games, and the game's graphics are on the same level as the latest Call of Duty games. Penguin's Arena got powerups, making you invinsible for seconds, making you stick to the ground, throwing Fish dynamite and throwing Fish, that can be thrown faster than the default snowballs.You can customize your Penguins as you like them, giving them a silly hat and pretty clothing to wear. It's really cute. Who doesn't want a Penguin with Bunny ears wearing a ballerina skirt? Right, no one!I have fun playing this game. But sadly it's currently bundled with other games, making it pretty expensive to buy. But if you see it cheap, that's the way you want to get this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is a simple arena shooter. You controll a penguin and you will have to push the other penguins in the water by throwing snowballs, throwing fish, dynamite or some kind of cannon. The game is really fun at first but with the lack of players online you probably get bored killing bots after a few hours.I'd still recommend this game because it's quite fun if you could find other players.

												Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is a penguin themed first-person shooter intended for children, developed by Frogames[www.frogames.com] in December 2008. It's a multiplayer game where players try to knock each other off of an iceberg and into the water. There are four different game modes and each map contains five different temporary weapons or powerups that give the player an advantage. The maps are all very small, thus the rounds are really quick and furious.The online multiplayer of this game is practically dead and the artificial intelligence is not very good, often the opponent just falls off the cliff by himself or he just won't let go and the round goes on forever. If you want to buy this game, I would recommend you to get some friends to play it with you, if you play alone you probably won't have much fun. Also the game is pretty repetitive due to the similarity of the maps and the game modes, so it might get boring after a few rounds.Still it's overall a fun game with cute graphics. It's nothing special, but it has a basic and easily understandable gameplay and the powerups enhance the fun. There's even a map editor, which I really like. You can download it here[www.frogames.com] or download custom maps created by other users here[www.frogames.com]. Even though the game was released five years ago, the developers recently announced an upcoming update, so let's see what the future holds.Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is great if you want a short-term fun game to play with friends and nothing too serious. Also it's a nice alternative for children to the many violent first-person shooters. The game is only available in a bundle, which is in my opinion not worth the price if you'll only buy it for this game, but if you can get it on sale it's worth a shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is actually a great game. While the graphics are nothing special, the game play is simple, and the levels aren't very large - it's surprisingly fun. Basically you throw snowballs at other penguins and try to know them into the water, pretty straight forward.I bought the game with the intention of playing it with my 4 year old daughter. SHe thinks its a blast. Its a great game for kids to get aquainted with FPS (First Penguin Shooter... haha,) gameplay without all the blood and violence.No technical issues at all. My only complain is that there is no FOV control in options. The game is only available in the ""Action Indie Pack."" Haven't played the other games in it, but this was well worth the $1.25 I paid for it.Not sure how well online Multiplayer is, haven't checked that out and dont' intend to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PresentationPenguins Arena: Sedna's World is the kind of game that will almost instantly bring back memories to old school 90's gamers, and despite the fact that the game's appeal is as childish as it can be, that's what makes it even more interesting and nostalgic. There is no story here, Penguins Arena is pure arcade, and even though the days of minimalistic maps and limited abilities are long gone, this is the kind of game that still manages to keep you entertained for a while even in the absence of modern day game concepts. Getting into the game is easy, pressing only a few buttons in order to choose your preferred game mode and set the number of players, and after that you're pretty much good to go. The game's main attraction comes in the form of Teams mode, where up to each player takes control of an entire team of six penguins, allowing you to respawn if you die as long as you still have remaining penguins on your team. Aside from that you also have the Duels mode, where instead of having six penguins you only have one and the last one standing is the indisputable winner and the unlimited mode which is basically classic with an infinite number of penguins. All modes can be played against the AI, but the real fun comes in multiplayer where you can play against your friends or random people on the internet, and if you're really into bringing that 90's gaming feeling back entirely, the game can also be played using LAN Connection. As easy it is to set up games, as hard it is to control them; there's no option to switch the mode or map once you have started the match, so each time you have a sudden change of heart and want to replay a previous map in order to take revenge on your friends, you have to quit your current session and set up a new one, which can prove to be quite annoying, especially if you're doing this with friends and you want to spice up things a bit often.Rating: 4.5GameplayPenguins Arena: Sedna's World's gameplay mechanics might not be the most refined or innovative out there, after all it's a game about penguins shooting snowballs at each other, and even that simple mechanic has problems working properly sometimes, but that barely bothered me at all. The point of the entire game is to eliminate the enemy penguins by pushing them outside the map; each snowball you land correctly will push your targeted enemy a bit backwards, leaving enemies standing on the edge of the map highly vulnerable. As for why would anyone stand on the edge of the map, well most of the maps are small, so standing in the center might not always be an option and also when you are engaging in four player multiplayer there will be more penguins surrounding you than you can count, so you will always get pushed around, making falling off the platform at some point inevitable. There's a cooldown of a few seconds for shooting snowballs, so pressing the left mouse button non-stop isn't the way to go here, so in theory calculating your throws and using power-ups wisely should ensure your victory; of course that isn't the case for most matches, as some explosions have questionable outcomes, lag will often make you miss shots that should have landed in the enemy penguin and the AI will prove to be more destructive than helpful, but even with all those issues the game still manages to be fun and make you want to take revenge on your friends in the next match instead of rage quitting and that pretty much describes 90's LAN Games magic unlike anything else. Power-ups are the biggest game changer and even though there are only four of them, making you wish that there were at least a few more to give the game a little bit more variety, those that are there have a significant impact on the game, with the Mine pushing enemies further than a snowball normally would, the dynamite fish that once placed down will explode and send anyone around it flying, the fish crate that changes your snowballs to more powerful fish for a few throws and the egg that makes you invulnerable to enemy attacks for a few seconds.Rating: 5GraphicsThere is no good way to say this: as the game feels and plays like a 90s LAN arcade, it looks like one of those as well; the overall graphics are bad, but what is even worse is the repetition of environmental items, moving from one map to another is no big deal as they all look and feel the same and the only thing that differentiates one from another is the position of certain objects on that map. On top of that the number of maps available barely hits 10, as some of them feel way too similar one to another and playing for a few hours in 5 minutes matches will make it feel like they were repeating even faster. As for the visual effects, most of them are absent at all and the ones that are there look like everything else, brought back from a 90's - early 2000's PlayStation 2 game.Rating: 3.5AudioThe sounds that the penguins make might seem funny and cute at first, but once you hear them over and over again they become boring, because quite frankly they're the same for every situation you'll ever come across. Audio effects are just as bad as the visuals, with sounds missing modern notions such as tonality or pitch, but just as any LAN Arcade game you will probably play this one with your music in the background; that is probably the best way to go since the soundtrack is just as annoying, with the same song playing over and over again until you eventually grow tired of it and stop noticing it at all.Rating: 3.5ExtrasEven with all the fun it proves to be once you get past the game's flaws, considering the small amount of maps and modes available, it is impossible not to get bored after a few hours and even though the game does have achievements for the hunters out there, those shouldn't take more than 3 hours to complete.Rating: 3VerdictLet's be honest, Penguin's Arena: Sedna's World is not a good game, in fact it's a pretty bad one from every aspect, but it's fun and as long as you can find some friends to share that fun with you, this will prove to be a good investment in exchange for a few hours of arcade gaming.Rating: 3.9Check out the full review and a lot more about Penguins Arena: Sedna's World at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=248[/h1] ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What at first appears to be a bargain-bin-at-the-flea-market, I-threw-this-together-in-15-minutes-using-Unity-and-MSPaint sort of game is, in truth, a very in-depth deathmatch arena FPS with enough map control, bunnyhopping, surfing, and rocket jumping to make a pro Quake player cream themselves. You will not be disappointed. Rather, you will be blown away. As that is the goal, for you do not have HP. You knock your opponents into the ocean's frigid embrace to score frags.But for real if you have friends you like to play short lil multiplayer games with for fun, add this to your list. I was lucky enough that there happened to be a single server up with two other people on it who I played with for a bit, and it was good fun, but you'll probably have a lot more enjoyment (and actually get your money's worth) playing it at a LAN, or at least in a skype chat with your buddies.

This game was almost if not the BEST 5 bucks I've spent in a long, long time. Although this game's online play is close to dead, playing this game by myself was fun. if you want to play online, it's best to set it up with friends to get the most pleasure outta this. Loved the backstory and gameplay, it's simplicity is what makes this game a lot of fun. 8/10. I'd give it a higher score but the lack of an online community also this game can get boring after a while but that tends to not matter to me as I end up playing again over and over again.

The slightest error can cause instant death.-Purely optimized for low-budget PC GAMING ( I can max out this at 60 fps while running TF2 in the background, purely amazing)-It's well worth the pricetag for the bundle, you'll find yourself spending countless hours on this game and wondering where has gaming gone bad, where is the sequel to this gameThat's all, this review is not a joke.

												It's still being supported by the devs - this game was released late 2008.Us gamers are obligated to reward such good practice.Buy the game.  Enough of a recommendation? PA:SW is a simple arena shooter that plays more like a game of dodgeball you might've seen in American Gladiator; the fights almost feel like a match of tug-o-war at times. You're of the blue tribe (REALLY WISH YOU COULD CHANGE YOUR TEAM COLOR - THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY THING I SEE AS LACKING); Penguin Goddess Sedna comes to your famished people: Because of Man, there is only so much - which is so little - to go around. You, as a race, must decide which tribe has the right to live; all WILL perish - at least one may survive. Snowball fight for your life. There is a decent pool of maps. Some of them have dynamic elements (i.e. a glacier that slowly melts and breaks apart in pieces); several of them have vents that you can ride into the sky to better appreciate the diversity (and for tactical breaks).There are pickups scattered around the map: FishBomb that throws all penguins out of its radius, EssenceOfIce that grants you resistance to knockback, FullFishNet that allows you to shoot more rapidly, etc.The gameplay is pretty fast-paced considering the artstyle and your standard fire-rate. I'm fairly certain that when I first played this game last year, it didn't have the intro video from which I summarized the story - turned the game from a ""cutesy casual FPS"" to a gritty FPS that won't offend most sensibilities. You must lead your target more often than not. Playing against the AI, I have had (and watched) several minute long Duels (one penguin from two teams versing each other, after all others have fallen) simply because the enemy is very adept in dodging and easing into advantageous positions (that tug-o-war - pushing each other around, trying to get a shot off when they're close to the edge); indeed, so wily, I have thought to myself ""What terrible hit detection!"" False, the snowballs just grazed them (or went between body and fin) and I was just ready for the fight to be done with. It seems the AI is able to maneuver in the air far better than you. Maybe you have to be moving in a direction before you get knocked away to stand a better chance at landing back on the island? - I have watched countless enemies get thrown incredible distances into the air over the ocean, just to watch them miraculously work their way back to the island. I get thrown as they did, I'm barely able to get half the distance back to the island.Also, sometimes when hitting the opponent - and you know you hit them because their eyes grew wide - they barely budge (if at all), whereas you get thrown across the arena after every hit you take. I guess they got caught on the ground...?That EssenceOfIce totally renders the AI invulnerable to attacks - if you pick it up, at times it apparently only (slightly) reduces but doesn't nullify knockback from enemy hits. Other than the previous paragraph and the inability to pick your team (when you CAN customize your penguin) - and, of course, the insatiable desire for MOAR WEAPONS AND MAPS - I've nothing negative to say about Penguins Arena. It's an FPS (with online multiplayer) - popular(, very).It's cartoony - appropriate for all.It's still being supported by the devs - us gamers are obligated to reward such good practice.Buy the game.

Penguin snow ball fightsthis plays like a fps but instead of guns you use snowballs, fish, and bombs to push the others into the water where a surprise lurks.each group has 3 penguins and if you fall in the water you'll take control of one of your other team mates or if your out of team mates you'll hover above the ice where you can toss bombs down on the remaining combatants.you can play with upto 3 other teams in co-op or play the ai.

												Wow what a fun game to play! It's like playing King Of The Hill all the time. I liked it how in the game you had the choice to customize your penguin, to what kind of hat they wear and to what kind of belt they have on. The multiplayer portion of the game is dead, but it doesn't matter because its still alot of fun playing against the AI. The graphics are very simple. Its a very simple game to pick up and play. If your familiar with first person shooters this game will be right down your alley. To get all the Steam Achievements took about 3 hours to get. On one of the achievements you have to be the last one on your team and there has to be one penguin left on the other team,when you get to 1 on 1 there will be a sound of a chime, when you hear the chime make sure your the last one standing and you have to do this 50 times to get one of the achievements. This game would be great fun to play with other human players over the net so get your friends together and have a party. I loved ha			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Games are meant to have fun, and what did I get from this game!?Fun, I got fun, not instantly though. I played this game for a good 1 hour and I immediately regretted it, so inorder to redeem my gaming fun. I decided to play Call of Duty, the all superior game that beats everything, soI was playing then I realised every kill I was getting was a 360 no-scope cross map with no hitmarkers at all. Then I realised that this game taught me how to be Faze in almost every fps game I've ever played. Now though, it's even affected my life, whenever I pick up food from my cafeteria at school, I have to do a 360 which spills my foodall the time. It's uncontrollable, I can't sleep without 360-ing continuosly in my bed. This game ruined me.I can't hug friends/family. Noone loves me anymore. I can't pay attention to school. I can't love.Otherwise it's a great game 10/10 - Faze SpongeCake			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Penguins Arena: Senda's World is a really fun multiplayer game, but it's not worth your money.Penguins Arena is a multiplayer game where you play as Penguins and you fight other Penguins to be the last penguins alive.The game has an SP mode which is you fighting Penguins in an endless mode and most of it get's boring after a while and the only way to enjoy the game is to play with real people and this is where all the bad begins.The game is completely dead. I tried joining a server, but no one was playing and it's quite sad cause the developer has been updating the game, but sadly there's no point in buying this game.The audio design is also no that good, the soundtrack is really annoying and most of the time I turn it off when I start playing.The game is really fun, but playing solo is not fun and unless you have friends who will play with you, don't bother with this game.Pros:+ Fun gameplayCons:- Dead Online- Boring Solo mode-Terrible audio designFinal Rating:4/10 - Not worth itIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												This game has the strategic depth of League of Legends and Starcraft combined, with the fast-paced first-person action of Quake. This game should be played in tournaments and have live broadcasts and streams, not any of those other games.It also reminds me of Bomberman for some reason. And Club Penguin, for the obvious resemblence to Club Penguin. I give this game a 9.8 out of 10.I took a 0.1 off the score because it could use more customization options for your penguin. I want him to have a neon green afro, but the stupid developers didn't even bother to think that players would want that. They totally missed out on pleasing the neon green afro demographic. Maybe that's why this game isn't so popular. But it should be, because you can use clown fish as a projectile weapon. ♥♥♥♥ you, Quake railgun; you're outclassed as ♥♥♥♥ now.I took another 0.1 off the score because the story sucks. Yeah, I know. The subtitle ""Sedna's World"" is totally unnecessary. Sedna is just this penguin god that is in the intro video. The intro video that you can only see if you manually click to watch it from the main menu. And it's only like 20 seconds long, and not compelling in any way.And it's just, like, the icebergs dried up from pollution and heat and♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the penguins didn't know what to do. And then Sedna the penguin god shows up and tells them some cryptic♥♥♥♥♥♥with a grammar error at the end, saying really vague stuff that can be interpretted into anything. So the penguins interpretted it and apparently came to an actual conclusion. The caption afterward is like ""The penguins reflected on Sedna's words. They knew what to do now..."". Which is apparently kill the penguins that are a different color than you. Yup. Penguin racism. And they kill each other by throwing snow balls at the other penguins so hard that they fall off the iceberg. And they drown, I guess, because they get deaded when that happens. So that is the extended lore of Penguins Arena. As if a competitive multiplayer game about penguins knocking each other off icerbergs using snowballs needed any kind of backstory. Well, Penguins Arena gave it a shot. They missed that shot, but they gave it a shot. They tried. For 20-ish seconds, they tried. And that is admirable. Nonetheless, I, as an occasional professional amateur reviewer, feel that I must be objective about my critique and take 0.1 points off the score.Penguins Arena, folks. A near-perfect game. Here's hoping for Penguins Arena 2: The Arctic Civil War: Rebellion: Resurrection Revelations: Judgment Day: The Return of Jafar.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An educational game about the sedna colony of the penguin race. The graphics are spot on and so are the textures. The wars between the different races in the sedna colony are quite accurate and I can see there being a potential documentary to go alongside this game. Although the accuracy had shocked me, there was however one thing that was incorrect, the red penguins ultimately lost the war for hunger and the blue penguins had won, yet when I played it the red penguins won and knocked me off the edge, personally I find that rude, and historically innaccurate. All in all this game is fantastically accurate and deserves 9.5 / 10 stars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is the waaay under-appreciated ""online arena FPS"" built to appeal to the younger crowd. With solid, polished gameplay, it's suitable for any age or skill level. Penguins Arena is the fast moving, quick shooting Quake Arena to the Team Fortress 2 of kid's shooters. Charming graphics, refined and familiar shooter mechanics, and online play with humans or bots means you'll always be able to find a competitor.This is one of those games that if Apple or Microsoft had any sense, it would come pre-installed on all their hardware.

												You are penguin straight away from kid's show and you use snowballs to shoot other penguins to their death. It was fun for while but little slow responding controls soon made it bit annoying and that is something I did not want to feel when looking at those penguins. If I could give neutral to this I would because I'm not recommending the game but I did not dislike it either.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Childhood game of mine, simple concept with an thick coat of dust because of how old it is.Dont let it fool you though, this is a very fun game to play by yourself or with your buddies and have a fun time. Concepts as simple as playing on an iceberge as penguins trying to knock each other off into the water with various types of weapons.Pick this up for you and your buddies and have some fun, its worth it and gives you a couple hours of fun time.

												It very obvious after playing the game for a few minutes that either not a lot of work was put into the game, or that it was probably made by an amature developer. HOWEVER, this does not mean the game isn't good. In fact, while it may not be a masterpiece, I thoroughly enjoy playing it with close friends, and it's a good game for screwing around with your buddies and blasting them off cliffs into arctic water with snowballs, fish, fish bombs, and purple spikey bombs. I actually love this game and it's pretty good for its price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is literally how you 1v1 on club penguin properly by making the dankest airshots, and throw scrubs off the cliff with any possible method, so they can become shark food before they do the same thing to you.Fastest way to win is to use bombs agressivly.Teammates don't really matter that much except for the extra lives.

												For a Very small and Basic indie game party game it's decent. I wouldn't say it good but as I was playing it just a little to get the trading cards somehow i got lost track of time and played for nearly 3 hours straight. So if this piece is cheap and on special get it link it with a few friend and play for a while. This game does need go to a beta mode to get the steam achievement and it's probably one of the easiest game to get 100%. I was able to get it today when I just playing it for the card drop.6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is absolutely amazing. I used to play the demo years ago and I now get to relive some nostalgia. This game is hard to stop playing sometimes. This game is addictive, comical, simple, yet fun, and catchy music that can easily get stuck in your head for hours even when you first wake up in the morning. Despite the fact that the only way to buy this game is through the Action Indie Pack, the deal this week is worth it because it's only $1.49 for 7 games, even if you don't want to play any of the others.

												This game depicts the Club Penguin Civil War perfectly. No wonder the war went on for years and years; the penguins were using a pretty rubbish weapon: the snowball. Personally, I thought that the Club Penguin Government would have been clever enough to not use a ball of snow to destroy the penguin rebels, but I'm not a historian. I'm just a guy on Steam writing misleading reviews.Nobody knows why they used a ball of snow for years - the records and details were all cleared when the rebel fighters got access to a nuke.Serious: This game is actually pretty amazing, but only buy it if you like playing with bots.

												Thanks to the easy to understand how to play section, my four-year-old daughter picked up on the concept quickly. Where she would normally employ me to help her figure out the instructions to other computer games she plays, Penguins Arena's  how to play guide empowers her to teach herself. The fast pace action in this game makes playing it immediately rewarding. Other games my daughter has played tend to make her finish a lengthy trial (albeit with character encouragement throughout) before she receives her reward.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is an action packed first person shooter that deals tastefully with a lot of complex social issues, namely climate change. Don't let the deep mechanics and thrilling combat system distract you from the intelligence of this masterpiece; this game's maticulous crafting and stunning beauty, evident in its mesemerising map design and sound design, makes the roof of the Sistine chapel look like one of Ringo Starr's MS Paint drawings. This game was also far ahead of its time, and despite its age it has grown with grace and is still as relevant and impressive as it was when it was first released. For these reasons, I heartily recommend Penguins Arena: Sedna's World as it is unarguably one of the best games to be released this decade.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have no idea how this abomination got over 600 positive reviews.Multiplayer only ""arena"" shooter with zero multiplayer. Seriously, no one is playing this.""Arena"" is a peanut sized island where you get catapultet into the water and die everytime a returded penguin farts in your general direction.Rounds end in about 10 seconds because you either get thrown into the water or just commit suicide out of boredom.No animations - The returded pengiuns just hobble around.Crap graphics - looks like 3D stock models drawn in paintbrushCrap physics - It takes my returded pengiun 10 seconds to hurl his retured snowball at another returded pengiun.Annoying 'Surfs up dood!' 3 second loop music in an arctic themed game.Probably took me longer to write this review than it took them to make this game.Only play this if you're a returded pengiun.Final verdit: Smelly fish			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh yeah. Thats right. Ladies and Gents, what you see before you is down right combat and bloodshed in it's concentrated form.No one who has ever see that you may have had a hope that maybe, just maybe, you could get out alive can just forget it now. This is war. Not only is this war, but its a gang war; one of the most illegal types of war is gang war but dont let that get you down, son. Nothing can prepare you for what will go down on the streets, even if you keep your head down and check your corners and stay frosty, no one can be really for certain what is going down downtown pound town. You know?This game is about that head ho dog, Sedna, and her nonsese that she brings about. She is pretty salty that her big boy league was deciding that she was down to get settled on the retirement fee of what she really has done. No one could have predicted that she went and caused that the fallout of the supermarkets would crash and all the rival gangs would start fighting. The penguins returned in force and decided that they must fight eachother in order to unite once again under one banner, under one day, under one sacrafice.The day has gone that the world within the Sedna arena of death will rise again withing this day of the day of tomorrow. One day, you will understand how this deep lore calls out for a good day in the day of me. Nonstop fun for the family.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Penguins Arena Sedna's World is an extremely barebones king of the hill shooter. You play as a penguin throwing snowballs and other, slightly different colored penguins trying to push them off an iceberg and into the shark infested waters below. The maps are fairly varied with some being big arenas with lots of trees covering the edges making them long and sometimes frustrating to end and others being so tiny that a single explosion will throw half the players into the murky depths. Some of the maps even have collapsing glaciers that makes the play area smaller the longer the game drags on.There is no health for the Penguins your only weapons are the slow firing snowball and your rather weak punch. Your 3rd weapon, which is both the best and the most risky, is yourself. By running and jumping you can pick up speed and by hitting other penguins transferring that speed into them sending them flying with incredible force. Of course, if you miss or get hit when moving that fast you'll often end up killing yourself. You can also pick up various power-ups on the map ranging for a brief invulnerability to snowballs to a small supply of rapid fire fish or an exploding fish that functions much as a grenade.Graphically and musically the game is nothing impressive and there is no storyline, no voice-acting or really anything other than your basic deathmatch. The few different modes available only really allow you to change the number of teams in the match and whether or not your additional lives should run around as bots, fighting until you die and take them over, or simply be additional respawns that can't get themselves killed.Although Penguins Arena is a fun little multi-player game it suffers from a number of rather major faults. The lack of any additional modes means that it gets repetitive within a couple of games and the lack of anyone else playing it online means it's only really fun when you can manage to gather a bunch of friends to play with, the bots available in single-player are simply not up to par.All in all, not a game I'd recommend you get unless you plan to get it with a couple of friends so you have someone to play with and even then I doubt you will get through many matches before the repetitive nature of the game forces you to stop and go find a better alternative.

												I love penguins, so I thought I would give this game a chance. The game is basically a FPS with snowballs. You are confined on a little snowy island that spawns some random powerups around the map. It's very easy to get knocked off so be careful. NPC Penguins like to hide or cuddle the hills so it's almost impossible to knock them off. I do recommend the game for a younger audience, but if you're older, I would suggest something else. Cute sounds though. The yellow team cheats by the way lol :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game has quite a good sandbox feel to it, the leveling up system is good and no guns are too overpowered. The graphics are second to none, absolutely outstanding! It would be an insult to GTA V (PC) if you compared it to it.Gameplay is.. okay, slightly too fast paced for my liking, however still really good. The 'gore' effects when you hit another penguin is brutal also.I could see many people in the near future playing this game in MLG tournaments       8/10 - not enough guns			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Penguins Arena Sedna's World is an extremely barebones king of the hill shooter. You play as a penguin throwing snowballs and other, slightly different colored penguins trying to push them off an iceberg and into the shark infested waters below. The maps are fairly varied with some being big arenas with lots of trees covering the edges making them long and sometimes frustrating to end and others being so tiny that a single explosion will throw half the players into the murky depths. Some of the maps even have collapsing glaciers that makes the play area smaller the longer the game drags on.There is no health for the Penguins your only weapons are the slow firing snowball and your rather weak punch. Your 3rd weapon, which is both the best and the most risky, is yourself. By running and jumping you can pick up speed and by hitting other penguins transferring that speed into them sending them flying with incredible force. Of course, if you miss or get hit when moving that fast you'll often end up killing yourself. You can also pick up various power-ups on the map ranging for a brief invulnerability to snowballs to a small supply of rapid fire fish or an exploding fish that functions much as a grenade.Graphically and musically the game is nothing impressive and there is no storyline, no voice-acting or really anything other than your basic deathmatch. The few different modes available only really allow you to change the number of teams in the match and whether or not your additional lives should run around as bots, fighting until you die and take them over, or simply be additional respawns that can't get themselves killed.Although Penguins Arena is a fun little multi-player game it suffers from a number of rather major faults. The lack of any additional modes means that it gets repetitive within a couple of games and the lack of anyone else playing it online means it's only really fun when you can manage to gather a bunch of friends to play with, the bots available in single-player are simply not up to par.All in all, not a game I'd recommend you get unless you plan to get it with a couple of friends so you have someone to play with and even then I doubt you will get through many matches before the repetitive nature of the game forces you to stop and go find a better alternative.

												A cute game, where you must protect your penguin ""tribe"" by pushing all the other tribe members off an iceberg (global warming, people!)Interesting concept, fast gamplay which involves hurling bombs, fish and snowballs at the opposing penguins.Since Steam requires you to say yes or no, I'm afraid I'll have to give it a no (even with the pitiful amount of time I've spent on this). The reason being - as can be seen from other reviews - the multiplayer is a barren wasteland. The AI isn't much fun, and doesn't look like anyone is playing this anymore...I picked it up for free, but wouldn't recommened unless it sees a massive surge in popularity.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know what this game is, or how I came to own it, or why it was installed on my harddrive. I found another friend who also owned it without any memory of purchasing it, and from this I can assume that it is an ancient and horrible curse, spread through the digital platform known as Steam. What initially appears to be a cuddly FPS version of the snowball battling minigame from Mario Party is actually a creation hiding a terrible evil.
