												Before Crystal Dynamics took hold of the franchise, Tomb Raider was in dire straits. The downward spiral had finally reached the bottom, and you'd be forgiven for wondering if we'd ever see Lara Croft return to relevancy again. But just like that, Legend was released and all was forgiven, with a tighter knit, better polished, and more cinematic Tomb Raider than we had seen in years. The follow up, Anniversary, reworked the original TR with a modern engine and a handful of additions and fixes to polish it off into something that, while not quite the hit Legend was, set the stage for the final game in the trilogy, Underworld, which fully showcases all the CD was aiming for by combining the best parts of their past two games into a fitting end to their first run with Lara, and a solid game in its own right.Underworld is a direct sequel to Legend, which means if you haven't played the latter (and preferably Anniversary as well), you're going to quickly become lost in a sea of supernatural monsters, returning characters, and a plot that bites off quite a bit more than it can chew. All that said, it finally answers most if not all of the questions proposed by the last two games, finally giving Lara some closure for all that's happened up to this point, as well as for the trilogy, allowing CD free control to go wherever they like with a sequel. It's not going to blow your mind or keep you thinking about it after the credits role, but the narratives blockbuster mentality is more than enough to entertain and carry the game through to the end (provided you don't stop to think about why anything is happening alone the way).While Legends focused more on style and set pieces, and Anniversary on classic tomb raiding and puzzle solving, Underworld finally manages to meld these two halves almost perfectly, creating what I would consider the truest expression of Tomb Raider Crystal Dynamics has made. The mechanics themselves have been expanded significantly from past games, with platforming in particular getting a much needed upgrade thanks to Lara's larger move set, which feels far more natural and free form than what we've seen in the past as well as allows for a greater amount of variety in the level designs. The levels themselves have also gotten a boost, now on an outrageous scale that towers above you as you attempt to work your way through them, populated by more elaborate puzzles and a ridiculous number of hidden collectibles to find. Everything that Tomb Raider is known for has been improved and taken on a new scope, but in a similar vein, all the has been wrong with the series for years has been entirely neglected.Combat, though moderately improved, is still as mindless and unsatisfying as ever. The camera continues to be your worst nightmare, seemingly out to make navigating through levels a living hell and often sending you jumping off in entirely the wrong direction. Numerous frustrating glitches make themselves known throughout, from harmless bugs to aggravating mishaps that make progression incredibly difficult. Most disappointing though is how the level designs can often get ahead of themselves, leaving you scratching your head at the enormous size of them without the slightest idea where to begin. The hint system certainly helps in this regard, but it's an imperfect solution, and ideally one you shouldn't ever need to rely on.If you have ever played a Tomb Raider game before though, none of this should surprise you. As I said before, Crystal Dynamics has built up what the series does best, while quietly ignoring its issues perhaps hoping they'll be overshadowed or ignored. Personally I'm more than capable of putting up with these annoyances in exchange for the rest of the experience, but I'm definitely beginning to ask myself why I'm OK doing this, or if I should have to (the answer for which is obvious). If you didn't enjoy Legend or Anniversary you will find nothing more to draw you into Underworld, but for those who have yet to tire of Lara's escapades Underworld provides a fitting final chapter in this particular story of her life, if also a signal that it's probably time to move onto something new.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

Tomb Raider: Underworld takes you on an adventure through Norse mythology to find the lost island of Avalon. Beautiful levels, fun gameplay, exploration, and amazing visuals make this game a beloved addition to the series and truly worthy of the name Tomb Raider.Gameplay+ Puzzles+ Fun traversal/climbing+ Beautiful variety of levels and locations+ Easy combat+ Thor's hammer!- Puzzles can be irritating when you have to pick up items- Repetitive and sometimes frustrating combatUnderworld is like all the other Tomb Raider games in terms of gameplay. The puzzles are fun and challenging, the climbing and traversal is great, and the variety of levels, locations, and environments are amazingly well done. Combat is still the same simple lock on with right click and hold left click to shoot Thor's hammer was fun to use though, and while this is easy it can get quite boring and repetitive Plus those ****ing spiders are annoying as hell!. If you liked the gameplay in previous Tomb Raider games you will enjoy this one just as much. The main issue however, lies with the puzzles. Like other games you have to pick up a weight and set it down on a switch, this is nothing new. However a lot of times the game glitches and will either throw Lara far back, or more often than not, Lara and the block fly around the room making it just irritating to set them down on a switch.Controls/Camera+ Easy controls+ Easy combat- Frustrating camera placements- Unresponsive controls at timesAgain, the controls and camera are exactly like Legend and Anniversary. They are easy to learn and do what you need to do, but sometimes Lara simply doesn't do what you want her to do and while it's frustrating it isn't gamebreaking. The main problem with games like these (Tomb Raider, Uncharted, basically any game with traversal and climbing) is the camera placement. It just isn't always where you need it to be to see where you're going and again, it can be quite irritating that you miss jumps and have to restart because the camera.Audio/Visual+ Gorgeous levels+ Variety of locations+ Water well done- Graphical glitchesThe levels and locations in Underworld are well-done in quality and quantity. You travel all around the world, see different places and architecture, and the parts where you are underwater are just beautiful to be in and explore. There is the occasional graphic glitch but nothing gamebreaking, she will get stuck in the ground a few times but if you simply stop moving it normally fixes itself.Story/Dialogue+ Engaging story+ Interesting history and mythology+ Nice lengthI thoroughly enjoyed the story in Underworld which revolved around Norse mythology, mainly Thor. It was interesting, informative, engaging, lengthy and overall was enjoyable to play throughout the whole game.Overall/Quick ReviewUnderworld is an amazing addition to the Tomb Raider series and is worth your time. It has an engaging story line with history and mythology of excellent length. A variety of challenging puzzles, climbing, and traversal in an array of beautiful locations, none looking quite like the other. The combat, in my opinion, gets boring and repetitive as it is simply hold right click to lock on and left click to shoot while dodging and flipping. The main issue I had with this game was some of the puzzles took longer than they should have because graphical glitches cause weight blocks to shoot off the switch and to the other side of the room. However the underwater levels are some of the best times in this game and are simply breathtaking.Wonderful addition to the Tomb Raider series.Buy it. 9/10 ",55,6,0,7,4,0,2

												Underworld picks off right after the events in Legend. Lara is on the quest to uncover the truth about what happened to her mother Amelia Croft, and in order for that she must find a way to reach Avalon, a place only Gods are suppose to enter. In order to gain entrance there, Lara must track down the artifacts that once belonged to the norse God Thor, and these artifacts are scattered throughout the world, and hide secrets of their own. Her quest will come at a great loss, in order to find the truth about her mother, she could unleash a terrible evil upon the world. That is the story in a nutshell, and without spoiling anything. The gameplay is good, but not perfect. Camera angles get in the way sometimes, and the controls are a little too sensitive. The weapon fighting could have had a little more polishing, but it is easy enough to handle on most occasions, however, none of these minor flaws get in the way of enjoying this game.The puzzles are challenging but not frustrating, but I did find them a little more simple than in previous Tomb Raider games. The action and exploration are very well done, and the locations of the levels are sometimes breathtaking, from Coastal Thailand, to Southern Mexico to the Artic, this game delivers in spades on the visual department. It's a game with a  few years, but the visuals still manage to impress. The textures are all high quality, and so is the animation and particle system, everything you walk on or touch releases debry and smoke. Crystal Dynamics went all in when it comes to detail. Music is absolutely phenomenal. Orchestrated compositions fill the action nicely, and some tunes are truly remarkable. The sound effects are also at a high level, and another point of mention is the voice acting, which is believable and not over acted as sometimes happens. Highly recommended game. The Good-Great Story, Music, Graphics and Sound Effects-Varied locations, makes exploration a joy-Animation is particularly life-like and impressiveThe Bad-Camera gets in the way sometimes-Weapon fighting could have used some more polishing-Sensitive controls (mouse too sensitive) easily adjustable through the options screen (to a more personal preference), or by adjusting the DPI on your mouse, if you have one. 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*Gnome Seal of Approval*The third Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics. After some consideration and despite its flaws, I still recommend this game for fans of the franchise.Even though the puzzles and level design is no where near as good as in Anniversary (allthough Core is responsible for that one) it is still a solid game.My main gripe with this is the camera. It constantly adjust itself as if it was a ballon being dragged behind a running kid. So it will always pull toward the center trying to get Lara in the center of the screen. This will make her block your view. Typically you would want your character in the bottom half of the screen to get a full view of the battlefield. In this game you have to constantly pull on your mouse to do so. Annoying.The camera is also trying to be ""intelligent"" and rob you of the control at times which can be annoying. Personally I'm not too bothered with that, but it is a bit worse here than in previous games.Other than that, Tomb Raider: Underworld is an enjoyable game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the best one of the series up to the remake in my opinion, and especially fans of south-american, and norse mythology will get more than their money's worth out of this. The graphics can still compete with many comparable games today, and will demand higher system specs than you would estimate.I will say this though: If you are familiar with the ""old school"" Tomb Raider games, the game's puzzles will be smooth sailing for you. The game is fairly easy and you always have the feeling of being Superior to your enemies, however the landscapes, architecture, and atmospherical beauty in every single location makes this game a must-have for not only Tomb Raider fans, but also graphic afficianados, RPG fans, and intricate story lovers.I rate this game with 4 of 5 possible stars, but only because of its easy predictabillity when familiar with the franchise			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tomb Raider Underworld is the 9th installment in the TR series. This game holds true to the founding principles of the original titles. Tomb Raider Underworld has stunning visuals from Laura herself to the environments. Underworld's story is good enough to keep you interested as you make your way through the game. Enemies that you encounter are all but menacing as you mow them down with your dual-wielded pistols in a very basic combat system. The camera at times feels like a more formidable foe as you jump from ledges to your doom as a result from some awkward camera shift.Even though Underworld has minor flaws, there wasn' t enough to kill the experience. The game overall felt complete and fun to play. A solid 4 out of 5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent game, though the port to PC is a tad buggy.there is the usual ""Lara why did you jump that way?"" that occurs in all the games on all the platformsand then the menu was very buggy when using the mouse, i often times found it best to avoid clicking in the menuse and to just use the space bar and escape key to navigateExcellent solve-it-yourself puzzle game, great if you're a fan of games like portal that have the difficulty of a 27x27 sudoku board, with the game spaing little, if any hints. I personally managed to make it through needing only to look at a walkthrough once, and it beame clear that i knew what i had to do but i didn't know how to make lara do it. literally one point in the entire game, a ledge-to-wall chimney jump that gave no indication of lara recognizing it and seemed to devote itself to making me jump in the wrong direction whenever attempted until i found the sweet-spot in the walkthrough. now, about the in-game hints,generally helpful, though towards the end the standard ""what do i do"" observation becomes a lot more clear than the hints, not because it is easier to understand, but because it essentially restates the hints with more information. this point starts around the latter half of the mexico level.somewhat predictable story, though with the AAA games on the market nowadays people's intuition into story narratives has really been narrowed down to a very basic level, so if you don't play story-driven games that often or play mostly AAA games, the story will blow your mind, otherwise you will be able to predict a general amount of what will happen, which isn't always a bad thing. still worth playing, even if you do accidentally spoil it for yourself.Puzzles will grant you hours of gameplay, while combat will grant you mere minutes. DO NOT GET THIS GAME FOR THE COMBAT. the combat system is based on an extremely strong aim-assist that puts the standard crosshaire somewhre in front of Lara's chestal-region, without bothering to make the camera go to a better angle or making Lara transluscent. the aim-assist is clearly designed for consoles, and will feel a bit too snappy to different targets, which can be a real turn off if you want to focus on a a specific enemy, and the end of the game essentially turns into easy-mode. you'll know what i mean. It becomes so easy, that the developers chose instead of balancing the onsters, to just throw hundreds of the biggest enemies straight into the slaughter that is one very angry Lara Croft. Again, the combat will last you minutes of actual gameplay, and be a cause of about .0001% of your deaths.all in all, this is my favourite Tomb Raider game, on a scale including several different things i find important when playing a game. Disclaimer, i've only ever played Underworld, AoD, Legends, and 2013. ( order to play is AoD -> Legends -> Underworld, you don't need to finish the camplaigns, just the first few levels in legends and the opening cutscenes in AoD for the background story and references found in Underworld)cotrol responsiveness: 8.5/10camera-not-get-in-the-way-ness: 9.5/10 (PC port issue only tho)Story: 8/10, a bit cheesy but hey, Lara is like Batgirl and Catwoman mixed together with Batman's wealth and gadgetspuzzle CHALLENGE: 9/10, very balanced, though some parts will stump you on sheer mechanical issues, as they did mepuzzle DIFFICULTY: 5/10, most of the puzzles are actually straightforward, but not very intuitive once you figure them outFun: exhillerating when you complete a difficult puzzle, and when you complete several in a row without thinking too much you feel empowered, but it slowly luls you into a boredom, but that will be interupted by a cutscene, or a new mechanic, or an enemy, and bam, all of a sudden you are thrust out of the puzzle mindset and have to actually think again, making you frustrated, but eventually repeating the cycle. Drama: catfights. literally that's about it.Action: QTEs are unweildy and counter-intuitive in most cases, thank goodness they were left out for the most part. Combat is bleh, basicaly you just choose how easy it is to die when selecting difficulty and then just shoot the enemies before they hit you for the same effect on any difficulty levelspoopiness: not much, some levels give you that fear of the unknown, or helplessness, but nothing realy spoopy about itEngaging: very engaging, even if it makes you ragequit, you will pick it, or another Tomb Raider title up within a month of setting this one downCompatability: Playing on a 1.7GHz 4-core processor with 8GB RAM and a 768MB APU, this game ran surprisingly well on maximum graphics, though on a port there isn't much to change, but be careful when tabbing out, as this will cause lag spikes that will drop you from 60 FPS to about 5 FPS for anywhere between 30 seconds and 7 minutes. Don't panic if the loading screen freezes up, it only crashed on me once during loading, and upon restarting never game me the issue again. Later in the game, Attempting to manual save would sometimes crash the game, thankfully after the save. this was never a real problem for me as it usually occured when i was planning to *gasp* get off my computer /(*O*)\ and would save me the trouble of having to quit out myself. interestingly enough, a save game 5 minutes prior with n major progression or tabbing out would save normally, without crashing.V-Sync Recommended for more powerful computers. Works great on Win 8.1, unlike it's predescessors.great game, great graphics, great physics, great puzzles, most interesting story in the series, no weird fixation on torturing, beating, and killing Lara in frankly quite sociopathing ways *cough looking at you 2013* and actually did a lot of it's homework on Norse mythology (before adding artistic licsense of course)i would recommend this game before any other in the Tomb Raider series if you wanted to play from start to finish, as it is a great examply of the free-run and puzzle origins of the series, instead of being some ""Appeal to everyone"" flashy new thing that really holds no actual homage to the core of the series whlst attemting to create it's own origin story based on combat.

												It's good but...I bought the game as a pack on a sale. As a long time fan of the franchise, this is a solid title. For those who never played the series before, here are some things you need to know. First, this isn't the Tomb Raider from the reboot. The gameplay is a bit different, a little less cinematic in it's story telling but the game is still an eye candy that will make you stop to look at the scenery despite it being a little graphicaly outdated. It is overall a good game and I recommend it.That said, here are some of the issues that you may want to know. Because of its age, it is highly unlikely that there will be any new patches to fix it. First, the framerate. The framerate throughout the game is not stable. You will often find yourself with slowdowns under the 20fps mark. If this occurs to you, alt+tab out for a second and returning will usually fix the issue until it happens again. Secondly, I encountered a few crashes during my gameplay. Due to varying fps, I'm assuming it might be due to a few memory leaks. It's a bit annoying but only occured about 3 times during my playthrough. Then there are a few minor issues that I encountered along the way such as invisible collision (may annoy you if you are also the type to explore everywhere), a few camera collision and odd angles, a few streaming issues (unloaded textures until you are right against the object, possible issue if you are a speedrunner). The issues stated above may break the immersion and lessen the appreciation for the game but the overall experience is still enjoyable. I recommend this title if you feel like revisiting the franchise or want to see experience the series pre-reboot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An overall fun platforming-action-puzzle-shooter.I've played Mirror's Edge so I'm used to the old ""dying and retrying"" trial and error way the game works. You'll die, a lot. But it's mostly caused by bad grab/jump point marking on the developers part. If you go slow and are deliberate in your joystick movements you'll learn the mapping pretty well. The combat system does get wonky when there are more then two enemies on the screen. I recommend equipping the right secondary gun for certain enemy types to help stun them to buy more time for dogging around. Shotgun up close to knock back quick movers or leapers helps. The puzzles do not hold your hand in any way. If you need a hint you can look in the in-game journal but how you accomplish it is up to you to figure out. No detective vision here. But I found most puzzles to be fun and some were a blast to figure out.The music was fantastic. Each environment had its own theme and the ques for any sort of action or discovery were always on point. The story was good. I cant help feeling at the end of the game though that some key details were being left out. Or were rushed over in the story. In the end I didn't feel it concluded but wanted to tell me more and just, ran out of time. I have played this game twice and got just as much fun out if it the second time as the first.

												This is my first Tomb Raider since the 2013 Tomb Raider was more of a Action focused game reminding me a lot of Last of Us, Underworld definitely kept to the original Tomb Raider formula, but greatly improved. This was a very very good game, the levels , the puzzles, and graphics are all incredible. The overall gameplay was fun and challenging, It has that Portal effect, when you pass all the challenges and confusion you feel very proud of yourself. I had a lot of fun playing through the game with some fustration but the whole experience was a good one. But I do have to bring up some of the horrible things in this game, there are a lot of bugs/glitches that plague this game. There were many times where Lara would get stuck in places, you step in a certain area and you can no longer move, I had to use the grapple hook just to get out. There are some camera issues, graphical glitches, and some very weird times where Lara would go right through the ledge/grab point where she wouldn't grab it, she would just go through it. I recommend this to anybody who is interested in the classic style of Tomb Raider, the good far outweigh the annoyances.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PROS:- THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!  OK now that I've got this out.......- A ton of CINEMATIC gameplay and cutscenes including plot major twists- Drop-dead gorgeous graphics- Atmospheric score and realistic sound effects- Varied and immersive environment and level design- Intuitive (and improved) swimming mechanics- Lara's physical capabilities are much more realistic- Improved inventory system- Darker and less comical tone- Smooth and natural animations for Lara and secondary chacracters- Lara is an eye candy to look at regardless of viewing anglesCONS:- Earlier levels being too easy; overall difficult not as challenging as Anniversary- Frequent crashes during game saving (thankfully save files are not corrupted)- Random frame rate drops, likely due to memory leak; this is solved by ALT-TAB in / out- Occasional poor physics (largely resolved by turning on VSYNC)- Legend and Anniversary had instant loading; Underworld levels usually take 5-10 seconds..- Many more treasures (artifacts), but also much harder to find especially in open sea levels.- Lara now has occasionally wrinkles on her forehead----why?  Unecessary IMOEasily the best TR game I've played thus far; it grants an enormous sense of satisfaction as you progress through puzzles and platforms and more importantly, PLOT.  Yes, for the first time in a TR game, the plot is actually intriguing and captivating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You need to tweak some GFX card settings before launching the .exe to get this game to run the way it was made to. Most importantly to turn V-Sync ON, with the port from console to PC you need to nerf the FPS for the ingame physics engine to behave the way it was designed to. A lot of people don't give this game a chance because they ran a buggy game without really optimizing the settings. If you run this game above 60 FPS then it will perform very poorly with twitchy gameplay.I love this game and this is what Tomb Raider should really be about. Not killing deer to craft handbags or making a one-time campfire, or lamenting over tear-jerking drama. TR:U is full of puzzles but like it's predeccesor (Legend) it was rather short; I reached final boss in approx. 8 hours. There are still lots of places to explore and find secrets for replay value. I liked the new engine especially with the now-added gimmick to rock climb up a wall. Human combat was a bore but thankfully there are only two levels with it. If you like the original Tomb Raider games then you'll love TR:Legend, TR:Anniversary, and TR:Underworld (in that order).It's a shame that Crystal Dynamics felt the need to reboot Lara into a ""hyper-realistic"" girl-next-door. We were really approaching something great with TR:U. Instead of rebooting into a ""Last of Us"" copy, they should have just taken the AC:Black Flag route with an open-world tomb-raiding experience and a pulled-back camera. R.I.P this future series.

												A decent entry in the Tomb Raider series, but no more than “average” overall.The story and atmosphere are decent but not great. Most of the gameplay is puzzle platforming. This sometimes gets a bit repetitive, but there is enough variation and cutscenes to prevent it from getting too tedious. The balance between platforming and other types of gameplay is better than in TR-Anniversary (which was all platforming) but maybe not quite as engaging for the masses (and me) as the 2013 reboot (which had more action). The platforming difficulty is generally good for most of us, but on the easy side for hardcore gamers. I struggled with some parts, but always got through after a while. Some environments look really nice (Thailand), but others have rather bare and bland level design. The combat is fairly bad, as expected with this series. The checkpoint save system is also annoying, but not too bad.Though some of the veterans will scoff, I find the optional “field assistance” hints an improvement over the previous games that offered no help at all - now I am less likely to need to look up solutions online when I get stuck. There is still big room for improvement in this area though. At least there are difficulty settings for specific things like enemy health and fall damage.Lara's controls are a bit mixed. In some ways they are fine, but they also feel a bit nervous and she moves less natural (less inertia and animation flow) than in TR-Anniversary. As usual, sometimes the controls don't do what you want, causing many accidental deaths. Also, the camera behaviour can be disorienting, and the FOV is unpleasantly low. At least there is no mouse acceleration. The HUD is bad - you have to open your PDA to change weapon and see how much ammo you have. None of these flaws are game breaking though.Tip: To improve the graphics beyond the max ingame settings, i suggest forcing AF to x4 (ingame AF setting does not work) and AA transparency  to 4x supersampling in nvidia control panel.I would say this is a game to get when on sale, and only if you are ok with a lot of puzzle platforming.

												pros: varied and expansive environmental design, some puzzles are challenging and well designed, soundtrack fits the theme, all the women in this game look like hot ♥♥♥♥♥escons: derpy camera angles, clunky movement and controls, you can't directly select which rings you want to grapple/rope, boring story plot and underwhelming ending, terrible supporting characters, combat is basic and repetitive, and some puzzles I found wasn't executed very well.Overall, you will find Lara doing actions that you didn't want her to do because of clunky controls and derpy camera angles, causing you to die countless times. There is also no shortage of transformers buildings for your viewing pleasure. Although the execution of this game may be flawed, what it offers has value.Tomb Raider: Underworld has my recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the very first TR game that I have completed from beginning to end and considering the experience I had it's certainly not the last one. I love almost every single thing about this game.The setup and the overall atmosphere is either beautiful or epic and while the story itself is not the greatest thing, the gameplay is solid, the soundtrack is friggin' genius and the puzzles are well designed (they're not super easy, but they're not annoyingly hard either).The only not awesome thing that I can note about this game is that the camera is occasionally acting up HOWEWER even when it does, the devs built in a function which fixes it almost immediately. Don't move a muscle for around 5 seconds and the camera fixes it's position automatically.Onward to Helheim, I say!P.S.: I also bought the 360 version and it's DLC content separately, because I enjoyed this game that much. No regrets, just pure awesomeness.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 TOMB RAIDER: UNDERWORLD REVIEW When I got this, I first thought it wasnt gonna support my native resoloution of 2560 x 1440p, as of a game of this age would not be optimsed for a high resoloution as the happens with other games of the same age. But im glad I was wrong. It optimes it for my resoloution with decent graphics for its time and rarely bugs. A issuing bug However sometimes the game dips to 5-10 fps and stays like that, meaning you have to restart the game, but this is the only major bug I have encountered. Other people's problems People have claimed that this game is reptitive and buggy with bad optimisation - claiming it has poor camera angles and very buggy. None of this occurs wiht me however its different for everyone so watch out for this. My rig Im running  Tomb Raider: Underworld  at  60fps  on a  AMD R9 390  and a  Intel-I5 6600k  with  Windows 10  Overall statment In my opinion, I really like this game and it isnt very buggy and more of an adventure/action game instead of a typical puzzle Tomb Raider game, which you prefer is your opinion but I prefer an action type of game.

												TL;DR it's a good game with some fun platforming and adventure, but with annoying, frustrating combat.  Best played with a controller.The game's platforming is overall pretty fun, but it suffers from a LOT of problems.  Namely in the chamber where you'll get Thor's Belt.  Okay, so you get an item called Thor's Gauntlet.  It lets you move certain blocks for puzzle purposes.  In this particular instance, you move a pillar so you can jump onto it later.  The problem is that it's a damn lie.  Even if you try and jump on it (which would save you a lot of time and frustration) Lara decides that she doesn't want to grab the ledge, so you plummet to your death.  In fact, the platforming overall is pretty iffy.  More than once I’ve had to do the same exact jump twice, because Lara decided not to grab the ledge that time. If you're hanging from a ledge, you can only rotate the camera 90 degrees to either side of her, meaning you can't look directly behind her to see where you're going to be jumping.  She plays a special hanging animation when the jump is safe, but it’s really dumb that you can’t just LOOK.  The worst enemy you will fight in this game is the camera.  It is WAY too close to Lara, and it is WAY too jumpy.  Fighting any melee enemy, once they close the distance, the camera just goes bonkers.  I’ve actually fought enemies before where the camera doesn’t even look at them, it decides that the ceiling is a better place to be looking.Elaborating on the combat, a lot of the enemies are bullet sponges.  There are some in particular who are especially annoying, though.  Giant spiders are the worst ones I found.  They have a lot of health (even with enemy HP set to low) and they have a leap attack that has hardly any telegraphy.  They kind of shake their abdomen for half a second, then they leap at you.  Even if you see this in time, and decide to dodge, there are no invincibility frames.  The spiders leap way too quickly, so unless you dodge BEFORE they telegraph their attacks, you’re not going to get out of the way fast enough.This game is very, VERY buggy, too.  Maybe it’s because it’s from 2008, and it can’t deal with Windows 7, and newer graphics cards.  But in any case, it can lead to your death more than once.  I’ve had times where I get stuck entirely and I have to reload a save.The game does not play nicely with a mouse and keyboard, so I recommend playing it with a controller.  It’s still not perfect, however. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very nice episode of the Tomb Raider series which puts an end to the story started with Legend. I liked the graphics and the gameplay, but the game itself was too short. Sadly the DLCs remain Xbox 360 exclusive, I'm envy at the Xbox players when I watch the gameplay videos on YouTube. I feel like the developement was rushed as I noticed some bugs, but they weren't horrible, I could finish the levels without serious issues.I say, recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is best game in the trilogy, but its overall improvements are small. Each game in the trilogy improves upon the previous game, but the improvements are gradual.If you play this trilogy from start to finish, then you'll probably feel the third and last game is getting repetitive. If you play the third game by itself, then it will feel a lot more fresh and entertaining. The third game gives a good summary of the events from the previous two games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Review by xTzharkz.Tomb Raider : Underworld. Shortly: Great story, nice puzzles, good graphics, so so character movement, bad item (box) interactions.The story was built up perfectly. After playing Tomb Raider: Legend the story kept going, which worked for me, I was actually hoping for it. Seems like the previous storylines were all related to each other. But after finishing this one I don't see it going anywhere from here. Will see what Anniversary has to offer but I think it ended. Great story. Puzzles were not too hard but nice to figure them out. So it kept the mood up to keep playing, not to quit cuz rage or something like that. Also if got lost, no idea what to do, can ask for hint under Tab, which was nice. They had this relic hunt in there as well but since there were so many of them and they were really tiny it didn't work for me. Had no mood to look all of them. If had 3 in each chapter and something bigger would had been nicer.Combat system was kind of boring. New enemies which was nice but there was no challenge killing them. It was same in previous game as well. So yeah, they have still improvement space in that area. Secondary weapon was kind of useless, they let you choose one at the beginning of each chapter but ended up never using them. She had on autoaim that had 100% acc so yeah. Lots of tiny spiders came. If 10 then just 10 shots and done. No challenge, kind of pointless to add them then at all. Also her kick was so op. No matter what enemy got close, kick them, they fall on floor, shoot, if they still not dead, kick again as soon as they stand up. Graphics improved hellalot comparing to previous game(s). Lot of more little details, surroundings. I was really bothered by character movement. The speed of her actions were really off to me. Looked really odd. All wall climbings, jumping, you name it. Got stuck in the at between places and had to reload or kill myself with nades to continue. Also the interactions with items such as boxes, placing them on the pressureplates were very glitchy. Press E to pick up cube, it flew off nowhere or she went underground and appeared again. Placing cube on the pressureplate, it flew of as soon as touched it. So had to find that not glitchy spot on it. Overall, game was great. I am recommending it with both of my hands. But you should play previous ones first. Otherwize story is kind of off.xTzharkz [Eric]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply the most exquisite, lush, beautiful, immersive, entertaining, captivating, engaging, intricate, beautiful (did I say that already?) Tomb Raider excluding the Newest ""Tomb Raider.""  The water level was phenomenal.  Lara has never been so gorgeous.  This is without question worth 9$, even despite one particular puzzle string that can bug (look it up) but not at all often and didn't with me; I was just confused and thought it did, surprised when I read it actually could.  The puzzles are a lot less ridiculous than the old-school TR's in that there's a lot less BS like hunting for unending hours for a switch that's camouflaged exactly the color of a wall whereupon finding it you either feel the absolute thrill of success or feel unaccomplished like you just spend the past several hours on a worthless easter egg hunt getting older and deader.  Underworld, TR 2, TR 3, and the new TR are the gems IMHO.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Based on what other people have said about how ""bad"" this game is, I have to seriously disagree with that. I don't understand how this game is considered bad whatsoever! Graphics don't make a game, its the game's story-line and characters that makes the game what it is! Yet every now and then I see dorks who think graphics is what makes a game or just because they can't pass something they say its a bad game. Even though the game ""starts"" you off without a tutorial it actually teaches you tips and such along the way. If you need help with jumping and figuring out puzzles isn't that what walkthroughs are for? If you want to figure it out yourself keep trying until you get it or take a break and try again later. The Tomb Raider games obviously are for people who have to eventually stop and think on how to solve something in particular. I really enjoyed most of this series and I haven't finished the whole thing. The only issue I had with the game is the fact that there was so much water!!! I liked the classic running around, jumping on things, and not having to swim a whole lot. But other then that I seriously enjoyed the game!!! Just as I think I'll enjoy all the others.One thing Eidos hasn't mastered in Tomb Raider is the Human Vs Lara Combat. The combat usually feels clunky & unrealistic. basically stupid AI. But, before you look away and agree. The main thing is that this game prefers that you do a bunch of fancy moves, tumble around, and take them out quick. Do that fancy new kick in the groin then headshot in slow motion LOL. The better you are at this the more fun the experience. As for Animal AI it is better, but you will notice its flaws as well. There is also clipping problems for NPC & Lara alike. The story is interesting though, and the environments too amazing to pass up. Unfortunatly you do run into invisible walls, especially in the ocean, but most of them are hard to reach and find out about anyway. If you like to adventure more than you like combat, which is at the core of Tomb Raider series, you love exploring this world. new controls can be painful at times. I suggest a PC gamepad, if you can find a good one. I still like Anniversary the most, as far as story & gameplay			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To keep this short and simple, since very few if anyone will read it, and I tend to ramble and rant randomly, I'll simply list a few ways this title compares with similar games, from my perspective.I have played most of the TR games since the original on the playstation.  I always enjoy them to at least some extent, but often gave up on finishing them, rather than look up walkthroughs and strain my eyes and/or nerves for hours and hours.This game, however, I truly enjoyed.  I watched part of one video walkthrough, because of confusion, but it was my mistake as I simply wasn't fully aware of the inventory system (since I had the item the entire time, but am quite used to notifications these days.)  I played on the easiest difficulty, but that almost exclusively affects combat.  The new functions available made the fighting even easier at times, but also tempting to fool around with, resulting in Lara's untimely demise more than a few times.  To be honest, I tend to dislike the combat systems of tomb raider games most of the time, but looking back I can clearly state that if they had always had some of these abilities in earlier titles, especially the dedicated melee/spinkick/jumpkick/etc, I would have enjoyed them all much more.  To me, the best parts of this ""original/non-reboot"" Tomb Raider series, was the adventure aspect.  Earlier titles varied greatly in their adventure/puzzle/combat ratio(s) but never quite like this game.  Some was frustrating, even a couple parts that took dozens of attempts, but the issues were mainly my own.All things considered, the puzzles were quite easy, levels often quite linear, and plot twists that weren't often surprising.But the most important thing about each of those ""negatives"" is if you are comparing this game with others that specialize in one or two aspects.  Despite simplicity at times, the puzzles often required thought, patience, and were fun.  Any ""linear"" issues are irrelevant to me for this game, as it was more of an interactive movie, not an open world RPG.  And the story, despite it not being perfect, and often described as anti-climactic, felt more real and understandable than some big end fight.    tl;dr. enjoy it for what it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved this game. I have the other two in the trilogy - Anniversary and Legend. However, this one is for the PC, my others for PS2. To compare them:Story is best in Underworld, but also great in Legend. Anniversary I found did not have enough story, with a basic plotline, but I get it was a remake of a classic. There's always something happeneign in Underworld, cutscenes in every level. So many surprises in Underworld, and I like that it takes a darker turn. Rewards are not as good. There are a larger amount of treasures to find than in Legend, but I can't remember in comparison to Anniversary (are there more in Anniversary?). The rewards are all concept art and character designs. No unlockable outfits, bringing me to ...Outfits. Smallest selection available in the trilogy. You cannot 'unlock' any, but the selection is available from the start. At each level you are given a choice of 2 - 3 outfits corresponding with the location (you can't play with winter clothes in Thailand).Graphics are amazing. I love the difference. I'm not usually one interested in graphics, but this changed me. I don't know if it's just PC vs PS2, but they helped so much for me. Seeing Amanda again with better graphics really changed the game for me. Although, seeing Lara in some scenes she looks so much older!Moves have definately been improved. Lara is able to do more with the controls. More jumps, climbs, etc. Fantastic, everywhere. She can now walk/balance on the poles you only used to swing on. Weapons are interesting. With the entire selection available from the start, unlike outfits you can use them all anywhere. They all (except her classic pistols) have limited ammo, and ammo cannot be found throughout the level.Levels are a good length as well. They are fairly restricted (corridor levels), but it's better than Legend. Longer than Legend, not as big as Anniversary. Overall, this one is my favourite. I couldn't decide between this or Legend, but this is great. The story is so intense and exciting, even though ocassionally predictable, I liked it. It tied together all loose ends, and didn't leave anything hanging. The level replay style is quite different to Legend and Anniversary becuase once you have played all levels, you revisit them exactly as you left them so there are no more enemies (except regenerative ones) and the puzzles are all already solved. This is the Treasure Hunt mode. If you want to replay a level with story as it was originally, you have to reload it from the load option within the game.  You have to play the other two first becuase the story won't make sense (although you may get away with not playing Anniversary...). There is less human fighting than Legend, but there is some. You mostly have to shoot spiders and bats. I would recommend this to any gamer, particularly if you like a good plot, action, combat, adventure, quiet solo play or Lara Croft. Only negatives would be restricted outfit selections and the rewards.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I prefer more action-oriented games (i.e. Uncharted series). But this was an enjoyable change of pace because as expected, it's more about solving puzzles then shootouts like the Uncharted series.This game has nice graphics and design of environment, good sound, satisfactory cutscenes to make the story go along and make it not just seem like a game one puzzle solving level after another that I got from Tomb Raider Anniversary especially. Lara's movements are cool (e.g. melee kicking, able to jump off walls in tight spaces back and forth so it looks martial-arts like, can equip weapons instead of having to find them). There's a satisfactory amount of gun shooting in a game that is mostly puzzle solving and exploring. Norse mythology is used nicely as a plot point. And a big plus: the camera angles sometimes leads to Lara's nice♥♥♥♥♥ and you can choose her outfit and beginning of levels (her swimsuit in particular is eye-catching :p).Major gripes I have with this game: controls not 100% smooth (e.g. jumping to a moving object and she appears to have reached it but suddenly she drops to her death, and couple of times I was stuck in a random spot)And the camera auto adjusts so it gets really annoying trying to see your surrounding while moving.If this game was in the 100% yes or 100% no pile of games to play again, I would put this in the yes pile. I definitely found it more enjoyable than Tomb Raider Anniversary and Tomb Raider Legend.This game for me is a 8.5/10, a solid adventure game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my perspective I think that Tomb Raider Underworld is not a bad game and i think they should make an extra Game not ending at just THE 2013 Tomb Raider but also make an extra series and see how far the cast and crew members go with that idea. All in all my thoughts on the Tomb raiders are Terrific!, I couldn't hope for a better game than these ones, which are put in such extrodinary detail and great choosing of the characters to be put in the game. I want to give the cast and crew alot of thanks for making the game and hopefully they add more to the story in the game. Not only have I learned a vast amount of technique but learned also strategic obsticles and mind tricks too. The wepon of choice is outstanding then again the gun is kinda sad but more-less it's ok, and the Game is just FABULOUS is all I can say!, Have fun and keep coming up with more Tom Raiders in the future.

												9/10Each area is unique from the one before and after it.The climbing/puzzles range from easy, medium, and hard. Atleast 3 times I was stumped on what to do next but after looking around for a few minutes I was like, I wonder if that would work? I tried it and was like wow, I can't believe they were able to pull that off...only in Tomb Raider game right.The background story was good though I thought it was a little short. The ending just leaves you hanging. It felt like there should have been atleast one more area to finish the story.My only complaints are the camera glitches out at least once in every area, you just have to move around till you get the camera free. The game relies on auto saves and gives you the option to hard save. Every time I did a hard save it closed the game to desktop and I had to reload the game. Luck saved me from any corrupted saves so it is just a minor complaint.Last minor complaint is no steam overlay so no screen shots of all the great enviroments :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is very good. I loved it.Lara kicks♥♥♥♥♥as per usual. Plenty of outfits for her to wear so that you can enjoy the game even more. But I've become so emotionally attached to Lara over the course of all these game that I would choose the one that would work best in the environment (warmer clothes for when its cold). I tried my best to keep her from dying because seeing her die made me sad. The guns are good but all I needed were the double pistols. But other weapons served me well.Puzzles are spot on and make you feel really good when you solved them. There were some places where it was just lost but figured out anyway. There are fewer bosses than usual though which is undewhelming sometimes.Also I have a complaint about the weapon system. You carry all the weapons but you choose one big gun that you can switch to from the double pistols. You don't need to earn them like before which is a shame.By the way there are too many treasures that would only onlock some concept art. Too bad there are no achivements or weapon upgrades that are given for collecting all the treasures and artifacts. This would make me want to play more and collect all of them. But for now only 14 hours of gameplay.Steam overlay does not work with this game so I had to use DS4W to make my controller work properly.Still, awesome game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're a fan of the old-school Tomb Raider games, this is the last of that era.  No offense to the newer Tomb Raider games, but they just don't FEEL like Tomb Raider.  Tomb Raider should have very little combat, huge areas to get lost in, and the ability to make you want to throw your controller against the wall.Highly recommend this game along with Legend and Anniversary.

												This is probably the Tomb Raider I enjoy the most in the series.Graphics, puzzles and movements are pretty well (I speedrun this game, so I can tell movements aren't random).Camera is sometimes boring and the game has few technical issues such as random lags (Especially in the first area).As in every Tomb Raider games, don't look for a good story.The most disgusting thing is that DLCs (funded by Microsoft) are only available on Xbox 360.Anyway, This is overall a great game and i recommend it.

												This game is pretty fun, and if you are a fan of the Tomb Raider series or not, you will probably like it.The controls are smooth and easy to get used to, and the exploration is fun and challenging. Combat is easy to pull off as well. There is lots of treasure to be found and all kinds of secrets, so if you enjoy exploring, this game is for you.The graphics are beautifully rendered and pleasing to the eye, no matter what environment you're in. The story is simple enough for even a smaller child to understand, so don't worry about it being too hard to follow.Gear up and join Lara on her adventures to find treasure and fight her shadow today~			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So far I am really enjoying this entry, but I am old and played the originals when they came out. I have also already played 2013 and that being said never really felt like it was a true ""TR"" game, it just missed the mark for puzzles and vibes in my opinion. Underworld hits the nostalgia button just right, though I was sad to see they added the hints for people too lazy to figure it out for themselves. I've learned alot about Lara Croft during this adventure- mainly that she enjoys ancient tomato soup and playing D&D. Despite the glitches, clipping and dated graphics I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the series; unless you thought 2013 was amazing, then maybe you should just get Uncharted instead.

												Decent puzzle and exploration game. Loved the freedom exploring ruins underwater, totally worth playing for... BUT game reminds me of Dead Space 3 (also a third person game) where you had real fun navigating outer space, but the rest of the game was just too linear and oppressive. Also like DS3 the camera and controls are your main enemy. To be honest this game has the worst camera movement in any game I have ever played, just fecking nope. In combat, the game becomes like havigating a nightmare drunk and with a severe case of MS. The enemies are dumb and yawn-inspiring, give me the bears and tigers from Tomb Raider 96, no contest. A few glitches and bugs (some glaring), and tedious trial and error on some maps. At least the graphics are nice, and the story is nice, and the animation for Lara is great. 5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buy the game if you are a fan of the series, if not: buy Tombraider: legend or something instead!+ Nice graphics for its time+ nice animations+ pretty good and interesting story+ contains challenging puzzles+ different climates+ improved combat system- 10 hours or less gameplay, some of them will be spend on the same action over and over again.- Lara will die an awful lot of times because of weird camera angles, low health in general or by failing to obey the gamers actions, combine this with badly placed checkpoints and you will be forced to repeat a whole bunch of actions over and over again, which can be very frustrating.I don't really know what to think of the game, I liked it because i played some games of the series in the past, but this one slightly dissapointed me... If you are considering to buy a game of these series for the first time, please look at other tombraider-titles before playing this one.**************************SPOILER ALERT********************************************-no bossbattles/anticlimax, The story builds up to the point that Lara has to aquire Thors hammer in order to defeat an evil goddes, after getting the hammer, Lara kills the goddes by simply throwing the hammer at her in a cutscene. The goddes instantly dies and her evil world-destroying tower falls apart haha, after that there is a vague reference to Tombraider Legend (excalibur) that doesn't make sense(to me) followed by the credits.

												I enjoyed the story and I really enjoyed the parkour type places in the game. They added a couple new jumping mechanics on top of the ones from tomb raider legend. The puzzles were well designed as I felt challenged, taking a while to figure them out, but no so frustrating that I wanted to give up.Here comes the big BUT.They didn't fix the terrible camera tracking while climbing. You often find yourself having to blindly jump backwards because the camera angle wont allow you to turn far enough to see where to jump to next.Also, a lot of the time throughout the climbing bits of the game I found Lara didn't respond to where I wanted to jump to and would often just jump off in some random direction resulting in a falling death. Which did get pretty frustrating, especially if you've been climbing for some time and been making progress.Overall, I enjoyed parts of the game, but it got pretty frustrating at some points with poor mechanics.

Introduction : Tomb Raider : Underworld , probably the only game that can make you puke .. literally ..(+)Graphics : Graphics are again improved comparing to Tomb Raider : Legend and Tomb Raider : Anniversary . This time we get to see even more detailed world and characters , you'll notice the difference as soon as the game starts .(~)Musics / Soundtracks :  Soundtracks are alright , but not as good as the earlier games . In the earlier games you could feel the adrenaline increasing as you jump on to the edges and ledges . Sadly i couldn't feel the same adrenaline playing while i did epic stuff .(+)Cutscenes :  Cutscenes have also increased to those of the earlier games . They are now better executed with the improved graphics and particle systems . (-)Story :  Story is not better to that of the Tomb Raider:Legend , nor it is different . It's literally the same thing , except this time you are looking for a different artifact .(+)Content :  The content is pretty much the same as the Tomb Raider : Legend . Nothing different here , Still the same old Lara Croft raiding tombs .(~)Gameplay :  Gameplay has been improved significantly . Here are some Pros and Cons ;PROS :   + You can now choose your weapons at the start of a level , or during the game by pressing ""Tab""        and opening your PDA.  + You can now scan your surrounding for the treasures or special items required to get past some   puzzles by using the newly added feature "" Sonar Map "".  + You can now use the Field Assistance by opening your PDA to get help when you are stuck at a   puzzle .CONS  - Grappling system has changed . You can no longer double press 'space' and automaticly grapple ,   you need to throw your grapple by pressing ""Q"" and then press space to hang . Which makes it really   difficult for fast grappling and moving .  - Camera .. It's horrible .. Look down below .  - ""You're not authorized to overwrite save files"" What ? you mean i can't overwrite my save files , i   need to just keep making new and new save files until i am out of them ?? What happens then ?     - Jumps off a 2 feet tall stone block , dies !!(-)Camera Controls :  Why ?? Why did you have to do this ??The Camera is simply HORRIBLE. Honestly it shakes off so much you'll be feeling dizzy and nauseous . I almost , ALMOST puked all over the damn pc because my head was about to explode when i finally decided to take a break after 30 minutes .When grabbing a ledge , dropping from a ledge , simply running , grappling , everywhere ! Everywhere it keeps shaking like a drunk cameraman is recording and it's unbearable .So yeah , Graphics , Soundtracks , Content , Gameplay all is well or at least bearable . But the camera is simply horrible and makes the game unplayable(for me at least) . Unless you are cross-eyed , then you should be fine .. If not , there is a high possibility that this game might make you one .4/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Tomb Raider games from Crystal Dynamics are all solid and have their better and worse moments. This one is probably my favourite (Legend and Anniversary are also very good -- The Guardian of Light is great, and the new TR is amazing, too) of the trilogy, has fantastic levels that look absolutely gorgeous, its fun to play, the plaforming is enjoyable (your worst enemy is the camera tho), the combat is somewhat forgettable and the puzzles are good too.

												I used to own this game (and finished it) when it first came out5 years ago, but it was lost and, once I saw it on here, I had to get it again! At $9.99, the game is more than worth it. I'm happy they rebooted the series with the new Tomb Raider (see my other reviews for that), but this one still stands out. Great graphics (especially for a 5 year old game!), awesome (and sometimes extremely difficult) puzzles, and a good story. If you're looking for a shooter, this game's not for you, even though there's plenty of shooting to be found. This game is all about figuring stuff out. Sometimes just getting from ""here"" to ""there"" is a challenge, and it can feel silly, but once you get ""there"" and look back and see where you started from, it's a satisfaction you can't find in any other series. I highly recommend all of the Tomb Raider series, especially the newest. Yeah, Lara's hot, and if that's why you're playing the game, you're missing out. Just a great game all around, although some of the puzzles are just really ridiculous. 4 out of 5.  Definitely worth the time and money!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR It is okay 7/10This was actually the first Tomb Raider game I played to completion. The game does feature some awesome enviroments and some of the puzzles are actually pretty great. The combat is simple and clearly not the main focus of the game; that is until the end when it becomes a tedious shooting gallery. I felt as if the camera was my biggest enemy for most of the game as sometimes it has a SERIOUSLY hard time keeping up. You will die because of it.The story is simply an excuse to take you to these different environments. In other words it is fairly predictable and lacks any complexity to make it worthwhile or interesting. The puzzles are most definitely the highlight of this game as it makes up the majority of the duration spent playing. Entire levels can be devoted to these puzzles and they can be massive in scale (think an uncharted game). The camera will ruin some of these puzzles and can be an exercise in frustration. The game however, features no real incentive to play through again unless you want to clear on a higher difficulty or play through the ""Treasure Hunt"" mode. In this mode you simply replay through the game without many of the enemies killed and all the puzzles solved, but collecting everything becomes boring extremely fast as their is A LOT.Perfect game to pick up if on sale as it is consistently marked down to 2.50$. DO NOT buy at full price, not worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GREAT game!  This is one of those I bought years ago and just never got around to playing.  It is MAD fun!  It's a lot different from your games of today, with not a lot of shooting.  It's more about exploring, solving puzzles, jumping from ledge to ledge, etc.  Also, if you have Nvidia 3D vision, you're in for a treat as this game is AWESOME in 3D.  I'm running at 85% depth, and there is very little ghosting, even on the outdoor stages.  Can't go wrong with this one!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game which looks like the start of a hentai comic! This game is perfect for guys who don't have a real girlfriend! Its cut scenes always emphasise Lara's asset e.g. her eyes! On a serious note ... I have enjoyed playing this game as I love the idea of Cliche action heros going through maze after puzzle after maze, though this game is repetive it gets away with it for being classic Tomb Raider!

												This is a decent game, not as exciting as the earlier once or the most recent Tomb Raider but.. decent. It's not the best money I've ever spent on a game but certainly not the worst. Took me around 10h to complete the game which also is quite decent. I did not rush it so I'm pretty sure you can beat it in a much faster time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really enjoyed this game! It’s come the closest to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. In some ways the exploration surpasses Prince of Persia. The ruins were a more complex and the controls lent themselves to lots of viable ways to traverse them. There was usually a single intended path but clever jumping would sometimes be rewarded. Unfortunately, this freedom also meant that there were lots of ways to die. I frequently jumped at the wrong places, or wrong moments, or just had the controls betray me as I tried to make a tricky jump. I also enjoyed the combat in this game. It was a lot less stressful than a third person shooter, and once I got the hang of the special abilities I found it be a good change of pace from the exploration. It was fairly easy, and I felt like a lot of the concepts were poorly explained, such as how ammo works with the special weapons.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So far, I've really enjoyed the Tomb Raider HD trilogy, and this entry is no exception. Polished and streamlined to a major degree, this game takes what makes the previous two games so good and ramps it up. The only thing I hate about this game is the spastic camera system and the rather disappointing finale. They don't ruin the game by any means, but they do hamper an otherwise fantastic game.Also, be prepared for a few bugs and glitches. There's nothing game-breaking, just issues with collision detection and Lara dying randomly, which ended up being more hilarious than inconvenient.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are TR fan, or just butt-cam fan, this might be good.Controls are clearly for a controller, camera is crappy (you can't see where to jump, what is directly in front of you or above you).I don't remember physics puzzles being so freaking broken. I literally spent 10 minutes placing 2 stones on a pressure plate.Gunfight mechanic is one of the worst. I had much easier time hitting enemies in old voodoo-powered intel 486 computer.Visually this game is good though, no major gamebreaking bugs. But you might sometime glitch through a wall and have to restart from a save.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Since buying this again, I have to say, I am amazed on how well the game is optimised and how fun it is for a 2008 game. I am approaching the ending of the game, and I never want it to stop :(. I am definitely going to play the previous tomb raiders as my enjoyment when playing underworld was ""out of this world"" XD In conclusion, I rate this game 9/10 for it's brilliant story and well driven gameplay.

												It was without competition the worst gaming experience of my life. It literally felt like the team had done a brainstorm on how to create the most difficult user interface (UI) in the world, combined with the least generic game design the age has seen. The amount of frustration was so vast that I actually gave up at one point. Since most of the problems fall under couple of categories, it's very clear to see which developer team didn't do their job. On top it's a game about perfecting stupid keyboard commands, how fun is that?-------CONS-------Gameplay- It feels like an extremely poor adaption from console to PC. A true keyboard player's nightmare.- The climbing puzzles were challenging not because of difficulty but because of weirdly acting controls. I found myself doing the same puzzles over and over again just because the controls acted in a certain way one time and did something else the other time when i was in the very same situation.- Swinging on a rope is amazingly hard, sometimes it seems to work, other times not.- I spent 15% of time solving the puzzles and 85% to complete them due to broken controls.- Every jump in the game is an unforseen mystery how the controls are gonna react. I was half way through the game and still hadn't figured it out. - Overall controlling Lara doesnt feel smooth and natural.User interface- Gamesave process is confusing and time consuming. Manual saving is possible but useless because the game always loads from some place of itself not where you saved it.- Bad optimization: loading a savegame can take up as much time as loading from scratch.- Only some of the controls have defined key combinations in the options menu. For example it doesn't tell you how to throw an object or how to lower yourself on ropes.Game design- Worst example of inconsistent game rules. Time and again you could climb one type of crates but not others, leaving you baffled. Sometimes there would be ledges that seem so obvious a person could hold onto, yet Lara can't handle them. It just feels like the developer didn't hire a game designer.- Solutions to puzzles can come as out of the box. - The picking up of items/ breaking loot vases is time-consuming. Further more: I couldn't care less about the collectibles because they didn't seem to add anything to the game.- Lara can't interact with objects that scream to have this option. For example Lara is unable to open doors IN HER OWN HOUSE.Visual- Reversed design logic: the objects that are closest to you (Lara, motorcycle) have the simplest textures whereas the background environment is detailed and realistic.- 3d character models reflect a lack of anatomic knowledge.Bugs- Objects that allow interaction fly away when placed on the ground.--------------PROS--------------+ A peaceful soundscape that works great.+ The climbing puzzles are exciting when overlooking problems with controls.+ Background environments look rich and beautiful.+ Multi-aiming/ multi-shooting when more than one enemy is in range is original and smart.

												If I had to describe this game with one word, it would be the word 'annoying'.I was so curious about the ending, but i don't have any patience left to complete the game.It's full of bugs, if you fall down after a long and annoying climb, (because Lara decides not to grab a ledge) you have to start it all over again. Like ALL OVER again. No safe ledges, no auto-save at vital points. The combat is boring (and annoying too, of course) there are these little enemies, like spiders and bats, that are a complete waste of time. Since Lara aims automatically, you just have to click, until they are gone. No aiming no point at all. On the other hand there are big enemies, that can take five to ten shotgun shots and you can't dodge their attacks,( there is a dodge button, but just like those little enemies, it is pointless) so the best is if you kick them to their deaths. That's the fastest way. The sad thing about it is that there is no end of these struggles. It's like the developers didn't care at all.There was this damn fine game called: Legend. Combat was fun, platforming was fun, it was a game you wanted to complete 100% and then play it again.Underworld is not that kind of game. I love the Tomb Raider series but it's a shame that this one is amongst them.Play Tomb Raider, play Tomb Raider: Legend, play Anniversary, but never play Underworld.Unless you want to have a nearvous breakdown.

												really, they've tested the controls of the game. You stuck literally everywhere. Pressing any direction key isnt working as expected in most situation where obstacles are near your charakter. Sometimes Lara just behaves as she is falling while standing on flat ground. Jumping onto legdes aint easy as well because most of the time Lara tries to wall-jump. Which is some sort of useless feature anyway.Especially the third person camera is really buggy and flipping around as there is a thunderstorm. In most situations it is impossible to take a look in that direction where you want to, which is nagging while climbing and trying to find the next possible spot.And in my point of view its kind of too much searching around, where you have to ascend/descend. It is occuping something like 98% of the whole game time.Edit:After completing first playtrough and played half of second one in highest difficulty I can only repeat my disregards for that game. The controls are even getting worse over time. It is impossible to get used to them. The producers where talking about something like ""freedom to do whatever you want to"". WTF, biggest lie ever. I cant do a sh... I cant go the ways I want to, Lara cant do the things she could every time... because the programmes want me to go ONLY ONE SINGLE WAY. They do not allow anything else, even if it seems plausible.But the camera is definitly the biggest pain in the a.. At no point in the game, you can look in that direction where you actually want to. So most of the time it is somehow playing blinded.And I have payed 9 bucks for that crap, that every first semester student of information science can do better...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game looks great, Lara looks gorgeous, and… that's about as much as i can say about the game, because i can't play any more of it. Why? The camera makes me sea-sick. That's saying a lot, because no game has ever made me as dizzy as this one, and i've been playing computer games for over 25 years.So what is it about the camera? In short, it has a life of its own. As soon as you hit any of the movement keys, the camera tries to level itself out and point towards where Lara is headed. The only way to stop this behaviour is to stop moving, But walking and looking around at the same time is nigh impossible, as you're constantly struggling against the camera. It gets worse the closer you move around walls, inside tight corridors, or close to ledges, as the camera likes to suddenly flip or spin around, resulting in you running into said wall – or off a cliff. The game was obviously designed to be played with a controller, where this ""camera helper"" might have been a good idea, but when you're used to playing with keyboard/mouse, it becomes unbearable.

												Mixed reveiw here. Gorgeous character, level design, and story. But slightly poor execution of the game. Handfull of bugs towards the end. I found myself dying more from falling b/c the game didn't recognize that I was facing a ledge completely and the jump looked plausible to make, but I fell to my death at the last moment because the camera kept shifting or because I kept getting randomly hit by Natla's fireballs. Solution to this problem would problably have to use a controller instead of a mouse to get the camera angles, straight. And another solution would have been to make being able to stun Natla from hitting you. The tutorials in game explain fairly wel how to run,jump, swim, climb, and shoot etc but the Head-shot mechanic could have been better implemented. It took me a bit to get used to looking at where my heatlh meter was as opposed to where my adrenaline meter was and I had to use Youtube to figure out how to properly use the mechanic The game's in-promptu moment weren't entirely clear to me when you could use it during the heat of battle.  But thanks to helpfull  gamers out there once I practiced it was a flawless tactic to use.My last and particular thing though, that I will say about Underworld which gripes me beyond the simple glitches is the so called DLC that was released after the launch. Apparently after the game there's two continuing, chapters explaining more if not totally concluding the game in it's own right.After a little reasearch, apparently Crystal Dynamics had intensions of including the chapters but due to a small layoff of the deves, caused it to be DLC since Microsoft wasn't sure if the sales would cap. I've yet to find if there's a Steam port of these chapters. The ending by itself feels rushed and watered down compared to the other Tomb Raider's. There's no real explanation as to what happens to Lara, Amanda, Natla, and Croft manor when you escape Avalon. Not to mention there's no real showdown you get to have with ol' Natla who's impervious to any attack. That being said, it's a shame there wasn't better communication with the development and marking team during the release of this Tomb Raider cause it's got some really nice features that just could've been improved over time.Overall 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tomb Raider Underworld could turn out as one of the best TR games but sadly it doesnt :/The levels are really well designed the story is awesome as it follows Legend and anniversary story line and ends it. but why am i saying it is not a good game compared to others?All boss fights are cutscenes you do not need to put %1 effort for killing any of those bosses in fact this game doesn't have any bosses while it could have atleast 10, Amanda + Natla + Huge squid + Lara Clone + The tough marine guy at first level and so on all of these could be a nice boss fight at the end of each level but sadly you just have to walk to them and a cutscene appears and you just sit back and watch the fight then it is over without %1 effort.There are some good things about this game like the targeting system with dual weapons that you can shoot two targets at the same time, Lara has some new moves and climbing methods and she can even do some karate moves, there are many enemies in each level which stops the game from being boring like Anniversary, the other good thing is the ending is some like legend where you take Thor's Hammer ( Arthur's sword in legend) and it exactly acts like the sword in legend. You can change your gear any time at the current level (i personally do not like this sort of games).I really dunno if i should recommend this game or not, for one time try it worths it and it feels like a good story if you have the background from Legend and Anniversary but between these 3 games this is my reconnmendation: 1st Legend 2nd Underworld and 3rd Anniversary in fact i do not recommend anniversary at all because it is just way too boring and dull. in fact if they had combined anniversary and underworld together they could make the best tomb raider which was continueing Legend story and ending it.%50 recommending it and %50 not recommending it is a bit hard to decide about this game for me			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you like tons of unnecessary deaths caused by incredibly unresponsive controls and environments that look exactly like ledges you can climb on?  Well go no further, you've found your game.  Terrible ""combat"" system, uninteresting characters, short gameplay length, forgetful scenes, and puzzles so easy my 11 month old daughter pointed out the solutions.  The story was pretty interesting, some of the locations were neat...  All in all if done correctly could make a pretty interesting movie, especially if the actress playing Lara wore the lingirie as the character.  There are much better TR games, but this one being free at the time led for a fairly interesting waste of a few hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If they wanted to give the Tomb Raider series a very forgettable ending, they did it quite well. Everything about this game looks rushed, from the unresponsive and buggy controls to the story, which makes no sense and leaves you with an awful anti-climax. All the content that used to be a constant feature in the series is also gone: Croft Mansion? Nope. Boss battles? Nope. Unlockable costumes? Nope, nope. All that remains is a pretty average platformer that ends in a handful of hours (took 14 hrs to me to find all the - useless - treasures, but just because I died plenty of times due to the bad controls) and has zero replayability or extras. At this point I can see why they decided to reboot the series and focus on a new retelling of Lara's origins.I suggest to play this only if you are curious to see how they closed the trilogy started with Legend, but if you just want to play a nice Tomb Raider game with HD graphics stick to Anniversary. That game was a gem and its quality is incomparable with this half-baked thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The control is horrible and sometimes the camera angle is just horrible too with a lot of glitch. The puzzles and fights are too easy, and most of the fights are so unnecessary. There are no boss fights, only cutscenes. BUT! It is a Tomb Raider, Lara is sexy as usual, the scenes are beautiful and you get the usual atmosphere with really nice music. I recommend it to every Tomb Raider fan, but if you don't like frustrating games then skip it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mixed reveiw here. Gorgeous character, level design, and story. But slightly poor execution of the game. Handfull of bugs towards the end. I found myself dying more from falling b/c the game didn't recognize that I was facing a ledge completely and the jump looked plausible to make, but I fell to my death at the last moment because the camera kept shifting or because I kept getting randomly hit by Natla's fireballs. Solution to this problem would problably have to use a controller instead of a mouse to get the camera angles, straight. And another solution would have been to make being able to stun Natla from hitting you. The tutorials in game explain fairly wel how to run,jump, swim, climb, and shoot etc but the Head-shot mechanic could have been better implemented. It took me a bit to get used to looking at where my heatlh meter was as opposed to where my adrenaline meter was and I had to use Youtube to figure out how to properly use the mechanic The game's in-promptu moment weren't entirely clear to me when you could use it during the heat of battle.  But thanks to helpfull  gamers out there once I practiced it was a flawless tactic to use.My last and particular thing though, that I will say about Underworld which gripes me beyond the simple glitches is the so called DLC that was released after the launch. Apparently after the game there's two continuing, chapters explaining more if not totally concluding the game in it's own right.After a little reasearch, apparently Crystal Dynamics had intensions of including the chapters but due to a small layoff of the deves, caused it to be DLC since Microsoft wasn't sure if the sales would cap. I've yet to find if there's a Steam port of these chapters. The ending by itself feels rushed and watered down compared to the other Tomb Raider's. There's no real explanation as to what happens to Lara, Amanda, Natla, and Croft manor when you escape Avalon. Not to mention there's no real showdown you get to have with ol' Natla who's impervious to any attack. That being said, it's a shame there wasn't better communication with the development and marking team during the release of this Tomb Raider cause it's got some really nice features that just could've been improved over time.Overall 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tomb Raider Underworld could turn out as one of the best TR games but sadly it doesnt :/The levels are really well designed the story is awesome as it follows Legend and anniversary story line and ends it. but why am i saying it is not a good game compared to others?All boss fights are cutscenes you do not need to put %1 effort for killing any of those bosses in fact this game doesn't have any bosses while it could have atleast 10, Amanda + Natla + Huge squid + Lara Clone + The tough marine guy at first level and so on all of these could be a nice boss fight at the end of each level but sadly you just have to walk to them and a cutscene appears and you just sit back and watch the fight then it is over without %1 effort.There are some good things about this game like the targeting system with dual weapons that you can shoot two targets at the same time, Lara has some new moves and climbing methods and she can even do some karate moves, there are many enemies in each level which stops the game from being boring like Anniversary, the other good thing is the ending is some like legend where you take Thor's Hammer ( Arthur's sword in legend) and it exactly acts like the sword in legend. You can change your gear any time at the current level (i personally do not like this sort of games).I really dunno if i should recommend this game or not, for one time try it worths it and it feels like a good story if you have the background from Legend and Anniversary but between these 3 games this is my reconnmendation: 1st Legend 2nd Underworld and 3rd Anniversary in fact i do not recommend anniversary at all because it is just way too boring and dull. in fact if they had combined anniversary and underworld together they could make the best tomb raider which was continueing Legend story and ending it.%50 recommending it and %50 not recommending it is a bit hard to decide about this game for me			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												just finished it, after 12 hour with a little goofing arround on the motorbike and several death (caused by me, human error and some little bugs).i like it, the start is a bit boring, but the varying level design keept me going.the sounds and the music are nice, the riddles sometimes very tricky and time consuming-you get what you pay for, a real tomb raider game.the story is okay for this genre, the graphics sweet for a 2008 production.the animations are mostly realistic, exept when you die, then  lara becomes a bouncy ball.negative is that the steam in game overlay doesnt work for any reason, so you wont be able to take any screenshots, nor can you use the steam friends application. all together its still worth your money.

												Even after 8 years it's the great game. It was my first in Tomb Raider franchise cause older one's graphics is already too ugly for me and although I thought that Tomb Raider gameplay is not right match for me I was blown away. Great puzzles, great graphics and atmosphere, great kinetics a feeling that I'm really hanging 100m high at some ancient structure - simply great.But there are some things that are not so great. Sometimes camera is very confusing and behaving strangely but much more annoying are controls with combination with camera sometimes as your desired movement direction must be relative to camera angle and that sometimes create very annoying situations where you die not from your lack of skill but simply because of controls and confusing camera angle. But this problem is not present all the time, most of the time controls are pretty intuitive.And one technical note - although Big Picture was telling me that this game needs keyboard and mouse and is not suitable for gamepad, it was completely gamepad ready and I had not any problem at all (XBox One Wireless controller connected to PC)+ gameplay+ puzzles+ level design+ movement feeling+ graphics and art (underwater is great !)+ atmosphere- sometimes confusing camera- sometimes frustrating controls			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing the 2 prequels to this game I was expecting something very big for the end of the rebooted trilogy.The first game, TR Legend, was a masterpiece. I have not played the older versions and this was the first TR I played and was truly amazed how good and unique it was for such an old game.The second, TR Anniversary, was even better in every way! The managed to up themeselve on every aspect.But this game is such a disappointement I had to delete it and search for the story only to watch, because I was not able to fix any of the issues I had with it.Not only does it not feel like a Tomb Raider it doesnt look like it either. And gameplay?Camera angles/stuttering gave me a headache. Controls are not responsive. I had 3 unexplained crashes. I have to run the game on lowest settings to minimize problems.My specs are:- AMD FX8350- Radeon HD7950 3GB-16GB ramWell I've never made a video before, but after what I experience I had to.


Tomb Raider Underworld Box physics 
A Video of Tomb Raider: Underworld
By: Nifaro

			This is one of the big examples of the many things wrong in this PC version of the game in steam. The game originally came out in 2008 and was the 3rd and last in the rebooted series - Legend, Anniversary, Underworld.

I have a decent new PC that can run most games with 144 fps at medium to high settings, but this game even tho it is 8 years older than my PC just dies. Itll run fine for like 30 minutes then randomly cuts to 15 fps. It's a real shame cause its a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not a bad game, but they keep trying to add new stuff that doesn't work. After finishing TR : Legend ( a somewhat smooth but short experience ) I wanted to give this one another try. Could never finish it because most of the time I end up ragequiting, and here is why :- the controls sucks sometimes and Lara dies- the balancing mechanics on wooden beams sucks and Lara dies- the wall multi-jump mechanics doesn't work and you have to start over, or Lara dies- the headshot system sucks and is completely useless- you have to fight the camera constantly, and Lara dies- Ai is mindless or berserk- the save system sucksIn fact this game could have been called Tomb Raider : Lara dies a lot. I died more time in the 2 first levels than in the entire Legend game, only due to bad controls, camera, or design. Maybe it's a good thing that they rebooted the series with the 2013 TR, because the next ""normal"" TR game would have been a real mess full of useless gameplay mechanics just for the sake of adding something new, even if it doesn't work.At least Lara looks good, when she doesn't die. Only play it if you can overcome the bad gamedesign.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion this game feels as if the developers were under pressure to release the game, resulting in a game that feel very unfinished. The controls are messy, lara is often all over the place or she doesnt go where you'd want here to go, some controls like the ""throw"" action arent even listed in the keybindings, resulting in utter frustration when you have to solve the cube puzzle with pressure plates right before the relic room, I had to look it up on the internet, and quickly discovered that the thow button was on the Capslock key by default, and could not be changed, who even puts controles on the capslock key right?? The camera is often all over the place aswell, and then you havent got me started on the AI yet. This is by far one of the dumbest AI's I've ever encountered in a game. I'm not even joking when I say that the AI from the enemies in Tomb Raider 1 is far better than the AI from Underworld. One of the best examples of this is when you are on the enemy ship, the guards often face their backs to you, dont see you or stand there twitching stupidly when they get shoot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is an area where your post to use the cubs to weigh down the pressure plate. But the cubs randomly fly off the screen anytime you pick them up and set them down. i have ran this game on Windows 7 and Windows 8, and it seems to be the same issue. There is a major PC bug.

												Highly do not recommend. Game play is horrible. Puzzles are the normal for Tomb Raider-but cannot be completed due to bad game play. I am stuck placing blocks to hold down weights on fllor, every time I place a weight, it flies away from where I put it. It literally flies off the ground, across the room, and settles where-ever it wants. Throwing the blocks is no help either. It is almost like there is a force feild around the weights on the floor that prevent placing the weights on it to help open the doors to continue the story.Climbing and jumping from/to objects is not good either- the camera likes to shift mid/pre jump and for some reason you follow the path of the camera. I have literally jumped in a circle as the camera angle shifts. I thought maybe my computer is the issue, so I tried it on my laptop- same issues.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Are you ready to be frustrated and aggravated? Are you ready to repeat the same moves over and over? If not, skip this one over.The camera is ridiculous and sometimes Lara goes in the complete opposite direction of where you direct her to go. Other times you will be jumping blindly forward or backward hoping that it's the correct direction because you can't spin the camera around. Oh! And prepare to have Lara spaz out and get stuck in numerous areas while you flail about on the controller trying to get her unstuck. The game itself is beautiful and the story is nice, but the camera/controls make it almost unplayable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a poor port of the game, full of bugs and poor performance compared to Tomb Raider 2013. Funny fact, as an archeologist and adventurer, this version of Lara seem to have no respect for old relicsm she's usually kicking the urns like it's a rugby ball.While i've enjoyed TR I, II, III, Anniversary and TR 2013, underworld made me delete the game after 48 minutes of gameplay due bugs.

Posted: April 6, 2015
												To be honest, the game disappointed me.For a product present on the market for so long, and one which is supposedly on its last patch, TR:U is uncomfortably buggy: stuck points, position estimation errors, weird physics at times, control problems and annoying camera behavior - you name it, it's there. You wouldn't believe how many deaths I experienced just because the camera refused to cooperate or Lara did not grab a 100% sure ledge for some reason. I don't understand how did they manage to screw it up when they had the near perfection of TR: Anniversary as a template.Another thing is the plot. I know this is not the most imortant aspect of an adventure game, but holy smoke is the story in Underworld uninspiring. I especially love it how Lara is emotionally disconnected from her long-time co-workers and supposedly friends. An outstanding display of long-lasting bonds, built upon trust, hardships, ups and downs and life-threatening situations endured together throughout the years of working together... Not really.Last but not least, what's the point of the artifacts and relics in this game? When the former is completely useless and you basically trip over one or another every other step, the latter offers you only the ""advantage"" of expanding your health bar - not that this boost will ever make a difference in combat and sure as hell won't save you when falling off a ledge. Also, you cannot even view the collected stuff in your manor. One of the amazing feats of the previous games was that you could always come back to the manor and look at the unique tokens brought back from your adventures - it was like an internal achievement system and really satisfying. And here you are to enjoy collecting generic cubes and orbs. Fun.The game is visually beautiful and most of the locations are quite interesting - I'll give the game that. However, the fact that the gameplay tends to be quite uncooperative because of the reasons listed above, I couldn't really enjoy it that much. More frustration than fun, really.To sum up, the game seems very rushed to me and sadly is a wasted potential. They wanted to close the story weaved through Legend and Anniversary and did so but without the effort they should have put in the title. This is one game I will definitely not come back to.If you're thinking of going for this game, do yourself a favour and (re-)play Tomb Raider Anniversary instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(They are not even puzzles)-Silly enemies and animals. (They all act like stupid robots)-Total waste of money. My gameplay time extends 13 hours. I might say the definite 4 hours of it is to control Lara. Thumbs down for gameplay mechanics.Conclusion: Does not worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simple puzzles, average platforming, and pathetically easy combat hold back what could have been a great Tomb Raider game. Everything felt rushed, from the lack of boss fights to the short levels. There are good ideas buried in this unfinished mess, but nothing in this game is rewarding. It feels like it really wants to reward you for your time, but it doesn't know how to, apart from showing you Lara's♥♥♥♥♥throughout the entire game.So, with a very weak ending to an already weak game (albeit with lots of potential), I cannot see me recommending this game. If this is really all they could do with the formula after all these years, then maybe it was best to reboot the Tomb Raider series after all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some people would say that this game was the reason that Tomb Raider got rebooted a second time.I'm inclined to agree with them.In previous installments, Lara was alone, pitting her wits and her skills against the unforgiving wild. Now she has radio chatter from a bunch of jibbering male sidekicks that have such invaluable skills as being able to read and use the internet to gather information for her.Still, the game is playable on Steam, as opposed to most TR titles that came before 6. Until you have to ""control"" a vehicle anyway.7/10 - It's mostly the throwaway side characters and the ♥♥♥♥ing forklift level that drag this score down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terrible camera ruins otherwise okay game.It autocenters when it shouldn't.It doesn't autocenter when it should.Sometimes it's completely blocked by terrain.The only way to swim without drifting up is to constantly reposition your view down.Most of the time the player model takes up 80+% of the screen, which makes any sort of combat a complete mess.There are tons of climbing spots that completely lock the camera to a single field of view.And to top it off, movement controls are relative to the camera's position. One moment, left could be left, then the camera randomly shifts and makes left right.The camera is so bad that you'll eventually find a few spots in the game where you can press forward and get stuck in a movement loop.

												Linear gameplay, bad looking combat, and tedious puzzles make this game boring above all else.Y'know when you go to the doctor's office, and it takes hours for you to get to the actual appointment? And after a while you just want the end of the wait to be over so you can see the doctor, and say you got your appointment?That's what Tomb Raider: Underworld is like.I recommend Tomb Raider: Anniversary instead (if you haven't already bought it.)

												I really struggled with feeling motion sickness playing this game.  I couldn't get past the first couple of levels due to the feeling.  I think it has something to do with the laggy camera.  I was really disappointed as I really enjoyed playing anniversary edition.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It IS possible to like this game, or more than like it, but I just cannot. If you like FPS games where that character you play jumps, stops, shoots, ducks, etc. when you want them to..............well, this game doesn't do that, nor do any of the past few tomb raiders for that matter. If you just like the ""feel"" of it and the environment, and are not dismayed by the mindless endless repeating of things because your quirky control of Lara committed suicide by walking off a high area, then maybe there's hope for you. For me, that's not my definition of fun nor entertainment, I can tell when I start wanting to cause physical harm to my monitor due to sheer frustration. In other words, things do not happen as fluidly as they should. Right now I'm looking at it and the price is $2.24, I got it part of some other package. If it were free I still wouldn't like it, but that's me. Although this game being a platformer may be debateable, what is required to progress in it is not. You have to jump at an exact moment, at an exact time, heading an exact way, at an exact height....yeah, no thanks. Al that does is guarantee multiple repetition of the same sequense. In my book that equals boring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this one because I like Tomb raider 2013 version and wanna try the previous generation but this game made me headache everytime i played and have to stop playingI guess this kind of camera view is not good with me.I used to play new one already so this one has less option, weapons and action to do compare to 2013 versionIf you don't have motion sickness like me and want to try other version of tomb raider maybe its ok to buyFor me, i'm quite regret cause i cant enjoy the game much when I have to play game and get headacheso i just try to finish the story without finding the collections then bye bye this game ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What the hell is wrong ?At about 30 min of game play, you may have found that movement and camera can be wonky.But the physics and optimization of this game is juste horrible.At some point, you get a massive FPS drop (like from 200 to 12), and once you get out of this area, you have two small cubes to move around, but for a ♥♥♥♥ing unknow reason, they just decide to fly away or bounce like a bouncing ball when you put them. Of course, the cube get stuck in an area where you can't get the cube out of it.There are more bugs in 30 min of gameplay in Underworld than in 20+ hours of Anniversary2/20, DO NOT BUY			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tried to play this for nostalgia.. But ♥♥♥♥ no.Game grinds to a halt all of a sudden. Controls are clunky as ♥♥♥♥. All of a sudden you drop something and it warp speeds to the opposite side of the map. This is definitely one of those games that gets worse with age. I think I'd rather buy a PS1 for 4$ then bother with this franchise again. >_>			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Glitches and bad controls make it extremely unpleasant to play.The jumps are too short, they feel weird and artifically shortened. By comparison jumping off a ledge you can jump much farther than with a running jump. What?The dodge mechanic is unweildy and hard to manage. The last thing I want to be doing when trying to dodge something is finicking around with having to press 3 buttons at once to make it happen.I gave up when in one of the early puzzles you had to weight down some switches with boxes (I assume, I didn't complete it) and my boxes both went flying off into space as soon as I put them down. Not just a freak glitch, it happened every time until I realized you have to wait for the (fully pressed down) switch to stop making noise before you could set them down or they would rocket off like they had a mission for the moon. I was unable to find one of them again I assume it landed in the water behind me and there was no way to get it back, at which point I quit the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Наверно, единственная игра из серии, которую я купила сразу после выхода (2008 год). Тогда мне нравилось все.Разнообразные локации и скандинавская мифология.Графика.Взрослые реальные (приближенные к живым людям) персонажи, хотя и не все: Натла и Блондинка (забыла как зовут х)) все таки не очень хорошо проработаны.Анимация, боевые движения (тогда вроде захват движения был использован первый раз?)В общем, было видно, что постарались )Но все равно оставался, какой-то неприятный осадок.И только сейчас я понимаю почему: игра слишком перенасыщена всем этим, что я перечислила выше 😂 Ну, правда, авторы хотели всем угодить, а в итоге перестарались. В частности смущает несуразная история. PS Я сегодня слишком жестокая.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By far the most annoying game that i have played in a while. The controls are just a pain and the camera is not much better. At some places you just can't get the right move to get to another point. The result is you have to go up the same long way again and again until you figured out how to do the jump. Its a riddle how this game could get 80%. Maybe just because its Lara Croft -.-			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Maybe one day I will play more of this and just trudge on through the crap beginning they crafted, but I'd rather just play the new one or the top down one they made, Again I am only judging the beginning of this game here and NOTHING else so keep that in mind. I am also still reccomending the game simply because someone should enjoy it, especailly die hard fans. Just not me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first Tomb Raider game for seventh generation consoles, artists finally had enough processing power to push the limits of computer graphics and render pants on Lara Croft.Inferior to Tomb Raider Anniversary in almost every way. Motion capture was used for Lara's animations, so there's no smooth tweening between actions; it feels really stiff. The art style skewed realistic at the expense of gameplay. There are lots of ridges visible all over objects, but only some of them are grabbable. Level design has gone downhill; things are poorly signposted, and I spent a lot of time in certain places wandering around trying to find the next area.Then there are the glitches. Lara won't consistently grab irregular ledges for some reason. The final level has lots of moving platforms that Lara ""homes in on"" when you jump towards them, except when she doesn't. There's a Sands of Time type mechanic when fighting undead where you have to deal the final blow after they've fallen, but half the time Lara just does a spin kick instead.The graphics are a lot prettier than previous games, and there are no boss fights. Other than that? Just go play Anniversary.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is a hard decision to recommend this game or not.  THE GAME ITSELF IS FINE.  I have played this game before and love it.  I recently bought it on Steam for my new laptop (which, apparently has no CD/DVD Drive.  Must be a new feature of laptops.  Ironic(?) because it is a GAMING laptop.).  At any rate, My laptop is great.NVDIA GEFORCE GTX 970m, i7 core, 12GB ram, etc.This game runs the new Tomb Raiders just fine all maxed out.  It runs older games (Metro, Anniversary, etc) maxed out, no problem.  Hell, it even runs Call of Cthulhu Dark Corners (With a bit of fidgeting because it's Win10) just fine.  But this game gets choppy in places, glitches out when I pick up objects (I spent 30min trying to place the two stupid small boxes on the pressure pad but the game would set them down and then throw them off.)  I have NEVER had this many issues with this game before.  I had the DVD version which ran smoothly on an older computer.  So I assume that it has something to do with the STEAM version.  I've read other players having the same issues with the steam version too, so I assume it isn't just me.  Overall, if you want to play this, find it on another download client or buy the disc.  This version seems to be really bugged.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to say that I don't recommend this game. The mechanics need more polish. One example is one jump might appear close enough, but since you're not supposed to go there, you'll fall and die. You will successfully leap across a larger gap if you are meant to go that route. This kind of trial an error sucks. There is a major physics glitch that nearly prevents you from completing the game. (Vsync helps.) You will be manually adjusting the camera almost constantly to undo the angles it automatically chooses. Combat is really an annoying part of the game.What was good? The puzzles and climbing parts were fun. Unfortunately, everything else that surrounds the core gameplay to make it a more fleshed out game ends up detracting from the enjoyment of the game.
