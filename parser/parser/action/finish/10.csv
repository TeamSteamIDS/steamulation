												This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008.  So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.			",292,37,2,24,19,1,18

												Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP.And too all the people who will keep playing this game, all I can say, as always,  GL & HF <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the bestgame to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.It starts off with a team trying to kill another team. I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).			",21,1,0,0,0,0,0

Review 21/10/2014:I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles. 1337/10Leet crew 5 lyfKicks csgo's♥♥♥♥♥by a mile. I forgot how good wallbanging is in this game.P.S - CS 1.6 is the only Counter Strike game where you can headshot with a knife or buy Riot Shields. Enjoy!Oh yeah, you don't have to pay to use sprays in this game either.			",199,22,3,13,16,3,20

												First of all its my first online game ever. I was very young and i was playing with my friends LAN matches sometimes for fun sometimes with bets the loser treats refreshments. xD This game its the reason that i maked my mum to buy me a PC to playing this game at my home. With the time i learn how to modding on CS 1.6 servers,plugins and more stuffs about PC. After this i learn how to aim on the enemy head, how to fire inside the walls, how to hear someone with his steps and HOW TO FIGHT!!! I have played many FPS(First Person Shooter) Games that they called me hacker of my fast killing.I had so fyckin good and bad moments on that game that i will not forget never.For others its only a game for me it was MY LIFE!

After 14 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayers in the world.While earning tons of money based on Counter-Strike sales, Valve shows its appreciation to the players that bought the game by still not maintaining it and treating it like it doesn't even exist. Even more, starting with February 2013, Valve has released a couple of minor updates for Counter-Strike which intentionally created problems for the game(suddenly stopping afterwards) so that the players would be forced to migrate to and buy CS:GO(which currently has and most probably will keep having major problems like fps drops and hit misdetection - problem present on all Source engine based multiplayers since 2004). Congratulations, Valve.Counting the players that migrated to or play the non-Steam version of Counter-Strike, the game still easily classifies itself even today in the top 5 most played multiplayers in the world.

												I only write this because of how nostalgic I feel. The game that gave me my passion for shooters. Hands down, in my opinion, best game made in history. This game, I cannot explain how many emotions it gave me, and thousands or millions of other players. Cs 1.6, please stay alive. Pros- EverythingCons- Nothing			",43,17,4,5,5,0,3

												""Lock and Load.""""Go go go!""""Fire in the hole!""""The bomb has been planted.""""Counter-terrorists/terrorists Win.""It is uncountable just how many times have these few sentences echoed in cybercafés across the world. For many, days were spent in front of the computer screen, manipulating the WASD keys with left hand and whirling the mouse with the right one. People yell and frown, they cheer and jeer as they team up their cyber-persona and pit them against another team. It doesn’t matter who won, who lost, who managed to kill to most of their opponents and who died the most, as everything will be scrambled up and reset when a new match begins. What is important is that, for those who are a part of the team, this computer game is their reality. These personas within the computer screen are their true identities. This is counter-strike. Originally a modification (mod in short) made for Valve’s critically acclaimed Half-Life, Counter-Strike has gained much prominence since its initial launch. It is one of the first and definitely one of the most critically acclaimed multi-player computer games of all times. It is also the game used for many professional electronic sports competitions, such as ESEA League. Of course, this does not put Counter-Strike as a “professional only” game, as it has been enjoyed by many since its launch.Getting started with Counter-strike is simple. You start off in one of the two teams: Counter-Terrorists or Terrorists. Before the round begins, you will have to purchase your own gun from the market, namely the famous AK47, M4A1, Desert Eagle, MP5, AWP and many more. Do not ask me why the counter-terrorists (namely the police) have to buy their own gun, and that they will have to go out with their lousy default colt pistols. Perhaps the government had some budget cuts and the SWATs have to buy their own guns. No one knows, but at least this will balance up the game. Also, you can equipment such as Highly-Explosive grenades, Flash-bangs (not recommend for beginners), smoke grenades, helmets and kevlars. You can also grab a defuse kit if you are playing on the side of the counter-terrorist, but normally we will steal that from dead teammates. Oh and you will be given a knife for free. Don’t worry about it, as most likely you use it to run instead of anything else.The gameplay is fairly straightforward as well. There are quite a few number of game mods. The most frequently played ones are the Bomb Defusal maps, such as the all-time famous de_dust, the Hostage Rescue maps such as cs_assault, the VIP Escorting maps and the Kill Them All maps, such as the custom fy_iceworld and awp_map. Like all multi-player First Person Shooters, you will need good coordination and communication with your teammates if you want to win. Don’t worry about it though, because if you are new, just stick around and listen to what others have got to say. Just remember, you are not John Rambo, you only have 100 HP, and a stray bullet from a sniper rifle (AWP) will deal more damage than that.As time press on, the mechanism of Counter-Strike became outdate. Of course, the legacy of Counter-Strike continues through its successors such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike Online (Asia only) and, the newest of all, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Throughout the years, Counter-Strike has evolved to become what it is today while its legend remains. Together with Half-Life and (maybe) Team Fortress Classic, Counter-Strike has not only helped Valve to thrive as a gaming company, but also defined what First Person Shooter should be.

												Counter-Strike is a great series. Though the real change they made was in CS:GO, Counter-Strike has been one of my favorite FPS games of all time. If you prefer a fast based shooter, this game isn't for you.Counter-Strike can have exciting moments where it's you VS 5 others, or where you have no defuse kit with only a few seconds left to defuse the bombA comparable version of Counter-Strike's defuse gametype is the Call Of Duty ""Search and Destroy""			",205,23,3,14,18,4,29

												So here's a little story.Before my dad and my mom got a divorce, and before I was even born, my mom would work late nights at the the hosipital (she was a nurse), leaving my dad home alone. He wouldn't really have anything to do so one day, he went to the store and bought Counter-Strike (it was back then when you needed a disc to play; steam wasn't around yet). and he would play until she got home. 14 years later on Saturday, April 15th 2017, he personally bought me and my little brother copies of Counter-Strike so we can all play together. This game brought my family closer together ever since the divorce.10/10, best game ever. ",39,3,0,7,4,0,1

Counter-Strike 1.6Counter-Strike 1.6 is the newest Point-and-Click Adventure from the makers of the hit game Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies. Don't be mistaken by the rather plain name, though, as this is not simply another uninspired reboot of that beloved Uninstallation Simulation game; no, Counter-Strike 1.6 is the real deal! The mechanics and gameplay are top-notch. You can jump like you're in the Matrix, run almost silently by bouncing across the ground on your butt, shoot through a quarter-mile of stone or concrete, plaster X-rated images on walls to distract teammates and enemies alike, or spraypaint fake doors and ladders and watch them all run head-first into walls! There are ladders in de_dust2?? Who knew!But as hinted above, it's the physics that really make this game wonderful. Some people see a cliff-face, others see a surfin' safari. Can't figure out how your teammate jumped on that wall? Spend fifty hours failing and falling to your death, and if you're good, you just might get there too! A quick server mod will let you jump in the air, and with some practice and you can move as fast as that guy with 500 ping whose approaching footsteps sounded like a small-caliber machine gun as he shot your whole team in the face with a scout in under a second! Also, remember, kids: everyone knows you run faster with a knife. And even faster with a scout. Haven't gotten accused of speedhacking yet? What about aimbotting?""BOOM! HEADSHOT!!""With hundreds of hours of walking in circles around epically-plain sandstone ruins searching for the last cowering, brainless zombie to click on, this game will keep you bunny-hopping back for more!

												First starting off as a cute, little mod based on the GoldSrc engine, a heavily modified Quake engine, Counter-Strike's legacy continues to strife for a decade and a half over. Initially developed and released on top of a Half-Life modification, with the inspiration from the developer's strong theme and intriguement for military warfare and terrorism, the mod's success was immediately a marvel to behold; selling over 25 million units as a whole in the Counter-Strike franchise.The maps and various scenarios set around the globe, players assume the roles of soldiers on two teams, counter-terrorists and terrorists. Both with a task, depending differently on the mission. Bomb scenarios, the terrorist team must plant a bomb, in a secured bomb location, while the counter-terrorists must fight back and ultimately defuse the bomb, if it may have been planted. Hostage scenarios is where the counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages being held by the terrorists. With both these modes, it has become a traditional campaign over time in different sequels.The player, depending on what team they have been assigned to, can change their class into eight different character models, as well as buying weaponry and equipment, such as armour and grenades to help against the opposing team. As the round is about to begin, you're left in ''Freeze time'' that allows you to buy things with the money you earned by killing opponents the rounds before. This of course, gives players the time needed to choose wisely on what many strategies they will execute and whether it will be successful compared to your opponents. This game is also highly customizable on the player's end.The game gives the options allowing for the user to either install or create their own custom skins, spray graphics, sprites, sound effects and HUDS that can be used in-game. I forgot to mention that modding is possibly one the biggest things that makes Counter-Strike such a versatile game to begin with.I don't have much to complain about this game, other than it's become one of the biggest targets of hacking and cheaters, since its release. Aimbots, that auto-target other players while the player should naturally aim and shoot is just on of the many cheatings that players have executed. Wallhacks, that allows the player to see through walls through work by displaying objects that have translucent textures and can easily see targets through them, while the opposing team has no idea from their own perspective. To me, the cheating in this game is now more to do with experimenting than it is to do with cheating overall. There's a different meaning when it comes to something that is outdated and old-school. Old-school is for nostalgic value, something that will guarantee to put a smile back on your face from all these past memories you've experienced and this is what the first title of Counter-Strike engulfs. Outdated, being something you don't particularly want to go back to, while there is the famous remake, Counter-Strike: Source, that runs on the more powerful and overly-recycled Source engine, allowing for better graphic and communication capabilities. Nevertheless, if you're looking for original flare that is burning in the Counter-Strike series, this game is definitely for you.And to think, all of this success for the Counter-Strike series began as small little mod. Proof on how something so little, can create something so big. Recommended.			",111,8,0,6,5,1,3

												El mejor juego de shooter en la historia, en su tiempo, eran los mejores graficos, lanzado el 18 de junio de 1999, en sus antiguas versiones, finalmente el 1 de noviembre del 2000, se lanzó el juego que cambió la historia, Counter-Strike.El juego se fue arreglando por parte de Valve, el juego estaba rotisimo, disparar saltando, corriendo, etc.Trae demasiados modos, Zombie Escape, Surf, Deathmatch, y miles de modos más que te traerán muchas horas de juego.Lo malo que ya Counter-Strike ya no se juega en las competiciones, lo que ahora lo hace el Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, nadie se quería mudar en ese tiempo a ese juego, a nadie le gustaba, y por eso Valve, tuvo que sacar Counter-Strike de las competiciones, para obligar que los jugadores se pasaran a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.+ GRAN Cantidad de mapas (comunidad)+ Jugadores + Jugabilidad+ Adictivo y divertido.+ Multijugador.- Sistema VAC apesta.- Demasiados bugs.¿Quieres un juego donde pasaras miles de horas y baratisimo?

												This game appears to remain No. 1 FPS Action games since 2000 for around 8 to 11 years. It is a intense game as your health and your exposure is important as well sticking together with your team mates at all costs. You should maybe try this game and learn the routes in common CS maps like dust or assault. Go on try it!However they are a several downsides to this game like the weapon nerfs like the recoils and smoke grenade failing to detonate airborne and the lame Tactical Shield. And cos this game is so popular that thousands of servers host this game online, that some PC criminals tend to take advantage on players like using hacking or server addon hacking materials. So you maybe best to stay clear of weird or dodgy servers with extreme adult material and Steam cannot unban victims who got hijacked and VAC banned, so please be careful!But if you are old and wise enough to handle this intense action game...BUY IT, SOLDIER!

												Counter-Strike: Originally released as a Half-Life Modification but then became a Valve product in 2000 Then later becoming one of the Most online played game ever...Counter-Strike is a Realistic first person tactical shooter game that is based on Terrorism and Counter Terrorism. The main goal of the game is that you either have to plant the bomb at a certain bomb site ""A"" or ""B"" within the map as a Terrorist or Capture the Hostages and taking them back to your Spawn to win the round as a Counter-Terrorist. The gameplay is fun and simple but however very Competitive and requires a set of Skills.Gameplay: So there are two teams ""Terrorist"" and ""Counter-Terrorist"" each team will have one Simple task. As a Counter-Terrorist you'll usally be Rescuing the Hostages or Defusing Bombs, And you will have a Time limit each round to complete your Objectives. With the Terrorist team they'll be doing the opposite Objective than the Counter-Terrorist by Planting the bombs and trying to protect the Hostages from not being Captured. The gameplay is very fun and competitive. When winning a round, Killing an enemy, You'll be rewarded with Money and you use that Money to buy Weapons, Grenades and ammo. What i like about this game is that it's team based and in order to survive and complete the objectives is that you have to use teamwork and use tactics, It requires a lot of Skill in order to get good at the game but once you manage to get good at the game, You'll have hours of fun. From the gameplay and feel of the game it's simply just a Classic and will never be forgotten.This game is a good start if you are new to Counter-Strike and would like to buy Counter-Strike!Gameplay:9/10Graphics:7.5/10Sound:8/10Overall rating:10/10			",100,3,1,5,2,0,1

												Simply THE best shooter that you can play, to forget the anger that built up inside of you after playing too much CS:GO.It truely is a relief to play another shooter than CS:GO, without messing with your aim, movement, etc. Just set everything up the way it is in CS:GO (sensitivity, key-binds, etc.) and escape from the austerity pressure to perform well in CS:GO. And RELAX theres nothing you can do wrong here. Even when there's a cheater, just don't give a f. I mean, there isn't even a stats-record. Like there's only a serversided stats-tracking if at all. So without specifically searching for your stats on a specific server that has some kind of player-stats on it, nobody will ever know how bad you are/were :)			",294,73,11,13,24,0,27

												Counter Strike is the best shooting game, i've ever played. The 'real cs', where you plant bombs etc. is not 10/10 gaming, but look at all those great mods! The greatest thing in cs is playing mod servers, and you do not need to download them from your web, you just simply double click that server, and that's it! At first I recommend to play normal cs, if it gets boring try other servers. Oh and original maps aren't that great, except de_dust2. You must try cs even if you think it has low graphics. Gameplay is much more important than graphics, remember that!			",109,9,3,4,1,1,1

When Counter-Strike was first released it gained it's popularity immediately and become number 1 online action game, one of the most successful competitive games ever created which was easy to learn but hard to master, now Counter-Strike is dead or at least for someone because it's pro scene died in 2012, yes the pro scene is dead but the game itself is still alive, after so many years people still play and love this game, even it's pro scene lasted for unreal time, imagine it started in 2000 year and lasted for 12 years how cannot this be legendary, it's when graphics doesn't matter only gameplay.I strongly recommend to play this game at least once if you have ever played it and enjoyed, it might not be as fun as before but I still recommend, if you like original games or havent played CS at all and started from CS:S, CS:GO doesn't matter... You should really give it a try.			",49,1,0,1,1,0,0

												The best FPS game of all time hands down ! I have been playing this game from the early betas right from the begining ! (I still remember to this day, the character's legs weren't moving, it was on cs_siege) This was back in late 1999 or early 2000, now its allmost 2017 and I am still playing ! That is 17 years. This game has stood the test of time. Modern games are spurring like mushrooms with advanced graphics and whatnot, but none of them can give you the experience that this game can give you. I can sincerely say that there are a total of 2 maybe 3 games in all gaming history that can match this game's gaming experience. All in all I recommend this game to any new players who may come across it, who are looking for an amazing online multiplayer experience, and also a big shoutout for the old-school player as myself, don't stop playing this gem ! I sincerelly fear that it will take a very long time until a masterpiece of a game like this will appear, maybe even never. But who knows ? Untill then start cs 1.6 gl and hf ! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Score says it all. There's another version out called Counter-Strike: Source, but it's nothing compared to how the original Counter-Strike is. Plus, now adays it's really really cheap, like 10 dollars off of steam. As well, it has like the biggest competitive gaming community in the world, with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of tournaments and players etc... good stuff.			",137,16,7,9,8,1,13

												Quake was the first game I was ever really addicted to and focused a big portion of my time on for months or years at a time. Counter-Strike was the second - and easily more addicting. There's a reason that I still compare every multi-player shooter experience back to original Counter-Strike, to this day. There's a reason I still compare every server community to this (Counter-Strike servers each had their own community and personality and people truly got to know each other back in the day, compared to these days, where a server is just something you're automatically dumped into and feels like every other server).Despite many iterations, nothing quite plays like the original. It's not hard to see why there are still 10,000 to 60,000 people playing this at any one time on any day, fifteen years after launch and why it is always in the top ten games currently being played on all of Steam.This is where it all started. Without this, there's an entire genre of shooter and multi-player that just vanishes. The original days of Counter-Strike remain the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my entire life. It's unlikely that will ever be trumped.			",1460,602,62,239,213,17,275

												Counter-Strike was the game that changed everything for me in FPS games, coming from older games like the FPS Game Blood  back in (1997) when I was only 10 years old and Half-Life, Counter-Strike changed everything for me it was litterally the best thing ever.The quality of the game was never about the visuals for me but about the game play and performance and Counter-Strike litterally had it all in my opinion.Even today after so many years, I occasionally come back and play Counter-Strike just because it is one of the greatest Counter-Strike versions flat out, anyone disputing this are most likely people that started playing either Counter-Strike: Source or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first then tried Counter-Strike but if you played it in the right order there is no disputing this, because this game might frighten most the new generation that has expectations to visual graphics having to have a certain standard before they will even touch it.Counter-Strike is not about the visuals, that is just a bonus, if you want visuals then you probably playing the wrong game, Counter-Strike was never Battlefield nor CoD which probably to many looks visually stunning.If you want quality in a game then Counter-Strike is one of the best games to play and get, hence why I am recommending this game.

												Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.Counter-Strike is a good game. I recommend this game.Rating 8/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

Counter-Strike:I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer.Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. ",159,47,8,21,13,0,28

												Now i know what you guys are probably going to say: 'OMG this game sucks the graphics are bad D:' and like 'Pfff this game is old nobody still plays it. well it's not, its a game that's made like 13 years ago so don't expect frosbite engine graphics etc... instead you get the way more epic pixel-ish graphics and really classic sounds, and this game is still active with about 30k to 40k players each day.(That's more then all cod games together)And in my opinion it's a must have game since it's one of the best games ever and you still can install skins etc and it's price is good it's only 10 euro or dollars for this great game.

When you play it properly, with team work that clicks like a well-oiled machine, the game offers a sense of accomplishment and comradery that is simply amazing.Buy it, download it, whatever; just get on board and enjoy. Sure-fire fun for the online enthusiast.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

												Counter-Strike - a series of computer games in the genre of team first-person shooter based on the engine GoldSource, originally appeared as a modification of Half-Life games.You have to compare, so this game I will compare with СS: Source and CS: Global Offensive Pros: 1. Battle PVP.The multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential of the idea of the game.The most interesting part of this is. Under the bot can already tune in, but not in the real players. They can deceive, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes.2. The atmosphere and realism.In all games, Valve is always a great atmosphere and I was impressed.It is evident that the developers have tried to do everything in this game, as in real life.For example, the sounds. Unfortunately, Valve released a patch in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with new sounds and they made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Minuses: 1. Cheaters.Well, as without these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? These sons of dogs prevent us from playing. Creators of cheats have always been one step ahead of the creators of the VAC anti-cheat. Valve is trying to improve its anti-cheat and have it turns out.I say that Valve do nothing, not worth it.2.Graphic arts.She was good at Counter-Strike as long as did not come out Source.I'm not picky about graphics, but after 30 minutes I start to hurt your eyes.Yes, and in general, this game proved to all that the graphics in games are not the most important thing.3.Termination of support.All good things always come to an end, and Counter-Strike is not an exception. The game goes more and more players, server empty.More Valve does not release an update for Counter-Strike and does not support it in e-sports. Conclusion: Despite the fact that in this game there are downsides, even if they have, but still this game is legendary.If you ask me, as you Counter-Strike, the fond memories flooding back me, maybe I can cry .Game, which was able to give me a lot of positive emotions..

												better than cs:go:- you have spray feature (removed in cs:go)- you have flashlight & nightvision (removed in cs:go)- you have dark maps and/or dark places on a map (removed in cs:go, dark places are pretty bright, this is why there is no more flashlight & nightvision, it destroys the immersion, dark places & dark maps are useful for many aspects ingame (hiding or warcraft server when cloaked or when you want someone to knife) and reminds me of 2002 game bf1942 where dark maps are not really dark lol. VALVE shame on you)- You have character selection (removed in cs:go)- you have no ranking & market feature (added in cs:go, everyone plays cs:go because they think they end up as a rich-♥♥♥♥♥, also on every server there is trade spam in chat and even you get friendrequest spam from traders, also community is not looking at your skill anymore, but at your rank and not every server + singleplayer against bots has rank enabled.) - You have no CoD clone like CS:GOUnlike CS:GO, everyone plays this for fun, not for useless skins, money, rank etc.. also, here you cant waste 600$ for a skin. You can get even new models (which does not only change your weapon texture, but the model) from gamebanana for FREE! You can make your M4 look like the G36C etc.10/10 my fav childhood game			",66,5,1,1,5,1,3

												This game is one of best games for me. I recommend this game to all, but i recommend  buying Counter Strike: Conditon Zero and completing the game on hardest difficulty two times. Then play Counter Strike. This is one of old generation games so I wanted to buy This game is one of best games for me. I recommend this game to all, but firstly buy Counter Strike: Conditon Zero and complete game on hardest difficul two times. Then play Counter Strike. This is one of the older games so I wanted to buy it first because i wanted see what it was like before. I played that game, my older brothers played aswell . So when you play this game you have the feeling that you went  back in time and played it. Gameplay has been  perfect for years. The grapichs are  still awsome to me, I play a lot of Black Ops 3 on ps4,  this is way better than that for me. So if you have pasion and love to games first play Counter Strike , trust me you will had a lot of fun.I rate the game10/10.			",145,32,9,11,11,4,10

												Counter-Strike is a pretty old game of ""shooter"", which was developed in 1999, and since 2000, supported by Valve. This game immediately caught on millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation of terrorists and counter-terrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. Objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map, in which the battle.And here is my thoughs..This is the most entertaining video game i've ever played since 2007.I think i've played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day...I finally i bought this game and it's worth 10 bucks indeed.I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it!By that i didn't mean online or with bots but i had lots of LAN-party's in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lan-party's sometimes in my country ^^The game is still fun and it never gets boring!I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER and more and more and more...It's just fantastic! :D10/10Would recommand it!

												-Love to shoot people with real life guns with different names?-Have you ever dreamed to kill terrorists and even be a terrorist?-Love playing the same, universal map over and over just because it's the only map you'll ever know? (*cough* dust2)-Have you a desire to work as a team to complete objectives?-Do you know how to speak Brazilian-Portuguese and Romanian? (Awesome because many servers have players that have Brazilians, Romanians, and many other South American/Eurpoean players)-Love nostalgia?-Love to have fun?-Love getting an extra game with bots in it for free? -Love randomly dying from wallbangs?Great, you've come to the right game. Seriously though, despite the somewhat smaller North American community (Which is still big for the old game it is) it's probably one of the greatest games i've ever come to play, and i've only had it for about a year, and i'm gonna add hundreds of thousands of hours playing this. I don't even have actual friends that play with me yet I can still have fun with this game. From the countless recoil patterns to remember from all the guns, to the extremely friendly community (for the most part) and playing all these classic maps. Yes, of course there's hackers, you'll see a few of them, but they don't ruin the game. Either the server's admin can just ban them or you can just go to a different server, it's not gamebreaking or anything. And besides, if you get this you also get Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, which has bots. Hell, you can even download Zbots for 1.6, and it waypoints for you! Definitely get this game. This game stands the test of time.10/10 Would throw brick-looking grenades at terrorists again.			",163,8,9,2,11,1,3

												I've been playing this game for 10 years (7 or 8 years on non-steam), and it still amazes me with the fact that people are still playing this game. Met bunch of amazing people, learned english more than what school has taught me, joined and left great community every now and then; this game has a huge impact on my life, from personality to the way I see the world (not exaggerating).Some people claimed they have slept with my family, some claimed they are not a hacker (while their crosshair moves furiously, claiming it was an earthquake), some other claimed they can play better if their ping was lower and some other claimed they have tracked my IP and are on the way to kill me. What a super friendly community.Best multiplayer fps game in the history of mankind, never gets me bored with tons of user-made mod, and one thing that this game never cease to amaze me is the fact that this game has a better hitbox than CS:GO (come at me CS:GO plebs)1.6/Counter-Strike, would get rekt by a player playing in the earthquake again			",59,2,0,7,3,1,1

												If you can't get Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, this is great replacement for it. It's not as popular, but it still has a big amount of players. Some servers may be in languages you can't understand, but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill. One of the best first person shooters, that still holds to this day from 1999. Although the game's graphics...aren't really the best. Even then, you can get skins, map textures, etc. to spice the graphics up a little bit. Though to me, graphics don't really matter. Highly recommend this game. 9.5/10			",12,0,0,2,0,0,0

I was in Spanish one day and I was startled as I was daydreaming of CS and I told the teacher I slept with her mother in Spanish. Turns out she's dead.

												The mother of all FPS games! Although some may argue that this is a outdated game, I still love it. You get that awesome freedom of movement which you cannot get on CS:S (as much) and on CS:GO. In addition, this game nearly runs on all pc's even potato's with wires. It has a large modding team behind it (AMXX), which isn't affiliated with Valve but nevertheless it makes the game 100x better, and adds amazing mods to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Counter-Strike was an amazing achievement. A free mod for the original Half-Life that outshone it's parent game completely and become becoming incredibly popular, so popular in fact, that it was sold it stores as a individual entity back when it was still free to download for anyone that already owned Half-Life.Nowadays a mod turning into a full game is almost common place and happens sometimes even without the popularity but back then, it was a monumental accomplishment. Counter-Strike managed to become the most played PC shooter of all time and even to this day boasts both a strong competitive scene and tons of active public servers. How many other online shooters can say that their online community is still alive and kicking 12 years down the line?The game itself I never really cared much for, I played it back in the 5.2 beta days and although there is something to admire about the simplistic purity of it's gameplay this has never been the kind of game I could really get stuck into.The developers tried to introduce a number of new game-modes back in the beta days but quickly found that trying to complicate the game would only leave the players confused and unsure of how to proceed.Counter-Strike is a simplistic teamshooter but it is a milestone in gaming history and one that we should be happy and proud of because Counter-Strike's simple existence is the reason why modding turned mainstream.

												Yeah... the old Counter-Strike.... Everybody know, what CS is..Counter-Strike - My rating - 9/10 Why or Why not to play this old classic ?Positive:It´s a legendary game, and if u playing games like CS:GO etc. u will like it, cause it will be legendary in your library.Almost everybody played CS 1.6 ""from start his cs:go career""Counter-Strike 1.6 is latest and best version on the game, and if u purchase CS, u can play it, if u will download it, there´s is some chance, that u cant play it (Win 8 etc). Most of legens/pro´s in CS:GO played CS 1.6, it´s like beginning, and it could be your beginning! Negative:No more good tournaments on CS 1.6 (On CS:GO are tournaments like EMS, Dreamhack etc.)Graphic+Gameplay - Graphic sucks... but its still better then WarZ:PGameplay.... yeah, crouching sucks, aiming sucks... u know... bad gameplay, if u see CS:GO, when is all so smooth, u will hate CS 1.6... but if u play CS 1.6 before then CS:GO, its good for you, and u will like it (probably:D)So... my opinion is:It´s legendary game, everyone, who likes FPS must have this in his/her:P steam library. :) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Counter-Strike is a pretty old game of ""shooter"", which was developed in 1999, and since 2000, supported by Valve. This game immediately caught on millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation of terrorists and counter-terrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. Objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map, in which the battle.And here is my thoughs...This is the most entertaining video game i've ever played since 2007.I think i've played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day...I finally i bought this game and it's worth 10 bucks indeed.I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it!By that i didn't mean online or with bots but i had lots of LAN-party's in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lan-party's sometimes in my country ^^The game is still fun and it never gets boring!I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER/MIX/PCW/CM/AUTOMIX/BRUSH/ARUSH and more and more and more...It's just fantastic! :D10/10Would recommand it!

												One of the best classic multiplayer games ever! Best gameplay in multiplayer games i've seen.Most People, who play CS:GO never played CS 1.6, which is kinda sad..Not a single CS Game can replace 1.6.Btw. Most E-sport tournaments were held in cs 1.6.So since CS:GO came out, CS 1.6 kinda lost advantage.(Mostly cause of the years it already has.)We will miss you 1.6 <3Thank you for all the love and fun you gave us .. :(R.I.P.Remembrance of Counter-Strike 1.6:

												(I've deleted all the comments on this because I wanted to give a serious review about this game and delete my older one, so here ya go)This is the older Counter-Strike as most people know it. Some people usually don't find enjoyment in playing it due to it being either ""out-dated"" or ""glitchy"". I personally tend to enjoy this game from time to time because it's an original game made from the first Source engine, and old school shooters in general ain't too shabby either. Due to the game having a small amount of space to fill in your computer, it rarely ever lags, which makes sure of no interruptions to your enjoyment. It's also just as Competitive as the present Counter-Strike games, though there isn't any seperate Comp gamemode, unfortunately. But that's something that Valve decided to save for later purposes I suppose. Still the King of FPS Games (IMO), I would definetely recommend playing this if you enjoy tactical teamwork in your Online Gaming.			",97,12,0,7,10,1,5

												Counter-Strike is probably one of the if not the best fps series ever, and it all started from this humble beginning, Counter -Strike 1.6 is a down right one of the greatest classics. It still holds up today, thousands of people play it EVERYDAY, this community has not weakend from 1999 it has gotten stronger, and it is 2014! The competitiveness and skillfulness of CS is so much fun, and no other game can even capture a mere smidge of it. This game also still has competitive servers still today, unlike the newer CS:source which just have casual servers that are only on office and Dust 2. On 1.6 you can find nearly every map (including moded maps), and nearly every game mode (even moded game modes). CS 1.6 still holds up today and it is still so much fun, I give 1.6 a 10 out of 10.

												One of the classics of the shooting genre and precursor to most of today's modern shooters, for all the good and the bad that may imply. Counter-Strike 1.6 is the second iteration of the original Half-Life mod and, quite likely, its most popular incarnation. The rather simplistic gameplay coupled with accessible system requirements and intuitive controls make it one of the most long-lived shooters today, still sporting a massive fanbase.A game that must be tried at least once by any shooting game neophyte.

												Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.			",28,0,1,0,0,0,0

												I haven't written a review in a while but I'd like to do one for this game. Before CS:GO came out I played this game every now and then after school but I normally played Source. I started playing this game after I remember the difficulty and skill needed to handle the aiming in this game and honestly after all these years this game is still amazing, if you get the ""These graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; mindset and focus on the gameplay it's amazing. It's fast-paced and some of the modded maps are insanely detailed. Amazing game with amazing replay value.			",152,10,17,6,10,2,8

												This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.			",11,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best Multiplayer first person shooter game of all time because nothing comes close to this, the more you play this game the more addicted you become and moreover it is fun at all levels of ability. Especially, as you do not need a high end gaming rig to run it, that makes it a game for everyone who likes competitive first person shooter which involves thinking and good aiming skills instead of mindless slaying. It combines the best of team based gaming with an authentic and therefore exciting approach to tactical ops. The ""just one more round"" addiction factor is very high. When you play it properly, with team work that clicks like a well-oiled machine, the game offers a sense of accomplishment and comradery that is simply amazing. Buy it, download it, whatever; just get on board and enjoy it. Sure-fire fun for the online enthusiast. 10/10			",266,55,9,43,20,3,16

Pros:-awesome gameplay-awesome gunplay-nostalgia-teambased-mechanicsCons:-a bit outdated thoughI myself like the classic Counter Strike, but I think there should be big Skillbased MatchMaking Sites like FaceIt or ESEA (if possible even free ones), because the Competetive Mode from Global Offensive is pretty good (even though sometimes it sucks with its rank system). I think, that it is a great game, but perhaps some players will be put off by the old graphics, but these are pretty good, if you imagine, that this game is about 16 years old.

												Best hours I spent in my life (arguably <_<), even after so many years I'm still learning... That's ok because that's what make Counter Srike trully special, the learning curve is so steep that you'll never get bored, if you're up for the challenge of course... This game is the true tactical FPS multiplayer, many new games with fancy graphics try to accomplish what CS 1.6 did and fail terribly.1.6 needs more love from valve, it was one of the games that made steam a 'thing', hell, back in the day it was the ONLY game to bring loyal users to the platform, the games available at the time were very reduced and steam was just an annoyance, to be completely honest we all hated steam, it was a broken nightmare. Valve could show some love for their baby... adding trading cards, bg's and emo's or even skins would be a great start... one call only dream.. :)tl;dr: Steam was very broken and the 1.6 playerbase kept it going, valve should recognize that.

												Recommended. Here is the pros/cons of this game in my humble opinion: PROS	 + Nostalgic+ Buy menu shortcuts+ You can buy bullets as much as you like+ Some unique server mods like Warcraft+ Some unique original maps which don't included later versions of CS (even they are not so great)+ Active community CONS	 - Literally ****ed up server list, probably server owners do that (fake ping/fake player counts etc.)- Except buy menu shortcuts, buy menu isn't so useful (especially if you hit ESC to close the menu, it doesn't works)- Weird hitpoints and lucky headshots- 7/24 ""de_dust2"", ""de_inferno"" playing community			",760,134,28,65,41,11,74

												Recommended. Here is the pros/cons of this game in my humble opinion: PROS	 + Nostalgic+ Buy menu shortcuts+ You can buy bullets as much as you like+ Some unique server mods like Warcraft+ Some unique original maps which don't included later versions of CS (even they are not so great)+ Active community CONS	 - Literally ****ed up server list, probably server owners do that (fake ping/fake player counts etc.)- Except buy menu shortcuts, buy menu isn't so useful (especially if you hit ESC to close the menu, it doesn't works)- Weird hitpoints and lucky headshots- 7/24 ""de_dust2"", ""de_inferno"" playing community			",760,134,28,65,41,11,74

												So I just played the original Counter Strike, CS1.6 for about an hour and after over 100 hours of both CSS and CSGO, this game is AMAZING! But so different! I love this game and its game series! It taught me tactical gameplay and how much communication is key but this game lacks a bit of that but not much. I absolutely love this and highly recommend it!			",381,83,9,58,33,3,48

												El mejor juego de shooter en la historia, en su tiempo, eran los mejores graficos, lanzado el 18 de junio de 1999, en sus antiguas versiones, finalmente el 1 de noviembre del 2000, se lanzó el juego que cambió la historia, Counter-Strike.El juego se fue arreglando por parte de Valve, el juego estaba rotisimo, disparar saltando, corriendo, etc.Trae demasiados modos, Zombie Escape, Surf, Deathmatch, y miles de modos más que te traerán muchas horas de juego.Lo malo que ya Counter-Strike ya no se juega en las competiciones, lo que ahora lo hace el Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, nadie se quería mudar en ese tiempo a ese juego, a nadie le gustaba, y por eso Valve, tuvo que sacar Counter-Strike de las competiciones, para obligar que los jugadores se pasaran a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.+ GRAN Cantidad de mapas (comunidad)+ Jugadores + Jugabilidad+ Adictivo y divertido.+ Multijugador.- Sistema VAC apesta.- Demasiados bugs.¿Quieres un juego donde pasaras miles de horas y baratisimo? Tienes que comprarlo. :)			",29,3,2,0,0,0,0

												Few years ago, we first heard that CS 1.6 is dead, some organizations have dismissed their CS - team, people screaming that the game is dead and we need to move to CS: GO. It seems that now it is not so! If you pay attention to the broadcast with IEM 6 WC, we see that CS 1.6 By Views prevzashla SC 2, not only is this game broke all past their records. So why CS 1.6 is dead? I beg to differ. According to spectators IEM 6 CS was the best in the tournament. I think CS 1.6 hardly died, she would die only if we want to do! As for CS: GO it grows, developers even began to read the ""Feedback"", the game has changed a lot of things. Open Beta -version of the game was to be released after the new year, but I think the developers have not yet sufficiently satisfied with the result. As for the keys to the CS: GO, something I'm working on that would get a couple of the key for you guys! I will write how I succeed!			",598,206,25,52,33,3,74

												Can shoot terrorists and be terrorist. Can plant bomb as terrorist.Counter-Strike predicting ISIS before it even existed confirmed? More updates as they come.UPDATE: Valve has replied to my message, and only said ""Never email us again or we will ban your Steam account"". Yes. So I wondered, what if I ran this through my decoder machine? So I ran it through my decoder machine. And it came out as this lonely message: Trump did 7/11.What could it mean? I'm not really sure. I'll keep you guys posted.UPDATE #2: I've done extensive research, and it appears that this decoded message either means that Donald J. Trump owns a large chain of convenience stores, or that he is an international terrorist threat. At this point I'm not entirely sure which it is. If you have insight into this topic, please reach me at xXilluminartyboizXx@internetexplorer.com. Thanks.UPDATE #3: This might be my final update. I found a note slipped into my underwear when I woke up this morning. It was adressed from Valve. I opened it, naturally. Inside was one, simple sentence: Trump sees all. Guys, listen, I don't know for sure if Trump did 7/11, or he made ISIS, or anything, but it's been fun trying to figure it out. If I don't make it to another update, and they get to me first, just tell my hamster Poochins that I loved him. Peace out.			",280,74,8,17,17,3,17

												After 16 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayer games in the world.it's one of the best shouter games ever made !! you can't get bored of this one, trust me i have about 1.3k hours here on steam & more than 2k on the non steam version =)but ppl left it to play ""modern games"" like cs go & battlefield & COD .. what a shame !!there still some alive communities & servers so don't be afraid ... but the sad thing is that there are many cheaters (you will get used to see them anyways, thank god there are many admins who can take care of them)i love this game so much but after all maybe this it's the right time to let it go. maybe one day i will comeback to find it alive again like the old days, maybe one day :)anyways, i totally recommend this game for everyone! don't be shy go buy it now if you didn't already do !"" this is a must have one !""

												I used to play this game with my friends when we had to do military service; it was a lot of fun pretending that we were fighting Russians while putting to use what we would learn during training. However, it seems that the only people who play now are Turkish children who hack and have bad ping so, I would not recommend this game any more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1999 is when this came out, but when I was born. Gladly though I grew up to find out and discover about this magnificent piece. There was no other game that I played once I purchased this with some B-Day cash on Steam. First time playing, I got mutilated like the noob I was, but when I started playing more often, I became better and everyone else can too. This isn't like the CODs or Battlefields that I have played here and there today. No it's much more different. Counter-Strike is a Tactical FPS which relies on teamwork and tactics more than fast paced arcade action. You don't unlock weapons, you buy them with cash earned from kiling enemies, completeing objectives, or winning rounds although you still get a little for loosing. Think of the game as Cops & Robbers. Robbers blow things up and the Cops don't them too.On the extra note, this game has probably one of the best modding communities out there. There too much to do or put in here but I can slam a bit down.-Zombies Survival/Escape-Soccer (Or Football for the Europeans)-Surf-Bhop/KZ (Climbing Zone)-Pokemod-Gungame (Those new may have heard such from Call of Duty's spinoff)-And more, etc.So now that I've explained the game I guess I can lay down some pro's yet con's to playing Counter-Strike 1.6PROS-Fun/Unlimited Gameplay possibilities-Booming community that has been alive for 15 years-Plethora of servers to choose from-Competetive and Casual at the same time-Fun to play with a group of friends-More skill based than many other games out there-Cheap priceCONS-Graphics from 1998 may seem slightly offputting-Not an easy game to jump right into, as it takes lots of time to become better-May seem repetitive after a whileI came into CS late. But, I'm glad this was the first one I owned.			",176,5,0,8,6,0,3

												This game changed gaming as a whole. One of the best FPS of all time, if not the best. But its all about the gameplay. Its how CS plays that will get you. Huge online community, thousands of mods, nostalgic graphics, excellent gameplay, nice sound effects even if they r outdated. CS 1.6 is my favorite FPS and is much better than Global Offensive in all aspects. I played this game so much before i got Steam, this game is just spetacular. Even in non-steam gaming, lan houses,competitive play, CS 1.6 is still incredibly popular. 10/10, congratulations to the developers.			",127,39,2,14,13,2,13

												+Competetive.Easy to play.Can Include AI for training.Tons of servers/server plugins/custom maps/even custom guns.Fun to play, always.-Little repeating.In overall, I recommend it to everyone, please do not judge this game for graphics and/or lack of military actions, GoldSrc engine is not Real Virtuality 3 ( Arma 2 engine ), and this game is old school, typical classic so graphics are what they are.

Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.			",265,83,11,59,39,5,49

												Bought this game a bit too late... wish I would've been around to play it back in it's prime.This game is simply a classic. My first Counter-Strike was Source. I loved Source a lot, and that lead to me getting CS:GO. CS:GO is now my most played game. ANYWAYS, I bought this game pretty recently and I love playing it. Too bad the servers are bugged I think, otherwise, still has an alright community. great gameplay and requires a lot of skill.I love the wallbanging and the style you have to shoot. Not so much run n gun like the other games in the series.I definitely recommend this game. Even though I doubt many people are still buying this game!			",192,18,4,23,16,1,13

												There is no words to describe how good this game is. I've spent so many hours playing (even though having only 1000hrs in this account). This is my favorite game, and it will always be. I've become a gamer 'coz of this game and i just hope there are people who had the honor of playing the best FPS game ever made. Just buy it and enjoy!			",63,19,2,1,6,2,3

												The classic action FPS: Counter-Strike, has made a huge impact on my gaming life, ever since I was a pre-pubscent,6 year old child. Enjoying various betas and versions throughout it's development, the game has evolved from a mod for Half-Life, to one of the most viewed and played eSports. If you haven't already, buy it,play it and enjoy it. I have nailed countless of hours on different accounts I've had, and of course the non-steam versions10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There can't be better than 1.6 throughout all these years playing it since I didn't even know what's steam.Buying the original game feels way better than non-steam no lag experience as some of you say.It's hella worth the time spent it's been almost 7 years for me playing this game since I was a kid. My childhood and maybe later would be my adulthood also being spent on it. The amount of mods/servers are unbelievable! all of them are amazing as I tried them all. I can't deny that I am addicted to it but, yet! It's hella worth to re-born and be played like the past times! Tournaments and more. I can't withstand the ignorance of valve to it's amazing old games!Just remember that before cs go came out, your success was not in CS:S or CS:CZ it was all in this game. <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not one to criticise a game but, this has to be a great title mostly for it's ""Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role,"" system even if it had many problems. The gameplay is great with plenty of user created content to play. Vanilla gameplay is not advised as it gets repetitive fast. Overall gameplay is a 8.5 out of ten. The sound isn't very good with it's annoying tracks, the only way to fix this is to download custom gun sounds but thats a pain. The sound wasn't even good in 2000 when the game came out and thats telling you something. Overall 4.0 out of a possible ten. I know this is odd for me to review a game off of this but online community. The community if few and far between, there are BARELY any good servers up and sometimes the community is awful. (still not as bad as team fortress 2 IMO XD) Overall 6.0 out of ten. Graphics usually take the backseat in my reviews but, I do have to say the graphics are OK I mean in 2000 they still weren't as good as UNREAL 1 or IDTECH 3 but they get the job done. Overall 6.5 out of ten. My verdict is that this game is good and still is I have to say this is a damn fine game earning my score as an 80% out of 100% (BTW This is all criticism because, I AM A CRITIC.) (I go into detail about every problem a game has.) Therefore I recommend. Monstercat signing out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The greatest multiplayer shooter experience I've had since Quake 1. The e-sport scene also helped it alot, it's the only computer game I've really followed when it comes to e-sports (back when I followed the CPL etc). The design of the game was simple but very effective and delivered a multiplayer experience that few other games can match. The Call of Duty and Battlefield titles, although good in their own right, never drew me in like Counter-Strike.			",210,55,11,21,16,7,17

												This is not a game. This is a life.I'm so sorry that there are too much cheaters on servers, but if Valve can make it better , it would be great :D Remember old good times, waiting to start a new match between Na'Vi and fNatic <3 And all other teams... Then somebody made a cheat, and destroyed a game. This game changed many lives, many people. I think this game become the world best game ever. For me, it's the best game. I play it every day, but it isn't like sometimes. Now graphic is important. Well, it isn't. I know that this game is dead already... I want to get it back, but there is no way to do that.Cheaters are everywhere now. In every single game. You can buy cheat for CS:GO for 5$ I think... My friend bought it. I asked him : "" Why did you bought that ? Isn't it better to enjoy playing the game without cheats? "" He told me: "" I want to beat everyone. I want to be the best. No one can stop me now. ""I don't know why are you doing it, this is beautiful game. When I played it for the first time, it was awesome :D Finally a game that I can play with my friends on LAN. And, till today, I'm playing it. I never downloaded a cheat. I don't need that. I want to learn how to play, to be the beast in the world... Now everyone is wanting money, money money... I heard about CS:GO Lounge aka CS GO betting site. Now everyone is watching matches because of skins, to get free money... Well, when I was young, in 2005. I waited with my friends a CS 1.6 match. It was beautiful. Now i sit here, and watch this CS:GO matches... So many people watch matches... But 90% watch them because of f***ing bet...It will never be like sometimes... Or we can change everything...Valve please, get this game back to life <3Thanks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Counter-Strike (англ. «Контрудар»; сокр. CS или КС, разг. контра́) — культовая серия компьютерных игр[13] в жанре командного шутера от первого лица, основанная на движке GoldSrc, изначально появившаяся как модификация игры Half-Life. Всего в основной серии вышло пять версий игры, последняя и самая популярная из которых — Counter-Strike 1.6. Существуют и отдельные части, например, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (мультиплеер с одиночными заданиями) и Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes (сюжетная игра), основанные на движке GoldSource, а также Counter-Strike: Source, основанная на более современном движке Source. 14.08.11 Valve официально презентовала Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, которая вышла 21 августа 2012 года[14].Counter-Strike — популярная многопользовательская игра, имеет поддержку сетевых и одиночных игр (с ботами). Некоторые аналитики считают, что в настоящее время Counter-Strike 1.6 теряет популярность по мере появления у игроков более мощных ПК, поддерживающих современные игры с более красивой графикой и усовершенствованными физическими движками[15][16]. В 2007—2008 годах наметился обратный процесс — укрепления позиций CS 1.6 как турнирной дисциплины[17][18]. Множество людей по всему миру не спешат покинуть ряды виртуальных бойцов Counter-Strike. Прежде всего это связано со ставшим привычным геймплеем.Основная идея игры — противостояние двух команд — Террористов (Terrorist team, T) и Спецназа (Counter-Terrorist team, CT). Каждый игрок при входе в игру выбирает команду, за которую он хочет играть, либо возможность быть наблюдателем — Spectator — если это предусмотрено настройками игрового сервера.Цель игры — выполнить задание карты или уничтожить противников. За выполненные задания и уничтоженных противников игрок получает деньги, которые может потратить на покупку оружия. (Проигравшая команда также получает деньги, но существенно меньше)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Counter-Strike:I started playing cs when I was just 4 years old .Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair.'Very Addictive Game :p			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Counter-Strike was one of the first video games I have ever played and will always be up there in my list of favorite games.I had just installed it. It was my first multiplayer game and I though I'm too new to play against players so I played only with bots slowly progressing from easy to to the hard ones. Then one day I joined a Dust II DM server. It was chaotic, but fun. I didn't even know the map then, but I learned it by playing lots of DM. I slowly climbed the integrated server ranks and made friends with one of the admins...then after a while the server disappeared.After that I found out about deathrun. I was horrible at it, but the regulars helped me and I started visiting the server more and more. Apparently the same server chain had a gun game server too. Now that was amazing. Completely different people played there, but again friendly ones. After a couple of months the server chain was shut down...I continued playing aim, awp, jailbreak and other mods. I didn't even play the classic mode, it wasn't of that big interest to me, though after a couple of months I stopped playing CS.I can't not recommend this game, because I have so many memories from it. Nostalgia.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember being a younger kid,  I had a brother take me out and walk for about 30 minutes to a gaming cafe where they have this game being played 90% of all computers.   Playing this for the first time as a kid, I felt it was so realistic lol.   It was like being in a new world, basically.    We came back to gaming cafe every once a while whenever we can afford it.  One time, my dad came home early and we were not home, lol.  Somehow, he figured out where we were at!    Good times good times!  This is one of few games that made my childhood memories.

												This game ruined my life. It's an awesome title! I never knew a game 14 years old would be so good and still, it's active in the community! That's really nice! This game is a huge hit in the market and still there are lots of buyers. It is a little thought for a guy like me who just plays non fps games.But still, it is really interesting and amazing to play with friends and online too!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite possibly the purest form of First Person Shooter, only rivaled by Quake. In my opinion, it is undoubtedly the best game out of the Counter-Strike series. Only downside with this game, is that it has already had its primetime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Un joc antrenant care iti pune la incercare calmul si agilitatea in timpul luptelor dintre teroristi si contra-teroristi. Totusi este invechit, are mai mult de 10 ani de la aparitie si a dominat toate competitiile adevarate de gaming. Oricum, pentru pasionatii jocurilor FPS este perfect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
