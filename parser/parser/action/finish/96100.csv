												Defy Gravity is a platformer with a simple concept:  Get from point A to point B by creating attraction/repulsion areas.  The game is simple but fun, and provides a good challenge during the second half of the game.  It can be tricky but the checkpoints are placed in such a way that you're willing to take risks and try new ideas to get past some obstacle - a very important attribute for puzzle games.The only thing that is sub par is the animation (or lack of).  It isn't really needed, but the game has the GameMaker feel, a bunch of sprites just moving around the screen with a short walking animation, which I find kind of off putting.  It isn't important, but it should be mentioned.If you like physics manipulation games or platformers, then I recommend buying this.  The game is $3 at the time of this writing, more than worth it.

												It's hard not to recommend this, given that I made a 7 cent profit from buying the game then selling the cards... getting paid to play a game is never wrong. :-)But even ignoring that, I had a surprisingly good time with it. Defy Gravity is your basic puzzle platformer where you have to use an unusual mechanic to navigate levels. In this case, you can shoot gravity fields that attract you or repel you and activate a shield that lets you ignore all gravity fields. By mixing these, you can sort of rocket-jump-grapple-hook your way through levels. Some timed jumping and obstacles that sometimes are and sometimes are not affected by the gravity are there to stop your progress.In the words of a wise man, you're going to die. A lot. The game takes delight in throwing stuff in your way at just the wrong moment. But at the same time, it's surprisingly forgiving with how you swing around the level and you can often brute force your way through tight spots. ""Hectic"" is not a word you usually associate with puzzlers, but Defy Gravity can get pretty hectic -- and that's when it's arguably at its most fun. For me it hits just the right balance between frustration and challenge.The graphics and sound are absolutely nothing special, but in terms of pure gameplay, this is value for money even when it's not 90% off. When it is, of course, it's a no-brainer, just get it. :-) ",136,36,1,17,7,2,27

												I just bought it for cards admittedly (at $0.29), but I actually found it rather fun to play instead of just idling. The game is short so I have to say only buy it on a major sale, but well worth the time if these kind of games interest you.Gameplay wise it is a fun platformer, and does remind me a bit of Portal. It isn't an exact copy though, instead of Portals, you manipulate Gravity to repel and attract yourself and other objects. The momentum and physics of the game is fun to toy with, though it CAN be frustrating at times. Checkpoints are placed in fair spots of most stages to reduce frustration, but later stages stretch this out quite a bit so you will have to keep on your toes or be prepared to die again and again.I did beat the main story but I decided to leave before continuing deep into hard mode. It takes away one of your powers and while I do feel that's an interesting challenge, I'm satisfied with just beating the main modes.			",339,69,13,39,21,4,31

OverviewDefy Gravity Extended is a small game, with only a few tricks, but does it very well. It lacks the flair of a quality game, but once you go in and try it, it certainly redeems itself. In this game, you play as a spacesuit wearing gravitymancer trying to pass the gauntlet. You are equipped with a gravity gun (not the HL type!) and have to traverse many levels to prove your worth!The Pros:Simple Concept - If you can make a simple game fun, you have succeeded as a developer. The game mechanics are very simple. You move about, and create two types of ""portals"". One that has a strong gravitational pull and one that repels objects. You can also activate a shield around you that negates any gravity effects. Leaving breaking the laws of physics aside, you must combine these simple actions in order to get yourself to the exit.Good Level Design - I'm not talking about the aesthetics, of course! I'm referring to the level layout, the challenges you face, their diversity, their difficulty. It impressed me how challenging this game became in later levels, without repeating itself throughout. The levels are many times relying on sinusoidal patterns and geometric arrays of projectiles!Challenging - The levels begin increasingly harder, and some are outright stressful. If you are looking for something to test your skill and patience with, you've come to the right place!Good Music - The background music is a nice relaxing tune that suits the space environment we are supposed to be in. Really helps ease out the stress from those hard levels.Cheap - The game is 0.99€ at normal price and can go all the way down to 0.09€ when on sale. So, just give it a try, it will cost you basically nothing. (Not to mention it has Steam Trading Cards)Achivements! - Few achievements, only requirement is passing the game. Sounds easy, huh? It's not, but good luck, hunters!The Cons:Ugly Visuals - The textures aren't eye candy and everything is flat and pixelated. While I'm not saying a game is good if it looks good, it wouldn't hurt getting a little face lift every now and then.Shabby Animations - The animations are barely existent, sometimes movement may seem plastic, especially the way your character tilts its body when looking at the cursor.Conclusion:Defy Gravity Extended is certainly not a game for everyone, so if you don't like skill-based platformers with minimal controls, then look elsewhere. If however, you like that sort of thing and still have the pocket change from grocery shopping, then consider giving it a go!If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

However, a great difficulty awaits you because you have only the first gun in the hard mode.

												Defy Gravity (henceforth known as DG) is an example of what a small indie game should be.Gameplay:Based on two types of gravity spheres, one pushing you away and one pulling you towards it. Using these you have to traverse levels and bounce/throw yourself across pits. Overall the gameplay is simple, standard WASD and mouse, plus having support for a controller. Graphics&Sound:What are you expecting out of an indie game? The sound is above average, as the music is pretty nice. The graphics are typical, though not bad enough to be annoying. The one complaint i do have with this game is that your character looks as if he's using a Super Soaker rather than a gravity gun. The Good: I got this when it was on sale for $.14 (yes, 14/100) and it was a nice, cheap pickup. It'll provide a good amount of fun.The Bad: The controls are a bit wonky and some of the levels require split-second reactions.Overall Grade: C+ Not Bad, but it's a small game, good to play if you got a few minutes to kill.

Fun gameplay for about 15 minutes2.) Alright music for a cheap indie game3.) Controller support (If you like that)4.) Really inexpensive alternative to the Portal franchiseCons:1.)

I haven't finished the game, as i'm stuck in stage 5, but with enough effort you can finish it and feel the joy of completing such a difficult task.I'd say this game is well worth the full price for its gameplay, soundtrack and challenge, but you may as well wait for a promotion, as the price goes down an insane amount (around 90%).

												Defy Gravity Extended it's an indie game based in physics / gravity laws. It could looks like a horrible game. I mean art and animations are simple and it can feels empty, otherwise it's too challenging. You can feel that it's a 2D version of ""Portal"", you have a gun that has two functions, repel and attract.Something that i loved in this game was the relaxing background music that makes you relax during stressful levels.It has enough good levels and after finish it the nightmare haven't finished yet, you have to complete it twice in order to get all achievements, something that will make you rage.It's always on discount (95% off i guess), so if your style it's the challenges you can give it a chance.7.5 / 10If you found this review helpful you can find out more at our Completing the Backlog's Curator page.

												Decent puzzle and platformer game that involves placing gravity and anti-gravity wells strategically across hazards and obstacles Kara must travel across to reach the exit in every stage. There are approximately 21 levels altogether, plus the same 21 levels for the real Gauntlet mode where Kara may only place gravity wells. Although some levels can be frustrating due to the random and unpredictable movement patterns of some of the hazards, the game is forgiving and has checkpoint locations to enable instant retries at each checkpoint location along various intervals in each level.

												This game was a lot of fun and very reminiscent of the early 2000s online flash games, which gave me a wonderful nostalgic feeling all throughout the game. This puzzle-platformer is straightforward, however reaching your end goal can and will be difficult. The simplicity and correct execution of this game's design creates that unique feeling, where the player knows finishing this level is solely due to the player’s ability to perform. No game exploits, no grinding to get to a certain level or luck driven events. Just simple, skill-based levels with original and adaptive gameplay.Granted that not everyone is into 2D flash puzzle-platformers, this game may not be what everyone is looking for, however if you do purchase this game and give it the time of day, I think you might be pleasantly surprised at how much fun you'll have.Extra - The authentic soundtrack is very atmospheric and enjoyable.

												Tough platforming game, but worth the cheap price you can find it at, or especially when it goes on sale you can easily find it for less than a buck.  The goal, to reach the end of each level offering a different level of difficulty with different obstacles.  The gimmick, a double jump ability and an anti-gravity/well-gravity gun.  Using both of these while stagnant is easy though tricky, but when you have to use them while on the run can prove quite difficult and at times frustrating.  The hard mode features only the well-gravity gun.  Beating this latter mentioned segment proved really difficult and a true test of the puzzle and platforming skills.  I did find a few odd issues.  At times the screen would go black when loading or reloading a level.  Shooting would fix the problem, however, if the level was saved at a save point, you may need to act quickly, shooting and eliminating your gravity shot then moving forward when given limited time only added to the difficulty and when it's unnecessary difficulty, it made it really bad.  The graphics are simple, the sound and music forgettable, but it's the gameplay that wins this game a recommendation.Overall though, I did appreciate the tests and found the game worthy of playing and I do recommend it for you if you can deal with proper frustration and sometimes improper and unnecessary frustrations.

												Defy Gravity Extended is a puzzle platformer game where you play as Kara, a gravitymancer. You will use a gun that places gravity wells and anti-gravity wells. You will use them often to solve various puzzles throughout the game. Gravity well pulls you into its center, while anti-gravity wells repels you from its center.Defy Gravity Extended has a very unique game mechanic, it is quite different than most puzzle platformer games I've played. The soundtrack for this game is very nice and relaxing too. You can get 100% achievements just by finishing the game. I like that the game doesn't make you finish a level in a particular time so you won't be pressured while playing. The game has 24 levels and certainly doesn't lack in challenge. There is also a checkpoint system in the game, so if you die, you won't start from the beginning which is nice.However, for me, it is more frustrating than It is to enjoy while playing this game. The controls are a little bit difficult. I don't like the animation. The game looks very unappealing to me. The game lacks on the options menu. You can't adjust the game's volume at all, so you will need to change it from Windows or your speaker. It also lacks in resolution options too. The game at one point crashes, but it wasn't in a middle of a level. The story is pretty much non-existent.In conclusion, Defy Gravity Extended is a unique and very challenging game. But it is very frustrating to play. I don't enjoy this game very much, maybe because this game isn't for me. The price seems a little fair though. But I do not recommend buying this full price since it goes on sale quite often. I do recommend purchasing this game on sale because it's usually on sale for 90% off or more.			",81,14,0,16,24,0,16

												Tough platforming game, but worth the cheap price you can find it at, or especially when it goes on sale you can easily find it for less than a buck.  The goal, to reach the end of each level offering a different level of difficulty with different obstacles.  The gimmick, a double jump ability and an anti-gravity/well-gravity gun.  Using both of these while stagnant is easy though tricky, but when you have to use them while on the run can prove quite difficult and at times frustrating.  The hard mode features only the well-gravity gun.  Beating this latter mentioned segment proved really difficult and a true test of the puzzle and platforming skills.  I did find a few odd issues.  At times the screen would go black when loading or reloading a level.  Shooting would fix the problem, however, if the level was saved at a save point, you may need to act quickly, shooting and eliminating your gravity shot then moving forward when given limited time only added to the difficulty and when it's unnecessary difficulty, it made it really bad.  The graphics are simple, the sound and music forgettable, but it's the gameplay that wins this game a recommendation.Overall though, I did appreciate the tests and found the game worthy of playing and I do recommend it for you if you can deal with proper frustration and sometimes improper and unnecessary frustrations.

												This game was absolutely fantastic. It has an original concept, and good application. It was challenging, fun, infuriating at times, and immensely satisifying to complete. The storyline is relatively simple - as are the controls. You will almost always be able to understand how a level should be beat, but the application will still be somewhat challenging, and may require a few attempts. Once you've beaten the game, there is a secondary playthrough which removes one of your abilities, rendering the game a completely different approach - needing more planning and less random leaping about. It assumes you know how the mechanics work at that point, then puts your knowledge to the test. The game was a bit short, but well paced. I would happily buy the game again, and at it's current price, it is more than worthwhile, even just to test it out.			",98,9,0,16,2,2,4

												""Release Date: 18 Mar, 2016"" Fake release date. This game has been out for at least a year, maybe 2 even. The release date has changed simply so that the game will appear on the Steam store front. Very fishy action from this dev and this should not be alowed on Steam. The new release date is simply fake and false. I played it for 5 minutes and crashed 5 times by pressing W at the start point. Seems to be made with Unity (or Clickteam), but badly coded. I also looked al the reviews and most of them now show up a 'pre release' due to the fake release date. Not to mention that a lot of the reviews seems to be super positive with a 10 minute total play time, so I call those fake too. I can't really check how good/bad the game is ,because I crash every minute just by pressing a key. This game does not seem to be something to be super positive about.Edit: apparently the game was released on steam in 2011.			",148,11,15,23,22,1,29

♥♥♥♥ Gravity - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Man has long yearned to fly among the stars. To be in space. The final frontier. There's all kinds of cool things up there, all of which could kill everyone on our planet in the blink of an eye. We could all just be a little flickering candle of a planet, snuffed out by the flap of a little space butterfly's wing. It's pretty cool.We've obviously never really been in space though, or on the moon. That's a conspiracy perpetuated by Richard Nixon and the Disney Channel. You don't want to believe the lies, but it makes people happy. Just like the tooth fairy or the concept of chivalry. You can believe whatever you like, but really all they want is to get in your mouth and leave some money on your nightstand.While humanity will probably never REALLY be in space, because space is actually also a conspiracy that Disney Channel likes to keep going for their ""special interests"", we can imagine what this fictitious place called outer space is like through video games. Yeah!According to the legends, people can float in space. There's a force that pulls things towards planets, but there's none of it in space. ""Gravity"", they call it. It's apparently what holds us onto Earth. Even though everyone knows that we're actually held to the Earth's surface by the natural paste on our feet and shoes. If you ever sprayed non-stick cooking spray on your feet, you'd float into the sun and die.But gravity makes for an interesting theoretical concept, and an even better game. Defy Gravity, which has also apparently been Extended, is a sweet little gem of a PC game you can get on Steam.Defy Gravity is a little budget puzzle platformer. Nothing too fancy. I probably bought it for a quarter. But definitely a quarter well-spent. It's short, sweet, fun, and surprisingly smart.There's a definite Portal vibe going on here, and it's at least mildly Metroid-inspired in some way. Your character controls gravity with their gun, which is capable of shooting two different colors to make pushy gravity and pully gravity. They also PLOT TWIST ARE GIRL WITH BOOBIES. GIRLS CAN PLAY GAMES TOO.WHEN HE TAKES HIS HELMET OFF AND HAS THE BOOBS SO YOU KNOW IT'S FEMINISM.DID YOU KNOW GIRLS CAN DO THINGS.Defy Gravity packs a lot of punch for a simple game. I can count the amount of stage hazards on my fingers. And yet the way they're combined is never dull. It's a short, compact game. There's not a super bountiful amount of content. But for what you're paying for, they squeeze every little drop of game out of it.Most puzzle games need to be this huge♥♥♥♥♥Rube Goldberg type of thing. There's so many things everywhere, and you need to remember all these different elements that interact with one another in all these ways. And when all of that combines, you can pop a balloon or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Defy Gravity has like, a brick and some lemons. One lemon has a nail wedged into it. There's a dog. And yet they manage to pop the ♥♥♥♥ out of so many balloons. There's some really memorable levels with only those elements. It's humble, and it's simple. But it's smart, it's fun, and it's well-worth the quarter I spent on it.It's a budget title for sure. Everything seems to follow the basic theme of ""Not amazing, but for a quarter this is pretty nice"". It's not meant to be the biggest, most impressive game you can buy. Graphically, it's incredibly simplistic. It almost looks like it was done in Flash or something. The sprites are decent, but everything is very basic looking. The graphics work though. They're unimpressive, but they're not ugly. It has a nice look to it, the sprites are well made, and the general art direction and style works.Its game design and mechanics are its biggest selling point. It's not even particularly long. It's pretty short actually. But it's a brutal platformer later in the game, so it can definitely take you a few hours to complete with the excellently done difficulty ramp considered. And if you're a sucker for brutal puzzle-platforming, the extra Hard mode post-game is enough to frustrate most platformer fans.There was clearly some love put into the game. It's well-designed and has a nice coat of polish. Cheap polish, yeah. Not the name brand polish that all the super models use. More like store brand Kmart polish. It'll get the job done. Might even look nice. They'll never know, probably. Your mother-in-law will be able to tell, and she'll gossip about it to everyone just to spite you. You ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. But no one else will notice otherwise.It's a nice game. It's pretty nice. Better than most things you'd buy on Steam for the price. It's like the difference between putting your quarter in a fancy machine with flashy lights and junk, and giving your quarter to a homeless heroin addict. You want to pay for the nice machine, not only to reward yourself with the gumball but to reward the nice people that took the time to build this nice machine. You don't want to flip a quarter to a guy that's gonna save up to shoot himself up with heroin, break into your house and♥♥♥♥♥♥your guinea pig or your sister or something. Think of the guinea pigs.

PresentationDefy Gravity follows a similar road with some other platformers we've seen lately, using space as a foundation for the game, as you take control of one of the Gravitymancers who came to the Gauntlet, the ultimate test, in order to prove themselves. However, where other platformers with a similar pattern such as The Swapper manage to tell an interesting and unique story using the darkness and emptiness of space, Defy Gravity only introduces you to the Gauntlet, without actually telling you what it really is, what purpose does it serve and why would anyone risk their lives just to prove that they can get to the end. It is quite obvious that story isn't the main focus here, but even so it's hard not to notice the missed opportunity, since The Gauntlet itself could've been filled with messages from others who tried and were defeated by The Gauntlet or pretty much anything at all to justify your desire to finish it; instead you're left with a left to right Mario-style platformer without any princess at the end.Rating: 4GameplayThe gameplay is based around the use of gravity wells, which can be created using your gun, in addition to the ones that are already placed on the map and cannot be moved; using those wells properly and learning how they influence other objects is key in Defy Gravity, as almost every puzzle is based on how well you manage to use the gravity wells depending on position, as well as timing. There are two types of gravity wells: positive and negative; the positive wells will attract objects towards them, including yourself, while the negative ones will repel them, and combining those wells with your anti-gravity shield that makes you immune to all wells is what makes the gameplay unique and interesting. The whole concept does wear out by the end of the game, as there won't be any new ideas introduced into the game later on, leaving you mostly with more bouncing objects to avoid in order to make the game harder, something that does happen once you finish the game and Hard mode is unlocked, disabling negative gravity wells and changing a few things in each level in order to make it more challenging.Rating: 8.5GraphicsThe first thing you will probably notice are the backgrounds, which look amazing and change from level to level, but what on the other hand, the levels themselves are designed using the same monotone, gray blocks and the only thing that differentiates them one from another is the layout of those gray blocks and the bouncing objects between them. The visual effects are basic and nothing stands out, mostly because no beam or ray of light can move your eyes away from the galaxies in the background.Rating: 5AudioThe tunes are okay, but since there is no story or momentum to what is happening, this is probably one of those titles you'll play with your own music in the background. The sound effects feel absent most times, as they are either too quiet or not in total sync with the action, but then again you probably won't need those anyway.Rating: 4.5ExtrasFor its 3€ price tag, Defy Gravity offers enough to justify the purchase, even if you can finish the game in less than two hours, adding 2-3 more hours to that time if you're down for the Hard mode, but if you are looking for anything extra, there is nothing more to the game than the adventure itself.Rating: 7VerdictDefy Gravity is an okay platformer if you only care about the gameplay, as it does introduce a new concept even if it only lasts for a short time, but for anything else you might expect from this game, you will probably be disappointed.Rating Overall: 5.8Check out the full review and a lot more about Defy Gravity at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=366 ",142,34,2,13,6,2,7

Defy Gravity Extended is a very nice and short game that will satisfy anyone who has had enough of mindless shootings. The biggest asset is obviously the freedom to choose while solving puzzles and a feeling that the laws of physics are at our mercy. The graphics and music are perfectly matched. Everything is in its place and a pleasure for both the eye and the ear. So take a gun in hand and ... go right? Yes. It's just a simple, small, modest low-budget minigame.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

Gameplay'Defy Gravity' is a platformer that uses physics (gravity). It has the usual jump-or-die and dodge-or-die mechanics, but you can also create two kinds of wells: a gravity well that pulls you and certain objects towards it an anti-gravity well that repels you and certain objects away from itAdd to that the option to switch on a body shield, which renders you immune to all gravity and anti-gravity effects, and you have some nice mechanics to play with.DifficultyI'm not a big fan of the platformer genre because I find standard platformers too 'twitchy' for my taste. But occasionally, I wil try a platformer game that has some special mechanics like the wells in 'Defy Gravity'. So you need to read the rest of this section knowing that I'm only a very casual platformer gamer.I have to admit I liked 'Defy Gravity' and I had a lot of fun until the 'Grandmaster levels'. Judging from the Steam Achievements, that's almost halfway through the game. At that point, you get a warning screen letting you know that the game is kicking it up a notch and is about to get - and I quote: ""much more difficult"".I noticed in the first 'Grandmaster level' that the game was no longer my cup of tea because it got way too difficult and yes, too twitchy for me. But I suppose for hardcore platformer gamers, the fun would only just begin at that point. I would like to point out that all the footage seen in the demo video here on Steam is from pre-Grandmaster levels. I'm not saying that's a conspiracy on the makers' part or something like that, it's just so you know when looking at that footage and thinking to yourself 'that doesn't look too hard to me'.Graphics and soundThe graphics are ok. They are nothing special but certainly good enough for a game of its genre. I invite you to take a look at the video and the screen shots to judge for yourself.A lot of reviewers don't like the music. I can relate to that but personally, it didn't bother me and I have a low tolerance for annoying music and sounds. For the most part, I even thought the music was nice and at least fitting for the game. So it's clearly a matter of personal taste and let's leave it at that.There are no options whatsoever for graphics or sound. A word about the Steam extras'Defy Gravity' has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 just for running the game.The Steam Achievements are uninspired. They are limited to your classic 'pass x number of levels and get an achievement'. If you just play through the 'easy' part of the game, you'll end up with 4/8 so a 50% completion rate.			",232,141,2,44,9,3,34

												You get an excellent puzzle platformer for this price. It mixes mechanics that are a bit similar to Portal's mechanics with Braid's platforming (or jumping, really). Of course the game has its own style and own mechanics, so don't expect a clone of the games I just mentioned. The graphics are extremely simple, but they get the job done. I absolutely love detailed, well animated 2D graphics, so I'm a little bit disappointed, but for this price, I guess I can't really complain. The gameplay is the most important factor here and I have absolutely no complaints about that. Controls work well, but take some time getting used to though. The game is also quite forgiving in parts where you die. It makes the game fun and removes the frustrating parts. But don't expect an easy game. It will still take some skill to finish it. Go for it ![Rating: 78/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Nailing that feeling of satisfaction when you’ve figured out a solution to the task at hand is very difficult. Not all mechanics allow it and not all games offer more than one route from point A to point B. I believe gravity manipulation and physics-based gameplay is one of the greatest things gaming has bothered exploring. When done well, it is logical, intuitive and rewarding. It’s like pulling out that second to last piece of Jenga.This is what Defy Gravity Extended is: an extremely satisfying game. You play as Kara, following the Samus school of power armour where you couldn’t tell the gender were it not for the game description. She has to prove herself as a Gravitymancer in the Gauntlet, using her sassy gravity gun (which looks a bit like a Super Soaker). The gun can set two kinds of fields: one that attracts and one that repels. This is the basic premise, and the levels are variations upon previously-set rules. You might encounter enemies who are also affected by the gravity fields, a level may turn your anti-gravity shield permanently on, or you’ll have to use platforms affected by your gravity gun as well.The graphics are really basic, and I admit I was a tad skeptical when I saw some screenshots, but after 5 minutes into the game all my doubts were washed away. The levels are very well-made and reward smart thinking. The first few stages give you hints where to place the respective gravity fields, but you will soon realize that you can use even less resources than recommended.The music is also really good. Now, I’m not a music reviewer and I lack the capacity to translate how music feels using words, but Defy Gravity’s soundtrack took me off-guard in a very pleasant way.The only complaint I can think of is a lack of level editor, which seems extremely appropriate for a game like this.

												Hey! I know most of you already have this game, because it gets so damn cheap, considering the card prices, it even had effectively negative prices in the past.So, this review is not to make you buy this overlooked gem. It is to make you play it.First, who is the targeted audience here? If you liked, Rochard or Outland or any other puzzle platformer, you will feel like at home here. I know most of the reviewers really like using shortcut of, ""Yes, this is puzzle, and the most commonly loved puzzle game around is Portal, so I will just call this Portal in 2d AND space AND gravity guns rather than portal guns AND without an actual story AND heavily amateurish -or indie- AND with some minor bugs making controls a bit harder AND....As you can see if you say this game is similar to some other with some exceptions, but if number of these exceptions are more than 5, actually your so called similarity does not convey any information at all. So, I will just skip calling this ""2D PORTAL game"" even though I agree that it sounds catchy. It is not similar to that game. And btw, if the idea of 2d Portal sounds enticing to you, here is the original Portal game that started it all: http://armorgames.com/play/107/portal-the-flash-versionThis game is a puzzle game. You use a gravity gun whose stationary bullets move you towards it, and another one whose bullets repel you. You also have a shield, causing you not to be affected by those effects. You can just use once for each type, until your feet touches the ground. You use these mechanics, together with momentum to overcome some obstacles, reach some high places which is not obvious how to reach. Levels get progressively harder, introduces some enemies, some hazards, and new tools like free to move platforms, vanishing platforms etc to increase the complexity a bit.I really liked playing through it. The most used ""tactics"" is same for many puzzles, put an attractor, jump to it, put a repeller behind, cancel attractor then you are flying ahead.  Of course there are some others, and even using when to use that changes from puzzle to puzzle, and in the later levels, choosing where to put starting attractor also becomes a part of the question. But still, if this game was longer, it would be prone to become a chore. In current case, it introduces the mechanics, uses them all, tests whether you are really able to use all, and says farewell before giving you a chance to get bored.I have one minor and one more minor negative. First, minor one. Even though I can feel the effort put for attracting and repelling mechanisms, they dont work in a predetermined way. Sometimes you perfectly know what to do, still a milimetrical wrong placement of the ""bullet"" destroys your strategy. Not being able to assign moves from before hand, together with general difficulty of placement of ""bullet""s midfly, helps the feeling of glitchiness. I think there is no glitch here, only some calculations is not smoothed out. Really really really minor mistakes, even the ones that is not visible to the eye can cause to death.More minor one: In the last level, checkpoint placement sucks. I had to read through all of the Credits 50 times before finishing it. For the first 5 times, I thought ""Wow! Such a nice idea to implement credits here!"" Nearing the end, my thought was like this: ""These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are stealing my precious seconds again.""If you can oversee some minor problems with games like these, you will enjoy the effort and thought put here. There is also an extra ""New Game+""like mode, supposedly taking the option of attractors out, but I did not try it, so I cant comment on it. From what I have played though, I know that you will enjoy ""Aha!"" moments, and succeeding ""Finally nailed it"" moments. Not expect a perfect platformer or a hardest puzzle ever though. It is mediocre at both of these.TLDR:=========================if indie_tolerance==0{ignore;end}if indie_tolerance>0 and puzzle_love>0 and platformer_love>0{if cheapskate>0{get;end}else{maybe;end}}			",930,220,17,111,80,9,185

												An interesting platformer that although it may feel a bit cheap, i enjoyed it. Here you have a gun that can create a gravity or anti-gravity field, and you must use that to go through the levels. One thing i liked is that the gun isn't always necessary to progress, making the level design feel more balanced. There's 24 levels, and after that you unlock the hard mode, but either way the game isn't too hard, just challenging a few times. The graphics and music weren't impressive, but they got the job done. One thing i didn't like was the lack of a level select screen: you can only start a new game or continue. But it's a decent game nonetheless, and for cheap is worth of your time.

												The ability to alter gravity in a platformer is nothing new, but using gravity wells to do so is a novel concept that I haven't really seen done- at least, not with player controlled wells. At 24 levels, Defy Gravity is pretty short, but...Despite only having 24 levels, this is one of the most frustrating games I've played in a while. To put it bluntly: the main mechanics don't work right. Sometimes the wells pull you in/push you away as they're supposed to, sometimes nothing happens. Often with the blue wells I found myself looping around the center and dying, simply because the game felt like it. The design of most of the levels, especially near the end demand near perfect control with this utterly broken mechanic.Oh, and your air jump replenishes weirdly, sometimes triggers on the ground (hello, death!), and cuts all horizontal momentum when you jump.Hard mode strips you of the anti-wells and the only way to get any reliability from the mechanics is to use both in conjunction.Literally the only upside to this game is you can buy it, turn around and sell the cards for more money than the game itself. I guess that it's short helps too, but really this is not worth the effort to play through.			",69,23,2,14,4,0,13

												Altering Gravity is nothing new, however altering it with those Gravity Wells is somewhat new, and unexplored.So the concept is great. But you only NEED to use the Wells in the last few levels, the rest is almost completely possible without them.Another big issue I had was the limit of the Wells. You can only have to Wells at a time, with one being normal-, and the other anti-gravity. They don't have a timelimit so that's nice, but I would much rather have unlimited Wells with a timelimit than two infinite Wells.But it's only one dollar, so if you feel like playing a little platformer pick this up.

												This game requires good forward thinking, great hand-to-eye coordination and an unearthly amount of patience to beat, especially if you want to get all the achievements.The use of gravity wells to adjust your jumps is the gimmick in this game, it is implemented to the core style of play and you’ll find yourself using it pretty much for all kinds of situations. Thankfully, the mechanics are very easy to learn, though it will take more than a few tries for the trial and errors to take hold in experience.There are 24 levels in total, you can expect to die countless times on laser traps, football-like projectiles, collapsible platforms, shuriken shooting bots, moving walls of doom and the classic never-ending pits of doom. It won’t be unfair to call this game brutal, but you’ll have unlimited continues in your disposal, along with a save point practically after every trap.The length of this game will vary depending on how good you are at it, a speed runner can do this in 20 minutes, a good player may get away with 2 hours, it took me around 12 hours to complete it entirely along with the hard mode.If you are someone who likes a real challenge, get this. If you’re a casual gamer who can’t take setbacks very well, please avoid it like the plague.			",519,140,15,40,27,10,55

												Although very simple, it's really addicting due its difficulty, but, most of this difficult, is just finding out the trick of each stage and their sections. The faults of the game that gets irritating are when, sometimes, the blue vortex fail to grab the character, or sometimes expel, and the other is the jump/jetpack, sometimes it doesnt work and sometimes activate right after jumping, killing the momentum. I managed to finish the game in the Hard Mode, and not because of that, I recommend, it's really worth a try.			",137,7,15,4,16,0,5

												Defy Gravity is a fairly minimalist 2D platformer. The game’s controls are very simple:•	You can jump.•	You can double jump in the air (with a cooldown between aerial jumps – but it is possible to jump more than once if you spend enough time in the air, such as if you’re in a gravity well).•	You can create a gravity well which sucks you (and gravity-sensitive objects) towards it. You can create one of these at a time, and have two shots before you need to touch the ground again.•	You can create an anti-gravity well which repels you (and gravity sensitive objects) away from it. You can create one of these at a time, and have two shots before you need to touch the ground again.•	You have a shield you can activate which prevents you from being affected by gravity (and in some levels, it is always on).The core gameplay mechanics are decent enough – the game has a very minimalist set of elements (platforms you can jump through (some of which move on their own, some of which fall down a few seconds after landing on them), enemies you can jump on top of to kill them and jump again, enemies you can’t bounce off of, and an enemy that kills you if you touch it which shoots other enemies which kill you if you touch them, and ground that kills you if you touch it). Everything in the game moves in linear, predictable paths. Some enemies can be affected by gravity wells (signified by them being gold-colored), others can’t (signified by them being gray); the same applies to the platforms.At its core, the game presents about an hour and a half of puzzles with these mechanics, and it is simple enough; it gets progressively more difficult the further you get into the game, and the last few levels are quite difficult. The game is mostly pretty generous with checkpoints, but the second to last level requires you to get through fairly long puzzles without screwing up.Once you beat the game, the game puts you back at the start in hard mode, in which you no longer have anti-gravity wells and all enemies are affected by gravity, which makes the game significantly more difficult. But the levels are the same as they were before, though I think there might be a few modifications to make it possible to solve some of the puzzles which require too many gravity well shots to solve otherwise.In any case, this core gameplay is decent enough, and while the game is quite short (about 90 minutes to beat the regular mode), it is probably about as long as it wants to be.The real weakness of this game is the fact that there is really nothing else here. The game is extremely simplistic, the graphics are clean and clear but pretty lackluster and not particularly pretty to look at, there is no story, and the levels feel clearly designed to be challenges without actually even bothering to feel organic in any way (which, ironically, may actually make sense, as the premise of the game is that you’re in there to… complete challenges…).Anyway, while this game has a fairly decent score on Metacritic, that is likely because, quite frankly, there’s not much to criticize here. But there’s not much to like, either; this game is extremely forgettable and I feel like I’m going to forget it within a very short period of time. The game never wows you, and that makes it hard to really love it or even care particularly much about it.All in all, this isn’t bad. But you can probably find a better use for an hour and a half (or three hours, if you really want to beat the hard mode and get 100% achievements) of your life. This game is simply unremarkable.

												I enjoyed this game because it's a very portal-esque platformer, except that it's much, much, much easier to die in this game than it is in Portal. In fact, dying is a good 70-90% of what you will do.Basically you play as a gravity-mancer, which is a person who uses a gravity gun to create bubbles of gravity and antigravity. With these bubbles, you will redirect yourself, platforms, enemies, and platform-enemies to try to survive a series of increasingly difficult puzzles. This game requires as much skill in execution as problem-solving, and is more fun to play than most $15 platformers out there with better graphics. On top of all that, it's cheap. If you like puzzles, platforming and difficulty, you should definitely buy this game.			",167,55,3,33,1,1,6

												Defy Gravity is a tiny little physics-based puzzle platformer in which you manipulate your movement through the creation of gravity and anti-gravity wells, allowing you to conquer assorted obstacles. Almost everything about the game is somewhat reminiscent of the big days of browser-based flash games. Fairly generic music loops, non-existent story, simplistic art style, and a pretty short length compared to most games on Steam (30-60 minutes for a basic playthrough, or 90-120 minutes if you're including all achievements/hard mode). The concept's not too bad, but the puzzle design is somewhat repetitive and the difficulty progression is very uneven (the final supposed-to-be-climactic puzzle is actually one of the easiest rooms in the game).Overall, there are plenty of worse ways to spend an hour or so. Defy Gravity is definitely worth the summer sale price of $0.29 - especially considering it comes with Steam Trading Cards which you can easily sell back for more than that. At full price, however, the cost is a bit steep for the paltry amount of content here. Grab it if it's on sale and you have a huge fetish for physics puzzles, or not at all.			",125,19,2,7,6,1,14

												+ Challenging, but fair puzzles+ Good music+ Charming- Short- The second half of the game is a copy of the first half, the difference being that you don't have access to one of your 2 powers.- Very basic sprite-based graphicsThis is an extremely charming game. It's a physics based platformer. The reason why it's so cheap is because it's a fairly short game (I have 100% on it, and I haven't been playing offline). You play as a sprite with the ability to shoot physics altering gravity and anti-gravity ""wells"". Think 2D Portal in which portals don't teleport you, they attract or repulse matter (including you). Apart from that theres a Bullet Bill jumping element to some puzzles, but imagine being able to influence their trajectory by shooting a well in the vicinity.Now, you gotta understand that Defy Gravity hasn't been made to look outstanding. I don't know what it is about it, but I can tell the devs were doing this out of love for making a game.Props to the music, it really clicks in with the puzzling around. There's no other notable sounds, the gun shooting is adequate.Graphics-wise... well its a 2D sprite game. It's also very blocky, and I do regret the dev's choice of font for the menus, but this is me nitpicking.The only true flaw this game has is how short it is. It's 24 levels with a hard mode for one more playthrough. It's arguably 48 levels long, but the difference between one half and the other is that you need to approach problems from a different perspective. A shame there is no climax to the game - it just abruptly ends.I say it's worth the price. I mean come on, it's the price of a cookie. Develop your brain instead of acquiring calories ;p. Just be sure that you're fine with dying a lot to find the solution. Don't worry though for the longer levels - there are frequent checkpoints (in my opinion too frequent).

												This game is different for all other platformers. The leavels gets extremely hard near the end and invole dieing lots of times before completing the leavel. This game is greet fun to play and definitely worth buying especially as it's so cheap.			",51,4,1,2,3,0,5

												Defy gravity is an indie puzzle/platform game that deserves more recognition. It has its own unique puzzle mechanic. You control two gravity portals that either pull you towards or repels you away to help you solve challenging and engaging puzzles. The game is $2.99 USD at the price for all that you're getting it's a freaking steal. If you liked portal I would pick up this indie game.

												Now this is a fun little game.  I don't think I've played any others quite like it.  With a clever use of gravity wells and repulsion wells, getting around these puzzles allows for multiple fun solutions.  Now, the game gets super difficult really fast. However, the controls and physics are so tight that when you master certain techniques, you feel like a real badass pulling them off.			",163,33,4,9,11,1,21

												+ Challenging, but fair puzzles+ Good music+ Charming- Short- The second half of the game is a copy of the first half, the difference being that you don't have access to one of your 2 powers.- Very basic sprite-based graphicsThis is an extremely charming game. It's a physics based platformer. The reason why it's so cheap is because it's a fairly short game (I have 100% on it, and I haven't been playing offline). You play as a sprite with the ability to shoot physics altering gravity and anti-gravity ""wells"". Think 2D Portal in which portals don't teleport you, they attract or repulse matter (including you). Apart from that theres a Bullet Bill jumping element to some puzzles, but imagine being able to influence their trajectory by shooting a well in the vicinity.Now, you gotta understand that Defy Gravity hasn't been made to look outstanding. I don't know what it is about it, but I can tell the devs were doing this out of love for making a game.Props to the music, it really clicks in with the puzzling around.

												This is a clever take on the platforming genre.You are a space man who can ""fire"" two kinds of level changing shots.  Either an area of gravity that will pull everything, including you, towards it, or an area of anti-gravity, that will push everything, including you, away from it.  You also can toggle on and off a gravity shield that makes you immune to your own and any naturally occuring gravity fields.  Also, you can only have two of any kind of gravity field up at a time, and you have keys to destroy them?Sound like a lot?For me it was a little clunky to ever be intuitive to play.  However, the challenge of figuring out each level was still interesting.  The music and art was not fantastic, but it wasn't terrible either.  There were also not many options to adjust the experience.Still, I appreciate the unique mechanics and what they are trying to do here.  Someone who likes platform games would probably enjoy this more than me.6/10			",36,5,1,4,0,0,8

												A 2D version of portal, with a little twist that really makes the game unique, not just another copy. Just a tiny tip : If you can't control your rage, I am not going to buy you new keyboards,mouses or controlers, got it ? coolGraphics - If you are not a sucker for great looking games, then you should have no problem with what this game has to offer, graphic wise. It has a rather strange style, by using textures from retro games and giving them a twist from textures from newer games, you get this, a strange looking game 7/10Music - The games strongest point, great choice by the Devs to put in calm and relaxing songs, while you are being irritated by dying at least a 100 times on a single level, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LEVEL 9/10Story - You can't say this game does not a have a story, yes it is pretty small, but it still does. Like many games, you are the chosen but first you have to prove yourself by going through a variety of (let's call it chambers) till you get to the end. Just to be suprised that you have finished nothing, you just unlocked hard mode. OMAHGOD 6/10Content - Hmm, well 2-3 variations of enemies,  a lot of rooms (chambers) to pass, get's even more difficult the more you advance, but hey an interactive selection menu. 5/10Controls - Rather stiff movement, now you will say (but hey he is in a space suit, he is confined to certain movements), to which I will respond with (well in some games people wear armors that cover their whole bodies and they are still more maneuverable than he is). Plays almost the same on a keyboard+mouse or controler setup. 5/10Gameplay - The game runs at a normal rate, nothing too fast or too slow, you can have as much time as you want to think how you are going to do the certain challenge or how you would like to approach it. 7/10Overall the game is a fun time killer, for a few hours or like me for probably a few days, GODDAMMIT, either you are going pass it with no casualties or with, have fun xD   Overall score: 6.5/10			",143,38,8,29,12,2,24

Music is very nice with an atmospheric tone to it as well as the sound design. Honestly I sucked for the most part with this game so I ended up skipping through a bunch of levels even on hard mode lol.

												A decent game. You play as an astronaut basically, and you have the ability to create and destroy gravity fields at will. Gravity fields that either pull you in or push you out.With that ability you have to navigate through very tricky levels involving lasers, moving platforms and various other obstacles. It's a bit low on the visual side however it makes up for that with the gameplay. It's extremely difficult to master and the levels are very very challenging. I'm a huge Super Meatboy Fan (even finished the Cotton Alley on A+) and I would say this is harder than meatboy.I recommend this game if you are looking for a challenge at a low price. It's interesting, it's difficult, and it will make you cry... It will probably also make you regret your decision to buy it and actually try to finish it because of how challenging it is.Give it a try :)			",420,129,7,33,29,7,46

												Defy Gravity Extended is an...uh...extended version of what was originally an Xbox Live Indie Game. I forget exactly what's different about this edition, aside from being a fair bit longer. Still, this is a game that can completed twice in about two hours (if you're going for all of the achievements).Everyone buys this game for the cards right? After all, this is one of those games that can be had for so cheap, players will profit just by owning it. While it's tempting to turn on idlemaster and do something else, IMO this is a game that is actually worth playing. The concept is interesting, the mechanics/controls are solid, and there's a fair amount of challenge to keep things engaging. The pleasant low-key soundtrack rounds everything out nicely. Defy Gravity Extended a pretty short game, so it didn't give me many opportunities to find things to complain about. Actually, I suppose the hit-box is a little too big, but the checkpoints are generous enough so it's not really a huge issue.Give it a go sometime.			",914,265,35,107,34,4,37

												Well, what can I say, sunk a total of three hours into this and all three were completely gratifying, you basically play an astronaut thas can push/pull himself through a myriad of obstacles using either gravity or anti-gravity portals you fire around you to gain advantage and pass to the next level, it has a very net yaroze feel I greatly enjoyed.Obviously, there are a few minor imperfections and if I'm to outline them briefly they'd outline the players ability to perform almost an infinite amount of double jumps in the air which makes a majority of these levels a breeze, there were only two real moments I felt a slight urge to rage quit and no doubt you'll experience them too, but I reccomend you push on through to the best of your abilities.The game is a great little time passer with moderate graphics, gameplay and music, definitley worth the eighteen pence I spent on it and brightened up my Saturday, my biggest dissapoinment which I'll hide behind a spoiler tag was that  once you've beaten the game you're introduced to the idea of a 'hard' mode, sadly, I found this much easier than the normal mode and some of the level recycling felt like a cheap, albeit enjoyable way to extend the game another hour and a half, though some will definitley lose their patience with the heavy trial and error segments of the game.Game on.

												--------------- Defy Gravity  ---------------        Defy Gravitiy is a 2D sidescroller puzzle game. The player takes on the roll of a Gravitymancer who uses a tool (similar to the portal gun from ""Portal"" which can fire a matter which pushes away objects or pulls them in) to overcome obstacles to reach the goal. The game isn't very long, but can be challenging. Once you do finish the game you'll be presented with the opportunity to replay it on a higher difficulty.______________________________________________________________      The game is ridiculously and worth buying. I'm sure your money will not be wasted. It also includes trading cards and achievements.			",153,30,0,20,10,0,18

												Defy Gravity is a fantastic platformer with great gameplay elements. This platformer utilizes gravity as the main mechanic. The player can create gravity and anti-gravity pockets to proceed through the levels. I would say that it has a similar difficulty curve as found within Portal, but it lacks story elements. Being a platfomer, however, it doesn’t require story elements, just quality controls. Graphically, it’s lacking, but having solid controls is what makes this game fantastic. This game also has a “Hard Mode”, which requires you to only use gravity pockets, and the enemies are affected by the gravity. This “Hard Mode” extends the gameplay you will find within Defy Gravity, but it doesn’t come off as too forceful. The only real reason to play through “Hard Mode” is to get all of the achievements. I will recommend this game to anyone looking for a new affordable experience.			",384,110,15,42,40,6,41

												Neat idea, but badly executed. Simple and repetitive graphics aside, the controls are wonky and don't feel right. Your character doesn't follow your cursor very quickly, and double-jumping robs you of all forward momentum for some reason. Most of the game's difficulty is caused by the counter-intuitive controls, and as soon as you get used to them the game is over in just a couple of hours.			",90,14,1,3,11,0,11

												I bought this game just to see if a credit card worked.My sister's jeep broke down in a pretty big way, and we needed a credit card to be able to rent a car while her jeep was being fixed. We scrambled all across the house and dug through everything multiple times, with things going less and less right as the day went on, and her losing her patience with everything very rapidly.Then I found it. An old card.Problem was, it might've been a card that she thought she lost a couple years ago, and thus had shut down. She decided that the way to see if this would work, would be to buy a cheap set of note cards or something off Amazon, since she uses those for school. Amazon had different ideas, however, and wouldn't provide a checkout button. We were stumped, as we were both pretty sure that Amazon didn't have a minimum price limit, since it's not like they eat the shipping charge.Then she remembered Steam was a thing.We went over to my computer, and I searched for the cheapest game right now, which happened to be this game for a measly 14 cents. Without even looking at anything about it, I threw it into my cart and checked out. The suspense built as Steam processed the card. And then payment went through.We joked about how this game would be the worst game ever, and looked at the store page to see a very XBLIG-looking game. I booted it up, and played it just a tiny bit...And it was actually a legitimately good game. The graphics aren't exactly pushing my PC to its limits, but it's a fun little game centered around gravity manipulation, and I've spent more on worse. After playing it for a bit, I noticed the game was made by the people making Road Redemption, which is a game I actually really want.All in all, I'd reccomend this game to people looking for fun little puzzle platformers, or people who need to test out their credit cards quickly. Thank you, Fish Factory Games, for letting my sister rent cars with confidence.			",476,59,5,62,32,1,38

												Okay, so sure, the game might not be the -prettiest-,  but oh my does it make up for it in gameplay! I completed it in 0.9 hours...and unlocked Hard Mode. And it is just the perfect follow-up to the normal game... because by that point, you've become the master... and it explains how you no longer have anti-wells, and you think ""Oh dear this WILL be hard!"" And then you eventually master THAT, and then a level comes along that wipes that off the board...In summary, a challenging but VERY satisfying puzzle game with a perfectly executed...gimmick thing.Gravity!And this may be the only game I get 100% of achievements... and only for £0.09! (If it weren't for sales, I never woulda seen this!)VERY RECOMMENDED			",228,39,3,25,33,1,33

												As of where I'm at now I haven't finished the game and can't offer a complete review. I can, however, offer a few comments on what I've already seen. This is an intriguing puzzle game with a unique weapon that has two main functions. Choosing to either draw or push things around the well will influence your character enough to navigate the level. There is no maze function, though there are many twists and turnsThe point and click functions well with the controls and there is a level of versatility offered as many keys have the same function. My only true complaint about the game is the camera view. You can shoot outside of your line of sight (which you are often encouraged to do in later levels) and yet you can't see where you're aiming. There are the suggestive little circles around it to promote the shot, so of course the developers intended for you to aim there. Unnecessary deaths aren't always fun.Anyhow, this game is definitely worth the money I paid (it was 90% off when I bought it.) That's just $0.29. Who wouldn't want it? Even at full price I'd definitely recommend this game.			",52,16,0,12,12,0,5

												Defy Gravity is a very cool puzzle game where you use a gravity gun to either attract or repel yourself along each level. As the levels progress, new obstacles are presented and things become tougher. It is a very challenging game and some of the later levels look downright impossible. However, i was able to complete them all, even all the levels in hard mode. Sure it gets frustrating, but the checkpoint system is very forgiving. I had to lower my 2560x1440 display to 1920x1080 in order to get this to run full screen.Pros-Cheap price-Challenging gameplay-Smooth framerate-Extremely stable. Never crashed on me. I use Windows 8.1-Great mechanics-Good music (does repeat quite a bit but the songs never get old)Cons-Doesn't run full screen in 2560x1440-Not able to change key bindings. The ""W"" key is also jump and messed me up many times when i accidentally hit it. I picked this up for 29 cents. You can't beat that. Even the full price of 2.99 is good if you enjoy puzzle games that challenge you. 8/10 Very good. Great deal!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As with many of the people here, I bought the game during the steam summer sale for 18p. I wasn't expecting much from it, anything better than being completely and utterly broken would be nice.Defy Gravity is actually a basic but pretty good platformer with an overarcing mechanic, making 'gravity wells' that either attract or repulse you. It's difficult, but not difficult enough to get you over annoyed, always a hard balance to get in a platformer. The only real problem is the graphics, which aren't the greatest, but serviceable. Soundtrack's half-decent as well. Sold the trading cards for 22p, so made a profit from it.Overall, a cheap and cheerful indie game that can currently be bought for next to nothing. Worth it at the (admittedly low) full price.			",189,33,15,12,32,4,50

												Defy Gravity Extended is an interesting game, to say the least.  I got it on sale for $0.29 and it was worth every penny (especially since I sold the trading cards for $0.37 :PI would highly reccommend this game.  The difficulty is quite high, but extremely frequent save points prevent replaying the same thing over and over.  Although the animation and graphics quality are not the best, they serve their purpose and don't really take anything from the game.  The replayability is not very high, but I got 10 hours playing through normal and turbo mode once.Overall, I would rate it a 9.32/10.  Exactly 9.32/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are reading this on when the steam sales are still in, OMG, go and get this one and fast. You can see from the hour count it is not very long game, as I have beaten it once or even twice, can't realy remember... but that's the only downside of it - that it cant go any longer than it is!It is an Indie-2 dimensional puzzle game, very fun and relaxing yet not boring almost at any point. The story line - is not super evolved, as it is, a puzzle game. there is a small background explanation of the 'events' leading the player into the puzzle series, simple enough to make sense.The soundtrack - Unbelievably amazing. In fact, i haven't played this game for more than a few months now, and the reason i'm writing this is that i got on a loop of movies & video games OST, suddenly got back to the soundtrack of this game and remembered the fond memories i have from the music escorting me through the game levels as the get harder and harder. The tracks are neat, chill and relaxing and very fun to listen even outside the game. I'm almost sure i can speak for many when I say that the music is an undivided part of the actual gameplay.The Puzzles/levels - Very fun, despite the fact this game doesn't have crazy graphics. As I discovered, all you need is some obstacles and a nice gravity-controlling device to keep you grounded to the screen for 2-3 hours straight. Overall opinion: a good way of having fun in a relaxing puzzle environment, listening to good music and just taking a break from life. if you have some 'change' left on your steam wallet from big purchases and you're looking for something refreshing definitely go for this gem.

												An original and 'fun-to-play-for-a-while' puzzler! I have finished it twice to gain the last achievement for this game. A little repetitive because in Hard Mode there weren't that much differences (mostly the lack of anti-gravity production and the fact that all enemies/obstacles now react on gravity and come towards you). I only played it twice because I was in for a challenge and it became challenging at times. I'd say this game is nice for a brain training :) Recommended, even for the current price!

												I didnt even knew this game before someone told me it was on sale, becoming the cheapest game on steam.I bought it for the steam cards, but i found a great game, despite the simplistic visuals and sounds.The gameplay is where it's at! Its a 2D Platformer / Puzzle, where everything revolves around Gravity, being able tocreate gravity fields and anti gravity fields to attract or repel the character (repel = rocket jumps! true story)Its highly addictive, and gets pretty hard towards the end, but is a very short game.Even with hard mode (with no antigravity available), completing it twice only took me 5 hours.Then again, with its current price tag, its definitely more bang for your buck!Give Defy Gravity a try.

												Nice little puzzle game going with the theme of physics based utility guns. In Defy Gravity this gun is a device that creates gravity and anti-gravity fields. Player can also issue a shield against these special fields, which renders him (her?) immune to the fields but not the ""ordinary"" gravity. Strangely enough, some objects (it turns out they're the yellow ones) are affected by the fields while none of the others are.This makes for adequate puzzles: in any level you have to reach the end, while juggling between platforms and deadly blades. Dying is not a big issue: you'll respawn at a close-by platform and can continue right away. However, there are a couple of rather difficult spots, that might turn to be frustrating to get past.Then again the game is rather short. In mere 2.5 hours I completed both the base game and the hardmode that comes after, has more difficult levels and slightly different rules.If you like punishing puzzle platformers like Super Meat Boy or Adventures of Shuggy, this game is a nice snack (it even costs almost nothing). Musics are nice, and while there's no actual story, you will probably find it fun to be one of the universe's magnificent ""gravitomancers"".Regretfully, I encountered a couple of bad bugs along the way. First, the game freezes if you try to start a new game without having Windows Media Player installed. So, you have two options: install that or disable music (by -nomusic command line option). Another one was even more annoying: apparently some video cards (ATI Radeons) have a bug that the screen black-outs every once in a while. Very annoying issue. It would have been game-breaking, but it turns out at least I could work around it by doing double jumps (jumping in the air... so yeah) or going to Steam Overlay, both that repaint the screen. It does seem that the developers are looking into the issue, so hopefully it'll be fixed sometime in the future. It turns out the game was entirely completable and enjoyable despite these bugs though.			",3011,1260,77,374,381,26,452

												Defy Gravity is a platformer. You might say puzzle platformer, but I’d just call it a challenging platformer in the vein of Super Meat Boy or Blood of the Werewolf, though Defy Gravity isn’t quite that infuriatingly difficult as those two. The gameplay was challenging enough to be rewarding but easy enough to be fun, I thought it was a good mix. The checkpoints were much better as well, being more frequent. If you die, you basically just start right before the last little challenge. Levels are fairly short. I think with SMB you have to start at the beginning of the level and BotW there are checkpoints but they can be pretty long at times. This game doesn’t really have any enemies either, besides some orbs, spiky orbs, and some sort of ships that shoot missiles or whatever. I don’t really remember about SMB, but BotW had more traditional enemies and super bosses. This didn’t have any of that. Mostly you are avoiding friggin laser beams on the floor or wall or ceiling. Sometimes you had to ride a platform through the level. The way it all works is that you have a duel gravity gun. You can shoot attractive gravity and reflective gravity. Attractive obviously pulls you toward it, so you can jump, shoot that and get sucked to it and then dispel it as you approach it to give you a little jump bust. Reflective will bounce you away, like a rocket jump. You have a double jump in the air. Pretty simple. You hold the LMB or RMB until you want it to stop, aim with the mouse. Movement with A/D. I don’t think a controller would help the controls, but they didn’t work bad. I think Q dispelled the attractive gravity, though it didn’t seem I could dispel reflective. Shift put up a gravity shield so they didn’t affect you. Sometimes a level would shoot it’s own gravity wells. The more challenging levels were when you had to ride the platform, which was propelled by your gravity gun, and also avoid everything else. Problem was that the platform would continue through walls if you weren’t careful, whereas you would not. Challenging. Presentation was pretty mediocre/cheap. It didn’t look BAD, but it was far from a pretty game too. I would recommend the game for people that like this type of game, especially for the price. It’s normally only 2$, which isn’t bad at all and it frequently goes on sale for like 90% off. I don’t mind it, but it’s not my favorite by far. So I played until I had the first three achievements (38%) for progress and then quit. I think it was about a half hour. There was no indication of what level I was on or how many there are total. Which is annoying as you don’t know how long the game is going to be. Though I suppose most games are that way, huh? ",631,244,17,61,52,12,65

												For such a cheap and simple game, it's a fun game. I originally got it because it was less than a dollar and it had steam cards, but the time I played it for steam cards, I really enjoyed it. It's a bit different from other puzzle games if you'd call it a puzzle game. There are times you have to act fast and if you don't, you will find yourself falling towards the ground and then you'll have to start back at the last checkpoint. It can take a little practice, but it pays off.In the end, it's a game that for its price is quite satisfying and worth buying if you have the spare change.			",241,36,21,16,15,4,24

I don’t think a controller would help the controls, but they didn’t work bad. I think Q dispelled the attractive gravity, though it didn’t seem I could dispel reflective. Shift put up a gravity shield so they didn’t affect you. Sometimes a level would shoot it’s own gravity wells. The more challenging levels were when you had to ride the platform, which was propelled by your gravity gun, and also avoid everything else. Problem was that the platform would continue through walls if you weren’t careful, whereas you would not. Challenging. Presentation was pretty mediocre/cheap. It didn’t look BAD, but it was far from a pretty game too. I would recommend the game for people that like this type of game, especially for the price. It’s normally only 2$, which isn’t bad at all and it frequently goes on sale for like 90% off. I don’t mind it, but it’s not my favorite by far. So I played until I had the first three achievements (38%) for progress and then quit. I think it was about a half hour. There was no indication of what level I was on or how many there are total. Which is annoying as you don’t know how long the game is going to be. Though I suppose most games are that way, huh? ",631,244,17,61,52,12,65

												""Defy Gravity"" is a decent puzzle platformer with rather simple graphics but good controls.To complete the levels, you use your gun to create gravity or anti-gravity fields, pulling/pushing you and/or objects like balls, sawblades and small platforms.The gameplay is quite refreshing for such a small indie game, difficulty is well balanced with the learning curve and the hard mode you unlock after completing the game gives an extra challenge by completely deactivating the anti-gravity function of your gun for another playthrough.Even though the game is very short, I highly recommend to get it, especially at a reduced price.

												Lots of players are buying this game because of the low price - at sales usually it hits -90%, meaning that you'll probably profit from it's cards.But about the game itself: it's a good one. You control an astronaut (?) who has a special tool/weapon at his service: it can shoot two kinds of energy cores: one attracts things near itself, the another one repels. Sounds really basic, but the level design is really good, some levels require thinking and puzzle-solving skill, while other ones are more like  based on timing- and aiming.I can wholeheartedly recommend this game, if you don't mind the simple graphics, it's a really well-executed puzzler-platformer game with medium-high difficulty.

												As someone who's played a fair share of platformers and puzzlers and has pretty defined opinions about design and what ""difficulty"" entails, this game started out as decently fun and interesting. I enjoyed the music, and the title screen background art got my expectations comfortably high. But quickly, it feels like the game runs out of ideas for level design using the gravity gimmick. It starts to feel like a mediocre free Flash browser game - long segments of jumping on a slow stream of orb enemies, repeated ""use gravity to drag this platform around"" bits, and a lot of areas where the solution to the puzzle is to simply use the same bruteforce technique a few times, because the inconsistent physics will net you a win. Some of the puzzles that brag difficulty turn out to be boring - you have to place a grav/anti well at a very precise point that you won't realize is wrong until a full 10 seconds pass, so you try just a little bit to the right, etc. A browser Flash puzzle platformer game is the best comparison really, because of the inconsistent physics and drawn out level design characteristic of them. And the ""ultimate challenge,"" which is the game's sort of newgame+ hardmode, serves to limit your options to make levels feel even less creative to pass by removing anti-grav wells, and makes all enemies physics-based, allowing the often shoddy engine to make your play even less consistent than your first run. Ultimately, I gave up on that because I was bored, not challenged. Games like La-Mulana will leave you feeling challenged by the puzzles and platforming. Or, perhaps this game will as well. A lot of people seem to like the game, but I would have been bored of it if it were freeware. A lot of positivity about this game seems to repeatedly refer to the price point. A game at a comparably low price point which I will recommend in Defy Gravity's stead is Super Hexagon, a challenging game that tests skill rather than the sheer snoring patience required of Defy Gravity. Or maybe I'm wrong and don't know♥♥♥♥♥♥about video games.			",104,6,1,7,6,2,5

												This review is for the game ''Defy Gravity Extended'',a video game developed and published by Fish Factory Games on July 25,2011 for the Xbox 360 and PC.The game is a puzzle platformer with action elements and the theme is Sci-fi.GameplayAs mentioned Defy gravity is a puzzle platformer where the player has to use his gravity and anti-gravity gun in order to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles for the level to clear.By using the gravity gun,obviously,the player can create small bubbles of gravity that can pull into orbit objects and the gravitymancer and by using the anti-gravity gun the gravitymancer can levitate him or push other objects nearby away.Using the guns is pretty simple but mastering them is pretty hardcore.And when you've finally finished the game after hours and hours of dying you realise that was just the normal mode.In Hard mode you can only use the gravity gun and all objects are gravity sensitive.RecapThe game is worth it's money.It can be really frustrating since you will be dying all the time but when you finish the game it leaves you with a great sense of fulfillment and most importantly patience and persistence.P.S Thank you Fish Factory Games developers and associates for this game.

												The animations in this game are at most decent. It's rather easy for platformer game and it doesn't have anything that could surprise fans of this genre... but while I was playing Defy Gravity Extended I had a nostalgia attack. It really remind me of few really old, mostly pre 2000, simple games. I remembered all of good times I spent playing those simple, shareware or freeware, games - without fancy graphics, with short but enjoyable music, focusing only on gameplay not some story. And it was really fun. When it's on sale, it's really cheap - you will be able to get most of your money back from selling cards. I was really surprised by this game and it should be at least tried by everyone, since you spend very little money on it and it can truly bring you few hours of fun.			",1736,715,60,244,224,20,321

												Well what to say. I picked this game up on sale for 32 cents, not expecting a whole lot from it. Thought it might give me 30 minutes of fun, and that's it. I was wrong. This game has a stellar soundtrack, simple graphics, and the game mechanics work in a way that isn't to confusing and is enjoyable to play. Some puzzles you'll complete in 30 seconds, while others may take you 10 to 15 minutes. I absolutley LOVE this game, it totally surprised me. I highly suggest getting this game, even without the sale price.			",165,11,0,12,18,1,4

												First let me make one thing clear. I hate platform games, I'm rubbish at them and they drive me up the wall.Now we have that out the way. I paid £0.09 for this in the 2014 Christmas sale, buying it as many did for the trading cards which were worth more than the game itself. I expected to leave the game running in the background for the cards and that I would be done with it.Well, actualy no. As it turns out this is a good game. Yes it is a platformer and yes it did drive me mad at points. The game while not easy is asscessable for those not of the platform minded. When you die you rarely have to restart that far away from death and the nature of the game with your gravity gun the is rarely need for pin point jumping and landing. No timers, no lives limit, no scoreboards with the simple goal of reaching the end of each level to reach the next.Played for 30-40mins completed about a 1/3rd of the game, 2 or 3 parts = many, many deaths that took a few mins to get right. Other than that an enjoyable plesant suprise.Graphics = Circa late 90sMusic = InoffensiveSFX = Not the bestControls = GoodTutorial = GoodValue = Exceptional@ the current price of £0.09 anyone and everyone regardless of there prefered game genres should buy this game without hesitation.

												Short little game but cheap and I'd say worth its price. The gravity mechanics work well and the level design does plenty with them. I'd contest a few of the design choices (especially the second-to-last level which somehow manages to get EASIER or hard mode =.=; ) but overall it's a fair challenge without ever being overly frustrating. It's not really much about the puzzles as much as manuevering around and you're given a variety of ways to deal with scenarios instead of being stuck trying to figure out the one thing to do, which is what makes it pretty fun to play. The hard mode also rather well changes how the game is played and I didn't mind playing through all the levels again for it. Probably a fair purchase at full price and a really good deal on sale.

												To defy gravity means to not have gravity apply to the person.You could defy gravity in space although there is no gravity besides the gravity pulling you closer to the sun at a very slow rate. But other than that one main pull of gravity in space there is no gravity. Defying gravity therefore would be physically impossible without the help of external sources, such as airplane, jetpack, rocketship. If you were to defy gravity you would need to be able to bend Earth at it's will, deforming it's surface, messing with it's gravitational field, and messing with weather consistency.In the end it is physically impossible to defy gravity therefore meaning that this game is a hoax.

												Overwiew:Fun, cheap, and a cool concept you can't let down.The Pros:Awesome concept.Most of the time, if not always, on sale.Amazing soundtrack.Very puzzling.(also a con) The Cons: Can be frustrating. Levels are hard sometimes.Graphics are too simple. (if you don't like 2D games)Animations are almost nonexistent.Very puzzling.(also a pro)IN CONCLUSION:I'm very neutral about this game. It's cool, relaxing, but also has a fair share of cons.Honestly, I recommend it, but don't buy it unless it's on sale. It's not worth $2.I got it for 29c and didn't expect much, but it did and does amaze.TO SUM IT UP___________|Concept|Rating||Music     .|Great.||Design   .|Eh     .||Puzzling?|Very . ||Fun?      .|Very  .||Graphics|Bad   .||Animat.. |Bad   .||Price      .|Cheap.|OVERALL:I reccomend it, but it's your decision.

												Defy Gravity. Its a simple enough game. making good use of gravity defying forces to pass through the levels. Its really just as simple as that. Its definitely challenging though as your astronaut isnt the easiest to control. I tried using both Keyboard and mouse & the Xbox gamepad with this one and found that either way, if your control isnt perfect then your gonna have a bad time. Thats not to say the challenge is unfair though. You dont feel cheated for failing here which marks the sign of a game developer that knows what they are doing. The music whilst sounding pretty basic actually helps the ambience of the game aswell. Its nothing to get excited about. it just seems to fit quite well with the kind of game this is. Maybe abit to boring for me but I can definitely see the good sides to this game, and it has alot more going for it then it does against it. At the end of the day, When all is said and done. I'd say for the cheap price its available at, Its not a bad idea if you need something to tide you over for a few hours.			",35,7,0,11,4,0,6

												Oh my god!I have never been this mad, raging and furious in any game I've ever played. I like a challenging game, but this borders on punishing, Often crossing the border of when it's fun to play. Still, it's an interesting concept that I haven't come across before and if you quit for a while and return with a level head you can make it all the way through and the sense of relief when you do is beyond words.

												For the price, it isn't a bad purchase. It was fun to playthrough and some levels were quite challenging. The controls are a bit weird to use, but you get used to it. It's a gravity-based platformer with some nice features like gravity shield and anti-gravity. You control gravity to your advantage and you have to reach the door to the next level in every zones to progress. There's a checkpoint system in place too, so the is less frustating.To be fair, this game isn't the best, so if you have no games to play and are bored, might want to pick this one up.PROs:-Fun.-Easy to get started.-Very cheap.CONs:-Music is repetitive and cannot be muted.-Some levels are just alot harder than others ( at random points in the game, not really in the end. )-Game is completed in 3 hours.-Low quality graphics.

I loved how easy it was to play and how hard the challenges got...took me a few tries but in the end i completed the game 100%the only negative side for me was, how easy the hard mode was9/10(too lazy to spellcheck)			",64,7,2,1,2,0,5

												This is an amazing game that is innovative for its time. Although I did rage most of the time, I came to love it for what it was. For a cheap under $5, this blew me away as it stood out.I also did some vids on it, and they will be out soon!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When i purchase the game it was only 0,19€ and just for that when the game is so cheap you should buy it and you can make a little profit with the trading cards.			",435,250,12,44,38,3,56

												So you're equipped with the Gravity Gun and as Gordon Freeman you must fight as... oh wait, not that kind of game... But you do have a Gravity Gun! With said gun, you must shoot blue and orange swirling vortexs to assist in passing each level in an effort to get cake and/or defeat an egomaniacal AI hell bent on testing, lots of testing, which... oh, wait, no cake or AI but you do have blue and orange swirling vortexes.The game seems fun with a pretty original CORE concept, and I would recommend it to friends, but the moment I read Gravity Gun I thought of Half-Life, obviously, and it's not something that will ever make me think of this game. It's fun, but a little more originality in the game itself would be nice.			",40,4,1,7,5,0,4

												100% the game in 3-4 hours. Pretty short, but if you get it on a sale, it's only a dime + pennies. A mix of platformer and easy puzzles (if you can even call it that)My only real gripe about the game is how you control the gravity orb things. The longer you hold M1, the farther it goes before it stops and activates, which is ok, but when lots of things are flying at you, sometimes you just forget.			",105,46,1,14,11,1,11

												I highly recommend this game. Here are the reasons:I bought it when it was 90 percent off, gained 3 trading cards, sold them, made profit so this game is completely free to playIt offers you a 2 hours of fun, levels are enjoying and getting harder when you are also getting more experience and 2 enjoying hours are really enough for a free to play game in my opinionEarning Steam achievements so fast is a great feeling. It has 8 achievements, i played one and half an hour and earned 7 of them. If you are bored about impossible achievements in games, this game offers you a great achievement progress experienceAfter completing all levels, game offers you a new challenging mode: hard mode, which contains same levels with some restrictionsAll in all, this game offers you a great, enjoying moments, according to its price. ""According to its price"" is the most important part of this review, if this game's price were more than 1 dollar, i would not recommended it.			",61,6,1,1,8,1,6

												Defy Gravity is a decent puzzle platformer. The gravity orbs don't always work as intended and at some places there is a lot of trial & error, but I had fun with this game. However, I stopped my playthrough after 45 minutes (roughly 60%) because the game started annoying me. At this point the game tells you that it becomes harder, and yes - it is, in a specific way. It's not really the level design which becomes more difficult to beat, it's your sanity. There are less checkpoints and they are horribly placed.The passages are not difficult to figure out, the game just reduces itself to trial & error. After each respawn you have to wait up to 10 seconds for the enemies or platforms to move so you can continue. Usually I die and then I think ""Whatever, I'll just try again"". I reached the point where I just Alt + F4 out of the game after the 10th death because the game makes me wait longer than I actually have fun with it. It just feels like a punishment for bad playing which is inappropriate for a game like this. Or it's just really bad level design.At least I had 30 minutes of fun. I bought it for 9 cents and I sold each of the 3 trading cards for 8 cents. The game is worth a try, but don't expect too much.			",633,216,23,81,65,7,90

												Like all platformers games, each game has their own challenge. This is no different. Some stages have easy way out (by going up onto the ceiling(well in the earlier stages anyway). Its pretty fun and I got it on a 95% sale which cost 0.17 cents in SGD, so its very worth it, plus I believe (even though I have not complete the game) all achievements all be unlock when you complete the game, and there's also steam cards for this.In summaryits pretty fun and challenging if you like platformers			",172,51,2,20,20,1,15

												To defy gravity means to not have gravity apply to the person.You could defy gravity in space although there is no gravity besides the gravity pulling you closer to the sun at a very slow rate. But other than that one main pull of gravity in space there is no gravity. Defying gravity therefore would be physically impossible without the help of external sources, such as airplane, jetpack, rocketship. If you were to defy gravity you would need to be able to bend Earth at it's will, deforming it's surface, messing with it's gravitational field, and messing with weather consistency.In the end it is physically impossible to defy gravity therefore meaning that this game is a hoax.

Levels are hard sometimes.Graphics are too simple. (if you don't like 2D games)Animations are almost nonexistent.Very puzzling.(also a pro)IN CONCLUSION:I'm very neutral about this game. It's cool, relaxing, but also has a fair share of cons.Honestly, I recommend it, but don't buy it unless it's on sale. It's not worth $2.I got it for 29c and didn't expect much, but it did and does amaze.TO SUM IT UP___________|Concept|Rating||Music     .|Great.||Design   .|Eh     .||Puzzling?|Very . ||Fun?      .|Very  .||Graphics|Bad   .||Animat.. |Bad   .||Price      .|Cheap.|OVERALL:I reccomend it, but it's your decision.

The music fits so well with each level, whether it is hectic or relaxed. However, there is always a catch. The first few levels were a bit repetitive, but once you get to the harder levels it is not repetitive at all, which I find nice. Overall, I give this game an 8/10. If the developer were to add anything, if there was a ""Defy Gravity 2"", it should be a bit more complex.			",70,10,5,5,21,0,6

												For the price, Defy Gravity has a pretty good level of content and quality. The music in this game really helps to set the atmosphere, allowing players to focus on the challenges ahead of them and making the overall experience more enjoyable. This is by no means a horribly difficult game, but at the same time it's not too easy either. I could easily see this as a game to play with friends, if multiplayer was enabled and I think it would be quite a lot of fun. I bought the game for only 29 cents, and it has proven to definitely be a worthwhile purchase. Even if you don't like it, Defy Gravity isn't an expensive game, so it wouldn't be much of a loss to your walletSo basically, if you're into atmospheric or ambient music, love platformers/puzzlers and are a fan of relatively challenging games, then this is for you.

												Summary: better than Portal.The thing you need to understand about Defy Gravity is not that it is good, play for a few minutes and you will understand that, no what you need to understand is that this is better than the Portal series.It doesn't try to beat you over the head with ""humour"" like Portal. It doesn't try to draw you into an un-funny joke. Instead this gives you puzzles to be solved with platforming and using your gravity gun and quick reflexes. A lot of thought has gone into it, so it will challenge but is beatable; and it was a pleasant joy to play. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well what to say. I picked this game up on sale for 32 cents, not expecting a whole lot from it. Thought it might give me 30 minutes of fun, and that's it. I was wrong. This game has a stellar soundtrack, simple graphics, and the game mechanics work in a way that isn't to confusing and is enjoyable to play. Some puzzles you'll complete in 30 seconds, while others may take you 10 to 15 minutes. I absolutley LOVE this game, it totally surprised me. I highly suggest getting this game, even without the sale price.			",165,11,0,12,18,1,4

												Defy Gravity is an inexpensive and fun gravity-based puzzle platformer. You can fire two kinds of projectiles: a blue bolt that attracts and an orange bolts that repels. The graphics are simple and similar to what you'd find on a flash game site. The physics are actually really good! It's incredibly cheap when on sale and you can make your money back if you get it then.			",159,41,2,15,6,0,4

												So you're equipped with the Gravity Gun and as Gordon Freeman you must fight as... oh wait, not that kind of game... But you do have a Gravity Gun! With said gun, you must shoot blue and orange swirling vortexs to assist in passing each level in an effort to get cake and/or defeat an egomaniacal AI hell bent on testing, lots of testing, which... oh, wait, no cake or AI but you do have blue and orange swirling vortexes.The game seems fun with a pretty original CORE concept, and I would recommend it to friends, but the moment I read Gravity Gun I thought of Half-Life, obviously, and it's not something that will ever make me think of this game. It's fun, but a little more originality in the game itself would be nice.			",40,4,1,7,5,0,4

												Like all platformers games, each game has their own challenge. This is no different. Some stages have easy way out (by going up onto the ceiling(well in the earlier stages anyway). Its pretty fun and I got it on a 95% sale which cost 0.17 cents in SGD, so its very worth it, plus I believe (even though I have not complete the game) all achievements all be unlock when you complete the game, and there's also steam cards for this.In summaryits pretty fun and challenging if you like platformers			",172,51,2,20,20,1,15

												Solid controls and lovely atmospheric music. Single-hit deaths mean lots of repitition to get the timing right, especially larger areas where you only see the puzzles as you move forward. Auto saves as you touch ground again, however, so there is no entire level grinding. The controls and gameplay is like Portal but with a much faster auto-save.			",68,49,0,22,11,0,6

												I got this game off scrap.tf and it is an absoulute bargain. I enjoy it, I enjoy how hard it is, I enjoy how easy it is. I love the simplicity of the graphics. The music fits so well with each level, whether it is hectic or relaxed. However, there is always a catch. The first few levels were a bit repetitive, but once you get to the harder levels it is not repetitive at all, which I find nice. Overall, I give this game an 8/10. If the developer were to add anything, if there was a ""Defy Gravity 2"", it should be a bit more complex.			",70,10,5,5,21,0,6

												Oh my god!I have never been this mad, raging and furious in any game I've ever played. I like a challenging game, but this borders on punishing, Often crossing the border of when it's fun to play. Still, it's an interesting concept that I haven't come across before and if you quit for a while and return with a level head you can make it all the way through and the sense of relief when you do is beyond words. Only pick this up if you're a very calm person and even if you are be prepared that loosing your♥♥♥♥♥♥is part of the process of beating this game.			",323,111,16,29,43,4,72

												Defy Gravity. Its a simple enough game. making good use of gravity defying forces to pass through the levels. Its really just as simple as that. Its definitely challenging though as your astronaut isnt the easiest to control. I tried using both Keyboard and mouse & the Xbox gamepad with this one and found that either way, if your control isnt perfect then your gonna have a bad time. Thats not to say the challenge is unfair though. You dont feel cheated for failing here which marks the sign of a game developer that knows what they are doing. The music whilst sounding pretty basic actually helps the ambience of the game aswell. Its nothing to get excited about. it just seems to fit quite well with the kind of game this is. Maybe abit to boring for me but I can definitely see the good sides to this game, and it has alot more going for it then it does against it. At the end of the day, When all is said and done. I'd say for the cheap price its available at, Its not a bad idea if you need something to tide you over for a few hours.			",35,7,0,11,4,0,6

												This is actually one of the better concepts I've played with in a while, it has one idea and basically just builds a whole set of levels specifically to see all the fun and inventive things you can do with it. Also has a classic/jazz/techno mix soundtrack that suits the atmosphere quite well.In terms of making use of what I assume is a limited budget this does a great job.			",225,60,2,19,27,1,24

												It runs. For sixteen cents, that's pretty good.In all seriousness, the idea of the game isn't bad. It's the execution that leaves a lot to be desired. The game is very basic- the menu is simple with next to no option, there's no story, no context, and the tutorials are just kind of shoehorned in. On top of that, the graphics are rough, the sound design is uninspired, and the controls are really awkward.If you can get it for a dollar or less, it's probably worth a look. For more than that, I wouldn't bother.EDIT: To clarify, no story or context is given in the game itself. There is an opening cinematic.			",266,21,3,28,26,0,39

												Defy gravity is one of those titles that can really (and I mean Really) get you hooked up to your monitor. Not in that classical ""Oh I lost track of my life in this masterpiece of a thing"" way. In fact, if you are that type of gamer, unless you love to get frustrated, this game is most certainly not for you. That said, if you indeed want a game that increases your levels of stress and frustration, and leads you to a path of self destruction, by all means buy the thing.I'm actually writing this review after a short session, in the hope of finding the magnificence of this piece.

												Ok, so whenever a decent looking puzzle game is only $0.29 on Steam you need to buy it.When I purchased Defy Gravity, I said to myself “If it stinks, I’ll just sell the Trading Cards and make a profit”, like everyone seems to be doing these days.  After putting only an hour into this game, I have to say it’s actually worth more than what I paid. The game style and play might not be for everyone but it’s definitely worth a try.  I just love how the color of the gravity/repulsion wells, and the gravity gun itself remind me of Portal.Bottom line... it a great little game.			",61,1,0,6,1,1,7

												Defy Gravity: 2D sidescrolling puzzle shooter.The story isn't really important in this game, and it gets covered in the opening sequence before the menu. Skip past it.Where this game comes into its own is the puzzle design. Using ""wells"" that either attract or repel objects (and only the attractor in hard mode). I found it a bit tricky to get the hang of the rules attached to the gameplay, specifically jump recharging, so here's some advice: Don't hold down the jump button, just tap it when needed.The levels are well designed and provide good challenges, although I did find that the early levels were really easy.I feel that this game requires particularly fine control, so if you wish to get the full experience, I would recommend using a keyboard/mouse instead of a controller (Although with an xbox 360 controller it does work properly).The graphics are not amazing in this game, but they're not bad either. The music in this game is very good, though.As far as bugs and problems go, The screen resolution can only be set by command line arguments, and when played full-screen it didn't fully fill my screen, being surrounded by black bars. Also, *very occasionally*, level elements would not load in properly, prompting the player to need to reload to the last checkpoint.As a puzzle game this is pretty good, and worth  a play, especially at the price it is at.

												Unlike most, I bought this game because it interested me, not because of the trading cards. It's a neat little puzzle platformer where you use gravity and anti-gravity to navigate through tricky space hallways... of DEATH. It's a nice game to play when your bored, and is quite challenging. I wouldn't call it great, but it is definitely good. The visuals are reminiscent of a flash game, the backrounds are kinda cool, the controls are good. Overall very average, performance-wise. However, the music is really great, and perfectly accentuates the loneliness of space.			",187,31,2,34,10,0,14

												Defy Gravity is a perfect example of why you should never sell a game with steam cards for less than the overall cost of the earnt steam cards. If a game is run idle for longer than it is actually actively played, something bad happened.The game is okay. You manipulate gravity. I mean the premise alone was fun to mess around with. Game is ugly though, and slightly glitchy. It sure as hell isn't the WORST 19 cent game steam has offered me.I don't remember why I never finished this game. I think I just tuned out.

												Defy Gravity was a game I was pleasantly suprised by. I picked it up for about $0.20 on a sale, and overall, it's a good game.  The game revolves around the use of a gun that shoots gravity wells, the blue gravity well, which attracts things, and the orange anti-gravity well, which repels things. This is a quite fun concept, and is used quite well. Now, if a gun that shoots one of each orange and blue glowy vaguely round objects to progress through a series of puzzles in some sort of challenge course sounds familiar to you at all, that's probably because it sounds a lot like Portal. However, it is actually quite different from Portal. No puzzle has one specific solution, and feels more of a skill-based platformer than a puzzle game. The puzzles are fairly loosely designed, so you can solve them in your own particular style. The game also looks nice, and the music is quite amazing. And after you beat the game, it starts Hardmode, which is implemented in a quite interesting way. Instead of just giving you trickier puzzles or a limited number of wells, it gives you the same puzzles, slightly modified, all enemies are affected by gravity, and you can only use regular gravity wells. This really caught me off guard, because for most of the game, I was using tha Anti-Wells in a sort of rocket jump way to clear the levels. I had to change up my playstyle, and it was kind of cool. However, my biggest problem with Defy Gravity is the bugs. These weren't just small things, they happened every single time I played. When I start the game, I always need to close out of it in task manager and start it again before the graphics will work, and on some levels you need to shoot a gravity well off before the graphics will start, which can get very irritating, especially if there's an enemy nearby. But despite these problems, I enjoyed it. It's creative and fun. If you can pick it up for a few bucks, I say get it. And thank me for not using a Wicked joke throughout this whole review.

												Simple and easy are two words to describe this game,is really fun,the graphics are what you can expect from an indie platformer,the music gets catchy after a while,which is good.The gameplay is easy,WASD,Q,E and the mouse,if you want to play a Portal-like game,this can be for you,it makes you think outside of the box,mostly because there's not only one way to clear the levels,it depends on how you think and how fast you can think.I recommend this game a lot,it's really fun and entertaining.

												Holy hell if that isnt a tough game. The initial levels took me about 30 minutes to go through but hard mode try an hour and a half. So here's my feelings on the game in 3 catagories...Gameplay:The gameplay is fun and easy to grasp, each level offers a new challange. The early levels are easy but as I got to the last 5 it took a few deaths to formulate a strategy. The gravity gun is a very interesting mechanic, left click fires a blue ball that sucks things in and the right click was an orange ball that pushed things away. I like the idea and would love to see the same concept done in a 3d environment. Overall, the mechanics were smooth and no glitches occured.Graphics:Not really an important part of this game as I'd have been just as happy with 8bit. The graphics are smooth and made for 1080p screens. The animations are basic with very few frames but this isnt really a con to the game. Really I think the artwork done for this game fit the theme and looked rather good for what it is.Sound:The music for this game is rather nice, one moment its calm and relaxing and then in some levels the music speeds up a bit for escape levels. One nice thing I'd like to note is that the sound enemies make when they bounce off of walls is there but not distracting. That I believe is very important and I'm very happy that they were careful about the volume of that ting noise they make.Overall I can definately recomend this game to casual and hardcore gamers alike. 10/10			",152,39,3,27,15,1,9

												This is a nice short game with a good soundtrack.The concept on which it is based is very interesting, although it could be better implemented. You use your gun to create gravity or anti-gravity wells in order to make your way through the levels.Gravity is hard to manipulate and it can get frustrating to try so many times before succeeding, relying a bit too much on luck with the timings and the hard-to-predict behaviour of the wells.The controls are easy enough (although I had some trouble with the jumping, as it would only jump after I ran off the edge) and, again, the soundtrack is quite good.The graphics, however, aren't the best around, even though I believe the look somewhat agrees with the game. Nevertheless, the game is visually consistent and the space setting is always pleasing.With all that said, I found the game to be nice, but also frustrating and somewhat boring after a while. The good thing, though, is that it is short.All in all, it is a fun, short-lived experience, if you can keep your cool after dying so many times on the same spot because your gravity well didn't pull you well enough. I recommend you give it a try, especially since you can get it very cheap on sale.			",339,111,5,53,29,3,21

Morlan's shorts:A little space-suited fella (might be a lass, not sure, I couldn't notice lipstick, lip gloss, eye shadow or eyeliner though. Hm.. a tad much to know about the female appearance! Anyhow just kidding because the info says that it actually is a girl, named Kara) that uses a gravity gun to pull-push objects, avoid lethal robots/lasers/varied baddies and reach the final destination..A seemingly simple run'n'jump('n'gravitate-yourself) arcade-puzzle-ish type of game but with increasingly difficult levels the last of which will require very precise movements, use of all your experience from the early ones and some degree of luck to finish them..The graphics are simple yet nicely detailed and effective in conveying the atmosphere of the game and there's an accompanying soundtrack that's easy to listen and doesn't get too repetitive or boring.Last achievement is quite hard to accomplish and you could reach rage-quitting levels..but in the end it's' worth the satisfying feeling that..you made it!It was one of the first games I bought here and the first one I finished, but I only care about that. Nothing to see here.. keep walkingI give it BFG out of CIA!Final Verdict: Non-roman thumbie: 👍 !Don't waste more time reading lengthy reviews.. time is of the essence! ",557,287,10,56,35,6,96

												Sales review, with 95% discount, sold the trading card twice the amount I bought.The game itself is not bad as we can see from the review.Basically the game is about moving your♥♥♥♥♥to a door with the help of your super gravitation controller gun.It is easy most of the time until you got into a certain stage which is frustrating since you had to jump over and over again to finish the stage.Overall it is good puzzle game.

												This is a good game, but depending on what you're really expecting from a casual puzzle platformer, this game might not be for you. Takes a little effort and skills to go through late game, so you'll either end up enjoying it, or have more hair-pulling rage moments then you expect.Not bad to kill time when taking a break from the usual power gaming. But if you ask me, it should've been free, and not worth paying for. You can grab it when it's on sale, otherwise, there are way too many other options to choose from.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Defy Gravity is one of the worst games I've ever played. The idea itself is not bad: armed with a gravity gun, you have to make your way through all kind of (jumping) puzzles. Not enterily original, but still.But. Almost everything else about this game is awful. Sorry for the harsh words, but I find no others means to describe my feelings during playing. Controls are very, very poor, which is disastrous for this kind of game. I played it on an Xbox360 controller, which should be fine, but alas, no.Graphics are even worse - even in the 1980's, games looked way better. Sound is almost non-existent.The only reason I can see to buy this game, is for the trading cards and the xp when you craft the badge. The game is, understandably, very, very cheap, so you can even make a few eurocents if you sell the cards. Oh, there are Steam achievements too, but I gave up after under an hour out of sheer frustration.No detailed rating, but surely only 3/10 or so - and that's just for the cards. Otherwise, it would be even less.			",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

												For now - the cheapest game i've ever seen, cheaper is only a free one.So ""pluses"":+ A good game for having a rest. + Good musiс set. Though it has only several glees, they remind me the 80th-90th - the songs of space theme improve the environment.+ The game makes you think about your tactics and rapidity, that's why you should strain your logics.+ Short levels and frequent autosaves - that will help you not to break you pc, when you try to handle a level.And minuses:- Sometimes the character doesn't jump, but i don't know whether it is a bug or i do something wrong.- The cost justifies the game itself - rather short, but i don't think that the aim of the game was to involve you for many hours. Just to pass it through once and then play just when you don't know what to do.If you are a game collector - buy it. If you like arcades - buy it. If you like space songs reminding the 80th - buy it. A fortiori that it costs only $0.07 when it is on sale.			",48,1,1,6,1,0,6

												This game is actually a fairly enjoyable experience. The game mechanics consist of platforming with the addition of being able to set gravity fields that either pull or push you away from them to avoid obstacles or solve platforming puzzles.As a BONUS, if you pick this game up while it's on sale (like I did for 14c), you can sell the cards you obtain from it and make a profit (whilst adding another game to your Steam library and having a bit of fun with it).

												Steering away from all of the ""Made a profit off of the cards,"" reviews, this game was probably one of my favorite platformers ever. Though it's exceptionally short (maybe a four, five hour game), Defy Gravity stuck with me even after completing it. The trailer does not do it justice, and everything about this game is very immersive. Highly recommended.			",153,13,0,6,5,1,10

												What the hell?! The game is now so much more expensive than it was before!This game is surprisingly good for its former price. Pros: the difficulty is just right: it get's more difficult as you advance, but not to the point that you want to throw your computer against the wall. Cheap. At least it was. It was so cheap that you would actually make money from it by selling its cards! Easy 100% achievements; the graphic sprites aren't great, but are ok;  sound effects and music are satisfying. is not repetitive.Cons: if you have high expectations, this game will be too simple for you; no controls rebinding; not worth its current price; poor interface; one short gameplay and nothing else to do. No extras.For its current prince (BRL 6.29, USD 2.99), I do not think it's worth, but I will say it for my experience with this game, not only actually playing the game, but also considering the price I paid — almost nothing (BRL 0.24, which is USD 0.07): it was worth the value, so I recommend this.

												What the hell?! The game is now so much more expensive than it was before!This game is surprisingly good for its former price. Pros: the difficulty is just right: it get's more difficult as you advance, but not to the point that you want to throw your computer against the wall. Cheap. At least it was. It was so cheap that you would actually make money from it by selling its cards! Easy 100% achievements; the graphic sprites aren't great, but are ok;  sound effects and music are satisfying. is not repetitive.Cons: if you have high expectations, this game will be too simple for you; no controls rebinding; not worth its current price; poor interface; one short gameplay and nothing else to do. No extras.For its current prince (BRL 6.29, USD 2.99), I do not think it's worth, but I will say it for my experience with this game, not only actually playing the game, but also considering the price I paid — almost nothing (BRL 0.24, which is USD 0.07): it was worth the value, so I recommend this.

												It's pretty decent game. It looks like Portal clone but there you have gravity gun :pleft mouse button for gravity well (it will attract your character and also some enemies)right mouse button for anti-gravity (same like above but it will repel) / You won't have it in second run (hard mode) so it will be challengingeven colours of gravity affected areas (bound for mouse buttons) are the same like in Portal :pThis game is very easy it takes about 3 / 4 hours (if you fail so much like me ^^) to completely finish it with 100% achievements, also you have a lot of checkpoints. Defy Gravity costs (now) only 0,09€ so it's very cheap.Unfortunately this game is short but concept is interesting.6/10			",512,249,14,49,62,6,68

												So Defy Gravity, quite a nice platformer, and I'm very terrible at these -.-. But this has handy mechanic which puts you in control of two wells one is pulling you (and other objects) towards it, the other is pushing you away. This allows for some dodging and jump'n'run action. Additionally you have a shield to protect you from these effects. I liked:++ unique gameplay mechanic+ cheap price (0,09€ in Steam Sale), extremely good value for your money+ challenging but doable, either with try and error or a by planning ahead++ multiple solutions for puzzles+ relatively fast respawnI disliked:- not so good collision meshes- no visual difference, levels are all looking similar to each other, variety would improve the overall experience- story is missing :((((- strange point-and-shoot feature, which requires timing (only when you release the mouse button a gravity well is created)- controls are unchangeable (but there is controller support)At the time of writing this review I did not finish the game once, but I think I may need a total of about 4 hours with my bad skills...I would recommend this game, because of its new mechanic and it is a great game to spent some time.

												This game is pure value for those that love puzzles and platformers.  It gives you just enough control to have fun with experimenting ways to solve each level which is a quite refreshing from the usual platformer.

												Not sure why this game isn't just another flash game out there. Also not sure why it costs money but it is a bit entertaining. Good for an hour until it becomes stale.

												So Defy Gravity, quite a nice platformer, and I'm very terrible at these -.-. But this has handy mechanic which puts you in control of two wells one is pulling you (and other objects) towards it, the other is pushing you away. This allows for some dodging and jump'n'run action. Additionally you have a shield to protect you from these effects. I liked:++ unique gameplay mechanic+ cheap price (0,09€ in Steam Sale), extremely good value for your money+ challenging but doable, either with try and error or a by planning ahead++ multiple solutions for puzzles+ relatively fast respawnI disliked:- not so good collision meshes- no visual difference, levels are all looking similar to each other, variety would improve the overall experience- story is missing :((((- strange point-and-shoot feature, which requires timing (only when you release the mouse button a gravity well is created)- controls are unchangeable (but there is controller support)At the time of writing this review I did not finish the game once, but I think I may need a total of about 4 hours with my bad skills...I would recommend this game, because of its new mechanic and it is a great game to spent some time.

												This puzzle platformer is an enjoyable, quick, and (for this generation) hard game. Its achievements, although slightly buggy, are easy and basically the only drive you have to continue. I, personally, found this game fun although at points it got on my nerves because I died over, and over, and over again. However, I know quite a few people who didn’t like it at all so if your inpatient or have lots of good games to play, don’t buy this game. I bought this game on sale for 17 cents and sold its cards for more than that. Yes, you read that right and let me say it again 17 CENTS. It’s really hard to go wrong with a game you earned money by buying. In conclusion, this is a cheap game that’s an easily 100% and is actually quiet fun (for a 17 cent game anyways).

												The game sucks. It really does. The controls are mostly functional, but usually not when you actually need them to be. The game randomly switches to a completely black screen in the middle of play, so you can't continue until you manage to fix it. Once youactually figure out how to use the controlls correctly to slingshot yourself around, the game becomes incredibly easy. Oh, and then there's the whole fact that this game looks and plays like it was made in Game Maker.I got it for $0.99, though, and it pretty much paid itself off with the trading cards, so I'm really not complaining.

												Deviously difficult platformer, that somehow has a hard mode too. This game is frustrating at times, and at certain points sometimes unfair. Especially in hard mode the difficulty skyrockets in the last few levels due to a small amount of checkpoints, and an incredible small margin for errors.That said: If you like platformers, and don't mind trying the same part of a level over and over and over and over and over again until you nail it, this is the game for you.As a plus, this game has a pretty good soundtrack to keep you company while you see the message ""Press jump to try again."" for the 100th time.It took me almost 6 hours to complete normal mode and hard mode and thus get all achievements. Not bad for a $2 price tag, or even less during a sale.			",43,6,0,2,9,0,6

												Pretty cool game. As others have noted, if you get it at a good sale price (0.29 cents, for instance) it's very possible to make more selling the cards you get than you paid for the game. Beyond that, however, it's just a lot of fun... it can be frustrating at times, but it's still very fair. The achievements are easy, but not too easy. It's not very long, but it's still long enough to justify the price.Bottom line: even at full price, it's worth it. But if you can get it on sale (the aforementioned 0.29 cents, for example) it's a no-brainer.			",1141,321,39,126,126,17,147

												OK, so I bought it with 95% off for 0.14$ only, which is practically free.And yes, I guess that even for the full price of 3$ it's okay, well it is an indie game.But you should know that this game is very buggy, and clearly not test-played well enough, as the levels are far from perfect. Third way through, 0.5 hrs on record, I'm already growing weary of it, as the levels are not as challenging as they are tedious.Now, the concept is good and with a better game design it actually might be a great game: for starters, we should not get all the powers at the first level, but attain them as the game advances. This way it won't be so easy, with so many ways to tackle each obstacle, and it won't have that premature feeling of exhaustion.The way the game is right now, I would recommend avoiding it; it is cheap, but probably doesn't worth your time. I have played many, many indie games over the years and none of them was sold half-baked as this one.			",257,85,2,31,30,2,61

												The game was $0.29, so I figured why not? When it's on sale for so cheap, there is definitely enough content for it to be worth the price, but overall the game wasn't great. The controls feel slow, and the physics aren't anything special. There's pretty much no story, so don't expect it to be thought provoking in any way. The game isn't bad, but it just isn't good.

												Controls are unresponsive and all most objects seems to have randomised hit-boxes. This will make you furious and tired of playing this game. I can appreciate a difficult game, but not an unfair one. Defy Gravity Extender have some cool ideas, but the controls and level design just ruins it. It tries to be Portal copycat with some other elements, but it never feels like anything else then a simple school project.The graphics are very simple, but okay. It looks like a web browser flash game almost. The music is, in my opinion, the best part about the game, however it can get repetitive after a while. Only pick this game up on sale if you want trading cards. You can sell the cards for the same price as this game, maybe even earn some cash. Based on gameplay and enjoyment I cannot however recommend this title.			",1471,589,50,140,180,18,243

												Considering its price tag, Defy Gravity could have been a decent puzzle platformer that lets the player shoot blue and orange points of gravitational pull and repulsion to navigate through the world, a la Portal, if it wasn't for the unappealing graphics and a game breaking lack of screen resolution support. Since the game uses the default desktop resolution, with no way to change it in-game, or even to switch to windowed mode, if a particular resolution is not supported, you would only be able to see a small part of the screen. The developer tried to remedy this by providing batch files that run the game windowed, but I was not able to use them because they refused to see that Steam is running and would just tell me to start Steam first... There is no reason why these settings could not be built into the game menu, and the way it stands now, Defy Gravity is unplayable for those with resolutions over 1080p.			",653,174,17,56,25,4,65

												I regret getting this game. It doesnt matter that i got it on sale. This game just doesn't appeal to me. It's just too hard for me and some levels are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard that i start raging a lot. At least they could do some kind of help tool if you get stuck and you can't proceed to the next bloody hard level. I had some good hopes for this game but I guess I was wrong. I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy it it just doesnt seem to be in my likings. I don't recommend this game for people who rage a lot because it will ruin their life sorta. Rated 6/10!

												""buy da game wen it on sale den sel da cards for more!1!!"" - Every review for this game, ever.This game is actually not that bad on the early stages, it introduces you to all the aspects and all most the enemies, now that wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that the stages in the later game get really bloody boring, and tedious. To the point where the puzzles aren't fun, just a grind. If you're going to get this game, get it on sale, don't get it for the full price, it's not an awful game, but I still can't recommend it to anyone to actually play. So, as every other review states;1. Buy the game when it's on sale2. Idle for the cards3. Sell the cards on market4. Profit.			",366,113,4,36,40,2,37

												If the concept seems really enjoyable to you, go for it! If you're just curious, maybe get it on sale or look for something else.+ Cool idea+ Good learning curve+ Good level design, teaches a mechanic with simple problems before bring up the same problem in with timing.+ Mostly well placed checkpoints on the levels, early on you don't have to redo obstacles you've already handled+ You can almost earn back the money you spent from the two trading cards if the game is on sale.- Won't work before you look for a simple workaround on the forums (developers instructions are unclear if you don't understand what a command line is or how to use it on Steam)- Dull graphics- Poor checkpoint pacing later on; about 40 minutes into the game you spend considerable time getting over large hazard areas and have to redo the whole thing if you die at the last moment- The graphics often get a little jittery, increasing the visual unpleasentness.Overall 5/10, with the technical problems pushing my view into the negative.

												The game feels fine. It's a solid puzzle game. It does the whole ""I'm trying to be portal"" thing in the first act, and there are a few gripping, quick-paced moments, but it's all ruined by the ATROCIOUS art style. The fun part of an indie game is the simplicity, sure, but when the art style is this neglected, it all feels very sloppy. They even describe the character, when obviously all you need for this game is ""You are a dude in a space suit. Have fun."" Sure, I got what I paid for at a staggering 0.23 or so USD on sale, but that isn't saying a lot. Hell, the font the WHOLE GAME uses is the default one from MS Word.All in all, unless you just want to waste .30 cents, don't get this game. Play a flash puzzle game instead, those are fun and usually free.			",114,13,0,7,7,2,4

												It's a very good physics-based indie platformer game. Great for wannabe astrophysicists and space lovers. In this game, you've to work your way through the Gauntlet (a space competition) as a female space ninja, Kara, who can bend the laws of physics using Grav-wells and Anti-wells. If you're creative and played games like Angry Birds Space and liked them, you'll like it too! It develops your problem solving and lateral thinking skills because certain levels in the game are quite challenging. The soundtracks are also great and help you to focus on the gameplay. But the game is very short. Newbies may find the latter levels quite hard (some may even have to retry up to 10 times). It's recommended to buy this game on a sale because you can make a profit by selling the card drops as the price drops to $0.14 only!			",23,0,0,0,0,0,0

PROS:+ interesting concept+ checkpoint system in the earlier parts of the game+ Steam trading cards CONS:- gimmicky puzzles with enemy objects- bad hitboxes for both your character and enemy objects- Hard mode is just plain annoying without anti-gravity wellsComment:I read some reviews about how this game is challenging and you feel rewarded when you finish it. But after doing normal mode AND the hard mode ... well, I cannot agree. The first half of the levels are great, they are focused of puzzles on how to move forward through the level. The second half is really gimmicky, focused on avoiding enemy objects which actually have square hitboxes even though they are not square. Same goes for your character - Kara. There is no story so puzzles are the only thing interesting here and they begin to be very annoying as you progress. This is even more so in the Hard mode where you do not have anti-gravity wells. Through this the game becomes just gimmicky and not really fun. Also ""easy to 100%"" is not that easy as you have to beat Hard mode and that is a pure test of will and luck. The reason why I recommend this in the end is mainly for the trading cards...P.S.: I played this game without music because I had to put '-nomusic' in the launcher, otherwise the game crashed. Apparently this is due to Windows Media Player being required which I do not have...			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

												Is it worth 15 cents?

												The game is interesting, not too hard in the beginning but gets challenging after you get the 4th achievement. A friend of mine quit the game because he couldn't do the levels after 4th that but if you have played Super Meat Boy like me you won't find it that hard. :D I got it on sale and now after selling the cards it will be almost or even free. Definitely recommend it, it's really cheap when on sale, if you don't like it you won't lose much. :)			",639,255,13,40,61,10,85

Yes. Do I recommend the game? Yes. Why? You can't beat the price ands it not that bad once you get the hang of it. I just don't see myself playing for any longer then 3 hours total playtime.

												Absolutely amazing game. Worth the price. It has the style of portal, without portals. You have a gravity gun (how many volvos am I going to refrence today?) that shoots gravity wells. They will suck you in or push you out- a black hole concept, while trying to get through the Gauntlet. You go through a series of waves of enemies, and if you truly want to put your skills to the test, at the end, there is a hardmode.Pro 1 ABSOLUTELY AMAZING soundtrack. It fits perfectly.Pro 2 Unique game mechanics. I have never seen them before.Pro 3 Nice and cheap, especially when you have a coupon that makes it 74 cents :PCon 1... hmm... hard to think... Short? Sure, why not? I'm sure they'll update it though.8.9/10. Would spend the extra 3 dollars to play it.			",36,4,0,3,4,0,1

												If this game is on sale, it's probably stupidly cheap and well worth at least the trading cards you get from it. It's a fairly short 2-3 hour full game if you're already good at platformers in general and getting a feel for game mechanics, but the music change-ups can keep you around if you're halfway in and might start to get bored. The music gives you a feeling of purpose, with a trippy dreamscape allure, or some such shaite( I dunno man, I'm no critique). I love that the music corresponds to certain level themes, it's what really distinguishes this from some flash game on Kongregate. That, and the good amount of difficulty later on and in the ""Extended"" portion(basically just hard mode).Overall, keep it on your wishlist and wait for it to cost like thirty cents at the most, it runs very smooth for what it is, so no glitches just dreamy atmosphere, simple game mechanics, and yada yada good things to say about this game.

												This game is fun, but the controls are ridiculously hard to handle and prevent you from really having a good time in later levels.  You have to contort your left hand when playing with keyboard when you want to move any direction after disabling a gravity well or try to press the diectional button as soon as you press a disabling button, and that isnt as easy as it sounds, especially in the later levels where you have to keep pace with a moving platorm and you don't have tie to set yourself up to make the movements.  Aiming is also fairly difficult, becuase the game camera is not always centered on your character, so your crosshair might not be where you want it when you need to use it.  Crosshair style 2 kind of fixes this, but sets your crosshair at a fixed radius, which might not be welcomed by some (including myself).The concept behind this game is novel and fun during the easier stages, but when the difficulty ramps up, you begin to realize just how bad the controls are.

												Even for a really cheap and simple game, this is a great platformer, it requires a good amount of skills to go trought the harder parts of the game, it's original, it's smart and simple. As a veteran gamer I actually loved it, gameplay is awesome, and the music is just amazingly beautiful. I would totally recomend this game to people who are looking for a good 2d scroller platformer combining classic stuff with new mechanics. But seriously.. the soundtrack is just amazing! Cons: It was kind of short, it deserves a part 2 or at least a DLC with new levels.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Its kind of short which is nice if you want to add another perfect game to your collection. Its one of those games which quickly challenges you to complete it, as its simplicity is deceptive. You will find yourself with tense calves, and lurching playing this game ... nough said.  ",1976,709,69,213,226,21,273

												Defy Gravity is a very interesting game. You play as some astronaut guy and you traverse levels using a ""gravity gun."" This gravity gun can create portals that attract you toward them and portals that force you away from them. The gameplay mechanics and level design of this game are actually impressive! The game starts pretty easy but near the end some levels are litterally the deepest pits of hell. The ""hard mode"" of the game, which is unlocked after completing the normal mode, is actually much easier because you don't have to deal with the anti-gravity portals. Anyway, Defy Gravity is pretty fun, and on sale it's definitely worth it! (I got it for 29 cents.)Gameplay: 10/10 (Very fun game!)Dificulty:10/10 (There were a couple levels that actually disemboweled me...)Replay value: 8/10 (I can definitely see myself playing it again! And dying many more times...)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a platform kind of game.Interface/Menu/SettingsNone.About the game.You are playing with a dude in a white suit in space. He has a gravity gun which will help him across obstacles and other situations. He will get sucked into the gravity ball and goes to the centre of the gravity ball. He also has an anti-well gun where  he will get repelled from. He will get pushed away from the center to reach higher area's. You can also use the gravity shield to protect you from the guns effect.There is an in-game tutorial.Graphics are dull and simple.You are able to use a xbox controller if turned on.You see a small controller manual when pressing esc.Other things.None.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10			",467,171,6,45,49,1,62

Didn't act pretentious, didn't introduce unnecessary mechanics. Doesn't try to tie you up with some half-arsed story, and doesn't ask that you perform repetitive tasks.If you're looking for a fun little way to spend an afternoon, Defy Gravity should satisfy your cravings.

As a veteran gamer I actually loved it, gameplay is awesome, and the music is just amazingly beautiful. I would totally recomend this game to people who are looking for a good 2d scroller platformer combining classic stuff with new mechanics. But seriously.. the soundtrack is just amazing! Cons: It was kind of short, it deserves a part 2 or at least a DLC with new levels.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Remembering the controls and what they do is quite challenging to get down and is a bit of a mind♥♥♥♥. However, the gameplay is fun and enjoyable with lots of ways to beat each mission and is very replayable. And besides, if you don't like it? It's $0.14 right now, get the cards,, sell the cards and you've now made $0.27, (+13 cents) PROFIT! Either way it's a win/win. :)			",22,3,0,1,1,0,0

Short but very fun platformerYour gun shoots pockets of gravity/anti-gravity that you use to assist you in reaching the end of the level, some parts are a little challenging but nothing to difficult.This game is a little short but it is still definitely worth it for the price.

												Absolutely amazing game. Worth the price. It has the style of portal, without portals. You have a gravity gun (how many volvos am I going to refrence today?) that shoots gravity wells. They will suck you in or push you out- a black hole concept, while trying to get through the Gauntlet. You go through a series of waves of enemies, and if you truly want to put your skills to the test, at the end, there is a hardmode.Pro 1 ABSOLUTELY AMAZING soundtrack. It fits perfectly.Pro 2 Unique game mechanics. I have never seen them before.Pro 3 Nice and cheap, especially when you have a coupon that makes it 74 cents :PCon 1... hmm... hard to think... Short? Sure, why not? I'm sure they'll update it though.8.9/10. Would spend the extra 3 dollars to play it.			",36,4,0,3,4,0,1

												If this game is on sale, it's probably stupidly cheap and well worth at least the trading cards you get from it. It's a fairly short 2-3 hour full game if you're already good at platformers in general and getting a feel for game mechanics, but the music change-ups can keep you around if you're halfway in and might start to get bored. The music gives you a feeling of purpose, with a trippy dreamscape allure, or some such shaite( I dunno man, I'm no critique). I love that the music corresponds to certain level themes, it's what really distinguishes this from some flash game on Kongregate. That, and the good amount of difficulty later on and in the ""Extended"" portion(basically just hard mode).Overall, keep it on your wishlist and wait for it to cost like thirty cents at the most, it runs very smooth for what it is, so no glitches just dreamy atmosphere, simple game mechanics, and yada yada good things to say about this game.

												The core gameplay mechanic of this game just felt poorly tuned.  The player felt slow, and the jumping felt heavy and unforgiving.  If the gravity was less strong, and the player a bit faster, and levels a bit bigger and more zoomed out, it might have been easier to get into.  Maybe I would've felt more in control, and it would've been easier to find the fun in this game.On top of that, the difficulty curve spiked up way too fast.  The game was asking me to commit really hard really early to a platforming mechanic that I'd had absolutely no time to learn and no opportunity to enjoy, so I just gave up.  There may have been some interesting puzzles later on down the line, but the gameplay itself wasn't engaging enough to keep me interested long enough to find out.			",330,94,25,11,32,3,35

												This game is fun, but the controls are ridiculously hard to handle and prevent you from really having a good time in later levels.  You have to contort your left hand when playing with keyboard when you want to move any direction after disabling a gravity well or try to press the diectional button as soon as you press a disabling button, and that isnt as easy as it sounds, especially in the later levels where you have to keep pace with a moving platorm and you don't have tie to set yourself up to make the movements.  Aiming is also fairly difficult, becuase the game camera is not always centered on your character, so your crosshair might not be where you want it when you need to use it.  Crosshair style 2 kind of fixes this, but sets your crosshair at a fixed radius, which might not be welcomed by some (including myself).The concept behind this game is novel and fun during the easier stages, but when the difficulty ramps up, you begin to realize just how bad the controls are.

												When I bought this game for $0.14, I only had the trading cards in mind. What I actually paid for was a fantastic platformer with a very unique and interesting concept to fuel the open-ended movement style: gravity.Pros:+Gravity at the dispense of the player is an amazing concept that the game executes beautifully+Freedom to make it through levels as you'd like: while the levels are indeed linear, the strategies the player can use to traverse them are not+""Hard mode"" that extends replayability+It cost me $0.14 manCons:-I finished the game in about an hour and a half; however, even at the full $3 price tag I'd be plenty happy with what I got out of my first time through-As far as I'm concerned, the game has no story whatsoever other than that the protagonist is a woman named Kara with a special ability.These cons mean nothing considering the pros though, and it's a shame to know so few people have heard of this game. I recommend anybody pick it up.			",196,40,1,15,6,2,19

												Definitely worth its current price of 0,14€, especially since you'll get your money back by selling the trading cards.For the low low price of free, you'll get about 1.7 hours of semi-fun platformer action.

Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",155,33,5,11,17,4,24

												It's a simple yet beautiful puzzle game that actualy stumped me a few times. It's hard mode is also very impressive, as instead of a standard more enemy HP/time limit/etc, now you can't use anti-gravity wells which forces you to go all ninja everywhere on the map. All the enemies are also now effected by regular gravity wells, so you shouldn't stay in a particular well for very long.Amazingly well thought-out game. Definately buy this.			",133,26,3,8,36,0,35

												Good platformer with good mechanics for the money. The game pays for itself with the trading cards if you grab it on sale! If I had to give an overall score, I'd say this game's about a 7/10. Visuals aren't anything special. Gameplay is nice. Music is pretty good as well. Chances are, the gravity mechanics will make you rage at some point. Good game overall.			",337,60,7,69,18,5,20

												I can't say that I've finished the game... Yet. I'm about two-thirds or three-quarters of the way through, so I'm fairly close to finishing it.This game, whether you're reading this review during a sale or during regular prices, the game is worth the $3 or $0.29. Now trust me, I looked at the pictures and I wasn't thinking it was gonna be that great since the level design didn't look that good. But I can confirm that it's pretty amazing.I want to point out that in the description it says ""Unique physics engine that provides a never before experienced gameplay experience"", they're not joking. I haven't really had a puzzle/platformer games have me use both gravity (pull) and anti-gravity (push) fields to complete a level.As of the difficulty of the game, I wouldn't say it's Super Meat Boy level, but it's definitely not any Superfrog HD.But don't forget the music. It may be only two or three tracks, but they're pretty good for a little indie game of this size (Roughly 50 MB).All the music and tiny little bugs and such included, I give this a solid 7/10.EDIT: I've completely finished the game now. I do think that this could have a solid sequel with more levels and I actually look forward to one. I still stick with my 7/10 :)			",214,25,9,12,11,6,20

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a platform kind of game.Interface/Menu/SettingsNone.About the game.You are playing with a dude in a white suit in space. He has a gravity gun which will help him across obstacles and other situations. He will get sucked into the gravity ball and goes to the centre of the gravity ball. He also has an anti-well gun where  he will get repelled from. He will get pushed away from the center to reach higher area's. You can also use the gravity shield to protect you from the guns effect.There is an in-game tutorial.Graphics are dull and simple.You are able to use a xbox controller if turned on.You see a small controller manual when pressing esc.Other things.None.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10			",467,171,6,45,49,1,62

YouTube™ Video: Steam Cleaning - Defy Gravity Extended 

			Views: 7		

			A very humble game, Defy Gravity's clever mechanics and puzzle design are hidden behind weak visuals and presentation. If you can look past a weak first impression the game will quickly grow on you.		

A very humble game, Defy Gravity's clever mechanics and puzzle design are hidden behind weak visuals and presentation.  If you can look past a weak first impression the game will quickly grow on you.Armed with a weapon that creates gravity wells that will retract or repulse you, unless your grave shield is on and a simple jet pack for extra jumping height.  Use these tools to solve increasingly complex platform based puzzles.			",1293,574,45,182,174,17,247

Doesn't try to tie you up with some half-arsed story, and doesn't ask that you perform repetitive tasks.If you're looking for a fun little way to spend an afternoon, Defy Gravity should satisfy your cravings.

												Defy Gravity is a pretty challenging and fun platformer if you can ignore the bad graphics and the overall presentation.You play as what seems to be an astronaut with some sort of a gravity gun that can create gravity anomalies that help you advance through various levels, some of which will require a lot of thinking and planning to complete.The game itself is fun and there's definitely lots of hours of gameplay here, so really the only downside to all of this is that it looks a bit amateurish due to poor graphics and mediocre sound. But don't let that stop you. It's actually pretty awesome.			",329,77,2,41,53,2,38

			Views: 7		

			A very humble game, Defy Gravity's clever mechanics and puzzle design are hidden behind weak visuals and presentation. If you can look past a weak first impression the game will quickly grow on you.		

A very humble game, Defy Gravity's clever mechanics and puzzle design are hidden behind weak visuals and presentation.  If you can look past a weak first impression the game will quickly grow on you.Armed with a weapon that creates gravity wells that will retract or repulse you, unless your grave shield is on and a simple jet pack for extra jumping height.  Use these tools to solve increasingly complex platform based puzzles.			",1293,574,45,182,174,17,247

												Story: ~5/10 The story is very, very simple. I don't think the developers intended to elaborate on this part. The gameplay is more important. Story not needed.Controls: 9/10 Really fluid. However, to place a gravity well, you click and hold, and a well will be thrown in the direction you clicked. To make the well stop moving, you release the click. This gets rather annoying. as it would be better if the well stopped exactly where you clicked.Graphics: 3/10 Horrid. However, the space backgrounds and gravity wells are okay.Music: 8/10 Creates a nice atmosphere.Difficulty Balancing: 8/10 Good balancing between too easy/too hard.Needed Features:-Slightly better control sceme-Level mapOverall: 8/10 Good for 14 cents			",337,98,8,31,23,3,29

												I actually liked the game. Controls are good, music is okay and graphics are not the best but for the 20-30 cents you bought it what would you expect. This game looks like a school project that made it to steam. The idea is not bad, but i think they didn't fully realized its potential. I think they should have added more elements, a story and maybe even a final boss. On the picture of the game we see a girl with purple hair. I expected she would remove her helmet and reveal that she was a girl after the a final boss like in Metroid.Overall it's a good game for the money you're giving. I would give it a 7/10.

This is like one of those ugly Greenlight games that should never pass, and don't ask me how it ended up on Steam on the first place, being rather simple and unsighty.Still, there is one excuse for it: Next time it will cost like 30 cents, buy it and you'll get yourself like 45 cents worth of cards!

												Revision: After playing a little more with this game all I can say is: The Physics in this game are way to unpredictable to be fun. The only reason to get this game is to make money by selling the trading cards when it is on discount. Other than that: Avoid it at any cost.Original Review:Ok, I got this game in the same sale as assumely most people here atm.The game idea itself isn't so bad. You are an astronut :) holding some sort of space-gun. With this gun you can shoot two different types of missile-like projectiles that aim the direction you're pointing the cursor at and explode as soon as you let go the mousebutton.One of the projectiles creates an orb that sucks you in and the other one creates one that pushes you away. You have a doublejump too but you won't get very far in this game unless you master the correctly timed placement of those two orb-type-thingies to drive your player around the different courses.The difficulty curve starts fair and easy and there even is a tutorial at the beginning of the game explaining all the different things you can do. But really it isn't much more as I mentioned before. There are some types of ""enemies"" though. Some cannot be touched but jumped on and another sort cannot be touched at all. If you do so nonetheless you'll get killed instantly.Sounds interesting eh?Well it is (as long as you can cope with the plain graphics and leveldesign). But there is one major flaw that renders this game nearly impossible to play at higher levels: The physics everything is based on really aren't that perfectly done. I died plenty of times because the player sprite fell through a correctly placed push-orb or didn't get sucked to a suck-orb.And yes this sucks (even without any orb) and so pushes one away from the game way too soon ... Without these flaws it could easily be a nice game because, as I said in the beginning of this review, the core game idea is good. But due to the fact of the imperfect physics I think that most players won't get very far ...But what the heck. All in all you get this game for free because you can always trade in the trading cards and maybe even make a few bucks plus this way. So maybe I'm just a sucker at this game and you will have great fun with it.For the price they're asking right now you should give this game a try if you're into platforming action-puzzlers. At least you can't loose anything in the process ...			",276,66,8,23,21,3,37

												Ugh, this game is alright, I suppose. Definitely not the worst game I've ever played.The controls are horrible, for a start. I kept messing up because instinct told me to hold W, even though that is jump and holding jump is liable to get you killed, because space is also jump, and you can't jump if you're holding both jump buttons.Graphics are Flash-era. The game is too, sort of.The puzzles are... Some of them are easy, some of them are hard, and some of them are just deathtraps to annoy you. Mostly deathtraps. Checkpoints are placed before/after every puzzle, which is nice.However, working with gravity and anti-gravity, well... it's a fun concept, and it was fun at times in this game as well, but due to the fact that most 'puzzles' are just deathtraps with tons of hazards, it's not really that fun.The music is alright, though.Oh yeah, and don't try playing this game with a controller. You need the high sensitivity of a mouse to even attempt half these puzzles.And the dev is fishy, too. Bumping back the release date just so it always appears in Upcoming Titles. Considering the publisher's name, I shouldn't be surprised.(get it? fish factory, fishy dev? ah, forget it) ",87,6,0,4,4,1,6

												The game mechanic is interesting, but that's pretty much it. The game wasn't polished enough to keep up my interest after attempting the same stretch of level ten times over before being able to reach the next part.

												It's hard to reccomend this game at full price, but I guess it's okay if you snag it in a sale.The game consists of platforming and using a gun that can create gravity wells that either pull you in or repel you. You can probably beat the entire game in under an hour then replay it again on hard mode to get the final achievement in one more hour.Some of the puzzzles are legitimately difficult which was fun. Hard mode was great. This game is just so very short.			",77,21,1,10,2,0,14

												Yes yes, You can just buy the game for the trading cards and sell them, That's lovely.However the actual game itself, Isn't that bad. I mean the mechanics are pretty standard, And the time required to actually 100% the game takes just under two hours, But it isn't that bad.This isn't going to be one of the games I recommend to people, But I won't tell them not to buy it either if asked. The price is fair for what it is, And while it's not going to be one of games people spend days passing, Less than a dollar is more than fair for two hours of lifetime.I've read a few other reviews this game is moderately difficult, I didn't find that at all. Granted there were 2-3 areas that took me a couple of attempts to pass, But that wasn't because the area was hard, More of I was impatient and tried something wreckless.This game's fairly easy, But not a cakewalk either. Stacked with the cheap price, You have very little to lose by purchasing this game. Why not buy it?			",77,12,0,7,2,0,3

I'm usually more pationt than that, but not with this game. Get it on sale just to experience the innovative mechanics, but be prepared to put it away after a while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is way to simple to be fun. It feels like a flash game anybody could have created if they looked up coding for a gravity that effects a character and objects. It doesn't even have a jump animation. The only ""good"" thing about this game is the fact that you can get cards worth more than the game itself is when on sale. I'm sorry to whoever developed this for the harsh review, but you really need to polish this. It feels more unfinished than some of the games that are currently in Alpha stages.			",83,10,0,11,8,0,7

												This is what I call a very good game. I found that the later levels are a bit on the hard side but it is still fun. The story is basic but good, the gameplay is rather basic but good as well. GAMEPLAYIt's pretty much like Super Mario with a slight twist.You have a gun that creates gravity wells and anti-gravity wells.The gun helps you through the levels.There are also different ways you can get through the maps as well.MUSICI think the music really matches the game, I give it a 4/5.GRAPHICSThe graphics are basic, nothing earth shareting but still looks good.OverallThis is a great game for it's price.It has very good gameplay, music and graphics.I recomand this game to anyone who wants to buy a cheap game on steam.

												Another indie puzzle platformer! ...and not a good one. It feels very cheap, a lot of the difficulty is just trying to do the same things over again until you get things positioned exactly right so that you don't die, and the ""Hard mode"" is more or less the same levels, just with half of your gimmicks disabled.I got it for 29 cents and don't really feel it was worth my time or effort. Meh.			",923,363,8,393,62,1,217

												Laugh at the simplicity, cry at the difficulty...funny situation for a little game I only got for the cards/badge. Actually found myself playing and laughing and enjoying it. Until the level right after the 2nd achievement. With the frame rate delay you hardly ever get time to move, fun kinda ended there. but perhaps with more work or luck you can get past it. Neat little game if that little thing can be corrected just a bit.			",424,68,5,71,85,2,150

												This is the perfect game for people who like everything and are easily impressed. There is some fun and satisfaction to be had solving these puzzles but other people will find them annoying and tedious. And the levels are unpolished. The world of Defy Gravity is not a vibrant world alive with colors and life or amazing artwork. Its a pretty drab place that made me want to kill myself the way it constantly reminded me I was wasting my life playing it.I don't remember the music. I didn't like the controls. I did like the way they didn't keep sending me all the way back to the beginning. If they'd done that I would have actually been mad so I thank them for that consideration. The price was right but I fear that someday soon I'll have a need for that 29 cents. I hope they use the money to buy some talent and good ideas. They are sorely needed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For such a cheap game it's practically a flash game, just decent.With that in mind it's not a bad game, just that the rules, such as only 2 gravity wells per jump and sometimes the game feels like it goes a bit too fast makes the game less than fun.Still, try it out.

												This is a rather nice puzzle game for a low price, except for one annoying bug. At the start of every level, the screen will be black until you shoot a gravity well. The screen will also become black randomly in the middle of a level if you haven't got any gravity wells out, which can be quite annoying if you're in the middle of a death-defying jump.Needless to say that I can't quite enjoy this game as I should. Until this bug has been fixed (which I understood the dev has been trying to figure out for over a half year now), I can't possibly recommend this game as it's more annoying than enjoyable.To show an example why this is rather annoying... in one of those levels there is a laser beam heading your way, and you have to get to the other end of the level as fast as possible. There are a rather lot of spikes on the floor and you have to jump with a floating platform and time things nicely. Now, imagine jumping with a hot laser beam on your tail and you need to be able to look where you are jumping off to, and suddenly the lights go out for no reason. Very likely you're going to die, and the screen stays black even when you start over. The hot laser beam, however, is still heading towards you in the restarted level and you won't see it until you shoot some random gravity well just to notice you're too late and died again. Rinse and repeat.			",987,514,42,197,143,15,253

												This game is impressively bad. There's a crashing-bug on the first screen unless you use command-line options to force it into windowed mode and disable the music. Once that's sorted out you find yourself in the midst of the kind of ""I made this in just 30 minutes"" shovelware that you'd expect to see with a low score on a flash games site. (NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION.) The controls are poor, the concept is moderately amusing, but very poorly executed. There's no storyline of any sort beyond the opening screen. The graphics are garbage.I felt like I should exercise some restraint in making harsh criticism, since this smacked of ""baby's first vidya gurm"", but then I got the trading card with the girl showing her cleavage, which I figured would be worth 5 seconds of amusement. Then I clicked on it to see the full-sized version and instead of showing the picture on the card it showed a gameplay screenshot.This is a troll game. Don't waste your time.This game goes on sale sometimes for $0.29 USD. The cards are currently worth about $0.08 USD, and you get 3 of them, so you can get this game for a nickel. It's worth about a dime less than that, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disregarding one of the worst bugs I've ever encountered in any game (black screen whenever the game loads or reloads until the gravity gun is fired even though the game is actively going), this game is really bad. It has some interesting ideas, and it's certainly not the worst game I've ever played. However, most student games I've encountered are better than this.			",148,24,2,6,16,0,23

												I would not recomend this game to anyone. My first reason being that the controls are absolutly terrible. My second problem with this game being the skill gap jump from the first 2-3 levels to the 3-END levels, It seems like it holds your hand till the end of the ""Prolouge""  and then drops you off into a levels that you may or may not be able to pass. Overall my experience was very bad, and I did not enjoy the game one bit.			",46,11,0,7,4,1,1

The object are everything but nice, the background is probably a random image from Google, and the walls...did you just copy the walls from another game, and took out the particles?2) Bad music. I never saw epic music...also bad, epic music...mixed with sime xx-bit sounds, probably MIDI if not xx-bit, and on a ""space"" game too.3) Easy to understand how it works...easier to understand how levels should be made. The hard part? The mouse cursor is useless. You have to wait for the right amount of time, and the job is done.			",77,11,1,9,2,0,7

												Defy Gravity is an action platformer that is a mix between classic platforming and gravity based puzzle solving. Kara, our heroine, has access to a unique gameplay mechanic that she uses to manipulate the world around her. She has a gun that is able to alter the laws of physics through the creation of pockets of gravity and anti-gravity. By mastering the use of these abilities Kara is able to augment her jump in order to almost fly past obstacles. These powers can also be utilized to move objects that block her path and platforms that Kara stands on in order to traverse the levels.			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

												Defy Gravity is a very short and simplistic puzzle platformer where you create gravity wells that either push or pull you. It's kind of like being in a magnetic suit and the gravity wells act as attractive and repulsive magnets. The gameplay is actually pretty good and the game does get progressively more challenging as you progress, but the early levels only take a matter of minutes to finish. I do like the old school feel to it and the save spots keep it from becoming overly frustrating.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Very low production values, but surely more than excusable for a game that costs $2.99 normally and is often on sale for $0.29. Other than that, a surprisingly clever puzzle-platformer that you can turn a profit from buying. :-)Very smooth difficulty curve and forgiving checkpoint placement make for an easy-at-first-but-deceptively-challenging game, though I didn't find it too hard. Many of the puzzles can be swiftly bypassed with some twitch skills, however.			",120,17,12,2,6,1,10

												It's good for your basic side scroller. Please keep in mind I got this at while it was $0.29. The controls are decent for the keyboard but it feels out of place sometimes imo. There is no settings/adjusting in game and basically you just have to deal with it. Also the levels are come off quite repetitive and it seems like it's the same thing over and over again but in the end I did enjoy it for the price it was and I was expecting a lot worse.

To my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed this game, as it reminded me of Portal and Mario. The game itself took me 4 hours to beat but the puzzles really made me think. I recommend this game if its on sale again.			",114,6,1,4,3,3,9

												When you take a glance at the game, most probably expect it to be boring or not worth their time. However, if one decided to buy it and try it, they'd see that the game is enjoyable and challenging at the same time.

												An amazing puzzle platformer hybrid that while having a few challenging levels is over all an immersive and relaxing game that is worth every penny. I picked it up at 90% off but would easily pay full price and feel satisfied with my purchase, my only gripe is that I wish they sold a bundle with the sound track, as it is just superb and I love it. This game is without a doubt a hidden gem, 9/10.			",114,19,1,12,6,0,22

												For $0.29, you can't go wrong and it's worth its price at $3 as well. It may not look the best, but its a solid game nonetheless. The cards arent selling as high as before, but you'll still make a profit if you buy it at .29. I'm not sure what causes the ""black screen glitch"" that other people have mentioned, but it didn't happen to me, and I had a good time with this game. Another example of gameplay over graphics.

												This is a fun little timewaster. A clicky platformer/physics toy, a little sloppy in terms of presentation (the screen just goes black in between lives, very jarring - maybe that isn't supposed to happen? :shrugs:[Edit: SCRATCH THAT - I have to Alt-Tab out and come back to the game to get out of the black screen so... yeah. Keep that in mind if the game is more than a buck) but the gameplay is cleverly designed and also fun, which is the most important thing, especially at this price. I got it for 49 cents, can't really beat it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I liked it.It's a very solid puzzle platformer with an interesting concept of little gravity holes that either suck you in or push you away, which of course are used to get from one end of the level to the other. They have names, but I forgot them.There's no story, but I wasn't really expecting one. I believe, though I may be wrong, that you're a heroine named Kara. I think I saw that somewhere anyways. In reality, it affects nothing, and the model for the character is in a space suit, so you can't tell either way. Does that take away from the game? No, I guess not, but it certainly doesn't add anything.I bought it while it was on sale for I believe 29 cents or $0.29, because why wouldn't you pay that much for a game? It took me a little over two hours to complete, both its normal and hard mode (which is unlocked after you beat the game one time) and it was fairly challenging at some points. The problem with this is that the puzzles that were challenging weren't beat by thinking, but by luck. Now, I don't normally resort to blindly going forward and hoping to get lucky often, but there were cases where strategically planning were out of the question; it just couldn't be done. This is more evident in the hard mode, where you will more often than not disrupt the path of flying projectiles to the point where they're completely scattered and flying all over the place.Another negative was that the soundtrack was unengaging. If I wasn't so lazy, I would have muted the game and used Spotify for my audio needs during the game. There are some points where you can go over the top of the level and skip the level mario-style, and I unashamedly used those when I felt as if a simple puzzle was beneath me. Lastly, the game seems to want to point out where exactly to put your gravitymajiggies for a good six or so levels in. That's quite annoying.Despite this, I still rather enjoyed the game, and I did gain a profit from the playing cards earned during the game. It wasn't spectacular, or even great, but it's good enough to not be a waste of time. And if you can net a profit off of it? Sure, go for it. However, if it's not on sale and costs $2.99, then I would look elsewhere.			",197,86,3,40,34,6,20

												At a certain point Defy Gravity warns you that it's about to become very difficult, and it isn't lying!  It's the kind of difficulty where you can see the light at the end of the tunnel and know how to reach it, you just need to hone your skills enough to be able to do so.  You're going to want to want to keep trying, and the designers here were smart enough to know exactly how to encourage that by providing unlimited tries, and a perfect check-point system.  If you've passed a section you won't have to do it again because you died on the next one.			",186,68,4,40,9,0,13

												Surprisingly neat! I made my thirty cents (bought during sale) back from the cards too, so an essentially free, decent game is alright in my books.None of the puzzles are extremely difficult, but some of them do require some timing. There's a hard mode after you beat the game that I didn't really try which could get excrutiating if you're adamant about getting 100% achievements. The physics aren't super finnicky like I'd expect, and it works mostly well. It's a hella indie game though and it shows just from the general lack of polish in areas; there were occasions where I died when I thought I shouldn't have. That's not too big of a deal and I'd say this is definitely worth your money during a sale.			",655,190,17,53,50,6,60

												I liked it.It's a very solid puzzle platformer with an interesting concept of little gravity holes that either suck you in or push you away, which of course are used to get from one end of the level to the other. They have names, but I forgot them.There's no story, but I wasn't really expecting one. I believe, though I may be wrong, that you're a heroine named Kara. I think I saw that somewhere anyways. In reality, it affects nothing, and the model for the character is in a space suit, so you can't tell either way. Does that take away from the game? No, I guess not, but it certainly doesn't add anything.I bought it while it was on sale for I believe 29 cents or $0.29, because why wouldn't you pay that much for a game? It took me a little over two hours to complete, both its normal and hard mode (which is unlocked after you beat the game one time) and it was fairly challenging at some points. The problem with this is that the puzzles that were challenging weren't beat by thinking, but by luck. Now, I don't normally resort to blindly going forward and hoping to get lucky often, but there were cases where strategically planning were out of the question; it just couldn't be done. This is more evident in the hard mode, where you will more often than not disrupt the path of flying projectiles to the point where they're completely scattered and flying all over the place.Another negative was that the soundtrack was unengaging.

												Bought it because it was super cheap and I could get trading cards. It reminded me of the flash version of Portal except you attract and repel yourself with gravity.Although you get many invisible checkpoints and enter lots of doors, I had no idea how many levels or how far I went in the game. I thought I was pretty close to beating it and then I got a screen telling me that the game was going to start getting harder. Didn't make it much past that part.Good sidescrolling puzzle platformer, bad graphics, decent music, wouldn't pay more than $.14			",73,11,1,10,11,2,13

For only 19 cents and you get up to 3 trading cards its near no cost and you cant make much wrong with it.Recommend this little funny game for those who have some cents in their pocket and dont know what to do with it well in my case it was like that.

												Bought it for 0,19 cents thinking i'll get any cards for profit but it actually is a pretty decent game. I played the game with a xbox controller but the controls were not too good (but good enough for a 2euro game). 10/10 (but not only for the profit :D)P.S. sorry if my english isnt too good.

												As this game has been released for more than three years, I would expect it to have a lot more polish than it actually possesses. There's no facility for adjusting the volume of sounds effects or music, and game controller support is limited only to the Xbox 360 controller. There are so many generic Windows game controllers available, and so many other games seem to have no problem supporting them, it's quite frustrating to find that this game doesn't. The game itself is based on a novel idea, and is quite fun. But the lack of expected facilities makes it lose that ""one-more-play"" feeling, unfortunately.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I picked up this game for $0.29 so I don't really have anything to complain about but even if I bought this game for full price I wouldn't regret it. Obviously this isn't a super polished game but it certainly does have its charm, the challanges start easy progressivly get harder. However I was a bit frustrated and disappointed to see that some of the later challenges require you to get you're timing and jump height perfect rather than making you acually think and solve the puzzles. Overall great game absolutely worth its price:  7/10			",51,1,0,2,4,0,5

												Oh well.""Defy the gravity!""They said.""It will be fun!""They said.Defy Gravity was one of the only games that actually made me quite mad. And I did not expect it. I wont make a long review for it, since it is very short and simple game.Defy Gravity is a little 2D platformer, where the player can make gravity, and anti-gravity wells, and progress through levels thanks to this. You will hear a nice calm chill music in the background, but you might notice that you dont give a single damn about it when you are trying to beat the game. The controls are simple, the game is catchy, but there is A LOT levels that are complete brainfart and require just alot of luck. Mostly the last few levels. But it is worth to play. I got it for 9 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cents on a sale, and I definitely cannot regret it. It is just one average game, but for the price, like please, just buy it on a sale.PROS:+ Simple+ Catchy+ CheapCONS:- Brainfart levels- Short (atleast it did not get boring though)- Last achievement is cancer to get. (Might be a Pro for people looking for a challenge, but I definitelly didnt enjoy it personally.)Anyways, hope you already bought the game, and good luck defying the gravity.			",161,20,4,22,11,1,11

												Bought this a couple of days ago as it was on a super special at just 9p. It has turned out to be a very entertaining game - enough so that my other half invested in it too. I'd like to leave a longer review but he's now beating me so I'll keep it brief so I can get playing and get ahead again.Decent graphics - perfectly sufficient for the type of game and they don't hurt your eyes like other recent 'retro' offerings.Interesting mechanic - you have two different gun powers (attraction and repulsion) which you can use to boost yourself across levels in different ways.Controls are simple. I do find this a little easier to play with the gamepad than with the keyboard and mouse due to slightly awkward key layout, but both are do-able.			",54,23,2,9,4,1,13

												The game progress from simple to complex in a very rapid pace. From maps that take minutes to those that take hours, this game is rather fun. Of course, your biggest enemy is your patience. Will you throw a tantrum after not gettign to that finish, or will you instead channel your energy to complete your mission the next time?Graphics are unimpressive, but this indie game is more focused on the few simple gameplay mechanics that when combined, give an almost limitless storyline options, and an infinite combination of ways to clear a level.In the end, I would recommend this game for its simplicity; it's a good time waster, so you may find yourself stuck on a level for hours... or days in my case. Yet, it did help me think more strategically and above all, stimualted me to think fast in very time-limited scenarios. A definite 7/10 from me.			",13,1,0,1,2,0,0

												I enjoyed this game far more than I thought I would. The game centers around the player's use of gravity and jumping and throws various puzzles at the player for them to navigate through. Some were pretty tricky and the game has a hidden hard mode should you complete it on regular difficulty. It's a relatively short game but it's a fun little brain teaser and is easy for anyone to pick up and play; well worth the price (especially during a sale!). ",470,231,11,79,65,6,95

												This has got to be one of the more enjoyable gravity games out there in the market. It has well thought out puzzle designs that truly test your brains and reflexes. The art direction isn't much to write about but that's okay because where it shines is in it's gameplay.You can finish the game in less than 2 hours but that doesn't mean that it is very easy. Every second counts as every moment is needed to be utilized in order to advance through the game's challenges. Defy your expectations, enjoy the gravity of fun this game has to offer; extend yourself to this wonderful game.			",568,261,10,108,49,3,151

												I'm sure I took a little bit longer than some folks to fully clear the game and all achievements, but even then it was only at 4 hours, so it's a relatively short game.That being said, it's challenging, occasionally frustrating, and a refreshing change of pace from so many types of platformers, especially since there is a vast array of paths and patterns to adapt and influence in each level, and those aspects are supported by good play mechanics and physics.Replayability is lacking once you make it through on the hard mode, but I wasn't expecting a game I could continue to go back to afterwards, so there's no disappointment for me on that score.At $1.99 regular price, which means it's insanely cheap during Steam sales, there's really no reason for anyone who has even a fleeting interest in platformers to pass on this game.

												I bought this during the summer sale when it was like, 27 cents.  I have to say, it's not what it looks like.  It is actually pretty good so far.  Looking at the previews, I thought it would be completely horrid.  However, it looked like they knew what they were doing with this game.  Although it isn't very much puzzle, it's definitely a good platformer.  And a challenging one at that.  I didn't feel like my intelligence was insulted, nor did I feel incompetent.  I may be terrible at writing reviews, but I know when a game is not bad;  this was not a bad game at all.  Would reccomend for people who like puzzles, but prefer platformers.			",63,7,2,2,5,0,0

												Short Review:You get what you pay for.Full Review:- Gameplay & ControlsDefy Gravity is a simple platformer where you use simple controls (WASD and mouse) and various objects to help you out, specifically one gravity sphere and one black matter sphere. Using these two spheres, you attempt to suck youself and navigate through a simple, and then challenging and later split-second-reaction-time terrains. There are no background story as to why you need to navigate through them or whatsoever, so it's just a linear puzzle game. The controls may feel a bit disjointed at times as you have to mash the buttons or else repeat yourself for a few more times.- GraphicsIt's rather simple and there's not much fancy graphics to it, save the cutscene (maybe). The menu and text are easy to read but also, again, rather simple. The background does not feel matching, et cetera, as you can probably notice from the game's screenshots itself.- MusicIt's simple audio effects as well. Nothing spectacular, distasteful or annoying.- PricingIt's cheap, in fact the trading cards you get costs more than the game itself. The plenty of reviews helps to concrete this evidence.- VerdictThere's no reason to not get it, though if you aren't a fan of these platform-jumping games then there's no reason to get it either. Or maybe you could earn a few cents from selling the trading cards?			",90,9,6,7,4,3,11

												Fairly simple mechanics, but paired with a difficulty wall that forces the player to figure them out almost instantly or be unable to progress in the game. Several levels require lengthy periods of precise platforming, where a single mistake causes you to lose significant progress.Only worth it on an extreme sale when you can sell the cards for more than you paid for the game. Even then, it's probably more enjoyable to Alt+Tab out and just do something else until the card drops roll in.			",296,55,8,30,21,3,39

												Fairly simple mechanics, but paired with a difficulty wall that forces the player to figure them out almost instantly or be unable to progress in the game. Several levels require lengthy periods of precise platforming, where a single mistake causes you to lose significant progress.Only worth it on an extreme sale when you can sell the cards for more than you paid for the game. Even then, it's probably more enjoyable to Alt+Tab out and just do something else until the card drops roll in.			",296,55,8,30,21,3,39

The catchy music, the basic yet challenging level design and the steady progression of difficulty from level to level all make it a well rounded stratagie/action game.

Seriously, it was like I would be paid to play this game. When I checked the store page of this game, the price was normal.But now to the game. It is quite nice platformer but I could only recommend it for casual players... I would say that challenge is close to minimal and the music along with graphics are boring. Physics are quite good. Reminds me a bit of Portal for some reason.Anyway, get it when it's on sale. It gets like -90% every time.			",142,21,5,7,13,3,19

												The only reason I picked up Defy Gravity was because its price was next to nothing (75% off on sale, for an already super-cheat game). I came in expecting nothing, since the few things I could find said very little if the game was good or not.I was pleasantly surprised to find a pretty competent platformer with some neat mechanics to it. It certainly has it's flaws, and is rather short. But, it certainly was worth it's cost, and is a pretty fun game if you can see past the rather old-looking graphics.(The trading cards you get from playing also cost as much as the game when on sale, so you get it pretty much for free)			",56,3,0,3,3,0,1

												As my first review, I'm happy to put it on such a wonderful game. Defy Gravity Extended is perhaps one of the best platformers I have played in my life. The challenging levels and the great music makes a great experience to play. The levels go from super easy, teaching the mechanics to difficult levels that require split-second decisions. The graphics aren't Skyrim-esque, however, they fit the simplicity of the game. The gravity wells and anti-wells allow you  to float, hover, and boost yourself across levels. The gravity based platforming really makes this game a wonderful thing to play. I do think the player model can be improved, as it doesn't have much to write home about. I also found a glitch that if you put both a gravity well and antiwell in a corner, and walk straight into the corner, you won't be able to control your character. To fix this, you have to use your gravity shield(makes you immune to the effects of the gravity wells you place down), or place a new well. Overall, I rate this game a 9.5/10, and it would be a 10/10 if the devs could improve the player model and the glitch I have found. I really recommend this game if you want a calming experience, or a challenging game. I think the devs should add in a level-creator, so players can make and share their creations. Once again buy this game, its very nearly perfect.			",74,6,0,12,5,0,5

												This game is absolutely unpredictable, the objects that kill you don't seem to follow the rules that you've established in the game and so they can't be followed by your mind. It is also really confusing how the wells work. The gravity well is supposed to suck you in, but if you go into it at a moderate speed, it seems to spit you back out at the same speed you were going in, and sometimes even faster. It's even worse that once you reach a hard level, you need to get past each section before reaching a checkpoint, and after trying the exact same thing, time, after time, after time, the only thing keeping you from rage quitting is knowing all of the progress you've made before then will be lost if you quit. I got this game for %0.18 and even then, I wish for my money and time back.			",61,7,0,4,9,0,7

												Great game 10/10*I bought this when it was on sale in august for 0.14, and i can say it was well worth itPositives: Great idea, executed it greatly. Really fun. buy it. seriously. its a good gameNegatives: The frames of animation that the character has, but when you are playing the game, you dont notice how many frames there are. Should be more levels. this game was great.Only thing i want now is an HD remake-ish for this game, and more levels. ",77,6,2,5,5,0,13

												I bought this game solely so i could sell the cards. I turned it on and walked away for awhile. the cards never came. I actually started playing in hopes of getting the cards so i can sell them. Ended up playing it because it was fun. Worth the 14 cents. Still waiting on my cards tho.			",72,13,0,18,4,0,9

												Positive review because it was fun and I enjoyed my time. I do, however, recomend only buying this game on sale. Read more for reasons.Possible reasons someone might want to avoid:1. Beat the game in 30mins!!! <full clear> Had to wait 2 more hours just to gain cards.2. Feels like a browser game you could play for free.3. Puzzles are not challenging.4. Hard mode doesn't have harder puzzles, but instead ties your hand behind your back and says 'Do it again!'...now I refer you to my first sentence!			",132,54,2,26,10,1,17

												I wasn't expecting this little game to be so much fun and addictive. I've died hundreds of times but due to clever checkpoints I couldn't quit the game. At first the game is a little hard to get used to, but once you mastered the right click - left click dilemma, the game becomes a great joy to play.If you're hesitating, I guarantee that you'll have fun after you get the hang of the playstyle.Graphics are decent, not pixel art which is a plus for me. Sounds and music are enough.Pace of the game is well adjusted. Overall, it is a fun game which has trading cards, so if it's on sale, buy without a second thought.			",57,17,0,6,3,0,3

												Defy Gravity is exactly what I look for in a game like this; It's challenging, but not too challenging; it's not super repetitive (it may be a little bit repetitive at times). Overall, it's a pretty good way to kill time and have fun doing it. The game's pretty short though, so I recommend waiting until goes on sale.

												Once I started playing, I couldn't stop. It was like it sucked the soul out of me, and as I spiraled into darkness, all I could see was this game. I spent the whole afternoon non-stop playing this thing!Pros:-SPAAAAAAAACE!!!!-Cool Concept and Ideas (Gravity Gun, Gravity Shield, etc.)-Variety of Obstacles (Lasers, Orbs - You get the idea)-Cheap! (Goes on sale often!)-Fun for its price! (I got 6 hours of entertainment. Game is much shorter than that in length. Played through it a few times)Cons:-Graphics/Animations are pretty bad.-Gets Very Repetitive (""Play every level again on hard mode?"" Take my soul, too, while you're at it.)-Overused Mechanics (After so many levels, new elements would be appreciated)I found this game very fun for its pricepoint, especially considering how much cheaper than the actual price I got it at. ($00.24?, dangit, could've got it for $00.14!) I'd rate it around a 5/10 for the genre, but 8/10 for the entertainment value I got out of it.			",191,15,0,12,14,2,2

												for 18p on sale (29c) I guess it's ok, but it says portal/megaman fans would like it... It's way too easy to be compared to megaman, there's a checkpoint after every obstacle and just because a game has a gun which can shoot blue and orange stuff doesn't make it like portal, it's hardly even a puzzle game! Also, it's not like it helps that it's drowning in glitches, most levels you can just skip by going over the top of all the walls! It could be a good game but instead it's an ok, at best, way to spend 10-20 mins. 3/10, don't buy full price, maybe buy on sale if you're bored.			",15,0,0,5,2,0,0

												Fun, simple, small ""puzzle platformer"" game. Main levels were simple and fast.Hard mode is rather hard (starts when you complete the game), since it lacks consistency - sometimes the ball will fly at one angle, at another time it flies under a different angle. Overall its complete-able once you figure things out and time your moves while you rush (and retry, like a certain runner game I have).Overall the game isn't too bad, but a few points were eyebrow-raisers.Music is good. Sounds - not so much.Story, or lack of it, was OK for a puzzle platformer.			",139,21,7,26,5,2,21

												Positive review because it was fun and I enjoyed my time. I do, however, recomend only buying this game on sale. Read more for reasons.Possible reasons someone might want to avoid:1. Beat the game in 30mins!!! <full clear> Had to wait 2 more hours just to gain cards.2. Feels like a browser game you could play for free.3. Puzzles are not challenging.4. Hard mode doesn't have harder puzzles, but instead ties your hand behind your back and says 'Do it again!'...now I refer you to my first sentence!			",132,54,2,26,10,1,17

												For 1,99€ you'll get at least 3 hours of entertainment. The soundtrack is very enjoyable, the map design is good enough and I couldn't see any bugs during the gameplay. Tricky at the beginning, but you'll get used to it. Pretty fun and pleasant.			",47,7,0,2,1,0,6

												The only reason to buy this game would either A. Buy the game to earn the cards and just pay 30 cents for the rest to get a quick badge. or B. Buy the game for 29 cents, sell the cards for 40 cents. Other then that, there's no reason to play. The game play was boring and not what most would consider challenging. I will say the music was good though, I guess i did enjoy that.			",169,29,0,30,13,0,18

												Feels good at becoming Master Gravitymancer, then realizes that the game just started to get hard...But in all seriousness, this is a good game. Some of the puzzles are pretty straight forward, and some are harder, which is fine because it would get disapointing to beat one really hard puzzle that you died on dozens of times just to realize that you have another one right after it. But some of the puzzles are hard to the point where it takes you dieing tons of times before you actually get past it. It is a fun game though, and at a sale price at $0.30 (might I note that the cards can be sold for around $0.10-0.30 themselves, so, profit?), this is a great small game that can take some time in finishing. The game has Portal feel to it, you get two different gravity ""wells"" which either pulls or pushes you and/or objects. The gun is somewhat strange, it looks like a old watergun that I used to own, but instead of shooting water, it shoots ""wells"" which can help you or kill you (although, technically speaking, a watergun can have the same results). Anyway, If this game were on sale I would recommend it.			",93,38,0,60,31,0,28

												I picked up this game dirt cheap during the sales. For £0.18 it was a bargain, the puzzles are entertaining and gravity wells are cool but there are some annoying flaws. The hitbox around your character is huge, sometimes the gravity bheaves in odd ways and the controls can sometimes be really frustrating!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pleasently suprised.  I bought it to get my girlfriend her cards to finish the badge so she could level up and actually sort of loved the game while playing it.  It's not a terrible game really and on sale what it was 0.14 USD?  Then with 3 card drops I had a profit made on the game.The puzzles aren't really hard but the end areas get a bit tougher and it can be a good little bit of fun.  If you want cards or badges check this game out, and if you're looking for a casual puzzle game check this out.			",57,13,0,17,2,0,2

												Is this game worth the $0.1 I spent on it? Sure.It was something to do for thirty minutes. It killed time.It's meant to be frustratingly hard, and it succeeds at that.Especially the ""Now redo the game again, on HARD MODE."" ending looks frustating.As you can tell, I didn't beat it. I played a few levels and gave up before the game had time to get under my skin. Then I watched some other guy beat it on YouTube.That's how you beat this game: The only winning move, is not to play....but sure, it's worth $0.1 if you're bored.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
