												Games don't scare me. Movies don't scare me. In fact, short of being dropped in the middle of the ocean or singing in public, there's not much I'm bothered by... except Amnesia. Why? Because in this game, I am powerless. I cannot fight back. Games like Doom, Resident Evil, Dead Space, etc.; They fail to send chills up my spine and make me squeal like a child because they made the mistake of giving me an arsenal of weapons and badass personality traits. Are Isaac Clarke and Claire Redfield afraid? Sure, and I don't blame them. But I'm not, because I look awesome and I can materialize various tools of immenent destruction. Those creepers waiting to pop-out from behind the corner aren't trying to scare me, they're sacrificing themselves to the God of Death! Amnesia, though... My tools are the world's worst lantern and a number of closets to hide in! I couldn't fight if my life depended on it, and it most certainly does. Well done, Amnesia; I haven't looked over my shoulder this much since I was 12.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The original indie horror game that started it all. If you are in need of a good scare with an incredibly creepy setting, and actual storyline, this is the game for you. I cannot stress enough how fantastically horrifying it is. This is mostly done through the constant needs to push forward to avoid the darkness chasing you, but the knowledge that ahead lies horrible monsters. You're sort of stuck in the middle and it leaves you with a sense of helplessness that I've never experienced before.			",357,184,2,52,41,4,43

												Whenever I feel nervous or anxious I play this relaxing game to calm my nerves. I especially recommend playing this before going to sleep as it will ensure a good night's sleep for you! The overall atmosphere of this game is very cheerful and bright. The maps are filled with great landscapes, ingenious architecture, and friendly creatures and characters. In my opinion it's exciting and constant entertainment for all ages and genders. A great game in every aspect and 100% worth the money! The only con is that a character known as 'brute' is sometimes very naughty.			",41,1,1,1,1,0,0

Amnesia: still the ruling king of horror gamesHorror games are a special genre. What scares one person to hell, could make somebody else just raise an eyebrow, or even come across as comical to yet another gamer. Opinions on what makes a good horror game do vary accordingly, but amidst all these discussions, there's one game that stands out: Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Almost everybody who has played this game, concedes that it is exceptionally scary, and thus succeeds wonderfully as a horror game.The first of the two Amnesia games, it was released just five years ago, in september 2010. It's not the first horror game by its developer, Frictional Games, who earlier made the Penumbra games, but it's certainly the title that made Frictional Games famous. With the hype around the upcoming release of Soma, yet another Frictional title, playing through their best known horror game yet only seemed appropriate, and long overdue.Actually I started this game already three times earlier this year, every time not finding the courage to move on after the first hour or so, out of pure fear. I only play this kind of games when it's dark outside, using headphones, in order to let them develop their full scaring potential, but with Amnesia: The Dark Descent this kind of approach just looked impossible. The past couple of weeks I finally found the courage to persevere (in complete darkness), but I was only able to play the game in small pieces, only half an hour or so on end, after which I literally had to recover.This may seem like exaggerated, but it's not. This game is by far the scariest I've ever played. Playing as Daniel, you have to re-discover who you are and what you're doing in a medieval castle somewhere deep in the German woods. As the game progresses, the story poses more and more questions, and only at the very end did all the pieces come together for me. But it's not the story itself that's particularly scary. It's the way the game puts the player in an extremely vulnerable position, without any means of defense (no swords or guns in this one!) and only some tinderboxes and a lantern as a means to progress through the increasingly unsettling surroundings.The game is by far the darkest I've ever played. Darkness is actually transformed into one of the game's defining elements: when standing in darkness, Daniel slowly but surely turns mad, and the only way to counter this is either to light some candles with the tinderboxes, or to light your lantern. Since lantern oil is quite scarce, I found myself constantly trying to save it as much as possible. There is a constant looming danger in the form of monsters, who are seldomly to been seen but impose terror upon the player by sound or just by thought. For when a monster finds you, it's almost surely instant death. The game manages to strike the perfect balance between slowly progressing episodes where I was fumbling around in the dark, hiding for monsters and looking for clues or letters, and some scenes where the only option was: run!It's hard to describe in words exactly why this game got so deep under my skin, though, because it terrified me on an even deeper level that has nothing to do with graphics or game mechanics. I think the theme of man turning into a monster even worse than any monster imagineable struck a resonating chord inside me. I found myself screaming out loud at times, mostly out of utter disgust at what was happening. The game had a very unsettling effect on my, and probably that's why it took me several tries to play and finish it. It's a masterpiece in its genre, yet to be trumped.Very highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart, nor for heart patients ",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

												A true classic and the benchmark by which all other horror games are judged.Amnesia is an old school horror experience where it is what you can't quite see that terrifies you more than what you can see. It puts you on the edge of madness and terror and keeps you there without ever pushing you to the point where it because mundane.The story is actually very engaging, with the protagonist being an Englishman suffering amnesia, stumbling around a dark castle searching for answers. But those answer are unlikely to bring you joy. However whilst the story is horrific enough, the true brilliance of this game is the way it injects you with a feeling of utter helplessness and despair. You never feel like you have any options other than to run and hide, and even those options feel temporary, simply putting off the inevitable for a little longer. And yet run and hide you do. And no game I have ever played has used darkness so effectively. It is both your best friend and greatest enemy at the same time. It will hide you from the terrors, but it will expose you to the insanity brewing in your own mind. So you flit from light to dark, never able to truly feel comfortable in either.Everything about this game works well to produce a true feeling of fear. The sound and the visuals are great and the game mechanics are actually very cool. Pushing and pulling items around, moving chairs in front of doors, it all works to give that genuine horror movie experience.If you like horror games this is a must have. And I dare you to play it at night, with the lights off and headphones one :)I recorded my full play through and you can watch it here :

												Similar to the Penumbra games, Amnesia: TDD is all about atmosphere and storytelling.  The biggest difference between the two series is that Amnesia does include more of the classic horror induced moments of being chased and hunted.  Not that Penumbra didn't have a bit of that, but I'd say in Amnesia, there were specific moments designed to inject some action.Overall however, the game is paced similarly.  I could wander about, sip some coffee, read my notes and mementos and take in my surroundings.  This may sound casual but what Amnesia succeeds in doing is creating a sense of dread.  Brennenburg Castle is a miserable place and rarely do you find yourself feeling too comfortable. When an enemy does discover you and then gives chase, it is probably one of the more scary moments I've experienced in a game.  The music, the blurriness of your view, the sound of the monster chasing you...not to mention, when you do finally get behind a closed door and find a hiding spot, you then get to watch as the door is violently brought down into pieces. All you can do is hope you're not spotted as you stare at the wall (there is a ""sanity"" element if you're new to these games).  IRL, I am guilty of some audible ""gasping"" during these moments.  During one particular chase I couldn't find an adequate path to get away from my pursuer and let out a frightened yelp that I am ashamed to even admit. Though, it is important to mention that I allowed the game to get under my skin purely because it was better that way.  I could have played it and completely steeled myself from letting it get to me (e.g. left the lights on, lowered the sound, casually approached the objectives), but what's fun about that?  For me, nothing.As far as the story is concerned, I felt compelled to move forward to find the next clue.  I could feel a bit of excitement (or perhaps it's better described as relief) every time I saw a new note to read or completed a puzzle.  Naturally I won't reveal any spoilers just in case someone does read this review. I must emphasize that this is not a game full of jump scares and over the top gore.  With that being said, there are some very disturbing scenes that you come across.  I walk away from this game still thinking about some of what I experienced. Not just from the imagery but the story in general. Per the recommendation from the developers when you first start the game, play with the lights off, don't worry about saving and allow the story to drive you forward.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												-Recipe for playing this game-Ingredients:-  1 cozy blanket (2 is also good)- 1 computer or laptop- 1 installed Amnesia game- 2 nice chairs- 1 Dark room- 1 willing boyfriend who has experience with the game- 1 pillow or stuffed animal to hug (or the arm of the boyfriend, but he might disagree about that when he got puncture wounds from your nails after the first jumpscare) Directions:1. Start up the computer, it may take a while depending on how good your system is. Use the startup time to go on a treasure hunt for the other ingredients. Also make sure that the room is dark enough.2. Persuade your boyfriend to play Amnesia. It could be that he declines, if so, capture him with a Pokéball. 3. Wrap yourself and the boyfriend in a blanket and sit in the chairs in front of the Computer.4. Now it's safe to start Amnesia, make sure you keep your distance.5. Let the boyfriend play it, specially when he is experienced with the game, just sit back and ask silly questions which he probably already gave the answer to but you were too spooked to listen.6. Enjoy! ",58,4,1,6,10,0,8

												A horror game masterpiece that takes away all your feelings of saftey and security and gives you two options. Run, or hide. This is an exceptionally unnerving way to play and will challenge you as fear grips you and you must think quickly on your feet to stay alive! Play at night, alone with headphones, or with a whole bunch of your sissy friends who can't stand horror anything! You will get laughs and screams and your experience will be bolstered if you have two or more people watching you play! Alone though,...late at night? Heh heh heh. That can get to you, especially if you're a little tired, but not so much that you pass out. :P If your mind is already vunerable in some way, this game will take down your barriers and screw with you. It has a lot of psychological horror to it, and some of it has absolutely nothing to do with the monsters and the darnkess that follows you.			",142,54,1,17,12,0,13

												The game that will make you crap your pants. At least I'd like to put it that way. The developers have always, in my eyes, succeeded in bringing a true form of horror. That, being defenseless and not knowing what you're about to plunge yourself into.The Game offers an eerie atmosphere in a Prussian Castle where the main character Daniel awakes after he drank a mixture that'll make him forget, hence the Title. You will however soon find out why Daniel chose to forget, and let me tell you, you would've chosen to forget too. Without any means to defend yourself you're being thrown into a dark, creepy castle full of Horrors that may (or may not) lie around every corner. Was that noise you just heard your mind playing tricks on you? Or was it something far more dangerous. I wan't to be honest, I could barely play the game for longer than an hour without suffering panic attacks, intense amount of fear and dread and lots and lots of foul language.if you're into Horror Games, don't let this GEM slip by. Many people said this game set the bar for Horror Games to a new high, rightly so. If you don't mind 1st Person and being defenseless, plunge into the minds of Daniel as he explores the Castle to find his true identity, what led him there and why he gave himself the order to murder someone deep down in the castle.There are also a lot of Custom Stories that can be downloaded and played at the developers forums.5/5, by any means. If you're a Horror fan and you haven't played/heard of this game yet, you shou-... MUST give this game a try.			",704,141,22,62,105,4,103

Posted: July 25, 2016
												After spending days thinking about what to write in this review, I finally have come to the conclusion that mere words cannot summarize this gem of a game. I could write tremendously long essays describing what makes Amnesia: The Dark Descent an unique masterpiece, but it's to no avail. One would have to play the game in order to understand its beauty and its charm...""Wait a second, I thought this was a horror game? ..."" . It is. It's a terrifying journey in its own rights, from start to the end. But I can't help it, the atmosphere of Amnesia is one of the most, if not the most refined one I have ever witnessed in a video game. The Brennenburg Castle is a truly memorable place. During the first half of the game, you will be exploring the highly architectural, yet haunting chambers, familiarizing yourself with the gameplay mechanics, the story of the main character and the lore. I'm not going to go into lots of detail about the second half, but I'll just summarize this part with a quote that I think fits it best: ""All good things come to an end."", as you will understand what the beautiful castle hides, buried deep within.The story of Amnesia: The Dark Descent does not lack at all in quality, but nor is it the most intriguing or most interesting. However, you may have to give the game a second playthrough to fully understand the lore. You're playing as Daniel, an archaeologist. The plot spawns after Daniel retrieves a strange, mystical orb from a tomb in Algeria. From that moment on, he starts getting nightmares and the people he interacts with end up brutally killed sooner or later, by a strange force. He realizes he's being haunted by this orb and that, in the end, he will end up dead too, so he decides to follow the instructions from a strange letter he recieved, signed by Alexander, baron of Brennenburg. Most of the narrative will be brought to the player by finding notes and bits of Daniel's journal, scattered across the castle, but there are also occasional flashbacks, which will give you an insight into what happened in various places, throughout your journey. Story length's neither too small or big. Expect around 10-15 hours of playtime, if you also want to collect every journal fragment. It's worth noting, though, that this game suffers from the replay value factor. I don't see myself replaying it anytime soon as there's not any content to it besides the main story. Then, you may ask, why do so many people still play this game? The answer lies in the great implementation the devs added to the game: community made maps, aka custom stories. These are (for the most part) completely new settings created by various people, with new stories and environments (they're made using Amnesia's original assets, so it goes without saying: don't expect something as fresh as a brand new game). There are hundreds upon hundreds of them, fairly easy to find on the Internet and there are also Steam Guides regarding which ones are worth your time, or even how to create your own one!Let's move on and talk about the sound quality. This is another element where Amnesia shines brightly. Music is fitting and the sound effects are top-notch. The monster's growl will make your skin crawl and when he spots you, a ghastly music will commence. But all in all, when there is nothing dangerous nearby, you will be surrounded by a charming melody, one that immaculately fits the game's vista.Graphics of this game are quite impressive for such a small team (at that time?). Of course, they cannot compete with big name's engines, but nonetheless Amnesia does look good and the visuals have never been an immersion-breaker. The optimization suffers in certain areas, notably places with many sources of light, where the framedrops tend to flutter. I do not have a beast of a rig, but my specs highly surpass the recommended ones on the store page. It's nothing of a big issue to me, though, and the FPS never dropped below 30.The gameplay is interesting, to say the least. I don't see often horror titles blending puzzles in such a non-intrusive way, like Amnesia does. The puzzle element is on point here, you will run quite often into trouble, doors needing keys to be unlocked, machinery that needs more power, escaping from narrow areas etc. The monsters are here to give you a hard time and will do their best to stop you from advancing. Unfortunately, one thing I did not like is that, for the most part, the enemies will unrender after a while. Thus, you may find a good place to hide and wait for the beast to just go away... I wish they would patrol the area instead.However, the puzzles are intelligent and non-repetitive. Sometimes, the answer is not as obvious as it seems, or it requires the player to read some notes, advance some more in the story etc.Another unique element here is the ""sanity"" system. Basically, staying in the dark for too long, looking at the monster or witnessing unexpected events will drain your lucidity, giving Daniel headaches and ultimately hallucinations, collapsing on the ground, allerting the monsters, along with different screen distortions. Always conserve your lantern oil, as most of the game takes place in dark surroundings. An interesting trivia, when your sanity is dangerously low, some elements of the game will change, such as Alexander's portrait on the wall paintings or some corpses appearing in various locations.The horror aspect is top-notch, rarely has any game made my heart beat this fast when being chased by the enemy. In Amnesia, you have no means of defending yourself. Darkness can be your foe, but also your best friend when it comes to hiding. The monsters are much faster than you, they can break down doors and detect you if you stare at them for too long. They're also very susceptible of sounds, so don't attempt to run past them without being seen. And under the worst circumstances, you have to make a run for the nearest chamber and lock yourself inside, alternatively using elements from the environment to block the monster from reaching you.Summary:Pros: + Magnificent atmosphere, the Castle of Brennenburg is a spot that will stick with players for a long time;+ Great and interesting puzzles, with original solutions;+ Immersive music and sounds, mixing ambient noises with heart-pumping melody, accordingly;+ Engaging storyline, may call for a 2nd playthrough in order to fully comprehend it;+ Terrifying horror element, you are completely defenseless in front of the monsters, they can chase you down relatively quick and kill you in a small number of hits;+ Unique system of Health+Sanity, in Amnesia you also have to take care of your brain status; witnessing unexpected events, staying in the darkness for too long will drag your sanity down and you will eventually collapse;+ Difficulty is balanced, the game will not throw its most dangerous enemies at the player until he's prepared to face them;+ Tons of user-made custom stories, that keep this game's player base alive and bring new, different concepts;Neutral: +/- The lantern runs out of oil pretty fast, which might prove to be a bother for new players, leaving them facing the darkness for a long time;+/- Dying has no real consequences; the game saves quite often and it will spawn you back in a safe chamber, along with the items you have retrieved;Cons: - No replay value; after you understood the storyline, there's no real point in coming back to it (besides the custom stories, of course);- Monsters disappear after a while, which massively takes away from the challenge factor;- Occasional bugs and glitches, aswell as sound stutterings;Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a king of horror genre and, by far, Frictional's peak game. Ultimately, we need more games like this.Personal rating: 97/100 - Masterpiece			",525,141,19,60,35,7,44

												I actually do reviews for games on Giant Bomb and PC Gamer... and one game I have trouble reviewing is Amnesia Dark Decent. It's not that I'm indecisive it's just, I can't find the proper words to ever describe this game. You couldn't possibly understand what this game means to me. You might like it and the horror genre would say it's a great game but to me it's more. This game single handedly restored my faith in horror games and got me playing them again. After Resident Evil 5/6 and after Silent Hill Homecoming and Downpour I stopped. Stopped playing, stopped reading up on, stopped caring about horror games. Resident Evil I saw coming but Silent Hill too? This mass appeal mindless action bullsh*t needs to stop. Survival horror was the genre that got me into gaming and then I saw the genre just up and leave us fans for more sales from the Call of Duty players. Action is where it's at? As the head developer for Resi 6 said ""Survival Horror games are no longer popular, we needed a new direction and new ideas"" well guess what... Amnesia proved Survival Horror still has plenty of new ideas to bring to the genre and proved that the genre is not dead.  Amnesia is art.... it's artwork crafted by brilliant minds. Look past all the fun scary chases and the jumpscares, just look at the game. A first person game that doesn't have weapons? Yeah imagine that. You hide and run from monsters, much like people would do in real life. But if you break down the level design, the choice of imagery, the methodically detailed environments. You will see true beauty within. If I may quote some negative reviews here ""water monster wasn't all that great of an enemy, he doesn't even have a character design. It's lazy...."" yes they had limited resources however this isn't lazy design choices. The fact that you cannot see the water monster is more terrifying than any other creature in the game. It plays off your imagination, the fear of the unknown. Your mind subconsciously filled the blank with your worst fear which gave this monster so much memorability. The water monster is one of the most memorable moments, everyone talks about it and that's the reason.  After such a horrifying experience with the water monster, what happens? You walk into a well light room with a fountain that supplies the calming sound of running water, a hole in the ceiling with light seeping through (one of the first times you see the light of day in this game), beautiful music plays softly in the background and the room has a tint of blue in the air. This is no randomly designed room, no this is a reward. This is saying ""Hey you made it through that horrible experience, breathe relax a bit. You deserve it"" and that is something I haven't seen before. No stupid achievement unlocked, no legendary loot, no high score and no misspelled CONGRADURATIONS. In a game that plays on your fear and emotions, they reward with such. They made you crap your pants, now they're making you feel relaxed. And that means more than any achievement.  The story is rich and it plays along with the tension in the game. The enemies aren't scary on the level of a jumpscare but rather the fear of being chased. Jumpscares are cheap thrills, true fear is much harder to achieve in a gamer and much more satisfying for the gamer. They accomplish this in many ways. Never knowing what danger lurks beyond the glow of your lamp, the dark abyss continuously hunts you down, the monsters are not just some scary looking monsters for the sake of ""boo look at me I'm scary"" they're people you tortured and sacrificed for your own safety against the darkness, their disfigured bodies are representations of the guilt you bare in the deepest parts of your conscious despite suffering Amnesia you still feel it, led astray by someone you thought you could trust, no escape or easy way out the only path is down and it's bathed in darkness as you descend slowly into your past with each step you lost sanity, walls are shaking, the crackling sound of your own mind is louder than your beating heart as you're chased by a horrifying disfigured creature you created, the sound of screeching can be heard when they're getting closer letting you know how close you are to death.  Oh... jeez I... I can go on and on about this game. Hell I want too... but if this gets any longer it will be considered a novel. The best thing I can say about this game? Play it... please. I beg you if you're a fan of horror games, if you like being scared, if you like a good story or immersion or hell if you just want to play a damn good game; play this game!  This is without a doubt my favorite game of all time. The favorite game, not one of. That's hard to say, but it's true. I never game 10 out of 10. I always made fun of other reviewers who did, saying no game is perfect. 10 out of 10 is saying it's the masterpiece of all gaming and cannot be improved in any way, shape or form. However, I've seen my mistake. You don't give it a 10 based on some score that means nothing to anyone else other than you. You're giving it a 10 based on the experience the game gave you. And based on that, Amnesia The Dark Decent was given my very first 10 out of 10.			",24,2,0,2,1,0,1

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of those games that only comes around once all of the planets in our solar system align perfectly - which, is to say, never. But yet Amnesia did come around, and it redefined not just the horror genre itself, but indie gaming as a whole, I think. It showed that first-person gaming fit the horror experience perfectly (in my opinion, even demonstrating that first-person horror is the best possible kind of horror), and with the right narrative and thematic techniques (in both writing and gameplay), could create a rich and beautifully dark universe for the player to inhabit. ... Assuming the player actually is bad enough to launch the game in the first place, that is. There's no two ways about it: Amnesia is one of the most terrifying games ever created, and that's as much a byproduct of its powerful and compellingly grim story as much as it is a byproduct of its grueling and sinister gameplay. At points you will be overwhelmingly afraid to continue playing, simply because every action and every moment you spend interacting with it, you realize more and more how powerless and incapable you are, and how little resources you really have. There is no combat in Amnesia - there is only survival, and it's as fleeting as it is difficult.It's not the game for everyone, but I think that all gamers should at least try to experience it; even the first half of it, if not more. It may take you months to accomplish, but a full playthrough of Amnesia can be one of the most rewarding and exhilarating experiences in the history of gaming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a first person survival horror game.The player takes the role of Daniel, who awakens in the darkened halls of Brennenburg Castle and as you start the game your memory is gone. Daniel is trying to discover hints about his past through reading notes that he apparently left for himself and searching through old diary entries and random scraps of paper. Hints are also provided by flashbacks that regularly pop up out of nowhere.In Amnesia there are no weapons. The only assistance you get is an oil lamp, some matches and if prefered the hints the game gives you. Also a nice and fearsome feature is your insanity. As you make your progress through the game you have to keep an eye on your sanity. If a monster gets close or you stay in the dark for too long, your character gets insane. The game also features some nice puzzles.Most part of the game takes place in dark areas or with some small lighting effects. The effects when your vision is blurred are nicely done. The sound is one of the games greatest aspects. The soundtrack ranges from ambient tunes to haunting sound effects like moaning or wind breezes. Or you hear footsteps and then suddenly some cockroaches are under your feet.Amnesia is a perfect horror game to play in the dark, alone and with headphones.If you are a fan of the horror genre you should buy this game.Sounds 9/10Graphics 7/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1592,618,71,238,229,30,272

												1) Turn off the lights2) Get good stereo headset3) Put on a diaper4) Immerse yourself and play the gameYou're stranded in a deserted (you wish) castle, trying to figure out who you are, following notes that you left to yourself. In those notes, you urge yourself to descend deeper and deeper into the castle, and while you do so, you learn the horrible truth of what is going on... slowly... slowly learn... equipped with an oil lamp and nothing more. The atmosphere is very creepy, and you have to care for your physical and mental health during the whole game. If you run out of light, you run out of sanity.There are many puzzles in the game to be solved, collecting objects spread around to unlock a door, and so on. They would be silly in a regular setting, but here you think ""Oh horror, do I have to go AGAIN in that dark, dark, dark room?!?!"" There are NO JUMP SCARES. You can usually ""feel the horror coming"" (and after coming; refer to item 3) and then you look... there it is... or nope, there is nothing. Or wait, there is. What was that noise? Where was that? Behind me? No, that things wasn't there before. DAMMIT I'M RUNNING OUT OF OIL IN MY LAMP!This game does a great job at making the player afraid of exploring some areas, just because you learn it could mean ""trouble"". Best horror game on Steam I have found so far. Unfortunately, there are no achievements.			",169,110,1,20,21,1,21

IntroYou want to feel helpless? Have that sense of adreline when you are faced by something that can easily overpower you if caught?I would recommend amensia to anyone who enjoys a good horror game that is geared towards making you scream.Summary+Great Atmosphere (Great music, Graphics, and theme)+Great Pacing+Great Mechanics +Good Puzzles Fear ItselfIt is so well focused on all the elements on horror that you are unable to even fight back at the enemy. Forever doomed to listen and feel terror down your spine as you try to find cover or some place to take shelter from the sight of the enemy. Another feature of this game to note is the idea of looking at your enemy makes you panic is quite genius. This allows for more realistic scare tactics such as quick glimpses of the enemy, and constantly trying to avoid its attention. IssuesWhile Amnesia is a good horror game there are some glaring faults with the overall game that could makes  the game lose the effectiveness of its horror. Continue reading at your own risk.PredictabilityThe issue stems from the predictability of the monsters spawning right after puzzles. Once you realize you're safe doing a puzzle you lose the tension and prepare even beforehand for the enemy to spawns by memorizing some closet locations. When a player sees the pattern the threat itself ceases to be horrifying. ConfrontationThe other issue is simply when players choose to confront enemies. Seeing the enemy also takes away to the mystery of what they look like and actually brings down the scare factor. Once they figure out how to trick the AI in more ways or simply stop being so afraid. The game design choices have been good to avoid this happening except for the fact that randomized monsters poof once you confront/die to them and you are pretty much safe till next puzzle.FlashbacksFlashbacks do not restructure the place to how it would look like before the guy had amnesia. It would be a better visual comparison to see how much the place suffered structurally as a result. Taking Control awayTaking control away from the player to demonstrate how the character feels at the moment I feel was a mistake. They do this a few times in the game instead of letting the player himself/herself react. For example in the start of the game when you hear noises above you, your character will fall to the ground with his face near it. I found this really overdramatic and not needed for the already well established atmosphere in this game.ConclusionOverall Amensia despite all the flaws that can occur, is a great horror game that tries its best to put fear in you and prolong the scare with smart tactics that are not blatent jump scares.

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of the scariest games i've ever played. It's not because of the amount of monsters, either not the jump scares (Fortunately they don't exist in that game). You wanna know what one thing making this game a true masterpiece? I'll tell you, imagination.Most of the times we are scared, because of things that are simply happening, like for example self-opening doors, windows, creepy screams from the basements of the castle etc. In that situation you immediately think that there is monster nearby, but you just realised that was a false alarm. You can also hear monster's scream, but that doesn't mean that you'll even spot him. Of course all those ""warnings"" aren't always fake alarms, so player have to be prepared in every moment! It's also a great survival game, you have to looking for items like oil to your lamp, tinderboxes to set fire to torches for example and other items that will help you complete this adventure!Soundtrack is great, it fit in game perfectly. In my opinion soundtrack in every games HAVE to be good, especially in horror games. I recommend check some tracks on YouTube.Game has also an option that allow you put some custom stories created by fans (There are a lot of cool maps to play). Also remember that some of the custom stories were making ""for fun"" and they aren't scary at all, but still worth to play a couple of them, no doubht about it. So if you completed the main game and You still looking for some cool, scary/fun stories to play, go ahead.I should also say about the physics in this game. You can pickup almost every items you spot, chairs, boxes, bags etc. You can compare that to Half-Life 2, but in Amnesia this one is more advanced.You should complete this game in 6-8 hours on the first playthrough in my opinion. I recommend looking for as many items as you can spot, since the inventory is unlimited. There is also one small addon called Amnesia: Justine, it's very short (1 hour) but in my opinion still worth to complete.I rate this game 8/10 (Very Good), not 9/10 because it's scripted game and you won't have same fun playing this game second time since you'll remember a lot of things.I didn't say about everything, story in game and other things, but this is my first ""big"" review. Also my english may be not perfect, but I did my best and i'll improve myself in future for sure!Buy it!			",182,36,3,15,6,3,34

												I had never experianced immersion until I had played this game. I had always sat in front of the screen as events unfolded in front of me. This game was different. I didn't just play the game, I WAS Danial. I felt the fear. I felt the confusion. I felt Amnesia. Everything that happened in this game, I felt like I had done. It struck me to the core. It gave me nightmares. It made me question my own humanity. How can a human being be so terrible I asked myself. Play this game to find out!			",78,10,1,6,7,0,5

												★★★★☆ - ""Worth your time, give it a bash"" PROS:- The enemy in this game is monstrous, everything about it is terrifying.- An interesting story told through minimal cut scenes and notes.- Creepy environments which you can roam around, each very atmospheric with superb lighting and design.- Restrictive gameplay means you interact only with objects, this adds to the tension as you can't fight back but only run and hide.- Amnesia is just one big puzzle game, one that doesn't hold your hand and is very challenging. You learn by dying and by reading, listening and experimenting with objects.CONS:- As you can only interact with objects I would have liked to had seen more of them, some rooms feel repetitive and if they were to be more dense it could have only added more character.- A tiny complaint here are the loading screens, as you enter certain areas there are loading screens, they are overly long but as you play more there become more. On a positive note it doesn't distract too much away from immersion as its all just one big place too explore.VERDICT? A very tense experience, not for the feint hearted nor the impatient but a rewarding and intriguing game.			",78,19,2,4,3,0,1

The only thing we have to fear is Fear itself. -Franklin D. Roosevelt***As a small disclaimer toward this review, though I do not have many recorded hours through Steam for this game, I typically had played it offline and have progressed much further than my online hours would anticipate. Also, I would like to give thanks to Demo_187 and Brother Tasty for proofreading this for me.Horror game fanatics of many generations know this title to be one of the most influential in the genre. Amnesia: The Dark Descent -commonly referred to as, simply, Amnesia-is a first-person psychological thriller set in an aged castle-like structure. The player ventures through the massive compound without memory of previous events with the hope of departing said area, never to return. This title is certainly becoming dated, but frets revealing this with its unique exploration approach to gameplay, as well as the ominous theme that persists.Here are a few points of interest in this engaging title:Atmosphere - Amnesia, unlike other recent horror titles, utilizes much more sophisticated means of psychological disturbances in comparison to the usual mirage demonstrated by jump-scares. As expected, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is quite dark, to the point that extended exposure to dimly lit rooms drains Daniel’s-the protagonist-sanity; this causes the player to expend light sources such as the portable lantern and tinderboxes to illuminate the area. Violent screams and ominous groaning aide in this title’s atmosphere, as these auricle displays may or may not contribute to the actual game experience in ways other than overall feel; whether or not such sounds are relevant can only be determined through play. There are few disruptive sequenced events since each offers context to the game’s illusive story, and Daniel has created a few “Note to Self’s” for the player to find that only add to the unsettling unknown.Story - As stated, this title’s opening entails the protagonist awakening in a seemingly uninhabited structure with no prior memory of interactions within. From here the player must quest through the house to uncover its secrets. This title-fittingly-is very psychological, maddening even, as the tale is surfaced only by exploring the massive home to horror. Just the right amount of information is revealed through playable scripted events and texts, but the full story remains outside of the player’s reach unless portions of this illusion are pieced together; even so, some questions remain unanswered to service some ambiguity. So as to not reveal anything of major importance, I will halt this segment with these final words: search well.Trivial Gameplay - Combat-apart from flailing chairs and other loose objects at unmentionable daemons-is nonexistent. Amnesia advocates primarily as a puzzle mystery game in which player must resolve encounters with cunning rather than physical prowess. Challenges are crafted well enough to accommodate Dungeons & Dragons  campaigns while retaining a similar theme to a remainder of the game. As for the controls, players maneuver with the standard W, A, S, and D key layout while also adding giving simple commands for lifting objects, illuminating wall- and table-mounted torches, accessing in-game menus, and equipping items such as the lantern; it is a simple system, but this sort of title requires no such complexity in having to remember an obscene amount of button combinations.TL:DR - Challenges range in difficulty from moderate to complex, with an intense atmosphere throughout. Amnesia is best presented in a dark room while playing alone and utilizing a decent sound system. Uncovering journals, I realized how much I did not know, but also that this most frightening revelations could possibly be recurrent or relevant to the current protagonist’s stride; this game truly knows how to disturb the player. I highly recommend this title to anyone that enjoys explorative mystery, puzzle, or horror titles from the first-person perspective. In my honest opinion, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a legend in the horror genre, so I would not pass on this title. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews?

												""My name is..............my name is...........Daniel"" and that's the start to this dark and totally engrossing horror game that grab's you by the scruff of the neck and refuse's to let go of you until you have finished it and seen all the horror's that it has to offer.This is one game i had on my radar for a long time and one i had heard a lot about,either written or from friend's who have played it and the word's ""CLASSIC"" and ""GENRE DEFINING"" have been mentioned on more than one occasion.But i allways take this with a pinch of salt and allways make up my own mind,but trust me when i say that the two phrase's that i just mentioned dont do this game justice as it is both of these and so much more.Amnesia: The Dark Descent - Trailer - YouTube

You start to play not knowing much other than your name and that for some reason you are here to do something that will affect not only your life but that of other's as well,and as the game progress'es you will come to learn not only the nature for your being here but that of the scream's that haunt the castle you find yourself stuck in.And that's all i will say on the story of the game as you should find the secret's this game hold's and the many twist's it take's on your own as nothing is more horrifying or scary as not only hearing but witnessing these thing's for yourself first hand instead of after the fact.The graphic's may look a little dated but trust me when i say they do their job perfectly when it comes to the scare factor and the things you will see not only make you jump (some jump scares in game) but also repulse you as well.The sound and music in game is top notch and really help's in setting that ""OH MY GOD"" type atmosphere that a lot of games like this seem to lack,this is down to the work of the composer Mikko Tarmia without who's music the game would (to be honest) not have the impact it does.He is currently working on Frictional Game's next project SOMA which i for one am waiting for with eager anticipation!!!!Amnesia The Dark Descent - Soundtrack - (Mikko Termia) - 04

All the spoken dialogue in game is delivered to perfection as well by the voice cast and some of it just has to be heard to be believed as to how good it actually is (and for a game like this that's all about delivering a powerfull story that's what was needed,not some half baked ham handed attempt-""HAMMER HORROR"" movie's anyone).The gameplay range's from puzzle solving (finding items that are laying around in the castle) which can be quite frustrating as some puzzle's can be quite offbeat to running and hiding from the monstrositie's that pervade in this dark and forboding castle from hade's (a lot has been said lately about game's using this mechanic but here it suits the game and makes it more nerve wracking to play).Amnesia The Dark Descent: Closet Hiding! - YouTube

			Its stupid how SCARY this game is :O		

Now i have said this on occasions before but i like it when developers take a leaf out of other medium's and this game was no acception,you can clearly see that a certain ""MR LOVECRAFT"" has had some bearing on this game as it is yet another story that would not look out of place on his resume and one that was at once a joy to play and also horrific to be a part of at the same time.So would you like this game and the answer is yes if you are looking for a classic and one of the best game's the horror genre of games has ever had to offer but if you are not one for this type of game and want something a little more action packed instead of full of story and an interesting and horrific tale then i would look elswhere.And remember ""THE DARK ONE'S ARE ALLWAYS WATCHING,ALLWAYS""(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEOS PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS AND ARE THEIRS BY COPYRIGHT)			",2026,1186,31,262,147,8,210

Plays game for 2 hours; getting lost in the fantastic story, solving puzzles, evading monsters and fully absorbing the creepy, immersive atmosphere.  Pshhh, nothing to it...5. Falls into water area.

												Your enjoyment of Amnesia: The Dark Descent hinges almost entirely on what you expect to get out of it.As a horror game, certainly what it’s advertised and probably considered by most to be, it shockingly comes across as rather...uninteresting. It does an amazing job setting a tense, foreboding atmosphere, layering on copious amounts of disturbing exposition and twisted imagery. And then sort of throws it away when it attempts to bring it all to boiling point and scare you out of your wits, relying on a sluggish, rather dimwitted monster which is rather less than frightening and scare tactics which all too quickly become  predictable. The sense of dread I felt when I first awoke in the mysterious castle that makes up Amnesia, was lost after just a few hours, as it became dreadfully easy to guess exactly when and how the game would attempt to scare me, no matter how much I kept hoping that it would reject my expectations. Picking up key items, opening a particularly unappealing door, or finding a note; Amnesia’s list of triggers is short and used liberally, making for an experience that quite frankly left me a bit annoyed at how little it managed to get to me. I was practically begging to be scared by the end, but aside from a few very brief standout sections Amnesia almost does more to set you at ease than it does to freak you out. I say all this, and yet, Amnesia is still immensely compelling as something completely atypical of what I would have guessed: a traditional adventure game. Behind the gruesome imagery and very effective atmosphere, the excellent puzzle designs and exploration were what kept me intrigued and wanting to come back to the game. Though they’re often simple in design, there’s a rewarding logic to each puzzle that makes them unexpectedly enjoyable to solve. Frictional Games manages to make blind exploration and continual backtracking interesting and continually stimulating, with each area you visit being visually distinct and engaging, and often holding within contextual exposition that creates a great sense of place and causes the castle to feel far larger than just the areas you explore.When you’re not solving puzzles, the disorganized narrative compels you forward, leaving you vague notes that give just enough information to make you want to learn more while rarely telling you the whole story until the very end. Finding the details of this plot are often disturbing and thoroughly unpleasant, leaving me feeling rather mixed about my protagonists actions but nonetheless complacent as I couldn’t leave this story unfinished. The flashbacks/hallucinations that your character often witnesses gives a look into how the castle used to operate, horribly inhumane and driven by some mysterious supernatural element, but all the same a place I wanted to learn more about if only so I could make sense of my character’s madness.This madness is perhaps the game’s strongest achievement, distorting the world around you and causing you to see things that may very well not be there. Staying too long in the dark wears on your sanity, requiring you to ransack every room you come across so you can be sure to have enough oil for your lantern and tinderboxes to light candles and torches. I was a bit disappointed that these resources came in such large supply, as it made darkness less of a threat and more of an occasional hindrance to your view, but the mechanic was still engaging enough to cause me to pay more attention to the environment and as a result find things I may otherwise have missed.It’s a little funny to me that despite being let down by the aspect that I expected would have prevented me from even finishing the game, what I found underneath it proved more than enough to push me through the game. If you’re hoping Amnesia will leave you terrified and sleeping with the lights on, you’ll most likely be let down by the underdeveloped, somewhat lazy frights found here. But if you can appreciate the game without those prerequisites, there’s an eerie and twisted adventure game waiting to swallow you whole into its brilliantly realized darkness.

												I bought this game near release, full-price, and still have not completed it. I am a 30-year-old man and I am too scared to play this to the end. I am currently making another go at it, let's see how it goes, because the setting and plot seem amazing.This is not intended to be one of those humorous reviews where people exaggerate for thumbs up, I am literally terrified by so many things in this game that I find it nearly impossible to play.

												Are you looking for a game that is different than all those other horror games out there? Well, you don’t need to look further; Amnesia: The Dark Descent is that game. This game is truly horrifying, unlike most horror games out there, Amnesia isn’t a horror game that is full of cheap jump scares. Amnesia: the Dark Descent is that game you shouldn’t be focused on playing the game to win; you should be focused on being submerged into this big, dark, and petrifying world. Amnesia’s scares are ones that last, making your hands shake and evermore aware of your surroundings. These long lasting scares, however, are evenly put out with the unique puzzles in the game. Nothing ever feels better when you solve an elaborate puzzle, and move onward to the next. You cannot fight your enemies; you should either run like hell, or hide. From solving puzzles, dodging monsters, and keeping an eye on your sanity. Every chamber just takes you ever deeper into the abyss of what’s called Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Is the Main Story too scary? Or are you bored of it? Don't think that you're done yet, because the horror doesn’t end there. You can go online and download custom stories, made by users to scare other users and to make the Amnesia experience a better one. 10/10Definitely worth the purchase for you horror game players			",46,14,0,2,1,2,1

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Is still one of those very scary games that I play or 'use' to play because... instead of relying on jumpscares, it realies solely on your psyche. Never play this game in the day time and without headphones. To get a real feel of terror: play it in the dark, sound turned up and with headphones on.I won't spoil the story because the game's centeral focus is to scare the living crap out of you. And the game does that, while most will say ""what's the big deal. It's just sudden flashes of paranoia, etc"" first of all, this game takes place in a creepy castle which some of you are probably eye-rolling but that actually made the game, back in it's day, the best thing about it. It's creepy, barely lit. There are sounds everywhere and nowhere. You have to rely on a lantern. Heck, some go pro and actually play the game without using any light sources. Plus like I previously mentioned it heavily deals with the psyche, what you see or may not see in front of you, etc. I can go on and on. This game still stands as one of the best horror PC games to get for the horror fans.			",95,27,0,34,11,4,25

												I was chased by an invisible water monster. I threw a bible at it and the creature bled.10/10 - Would throw another bible to induce bleeding because IF IT BLEEDS, WE CAN KILL IT!Jokes aside, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an atmospheric horror game. Like the advice recommended upon starting the game up for the first time, you do not play to win. Rather, you play to survive. There is no difficulty setting and there are no quicksaves whatsoever, just the usual autosaves and the ability to save once to exit the game. This allows players to not worry too much on when to save and focus more on survival.The sounds in Amnesia have been worked very well. Upon playing in the dark with headphones, the immersive abilities of the game kick in. The constant echos in the stone castles or creaks on aged wooden planks remind players they are in an ancient castle where help is so far away. Literally, the only way to be comfortable for a moment is in a properly confined room with a lit candle...or the closet. Why the closet? Well, there are enemies in this game...and they are legitimately scary. Hardly anything competes against their hideous apperance and merciless intentions to seek and kill you. I dare you to stare face-to-face at a humanoid being who has reptile eyes and its lower jaw has been detached from its face. Oh and, it hates being stared at because if it sees you, it will try to slash you. There is almost no way to run if such an encounter occurs. Just throw something at it to stun and then run like hell. Or, if you are lucky, hide in the closet and beg for mercy. When the monster attacks you in the closet, you will know sh!t hit the fan so hard, it's everywhere and out of control. Why are there no weapons in the game? Having even a knife would ruin the scare factor and the game would not be so scary anymore. While avoidng enemies, exploration is the key to find essential but quite rare items. Light (and typically the closet) is your best friend but the lantern consumes so much oil and jars of it is so rare, nothing can make you happier if you find one. There are tinderboxes to light up torches and candles but beware. They cannot be put out unlike the lantern and you really do not want to be in a well lit room when a monster comes in growling. Of course, it would seem like common sense to not use the lantern and lit up dark areas. Upon doing so, your sanity can be drained faster. At the lowest level, it then works against you and cannot be repaired or reverted when trying to stare at a lit up candle, only nullified. At high insanity, hallucinations take over and can appear more often than the real threats and your movement and literally stop. This leaves you helpless...especially when a monster is nearby and you need to run or hide. As such, making progress, such as finding an quest related item, is the only thing to help the poor soul of Daniel.Who is Daniel? He's an unlucky chap who was pulled into this mess. Avoiding too many spoilers, he decided to drag himself into an ancient castle and after terrible events, Daniel must pull himself together and kill the person mostly responsible for his predicament. He can't leave the cursed castle until this is done. As such, to learn about his past which he erased from his memory, there are notes scattered about and flashbacks that depict the horror before the game starts. In a way, this breaks the fourth wall because reading them helps to soothe the player's paranoia in the real world upon playing the game for so long!Eventually, the main storyline/campaign gets boring when one memorizes where the monsters spawn and such. Thus, the game introduced the wonderful feature to install custom stories. Some of them, which, are even more terrifying than the base game. You've been warned.The only complaint I had was some of the gameplay features. Closing and opening a door, for example, takes some getting used to. Instead of pressing ""e"" to interact, one needs to press ""use"" and then use the mouse to open it at a desirable speed. Thankfully, there is some time to practice that at the very beginning of the game.In conclusion, these traits are what many games and movies lack, especially Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. Thus, I highly recommend Amnesia: The Dark Descent who want a refreshing horror experience.			",112,9,1,12,6,1,8

												A rather well done adventure horror game that deserves playing if you are a fan of either genre. The puzzle dynamics are a little quirky in places and can be misleading but overall they are straightforward and easy to solve. There’s no combat so all you can do when confronted with an adversary is to run and/or hide but it serves to heighten the effect of how helpless you are when subject to these supernatural forces beyond your grasp. The audio and art design are well suited to one another and deliver an excellent environment for feeling the dread of the unknown as you thread further into the depths where your destiny awaits. So fear or no fear… this game deserves mustering enough chutzpah, guts, gumption and whatever else you got to spare in order to play.			",2198,857,88,271,225,28,362

												Amnesia : The Dark Descent is a blend of adventure game elements such as exploration and physic based puzzles in a horror themed environment. They complement each other well, as the places you wander through get gradually more terrifying, the fairly unconvoluted riddles help you ease the tension that can become almost unbearable at times. This is where this game shines, the pace is skillfully mastered, even if you have difficulties persisting in horror games you might very well finish this one. The design is tighly knot around exploration, lightening candles and torches to ward off the darkness, finding the scattered pieces of the story and a death mechanic inconsequential to your progress. The game manages to fill you both with a sense of curiosity as you descent further into the abyss to unravel its mysteries, and a sense of dread to what awaits you in its darkest recesses. You won't be disappointed by its climax.Amnesia : The Dark Descent is a very enjoyable and rewarding experience, yet a highly unpleasant one, reaching that difficult balance each horror game aims to find. It lasts 7 to 8 hours, and there is the possibility to play custom stories, which I might review here as I go through them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've never gotten more than 2 hours into this game, and played it 2 times for a total of 3 hours. I'm not a fan of horror games, and Amnesia: The Dark Descent is all types of wrong for me.  But at the same time, I recommend it because if you like being anxious, if you like being scared, if you like a horror game, this is for you.  Amnesia does away with jump scares and instead mucks with visuals, and gameplay.  The player is (at least as far as I saw) not given a weapon, instead he has a lantern to brighten up dark places and see.  This is good because if it's too dark, the players sanity will go and can only be recovered by ""progressing"" in the game or solving puzzles. The entire game though understands horror and works towards it.  There's happy shiny moments (at least in the first two hours).  There's no gardens or happy sunlight.  Everything in this game is atmospheric and created to make you uneasy.   From a slight camera tilt, to a blurry view, to evil sounding ""memories"" to writing that's just... unnerving.  Nothing jumps out as ""SCARY"" but everything adds to that feeling. This is pure atmospheric horror and brilliantly dome. I'm not someone who has anxiety problems normally but holy hell, this game had me freaking out after only the first hour this time.  I turned off the game and I won't be back.  However that's more a personal issue, if you want TRUE horror, if you want to be scared and to be filled with dread, Amnesia The Dark Descent is for you.   Just don't play it around me, please.

												If there was any game I could wipe from my memory as to experience it anew again and again, it would be The Dark Descent. Despite having a thousand let's-plays on YouTube for every hair on your head, I still believe this game is hideously underrated. Amnesia: The Dark Descent has nailed down the most important quality in any horror game in a masterful way that I have not seen since Resident Evil 4, and that quality is that the fear associated with gameplay is carefully trickled into the player's head through the musical score, voice acting and environments.The voice acting is tastefully theatrical, yet believable. Sam Mowry's talent as the voice of our antagonist goes a long way toward paintaing an image of a formidable, developed foe. Richard Topping's voice as the protagonist potently reflects the player's fear while still managing to pull us into a false sense of safety in the game's many story flashbacks (oops, spoilers!), before shoving us back into the crucible of terror that is this game. The graphics are as enjoyable as they are cohesive. As mentioned in the commentary playthrough available to the player, a great deal of consideration was invested in assuring that the visual elements of the game would add to the experience. I will omit detail on the topic for the sake of avoiding spoilers.The ominous nature of the musical score is unparalleled. Whether the environment was meant to instill a peaceful mood in one of the hub levels or to generate a horrifying ambience to leave you looking over your shoulder in your own home, it does it right.This game is horrifying and beautiful. Synonyms to be sure... if you're a true horror fan.Easily a 9 out of 10 game. Avid horror fans have no excuse not to purchase or wishlist this item. Those who are rightfully skeptical of the horror genre as a whole have the entirety of my enthusiasm: Give this game a shot.			",62,10,0,16,3,0,0

 ""To him who is in fear everything rustles.” Amnesia: The Dark Descent lives up to its title in providing a captivating gameplay and intriguing storyline. The music and sound effects complement each other perfectly, enhancing the immersive horror atmosphere within the ancient castle walls you travel, while solving puzzles. As already introduced in the Penumbra series of games, your only means of defense are hiding, running or using the environment to your advantage, leaving you with a sense of helplessness on your journey of self-discovery.  Trivia: With more than 1.4 million sales Amnesia: The Dark Descent represents the biggest financial success of the Swedish video game company Frictional Games. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.

												I actually completed this game tonight. I have owned it for 5 years, and started it now and again, but got only so far and then thought ""well, thats enough for me"".Well, I braved it. I said nope, I'm doing it this time. And I am bloody glad I did.Despite being 6 years old now, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is still a solid, good looking, great sounding, first person horror game. You wake up in castle with no recollection of where you are and why you are here, but you soon learn more as you descent further into the deep bowels of this forbidden place. Along the way, you have some relatively simple puzzles to overcome, while the odd puzzle or two present more of a challenge. And it is true what they say, this game is just plain scary. I truly felt fear in this game like no other game has accomplished, and this is achieved by a combination of jumps, creepiness, fear of the unknown, fear of being chased, panic, a gloomy atmosphere and some utterly brilliant audio work.I can't describe the gameplay and the mechanics without underselling the game at the same time. The only way to know what it is like is to just play it, and trust me on this - it really is one of the scariest things you'll play.Highly recommended.			",145,39,10,21,27,1,74

												HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!I swore I would completely finish the story before I wrote my review, but there were so many moments where I was like: ""I GOTTA GO WRITE A REVIEW RIGHT THIS INSTANT! I AM TERRIFIED OUT OF MY MIND!"" This served as a good excuse to quit the mind-boggling and constant-need-to-pause-the-game terror I experienced, but I did it. I perservered. I completed the game, and waited to write my review. This game... oh my god, this game.PROS:++amazing storyline+challenging puzzles+good graphics for an older game+great voice acting+scary as balls+custom stories made by the community+makes you contemplate Daniel's decisions+++THE ATMOSPHERECONS:-soiled trousersI bought it at full price and thought it was well worth $20, but if it's on sale as you read this, you absolutely have got to pick yourself up a copy. Truly astounding. A complete playthrough took me about 10 hours (with a little help). It'll probably take a little longer if you try and work out everything without any community help. After you finish the main story though, there are community-made custom stories that are very high quality, and I plan to check those out.

												Amnesia: The Dark DescentYou wake up inside the Brennenburg castle, unable to remember anything other than your name, and that you must kill Alexander of Brennenburg. This ""man"" has done unspeakably horrible things to innocents. It is this hatred and lust for revenge that will drive you, Daniel, to descend into the darketst pits of Alexander´s castle and eventually, your own mind.     Alexander´s ""pets"" roam the halls of Brennenburg and are up to kill you at any instance. You cannot fight back. Your only chance of survival is to run and hide. There is also the mysterious Shadow hunting you down, a supernatural being that wants an object you posses...Amnesia is my favourite horror game of all time, and one of my favourite games of all time. You have probably heard of this masterpiece, especially if you used YouTube at the start of the 2010´s. I remember watching the walkthroughs and custom stories from many great YouTubers, such as PewDiePie, Markiplier, Lakko. I fell in love with the game, and this Winter Sale I decided to finally buy it for my own.I have not played that many horror games in my life, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is this scary. The astmosphere is crushing. As mentioned before, you cannot fight back the monsters. You can only flee and/or hide. When you hear that grunt and the terrifying music start, you KNOW that your life is in danger. This game gave me possibly the most powerful experience a game has ever: I entered  the Morgue, after solving the hardest puzzle ever. The atmosphere was crushing, but I knew what I had to do: extract blood from a corpse. So I did. After injecting myself with the blood, I wanted to leave, but I heard the brutish growl of the Monster. My heart started pounding harder than it has ever done as I quickly opened the door behind me and hid with the corpses. I heard the door break down in a single blow. I heard the metallic sound of it´s movement. My heart did not stop pounding untill the music stopped and I believed I was safe.The Insanity system makes the game all around more terrifying: enemies can´t find you as EASILY in the dark, but if you stay in the darkness too long, you will start to lose sanity and the enemies will easily find you. Lightsources, especially the lantern, help you retain sanity, but you don´t need to be smart to realise that THEY can see light.So, this game will make you crawl through numerous horrifying sights, sounds and feels. It is a constant terror that you might hear the monstrous growl of a Gatherer and be forced to make decisions in a split second. It is a game that will keep you at the edge of your seat through the whole play. And if you do manage to finish the main story, you can download custom stories made by the community to face even more terror.10/10, most terrifying game ever made, and it´s legacy is continuing even till today.

Sound for reading![soundcloud.com]OK, I'm proper scared. I've just been stalked through a sewer by something I can't see, let alone fight.The only thing that gave it away was the languid ker-splosh of its footsteps as it ranged around after me. Every time I lost my footing on the narrow path of tottering crates and other detritus and landed in the drink, a flurry of intense sploshing rose sharply in volume as it made for my meat. It was utterly, panicinducingly horrible. I made errors in judgement, I missed jumps, I clenched. When it was all over, I nearly had a little cry.Amnesia does Lovecraft in the purest sense: it understands that the imagined far outweighs the known in its psychological punch, and it gives you enough audio and visual cues to imagine a very carnival of horrors. From the twisted brainpipes of Frictional games, the guys behind the Penumbra series, this is every part the worthy successor, with considerably higher production values, bags more atmosphere, and a deeper exploration of the parallel themes of horror and insanity. While these screenshots shout FPS, it shares more with point-and-click adventures than shooters. There's not a weapon in sight: it's all about the puzzles, exploiting the neat physics engine, combining items to apply to the environment, and hiding when the nasties come.The story unfolds from a locus of zero knowledge, aside from one fact: your name is Daniel. You wake in a medieval castle, and finding a note you'd previously written for yourself, you discover you're here for a reason. In fact, you've been here for some time, and as the plot expands through further diary-notes and flashbacks, the unsavoury purpose behind your presence becomes apparent. You're also just a bit afraid of the dark. The whole place is graveyard-dim, but you collect tinder-boxes to light torches and candles, and oil for your lamp. Keeping the shadows at bay is a constant – and necessary – struggle. (Photo-1[images.alphacoders.com])Spend too long in the gloaming, and madness beckons. As Daniel's sanity starts to stutter, imagination plays merry hell. Insects skitter across your vision, the input-lag between mouse-gesture and action goes to hell, the ground lurches sickeningly, and you'll hear things – whispers, cries and horrid noises, one of which can only be described as someone pulling crabs apart.Against this background, you learn of the unspeakable experiments that happened here, and your involvement with them, as something hideous dogs your steps. It's hard to talk about certain specifics without spoilers, but suffice it to say, there are scenes you'll recoil at. One area of the game is devoted to revealing the psychological and physical specifics of medieval torture methods; fascinating in a horribly suggestive way, and all, somehow, tied to your past. When it's not breathing down your neck, lurching after you or trying to eat your face, Amnesia shows you bad things and makes you feel dirty!And that's its triumph: one of grisly atmosphere over genre convention, with tension and release in keen balance. It seems rude to pick holes – some of the vocal delivery, for example, lacks the credible touch, and occasionally, you'll have no idea what the puzzle you're working on is meant to achieve; you just have to keep trying things out. But it's well worth it, and a snip at £12.95. Despite its title, Amnesia remembers what the blockbusters of survival horror seem to have forgotten: how to horrify. (Photo-2[images5.fanpop.com])Hug!

 Amnesia: The Dark Descent  is a hardcore survival horror game from 2010 developed by Frictional Games,the same guys who did the Penumbra series,so they have a reputation among indie/horror developers,along with years of experience on how to create seriously depressing and horrifying worlds. This review will be on the short side,because just about 15 thousand other people have said everything about this game,I am just here to put my two cents in,in fact,I feel obligated to write at least a few paragraphs,since this game deserves attention and respect,it is a staple and a benchmark by which all other horror games are judged. Basically it reformed and created a new sub-genre among horror games (and also because it took me 4 years to play it through,you can laugh now,yeah).Now,I'm not gonna spoil the story for you,but rest assured,it is engaging,mysterious,and interesting enough to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout your descend into darkness. The Lovecraftian elements are obvious here, mixed with some heavy influence from Poe (namely the setting itself,among others). You are Daniel,an archeologist hailing from Britain,London. You wake up in the middle of the night in the castle of Brennenburg,located in East-Prussia. Hindered by amnesia (and probably some anxiety/paranoia),chased by an obscure shadow,your quest is to uncover a big mystery, what the hell happened to you,why are you in that old,decrepit place,and ultimately,to survive this living nightmare.In the following section,we are going to take a look at the gameplay, the quality of the visuals/audio design,and the atmosphere.The gameplay itself is simplistic yet your heart will probably skip a few beats. Seriously,this game is not for the faint of heart: you do not have means to defend yourself in any way,your only options are to either run,hide,or die. Your only friends are your trusty lantern and tinderboxes. You can utilize these in a way so that you won't go insane from total darkness surrounding the halls and passageways (at one point,torture chambers:p) of the castle. But beware,because if you stand in light,the monstrous creatures roaming the château will spot you with ease. There are the occasional puzzle segments,which are not too shabby,it gives you a little pause between discovering the place and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants.With that out of the way,let's talk about the technical side of things: usually,when it comes to the graphics,I can be a little nitpicky,I'm not the ""anything goes"" type of guy,the visuals of a game can either immerse or put me off. Sometimes graphics don't matter,but we are talking about Amnesia,a game,in which the story is partially told and progressed with the medium of visuals. The guys do not disappoint,they did a stellar job in this department. I am not saying that the textures are Crysis/Shadow of Mordor/xy quality,but the way the game handles the lighting is nothing short of amazing.The atmosphere is heavy,crushing,morbid,other-worldly. It is mandatory to play this piece of art with the lights off,headphones on. Yes,headphones. If you are playing any other way,you deserve to get dragged out to the street and beaten with a stupid stick. The sound,music and the ambience is amazing. Men,women,children screaming in agony,the growl of monsters,walls cracking,wood creaking,chains rattling,inexplicable noises coming from the end of the pitch black hallway. It is all here. Enough said.Ultimately,Amnesia is not just a game. It is a dark,terrifying tale to be experienced. If you think,you have the guts,the perseverance,and the love for the genre itself,go right ahead,enter Brennenburg. Just do not forget your name and your lantern.			",62,8,0,9,1,0,10

												This is the best horror game I've ever played. It is all about the atmosphere, ambience and the story. The way that Frictional Games keep pumping the tension during the game is just brilliant. The game is really immersive and if you get into it, you get into the story, get into the feeling of the main character, you'll be fully immersed and will feel all the horrors and fears that awaits behind every corner. That's what happened to me. Being adult, I have never been so frightened by any of the media content: either it is a movie or a game. But the Amnesia: The Dark Descent literally made me be afraid and really swet because of the tension.And there are no cheap techniques like so-called ""jump scares"" or anything I can remember of. All the scary feelings are invoked by the game's atmosphere built by amaizing art and graphics, brilliant ambient and sound effects, intriguing story and gameplay elements. It is your mind which, upon this all, will build inside the conclusions of the upcoming danger, which will may or may not happen. But you'll never know what is it this time: true danger or you're deluding yourself.Worth to mention that gameplay is built upon the idea, that you can't fight and directly resist your enemies with weapon. Therea are no weapond, no direct fights, no health bar, no danget indicators. And me personally like this idea and gameplay philosophy of Frictional Games, which they evolved from the great Penumbra series (in the first game you actually could fight, but avoiding it was the best option all the time). And alongside the dark atmosphere and unknown danger, when you don't know what is happening, who you may face with, and what it will cost you, the best idea that you would come up with in such situation in real life - is try to hide, or somehow avoid the danger, or run as fast as you can. You wouldn't stop to check out whether that butcher is gonna slaughter you or give you a hug.If you liked what I have described, you should definitely grab and play this game (it's free right now)! There is much more! And I'm sure that upcoming SOMA will be another horror masterpiece. Thank you Frictional Games!			",78,22,13,11,3,1,1

												I played like an hour, the whole hour I moved maybe down a hall at most... Saw a monster, it chased me, I crapped my pants and ran from the PC fo' real. My nerves cannot take this game, It's way to freaky and I think it's mainly because you just can't fight back. If you want a scary game that will get your heart racing and possibly you racing out of your house screaming, then get Amnesia!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most intense emotional experiences of my life. You will want to scream, vomit, laugh, cry, suicide and explode at the same time while being trapped in its extremely disturbing and horrifying reality. It will induce in you terrible nightmares and feelings of abandonment and claustrophobia. Full-body chills guaranted. At night xD.			",191,33,9,25,4,1,16

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of the greatest horror experiences a gamer can have. It is horrifying. It is unsettling. If you take the time to explore Castle Brennenburg, it has an engrossing plot.  Every part of this game is crafted to give the player a sense of place, dread, and in many cases, disgust. You will be scared like you never have before. Easily stands with the greatest horror games of all time!			",111,22,1,11,4,0,2

												This was the first Horror game I've played and I fell in love with it.  The music, the sounds, the atmosphere all make this game a gem.  I felt there was a good balance of scariness and they didnt try too throw it in your face.  The lore was good as well as the puzzles.  Best part about this game are all the story mods you can get.  Just a ton of other great stories and scares to get for free.			",90,18,1,24,38,0,71

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Made right to be done right.""Best Survival Horror Indie Game""Amnesia - The Dark Descent is the kind of survival horror game that must be done right. By that, I mean not playing it surrounded with natural and/or artificial light and plenty of people around who may or may not have played this before. This is the kind of title that asks for you to be alone in the dark with stereo headphones on. This is how you properly set the gamma the first time you play the game. You have to properly set the mood in order for you to get the best possible horror experience out of Amnesia - The Dark Descent.Overall: Amnesia the Dark Descent is an enjoyable title with a refreshing twist on the survival horror genre. But as stated the re-playability is limited but is at least worth the 20 bucks just so as long you enjoy this type of experience. Other than that: Good job Frictional Game!

												Very spooky. Not jump-scare filled, and effectively emmersive, so when fear comes, it is real! Very story driven as well - I found myself wanting to find more letters to read to discover what on earth is going on rather than rolling my eyes at a bunch of words I have to read.

Minor Note: This account has ~40 hours played because I didn't have family sharing before this review. INTRO / SUMMARYThe focus of this review is to explain the horror aspect of the game since an incomplete playthrough leaves me unable to adequately analyze anything else.The goal of this survival horror is to scare the player. Amnesia: The Dark Descent was not scary enough to keep my interest to finish the game. I kept playing to try and finish it all in one sitting, however, I stopped after 9 hours because I realized Amnesia was just not my kind of horror.  On a good note, it did stray away from the action and guns-blazing direction that some horror series seem to be going down. Of course, not everyone has the same idea of horror so I’ll further elaborate in the next sections to help anyone who may be indecisive…Pros:+ Some interesting grotesque designs and haunting atmosphere+ Impressive graphics, lighting and physics+ Great immersive soundtrackCons:- Not many scary moments- Tedious, repetitive and predictable- Lacks the “struggle aspect” in survival horror (in terms of game-play, for the PLAYER)- Daniel’s reactions took away from the experience (and made me feel like the bigger man)“WILL IT BE SCARY FOR ME?”[Not Recommended] If you…  Believe that being startled or nervous is not the equivalent to being scared. Prefer horror titles to include a game-play challenge to stay alive (e.g. careful management, risk vs reward, fight vs flight decisions, etc). Usually figure out the “formula” or “pattern” in video games. (This may remove the immersion and dampen the horror for you.) Think that keeping the protagonist calm and from fainting sounds like babysitting rather than a sanity mechanic. [Recommended]If you…  Prefer a ""casual"" or “theme park” sense of horror where the emphasis is on exploration, imagery and atmosphere. Believe the aesthetic presentation is more important than game-play to make an effective horror title (e.g. imagery, sounds, visual design, etc.). Agree that challenging game-play makes a horror title frustrating rather than scary or it is not preferred.   Don’t get tired from playing a cat and mouse game for 9+ hours. Like H.P. Lovecraft inspired themes and/or psychological horror.THE SCARY FACTOR - FURTHER ANALYSISThe game attempts to provide a horror experience through atmosphere based on the fear of what cannot be seen (in the wait of physical danger), psychological horror (hence ""amnesia"" and the horrors uncovered from the protagonist's psyche), imagery to disturb the player, very few jump-scares, and providing the feeling of defenselessness by having no weapon option. My experience, however, lacked horror most of the time because the game’s predictability allowed me to be confident in my ability to run and hide rather than testing my courage or facing my fears head-on. For the most part you walk around, collect stuff, solve a puzzle, run from easy enemy AI, hide, and repeat. I was able to figure out the pattern of the game early; I knew that for the most part I was safe, had a good idea on what would trigger the encounters and what to do when that happened. I was prepared and ready. -Because of this, most of the game felt like filler for the sake of having a pattern or to make the game longer. I would have preferred a short game compressed of clever horror events (such as evolving the mechanics) rather than a drawn out experience of the same thing repeated.Another problem was that this game didn't have the sense of struggle that survival horror usually provides to accomplish horror. Amnesia’s experience felt effortless to succeed compared to other survival horror titles I've played (e.g. Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Rule of Rose, etc.); as a result, I never felt in any real danger. There weren't any good portrayals of careful management of resources, a high risk vs. reward or anything like that. Limited lamp oil was a good start, but the 60 tinderboxes (cylinders?) in my inventory were too large of a safety net. The sanity meter was another attempt to make you manage your light sources, but Daniel’s reaction to everything that happens takes away from the experience. He’ll gasp, breathe heavily and faint to indicate his lowering sanity from occurrences; as a result, I got annoyed and couldn't help but to roll my eyes at the fact the game had to point out what’s “scary” through Daniel.Although there were some moments I did like (no spoilers, just vague descriptions). The water level and prison hallways provided a different change of pace. The water part was a good example on how the game-play could be dynamic, yet still use the same simple mechanics in order to provide uncertainty and invade the player’s comfort without the use of combat or completely seeing the enemy. The prison hallways provided a claustrophobic feeling in the narrow hallways with a great contrast between the vulnerability of the unknown within the darkness and the exposure to be seen in the light. There were no “obvious” hiding places, such as a closet, instead you had to rely on anything you could in your environment, (e.g. dark corner, hiding behind furniture etc.) which made the fear and game-play feel more “natural” in these sections.

												What makes ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" so scary and spooky is the environment combined with sinister background music that changes depending on your mental state. Playing around with the physics of almost any object ingame is one of the main features in this game and I enjoy it quite a lot. You can't fight back in this game but you can hide and block doors with any moveable objects. There is also a bonus chapter which is pretty well done imo.If you ever manage to complete the game you can try out some custom stories from the community. There are quite a lot of them and some of them are scary as hell... Your journey to the dark site has just begun my friend!			",77,19,0,4,4,0,0

												A genuinely great and unique game. It’s a bit of a milestone in gaming history because most horror games after it had some sort of feature or aspect that was from amnesia which is awesome. This was my second playthrough since I first played it back at release and I didn’t find it very scary this time, probably because I remembered all the scary moments because the game is so memorable. The fact that I remembered so much about the game since I first played it almost 6 years ago is crazy, it just shows the quality of the scares and the level design in particular. Very good atmosphere and sound design, it’s a very loud game with headphones compared to other games with the same volume level. Pretty interesting story for what is, very simple and creepy and it works nicely. I particularly like the ending. The puzzles are very challenging and clever but sometimes the solutions are very vague, I had to look up a few times what to do with mixed reactions after. Sometimes I felt like an idiot for not being able to figure it out but there were a few objects to pick up or interact with where I thought ‘I would never have found that myself’. This is a bit of a gripe, most times you encounter an enemy its mainly for a distance and all you have to do is just hide for a second and they go away which is part of why I didn’t find the game scary anymore. If the monster actually went and chased you in those situations It would have worked better. But even then when I was getting chased by an enemy I usually let them kill me straight away just so they could go away and they don’t spawn again in the same area where you died the next time which I consider a bit of a design flaw especially after just recently playing alien isolation with the manually saving. I also just recently played a lot of horror games that I found scarier than amnesia and I’m sure it’s mostly because it was my second playthrough. I think this is a must play if you haven’t played it yet.  8/10 (Great)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												I must say, this game is REALLY scary. And I mean it. I remember when this game came and peolple were like: ""This is too scary, I can't play it more than couple of minutes"" or ""I'm gonna never play this game again"". I've been playing the orginal story trough and before it I had watched many gameplays and walktrhougs from it. Even after them I was really afraid when I played it. I knowed well enough where monsters appears, but nevertheless they scared me.The basic idea of the game is survive in dark castle and escape from monsters. You can't fight to monsters, you can only escape or hide. You must also collect the pages of your diary, because you haven't memories from past. Them tell you about the story. The game isn't just running and hiding. There's also many puzzles what give such good a change.It's not just scare because of terrible and ugly monsters (sometimes it's even quite funny to play with them), the real horror is made by absolutely great atmosphere. And what make this atmosphere, they are sounds and musics. Firstly I must praise musics. From peaceful and mystical ambiences to terrible and oppressive themes. In different places you hear variable musics and also every events and monsters have it's own themes.The storytelling is made by foundable diary pages and sounds what you here in flashbacks. I'm such glad that there isn't very much violence in the game, but the sounds you sometimes hear in the flashbacks will be disturbing. A whole sound of world is very well carry out. Also the great story and scare places create good atmosphere.Bad in this game is sometimes quite bad bugs and shortness, but you can download other palyers enlargements from net.Buy this game, it's great!

												This game is not one of those all ""hype"" and no ""show"", it will drain your guts dry as it is one of the scariest horror game there is. You play as Daniel, a Londoner who just experienced a terrible ""amnesia"" and woke up on the floor of a big mansion, armed with nothing at all but cinder boxes and a lantern to lit the darkness where the fiend of the mansion may hide and stalk your back. Reminded me of how a survival horror game should be, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is really the ultimate interactive horror software that horror mongers should enjoy, with a good and deep story telling keeping you tense on the edge of the seat on most of the playtime. The sanity feature really gives an identity to the game, as no game before this has it. Will you prowl in the dark hiding from the ""residents"" of the mansion stealthily and go nuts, or lit everything that can be with the risk of being seen but stay sane? Definitely a must buy for the true fans of the amazing genre survival horror that is.			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												An old classic horror game that changed the history of the horror genre and youtube. Amnesia the Dark Descent. is a first-person horror game, where you play as Daniel, who seems to have drank an potion that gave him anmesia. it's your job to venture into the darkness and solve the reason behind of own actions and find the man who seems to be the reason behind all this.In Amnesia the Dark Descent you must advance in the game, solve puzzles and avoid being seen by the monsters. You have no weapons or any ways of defending yourself, so you must hide, or run if necessary. Unlike other horror games, Amnesia has a sanity meter, which slowly drains if you are in darkness, if you look at the monsters or see unexpected events. if it get's too low. your screen will start to shake, nearby evironment may change and the monsters might find you easier. Amnesia the Dark Descent should not be played to win. but to be played for the exprience. it's called the ""king of horror"" by gamers for a reason. and i'll hugely recommend this game to every horror game lover and to those who wants to try a spooky game.

												We're currently going through an age where the horror genre is dying out as they're getting repetitive, at least for horror games that occupy the Steam market and Steam Greenlight. However, when people thought that there was no hope, Amnesia: The Dark Descent decided to come on in and show everybody how a horror game should be done.In Amnesia: The Dark Descent, the main thing that makes it a truly great horror experience is the fact that it makes you defenseless as you have nothing to defend yourself against the horrors that may lie inside the castle. All you have is your trusty oil lantern, which keeps on running out of oil and forces you to find more. Your only way of truly escaping these monsters is to hide from them by using the darkness and the hiding places to your advantage. However, if you spend too long in the darkenss, it can affect your sanity, so you can't spend too long in the darkness. This is a great way to experience true horror, making you feel defenceless against the monsters that litter the castle, that are rigorously trying to hunt you down. It's rare you feel this sort of way in horror games nowadays, which is why it's so refreshing to see it being taken into effect in this game. There are also some puzzles that are thrown at the player, none of these puzzles are difficult per say as long as you've been paying attention to the notes and hints that have been left around for you, however some of these puzzles feel a bit tedious and unnecessary to add in.The story of Amnesia is that you play as Daniel who has woken in the castle with no recolection of anything at all, you as the player must tread through the castle, picking up notes, piecing back together Daniel's memory, avoiding the enemies around the castle and foiling a maniacal scheme that is set to be carried out. I always like the sort of games that throw this sort of plot at the player because it makes you feel immersedin the role as the main character knows as much as the player does and he learns along with the player. However besides the set up of it, the rest of the plot doesn't feel that special and, I'm not going to revela spoilers here or anything, but by the time I reached the end of the game, I fealt like I had more questions than answers and for the last 20 minutes, due to the story, I fealt like I wasn't really playing the game I thought I was going to be playing when I first started it up, if you know what I mean.This is an indie development company and I was amazed by the graphics when the game started. They went into lots of detail when designing the game. The lighting work that is done on the windows of the castle is great, the walls look really god and detailed, even the monster look quite good. The only complaint I have is that some of the creatures that scatter across the ground at times look like they were made of an ugly blob, but that's just nitpicking.The sound in this game is brilliant. The noises that occupy the castle sound terrifyingly real, especially with headphones, it really helps you immerse yourself in the world that this game is creating.I really enjoyed my time with Amnesia: The Dark Descent as it took risks that other horror games dare not take and did it with a terrific pay offPros+ Terrifying+ Good gameplay elements+ Good graphics+ Great sounds+ Pretty good storyCons- Tedious puzzles- Got a bit sci-fi near the endFinal verdict: 9/10My Steam curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews ",312,88,2,34,26,3,20

												I had already played this game before receiving it from steam.I think it deserves a review for the following reasons:- I thought that nothing could scare me, i was wrong!- I thought that horror games were just a compilation of jump scares, i was wrong!- I thought that i could finish the game without worrying of my heart pumping out of my chest, i was wrong! The game has a great atmosphere. You always feel anxious, stressed and paranoid.If you like Lovecraft's work, this game is for you. The game is heavily influenced by his writings.What else can i say, hold onto your seats, watch your back and enjoy the game!			",100,12,4,11,9,0,8

												Now this game isn't the scariest game I've seen, I'll be honest. But that doesn't mean crap. Just because a horror game ISN'T scary doesn't mean its not good. The puzzles were great. It had an amazing mystery element to it, and its downright not too cliche'd or overdone with its scares. It has the right balance between lore and scaring. and sometimes its a mix of both. The lore can be scary at times. Like FNAF, its not the atmosphere, its not the monsters, its not even the voice acting. No, its the lore. The lore is what makes it so great. If you want a story driven horror game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a great game for you. 9.3/10			",104,8,0,10,8,3,10

												I played Amnesia for 11 hours and i enjoyed every single moment of this game. It's full of dark places, your light is limited, and there are monsters around you, which you can only free from. The lack of light makes you feel scared and insecure, expecially for your ""brain health"": if there's no sufficient light or if you are looking to a monster for too much time, the brain health will go down and strange visions and effects will appear on the screen. I think it's one of the best aspects of this game. The sound has a great quality as well, making you feel inside the game, and there are many puzzles and hard parts that will keep your brain working for long time. I advice for sure this game to the horror fans, and i advice to the others to try it out, cause it really deserves a lot.			",92,12,0,6,3,0,5

 Amnesia: The Dark Descent  Production of the creators of Penumbra. This is the adventure survival horror, tells the story of Daniel, who has lost his memory on its own initiative and now wanders basements, hallways and and other parts of the huge castle discovering the horrific events of his past and struggle to survive. The game is about exploration but also in our way will be a puzzles to solve. He is not able to defend themselves against the monsters so our goal is to avoid contact with them, hiding, avoiding the dark but also taking care of the health and psychological status of our hero. The game is one of the best survival horrors I've ever played, dark and gloomy atmosphere, great sound system, the monsters that always will give you creeps, taking care not to run out of oil lamp. In addition there is the ability to play the new campaigns created by players. If you're a fan of such a games I would definitely recommend this production. ",442,96,20,45,31,7,33

												Story: The story follows Daniel, a fellow from London who awakes in Brennenburg Castle with amnesia. The game tells the story primarily through audio flashbacks Daniel has while exploring the castle. These flashbacks along with notes you can find inform you of your past. Through these notes your past self directs you to the inner sanctum where you must kill a man named Alexander. Past Daniel also mentions a shadow that follows you relentlessly and cannot be stopped. Amnesia’s primary story and message is found in these flashbacks and journals, here you’ll learn why Daniel has no memories, why you wanted to kill Alexander, and what the shadow is. A major theme of Amnesia is morality and it is primarily studied through Daniel’s actions before he lost his memory. Without spoiling the major plot points, the game does a great job of putting the player into a state of mind and position where they can weigh the moral decisions made by their player character Daniel and not feel a great dissonance. That is important as the moral dilemmas Daniel faced are another whole terrifying aspect of Amnesia. This being said, the story and past events add to the suffocating and tension-filled atmosphere. The story and atmosphere prop each other, each benefitting from the others consistent delivery. The story of Amnesia is not brilliant or revolutionary but it does plague the character with the dark realities of his past, in turn adding to what is truly exceptional about Amnesia, its atmosphere.Atmosphere: The setting of Amnesia is Brennenburg Castle, a dark, crumbling castle somewhere in Prussia. This setting is a truly perfect fit for the gameplay and story. The castles interior is eerie, wet, falling into ruin, and mysterious. The interior design of the castle is pretty standard stuff for the most part, with your archives, cellars and such. Although standard, the aesthetics and sounds combined with just enough mystery and dark influences make the game very original in execution, especially for a video game. Nearly the entire game takes place inside the castle, as you dive into its bowels. Only for a moment do you step outside. This moment was pretty cool too. For me it provided some real context and sense of where I was in the world, even if I only saw a vast dark forest. Something about seeing what surrounded the castle added another layer to the isolation and overbearing darkness of the atmosphere. All this darkness and weightiness of the atmosphere becomes suffocating and nearly a deterrent to continuing the game. Luckily, there are skillfully placed hub areas that provide a much needed contrast to the claustrophobic, monster inhabited areas. These hub areas take a weight off your chest by providing just enough light and calming sounds. That leads me to the sound design, which truly amplifies the feelings of suffocation, claustrophobia, and ultimately terror. The sound effects pick and gnaw at you, with sounds of rats, insects, and the unknown. Meanwhile the soundtrack provides a deep, trembling groan that is ever-present. Sounds like grinding or cavernous echoes ebb in and out seamlessly. That is the greatness of this sound design, it is seamlessly bound to the atmosphere and gameplay. This effectively immerses the player entirely in the game world. Aside from the main menu, there is no remarkable track that you’ll recall afterwards. You’ll only be left with the feelings that sounds and visuals provided you.Gameplay: The gameplay of Amnesia is fairly simple but deep in its applications. The way you’re able to interact with objects physically is satisfying and intuitive. This is primarily implemented in three scenarios: searching for items, solving puzzles, and hiding from/blocking monsters. While moving through the game, the physics engine really connects you to the game. I see this as a huge benefit in a game where you’re banking on becoming immersed. Using environmental objects to solve puzzles makes the puzzles see less contrived and more natural for the situation. Using wardrobes and stacking barrels to hide for monsters really throws you into the world, giving you a fantastic physical sense of the game. This mechanic adds serious depth to gameplay that isn’t up in your face. The moments when you come across a monster for the first few times, the game leaves you feeling helpless and overwhelmed in terror. It takes you a second to think of what you can do. Then you realize you must push on, so hiding and running often are a temporary solution. In all, the monsters and their encounters are well designed and used sparingly as to not reveal too much.Your inventory stores a few essential items along with puzzle items. You’re also able to craft here, although crafting is not a big component of the game. This interface also houses your sanity status. Sanity in Amnesia is a crucial mechanic that pits the player against a rock and a hard place. The idea is that you lose sanity in the dark but while you in the light you’re easily seen by monsters. It’s a mechanic the whole game rests on to keep the player on their toes. An aspect that ties into sanity is solving puzzles. Puzzles will boost your sanity when solved and holy crap is this an effective way to encourage the push on! The satisfaction from completing puzzles is really felt by the player, as a wave of relief rushes over you. Overall, I must say I love the gameplay here. It takes a step back to let the atmosphere do its work, while bolstering the players’ connection to the game world.Overall: Since the release of Amnesia, its formula has been reused several times with some games reaching larger audiences. I’d recommend this game to anyone who wants a first-person horror experience. If you’re someone who has played any of Amnesia’s contemporaries and influenced works and enjoyed it, this game is well worth your time. From the outside looking in the game may look outdated or silly/cliché. Amnesia will prove these notions wrong as I have not come across a game more terrifying and immersive. This game is an example that graphical fidelity is not all important if you have excellent game and world design.			",88,6,0,3,4,0,10

												Into the lightI’m not normally a fan of games that present you with deadly enemies and then give you no option to defend yourself, but ATDD uses this device cautiously and to good effect. Evading the enemies is fairly stressful (as it should be) but is never frustrating or annoying. ATDD is all about atmosphere, which it has by the bucketload, and story, which it has in some depth. Much of what has to be done in the game, by way of solving puzzles, will be familiar to anyone who has played adventure games before but here again ATDD gets the formula just right. This is the first survival horror game I’ve played that has no combat (I’ve played plenty that do) and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it performs in both the survival and the horror aspects. Graphically it’s pretty good but not outstanding. There are some nice touches of interactivity: you have to pull and push at doors and drawers in order to open and close them. And the sound design is also very atmospheric. It’s a fairly short game but it packs quite a lot into 10–15 hours of gameplay and is recommended if you like the horror genre. 4/5			",77,5,0,6,1,0,3

												I always thought this game was overhyped and well, dumb. Man was I wrong (and stupid). While I have not finished the game, the short amount of time I have played, has been good. Real good. The game is pretty scary with a great atmosphere and I feel like most of the terror and tension comes from the superb sound design. I have been frightened multiple times, just from gusts of wind or creaking doors/floors. I keep meaning to play more of it, but I think (subconsciously) I'm too scared. So in the likely case I never finish the game, from what I have seen...a solid 9.5/10 OH plus there are a ton of custom stories you can download and play. ""A Cowards Debt"" is great.

												A nice change of pace to the horror genre. I literally had to take breaks to walk away from my computer for being scared, then come back after convincing myself of how my little nephew would've been able to play it and how embarassing my sister nagging me about it would be. I'd rather not explain any of the game as it's relatively self explanatory and I don't want to give anything away even in the littlest detail.Pros:+ Atmosphere - Really pulls you into the game,+ Jump scares as well as other scares actually scare you+ Inability to defend yourself makes for a much more scary mechanic+ Story9/10, I would definitely give it a try if you've never played it before.

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is the kind of game that can keep tension all the time. You go ahead from riddle to riddle with the constant sensation of being observed and the very moment you let your guard down... You jump on your chair! Recommended to those who grew up with graphic adventures but want some horror and some good adrenaline that makes you feel simple moments like they're lasting forever. You keep saying yourself ""be quiet, somebody could hear you"". Always keep your eyes and ears open, DON'T try to face whoever you find (or finds you)... Turn back, run and hide. If you can't stay in the dark, but not for too long as the dark can make you go crazy and make you see things that don't exist... do they?!Highly Recommended			",362,65,8,21,21,4,28

												Don't look anything up about this game, just play it. Most of the negative reviews are about the game being boring but that only applies to the first hour where it introduces you to the story and starts building up some tension and atmosphere. Don't use tutorials, guides or walkthroughs because those tend to spoil tricks the developer(s) set up very carefully.			",51,11,0,0,10,0,3

												9 Spooky Scary Skeletons out of 10+ great atmosphere+ really immersive+ not being able to fight back makes you feel helpless+ the story was kind of meh in my opinion, although the fact that your character learns the story and his memories with you is neat+ you can find some really awesome custom stories for it! (and some that are so bad that they are               good again)- the only thing I disliked is the fact that enemies tend to disappear after you get killed, removing any challenge from that particular encounterIf you are unsure whether to buy it or not, I'd recommend to watch the beginning of a Let's Play or walkthrough to get a better understanding of the game.

PROS+ Speaking personally, this game terrified me. I mean, I actually got so... involved in the atmosphere of the game that I still remember clearly the majority of the game since the last time I played it, years ago.+ I'm not the biggest fan of horror games, and I gotta admit that sometimes I just wanted to just quit the game because I was kinda tired of ""sh*tting in my pants"", but hey, that's one of the purpose of games like these!+ Very good story.+ The whole idea of the game to get away from the darkness is nice and challeging.+ The place and time of the facts in the game couldn't be better and scarier.+ Purely terrific and scary atmosphere.+ The sounds are very well made.CONS- I didn't honestly noticed any major cons in this game for its genre.OVERALL 8.4/10 - Play it, in a dark room, with phones... and diapers. Don't forget the diapers. ",403,94,16,43,28,4,38

												The creepy Lovecraftian atmosphere of the darkened halls of Brennenburg Castle and the disturbing entities within will scare you down to your core. You have no weapons to defend yourself from the lurking creatures. You can only put temporary obstacles in front of them or run away and hide in the dark, but not for too long before you start to lose your sanity, which makes you even more vulnerable to attacks, although you can always light your path with your lamp and torches.Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an unsettling and uncanny experience: storyline told in the form of memories and diary pages, spooky visuals, a fair amount of physics-based puzzles, tense moments and spine-chilling sound effects that will put your nerves to the test.

												This is one hell of a creepy game! And this is no lie!At the beginning it is slow and somekind of a bit moody. But if you let yourself drawn in by its atmosphere it will haunt you. At least at that fricking waterfilled basement!In the end I ripped my headphones off my ears and paused that damn game. First time such thing ever happened to me. The gameplay mechanics are well-thought; you can't defeat monsters with a arsenal of weapons and amusengly high amounts of ammunition. You can only hide from them and hope they won't see you. Very nice: Enemies will detect you if you stare at them. This leads to situation where you facing a wall and hoping this creature will leave the room already without detecting you. Very nice, to be remembered what it is to be a child. Where is the ""double thumps up"" -Button? Such games deserve one!			",173,32,2,12,6,0,5

												This is my review on this beloved horror game, Amnesia The Dark Descent. This game is incredible and has amazing atmosphere and creepy jump scares, well, for the custom stories that is. The story goes like this. Your name is Daniel and you enter a creepy castle and have to try and kill someone named Alexander of Brennenberg and this game is all about the stealth! Yes, STEALTH! You can't kill any enemies you just have to simply hide and wait, or just run away from them or, you can troll them and try to kill them which I don't know what's the fun in that but that's my opinion. Anyways this game is just so much fun and Frictional Games also made a DLC called Justine which is pretty difficult, if you die you have to start all over again and you also get to choose if you wanna save the prisoner's or kill them, which I always like to be evil. Also I highly suggest you play the game with your headphones and full blast and in a dark room cause that just makes it even more possible for you to get very scared. Frictional Games made another series before this called Penumbra which is very good I've seen Markiplier play it and I wanna play it myself but it won't let me (which makes me VERY sad), and there's 3 games, there's Overture, Black Plague and Requim which is just kinda like a DLC which a LOT ofth very hard puzzles (from what I've heard). Frictional has also FINALLY made the sequel to Amnesia called A Machine For Pigs which, I will make a review on that, not going to say anything on that subject *shudders* but yea that's pretty much all I can think of. This is my first review and I'm terrible at doing them I hope you can bare with me on that. So if you haven't played the game I hope this will tempt you to go and buy it and get scared as hell cause, a lot of the custom stories are VERY scary (coming from a guy who doesn't get scared at all)! Well there ya have it, that's all I've got on my noggin so I'll see ya guys next time for my next review and, have a great day all and one last thing to say, you'd better have a lot of pants! PEACE OUT!			",99,13,0,12,4,0,2

												Someone bought this game for me specifically because they knew it would scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me, and they were right. I've tried so many times to play this game in ways where I wasn't terrified of everything, but it just doesn't work that way. Play this game with a good set of speakers and/or high quality headphones, and you're in for some good ol' fashioned misery. I'd say it's worth the money, but I didn't even buy it, and I haven't made it very far in terms of progression. I'm sure it's worth the money though.			",52,17,1,14,9,0,3

												This is an excellent game. I watched a lot of playthroughs before starting it myself because I was too scared to play it without knowing ahead of time. That said...I haven't played it in months because I know there's a massive jumpscare in the next scene.Anyway, this is the first horror game I ever played (other than Slender which really is just a heart attack simulator for me, rather than a creep-out game). I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did - well, enjoy the parts I managed to play before pussing out. :)			",23,5,0,4,4,0,1

												WARNING: This recommendation contains mild spoilers. I'll keep them to a minimum though.I first heard about Amnesia: The Dark Descent when some of my friends were talking about it. They didn't tell much but it seemed interesting enough to have a look at it. I always had some really creepy games in my ""Best games I've ever played""-list, but I had not played anything like Amnesia before.So what is it about? Your name is Daniel and you're from London, Mayfair. That's all you know when you wake up from being unconscious. You are in a medieval-looking castle and have no idea how you got there. Nobody is around so you wander around the castle looking for answers. Eventually you find a note that is addressed to you and was written by - yourself. The information in this note is the only clue you have while wandering the castle of Brennenburg, in a desperate search for answers while trying to get away from whatever is trying to hunt you down.Unlike many other titles that are labeled horror, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is not a hybrid type game like a horror shooter or a horror-RPG. You cannot simply blast your way through the castle using fancy weapons or magic. Daniel hasn't got any kind of weapon and - surprise - he will never find one. Still there are enemies within the castle, and they are not the ones to be reasoned with. Your only means of self-defense are running and hiding. In most situations the latter one is preferable. Dark places are great if you don't want to be seen but hiding in the dark also exposes Daniel to the horrors within his own mind. You find yourself constantly wondering if you should light the candles in a room to avoid going crazy while being at risk of being found.Amnesia: The Dark Descent is all about immersion. There is no HUD and your two most important resources - health and sanity - aren't represented by definite numbers. You have to keep both in mind, though. The game physics highly contributes to the immersive experience. If you want to open a drawer you don't simply click it. Instead you grab it using your mouse and draw it towards you. That also makes it possible to either open doors slowly and with great care or to slam them shut.Amnesia not your generic horror-ish game, it's the real deal. It is not about fighting your way through hordes of enemies or being the hero who saves the world. The whole game is about nothing but atmosphere. If you can appreciate that Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a definitive must-buy.More reviews here ",268,35,3,26,16,4,28

												Amnesia is a well known game, and there's not much to tell so I am directing this to SOMA fans who are curious about trying it out. Do it. It's not a technical masterpiece, but you won't care soon, since the atmosphere is so suffocating and drenched in dread and decay. And some things you do in there just to survive are just... deplorable, mental. Frictional Games knows horror, knows that the monster is not the one chasing you, but the environment and atmosphere itself, the story, idea, and possibly you. It stayed with me for a few days now.So, SOMA fans, jump in.			",170,63,0,15,11,1,8

												A great Lovecraftian tale that gradually unfolds with increasing dread. Your only defense against fear, insanity, and death is light, which I was able to find quite abundantly in the form of tinderboxes which are used to spark the fairly frequently encountered candelabras.  Perhaps higher difficulties reduce that frequency. Regardless, there were more than a few nailbiting moments to make this an enjoyable and frightening descent to the end (which comes all too quickly).  It is a parts-gathering and puzzle-solving type game, ala Myst, but the puzzles are fairly simple and don't detract from the story.  If you're looking for a challenging game to eat up countless hours, this isn't that. But if you're looking for an eldritch tale of otherworldly horrors, greed, murder, and madness, this is worth picking up.			",45,11,0,15,3,0,12

												This is my absolute favourite game off all time. Immersion is what this game does best, which is the result of all parts of this game going well together. Examples of these parts are the minimal interface (even the crosshair can be turned off), the ability to interact with almost everything, the fact that the game doesn't lagg even on very bad computers and the perfectly timed and well-suited soundtracks and ambience sounds. I consider Frictional Games a company that uses games as a way to tell a story. The storyline of this game fascinates me, there's little I don't know about it and I'm always up for discussion. The game might only be about 4 to 7 hours long, but I've played it at least 7 times. Combined with the hundreds of fan-made 'custom stories' that I've played, I must be at over 300 hours played right now. If you need any more information, type the name of this game on Youtube and my video will probably pop up as one of the first. I did a full non-commentary playthrough back in 2012, and am always responding to the comments. ",92,39,2,12,7,0,6

												You will need to have a defibrillator at hand when playing. I warn you now. Luckily my dad works at the hospital :DThis game made me♥♥♥♥♥♥myself like 50 times. It was so scary I wish I could stop playing But so addictive and fascinating I never was able too. I know I have only a few steam hours at the moment but I have had about 20 hours in the non steam version. Finding out the dark mysteries and storyline is absolute fun and one of the best written stroylines ever in my opinion. Best amnesia game too. And the game is old but still amazing with even many fun concepts that I havent seen before in most games. Like throwing a table infront of the door to stop the shadow getting in and mutilating you. It may seem simple but it still amazes me.9/10 Definitley worth it aslong as you dont mind having your bladder permanently loosened in fear.			",105,6,1,8,3,1,12

At times  this is an incredibly scary game. You don't play this for the graphics, or novelty of the puzzles, you play it cus it's scary. Best played when you are alone, late at night and in the dark.

												This is one of the scariest games in recent memory. The loading screen recommends you turn the lights off and play with headphones, something I'll strongly echo. Amnesia: The Dark Descent's puzzles aren't especially impressive and the voice acting can range from convincing to goofy, but the atmosphere Frictional has infused into the experience is as powerful as they come. It's a tale of terror that's menacing and disturbing from the very first moments, and only amplifies the further you progress. Any fan of horror, every Lovecraft fan, and any with even a hint of curiosity should give Amnesia a shot. Few games are able to conjure up an atmosphere this genuinely frightening.

												Amnesia is an awesome horror game that replaces jumpscares with a creepy, immersive atmosphere. The game includes a lot of puzzles which aren't insanely complex but still require a decent amount of intelligence to complete. Personally I think the story is great, lots of information is scattered around the halls of Brennenburg in the form of notes. These notes are often accompanied by the great dialogue that makes an appearance in the game every so often. The voice acting is brilliant but unfortunately it's not featured as much as I would like it to be, simply because there is a small amount of characters. And of course the monsters... the monsters play a huge role in the game. As if the terrifying atmosphere wasn't enough you will also be filled with paranoia knowing that there could be a monster waiting behind every door you open, every corner you peek around. Arguably the best thing about the game is ""Custom stories"", there are thousands of levels to download online that are made by the community so that you can keep playing even after you have completed the main story! If you want a horror game that will keep you constantly frightened, but also curious to discover what will happen next then you should definitely try out Amnesia.OverviewPros- Absolutely terrifying atmosphere (better than cliché jumpscares, imo)- Great story- Awesome voice acting- Community made levels, often have amazing stories.Cons- Puzzles sometimes become tedious- No combat (This boils down to preference)			",103,9,2,9,9,1,5

												I'll start by putting the pieces in one by one on how GREAT this game is.     First off is the story. You know, a lot of game developers don't make ""amnesia"" a good cliche. On fact, when game devs have amnesia, it usually has that character never remember anything at all in the end of a game and leaves gamers with more questions than answers. Other games have characters remember things until the very end of the game (not going to name games in case of spoilers). But this game starts with a man named Daniel, who wakes up with no memory inside of a castle. He finds a note to the Daniel that remembers. Daniel starts to constantly find notes to himself and starts to remember who he really is. While he is trying to find out who he is, Daniel is on a quest to do what the first note said. To kill a man named Alexander. As Daniel treks through the humongous castle, his sanity starts to fall down and he starts finding strange phenomena like a monster stalking his every move. Daniel must kill Alexander... before his sanity kills himself. This dark story will have you scared to go in the dark, and what the darkness might hold for you.     Next up, the gameplay. The gameplay takes the same of a survival horror genre. You need a lanter to light up your way AND to not lose your sanity, for sanity is the key to how much monster encounters you will get. While being ""hunted"", you are forced to decide wether to run or hide. Hiding is a great option when there are props everywhere to hide yourself in. If you have no place to hide, well♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can try to crouch your way around the monster, or you can YOLO and sprint but have to remember that he can hear footsteps. When you are at these spots where the monster can be around every corner, you will be in corridors, light or dark, with very dark, distorted, music. Leaving what horror is supposed to be about. The suspense. The suspense this game gives you is nerve-wracking. I was in so much suspense playing this game, I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when someone made a Skype call. What part I love about the gameplay is that they will have rooms that are for puzzles and gaining your sanity back so you can go back in and get scared again. Kind of reminds me of Silent Hill: Shattered Memories.     Next, the graphics. Who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the graphics?     The last part will be the custom stories. SOME people can make GREAT custom stories. I have played a lot of custom stories and all of them are unique in their own way, either making it for a great story, made to scare people, or just to have some fun with you and your friends. Some custom stories were even more scary than the original story. Want to play Amnesia but don't want to play the real story? No problem just slap a custom story in your files and play away! For those who want to play a custom but do not know how to install them, this video should help you.

												Immersion is often a difficult task to achieve in the world of video games, and it is here where ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" is the prime example of how to do it right. Especially where a mechaic like ""sanity"" is so rarely used in the horror genre, ""Amnesia"" is unlike any other: it is brutal, creative, and has some of the best sound quality I've ever heard in a game. The puzzles are fun, and the monsters terrifying; even when the scares might become repeative, they are enough to draw your breath away everytime. When it comes to horror, ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" is simply one of the best, and is a must-play for any wanting a story to get you thinking, and an atmosphere to give you nightmares.

Even though I have never enjoyed horror games I truly would recommend this game.

												an epic adventure, high modding capability with various options involved in where u can see as custom story. Good riddles and legendary atmosphere, what u would wanna have comes with it..Gameplay,story, ambience, story development, the horror, anything u may need...definitely a must!the only problem as you may guess is the same that u may see in horror games tho, replayability. you end the main story and its over. although u have the chance of multiple endings, it does not save the repetative feeling once u set foot in the halls of Brennenburg.Whatsoever, actually behind the customizable stories apart from the main one should be a hand not to give limited access to the game from the gamers' side. You  can easily mod the game and enjoy your time.			",135,18,3,20,10,0,24

												With everything you've already heard about Amnesia, know this - you can only take its hype so far. Yes, it's a delightfully scary game with a real sense of accomplishment after every puzzle you complete and monster you run from. But it's not so scary that you should immediately dismiss it if it's ""not your genre"" or you're ""too scared"". Any adult gamer owes it to themselves to pick up this game up if only for how well it is able to create a believable atmosphere with simplistic visuals, conveying information through text (an obvious limitation), and one of the best-sounding indie games of its time. AAA titles and indie games that want to venture into horror game making can take something out of this from a sound design standpoint. Visually, it's delicious. The textures and effects work to display an ominous ancient castle in the 1880s with a steampunk aesthetic for its puzzle elements. The use of props, mechanics, and an inventory system works. It doesn't fare against today's AAAs, but it's going to look damn good on whatever you're playing it on. If you also play it on the correct brightness level (you'd only be cheating yourself), it adds another level of immersion. The puzzle mechanics are great, but can get needlessly redundant and complex if you don't read some of the lore. If the papers are in the Notes section, they're worth reading. Sprinting mechanics and how the controls work when you're going insane felt strangely natural. Monsters spooked. The pick up, throw, and move object controls were also relieving - sometimes you just wanted to hurl a chair, a skull, or a body of other props in the air for no good reason other than to see it fly away. The only way you could tell this was a budgeted game was through its use of limited narration in its story texts. Most information is conveyed through what's written down on pieces of paper, and a limited voiceover from a few characters on a few documents (not all are voiced over) made me lose interest. But there were times in the journey where the your world would slow so that the protagonist could remember moments that were mostly delivered only through dialogue and sound. Those moments more than balanced out the chunks of text that were both spoken and unspoken. With its limited scope and mechanics for it being a budgeted title, the length felt right. It has 3 types of endings, which fit within its lofty lore that surrounds it. The checkpoint system was forgiving, and I wouldn't have had that any other way. Another gripe was that once you died or initially encountered the same few monsters, it felt less spooker than I anticipated. But the scores and sound cues that accompanied their presence hooked me back into it. TL:DR++ P H E N O M E N A L  sound design in every step in the process, whether you're using on board audio or a top-notch sound card. + Short, but sweet game w/ interesting puzzles+ Fresh spin on old environments with great visuals+ Simple mechanics in a complex world+/- Most information delivered through text, can feel a bit like a visual novel at points- Characters not as memorable as the setting, which I found to be a missed opportunity- Monster interactions got tedious and boring at points8.5/10 - A great game for anyone coming from any genre background. This game also has a semi-active modding community on modDB that can provide tens of hours of new stories and campaign that reaches from Amnesia's rich backstory. One of my best Humble Bundle fringe purchases to this date.			",291,42,3,23,15,3,8

												Great game. Music, atmosphere, design, they're all good.The only drawbacks that I found are:A) The puzzles, some are very obscure, while others are almost a copy of a previous oneB) The enemies, there are very few and their AI could be betterC) The ending is weak compared to the tension builtI still recommend getting it, specially if you're into survival horror.

												Amnesia is a great horror game because things don't just pop out of nowhere and try to scare you, you hear them coming and the thrill of running away and climbing up ladders and shutting doors before the monsters get you is actually pretty intense. Plenty of puzzles and problem solving activities that aren't too hard but just hard enough to enjoy doing. A lot of weird scenery as well. Also comes with the ""Justine"" mode, when you die, you have to restart a short story, straight into the action and very thrilling.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you like the warm feeling of crap in your pants? Well, play Amnesia and enjoy. A truly unnerving experience from the sick people who also made Penumbra. Amnesia: The Dark Descent isn't the sort of game that goes for cheap scares; it's way more interested in getting deep under your skin and making you feel stressed out about what could be behind every door and in every dark corner.

												One of the scariest games of all time. As someone who values a good survival horror game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of the greatest. The game has no combat function and forces you to flee from your enemies within a dark castle located somewhere in the woods of Prussia. You play as Daniel, a man who has no memory of who he is, but who has left a note to himself describing the terrifying shadow which follows you along with your main mission, which is to kill a man named Alexander.The game play mechanics are fantastic. If you are in a dark area for too long, you will start to lose your sanity and hallucinate. You are able to remedy this by using tinder boxes to light candles and torches along the way. If, however, you look directly at the monster who constantly pursues you, you lose a great deal of sanity almost immediately. The lack of combat leaves you feeling vulnerable and scared as you turn each corner of the castle, dreading what may be around the turn. Instead of fighting, you are forced to run and hide from your assailant, which I found refreshing, although there have been many titles to repeat this after this game was released. Overall, this game is great. If you are a fan of horror games, you won't want to miss this one.			",87,13,1,6,14,0,9

												This game uses Lighting, Sound and the darkness to install fear into the player. Right when the game makes you think you are safe, it throws a enemy around the corner or near you so when you walk around collecting tinder boxes you suddenly come up to a beautiful (Sarcasm) chap with a huge mouth and a claw that says ""This is going to hurt"". You cannot defend yourself which adds to the fear factor and you have to use the darkness itself to hide from your enemies, not many video games can say they are scary, but Amnesia can say it with Pride.Amnesia is one of the only games that actually made me vomit with fear.

												I was gifted this game off of a friend after viewing some playthroughs and expressing my interest in trying to play the game myself, and needless to say, I didn't find myself disappointed. Just as I believe the creators of Amnesia wanted, the game was atmospheric and compelling from start to finish. What I have in high regard about this game is the use of wit to survive rather than fighting skills, alongside it's several small puzzles and memory trips that added to the game. As for the actual gameplay itself, the entirety of the game ran smoothly and was more than easy to get to grips with, although I was stupid and didn't actually realise you could sprint until over halfway through the game (its Shift + W by the way.) On the contrary, the only thing I'd personally alter about this game is the detail of the storyline and lack of  interaction. I'm aware that the isolation of the games main character is what adds to the atmosphere, but some kind of interaction would've made the storyline a lot more interesting for me, rather than a dozen flashbacks and lengthy notes/diaries. As a person who enjoys progression in a game a lot more than having to read long-winded notes and excerpts, I feel as though this would've been what could of made the game for me, but that's a matter of opinion. Either way, the storyline is easy enough to understand without reading a single note anyways, which is a good plus to the game. I found that generally, Amnesia's story was somewhat fascinating and original, but the normal ending that I had experienced was a little disappointing after 11 hours of gameplay and not as intense as I'd of expected. Whilst a few things let me down within the game, these are all minor/opinions, and there is nothing legitimate at fault. I'd recommend this game as a must-play for any horror fan to try out at least once.			",4,0,0,2,0,0,0

												Its really a crying shame there aren't any movies being made these days that give me a deep sense of fear and trepidation like Amnesia The Dark Descent and so am eternally grateful to the game developers who continue to push the boundries of the horror genre.A great many games have been released since this game was iniatially launched and yet few stack up to its standard, as old as the game is its graphics don't fail to impress not a moment went by that I didn't take a moment whilst hiding in a dark corner or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥myself in a wardrobe to take in the ambience of the dark, twisted environments my poor character had the gross misfortune to find himself in.The pure malevonance of the castle I was trapped in was only further imbued by terror due in no small part to the downright twisted ambient music flowing through my Turtle Beaches and into my head causing me to proceed more cautiously and with a sense of pure anxiety that had me sweating so much it felt as though I would slip right off my chair at any moment.With a non-invasive UI that didn't take away from the gameplay and an easy to use inventory system the only problem I found was rationing my supplies as to not get caught in the dark without a light source or a rapidly diminishing mental state, which would leave my character crippled with fear or worse.For those who like fast gameplay and linear storylines, this game is not for you if however you love a solid story that plumbs the very depths of human darkness and surviving my the skin of your teeth, not to mention quaking in terror at an effective horror title then step on in and enjoy the ride, I promise you, you won't be disappointed.

												Amnesia The Dark Descent Is an imersive atmospheric horror game that offers thrills and terror by the boat load. The game is beautifully made and has a great story line. One of it's strong points is the use of the atmoshere which keeps you on your toes at all times.Amnesia takes you into the dark gloomy world where monsters chase you and you have no way to defend instead you must run. While other games offer you cheap thrills accompanied by arsenals of weapons, Amnesia offers a different alternative. you are unable to resort to fighting back,  you must escape and figure out what is going on. Why have you been put in this position? What looms in the dark?Amnesia is a fantastic first person horror survival game that I would reccomend to anyone looking for a good scare and a good story. With its modest pricing one can not go wrong on this title.Ticklepants			",367,75,1,34,18,5,30

												Not only is this one of the best horror games out there, it is also one of my favourite steam games. Even after completing the main story multiple times, I still have the urge to complete it again. Despite knowing the levels like the back of my hand, it still provides me with a nervous and always unsettling feeling while playing. The lore is also very interesting. Not to mention that custom stories are in plentiful supply. The reason why it exceeds so well is simply because of the gameplay and well implemented immersion. Whenever someone says ""Dead Space is so scary OMG"", I want to kill myself. Amnesia is so amazing and terrifying because you are defenseless, unlike Dead Space. You cannot fight back against the enemies in this game, which is why you're heart is always racing. It's such a simple concept yet it's so effective. This game will be remembered for a long time. Even if you aren't a horror person, you should definitely give this a try. It's a fantastic gaming experience.P.S. Play with headphones!			",49,16,0,3,3,1,4

												Amnesia succeeds as a horror game because it realizes a few things...Firstly, you are helpless. You can only run and hide. Monsters are much more  terrifying when you are unable to defend yourself.Secondly, Amnesia realizes that what you CANNOT see is far more terrifying than what you CAN see.

												Whenever someone asks me what Amnesia: the Dark Descent is, I tell them it is the scariest game they will ever play. I stand by that assessment. I tried to play through it two years ago; I got an hour into the game, saw one of the monsters, and hid in a closet (in the game) until it went away. I decided to take a break and come back to the game a little later. Two years later I finally came back to the game and I have finished it!Amnesia is scary not through jump scares and carefully scripted events, but through the oppressive and tense atmosphere that is constantly pressing in on you. This is the kind of scary that really affects me, because I tend to psyche myself up more than any scripted events will. It also means that you will only be scared if you let yourself become immersed in the environment; this is why I played in a dark room, alone, with headphones on whenever possible.You play as Daniel, who wakes up in an old Prussian castle with no memories of who he is. You soon find a note to yourself that kind of explains the situation. Apparently there is a bad man named Alexander in the bowels of the castle, and you have to go down there and kill him. There is also a Shadow hunting you, breaking down reality; you cannot fight it, your only choice is to run and hide.Lighting plays a critical role in this game. Not only does it determine how far you can see, but if you spend too much time in the darkness Daniel will start to lose his sanity, and then you can't trust the things he sees. To combat this you can light candles in the environment with tinderboxes and you can use your lantern. You have to be careful not to use too many tinderboxes or oil though, which adds another layer of tension.You can get sanity back by solving puzzles and progressing through the game. Most of the puzzles force you to explore and find items in areas that you would probably rather avoid.It took me seven and a half hours to complete the game. I am glad that it wasn't longer, because by the end I was starting to recognize the mechanics underlying the puzzles and monsters, and I was having trouble immersing myself as much as I had in the beginning.Obviously if you don't enjoy scary movies you won't want to pick this game up, but if you do I highly recommend Amnesia: the Dark Descent. It is well worth the $20 price tag.			",216,87,1,26,10,3,40

												A study in fear!Great ""lovecraft-ish"" gothic atmosphere and an inability to fight back the game's monsters are what make Amnesia so unique in the survival horror genre, despite the heavy antagonism it has.In itself, Amnesia offers a great horror story, in which the player is put in the very shoes of the game's protagonist, who, as the title suggests, suffers from amnesia and, much like the player, has no idea where he is and what he is doing, all set in a huge and magnificent gothic castle.Adding to the atmosphere we have the game's awesome soundtrack, with its silent to very tense sounds, up to the Terror Meter track (seriously, click 'n' listen to it!), which represents the epitome of Amnesia's scary soundtrack, as it is the game's own way of telling you that a monster has seen and is chasing you!Speaking of the game's enemies, the variety is quite small: 3 types of monsters (a basic one, a stronger one and an invisible water one) and a final (easy) boss fight, but believe me when I say they are more than enough when you are running for your life, with your heart beating like crazy, desperate to find a place to hide!And that brings me to the game's most distinctive feature: the lack of any weapon whatsoever and thus of any effective way to kill the monsters, which is what truly makes the game this scary (though, truth be said, there IS an indirect way to kill the monsters and that is to stand on a high top, close to a precipice and then lure the monster to catch you, leading it to its fall.. I managed it once, felt really good)!A testament of the game's scariness is in the fact that this is one of the very few games I played with a walkthrough open for almost the total duration of it, in order to anticipate the monsters' attacks (never did it before on games like Doom 3, Dead Space etc., where you could always blast any monster away with your super guns), such is the feeling of fear Amnesia emanates (the Prison level has to be one of the most scary and dark levels ever!).Assisting this scary feature is also the game's darkness, a darkness unlike any other you have ever seen (tops even the one in Doom 3, though only by a little, since the protagonist's eyes adjust to the darkness when you are left with no light at all, much like it would happen in real life, quite an awesome feature) and which makes you really value the oil lamp and tinderboxes you are provided!Even your sanity is measured in the game, aside from your health, which increases the more you meet monsters and stay in the darkness!As the game progresses and the pile of bricks amasses, you learn more and more about the castle's story and what happened to the protagonist in the way a true H.P. Lovecraft tribute should be, while (some of) your choices affect the game and can bring you up to 4 different endings!As a final note, don't miss the game's free DLC, Amnesia: Justine, which features a 19th century ""Saw""-like story. Seriously, it has everything to remind you of that: an abducted character that wakes up in a cell with no idea of when and what, a recorded phonograph with instructions from the abductor for his ""game"", the choice to save other abducted prisoners and alter your ending and a final great twist. Of course the horrid monsters that can chase and kill you on the spot are present, with still no (direct) means to kill them and, to make things more tense, there is also no way to save your progress in this DLC, but it's lifespan is short anyways.To complete your experience, read the Amnesia: Remember short stories as well, also given for free with the game in a pdf file.I'll be sure to play the game's sequel someday, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, though I'll let quite some time pass first, to have the experience sink a bit more.Final verdict: totally recommended for survival horror fans, especially those that want to try something different in the genre!

												So it has been 6 years since this game release and does it holds up? Well to be honest with you I don't play a lot of horror games because it is not my cup of tea. I play it mostly to amuse myself but after playing this game it really holds up good. The game shines by its uneasy atmosphere and the developers really did a great job doing that. I feel everytime when I get into some unsettling creepy section room I say ""I want to get out man, where's the exit."" I don't usually get really scare but man some part of the game just gives me an intense feeling whenever something bad is about to happen, spook me a few times just by hearing random noise.STORYI will say this that story isn't the strongest suit especially from the beginning. You will get lost of what the hell is the main character talking about his notes and additional dialogue that you either care or don't and just want to move on your destination. Though in the middle or even at the end you'll start to atleast understand what this whole story is about once you collect enough notes of the diary and when you really want to get invested of the story than you can read it whole in Daniel's dairy. I sort of got bored midway through Daniel's rambling till almost the end I finally took notice of the lore and I took an interest of it so is not the most boring if you can persevere the plot. Now one thing I find it amusing of the plot is Daniel's persisted to kill Alexander even if it means to going through danky sewers, subjecting to smell rotten food and corpses, while running away those grunts (which I called them Big Lip ""Monster moment"" since they appear for a moment and dissapear on the next,) and all kinds of monsters out there. I got to give him credit though for being that brave, I would just high tail out of here telling the constable the whole story and never set foot on that castle again!ENEMIES I will tell you now there are practically little enemies in this game but the biggest enemy you have to watch out for; is your sanity, with no weapons to defend and you know what it works perfectly! Yeah I wish there are atleast two more enemies because I got a little tired of looking that big lip grunts all the time and once you hear that screech you know is avoid, hide, don't hear the music building up, move on and repeat. Thankfuly once again the atmosphere and your sanity meter helps you build up fear to those three monsters in hair standing moments. Because the only monster I didn't find it scary is the invisible water monster, that creature had potential but ultimately you just don't touch the water and you're good to go. The brute I only see once in my first playthrough and I only look at him for a second! Base of what I heard about him, he's a tougher version of the grunt that is all. I understand the game's purpose of no weapon and you must hide from the monsters, but sometimes I find it funny through Daniel's observation that why couldn't he atleast use some of the tools that looks assualt enough to attack them, or atleast throw it. (I thought when I grab the crow bar I would be like Gordon Freeman, turns out I was wrong and decide to throw at the grunt...big mistake.) I guess Daniel son hasn't learn self-defence yet.HEALTH/SANITYThe 2nd key point of the game is keeping your sanity in check because if you don't you will start hallucinate and your vision will become drunk as demoman himself! Though honesty I find the sanity meter a bit dissapointment than it is ""ooooh gotch I better keep that in check"" Because drunken vision and seeing cockeroach with blood on walls doesn't help me become scare it just makes me have to wait till my brain is less insane and then I move on to the next. Eternal Darkness from the gamecube did it better in terms of sanity effect because it just breaks the 4th wall of the game and it was awesome! Light apparently is essential for keeping that meter check so always carry tinder and oil. You won't believe how chill moments when you find out you only have little oil and only one can left, ss a good feel of conservative! But sadly that sort of taking away the meaning of light when your sanity anyway will drop fast just by a sudden event you did or that shaky earthquake that my meter goes down fast. I don't know if I'm thinking wrong but to me it happens to me always especially even if my head is clear, a grunt appear and is bad to having that pounding headache.Don't get me started with the health meter, the health meter is practically useless. Why? Because almost nothing can kill you except the enemies. Those red blog things that hurt you, it won't kill you, falling from ledges, nope trust me I tried many times to test it unless you hurt yourself repeatedly. When it said I'm bleeding badly it heals back to bruise and cuts so having that laudanum is pretty much the lease worry of your problem of your journey unless that effects your sanity meter in which case I apologies. If you get killed don't worry it will reset to the closest section you died and you'll still have your items with you.SUMMARYGreat horror game, great atmosphere and good puzzles too, though I wish they hinted the puzzles just a little more for some of the confusing puzzles but that's just a nitpick. Another good thing about this game is mod support so you will get additional fan custom stories which makes it repeatable playthroughs with different fan stories. I give it an 8/10 for still holding up to its age.			",118,28,0,15,9,0,15

												So...i heard a lot of Amnesia: The Dark Descent...one day it was for free for a day, so i decided to Download it. But I've never played it...since Halloween.""Hey it's Halloween, i should play Amnesia. Better turn of the Lights and put my Headset on!"" - Worst decision, ever. I am easily scared, i love and hate watching Horror Movies and reading Stephen King and stuff. But this is something other than a simple Movie. I played it for one Single Hour, I encountered not a Single Monster or Jumpscare but i have enough. The Game plays with your Mind, you will hear footsteps, bugs crawling on the floor and other sweet Sounds which are the best to hear while sitting in a dark room. The use of a headset had improved my nope experience.Just by Walking along a corridor i started sweating like its 30°  C + outside.The atmosphere is awesome, the gameplay fits well and overall its a really good game. But i will never play it again unless i want to torture myself^^10/10 - Would Quit because of a simple Piano playing randomly again. - I edited for the November 2016 Sale achievment.

												Of all the possible scenarios to awaken with psychological trauma, this is by far the utmost horrific one. Its dark, your heavily impared, physically and mentally beaten within an inch of life. But you cant stop and you just keep on going until the time comes you happen to soil yourself, then its until next time, haha. Anyways, to keep this short and simple, its immersive and highly terrifying in the best of ways. Being a change from your average shoot-em-ups, this one is one of the few games you can play that gets you so into the almost senseless plot of the story and its only senseless because it's not like you know why you're here, its not like you know where to go, what to do. You know one thing for sure you felt the dark and the confusion that is, Amnesia.			",112,8,3,13,10,0,2

												It's a good, but flawed, horror game. I give it an 8/10.Minor Game Mechanic Spoilers and Rant ahead:Overall it's a good game but, like so many other things, a victim of its own hype. Its frequent attempts to scare me in the beginning actually kept me from becoming fully immersed in the atmosphere. Too many times early on I'd pick up a puzzle item and hear a spooky noise, or go down a corridor and hear a spooky noise, it felt like I was on the receiving end of Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist. Of course all this spookiness affects your sanity meter, so before I knew it I've gone from crystal clear sanity to ""..."" What happens when you run out of sanity? Game over right? Nah you just go to fetal position for ten seconds and recover some sanity. There will be some creepy effects with low sanity (as seen in other games) but since sanity swings so wildly it is hard to get a good gauge on it. The monsters, while undeniably creepy, just feel like roadblocks that, with a few exceptions, dismiss themselves after a minute letting you hunker down in a place and go fetch a drink.

Quick SummaryA very recognizable horror title that doesn't rely on predictable jump scares.Purchase Verdict:  YesPoints of Interest-There's actually an interesting story at work in this game, and multiple endings can be achieved. However, it is mainly up to the player to collect journal entries and notes if they want to understand the entire story.-Creates an awesome atmosphere of paranoia and fear without relying on gimmicky jump scares.-Extremely interactive enviroment. Lots of things can be picked up, moved, thrown, pushed, etc. This adds to the immersion.-Requires player to manage their items, (i.e. oil and flint), but not to the point where it distracts from the atmosphere.-Puzzles are simple for the most part.

												Many games attempting the horror genre miss the point of horror entirely by giving you too many weapons, throwing several enemies at you and lacking pacing with a spooky atmosphere.  Well my friends, Amnesia is here and your bowels are about to betray you. The game sets you in a horrifying, dark world, eliminating the comforting heft of any weapons and pitting you against deadly enemies you must sneak around and hide from to survive, all the while solving puzzles and keeping your sanity in check to progress.  The game is a short one, well around 5 - 6 hours, but it took me a week to beat based entirely on the fact that I kept fearquitting, or bringing up the Steam web browser to watch stupid crap on YouTube to get my nerves back.  The story and three alternate endings have a chance to confuse a bit and it may take some paying hard attention to fully understand the story, but it's a good one nonetheless.  Fans of the horror genre, your search is finally over.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yeah im terrible at horror games, you see those 9 hours I have played of this, they are me at the beginning of the game, the furthest I have gotten is when the elevator breaks and your stuck in an area of pitch blackness, really when I say I am bad I mean it, I will complete it eventually and probably record it I might regret saying that, but from what I have played its a great game, so get it if you enjoy horror.

												Okay. Where to begin? First of all, this game is scary. VERY scary. But not the sort of scary that you see in modern horror like when you turn around and the monster's appeared right behind you and a loud noise plays sort of scary. It relies more on stealth, and the fear comes from the anticipation of being found by the monster(s). Also, add in that if you hide in the darkness too long you start going mad and hallucinating all sorts of awful things, it becomes just that much more tense. Second of all, the story is AMAZING. It's not like the sort of story where you walk down straight corridors and it's explained to you in cutscenes. Oh no. You have to look around the castle for notes that explain the story, but not in order. You will find one note that explains the nature of your friendship with Alexander in Castle Brenenburg, then you will find a note some levels afterward that explains why you went to castle Brenenburg in the first place. Oh, and if you avoid hunting down the notes, you will be very confused towards the end. And as incentive to hunt down these notes, they restore the player's sanity (if I remember correctly). Thirdly, the graphics. While they may not be the highest resolution or highest poly, the castle and everything in it looks damn good. The best part of all was the lighting. The devs clearly knew how different forms of lighting affects the human mind, making a simple shower room look like a gateway into hell. That is, until you bring up your lantern or use a tinderbox. All in all, this is probably the best horror game. Ever. Better than F.E.A.R., or Slender: The Eight Pages, or any of those countless horror flash games on the web. While in those games, you simply walk from point A to B and watch jumpscares happen in cutscenes, in Amnesia, you will feel like you are Daniel, and you will understand his motivations and his many flaws, and you will feel in peril during the entire game. 10/10			",72,9,0,9,5,0,6

												For me the last hope in horror genre.The thing is that you dont have weapons and you need to hide from incoming monsters, thats true horror.It has a really good story too and the gameplay mechanics are just awesome.Sadly Amnesia 2 is nothing like Amnesia: The Dark Descent so you should get this instead if you plan on getting Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.

												It's one of the scariest games I've ever had the (dis)pleasure of playing.  I'm normally not one for the horror genre, but this flavor of it is something that sinks in deep with me.  That psychological despair which lingers with you throughout the entire story, and the dread of being hunted.  Honestly, it doesn't get any better than that, and Frictional Games knows it.  Admittedly, the scare tactic in this game gets a bit predictable after a while, and the levels aren't anything spectacular.  Where this game really hits home is the ambience; it alone will fill you with unease.  If you haven't played this game yet, you're missing out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Great graphics, unbelievable atmosphere, intriguing story, excellent physics, horrific creatures, indie developer and perhaps some of the best sound and lighting design in any game ever made.

												The sense of dread washing over you as you crouch in a corner in almost total darkness with your vision swimming, heart pounding and breath comes in short gasps as a humanoid creature with flayed skin instead of a jaw stands just metres away from you is more intense than any other video game has managed and if you even marginally enjoy the horror genre you owe it to yourself to pick it up.The ""Survival-Horror"" genre is losing its touch. These days, games that carry the title are much less about horror and more about things jumping out at you for a cheap scare. Even the survival aspect is often pushed to the back burner in favor of making an easier game accessible to a more general audience. As a result survival-horror fans are getting action games with a few scary moments shoved down their throats. Amnesia isn't like that. Amnesia focuses on three things: atmosphere, survival, and, above all else, horror. Before players start the game, a warning is given that the game should not be played to win. It should be played to allow one's self to be absorbed into the world of Amnesia. Those that follow this advice will be in for the ride of their life. From the very beginning of the game, Amnesia's immersive and completely unsettling world will have you questioning if that sound is something moving, or if you're just going insane. You'll be afraid to go around the next corner, lest something horrifying is there. But you won't be able to stop.With the recent release of the same development tool kit that the creators used to make the game, players can make their own stories. With a bit of creativity and just a bit of that sadistic love of horror, we'll be seeing good things come from Amnesia for a time to come.			",2260,866,87,236,310,22,349

												Amnesia is a game that has become infamous since its release as one of the most terrifying horror games of the past decade or so. How true that claim might be is difficult to say as fear and horror is a rather subjective issue, but to give my own experiences... I've played a lot of horror games in my time, and Amnesia is definitely one of my top favorites, as well as one of the few to genuinely disturb me while playing.You play as Daniel, a British artifact curator who has come into the company of a Prussian baron, Alexander of Brannenburg, in the early 19th century. For reasons initially unknown to you at current, Daniel and Alexander have had a falling out, resulting in Daniel consuming an amnesia-inducing potion and leaving a letter to himself telling him to seek out Alexander in the depths of his castle and kill him. As Daniel progresses through the castle, he experiences flashbacks and memory relapses which combined with journal notes and cryptic loading screen texts tell Amnesia's story. The entire thing is very DIY and requires the player to be attentive, as only the basics of the plot are handed out easily to the player. However, the end result is well worth the effort, as the bigger picture coming together creates a realization that only adds to the horror of the game.What makes Amnesia's horror stand out, however, is the dynamic which light and darkness have an effect on Daniel as you creep through Brannenburg castle. The longer you stay in the darkness (and this game gets PITCH BLACK DARK), the more your sanity drops. As your sanity drops, your controls become loose, vision becomes warped and distorted, and Daniel may hallucinate things that are not there, causing delays. When his sanity gets too low, he essentially buckles over onto the floor and collapses in a paranoid heap for a long while, leaving you vulnerable. The remedy to this is to stay in lit areas, which slowly restores sanity. However, staying in the light is dangerous as it makes you visible to any monsters that are creeping nearby and they will make short work of you if seen. This contradictory dynamic makes the entire game a stress inducing nightmare where you must constatly think about when it is safe to stay in the light and when you need to hide and lose sanity, as well as managing your limited supply of tinderboxes to lighten up candles which can either provide you with a safe haven or deny you a place to hide should you come across an enemy. You are never truly safe, but you always have some control over your situtation, and this dynamic is what makes Amnesia stand out from other horror games, especially ""helpess"" ones where you can not fight back.There are other elements which add to the experience of the game, namely atmosphere, sound design, and disturbing imagery, and all of them are utilized fairly responsibly to deliver an unnerving experience. The game is largely built around simple to modest adventure game style puzzles, which a fair amount of exploration and searching involved to find what you need. It isn't the most inventive or intuitive problem solving, but it gets the job done and does not distract from the core attraction of the game which is the fear and horror. The story is top notch in my opinion and the characters of both Daniel and Alexander are well fleshed out and written, and as said before piecing together the story whole adds a whole new layer to the fear in the game. The main destriment is honestly the consequences of death, or real lack thereof. Getting killed does little to punish you for your mistakes, except the loss of items you may have used in a vain attempt to survive beforehand. Otherwise the game treats death as a light slap on the wrist and resets you at the most recent save point, which is often the door you just came in through. That said, the actual fear of one of the monsters coming at you and slicing you up can make up for it, perhaps. Lastly, Amnesia supports custom modules for unique, player-made games and there are plenty of top-quality ones out there to try, so even after the game loses its luster there are fresh new terrors to experience, many of them providing their own unique twists and scares.If you're a fan of adventure games or horror games, Amnesia is definitely worth looking into. Looks past the hype and praise and instead let yourself become immersed in its story and atmosphere, and there is a good chance you won't be dissapointed. But don't play Justine. Justine is really bad.			",83,17,0,12,4,2,5

												Eerie yet gripping, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a horror based game full of mystery as a man stumbles his way towards to truth through the darkness, facing monsters and his own sanity as he goes. With no weapons or means of offense the only option is to hide and hope you're not discovered by what lurks around the corner. Turn off the lights, turn up the volume and prepare for the descent.

												Pros:+ Immersive atmosphere+ Creepy and scary game that will have you screaming out loud+ Very well done sounds that complement the setting and increase the tension of the game+ No annoying jump scares that substitute for real horror+ Voice acting was well doneCons:- In my opinion the story could use a little more fleshing outPreferred peripheral: keyboard and mouse as controllers do not work with this game and i highly recommend wearing headphones while you play this gamePersonal Notes:I must admit that I am not someone who can sit through the original japanese version of The Ring and take it all stoically. After watching that movie, I slept with the light on for 2 weeks. Even though I am not as strong hearted as a lot of other people out there, I enjoy playing these types of games.Whereas games like Dead Space rely on jump scares, Amnesia gives me a sense of horror more akin to the horror parts of the original F.E.A.R and Fatal Frame. Being unable to defend myself heightens the sense of terror and helplessnes. I admittedly screamed out loud like a little girl on more occasions than I care to count while playing this game. I had a blast playing through it!Verdict: BUY!			",264,84,6,33,20,1,24

												A truly amazing psychological horror game, a pretty short but very well crafted storyline makes this game worth it. Even better, is at a perfect price range for what you are getting. But what really stole hours of my life away from me are the mods, this game has a very very active modding community, even now. Get it for the main story, stay for community-made stories.

												Don't mind my hours, I've played most of my time on another account.But yeah, this is one of my favorite horror games of all time. This a game from the time when horror games required more than just a defenseless protagonist and some strobe lighting (machine for pigs I'm looking at you). +Looks great (espesially lighting)+Is actually scary without having many jumpscares+The physics engine is fantastic+Sounds are the best of the best and same goes for the music+Difficulty: it's far from a walking simulator (amfp :P) but the monsters are actually very easy to avoid and they are there just to keep the game interesting+Sanity system and limited light resources±The story is ok, but it's told in paper notes so be ready to read alot. No cutscenes though...-...except the flashbacks, which are total pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when you replay the main story±Custom stories gave this game almost infinite amount of content (even though the quality of them is highly varied :P)-Has some tedious parts-The game loses a bit of its scariness every time you die-The AI doesn't exist: the monsters are programmed to patrol for short time somewhere for a couple of minutes before they vanish completely. If you are spotted, they will chase you for couple of seconds and lose their interest at the same second they don't see you anymore. If you get killed by one of them, the same monster will never respawn again.-Performance scales from very good to very bad. Most of the time I get solid 60fps, but in some large areas I get some very annoying drops. Mostly lag spikes fortunately, nothing gamebreakingIn conclusion this is a very solid horror game that has some truly freaky moments. The main story alone doesn't last for too many playthroughs, but fortunately there is still an active mod community. I'd recommend to download at least Study of insanity and Black forest castle. If you like this you should also try Penumbra series and AVOID amnesia a machine for pigs! Be sure to play in dark room with good headphones and low gamma settings :)			",53,1,0,2,2,0,2

												Eerie yet gripping, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a horror based game full of mystery as a man stumbles his way towards to truth through the darkness, facing monsters and his own sanity as he goes. With no weapons or means of offense the only option is to hide and hope you're not discovered by what lurks around the corner. Turn off the lights, turn up the volume and prepare for the descent.

												Pros:+ Immersive atmosphere+ Creepy and scary game that will have you screaming out loud+ Very well done sounds that complement the setting and increase the tension of the game+ No annoying jump scares that substitute for real horror+ Voice acting was well doneCons:- In my opinion the story could use a little more fleshing outPreferred peripheral: keyboard and mouse as controllers do not work with this game and i highly recommend wearing headphones while you play this gamePersonal Notes:I must admit that I am not someone who can sit through the original japanese version of The Ring and take it all stoically. After watching that movie, I slept with the light on for 2 weeks. Even though I am not as strong hearted as a lot of other people out there, I enjoy playing these types of games.Whereas games like Dead Space rely on jump scares, Amnesia gives me a sense of horror more akin to the horror parts of the original F.E.A.R and Fatal Frame. Being unable to defend myself heightens the sense of terror and helplessnes. I admittedly screamed out loud like a little girl on more occasions than I care to count while playing this game. I had a blast playing through it!Verdict: BUY!			",264,84,6,33,20,1,24

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is perhaps the best genuine horror game. Everything about the game plays into the horror, from the environment, the sounds changing, unsettling story and gives you a sense of paranoia and curiosity as you play. Really is the golden example of how a horror game should be. No cheap scares, just pure experience.			",57,14,0,9,9,2,3

												are you looking for a game that can work as a costapatian aid? do you love horror that makes you poo your pants? well then you have come to the right game, amnesia the dark decent have hit that spot right on, the game is second to none when it comes to scaring you, and making all of your imaginasion do most of the work for you by audio and visualisation, this game has it all.friction games have made a marvel, from the beginning to the end, you will be bombarded with visual and audio that work perfectly to nurture your imaginasion to a state of paranoia.there is no weapons in the game, so if you see a monstrosaty, run bloody run and hide to the best of your abillaty, the only aid you have in the game is a lantern and some tinderboxes to light your way in this dark castle of terror, but oil is scarce, so use the lantern wisely, but if your thinking, ""hey, lets just dont use the light so that we can hide in the shadows"" not a chance, the monsters cant see you in the dark, but there is a sanety meter that goes haywhire if you stay in the dark for to long, and makes you halucinate, and if you go dot dot dot ont the sanety meter, the monsters will find you, so its a balance, amnesia is by far one of the greatest game i have played in a long time, so for me, its a solid 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really cool game, very fluid controls that are unique yet can easily be adapted to. Captivating gameplay and intreguing story. Beside a haunted castle it is very unique in that respect. Although it isnt very scarry at all in my opinion, it is a good game for other reasons. Namly the story and the puzzles. To adress the horror aspect: It was unnerving, i wouldent say scarry at the begining. The phantom screams and creaking could get to you, yet after a while you realized there was nothing there. So, imo it is a sespencful puzzle game with a very good story, that is not given to you directly. You slowly aquire it via voice acted notes, that let you come to your own conclutions about what really happened.Would recomend to anyone who enjoys puzzles and a spooky story.			",82,13,0,10,7,0,2

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an amazing horror game. If your looking for a great, sit-down horror game, you've got one right here. The game has amazing story, atmosphere, and artwork. The physics gameplay really stands out from other horror games... *cough cough amachineforpigs cough* The puzzles are great, the monsters are great... Well you get it, but my favorite part about this game, is it's ever-growing custom story list. Jus search Amnesia: TDD mods ModDB, and BAM! Loads of stories to choose from! (Did i mention I love this game?) Haha, if your looking for a great horror game, you should check this one out. I feel I've put more time into this game than I should have... ;)			",34,1,0,1,1,0,0

												At this point in time, there's really not much anyone can still say about Amnesia, because everything you can say about it has already been said. However, Amnesia is a game that consistently demand praise and attention, and it posses a quality that can never feel outdated, atleast not in the current sense.Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a must play game for anyone anywhere who even remotely cares about playing video games. If you're not into horror in the first place, it makes little difference, because Amnesia will eventually convert you. The game is masterfully done in just about every way that a horror game needs to be done. It provides fantastic atmosphere, a terrifying and calming soundtrack (depending on the part in the game), intense gameplay, unique mechanics, unsettling settings, and a very solid story to tie the whole game together. The enemies one encounters in this game are truly haunting, and for all the right reasons. Rather than using cheap jumpscares, the psychological horror this game employs creates genuine fear and caution towards every enemy in this game, even if you can't tell if the enemies are actually there or not. Instead of instilling distress through the physical appearance of an enemy, the developers utilized a sanity system and, upon being sighted by an enemy, sounds that will really make you consider what the true nature of frantic and desperate horror is. Fear of an enemy for being an enemy, not fear for what the enemy looks like, or because they can kill you. It's such a simple concept yet I fail to see this recur in most forms of horror fiction. All the admiration I have for the enemies constructed by the developers, yet they're still not even the games highest point.Play the game. It's worth the full price, but it goes on sale quite often. Get yourself alone, in a dark room, with headphones, and experience this genuine masterpiece.			",128,24,0,16,5,0,2

												The atmosphere is amazing in this game, other than a little bit of Penumbra (made by same developers), I can safely say I've never played anything like this game. The inability to fight back is very new to me, but it adds so much. If you're looking for a frightful experience with occasionally challenging puzzles, look no further. Just focus on immersing yourself in this eerie experience.			",153,35,0,16,10,0,17

												Amnesia, a 1st person horror-adventure, is one of the coolest (and scariest... let's not forget scariest) games I've played in a long while. There are no guns or other weapons of any kind. It's just you, locked in a creepy castle, doing whatever you can to survive to the end... which usually involves hiding and trying not to soil your pants too much. As a fan of old-school adventure games from the dawn of the genre, I very much appreciated this new modern take on things. The game has gotten lots of buzz since its release, and all of the praise is well-deserved, especially for such a small developer. If you like horror, mysteries and/or adventure games (and don't mind being scared out of your wits too much), Amnesia is a no-brainer. Two thumbs up!			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

												At a Glance: Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a Masterpiece of a horror game.  A worthy successor to Frictional Game's stellar Penumbra series, Amnesia keeps you watching your back and questioning yourself every time you go to open a door.  The gameplay is entertaining with its puzzles yet frightening as you play as our hero, Daniel, with no means of self defense.  The story is intriguing and keeps you motivated to solve puzzles and keep your sanity as you venture further into the deep walls of the Castle Brennenburg.  Extra Content:Not only did the team at Frictional Games create a free expansion for Amnesia called Amnesia: Justine, but the game contains a Custom Story function. This allows you to play countless community-made Amnesia Stories once you've installed them through Steam, Desura, or manually from ModDB.  The gameplay value is huge.Conclusion:  Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of my personal favorite Horror Games of all time.  From the beautifully detailed castle environments to the immersive atmosphere and story, this is one game that horror fans won't want to pass up.			",299,60,8,27,26,4,10

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is the pinacle of horror games for beginners. Always best when played with headphones on and up at a loudish volume, but not loud enough for your ears to bleed, leave that to public concert karaoke festivals.In Amnesia, you play as a young British man named Daniel who, well, has amnesia. He goes around finding notes and clues based on his previous thoughts, but as he collects all these things, he is simultaneousely being chased by an evil ghoulish spirit named The Manpig. This becomes more revealing of his name in the sequel, Machine For Pigs.Many young youtubers have gained exponential fame when playing this game on their let's play channels. These youtubers consist of popular names, such as Markiplier and PewDiePie.I love the setting of the game and the grim tone of it. Also the physics and ragdoll effects work amazingly. This game is a work of art in my opinion and I recommend it for anyone in the mood for a good scare or wanting to reach popularity on YouTube.			",97,22,1,13,2,0,4

												9/10Highlights: Experience, Atmosphere, Sound, and SoundtrackThe benchmark of virtual terror... This game is unlike most other survival-horror games out there. Instead of running through creepy environments with pistols and melee weapons, you're stuck with nothing but a lantern in Amnesia: the Dark Descent. This game forces you to be defenseless against the many horrific creatures within the Castle Brennenburg and because of this, you must utilize stealth-like strategies in order to bypass the monsters. On paper, the gameplay is bare-boned and easy, but what really hits the player hard is the looming fear of the unknown. Unless you've watched youtube videos or seen someone else play this game, you are going in unprepared for an environment that is unfamiliar. You are more likely to fear that which you do not see rather than what is evident.- The story is somewhat clever, however your only connection to the story is through multiple notes you find throughout the levels and several scripted flashbacks.- The game's strongest point is its emphasis on a consistently claustrophobic and dark atmosphere. This is also strengthened by the quality of sounds used within this game as they are top-notch and  fit perfectly within the stone-walled and echoey castle. Along with this, the soundtrack is absolutely fear-inducing and befitting for the environment presented.- The game's weakest point is some of the puzzle mechanics. Most of the puzzles do not require much thought to figure out, however, some can take longer than others and have a tendency to frustrate the player and draw them out of game's intended experience/atmosphere. There have been moments where I'd spend large amounts of time backtracking to find something that I may have missed.I purchased this game a long while back around when it first came out and have played through it multiple times along with player-made mods (some of which are even scarier) both solo and with groups. What I have found this game to be is the bar at which other survival horrors must meet in order to emphasize true quality in the genre. This is one game that I can always bring up in a conversation about video games since it really blurs the line between fantasy and reality.			",173,103,1,30,28,4,31

												If you want scary, play this. What is scarier than running around and fighting the hordes of hell or zomies, with a big gun? I'll tell you. Running around with no weapons and no way to fight back in a decrepit castle with monsters chasing you as you unravel a past so horrible your character drank a drink to forget it all. THAT is scary. Ok now seriously, this is a thrilling game. The atmosphere of the castle is awesome, getting darker and creepier the further you go. I'm not going to ruin the story, but lets just say you never see the twist coming. This game is literally a dark descent as you go from the main floor of a castle and travel deeper and lower into a nightmarish experience. Another dynamic is that you have to stay sane while making your poor character go through all this. From the makers of the Penumbra series (don't worry I'll review that soon, good game) this is a HUGE leap forward in terms of story and scares. As the people behind WatchMojo on Youtube say, ""Adult diapers are pretty much mandatory.""			",114,169,0,22,10,3,18

You awaken trapped inside a deserted castle, with no way out and no weapons, you can only run from one dark room to the next, trying to avoid the monstrosities that lurk the halls. Your only hope is to unearth this place's disturbing history if you want to survive the paranormal force that is chasing you, fighting to maintain your sanity as the darkness closes in. Amazingly atmospheric and excellently paced, Amnesia is a game that'll give you nightmares, and I love it!			",222,46,7,10,12,2,7

Amnesia is filled with puzzles and notes which you must read to complete the game and I'm alwayes happy when I complete one.The game is packed with creatures that just make you pee!After you get stuck on a puzzle for a while it can be a bit annoying, but when you finish them the game gets right back into the storyline.

The environment, combined with the ambience, combined with knowing that there is something out there looking for you that can show up at any moment and there is nothing you can actually do to stop it, makes for a very scary game. Aside from being scary as♥♥♥♥♥♥though, Amnesia is a good looking game, well designed game, with an interesting story. Definitely a must play for horror game lovers/enthusiasts.

												An amazing experience from start to finish. The design of the game really draws you into the mystery of the plot. Whilst the puzzle aspects are fairly straightforward, they work well together with the other gameplay features of light and the monsters chasing you. Amnesia is great example of the strengths of indie development, creating a game that feels unique and not a tired old formula of sequalitis.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a modern horror classic. In addition to this, however, it is a very good adventure game. These two genres are blended together very well. Frictional Games has truly inspired game design. Many puzzles are clever and satisfying. This is one of the scariest games ever; sound and visual effects are implemented masterfully and instill undeniable dread in the player. That there is no combat further reinforces the player's vulnerability and encourages you to play intelligently to survive. Play it with friends for a fun time. If you like this game, check out Frictional's earlier games, the Penumbra series, which are games in much the same horror-adventure style.			",338,123,8,23,59,2,75

												What can I say about Amnesia, that hasn't already been said?The game is just astounding. So beautiful and well crafted with this organic, ever changing feel to them game that, no matter how much you play, allows you to discover more and continue to get chills and scares for hours upon hours. There's never been a single player game I enjoyed as much as I have enjoyed Amnesia. The story is well done, the scares are placed and done thoughtfully, and the enviroment is so vast, even when the game takes place inside a single castle. I love the heart that was put into the game, the voice acting is wonderful and the creatures are frightening. Even now, with 52 hours on record, I can still jump into the game and get chills and thrills from it. And that was without including the in depth Custom Stories, where fans or developers can create their own wonderful horror story with the provided assets of Amnesia. So much creativity and scares, and even humor, has come from the community stories to where there is no end to the game. You can keep playing Amnesia, and experience a unique and creative take on the world a hundred times over. I love this game. It has a place in my heart as one of my favorite games of all time, and I will never stop reccommending this game.			",147,59,0,12,16,1,6

												Don't let Amnesia's reputation fool you, this isn't just another jump-scary survival horror game! It has some of that, but the real scares are pretty varied and unpredictable, and the bulk of the game is actually progressed with puzzles. Overall I'd rate it a solid 4.5/5. There are a couple of puzzles that are pretty unintuitive, while others can feel a bit *too* easy, and the occasional encounters you're supposed to avoid being noticed by are more irritating than scary, but there's still a *lot* to recommend this game over others. The graphics are lovely, the audio and controls are immersive, a lot of the concepts and monsters are honestly unsettling, and the story is well-presented and enjoyable. Plus, even though there's basically no inherent replayability, the game is longer than you'd expect!Quick Pro: Dark, immersive atmosphere.Quick Con: Stealth gameplay segments are unsatisfying.

												At first i was kind of worried. Im so use to games jump scaring me into oblivion, which i feel is pretty cheap and annoying. Amnesia is better than that and clearly showes it through the entire game. The atmoshphere is superb and the storytelling is very well done. I was overall suprised to how well done the game was from a company i never really heard about, but i hope to see many more titles in the future. The unique use of physics really put you in the characters shoes where it takes time to think while trying to figure out puzzels and how to progress through the story. Along with being chased down by the monster, which can just be around the corner at any time, it truly keeps your sense survival at a high throughout the game. Personally, this is one of the best horror games i've played in years.			",270,45,3,18,10,3,30

												So, a lot of people call this game ""the scariest game they've ever played"", and go on and on about the scariness, but I am evidence that it is totally possible to play this game without really being scared! Most of the ""horror"" of this game is just gross things (read: fleshy things) in dark rooms, which isn't really horrifying, it's just... gross stuff in dark rooms, and if that's not something that bothers you, then you'll be just fine in this game. Honestly, Daniel (the main character) is much, much more freaked out than I am! If you play this with the idea that it's a video game, and play it the same way you'd play any other video game, then it's more fun than scary! It has a cool back story and very interesting puzzles, and interesting mechanics involving keeping Daniel's mental health from deteriorating by keeping him out of the dark (which he seems to be very afraid of), and from observing disturbing events. So this is not a game where you can just run from point a to point b, you really have to think and strategize about your movements and where you go/stand to keep Daniel in a functional state. It's pretty cool and I've not played anything quite like it before! Also, rather than fighting monsters, you have to make them go away, which is also quite interesting (though there were no monsters for the entire first hour of the game and that was a bit disappointing to me), by hiding in the dark, no less! And either action, getting too close to a monster, or hanging out in the dark, will lower Daniel's sanity, so it requires some careful planning and knowing when it will be okay to come out. As briefly mentioned earlier, the story is presented in a very cool way, Daniel gave himself amnesia at the beginning and you basically have it right along with him, as you obviously don't know anything that he used to know. And as the story unfolds its like unravelling a mystery. Very cool! I also found the game a bit educational, as it takes place in the 1800's and is faithful to the time period, so I was able to look up some of the objects that are in the game and learn about what they were. All in all, this was a very enjoyable experience for me, so I give it a full recommendation! I didn't find it as scary as most people seem to, but I enjoy the gameplay and find it to be a very unique experience. I've had a lot of fun!			",68,19,3,4,6,3,5

												Great game. I had just finished playing Outlast and was looking for games with that survival horror experience. I started out looking at some Amnesia gameplays and, to tell you the truth, I really didn't care too much about the graphics and felt no tension or fearfulness. I was wrong. The game is very engaging and with a interesting narrative. It helps when you play it on a dark environment with headphones. There are like 3 different endings and lots of puzzles to solve and itens to get. So you might want to go read a walkthrough first.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game way back in 2011 or 2010 with 2 of my friends on skype. I know, the real balls play solo. But we really wanted to play it together.  I've finished it about 4 times in total with different friends (they needed to hold my hand  ;) ) but I swear to god, it was still damn scary.I have played quite a few horror games, and I must say Amnesia is one of the best atmospheric psycholocial horror i've ever played. Frictional Games are absolutely masters at it!It's not just jumpscares: it's the environment, the scenery, the distant screams and mumbling. The cracking and footsteps upstairs you hear continuesly around you. There are only slight hints that the enemy is nearby, it doesn't really tell you where to go or where it would come from. All you know what's going on is that you're in a dark room and you just wanna ♥♥♥♥ing light some candles because holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's so dark here. :') but then you would signal a monster. Welp.I absolutely recommend this game to the horror fanatics and who love something psychological to it rather than just raw scary stuff and weird slimey stuff on the walls that's  all really forced. I swear, this game really does something to you. 5/5			",65,8,2,2,2,0,2

A horrifying game that will make you feel weak and paranoid only to have you progress past the point you are (once you can move from the crippling fear) and move on with the storyline. The only disappointing part is that there are no weapons to fight the monsters chasing you, just your lantern, however the game is great and will get your heart pumping.			",59,6,0,4,6,0,3

												Frictional Games is known as a small indie developer that has had previous success in its survival-horror Penumbra franchise. Their most recent release, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, should rightfully remove that trilogy from the throne and replace it with Amnesia. The Dark Descent is an absolutely fanstastic addition to FG's catalogue given its immersive atmosphere into a truly terrifying setting. The sound, graphics and cryptic story are first rate easily leaving behind any A-list horror titles in the dust. If you enjoy an engrossing atmosphere with excellent gameplay and don't mind having to change your trousers every once in awhile then Amnesia is a MUST HAVE!			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												I played this game way back in 2011 or 2010 with 2 of my friends on skype. I know, the real balls play solo. But we really wanted to play it together.  I've finished it about 4 times in total with different friends (they needed to hold my hand  ;) ) but I swear to god, it was still damn scary.I have played quite a few horror games, and I must say Amnesia is one of the best atmospheric psycholocial horror i've ever played. Frictional Games are absolutely masters at it!It's not just jumpscares: it's the environment, the scenery, the distant screams and mumbling. The cracking and footsteps upstairs you hear continuesly around you. There are only slight hints that the enemy is nearby, it doesn't really tell you where to go or where it would come from. All you know what's going on is that you're in a dark room and you just wanna ♥♥♥♥ing light some candles because holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's so dark here. :') but then you would signal a monster. Welp.I absolutely recommend this game to the horror fanatics and who love something psychological to it rather than just raw scary stuff and weird slimey stuff on the walls that's  all really forced. I swear, this game really does something to you. 5/5			",65,8,2,2,2,0,2

												Reaching near the point of sterilization the horror genre has become rather lackluster, with most games relying on cheap jump scares or laughable amounts of gore. Thankfully Amnesia relies on neither. Creating a claustrophobic atmosphere of terror and survival, Amnesia gives a much needed kick in the cryptic womb of horror gaming.			",435,85,9,68,28,2,51

												There is an incredible slow burn for the start. All I can recommend is to not give up on it. Yes, it will be boring if you're not the sort to get into self-exploration titles. Once it picks up though, the game delivers on the frightening elements people give it credit for.With that said, play the game in the dark and at night. Seriously, even after it picks up, still feels boring if you're playing it on your couch with daylight shining through.			",188,84,3,39,15,4,26

												A great story that references real-world history and personalities and has mind-blowing twists and turns.  All while scaring the living @#%! out of you.  Be prepared for a grueling playthrough in most cases, depending on how lucky you get with the randomized monster encounters.  Best played either with a lot of friends in a room together if you want to sleep well, or alone at night with headphones if you're a masochist that's prepared to stay up all night clutching a shotgun.  If you haven't played this game yet, you need to get with the program and do it.FAIR WARNING:  I've seen things in this game that I almost wish I never had.   Squeamish players should not, I repeat SHOULD NOT read all of the books and notes inside the torture chambers.  Human beings are horrifying creatures, and the game references actual historical torture practices and devices.  While none of the acts are shown on-screen, all of the ""pre-recorded"" sounds are there alongside the in-depth descriptions of what was done.  There's serious nightmare-fuel in there that's a lot more terrifying than any of the monsters.  Word to the wise.			",73,32,0,2,3,1,4

												I have not finished this game but so far it's been one of the best games I'v ever played. Although I'm still stuck on one of the puzzles and havent had much action yet I still have a ugre  to carry on.The atmosphere is great and makes you slowly feel less and less comfortable ! Amnesia is filled with puzzles and notes which you must read to complete the game and I'm alwayes happy when I complete one.The game is packed with creatures that just make you pee!After you get stuck on a puzzle for a while it can be a bit annoying, but when you finish them the game gets right back into the storyline.

												Frictional Games is known as a small indie developer that has had previous success in its survival-horror Penumbra franchise. Their most recent release, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, should rightfully remove that trilogy from the throne and replace it with Amnesia. The Dark Descent is an absolutely fanstastic addition to FG's catalogue given its immersive atmosphere into a truly terrifying setting. The sound, graphics and cryptic story are first rate easily leaving behind any A-list horror titles in the dust. If you enjoy an engrossing atmosphere with excellent gameplay and don't mind having to change your trousers every once in awhile then Amnesia is a MUST HAVE!			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												My favorite horror game as of yet. This calls for strategic gameplay in order to survive. I love the theme, feel and graphics of this game. The story line is also amazing, you start off as a man who does not know where he is, or why he's  there. As you head down the corridors you find little clues and come across monsters  but unfortunately for you there is no way to defend yourself you must either run or hide. I feel that this makes the game much scarier, and I love it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am not good with horror games because I scared easily. I thought I was ready for this game because I watched friends play it but I was still very scared when I started playing on my own. Had to pause many times because game was very intense to me, so I think this was great horror game. I recommend this to all who want to be scared!			",123,76,4,11,13,3,13

												A very creepy but fun game. Haven't played all of it, but I can tell it is very story-driven and relies heavily on the atmosphere the areas produce. I literally screamed when I saw the first monster. I felt my spine jump, and it amazing that this game can do that to you even if your computer screen is small. It keeps you entranced in its world. As previously stated, story-driven and very atmospheric. 8/10  (but that's just because horror games aren't really my thing)			",41,2,4,6,2,1,1

												Graphics - Very good lighting, great textures, everything look creepy and very dark.Sound - absolutly unreal the game told me to use headphones but I have very nice surround sound speakers and let me tell you the sound from my speakers scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me some times. The sounds in the game give you the creeps in your skin and make ever hair on your body stand up.Gameplay - So basic just move around crouch and click on what you want to interact with. Works very well for the game. Also you dont fight back in the game you either run hide or die. UI - Very clean and basic.Setting - underground most of the game in creepy places like cellers, sewers, tunnels castels, etc...Story: well I played half the game and took a month break from it so I didnt follow the story to well but their is lots of notes in the game that explain what area your in and why things are happening. Very intersting story tho.Scary? - Let me say this: I cried a few times ;_;Fun? Let me say this: I hate wanting to play the game because i know i will♥♥♥♥♥♥myself but love every moment of it. 9/10 for story gameplay and true horror without adding lots of blood and guts.

												An excellent piece of digital-interactive artwork that uses the 4 essesntial elements of gaming (algorithm, player activity, interface, graphics) to spectacular degrees, all in order to deliver the scares and overwhelming creepiness of an experience that makes a game a true survival horror. The claustrophobic blackness of every step you take along with your character's (Daniel's) frequent gasps and whimpers over the incessant hauntings and attacks you endure throughout the campaign build a disarming immersion into a ghastly world all the advertisements and reviews of this game have promised. Although all your struggles charging through the game are inevitibly concluded with any one of the three rather disappointing endings, the sweat and shivers the whole shebang (quite effectively) offers makes it an experience totally worth a sappy resolution to forget about underneath the terrific fog of memories you'll make with the genuinely frightening gameplay and set pieces.

												The monsters in this game are great, OP even. You cannot attack them, only hide or run from them. Even just looking at them makes you slowly go insane. The various puzzles and the way you interact with the objects around you are quite nice as well.The story is okay. The few times you are being chased are great. However, the final encounter, if you can even call it that, is quite awful; you'd expect a boss, a fight, something, but instead you get to knock over some pylons and hear some naked zombie complain about it.Also, you can't really die in this game; if you do, you will respawn close by with no penalty whatsoever, which is not very cool.Overall 6/10			",247,43,11,23,13,4,27

												This game will forever be known as one of the heralds of horror's resurgance in video games. Actual horror, not ""gun + zombies"" action. (Gun + zombies can be fun and well-made, of course, but it is not horror.)Although others games have come out which learned lessons from Amnesia and improved upon the execution, this game is still worth picking up when its on sale. For those who have an interest in the history of video games, though, it's a must-buy.			",105,54,2,40,9,1,12

 Positive + Downright disturbing story, with notes obtainable throughout the game only further detailing gruesome details of events that have taken place+ Great voice acting all-around (most notably Sam A. Mowry as Alexander)+ The well-developed physics engine allows for some entertaining puzzles and interaction with the environment+ Some good lighting effects help to punctuate the necessity of keeping out of the dark. Negative - Some poor gameplay mechanics: most notably the sanity system, which only sets out to hinder your progress rather than immerse you into the game; and even when I liberally used the lantern throughout the game, I was never close to running out of oil nor tinderboxes- While the game does manage to retain a fearful atmosphere for the most part, in actuality there are only around 5 or so enemies that can actually harm/kill you, which makes the possibility of death inconsequential and reduces the overall ‘scariness’ of the game Verdict “Amnesia: The Dark Descent does manage to effectively replicate a scary atmosphere and tell a good story, which many gamers have recognised. However, the game would have been much better suited in another format (most notably a book), as it seems that--in its current form--it is more of an interactive story than an actual game. Nevertheless, the overwhelmingly unnerving experience alone is worth a playthrough.” 7/10 TJBs  ",336,61,9,32,4,1,8

												The game which put indie horror games on the map. When it comes to the horror game genre, it really doesn't get any better than Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The game is amazing. It's got a great story, a creepy enviroment, but where it really shines is it's atmosphere.The story's great, but when you've finished it (or if you're just feeling a bit tired of the main game) there are hundreds of custom stories made by the community for you to enjoy. Overall, it's just a sick game.Amnesia: The Dark Descent is still my favourite horror game and i couldn't recommend it more. If you're a horror game fan like myself this is a must have.10/10★★★★★ ",183,38,1,14,6,0,3

												After beating A Machine for Pigs I decided to move on to this game,and I can say that this game is as good as that game,if not better :)The game centers around this man named Daniel who has a bit of a case of Amnesia(hence the title),and thwarts the plans of Alexander,one man who used to be his friend until Daniel found out about his real plansFor those that have seen a bit of gameplay/other reviews,you may know that this game has puzzles,and PLENTY of them.I honestly have to say that my first time playing I just gave up when I got to the lab puzzle because of how bad I was at the game back then(xD),but after some pointers from my friend who completed the game before,and some prior knowledge from guides I saw and videos I saw I managed to beat the puzzles :),and overall the puzzles aren't too hard,so long as you know what you're doingThe atmosphere(which is typical in a horror game like this)is plentiful and actually managed to scare me in some parts,along with the monsters*looks at the water monsters*.The music is good,not much else to say about the music.The gameplay is great overall,kinda going with the puzzle stuff I mentioned earlier.You also get this lantern that once you run low on oil with you of course need to refill it,there's certain cases where you actually don't want your lantern out otherwise a monster will spot you and chase you(and possibly kill you xD)Overall this is a great horror game that I recommend to everyone for those that are looking for a really really good indie horror game,I guess my only complaint at all(and it's a small one)being the difficulty of some of the puzzles9.5/10 from me :)			",121,25,1,11,4,1,4

												Graphics - Very good lighting, great textures, everything look creepy and very dark.Sound - absolutly unreal the game told me to use headphones but I have very nice surround sound speakers and let me tell you the sound from my speakers scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me some times. The sounds in the game give you the creeps in your skin and make ever hair on your body stand up.Gameplay - So basic just move around crouch and click on what you want to interact with. Works very well for the game. Also you dont fight back in the game you either run hide or die. UI - Very clean and basic.Setting - underground most of the game in creepy places like cellers, sewers, tunnels castels, etc...Story: well I played half the game and took a month break from it so I didnt follow the story to well but their is lots of notes in the game that explain what area your in and why things are happening. Very intersting story tho.Scary? - Let me say this: I cried a few times ;_;Fun? Let me say this: I hate wanting to play the game because i know i will♥♥♥♥♥♥myself but love every moment of it. 9/10 for story gameplay and true horror without adding lots of blood and guts.

												An excellent piece of digital-interactive artwork that uses the 4 essesntial elements of gaming (algorithm, player activity, interface, graphics) to spectacular degrees, all in order to deliver the scares and overwhelming creepiness of an experience that makes a game a true survival horror. The claustrophobic blackness of every step you take along with your character's (Daniel's) frequent gasps and whimpers over the incessant hauntings and attacks you endure throughout the campaign build a disarming immersion into a ghastly world all the advertisements and reviews of this game have promised. Although all your struggles charging through the game are inevitibly concluded with any one of the three rather disappointing endings, the sweat and shivers the whole shebang (quite effectively) offers makes it an experience totally worth a sappy resolution to forget about underneath the terrific fog of memories you'll make with the genuinely frightening gameplay and set pieces.

												One of the best horror games of all time, Amnesia packs one of the best atmospheres and renders the player helpless, playing tricks both on what it sees and hears. The story and its progression is also amazingly done so that the player will be between hiding in a corner forever or unraveling the mysteries of this place and its characters.

												Amnesia is a decent puzzle game. I say puzzle because I wasn't horrified by this game. At all. There were also times that I managed to bug out enemies from my sight. If you're used to Japanese Horror and planning to play this game, prepare to be disappointed since you won't really find yourself to be scared. I am thankful that it doesn't reset my progress (like Outlast) and the checkpoints allows me to streamline my progress and continue with the story. I enjoyed the game despite some weird puzzles and recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You don't often get a horror game that is genuinely terrifying without throwing a slew of cheap jump scares at you. But when you do, you get one of the greatest horror games ever created.

												Without a doubt the best horror game I have ever played. The atmosphere the game offers is chilling as you make your way through different rooms and solve puzzles to uncover the creepy story.  This game brings you to a new level letting you interact with items around you and being pursued by enemy's around every corner. The game not only is scary, but the story is great and the game runs great not requiring much from your pc. if you want to be scared to death and you go on a journey to a dark deep place and get your money's worth BUY THIS GAME!!!

Highly RecommendedEven though i did not encounter anything scary during gameplay, i found out that you can pick anything you see in the game world and throw them around (Books, Table, Drawers, Cabinets, Chairs, Barrels, Planks etc..). I Played Outlast before, then i found Amnesia and bought it. Amnesia is Better than OutlastPros Gameplay Ambience Music Sounds Can Move Objects(All Objects) This is Scary!Cons Graphics (Since i have a habit of playing with Lifelike graphics)Final VerdictRating: 8/10 ",85,3,3,6,7,0,7

												If you like horror games, then this game is just for you! Find your way to find the naked old man Alexander as you forget who you are and where you are while wandering around the halls of Brennenburg and shi*ting bricks when that book falls off the shelf. But be careful, you will come across several spooky monsters in the game, like the Grunt with dirty nipples that actually just wants to hug you, and the Brute who likely doesn't have his *cough* painis, and all those naked bodies you just cant stop staring at. Good luck!			",134,16,0,16,10,2,4

												Amnesia the Dark Decent is a puzzle/ horror game made by Frictional games.  In amnsia you must avoid monsters, solve very challenging puzzles and use the environment to your advantage as you try to remember who you are and achieve your goals.Amnesia has a very good story line in that is keeps you scared and interested with it's dark and morbid theme. Through the whole game there are also many back storys viewed in notes and flash backs to explain what happened so long ago.In this game you can only run or hide while in other horror games you can fight this one you can not, you must use your brain, senses and wits to survive. The AI is very well done it will keep you on your toes, as it attempts to hunt you and it’s good at what it does. I have not seen a single glitch in the game yet with the AI.The physics are mostly perfect, you can use the objects around you to make sounds to escape danger and also for barricading or solving complex puzzles.The soundtrack suits the environment and atmoshphere well, it brings out the best in the horrer experience and it really helps to immerse ones self into the game. This can also be usefull as it can signal the approch of an enamy or other things. The sound design is all so fairly accurate to, if you use your ears you can hear where the monsters are and the genral direction to. This also works well with the throwing of objects and contraptions as they sound unique and of good quality.What also makes this good is that it does not rely heavily on jump scares, rather it messes with your mind instead. It makes you imagine there’s an enemy round the corner, behined you or in a room close by. This means that the game uses your own imagination to scare you, as it plays mind games to make you jumpy. Graphics wise it has a unique medevil style to it well detailed with plenty of varied and well thought out locations and enviroments, each haveing it's own theme and style to it as well.One of my grudges is that there is not much variety in monsters, this can mean that monsters can get less scary or get more easy to predict as time goes on, since there is only 3-4. However the monsters that are present work and act very diffrently from each other, haveing unique sounds mechanics and aesthetics to each of them.The puzzles are varied and complex from the basics to finding a hidden item, up to working out how to fix advanced machinery and other things. This also ties in with the ability to maniplulate objects, as mentiond befor you will need to do this to compleat some puzzles.Personally I got scared over and over again I love this game, because it gives you a real sense of fear and no way to fight back unlike other games, like dead space or resident evil where you can shoot the monster and lose the fear factor quickly. SPOLIER ALERTMy last grudge is with the endings in which there are 3 one I find to be satisfiying, the other to  feeling like copy pastes of one another with only slight varation, but this is just my opnion on it. This is just my opinion but Overall amnesia the dark decent is a great game filled with horror suspence and fright, if you love horror then I definitely recommend you play this game and it’s not too pricey ever well worth the buy. I give it an 8.5 out of 10 I would rate it higher but there is a lack of monster types and the endings give this a lower score.			",72,9,0,19,14,0,17

												Amnesia captures the essence of what it is to be terrifying.  You're not a one-man army.  You're not a space marine.  You're not even a guy with just a few hours of martial arts class.  You're just an ordinary person with no memory of who he once was trying to uncover the clues behind his past (yeah I know it sounds cliche, but this is one game that makes it work really well).  You have only one defense: run.  Run as fast as you can and hide.  If it's a scary game you want then look no further.			",252,45,7,10,7,1,23

												I like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and am a fan of the Amnesia series. I have previously played through The Dark Descent and I have got to say its a pretty great horror game. Its not as much jump scares as a sense of impending doom that is always following you. The story is decent as well. Overall I would recommend the Amnesia games if you enjoy horror, mystery and adventure.  There is definately a time to be had in any Amnesia game, mod or spinoff.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												Amnesia captures the essence of what it is to be terrifying.  You're not a one-man army.  You're not a space marine.  You're not even a guy with just a few hours of martial arts class.  You're just an ordinary person with no memory of who he once was trying to uncover the clues behind his past (yeah I know it sounds cliche, but this is one game that makes it work really well).  You have only one defense: run.  Run as fast as you can and hide.  If it's a scary game you want then look no further.			",252,45,7,10,7,1,23

												Amnesia doesn't deserve title ""Scariest game ever made"" for nothing. Game's atmoshphere is so strong, that it keeps player choked till the last minutes. Plot is similar to H. P. Lovecraft's stories and keeps things interesting all the way to the end of the game. All the horror and terror game has to offer kept it's sharpness during my 10h play. Recommended to play in dark with headphones. Just make sure you don't wake up anyone when you happen to yell out loud, that's what happened to me. Good Job Frictional Games!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As someone  that will scream at the most predictable of jump scares I hate horror games. My friends make a point of gifting me horror anything just to constantly remind me they are willing to watch me play for 'support'. And that is exactly how Amnesia The Dark Descent appeared in my library. One lazy Sunday afternoon I felt particularly brave; headset - check, buddy on chat to play through with - check, all lights on and closed doors - check. I was hyperventilating from the very ""no no nooo way go away"" to the last.Highly recommend a change of underwear before, during and after playing.			",86,28,0,6,7,1,1

												Partly Pewdiepie brought me to this game, and I have him besides the developers to thank for a really great horror game! Amnesia is really one of the best horror games out there, especially in terms of creating that terror feeling when you have a hard time staying at the computer while playing.. The game got quite a good story however you can download a bunch of custom stories which gives you even more interesting/horror gameplay. I would almost go as far as to say that this game is a classic game in its genre which is a definitely ""must play"" if you like horror games			",88,26,0,8,8,1,5

												Reviewing horror classics this time.The game, that changed the way, scary games were made... the father of Outlast !What makes this scary?1. The Atmosphere - The atmosphere is very tense. The game takes place in dark old castle, which appears empty (oh it is not :D). Authors made the sounds very frightening and whole game makes you feel like something is following you - you may just get very paranoid.2. The Unknown - Why am i here? Who... or what is after me? WTF WAS THAT SOUND? thats the questions that will be very slowly answered.3. Defenslessness - You just have no way to fight back, your only option is to hide. Enemies are uncommon in this game, which just makes their encounter surprising and scary and relies on your quick reaction.Worth a try, but note, that this game is focused on story. Reading long notes is big part of the game - some takes you to flashback and some will hint you the solution to some puzzles, you will find along the way. There are no weapons, you will not be killing anyone in this game. They, however, may kill you :P.8/10, you will never visit any castles ever again.			",100,16,9,6,4,2,19

												The first thing newcomers need to understand is that this game is NOT the sequel to Blue's Clues as some would suspect. But instead buckle in with your kids for a fun-filled family shooting game in the vein of Wii Sports and Mario Kart. You play as Daniel, a man who is lost in the castle looking for his Princess, Alexander. This game is definitely taking gay rights and marriage equality to new heights by introducing young children to this matter. Unfortunately, your princess is in another castle (or sanctum) and so you have to defeat Bowsers new plucky goons, the Duckfaces, along with the Creakarms in order to find him. There are various fun puzzles you have to complete, such as redirecting water in the sewer to get a silly man to stay quiet and stop disturbing the eco-system. All in all it teaches kids fantastic modern values and is not only ahead of its time in terms of content but also in gameplay.It is the first family game since Freddi Fish to allow users to make their own custom stories. Maybe you need to teach your kids the value of honesty and kindness? Valve is way ahead of you with its custom story Justine, but you can design your own with the knowledge of scripting and programming! Forget robots, Amnesia is the future.I was personally disappointed with the lack of female characters but understandably, Ubisoft is to blame.11/10 game, definitely start with your kids young.

												Amnesia is absolutely nerve racking and terrifying. I will honetly tell you that I am not scared easily, but there were moments of the game that I just had to pause to collect my thoughts. The great thing about it was that it was not these so called ""Jump-Scares"" that made the game scary, and not even the monsters  themselves, but the mind going off-the-walls about what might be behind the next corner. Another frightening aspect was the intence survival, the worry of the lamp going out, the worry of being spotted by the monsterous creature only feet from you, and the fear of losing your mind. The game supplies such an intense array of terror that trying to think about the tasks you are aled with can be a challenge at times, and the simple completion of a seemingly simple puzzle or task can give you an absolute sense of accpoplishmet and self respect. I sat for several minutes telling myself how ingenius I was that I figured out one of the puzzles when I first played it. Steam may say I've only played it for a short time, but I was offline for most of it so it dosn't include my offline time. I was on it for more than 10 hours. I recomend this game to anyone and everyone because I think that this game isn't for a certain type of person, because every person will be rocked and terrifyed equally.			",154,21,4,24,9,0,7

												Why am I writing this up? It's Amnesia. It's the game that everyone points to first when someone asks ""What's a scary game?"" People that have never played it recommend it to people who will buy it and never play it. What am I even doing here?The truth is, I needed a reason to revisit this one. I'm a terribly jumpy person and genuinely scary games can wear me out good. The first time I played Amnesia, I never even made it to a monster. I knew I needed to give it another go and this was the perfect time to do it. And while I was playing, a thought occurred to me. Amnesia's been around for years at this point. How does it hold up in a post-Alien: Isolation world?Amnesia casts you, unsurprisingly, as an amnesiac in a drafty old castle back in the 1800s. You soon find a missive from yourself, assuring you that you didn't want those memories anyway and there's someone in the castle you really ought to kill. As you begin exploring the darkened, crumbling halls, you find that there are other residents of the castle that are none too pleased to see you. There's no fighting in this one, it's pure stealth or fleeing. The cornerstone of Amnesia's gameplay, much like Penumbra before it, is sanity. Looking at monsters, seeing freaky things happening, and being in the dark make you lose sanity. Of course, if you stand there in front of a torch, the things that want to turn your insides into outsides will have an easy time spotting you. Encounters with monsters are all about balancing your stealthy skulking against your dwindling sanity, which is only restored by progressing through the game. It's a finite resource system like food in Lone Survivor, and works to layer urgency on top of your horror. I must admit it's a bit of a bother here though, because it puts some irritating visual effects on you when it gets terribly low.The sanity effects are about the only misstep in the aesthetics, though. The graphics still hold up and manage to be rich and varied while still maintaining the dark, oppressive atmosphere. The level design is simple but effective, sending you through lavish halls and crumbling cellars and stranger places still, pacing out the frights and creatures. The big standout here though is the sound design. There is a lot more going on here than in most games, with your character making all sorts of breathing sounds and whimpers, footsteps for everyone being accurate to the surface that produces them, and even light sources making their own realistic ambient sounds. The castle itself is full of creepy sounds as well, most being apropos of nothing, but that just makes it all the more effective when it DOES signal something.I was very pleased with the pacing of the game, and found it had little to no contrivances to get you where it wanted you to be. Enemy encounters are infrequent enough to keep you on edge when they're not around, and absolutely terrify you when they are. Dealing with them is obviously less involved than in Alien: Isolation but much more free-form than, say, Outlast. I could see some of the terror being lost if you have to repeat certain sections a few times, but the game is balanced well enough with pacing and items that it shouldn't be a concern unless you're really trying to pull back the curtain for yourself.To my surprise, I found myself getting scared more often with this than in Alien. For me, Alien is much more about constant tension and the battle of wits with the xenomorph, whereas Amnesia is more about the terror of being helpless and confused. Not many games have managed to pull off the powerless protagonist angle without it becoming grating, but Amnesia owns it. Simple sounds and sudden visual effects will chill you to the bone, not as cheap jump scares but as payoffs to the incredible atmosphere the game maintains at all times. I feel confident in saying that no matter how far the genre progresses, Amnesia will always have a place of honor among the games that truly terrify.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												I... don't get it. This is supposed to be one of the greatest horror games of all time? Did I go into it with too high expectations? Did playing Frictional's other games first desensitize me?My problems with Amnesia can be easily explained when you look at the second sentence on it's Steam page:""A game about immersion, discovery and living through a nightmare.""Immersion. I had no issues immersing myself in Penumbra's universe. SOMA, despite having a very talkative protagonist, was still a relatable character, and I had no issues seeing myself in his shoes. Amnesia, however, is based around a very gimmicky sanity mechanic. It sounds like a good idea in theory, especially considering the Lovecraftian themes the game is touching on, but in practice it only served to break immersion. How am I supposed to find this world scary, or even take it seriously when the POV character is waaaaay more scared of the wind blowing open a door than I am? Not just scared, cowering in fear. Crawling and spasming on the ground over nothing and I'm just sitting here going... what the ♥♥♥♥, dude?Discovery. SOMA had no lighting issues. Penumbra was very dark at places, but I never ran out of glowsticks or flashlight batteries. Amnesia, on the other hand? Not only is it much worse lit than Penumbra, but light sources are extremely scarce. How am I supposed to know anything about my environment, or discover anything, when I can't see a ♥♥♥♥ing thing? Not only that, but the game discourages you from spending time in the darkness. It increases your insanity. So here I am bumping between walls, trying to find my way out of a room while my character is having a panic attack because he is literally afraid of the dark?Living through a nightmare. I'll give the game that. Playing this thing was a nightmare. Not a fun nightmare either. Not even a scary one. Just an underwhelming and thoroughly boring one.No, I do not reccomend this game. Penumbra: Overture had a few problems but I loved every minute of it, Penumbra: Black Plague is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed masterpiece. Penumbra: Requiem exists. SOMA is very, very good, as I mentioned in my review of it. Amnesia... is an extremely overhyped pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's got nothing on Frictional's other work.			",394,138,3,48,37,2,58

												After waiting a couple of years to actually get my hands on this game, I have to say it was well worth the wait. The whole experience is brilliant. If you're looking for a game that drags you in and doesn't let you go even after you've stopped playing then this is the game for you. From the eerie corridors at the start of the game, to the claustrophobic dungeons as you progress, the atmosphere never eases up and a constant sense of dread follows you throughout the story. The story, the immersion and the gameplay are all great and I'd definitely reccomend this to anyone looking for a good horror game and an immersive experience.			",27,4,0,6,4,0,6

If you are scared easily you will not see the genius that was required to make the atmosphere of Dark Descent because all you will be worried about are the ""Monsters"".

The game isnt just about monsters since they may be real or they could be all in your head, are you really roaming a monster infested mansion?            Or is it all in your head?

												This is such a fantastic game - even though I'm having problems with it, no matter how many times I die to monsters (or end up getting stuck inside a room) I just want to keep playing. In fact, I'm doing a series of highlights videos on my Youtube channel where I'm playing through this pretty much completely blind. I'm not picking up any notes or journals or diaries; I'm not reading anything, and I'm still having a blast with it when I'm wandering around not knowing what to do. I guess that's just another great thing about this game; they managed to make a coherent story using only flashbacks, so that even without reading any of the important stuff I still kind of know why I'm doing what I'm doing. I'm even looking forward to finishing this first playthrough so I can go back on my own and read everything up, pick up all the details I missed and see how much that changes the story.This is the first part of my series if you want to check it out:

												I enjoyed this game immensely, but it did not have a very lasting appeal to me. The original story of this game is very captivating, and it presents 3 different endings. Unfortuantely, those endings can only be chosen in the end of the game. But the mods, and this is what makes me like the game, the mods for this game are so dang amazing. Some are extremely scary. Some are just silly. But overall, this game is fun. If you enjoy scary games, I would recommend this game along with the penumbra series, which was made by the same creators of Amnesia.

												For those who liked the Penumbra games would enjoy this game as well. It's a good game, the horror environment is well set and the puzzles are pretty intricate yet not too hard. The story is very well done even if there are no real answers in the end. Not crazy about being defenseless or the fact that darkness makes you crazy but its enough to live through. Sadly not a very long game but fun nonetheless for 3 bucks. A decent game for those who can enjoy these kinds of games.			",261,45,1,24,6,0,7

												If I were to describe this game in one word, that word would be ""HolyCrapThisGameIsScary!"".Amnesia: The Dark Descent does not rely simply on jump scares, though there are plenty of them, instead it reels you in through it's immersive story, creepy environment, and its ability to mess with the senses. Venturing through the eerie dungeons gives you a sense of wonder and the urge to continue along the course. The game is scary but the storyline keeps pulling you back in, not allowing you to stop playing for more than a few hours.Amnesia: The Dark Descent is special because of the fact that it does not give you great power. You can simply run and hide from any kind of creature that you encounter. You cannot fight back when being attacked, you merely die, and must come up with a way to outsmart your ""opponent"".  This game also affects ""Daniel"" the Character you are playing as. After the game carries on he begins to become insane, making it harder to perform simple tasks and in the process striking fear in your soul!I will say that this game is not like any others before it; in fact it will inspire the Horror Survival Genre forever. This is nearly the pinnacle of Horror games because it gives the gamer a sense of curiosity and does not allow itself to be forgotten very easily in your mind.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the adrenaline rush of being scared and to anyone who loves a great mysterious story.

												Amnesia has a special something that most games fail to acheive. That is what you become aware of almost as soon as you finish the game. The only way I could possibly describe the game once I finished was... Wow... Just wow... The game is probobly the example of what a horror game should be for all the indie creators and AAA developers out there. However, what does this game achieve in?To start off, we must discuss the story. The story is what makes up a game for me as a gamer. Game has bad story, its a bad game. There has only been a handful of games that go against this, but even still, those handful don't match the rest. However, Amnesia's story is phenomenal and a lot darker then you anticipate. When I entered, I thought this game was going to have a very gothic story (which it did) but did not see the grisly scenes of torture coming up on the plot. Even if this is all told in flashbacks and distrubing hallucinations, it does not take away from the fact the story is messed up. YOU WILL REGRET TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT YOU FORGOT. Daniel says to himself in the very beginning ""I choose to forget"" and you'll see why sure enough. To put it simply, do not doubt for a moment this game's story will get to you.Onto Gameplay, it's a straight through adventure with puzzles and terror thrown in the mix. The game is actually pretty open believe it or not, not Minecraft kind of open but a open where some of the rooms have little purpose but to be there. (Which is what I believe Amnesia: Machine for Pigs I lacking, but that's not the point). The castle is a fun place to explore and the puzzles why can have little things you might miss, truly are not frustrating. If you want a frustrating horror puzzle game, go to Anna:Extended Edition. While that was not a bad game at all, the puzzles get very annoying. Amnesia however masters the right balance of puzzles and terror and really make a good game out of it. Part of the gameplay as well, is as you might expect hiding, running, and screaming. I did not die much during the game, which is a good thing, but the moments I ran and hid sent chills rushing through my spine and got the adreniline pumping. However, I'll discuss that in scarinessThe game is scary, every moment is scary, this game is the scariest game out there. You will not know what to expect, and some of the areas will truly scare you. I got scared several times and panicked at little and big things, the game's atmopshere really prepares you for this game. If you don't believe me, do the ""immersion"" the game discusses at the beginning and do just that. You will surely have a heart attack... (I suggest calling 911 before playing the game, so in the eight minutes that it takes for them to arrive, you'll have to wait little)The last thing I need to discuss is the Audio and Graphics. The graphics look great, I have to say, maybe not what everyone else seems to find ""great"" these days but they are good. There were only two moments where I got a buggy graphic or thought ""They could have made this better"" but truly its good. The game was also made in 2010 when we still were just starting to improve graphics, so I have no complaints. The Audio however is what is really important to discuss, the Audio is what makes the game scary. The whole game I played with headphones, though it made me cower in fear and suffer serious mental issues, I don't regret a thing. There is a certain thing that the game does with it's audio, that just makes it so good. You don't even need a screen for some of the audio to send shivers down your spine. It sticks with you far after the game is done and when you hear that Grunt or Brute's cry of anger you will fear for your life.Overall, the game is excellent. Do not miss out on this game. It is one of the best game I have ever played in my life and sure as heck the best horror game.Story 9/10Gameplay 9/10Scariness 10/10Graphic & Audio 9/10Overall: 9/10			",134,61,0,12,11,1,5

												Amnesia is easily the scariest game I've ever played, and I'm a big fan of horror games. Games like Resident Evil are a lot of fun, but barely manage to scare me. Also, what's up with Slender being like the standard for a good horror game. Slender is scary once, the first time you see Slenderman. After that you're just wandering through the woods while the same guy chases you. It's good for a free horror game, yet some people think it's the scariest game ever, but it doesn't come close to Amnesia. Anyway, Amnesia scares you in so many ways. Not only are the enemies chasing you incredibly disturbing, there are lots of kind of less obvious, but incredibly scary, moments. Once I went into a room, saw a cage with a dead body in it hanging from the ceiling, and later when I returned to the room it was gone... The story is also very creepy if you pay attention to the notes you find. If you don't use an online guide, like me, the game will take you somewhere from 8-10 hours, but if you do use a guide then it shouldn't take longer than 5 or so. I actually liked their previous games, The Penumbra series, better than Amnesia in terms of gameplay, but Amnesia is much scarier.			",246,77,7,23,17,2,40

												I can't even begin to describe how this game makes me feel. I love all things horror and none of it has ever scared me but this game is something else. While watching a horror movie you get to see terrible things happen to people. In Amensia it is all happening to you. There are moments when I had to take my headphones off, turn the lights on, and step away from my computer for a little bit. The is the ultimate horror experience. If you love horror you must buy this game.At the beginning of the game it tells you to play with headphones and the lights off. Do yourself a favor and do it. It enhances the experience so much.Don't read any spoilers. Don't read any guides. Don't watch any videos of gameplay. Just play the game and you will see what the fuss is all about.11/10			",167,12,3,14,12,0,12

												Amnesia is probably one of my favourite games of all time and cetainly my favourite horror title of all time. The game itself plays very well and provides a very good atmosphere and mood. The enemies are always dangerous and always pose a threat to the player since you only have the capacity to outrun them over short distances and long distances will result in you being caught and likely killed. The games scare factor varies based on the player I myself didn't find it scary however it was tense and immersive and I enjoyed the experiece a lot.The games visuals are rather dated however, the lighting could use some touching up and some of the textures look as if they are from a very old game. However this didn't seem to ruin the immersion for me as its possible to interact with almost every object within the game world such a levers, candles, torches, barrels, crates and books to name a few, even those objects that aren't relevant are able to be interected with. This adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay as it gets the player thinking about what is needed to complete certain sections and puzzles within the game. I was also quite impressed with the storyline and the way it was told as the notes system and being able to read into it by picking them up throughout the game allows for various interpretations of the story and also allows players to connect with it at their own pace. The average amount of play time it takes to complete the game I feel is also worth it for the price as it is a very enjoyable time and can potentially be played through again dependent on the players view of the game. This game also incorporates a few good mechanics such as the depleting lantern oil and insanity. This adds to the difficultly and fits in with it being in the survival horror genre. It could also signficantly alter the way some players move through the game.Overall: Fantastic, 90/100			",94,10,1,9,7,0,9

Some horror games (i.e. Five Nights at Freddy's and Resident Evil) I can play because I've learned how to handle the jumpscares and the horror aspects....That's not the case here...The atmosphere and the ambient noises are what really set the ""horror"" mood for this game. Hearing footsteps from above is spine-chilling and the sound of your own heart racing brings the horror to life. The sudden noises will stop you dead in your tracks. Every room is another suprise and shock waiting to appear.Multiple times I've stopped playing because I'm terrified of what's in the next room.This game can burn out your fear meter until you just stare blankly at your screen, feeling nothing but fear and emptiness.7.8/10Pros- Smooth gameplay- Good story to follow- Always has the player on edge- For the ones looking for a rush of fear and adrenalineCons- Terrifying as Hell- Too much water- Did I mention it's terrifying?- The rush of fear and adrenaline is 2much4me ",39,5,2,3,3,0,1

												Finalmente completato, cosa dire ora? Parlerà per me H.P. Lovercraft:""Non sapevo, né mi premeva saperlo, se l’avventura che stavo vivendo fosse un sogno, magia, oppure frutto della follia. Non aveva importanza alcuna per me, che ero più che mai deciso a contemplare ad ogni costo lo splendore e la gioia. Non sapevo chi fossi, né che cosa fossi, e neppure a quale mondo appartenessi; tuttavia, mentre avanzavo solitario incespicando ad ogni passo, nacque in me la coscienza di una sorta di spaventosa memoria latente che rendeva il mio procedere non del tutto casuale.""

												I think Amnesia : The Dark Descent is one of the scariest games ever made.We can understand that because the game was made by an independent developer. I really loved Amnesia because all the games that qualify themselves has ""Horror-Survival"" are not scary at all, I think about Left 4 Dead (even if I love this game too), when you see a zombie, you kill him with a shotgun and that's all. In Amnesia, you run and hide, the only answer to the encounter between you and a monster is to escape. The fear is omnipresent, when you hear screaming voices, when you open a door, when you go into the darkness of a room without light, your heart is going crazy. This is one of the game I will remember all my life as a game of quality.The game worths more than it's original price. However, I bought it and I didn't finish a level, yet.9/10			",185,29,8,13,9,2,37

												There isn't much to say about Amnesia: The Dark Descent that hasn't been said already. It's a very effective survival horror experience just teeming with atmosphere. The lack of a combat system will have you inching forward afraid for your life while the sanity system will push you to avoid staying in the darkness for too long. It's refreshing that this game doesn't rely so much on jump scares than on constant dread to get the scares out of the player. A definite wholehearted recommendation.			",285,124,4,44,27,4,28

												I will be the first to say that some of the scares in this game are cheap and the programing is pretty predictable at times. Even when you know that sound you heard in one room is nothing, but that corner that is silent is most likely more dangerous, you still get a bit nervous. Honestly, this is probably one of the best and scariest horror games out there. Most people love this game, and it is easy to see why. You will spend most of the gameplay solving puzzles, and half way through the game you will find yourself hiding from monsters a lot. Even so, there are a few curve balls thrown into the game to make it feel fresh. One of my favorite disturbing moments in the game was when I had to try to get away from an invisible water creature by throwing remains acrossed the room hoping that it would go after that instead of me. This game is disturbing, frightening, and chilling, with a great story to boot. Fans of the horror genre will love this game.			",137,29,0,19,5,0,11

Although it is not that new of a game, it is a MUST if you haven't played it and have an urge to play some horror.  For any variety of horror game fans, this has something in it for everyone.  It isn't one of those games that has cheap jump scares every five seconds and is one of the more genuine horror game titles that I had a great experience playing.

The enemies in this game never cease to make me panic when they're chasing me, especially that water monster. That one scares me the most.I also thought there could have been more voice acting from whoever voiced Daniel when having a conversation with someone. But it is how it is, and doesn't really change how I feel about the game whatsoever.So I can honestly say that this is definitely one of my most favorite horror games ever.			",78,19,0,3,5,0,0

If you are able to suspend your disbelief the game will take you to dark world full of ghouls and poltergeists.  The puzzles are rudimentary so don’t be expecting a tomb raider type puzzle system, but the ambience makes up for what the game lacks in challenge.			",471,84,8,44,47,3,64

Playing it for the first time without knowing what this game is about? I guarantee you that you may pause the game in fright the whole time your playing saying, ""F@#$ it, I'm done."" This game also has a selection of custom stories you can play after the main story. So the fun doesn't end after you thought you defeated your greatest fears.

												This was one of the most intense horror games I have ever played through.  Rarely does a game make me jump, but this managed to do it many times.  The atmosphere is chilling, to the point where you are afraid to even move to the next area, lest you come across a beast that will tear you to pieces in seconds.  The use of darkness causing your character's insanity to warp the reality you are perceiving was a great idea.  The light is your only friend here.

												When my friend told me that Amnesia: The Dark Descent was free untill Wednesday September 16 I just had to get it. So I waited for the download to finish (which is not that long btw) and checked my friend's profile, and i had seen he was playing Amnesia recently, so my eyes wandered over the play time... it was 0.3 hr (18 min).10/10 would sh*t my pants agian			",41,3,0,5,2,0,1

												It will probably scare the heart out of your body, thrilling and interesting story.  Really good graphics and dynamics.  The concept is spectacular and the AI itself is splendid.  Sometimes it stutters (maybe it's on my case) for a while, like 2 - 5 min, then it goes back o normal. But it really isn't a complain the game is still playable.  Recommended if you surely want to get scared when you are alone and at night. 8.5/10			",42,3,7,6,3,1,1

The story line is really interesting and the execution near perfect. Controls, puzzles, everything is smooth. No issues with nvidia surround and FOV was good, plus SLI works like a charm. Highly recommend this one.			",103,18,9,3,3,0,1

												amnesia is truely nothing more then a awesome puzzle/horror game where you need to find your way out of the hell and go after some guy who cause all this. and besides that this game makes it scary with noises - music - monster and unexpected moments. and the most impresive is some hallways and places there that looks so extreemly beautiful even in low graphics.also the story is pretty interresting and it's really good and builded well. and here you have a link from one of my playtrough in this game about how I experience it and it also doesn't have any spoilers about the story.but my conclusion is: this game is totally worth it to buy it! and don't forget to check out my playtrough/gameplay video about it.

												Truly a worthy successor to the Penumbra Series and vastly more scary, Dark Descent is DAMN good.ScaresThis game is scary as all hell if you follow the directions (play at night or in the darkest room available, use headphone with good volume level, allow no distractions). From start the finish you feel your own insanity meter spiraling out of control as you immerse yourself into the atmosphere.. This game will have you begging for a brightly-lit room in which to collect your sanity before pressing on.PuzzlesThere are a solid amount of puzzles that are typically never obvious (A Machine for Pigs, I'm looking at you). There are also many items to collect and use throughout the game (A Machine for Pigs, I'm looking at you again). They also act as a contrast to the scary sections of the game, allowing yourself to take a break from being insane.Plot / StoryThe story takes a back-seat to nothing and aligns with what I would expect coming from the Penumbra series. If you are interested, the game provides a wealth of back-stories and side-stories to explore.Other Stuff- Game's good- You should buy it and play it- If you like it you should go buy the Penumbra series - 3 games for cheap!

												This game is ultra scary. But nevertheless, it's super fun. The game scares you so badly because it almost never gives you a break. There is always a creepy noise, grusome scenery (sometimes more than others), monster chasing you, and the music just creeps you out. Also, it keeps building up suspence, more and more, until you are about to burst, then finally, a monster shows up out of no where and scares you to death. I love it, but it's not for those who are easily scared, they will have nightmares for weeks.			",57,3,0,5,3,0,0

												I found out about this game through a review in PC Gamer magazine. I'll be the first to admit that I was skeptical about the mechanics (no weapons? what!?) but they are the key to the terror of this game. In any other scary game, you can just whip out a plasma cannon to destroy the things that scare you. In this game, all you can do is cower in fear and hide. This key mechanic, whereby you are rewarded for hiding raises the fear levels unlike anything I have ever played. When you round a corner in some dank, dark castle sub-floor and hear an inhuman growl, I guarantee you will soil your pants. The game itself oozes atmosphere, and it even encourages you to play in the dark with headphones on. This game is absolute ART that will TERRIFY you. I tell people all the time, ""Amnesia makes Dead Space feel like a walk through a sunny, butterfly-filled meadow."" There were literally moments where I had to step away from it to gather myself, it is THAT SCARY. Do yourself a favor and GET THIS GAME!			",217,12,6,5,13,1,8

												For those who liked the Penumbra games would enjoy this game as well. It's a good game, the horror environment is well set and the puzzles are pretty intricate yet not too hard. The story is very well done even if there are no real answers in the end. Not crazy about being defenseless or the fact that darkness makes you crazy but its enough to live through. Sadly not a very long game but fun nonetheless for 3 bucks. A decent game for those who can enjoy these kinds of games.			",261,45,1,24,6,0,7

												Rejuvenating survival horror. Perfect, endlessly unsettling sound design. Horrifying environments. Pure chilling Lovecraftian narrative told and unearthed in a consistently engaging manner. Puzzles that are simple enough to not become frustrating and challenging enough to not feel like pointless busywork. An unshakeable feeling of being chased and even in the dingiest corners being constantly out in the open and exposed to danger. Hiding from monsters that more often than not aren't there, abusing every inch of your imagination, and when they are there delivering terrifying sequences of frantic escape slamming doors behind you and terrified hiding cowering into walls desperately trying not to be seen, having to balance attempts at avoiding them with your dwindling sanity in the dark. Leaping from box to box in a flooded room avoiding the invisible creature that waits in the water, and the panicked rush to safety when you inevitably slip and hear the splashing rapidly approaching behind you. Lighting, sanity and ""flight not fight"" mechanics that have impacted so much in the five years since its release, making it hard to imagine the horror landscape of the 2010s without it. The defining horror game of the decade so far.			",175,50,0,13,5,1,16

												I think Amnesia : The Dark Descent is one of the scariest games ever made.We can understand that because the game was made by an independent developer. I really loved Amnesia because all the games that qualify themselves has ""Horror-Survival"" are not scary at all, I think about Left 4 Dead (even if I love this game too), when you see a zombie, you kill him with a shotgun and that's all. In Amnesia, you run and hide, the only answer to the encounter between you and a monster is to escape. The fear is omnipresent, when you hear screaming voices, when you open a door, when you go into the darkness of a room without light, your heart is going crazy. This is one of the game I will remember all my life as a game of quality.The game worths more than it's original price. However, I bought it and I didn't finish a level, yet.9/10			",185,29,8,13,9,2,37

												I didn't know you could create a game these days without being able to hit people. This is an absolutely stunning game which uses detective work to figure out what to do. Playing this will scare you (I reccomend playing in a dark room at night to get the full scare factor) but it takes intelligence to complete the tasks. Some had me stumped for ages, so it felt all the better when I figured them out. Not for people who hate being scared and very well written.

												This game is ultra scary. But nevertheless, it's super fun. The game scares you so badly because it almost never gives you a break. There is always a creepy noise, grusome scenery (sometimes more than others), monster chasing you, and the music just creeps you out. Also, it keeps building up suspence, more and more, until you are about to burst, then finally, a monster shows up out of no where and scares you to death. I love it, but it's not for those who are easily scared, they will have nightmares for weeks.			",57,3,0,5,3,0,0

												There isn't much to say about Amnesia: The Dark Descent that hasn't been said already. It's a very effective survival horror experience just teeming with atmosphere. The lack of a combat system will have you inching forward afraid for your life while the sanity system will push you to avoid staying in the darkness for too long. It's refreshing that this game doesn't rely so much on jump scares than on constant dread to get the scares out of the player. A definite wholehearted recommendation.			",285,124,4,44,27,4,28

												This game is seriously the best horror adventure game I've played. You run through halls with nothing but a lantern, and few tools needed to proceed with your adventure. Monsters appear and chase you, and your only defense is to run and hide like the baby you are! This puts out the thrills, suspense, and the great story each horror game should have. The ambience is terrifying as you progress through each part. Puzzles at every corner to tease your mind. I highly suggest getting this if you're in the mood for a good spook and want something to figure out.			",115,1,4,11,5,0,4

												What can be said about Amnesia that hasn't already been said? Rather than attempt to quantify what makes Amnesia one of the most popular horror games to date, I'll just say that if you're looking for scares that are actually scary, look no further.Amnesia is a horror game with inventory puzzles and an odd little sanity mechanic I like to call ""hide and go soil yourself"". While my experience with other horror games has been limited, I can say without a doubt that Amnesia may provide one of the most visceral experiences you have ever gone through in a video game.Amnesia is an absolute joy to play with your friends. If you can manage the time, play through it once on your own, then invite your friends to play it and watch them experience it for the first time. Amnesia is the only game that I have found able to inspire such a feeling of well-meaning spite towards your friends. The kind of spite where you want them to go through the same horrors you did just to see who has better bladder control.When you're done with Amnesia, and you've plumbed the depths of any of the interesting custom levels made by the community, the previous, though unrelated story-wise, Penumbra series by the same developers can wring out a few more decent scares. Just make sure your heart can take it before purchasing.			",109,22,1,5,3,4,5

												I would recommend this game for those who like horror games, but can't fight. As in you have to use your intelligence and quick thinking to beat the game. Mainly from running away from the enemies in the game. The game is weird, yet I enjoyed it. I don't have any issues with this game or any disappointments either.Story: The game is about a guy named Daniel, who has suffered from Amnesia and doesn't remember who he is or where he is. As you explore the mansion or castle, you discover weird secrets(notes) left behind by yourself. You encounter weird enemies and things throughout the game as you try to find your way out(I believe).			",80,15,0,23,10,0,5

												4 years later, and this is still the scariest game I've ever played. If you truely enjoy scaring the crap out of yourself, and cry in fear and laughter. This is truely the game for you. I would also recommend playing at night in the dark for fuller effect. Also makes a better experience if you have friends/family in the room so they can laugh at you, (Or turn the tables and make them play the game and laugh at their missery.) Or be brave and play it by yourself, however I'd recommend having a webcam and screen capture to record your reactions, as you reflect and laugh at yourself if playing solo.The grunts and brutes are terrifying, the sound effects and especially the music help build an 'unsetteling' effect on you. And the mechanics to open doors and draws are down right perfect. The Insane effect is very unforgiving which will require you to stay in lit areas, leaving the chance for a grunt to approach you.After the game is finished I'd highly recommend playing the Justine add-on and the many custom stories created by the community. Many of them will have you re-living the Amnesia experience.Amnesia the Dark Decent gets a 10/10 in my vote. And is, hands down, the most horrifying experience I've ever lived.

												Amnesia ist ein ganz besonderes Spiel. Bei Amnesia erkundet man aus der Ego-Sicht eine Welt im Traum des Protagonisten, eine riesige Burg mit vielen dunklen und gruseligen Geheimnissen. Das Spielprinzip basiert darauf, dass man unter Druck zum Überleben animiert wird, flüchtet, sich versteckt und versucht den schrecklichen Gestalten zu entgehen, die die verlassen Mauern und Gänge der Burg unsicher machen. Man hat einfach Angst! Dabei findet man keinerlei Waffen oder Gegenstände, mit welchen man sich wehren könnte. Ein völlig neues Spielgefühl entsteht, wenn man panisch vor einem Monster wegläuft, Türen hintersich verschließt, durch welche man ebenfalls verfolgt wird, nur um weiter im Stress das Weite zu suchen und dem Geheimnis dieser Traumwelt auf die Spur zu kommen. Ich hatte selten solche Angst in einem Spiel, wie in Amnesia! TOP!			",76,14,1,7,13,0,23

												There aren't many horror games that and truly make you feel hesitant to play them not because they're bad games but because they truly keep you on edge. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of those games, and yes, I admit that I completely broke down at one point for fear that a monster would show up and slice up my back.Unfortunately, if you think about it for a while, the monsters become quite predictable and easy to avoid. When this happens, the horror element is lost, but it won't be until about 3/5 through the game before this happens. Still, the game itself and the occasional wonderful custom stories for it make it a worthy purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why is Amnesia so fantastic? It breaches the mindless, scripted scares that encompass other modern horror games today through a unique approach. This game throws you into a dark world where you remember nothing about where you are or why you are there, except that there is an unknown shadow chasing you as you try to decipher your purpose. Sitting in the dark causes you to hallucinate and slowly lose your mind, and you can die simply from looking at a monster for too long. The fear of the unknown, immersive ambience, and tense motifs are what scare the hell out of anyone attempting to play this game.			",214,19,1,22,6,2,25

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent (also known as Amnesia Ops) is the seventh main installment of the Call of Duty series and was developed by Frictional Games. The game was released on September 8, 2010.What's that? You say this is a horror game and not call of duty?Oh. OH SHI- *dead*Amnesia is a horror-game. A game where you play as a tiny man who cannot fight (and often see) his enemies, and therefore has to run all the time. You are also afraid of the dark and go insane if you stand in it for a while.Because of this it is often said that the main character is the scout from TF2.This game is rated not-for-baby-men and may invoke nightmares, peed pants, cold sweat, the losing control of bowels, frantically shouting and punching in fear, fear-quitting, and heart attacks. It may also consume your children and♥♥♥♥♥♥your wife. But that only happend like, 3562 times.This game is also rated OSWALD. That means it's scary.Good horror game. Buy if you like actual horror.

												Back when I first got this game I wouldn't really commit myself to it, for I thought it was indeed too scary for me and it drained me a lot. Then a month after that I decided I would try to beat it.. no guides, no cheats of course.  Well, it's a great experience. I particularly loved the voice acting, which is superb. Furthermore the music is excellent. There are moments when it makes you feel at ease and peaceful for just a few minutes before making you want to crouch under the desk and sob a bit. Even though it was rather shorter than I expected you definitely have to play it if you love horror. Lights off and a headset should be mandatory though. You will want to immerse in the story and the atmosphere as much a possible. Get it? YES.8/10			",98,10,4,19,5,2,11

												This game is very scary and very fun. I only say it as ""very scary"" because instead of using cheap jumpscares that can scare anyone who isn't expecting it. It actually immerses you into the environment and effectively creeps you out with the harmless events happening in the game. It bumps everything up even more because you can't fight your foe instead you must sneak around or stay stationary in the darkness as you watch a horribly disfigured enemy shuffle across your field of view...

												If you want to be scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this is the game. The ambiance and mood can be frightening, even when there is no immenent danger. Play in the dark, with headphones, alone. You will see. The main story line had medium replay value, but many many MANY custom stories are available which can be just as scary, or scarier. Endless fun and scares to be had here. If you want it to be less hardcore, you can join a skype call with your friends, share your screen, and let them help you out and enjoy your screams. Having a friendly voice in the background lessens the fear factor. Overall, I give this game an A++ for pulling the purpose off well, having little to no glitches, and having ( nearly ) endless free custom stories.			",163,69,3,32,19,0,21

												This was one of the most intense horror games I have ever played through.  Rarely does a game make me jump, but this managed to do it many times.  The atmosphere is chilling, to the point where you are afraid to even move to the next area, lest you come across a beast that will tear you to pieces in seconds.  The use of darkness causing your character's insanity to warp the reality you are perceiving was a great idea.  The light is your only friend here.  It is a short but thrilling ride, but I feel the price reflects that.  If you're a fan of horror/survival games, I can't recommend this one enough.			",277,41,3,49,29,2,67

												Disturbing, engrossing, and challenging, The Dark Descent is both a harrowing horror experience and a decently well realized narrative with careful attention paid to nailing the pacing subtleties.Gameplay is simple and has quality stealth mechanics and sound cues. The adventure game-y puzzles and a plethora of crafting tasks can get a little tiresome by the final strech, but I never lost the investment to beat the game. The experience begins itself perfectly, calling the player to persevere and conquer the ever consuming darkness and NOT be afraid (although you will be).Play it with the lights off and headphones. It's a great ride.			",55,10,0,5,1,0,0

												Rejuvenating survival horror. Perfect, endlessly unsettling sound design. Horrifying environments. Pure chilling Lovecraftian narrative told and unearthed in a consistently engaging manner. Puzzles that are simple enough to not become frustrating and challenging enough to not feel like pointless busywork. An unshakeable feeling of being chased and even in the dingiest corners being constantly out in the open and exposed to danger. Hiding from monsters that more often than not aren't there, abusing every inch of your imagination, and when they are there delivering terrifying sequences of frantic escape slamming doors behind you and terrified hiding cowering into walls desperately trying not to be seen, having to balance attempts at avoiding them with your dwindling sanity in the dark. Leaping from box to box in a flooded room avoiding the invisible creature that waits in the water, and the panicked rush to safety when you inevitably slip and hear the splashing rapidly approaching behind you. Lighting, sanity and ""flight not fight"" mechanics that have impacted so much in the five years since its release, making it hard to imagine the horror landscape of the 2010s without it. The defining horror game of the decade so far.			",175,50,0,13,5,1,16

												Everything that needs be said about this game has already been said. It is a fantastically frightening experience for those that get immersed in horror games and even after countless imitators, it still stands out as the best example of its particular style. Cracks may begin to show in the mechanics if you play it like a regular game, and it requires a certain commitment of mind and focus to have the intended effect, but for those into this kind of thing, it will always be one of the scariest games ever made.

												Horror fans take note! This is the scariest game to come out in quite a while. Walking down those dark corridors can be quite unnerving. Your only ""weapon"" is your trusty lamp that can stave off insanity, but will alert monsters to your location. Sometimes when your character goes insane, he'll halucinate bugs crawling on his face. That was a nice touch. There's also a part where you have to throw dismembered body parts into the water to distract the water monsters long enough to make a run for it. The next time I came across water I was more than a little aprehensive to walk through it. It took me 13 hours to beat. The puzzles arn't super hard. I admit I did have to cheat to find out how to get the elevator working. After running blindly through labrynth-like hallways escaping monsters, the puzzles can be a nice relief. For the full horror experience you'll definitely want to play this one alone in the dark with good head phones. It's $20 (or cheaper) and well worth the cost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game. This game is genius. There is no other way to describe it. Amnesia excels beyond any other game at making you feel completely helpless. Monsters? Yes. But weapons? A big fat NO. The only way you stay alive is by evading and hiding from monsters. And really, the scariness of Amnesia is not the monsters, but the lack thereof. It's the moments when you're walking through a completely silent hallway and your lantern oil runs out that are the scariest. I don't have any other words besides genius to describe this amazing work. Buy this game. You will be scared out of your wits at times, but when you finish the game as I did, you will realize its sheer genius.Well done, Frictional Games! A big salute goes out to you for this work of art!			",51,13,0,4,1,0,1

												I will be the first to say that some of the scares in this game are cheap and the programing is pretty predictable at times. Even when you know that sound you heard in one room is nothing, but that corner that is silent is most likely more dangerous, you still get a bit nervous. Honestly, this is probably one of the best and scariest horror games out there. Most people love this game, and it is easy to see why. You will spend most of the gameplay solving puzzles, and half way through the game you will find yourself hiding from monsters a lot. Even so, there are a few curve balls thrown into the game to make it feel fresh. One of my favorite disturbing moments in the game was when I had to try to get away from an invisible water creature by throwing remains acrossed the room hoping that it would go after that instead of me. This game is disturbing, frightening, and chilling, with a great story to boot. Fans of the horror genre will love this game.			",137,29,0,19,5,0,11

The thing that scared me the most was the thought of me being scared the first time I played all those years ago.That said, it can still be enjoyable and worth the money, if you are into psychological horror games. Just make sure to play it alone, at 3 a.m., in a thunderstorm and you'll be good to go.			",87,6,3,11,19,0,27

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a revivification of the atmospheric horror game. Unable to fight the abominations that stalk you, Amnesia leaves you alone in a gritty atmospheric, slowly turning horrific, setting that pushes you toward finding the answers to your ailment, Amnesia. The game focuses on a few game-play mechanics such as health, mental health (though I believe is called insanity in the game), and finding what are essentially keys for the next zone (though are often items and puzzles) while for the most part being actively stalked by monsters. Some of the most notable elements of the game-play are the mental health meter and its gripping pacing. The mental health in the game involves your ability to stay in the light and avoid gazing at monsters for too long. The second being probably the most important feature. Once the unknown becomes the known it becomes a lot less frightful, so having a game-play mechanic that punishes the unknown becoming known it incredibly smart and well done and it is sufficient enough to last almost the entire game (the later areas somewhat abandon this concept, and it becomes a lot less scary for doing so). Until the end of the game it does a good job of pacing areas of horror and peace, though unannounced to the player, and never once did I feel cheated by the monsters. Overall I would suggest Amnesia to anyone who is looking for a dark, gripping, and atmospheric horror game that will last you a couple of days (approximately 8 hours of content).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The atmospheric horror in this game is absolutely amazing. Scariest game I've ever played? Probably not, but it comes close. Towards the end of the game when you start to get used to what is going on, it losses a lot of its creep factor, but it can still keep you on edge. Definatly worth the buy,  and a playthrough.

Playing it for the first time without knowing what this game is about? I guarantee you that you may pause the game in fright the whole time your playing saying, ""F@#$ it, I'm done."" This game also has a selection of custom stories you can play after the main story. So the fun doesn't end after you thought you defeated your greatest fears.

												A sweet, super short and absolutely spoiler-free review and opinion on the game Amnesia: The Dark Descent by Frictional Games.Close your door, shut down the lights and let the darkness sink in... The only visible light source being the computer monitor. The most rewarding experience will only be achievable in total darkness. Amnesia: The Dark Descent will take care of the rest.As a horror game this gets a lot of things right with just only a handful of annoyances mixed in. The game is definitely recommendable to anyone who is able to handle a lot of spooks and many more jump scares.The game goes even as far as planting some philosophical and truly thought provoking concepts in players head. So after one has beaten the game the memories about the “descending” aren’t necessarily the scary bits and pieces but the moments when the thoughts about “right” and “wrong” start to have debates in players mind. That’s perhaps the most rewarding aspect of the whole packet.My IGN-score: 8.5 / 10***SPOILERS (for those who really want to have a ‘clean’ experience)***Pros:- enjoyable surroundings- atmosphere- the dance of light and darkness (to put it nicely ^_^)Cons:- low resolution textures (the game is nearly seven years old so hardly surprising)- not enough notes, diaries etc to read (completely subjective viewpoint)- less appealing in the end (ok, this one is kinda a stretch {as I said there isn't much to criticise})			",30,4,0,0,1,0,0

												Epic great ambiance, nice puzzles, nice physics (although a bit unnecessary and clunky sometimes), and the enemies... well, they are there to kill you once, then they don't spawn again there and you can continue the history, so it's like they are there just as a annoyance rather than a challenge. As I didn't felt any of them a challenge, I used a guide to remove them from the game so I could experience the ambiance and the level design. Great game, loved to wander the whole castle, loved the puzzles, and the story is quite good too.Recommended for those who are looking for a not much demanding/scary/hard survival horror game.

												A pretty good where the ♥♥♥♥ do i go/what the ♥♥♥♥ do i do kind of game. The game really succeds at scaring you once in a while. It has some good puzzles, it makes you search alot sometimes.do NOT expect a shooter out of this. You have NO ATTACKS in this game.Only downside of this game is that it's short. It also has a twisted story that's slightly hard to understandOverall: 7.5/10			",276,32,5,22,21,2,23

												One of the scariest, if not the scariest horror game on the market. Amnesia is similar to Penumbra in terms of puzzles, clever problem solving and a setting of helplessness in the face of your enemies. Caught within a Prussian medieval castle in the 1800's, you are immediately caught in the middle of the story, but due to amnesia (title drop) you have no recollection of past events, with nothing but a note to yourself and a feeling of being hunted on your mind. Amnesia: The Dark Descent, like Penumbra integrates very interactive physics that not only aid in the adrenaline rush of being chased by a gatherer with a slow-closing door but also said physics are key for the many puzzles of Brennenburg. After playing Penumbra though it's hard to deny that they're both the same type of game but in vastly different settings. In terms of horror, though, Amnesia takes the (blood-soaked) cake.

												If I were to describe this game in one word, that word would be ""HolyCrapThisGameIsScary!"".Amnesia: The Dark Descent does not rely simply on jump scares, though there are plenty of them, instead it reels you in through it's immersive story, creepy environment, and its ability to mess with the senses. Venturing through the eerie dungeons gives you a sense of wonder and the urge to continue along the course. The game is scary but the storyline keeps pulling you back in, not allowing you to stop playing for more than a few hours.Amnesia: The Dark Descent is special because of the fact that it does not give you great power. You can simply run and hide from any kind of creature that you encounter. You cannot fight back when being attacked, you merely die, and must come up with a way to outsmart your ""opponent"".  This game also affects ""Daniel"" the Character you are playing as. After the game carries on he begins to become insane, making it harder to perform simple tasks and in the process striking fear in your soul!I will say that this game is not like any others before it; in fact it will inspire the Horror Survival Genre forever. This is nearly the pinnacle of Horror games because it gives the gamer a sense of curiosity and does not allow itself to be forgotten very easily in your mind.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the adrenaline rush of being scared and to anyone who loves a great mysterious story.

												A fascinating little game.  At its absolute best, it delivers an exceedingly unsettling experience; at some point, you'll almost certainly find yourself cowering in a dark corner hoping desperately that something doesn't kill you and balancing the warm comfort of a candle against the risk something will come around the corner and rip your face off.  At its worst, it's a slow puzzler with sometimes-illogical requirements.Still, as a short, play-it-in-two-solid-sittings game, it's hard to top the  feel it delivers.  Well worth the 6-8 hours it'll take to finish.			",143,41,0,22,4,0,4

												Amnesia is unlike other horror games. The horror in Amnesia The Dark Descent isn't just jumpscares, it is true horror making you on edge and scared the entire time you play giving you nightmares. The graphics and atmosphere in Amnesia is just perfect, and the music just puts you more on edge. not to mention the monsters with their torn faces, only adds excitement to this game. Recommended to play in the dark, with headphones, alone.                                                               10/10 Would buy again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty good game! It's very atmospheric and I love how the history of the character gets revealed little by little, which is kinda expected every time a game/movie/book has amnesia in it. Although this is a horror game, it's not filled with jumpscares. I remember maybe 2 throughout the entire game. The rest of the horror comes from the soundtrack, the ambience, and the layout of the castle (those loooong hallways or all of the corners are great to add suspense). The puzzles are pretty fun. None of them are difficult, which is a bit disappointing, but it also makes it so that you won't get stuck for very long any any one spot.I highly recommend this game, and I'm not usually a fan of horror.

												Amnesia is one of the first games I played after joining Steam (thank you to the friend who urged me to play) and it drew me into the horror game genre. But Amnesia is still the favorite. The beginning may feel a bit slow to some, but trust me, keep going. This game got my heart beating faster and had me on the edge of my seat often. Turning corners and opening doors become terrifying things. And I'm not scared that easily. This game was a lot of fun for me. I became addicted and played every night until I beat it. The end may or may not disappoint you, but the overall experience should still be well worth the price. And even after you finish there are fan created custom stories to choose from and enjoy. Definitely play this game at night, no lights, and with headphones on!			",20,11,0,8,5,0,1

												Whilst I thought this game was great when I played it long ago, I am not sure I could still recommend it. I recently tried it again and found that it wasn't scary at all any more, and I scare easily. The thing that scared me the most was the thought of me being scared the first time I played all those years ago.That said, it can still be enjoyable and worth the money, if you are into psychological horror games. Just make sure to play it alone, at 3 a.m., in a thunderstorm and you'll be good to go.			",87,6,3,11,19,0,27

												This is the horror game you are looking for. Play this with headphones alone at night and you will experience a fear no other games or movies can give you. At the most intense moments, it's hard not to quit the game and leave the room in utter fear. You can't simply fight the monsters and ghosts in this game, so you will have to be careful not being spotted or not to make too much sound, or esle they'll come after you... and if they do, you need to run as fast as possible, while under the constant pressure of not going insane. If you are the kind of person looking for the scariest of games, this is the game for you. With a long, dark main story and a million DLC packs and user-created levels, the gameplay only ends when you're hiding under your bed, after smashing your PC in utter terror and fear.

												Amnesia has a special something that most games fail to acheive. That is what you become aware of almost as soon as you finish the game. The only way I could possibly describe the game once I finished was... Wow... Just wow... The game is probobly the example of what a horror game should be for all the indie creators and AAA developers out there. However, what does this game achieve in?To start off, we must discuss the story. The story is what makes up a game for me as a gamer. Game has bad story, its a bad game. There has only been a handful of games that go against this, but even still, those handful don't match the rest. However, Amnesia's story is phenomenal and a lot darker then you anticipate. When I entered, I thought this game was going to have a very gothic story (which it did) but did not see the grisly scenes of torture coming up on the plot. Even if this is all told in flashbacks and distrubing hallucinations, it does not take away from the fact the story is messed up. YOU WILL REGRET TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT YOU FORGOT. Daniel says to himself in the very beginning ""I choose to forget"" and you'll see why sure enough. To put it simply, do not doubt for a moment this game's story will get to you.Onto Gameplay, it's a straight through adventure with puzzles and terror thrown in the mix. The game is actually pretty open believe it or not, not Minecraft kind of open but a open where some of the rooms have little purpose but to be there. (Which is what I believe Amnesia: Machine for Pigs I lacking, but that's not the point). The castle is a fun place to explore and the puzzles why can have little things you might miss, truly are not frustrating. If you want a frustrating horror puzzle game, go to Anna:Extended Edition. While that was not a bad game at all, the puzzles get very annoying. Amnesia however masters the right balance of puzzles and terror and really make a good game out of it. Part of the gameplay as well, is as you might expect hiding, running, and screaming. I did not die much during the game, which is a good thing, but the moments I ran and hid sent chills rushing through my spine and got the adreniline pumping. However, I'll discuss that in scarinessThe game is scary, every moment is scary, this game is the scariest game out there. You will not know what to expect, and some of the areas will truly scare you. I got scared several times and panicked at little and big things, the game's atmopshere really prepares you for this game. If you don't believe me, do the ""immersion"" the game discusses at the beginning and do just that. You will surely have a heart attack... (I suggest calling 911 before playing the game, so in the eight minutes that it takes for them to arrive, you'll have to wait little)The last thing I need to discuss is the Audio and Graphics. The graphics look great, I have to say, maybe not what everyone else seems to find ""great"" these days but they are good. There were only two moments where I got a buggy graphic or thought ""They could have made this better"" but truly its good. The game was also made in 2010 when we still were just starting to improve graphics, so I have no complaints. The Audio however is what is really important to discuss, the Audio is what makes the game scary. The whole game I played with headphones, though it made me cower in fear and suffer serious mental issues, I don't regret a thing. There is a certain thing that the game does with it's audio, that just makes it so good. You don't even need a screen for some of the audio to send shivers down your spine. It sticks with you far after the game is done and when you hear that Grunt or Brute's cry of anger you will fear for your life.Overall, the game is excellent. Do not miss out on this game. It is one of the best game I have ever played in my life and sure as heck the best horror game.Story 9/10Gameplay 9/10Scariness 10/10Graphic & Audio 9/10Overall: 9/10			",134,61,0,12,11,1,5

The game's interactivity is nothing short of amazing, plus all the custom maps that the community creates makes sure that you are never without something new and exciting.

												I had been looking for a true horror game for some time. The first horror game that ever scared me was DOOM 3. Plenty of other people had recommended other games that ""scared"" them, but they were nothing compared to Amnesia. Amnesia has a driving storyline that always has you asking what will happen next, and what new bump will make you scream bloody murder. Seriously, buy it and play it in the dark. It's a great game!

												What can be said about Amnesia that hasn't already been said? Rather than attempt to quantify what makes Amnesia one of the most popular horror games to date, I'll just say that if you're looking for scares that are actually scary, look no further.Amnesia is a horror game with inventory puzzles and an odd little sanity mechanic I like to call ""hide and go soil yourself"". While my experience with other horror games has been limited, I can say without a doubt that Amnesia may provide one of the most visceral experiences you have ever gone through in a video game.Amnesia is an absolute joy to play with your friends. If you can manage the time, play through it once on your own, then invite your friends to play it and watch them experience it for the first time. Amnesia is the only game that I have found able to inspire such a feeling of well-meaning spite towards your friends. The kind of spite where you want them to go through the same horrors you did just to see who has better bladder control.When you're done with Amnesia, and you've plumbed the depths of any of the interesting custom levels made by the community, the previous, though unrelated story-wise, Penumbra series by the same developers can wring out a few more decent scares. Just make sure your heart can take it before purchasing.			",109,22,1,5,3,4,5

												This is a fantastic horror game. Although the ending is much shorter than I remember from videos I saw years ago, but really awesome nonetheless.I have seen so many Amnesia videos in the past, and yet, I still got scared playing this. The enemies in this game never cease to make me panic when they're chasing me, especially that water monster. That one scares me the most.I also thought there could have been more voice acting from whoever voiced Daniel when having a conversation with someone. But it is how it is, and doesn't really change how I feel about the game whatsoever.So I can honestly say that this is definitely one of my most favorite horror games ever.			",78,19,0,3,5,0,0

												One of the scariest, if not the scariest horror game on the market. Amnesia is similar to Penumbra in terms of puzzles, clever problem solving and a setting of helplessness in the face of your enemies. Caught within a Prussian medieval castle in the 1800's, you are immediately caught in the middle of the story, but due to amnesia (title drop) you have no recollection of past events, with nothing but a note to yourself and a feeling of being hunted on your mind. Amnesia: The Dark Descent, like Penumbra integrates very interactive physics that not only aid in the adrenaline rush of being chased by a gatherer with a slow-closing door but also said physics are key for the many puzzles of Brennenburg. After playing Penumbra though it's hard to deny that they're both the same type of game but in vastly different settings. In terms of horror, though, Amnesia takes the (blood-soaked) cake.

												Pros:-Can use surrounding objects to your advantage-Very Scary-Difficult, Challenging-Amazing Soundtrack-Interesting gameplay mechanics (Sanity Meter, can't stay in the dark long enough)-Levels are non - linear, which makes it feel more ordinary (Buildings aren't built in a linear fashion, a corridor would have mutliple rooms on the sides, etc).-Amazing atmosphereCons:-Monsters don't wander around for a long time, they spawn when the player walks in a certain area. There isn't a set number of Monsters that roam / patrol the area, which would make it so that you would have to spend a certain amount of time in an area.-Can't pick up candles / monsters are somewhat immune to objects (I can't hit a shovel very hard to stun a brute).-Game is somewhat short (They should have added some more levels / more rooms to explore).In other words, 8 / 10.

												I rate this game #1 constipation reliever. The whole dark atmosphere and the fact that there is always something lurking around the corner is very paranoia inducing. There is also the fact that there is absolutely NO way to defend yourself; running away and hiding is the only key to survival. Keeping your sanity, as well as your health, is a big factor in gameplay. Your character suffers from nyctophobia (the fear of darkness) which, as a result, causes your character to go insane when staying in the darkness for a prolonged amount of time. This sets a new difficulty for playing the game as you are easier to detect and movement becomes much harder while in this state. However, staying in light sources will make it easier for them to find you... I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for a thrill, alone or with friends. I also suggest playing in darkness with a headset on for maximum effects. This game is NOT for the faint of heart; do not play with winning as your goal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had been looking for a true horror game for some time. The first horror game that ever scared me was DOOM 3. Plenty of other people had recommended other games that ""scared"" them, but they were nothing compared to Amnesia. Amnesia has a driving storyline that always has you asking what will happen next, and what new bump will make you scream bloody murder. Seriously, buy it and play it in the dark. It's a great game!

												I think Amnesia : The Dark Descent is one of the scariest games ever made.We can understand that because the game was made by an independent developer. I really loved Amnesia because all the games that qualify themselves has ""Horror-Survival"" are not scary at all, I think about Left 4 Dead (even if I love this game too), when you see a zombie, you kill him with a shotgun and that's all. In Amnesia, you run and hide, the only answer to the encounter between you and a monster is to escape. The fear is omnipresent, when you hear screaming voices, when you open a door, when you go into the darkness of a room without light, your heart is going crazy. This is one of the game I will remember all my life as a game of quality.The game worths more than it's original price. However, I bought it and I didn't finish a level, yet.9/10			",185,29,8,13,9,2,37

												A fascinating little game.  At its absolute best, it delivers an exceedingly unsettling experience; at some point, you'll almost certainly find yourself cowering in a dark corner hoping desperately that something doesn't kill you and balancing the warm comfort of a candle against the risk something will come around the corner and rip your face off.  At its worst, it's a slow puzzler with sometimes-illogical requirements.Still, as a short, play-it-in-two-solid-sittings game, it's hard to top the  feel it delivers.  Well worth the 6-8 hours it'll take to finish.			",143,41,0,22,4,0,4

												I found out about this game through a review in PC Gamer magazine. I'll be the first to admit that I was skeptical about the mechanics (no weapons? what!?) but they are the key to the terror of this game. In any other scary game, you can just whip out a plasma cannon to destroy the things that scare you. In this game, all you can do is cower in fear and hide. This key mechanic, whereby you are rewarded for hiding raises the fear levels unlike anything I have ever played. When you round a corner in some dank, dark castle sub-floor and hear an inhuman growl, I guarantee you will soil your pants. The game itself oozes atmosphere, and it even encourages you to play in the dark with headphones on. This game is absolute ART that will TERRIFY you. I tell people all the time, ""Amnesia makes Dead Space feel like a walk through a sunny, butterfly-filled meadow."" There were literally moments where I had to step away from it to gather myself, it is THAT SCARY. Do yourself a favor and GET THIS GAME!			",217,12,6,5,13,1,8

												Rejuvenating survival horror. Perfect, endlessly unsettling sound design. Horrifying environments. Pure chilling Lovecraftian narrative told and unearthed in a consistently engaging manner. Puzzles that are simple enough to not become frustrating and challenging enough to not feel like pointless busywork. An unshakeable feeling of being chased and even in the dingiest corners being constantly out in the open and exposed to danger. Hiding from monsters that more often than not aren't there, abusing every inch of your imagination, and when they are there delivering terrifying sequences of frantic escape slamming doors behind you and terrified hiding cowering into walls desperately trying not to be seen, having to balance attempts at avoiding them with your dwindling sanity in the dark. Leaping from box to box in a flooded room avoiding the invisible creature that waits in the water, and the panicked rush to safety when you inevitably slip and hear the splashing rapidly approaching behind you. Lighting, sanity and ""flight not fight"" mechanics that have impacted so much in the five years since its release, making it hard to imagine the horror landscape of the 2010s without it. The defining horror game of the decade so far.			",175,50,0,13,5,1,16

												amnesia is truely nothing more then a awesome puzzle/horror game where you need to find your way out of the hell and go after some guy who cause all this. and besides that this game makes it scary with noises - music - monster and unexpected moments. and the most impresive is some hallways and places there that looks so extreemly beautiful even in low graphics.also the story is pretty interresting and it's really good and builded well. and here you have a link from one of my playtrough in this game about how I experience it and it also doesn't have any spoilers about the story.but my conclusion is: this game is totally worth it to buy it! and don't forget to check out my playtrough/gameplay video about it.

												I would be hard pressed to find any actual problems with Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The music, atmosphere, graphics, voice acting... it all comes together to create an experience that is positively terrifying. Until the Prison part that is. For some reason, by the time you reach the end of the Prison segment (which is the scariest area of the game), all tension deflates. Probably due to the fact, that anyone who pays attention will figure out the simple and heavily scripted enemy AI. While the story remains interesting and the atmosphere is still fantastic, the experience becomes more of the same. It is a great game though and everyone should play it.			",67,63,0,0,0,0,2

												Amnesia is a survival horror/adventure game hybrid with a great emphasis on tension and expectations.The main meat of Amnesia is exploring a hollow Polish castle while trying to recover the protagonist's lost memories. During the adventure you will have to secure both your sanity (which can indeed drop in front of strange sights and award you a game over) and your personal health (which can be depleted by attacks and other hazards).The horror aspects of Amnesia are mainly jump scares and the odd sensation that something is going to happen to you, eventually. While some people may not fall for these scaring tricks, Amnesia is nevertheless able to keep up the tension for the whole ride.The featured puzzles are neither intuitive nor incredibly hard, allowing you to navigate the various levels without the preoccupation of getting stuck for minutes for a single tricky riddleRegarding the level design in Amnesia, one must notice how easy can be to provide the player with imaginative, hollow, scaring environments without deploying elaborate graphical marvels. And this while keeping the game beautiful to look at, so to speak.The only questionable feature of the game are the monsters themselves: while dangerous in their own right and used very cleverly by the developers to add to the paranoia, they are apparently not very capable at hunting you down. It's indeed possible to evade them with ease with a basic stealth approach and sometimes they even tend to get stuck trying to reach you.All in all, a more than worthy indie title, with a clever usage of atmosphere for mind-breaking effects and scenary porn abound			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

												The quintessential Indie Horror game. Amnesia does everything right- a well built atmosphere, strange and horrifying monsters, and an amazing soundtrack. I also need to applaud the story- I was drawn in from the begining, and as I learned more and more about Daniel's tragic tale, I found myself horrfied- I felt betrayed, and then began to wonder why I was constantly telling myself, 'I would never do that.' I was daniel, and that above all else is the mark of a good horror game to me- to be so immersive that the player begins to believe it's real.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For good or bad, video games have trained us to expect and desire violence in our entertainment. We start up a new title, especially action or horror, looking for a gun or a shovel or some blunt object so we can handle the hordes of enemies surely coming our way. When a game not only removes straight-forward combat but takes all fighting options off the table, the fear is very real. Amnesia's design is masterful. This is a game that MUST be played in a dark room, with the headphones on. You cannot defeat the grotesques that haunt the castle, so look for some good places to hide. The visuals are incredibly disturbing and suit the game well, and there's a lively community of modders crafting their own tales of mystery and terror. If you're a horror fan, you owe it to yourself to play Amnesia. Just be prepared to stay awake until dawn.			",147,93,0,13,7,2,7

It actually immerses you into the environment and effectively creeps you out with the harmless events happening in the game. It bumps everything up even more because you can't fight your foe instead you must sneak around or stay stationary in the darkness as you watch a horribly disfigured enemy shuffle across your field of view...

												This game. This game is genius. There is no other way to describe it. Amnesia excels beyond any other game at making you feel completely helpless. Monsters? Yes. But weapons? A big fat NO. The only way you stay alive is by evading and hiding from monsters. And really, the scariness of Amnesia is not the monsters, but the lack thereof. It's the moments when you're walking through a completely silent hallway and your lantern oil runs out that are the scariest. I don't have any other words besides genius to describe this amazing work. Buy this game. You will be scared out of your wits at times, but when you finish the game as I did, you will realize its sheer genius.Well done, Frictional Games!

												I will be the first to say that some of the scares in this game are cheap and the programing is pretty predictable at times. Even when you know that sound you heard in one room is nothing, but that corner that is silent is most likely more dangerous, you still get a bit nervous. Honestly, this is probably one of the best and scariest horror games out there. Most people love this game, and it is easy to see why. You will spend most of the gameplay solving puzzles, and half way through the game you will find yourself hiding from monsters a lot. Even so, there are a few curve balls thrown into the game to make it feel fresh. One of my favorite disturbing moments in the game was when I had to try to get away from an invisible water creature by throwing remains acrossed the room hoping that it would go after that instead of me. This game is disturbing, frightening, and chilling, with a great story to boot. Fans of the horror genre will love this game.			",137,29,0,19,5,0,11

												Realmente me encantan los juegos de el Genero ""Terror"" y en Primera persona, para introducirlos un poco a lo que es ""Amnesia"", es una Secuela de los ""Penumbra"", el mismo estilo de juego, el juego consiste en que tienes que sobrevivir. Tan simple como eso, no puedes atacar, solo puedes correr, y es tan absorbente el juego que llegas a sentir el miedo real y la desesperación mientras juegas, Las graficas les doy un 8/10, porque muchos aspectos podrían haber sido mejores, y no tanto lo que son efectos, si no mismos objetos dentro del Juego, Esta la opción de jugar ""Customs"" apartes del juego original, y lo bueno que tienen, es que Absolutamente todas tienen una Historia, no es como un juego en el que tengas que sobrevivir así como así, tienes que entenderlo para poder avanzar, y pensar bien antes de actuar o simplemente mueres, 500% recomendable este en oferta o no.

												Looking for something scary? Then Amnesia is the game for you. Probably one of the most scariest games ever. This game doesn't focus on shock scares but goes deeper and is able to give true fear.			",562,104,33,72,42,3,56

												Amnesia is unlike other horror games. The horror in Amnesia The Dark Descent isn't just jumpscares, it is true horror making you on edge and scared the entire time you play giving you nightmares. The graphics and atmosphere in Amnesia is just perfect, and the music just puts you more on edge. not to mention the monsters with their torn faces, only adds excitement to this game. Recommended to play in the dark, with headphones, alone.                                                               10/10 Would buy again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A sweet, super short and absolutely spoiler-free review and opinion on the game Amnesia: The Dark Descent by Frictional Games.Close your door, shut down the lights and let the darkness sink in... The only visible light source being the computer monitor. The most rewarding experience will only be achievable in total darkness. Amnesia: The Dark Descent will take care of the rest.As a horror game this gets a lot of things right with just only a handful of annoyances mixed in. The game is definitely recommendable to anyone who is able to handle a lot of spooks and many more jump scares.The game goes even as far as planting some philosophical and truly thought provoking concepts in players head. So after one has beaten the game the memories about the “descending” aren’t necessarily the scary bits and pieces but the moments when the thoughts about “right” and “wrong” start to have debates in players mind. That’s perhaps the most rewarding aspect of the whole packet.My IGN-score: 8.5 / 10***SPOILERS (for those who really want to have a ‘clean’ experience)***Pros:- enjoyable surroundings- atmosphere- the dance of light and darkness (to put it nicely ^_^)Cons:- low resolution textures (the game is nearly seven years old so hardly surprising)- not enough notes, diaries etc to read (completely subjective viewpoint)- less appealing in the end (ok, this one is kinda a stretch {as I said there isn't much to criticise})			",30,4,0,0,1,0,0

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a revivification of the atmospheric horror game. Unable to fight the abominations that stalk you, Amnesia leaves you alone in a gritty atmospheric, slowly turning horrific, setting that pushes you toward finding the answers to your ailment, Amnesia. The game focuses on a few game-play mechanics such as health, mental health (though I believe is called insanity in the game), and finding what are essentially keys for the next zone (though are often items and puzzles) while for the most part being actively stalked by monsters. Some of the most notable elements of the game-play are the mental health meter and its gripping pacing. The mental health in the game involves your ability to stay in the light and avoid gazing at monsters for too long. The second being probably the most important feature. Once the unknown becomes the known it becomes a lot less frightful, so having a game-play mechanic that punishes the unknown becoming known it incredibly smart and well done and it is sufficient enough to last almost the entire game (the later areas somewhat abandon this concept, and it becomes a lot less scary for doing so). Until the end of the game it does a good job of pacing areas of horror and peace, though unannounced to the player, and never once did I feel cheated by the monsters. Overall I would suggest Amnesia to anyone who is looking for a dark, gripping, and atmospheric horror game that will last you a couple of days (approximately 8 hours of content).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty good game! It's very atmospheric and I love how the history of the character gets revealed little by little, which is kinda expected every time a game/movie/book has amnesia in it. Although this is a horror game, it's not filled with jumpscares. I remember maybe 2 throughout the entire game. The rest of the horror comes from the soundtrack, the ambience, and the layout of the castle (those loooong hallways or all of the corners are great to add suspense). The puzzles are pretty fun. None of them are difficult, which is a bit disappointing, but it also makes it so that you won't get stuck for very long any any one spot.I highly recommend this game, and I'm not usually a fan of horror.

												Amnesia The Dark Descent is a masterpiece, a great and compelling game in my honest opinion. It triggers mankind's most basic feelings and sensations while you play it, you feel like you're being watched and when an enemy spots you you feel really tense and the anxiety is so much when you're turning around a corner or when you're about to open a door that you can barely contain your own sanity. The sound design is magnificent and provides a great immersion into the game world. I honestly didn't progressed that much to the game because I quitted, the more I played it the more I was getting stressed and tense about it so I decided that Amnesia The Dark Descent is too much for me too handle in an emotional standpoint. That said, this game is great and everyone should try it but be warned that you might end up like me or you might end up experiencing one of the most compelling and immersive games ever in the history of gaming.

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of the best horror-survival games I've ever played. The ominous ambiance, the opressive feeling of helplessness, rotting decay, and sudden rush of adrenaline... it's even better than years ago, when it scared the heck out of me. What scared me the most back then, is that you're trying to be calm in your darkened room with your headphones and wet hands grabbing the mouse, when something makes you jump and race away. You NEED this game, not only because it's superbly designed, but for the originality of it, in a genre that has become rather dull. The graphics have not aged well, but the complexity of the game remains just the same. It took me two years to finish it the first time, even when  it's a long game... but because I couldn't bear the scares quite often. This time... I'm ready. ",160,50,3,28,20,5,29

												Disturbing, engrossing, and challenging, The Dark Descent is both a harrowing horror experience and a decently well realized narrative with careful attention paid to nailing the pacing subtleties.Gameplay is simple and has quality stealth mechanics and sound cues. The adventure game-y puzzles and a plethora of crafting tasks can get a little tiresome by the final strech, but I never lost the investment to beat the game. The experience begins itself perfectly, calling the player to persevere and conquer the ever consuming darkness and NOT be afraid (although you will be).Play it with the lights off and headphones. It's a great ride.			",55,10,0,5,1,0,0

												Amnesia is a pants sh*tting experience (nearly) throughout the whole game. It revived survival horror and brought it into the mainstream......however......once you discover the pattern behind the monster encounters, it's over. As in, the tension disappears and the fear factor becomes non-existent. In addition, the main protagonist's reactions are way overdone. He gets a seizure and hyperventilates each time a book falls off the shelf. It's not scary, it destroys immersion and makes the protagonist seem like a total wuss, especially when my own reaction to said book is a resounding 'meh'. I recommend it still since, other than horror, it can be an entertaining adventure game.For those curious, I will write about the pattern down below.*SPOILERS*It's not hard to discover the pattern, unfortunately.- The monster spawns are entirely scripted. They spawn very often once you take a puzzle item or solve a puzzle. Rarely when you enter a room.- To prevent from being killed, close the door to the room the puzzle or item are in before doing what you need to do. When the monster spawns, it starts attacking the door and gives you time to hide.- To hide, just break the line of sight. You don't even have to enter a dark area.- Keep being hidden until the monster music stops playing. Once this occurs, the monster literally despawned, i.e. it vanished, disappeared. You can now run around freely until a next monster spawns.There are one or two exceptions where the monster is already there, has a defined patrol route, and does not despawn.			",188,14,0,16,4,1,18

												Truly a worthy successor to the Penumbra Series and vastly more scary, Dark Descent is DAMN good.ScaresThis game is scary as all hell if you follow the directions (play at night or in the darkest room available, use headphone with good volume level, allow no distractions). From start the finish you feel your own insanity meter spiraling out of control as you immerse yourself into the atmosphere.. This game will have you begging for a brightly-lit room in which to collect your sanity before pressing on.PuzzlesThere are a solid amount of puzzles that are typically never obvious (A Machine for Pigs, I'm looking at you). There are also many items to collect and use throughout the game (A Machine for Pigs, I'm looking at you again). They also act as a contrast to the scary sections of the game, allowing yourself to take a break from being insane.Plot / StoryThe story takes a back-seat to nothing and aligns with what I would expect coming from the Penumbra series. If you are interested, the game provides a wealth of back-stories and side-stories to explore.Other Stuff- Game's good- You should buy it and play it- If you like it you should go buy the Penumbra series - 3 games for cheap!

This isn't a game with much replay value, as I believe if I played it a second or third time I wouldn't be nearly as scared as the first. However, there were some truly terrifying moments for me while playing this game that had my heart and adrenaline pumping.The voice acting, and story telling in this game keeps it moving at a good pace. I didn't ever really feel bored during my play through, although I did start getting a little annoyed at how much reading I had to do to discover the lore.

												I can confirm this is indeed scary. A scary game. If you can roll with that though, it's a really well made game thats very pleasant to play.. I mean, apart from all the gut-wrenching terror and all that. Pleasant is probably the wrong word. Sorry. Go on, play it... I dare ya.			",195,54,3,21,8,2,26

												Honostly I hate horror games but this is probably the best game i've played! The reason this game sticks out from the other horror games is because not just the monsters in this game make you want to shut the game off and sit in a corner and cry but the feel when you play the game just makes it feel like your being watched or being followed and cant do anything about it exept hide or run. Not just the gameplay is good but the story willl make you want to keep playing and playing until you get well attached to the game and start to want to play even more. Not only do you play the original story but play stories that other people made by a simple download. I really encourage you to play this game even if you dont like horror games.			",45,4,0,8,2,0,3

Also, there are no cutscenes which makes it more immersive and adds to the horror experience. I'd recommend you to buy this instantly.			",228,34,1,21,18,4,21

												Alrighty, another review! Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of those games that you see everywhere and wonder how creepy/eerie/scary it might be. Well you just come to the right place if you want to either♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants or learn a fascinating yet gory story. You wake up as Daniel and have no recolation as to where or how you got to where you are when waking up. As the story progresses (and I will try not to have any spoilers) you pick up notes and random journal entries that you had written before passing out and waking up in the beginning. As your memory gets better, you realize you had been working for an evil mastermind named Alexander who kidnapps victims and tortures them to be ""experiments"". Once found out this, you do whatever you can to stop Alexander. The rest is up to you to find out, besides everyone likes suprises. Now, when playing this game I was scared within 10 minutes of playing because of the creepy music, random voices and noises, and of course visuals which I will not spoil. If you turn your sound off completely though, it doesn't phase me one bit. So basically, if you are chicken♥♥♥♥♥♥then you should turn off your sound so you can focus on the main objective instead of focusing on what pair of underwear you need to wash from playing this. In all seriousness though, I would only reccomend someone who has a strong stomach since most of the game is quite gory and if dissassembled body parts freak you out then you shouldn't even be playing this game. I would like to add is that this game is medium length which I don't mind. I wish it was slightly longer but you can only do so much with a story and a horror game. Something to also add, this game has medium to hard difficulty puzzles which some had taken me days to figure out. So if you are one to rush and add cheats to the game well you are out of luck buddy because there are no cheats except for walkthroughs on the game online, and you must have patience. I would rate this game a 8/10 and reccomend anyone 16+  ",28,5,0,11,4,0,0

												Epic great ambiance, nice puzzles, nice physics (although a bit unnecessary and clunky sometimes), and the enemies... well, they are there to kill you once, then they don't spawn again there and you can continue the history, so it's like they are there just as a annoyance rather than a challenge. As I didn't felt any of them a challenge, I used a guide to remove them from the game so I could experience the ambiance and the level design. Great game, loved to wander the whole castle, loved the puzzles, and the story is quite good too.Recommended for those who are looking for a not much demanding/scary/hard survival horror game.

												Pretty good game! It's very atmospheric and I love how the history of the character gets revealed little by little, which is kinda expected every time a game/movie/book has amnesia in it. Although this is a horror game, it's not filled with jumpscares. I remember maybe 2 throughout the entire game. The rest of the horror comes from the soundtrack, the ambience, and the layout of the castle (those loooong hallways or all of the corners are great to add suspense). The puzzles are pretty fun. None of them are difficult, which is a bit disappointing, but it also makes it so that you won't get stuck for very long any any one spot.I highly recommend this game, and I'm not usually a fan of horror.

												Amnesia is one of the first games I played after joining Steam (thank you to the friend who urged me to play) and it drew me into the horror game genre. But Amnesia is still the favorite. The beginning may feel a bit slow to some, but trust me, keep going. This game got my heart beating faster and had me on the edge of my seat often. Turning corners and opening doors become terrifying things. And I'm not scared that easily. This game was a lot of fun for me. I became addicted and played every night until I beat it. The end may or may not disappoint you, but the overall experience should still be well worth the price. And even after you finish there are fan created custom stories to choose from and enjoy. Definitely play this game at night, no lights, and with headphones on!			",20,11,0,8,5,0,1

												Amnesia is a survival horror/adventure game hybrid with a great emphasis on tension and expectations.The main meat of Amnesia is exploring a hollow Polish castle while trying to recover the protagonist's lost memories. During the adventure you will have to secure both your sanity (which can indeed drop in front of strange sights and award you a game over) and your personal health (which can be depleted by attacks and other hazards).The horror aspects of Amnesia are mainly jump scares and the odd sensation that something is going to happen to you, eventually. While some people may not fall for these scaring tricks, Amnesia is nevertheless able to keep up the tension for the whole ride.The featured puzzles are neither intuitive nor incredibly hard, allowing you to navigate the various levels without the preoccupation of getting stuck for minutes for a single tricky riddleRegarding the level design in Amnesia, one must notice how easy can be to provide the player with imaginative, hollow, scaring environments without deploying elaborate graphical marvels. And this while keeping the game beautiful to look at, so to speak.The only questionable feature of the game are the monsters themselves: while dangerous in their own right and used very cleverly by the developers to add to the paranoia, they are apparently not very capable at hunting you down. It's indeed possible to evade them with ease with a basic stealth approach and sometimes they even tend to get stuck trying to reach you.All in all, a more than worthy indie title, with a clever usage of atmosphere for mind-breaking effects and scenary porn abound			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is worth a look if you like your horror. It's beautiful in style, soundtrack (and voice acting) and mood, and really gets you going if you play it at night. And you really should play it at night, because not only are you going to get a better scare in dim darkness, your many Steam friends will certainly be judging the character of a person who dilutes their fear to a manageable level.Without revealing too much, the storyline concerns the personification and mind of Daniel: a nyctophobic archaeologist (I know) who has left himself a note to kill the owner of Brennenburg Castle. More of the storyline is discovered when you find notes that Daniel has written for himself and pages of his diary. Piece by piece the story takes shape and gives you something to think about while treading the flagstones through the rooms.The gameplay revolves around Daniel solving puzzles, working machinery and occasionally running for his life. Or more to the point his sanity; not only do you have to keep your health up, you must defend your mind too. Standing around in the dark or activating something terrifying will drain away your will to live, and it means you must find or create sources of light to keep the insanity pangs at bay. The best aspect of the game of course is the atmosphere created when the shadow comes to hunt you down. You don’t see the monster very much, but at all times you’re on edge ready for when it strikes. And when the shadow does show up you’re completely clueless as to how to evade it, which makes Amnesia: The Dark Descent one of the best horror games, simply because the fear is happening in your own mind as opposed to jump-scares on the screen, and who knows what your mind can conjure up when it takes a trip into Amnesia…			",163,34,4,19,17,4,9

												So. Much. Mystery. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is by no means child's play, and I do not recommend it to the light-hearted. It's thick. Very thick. And the last eigth or so of the campaign is rather morbib. But if you're wanting an edge-of-your-seat game, this nailed it. Of course, I approached it wanting what it had to offer: mystery, thrill, and scare--and it delivered quite well. If you liked the Myst series, Amnesia brings about a whole new depth to venturing the unknown. Quite honestly, I had to buy the sequel the day after I finished it just to suffice my hunger for what The Dark Descent had given me--I can only hope The Machine for Pigs is half as good.UPDATE: It is. The Machine for Pigs has a story definitely worth playing, but I also admire the mechanics of The Dark Descent more. Also, I just can't get past how awesome the sound is in both.

												This horror game is one for the ages. It has the feeling of eerie aloneness, and at the same time making you feel as though you are being watched! This is a horror game like no other; because you can't fight back... only run, hide, and pray you're not found. You are a character named Daniel and you are trying to kill Alexander of Brennenburg. Alone the way you are aided with the flashbacks, notes, and voice of your former self. You're never safe. There is a shadow following you, and making it nearly impossible to accomplish your goal. It ranges from red slime to monsters out of your worst nightmares in this game. If you search, you will find lanterns, oil, tinderboxes, sanity potion and items that will help you progress in the game, be that keys, supplies to form acid to melt the red slime, ETC. It you are into games that are not only scary, but run a goal all at the same time, this is the game for you! So... can you kill Alexander and make it out alive; or die trying?			",8,1,0,2,1,0,0

												If you're any bit active in the gaming community, you've probably heard about this game. You've also probably heard that it is quite scary as well. You'd be right. Not only does this game contain fear, but it also contains heart. No, it's not a thinly or thickly veiled romance game. I mean, the developers at Frictional Games imbued their mind and body energy into this game and you notice this in the game with the optional commentary nodes. I never thought I'd say this, but a company besides Valve actually had really great commentary. They put in a ton of attention to detail and did a spectacular job in creating a world where immersion is as easy as W, A, S, D, and Space. The gameplay provides a nice balance of light and dark, where sanity, light, and not getting killed are resources. The game also makes your imagination your enemy, until you actually encounter one of the many Gatherers of Brennenburg Castle, and if you take enough time to get a clear glimpse of one, it'll rip your face off and use it as a book cover.  Daniel, Alexander, and Agrippa are all solid with good voices, the story is interesting and relevant to what you're doing, there's no side quest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and text documents provide well-needed info as how Daniel got into this predicament and how to solve some of the puzzles. Metacritic gave this game an 85/100 and that's garbage. They only had a few people and made a game 10 times scarier than most mainstream titles! In short, this game is scary, immersive, tells a good story, puzzle elements, stealth, and with the custom stories feature, offers a near-limitless amount of gameplay.

												OMG! This game is freaky as shiznit.  The graphics/locales, sound/music, enemies with the gashed/wrenched open mouths, the fleshy darkness taking over the game world occaisonally making it feel reminiscent of the otherwold in the earlier Silent Hill games, and the revelation of what Alexander had you doing to save yourself from said darkness, etc. all make this game an unforgettable experience. Also, the environmental puzzles are challenging to a fault, but in no way too challenging, and they feel like they are an integral part of the game's story/progression.If you haven't already played this yet then you need to do so ASAP!!  It should only take about 6-8 hrs real world time to beat it, so it doesn't feel like a cumbersome untertaking, especially if you're strapped for time, but also short enough to possible make you want to go back and play it again at a later date.

												I absolutely adore this game.The storyline is interesting and very present. You can't fight, only run. There is more than just the scary monsters chasing you through a dungeon though, so much more. Puzzles are scattered throughout the game, and there is even an alternate ending! (Yes, you have a choice at the end)Yes, everyone is naked except you and this one other guy, but it can be ignored (if you really try), and it can get a bit dark or gory, but if you can handle that, it is an amazing game!I love watching my friends play at night. (many screams have woken family members in my house!) Plus, once you have finished the main storyline (8 hours long by the way) there are endless custom stories you can download for free.I highly recommend this game.			",28,8,0,2,2,0,1

												Pros:Interesting story - The character you play as (Daniel) lost his memory, but a note he left to himself describes that he has to kill this evil man at the very bottom of this castle, deep in the dungeons. Along the way, you collect more of Daniel's diary and uncover the reason behind why this man needs to be dealt with.Creepy setting - The castle of Brennenburg is quite scary because the guy who owns this place is a horrible person and the story within this castle makes it all that much creepier. Some areas you come across make you not want to take another step forward because you know that there is some scary events that are about to go down in this area that you are about to progress through.Scary monsters - These 'servants' are freaky as hell, especially because you can't fight them back. You have to hide in the darkness so that they do not see you.Puzzles - I'd hate to admit it but I had to look up a few sections because I had no idea what to do. But there was one part where something you have to do to progress is so random that you would never guess unless you are some kind of strange genius.Music - When servants see you and are headed your way, the music really adds fear to the situation, like a scary movie in theaters. The music really matches this abandoned castle, because it makes you feel like you are alone, but you know you are not alone.Gameplay - Daniel loses his sanity the longer you are in the darkness...you need to reach lit areas to progress. You have to limit how many candles/torches you can light because you don't collect many tinderboxes. And if you light hallways, it could mean the death of you because if the servants see you and chase you down the hallway, they will still see you in this light and chase you all the way through. It is all made worse because you CANNOT FIGHT BACK!Scariness - OK, this is the scariest game I've played, and I'll tell you why. The developers didn't rely on cheap jump scares. They put in pure scary content, the monsters ('servants') are scarier than all hell, you panic when you even hear one of these creatures. When you run out of lighting resources (tinderboxes and lantern oil), you panic. When you enter certain areas, you know you are going to encounter these things just by looking through the entrance.Cons:Voice Acting - The voice acting in this game is subpar. Yes I understand that this isn't an A-list game, but you can get some better voice acting in here.Character Design - Every body except the servants in this game are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ The living humans you come across in this game have horrible design. The dead humans you come across in this game have horrible design. I know this is a strange thing to point out, but the naked bodies in this game are made like♥♥♥♥♥♥ The male bodies' junk is just a cylindrical lump on the body. My point is, if you can't make a body part right, cover it up, especially if it is an unessiantial body part to look at, like a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥The Ending - I won't spoil anything but I'll throw spoiler tags on it anyway...  The ending is quick, and then just done with. Roll credits Verdict:Even though this game has some issues, it is still a good game. You'll mainly enjoy it for the scares though, as the voices and graphics kill your vibe outside of the parts where you are running or hiding from the servants. This game is worth full price because it is only $20, and the amount of scary content you get in this game is worth it. It also has a decent replay value to it because you can get your friends to play this, and watch them spaz out while they play it. Recommended to anybody looking for some good scares.My rating: 6/10			",62,1,1,4,1,0,0

												Oh, Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Where could I begin? Coming from somebody who often frequents games in the horror genre, I can safely say this is the most terrifying game I have ever played. The thing about Amnesia is that even when there is no danger, the game still manages to install a feeling of dread into your mind for roughly 95% of the entire experience. The notes that can be read in the game, while not necessary to understand the story, add so much to the atmosphere. This game does not rely on cheap jumpscares, but when the moments of danger do come, they are presented in such a way in which you do not just jump in your seat for a second and laugh it off, but rather your heart starts to pound as you run down corridors and try to find a place to hide. Another great aspect of this game (which has unfortunately been copied, and badly, many times now) is that you have absolutely no means to defend yourself from the monsters, and you can only hope you can either outrun them (You can't) or hope you can't be seen in your hiding spot. All in all, I would say that Amnesia delivers a great story, near perfect atmosphere, and scares that will leave you crying for your mommy. Amnesia: The Dark Descent represents the best of the horror genre, and is a mix of great pacing, atmosphere, storytelling, graphics, and pure, bitter dread. I would recommend this game to basically anybody who loves the thrill of being scared, or anybody just looking for a new experience that differs from other games in general. 10/10			",13,9,0,0,1,0,0

												Really quite honestly suprised I didnt get to this sooner. Anyway Amnesia may be one of the only games I have played that has made me the man with a being scared factor of 0, utterly terrified. Now this may sound sketchy since you know its only a game. But for real you gotta try to see it for yourself. The ambience and atmosphere are at perfect creepy levels and then they throw in monsters for you to be even more terrfied of. However if you dont like puzzles and Im not talking spin this here and tada you win puzzles but actual you have to think puzzles dont play this. For the love of god dont play it if you dont like that type of thing I hear too much complaining as is about it. But other than that flawless game no complaints from me and I would suggest buying this game if you like horror, puzzles, and monsters. Also no you dont get guns because this♥♥♥♥♥♥aint call of mother♥♥♥♥ing duty.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At first I thought the graphics looked slightly dated and didn't think much of it, but once I started playing I couldn't focus on any of those misgivings while cowering under my desk.  This game has major jump-factor, more than Bioshock, more than Dead Space...it's unique in that you don't get to fight back, your only option is to run, to hide, to run, hide, run...and figure out puzzles while doing it.  It takes a steel nerve and a lot of careful strategy.  I WILL finish it, someday, I just can't take more than an hour at a time.  Do you dare?			",233,161,2,27,22,3,16

												If you're looking to make the clothes beneath your stomach nice and damp, go somewhere else........but if you're looking for a nice atmospheric game that will grip you with its story, and make you want to explore and experience: this is the game for you. Cause this game is ALL about your feeling of ""What the hell is going on?"", and by looking around you and finding pages from your diary you slowly uncover what has happened in this castle. Speaking of castle, it IS a rather spooky castle: I found myself jumping more from the creeks and the wind working on the old structure than the actual monsters, and some rooms are just messed-up fun.This game also has a great community for mods and custom maps, so this game has high replayability and length (some of the custom content might even manage to scare you...)There are some let-downs though, the most notable being the tediousness of the puzzles. If this game had any more puzzles, I'd call it Portal 3. The monsters not really being more than an inconvenience is also a minus, and a system were you slowly lose your sanity by not being close to light is just annoying: it ruins the atmosphere to have to lift your lantern every 3 meters. Overall it's a nice, tense experience. Having a mod community is ALWAYS a big plus for me. But it's not a great horror game. It may work nicely as your first horror game, if you're too afraid to try others.			",29,5,0,2,1,0,1

												I don't really find myself to be a fan of the horror genre.  That being said, I have somehow ended up with many different horror games, including Dead Space, Outlast, the FEAR series, and, of course, this game.  Of the games I listed, Amnesia: The Dark Descent has to be my favorite.  The atmoshpere is perfect throughout the game, especially in areas such as the Prison and the Choir.  There are a few jump scares throughout the game, which I don't like as much, but are fine in horror when limited, I just don't like the games that are completely based on them.  Amnesia is not one of these games, I find the atmosphere and the setting to be the main part of the horror, along with the stealth aspect of the game, where the main character has to hide in order to survive.  There is no charging through this game, the player must take their time in order to progress, but they cannot be too slow, otherwise the sanity bar drains, and the game gets creepier, hallucinations occur more, and sometimes the game actually changes.The steam version includes the Justine Expansion, an hour long expansion with the luxury of choice in it, do you wanna be a jerk and let the people die, or save them?  It also includes a little thing called *Remember*, which I have not tried yet.  Both can be accessed through the settings configuration tool that is accessed during launchup.Positives:- Horror aspect not based on jump scares, like Slender was.- It's actually creepy, and the environment is just unsettling.- There is the perfect amount of the survival aspect- Monsters are an actual danger, and not just for appearence.  The monsters cannot be killed, with the exception of the water monster- the water monster can be killed by bashing it over and over with a box or barrel, until the yellowish blood can be seen and the activity stops.- Custom Stories- It gave me 8 hours of gameplay, which is pretty good for a linear horror game.Negatives:- I find there to be a lack of replayability in the game.  I've beaten it once, and I don't really need to play it again.  That being said, I'm attempting a speed run soon.  I basically just contradicted myself there, but I'm not gonna play it again without some sort of challenge for myselfHow well does it run?This game is surprisingly taxing, for it basically being darkness, with a few monsters thrown into it.  I have my crappy Dell Laptop (CPU-i-7 3612QM Quad Core 2.1 GHz, RAM-8 GB DDR3, Graphics-Intel HD 4000, Screen-1600x900) running this game on custom settings at 30 FPS.My settings:Texture Filter: BilinearSSAO- On, Resolution-Medium, Samples-8Edge Smooth- OnWorld Reflection- OnAnisotropy- 8xParallax- OnIt may be that my settings are too high for the computer, but I'm so used to 30 FPS that it isn't a big deal.  This will run better on a better computer with a dedicated GPU.			",287,51,3,55,37,0,64

												Although I have a stronger constitution than most when it comes to horror games and had heard much about Amnesia that I went in with certain expectations in place, I can safely say the game did shatter them easily. Rather than relying on jump scares entirely, it exudes an atmosphere that lends itself well to paranoia and suspense that will leave you looking in drawers for some tinder long after the game ends, to say the least.

												9/10This game is a must-play for any fans of horror games! Everything is remarkably well done. The feeling of the game is so realistic, so realistic that you don't feel your own fear, you feel Daniel's fear. You get connected to the enviornment and characters in a way that I didn't believe possible in a game. They mean it when they tell you to not play this game to win, but reather to immerse yourself in the story, because it truly is a terrifying one. Amnesia plays on every kind of fear. One moment you feel merely nervous, the next you are running for your life in sheer terror after experiencing a horrific jumpscare. I would highly recommend this game to anyone!			",50,41,0,6,4,1,10

When played in the dark, alone, and with a headset this game is almost certain to scare you with its dark score (which almost certainly makes use of infrasound) and immersive environment and gameplay.

												Really quite honestly suprised I didnt get to this sooner. Anyway Amnesia may be one of the only games I have played that has made me the man with a being scared factor of 0, utterly terrified. Now this may sound sketchy since you know its only a game. But for real you gotta try to see it for yourself. The ambience and atmosphere are at perfect creepy levels and then they throw in monsters for you to be even more terrfied of. However if you dont like puzzles and Im not talking spin this here and tada you win puzzles but actual you have to think puzzles dont play this. For the love of god dont play it if you dont like that type of thing I hear too much complaining as is about it. But other than that flawless game no complaints from me and I would suggest buying this game if you like horror, puzzles, and monsters. Also no you dont get guns because this♥♥♥♥♥♥aint call of mother♥♥♥♥ing duty.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*The* scariest game I've ever played. Play through the whole thing alone in the dark with headphones on, and you're a braver man than I.This title was the follow up to Frictional's Penumbra series, and continues the same style of play. However, unlike Penumbra where the darkness was your friend, it's an ever-present threat in Amnesia. Staying in the dark for too long will slowly scratch away at your sanity, causing you to see and hear things that aren't there. Insanity causes your character to behave erratically, essentially turning you into walking monster pheromone.Seeing as lantern oil and tinderboxes are in limited supply, this serves to drive the player forward through the game.The sound design is really fantastic, the graphics are admirable and the environment and monsters are diabolically nightmarish. The only thing keeping this from being a perfect horror title are some simple gameplay exploits.			",639,171,18,117,49,5,117

												I've been a huge fan of horror movies since the mid-nineties and have played nearly every horror game out there, but nothing compares to the discomfort I felt playing this game through for the first time. When played in the dark, alone, and with a headset this game is almost certain to scare you with its dark score (which almost certainly makes use of infrasound) and immersive environment and gameplay. Definitely a must play for horror fans.			",184,32,0,43,4,1,7

And I knew a lot of them in my life (not braggin - I know some felt more of them in their lifetime). So if you want to play a scary game - bring a friend who does too, find a quiet place like a cabin in the woods or something similar, wait for the Sun to go down and launch the game.

												This game is a true masterpiece. Disturbing, mind-blowingly scary and more intense than your granny on drugs and skates. Take control of, and see through the eyes of Daniel, an English archeologist who suddenly finds himself trapped inside the huge, dark and seemingly haunted castle of Brennenburg. Waking up, remembering nothing about his former self, Daniel emerges out on an adventure he won't soon forget...You'll wish you never bought the game, yet you will get scared, and you will like it. You'll be completely glued to the screen for hours, trying to find the correct path, or the right set of rods for that damned broken elevator. Monsters will be chasing you, and all you have to ""defend"" yourself with is a lamp, with barely enough oil to get you through sticky situations. The darkness will swallow you, and your sanity will be tested both inside and outside the game.In conclusion, you'll♥♥♥♥♥♥brix, and you'll♥♥♥♥♥♥'em hard! Totally worth the low sum of 30 bucks.

												Somewhere between all the YouTube wecams and mindless fans blindly praising Amnesia, is a game that I don't think quite lives up to the hype as the ""scariest game of all time,"" but is still pretty damn good.As we all know, the game takes place in a deserted castle and you play as Daniel, a man who awakes with amnesia. As you wander around the castle for the next few hours, you'll learn about the history of both the castle and it's caretaker, and Daniel's intentions for being there. The game is excellent at building tension and atmosphere, you will hold your breath many times while walking the halls of the castle.The gameplay is where some of the problems begin to arise. I just found the game to be a little too forgiving. The tinderbox system is pretty much broken; I had a ridiculous number of them at the end of the game, somewhere in the 20s. The sanity meter is interesting enough, but I never really felt threatened if it got to a high level. If the meter gets too high, Daniel will pass out and awake after a few seconds. This happened once or twice during my playthrough, but nothing seemed to change afterwards. However, the absolute worst aspect is the enemy AI; Once you figure out the secret of their pathfinding and realize that they only stick to certain areas, the game becomes a breeze, and all feelings of horror and fear are lost. The puzzles aren't very tricky, but I did have to look up where to go once (I had to stack boxes because there was a hatch on a cieling... go figure).So while Amnesia does capture a constant feeling of dread, you can only be as scared from the game as you want to be. It makes no attempt to hide that it is in fact, just a game.Do I recommend Amnesia: The Dark Descent? Yes, to every horror fan. Old school horror fanatics will be pleased by this treat, and younger fans will scream at their Twitch followers.			",163,30,1,8,6,2,5

												First off, I've played this game offline as well so I probably have around 70-80+ hours into this game as of this date.Unless you get scared REALLY easily, this isn't a terrifying game. Where the horror lies is in the atmosphere. You feel isolated, yet always with that sensation that someone, or something is watching you... I could go on and on about what I love about this game. I really could. It has aged wonderfully. The voice acting is spot on. The music is amazing and really sets the mood. No weapons, nothing to defend yourself; it is a true psychological survival horror. The custom story feature extends the replayability considerably. No game is perfect though, and Amnesia needs patches, which unfortunately it will probably never receive. I recently completed a no lantern/tinderbox run and got stuck in a wall. There are areas in the game where such a ""feature"" can be exploited for speed runs, but that was not one of them! And in many areas if you die enough times, the enemies will not respawn... go ahead and exploit that, you cheater. :P			",136,45,0,14,15,3,12

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent pits you against occult, nightmarish horrors and the terror of darkness. The nice twist is that it does this by taking away from you the things you always can depend on in your other games: your sanity, your ability to see your surroundings, and most importantly, your ability to fight and defend yourself. You will have to hide and flee in order to survive. If you have the power to suspend disbelief, and enjoy the feeling that something is watching you from the shadows, this is a game that is not to be missed.			",314,73,6,32,16,0,33

												Now I'm not usually one for horrific/suspensful games, but I must say, the experience alone is enough to keep me coming back. One big plus is that the game doesn't demand a lot of horror actually. I don't feel that something gory needs to be on screen all the time for me to be scared. These game designers are masters at building an environment where you feel totally alone and susceptible. The sounds are terrifying, the lighting is convincing, and the story is seductively alluring.If you're looking to step out of your conventional gaming boxes and try something completely new and original, I highly recommend this game.

												So you want a horror game? You've come to the right place. Amnesia is full of scares of all kinds, and the nearly unlimited fan-made custom stories only increase the terror. If you are a true horror fan, you MUST play this game. It is not a suggestion; it is a   requirement. And if you are not a horror fan, why not give it a try? (I just want to see you jump in fright, honestly.) Basically, this game is great for scares (of all varieties: tense atmosphere, chase scenes, and of course, jumpscares). However, I feel it is my duty to speak of the bad parts of Amnesia. Firstly, and most importantly, nobody in the game wears clothes. They are also all male. I don't know why the developers decided to do this, but they did. So, be warned. Male anatomy is unavoidable in this game. Secondly, there is a heavy theme of torture in this game. I don't like it, nobody really does. But it does increase the sense of fright, and nothing is actually shown (nothing realistic, at least). Other than that, this game is ridiculously cool. Oh, and one more thing. The only weapon you have... is stealth, and if that fails, running. You are helpless against the monsters that pursue you, which goes a long way towards increasing the scare level. Go buy this game now, if you are hungry for horror.			",140,30,7,5,5,0,1

												I was looking at my surrondings during the intro scene, saw a statue and freaked out, NA/10. On a more serious note I will update this review as I spend more time playing this gameUpdate: Played this for over an hour now, what I like about the game so far is my character's sanity, I think after I start having a headache the screen will sometimes tremble :D. I'm almost disappointed that the few enemies I encountered didn't notice me yet, hope they never will, apparently you are supposed to try to hide from them anyways.Update (3hrs played):So far I'm loving this game, some aspects feels a bit unnatural but that's probably because I haven't fit the mysteries of the story together yet, game isn't as scary as I thought it would be, feels more like a thriller than horror (for the time being at least), but still awesome.Update (completed):After completing the game, I was very satisfied with the alternate endings. Overall the game gave me a constant thrilling feel, with the occasional scares.I strongly recommend this game, 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A wonderfully, terrifying experience.Turn off the lights, put your headphones on and enter the world of Amnesia. The ambiance of Amnesia provides a level of immersion seldom presented in a game. Every element, particularly the sound, is crafted with care and detail. The game doesn't utilize jump scares or gore, but tension as a way to convey the fear and crumbling sanity of the protagonist. The game play is simple, as you are provided no weapons (further aiding a  feeling of helplessness) and do not expect any innovative mechanics. In general, the game is like a warm bath of dread. Just let the uneasiness sink in and enjoy the calming descent into madness.			",31,2,0,0,2,0,2

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Atmospheric Horror  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can have multiple Profile Save slots.There is only a Master volume Bar and You can change the number between 1 and 10.There are MANY different resolution sizes.You can play this game fullscreen or windowed mode.There is a Gamma(Brightness) Bar.There are some Different languages.You can use your xbox controller.About the game.You are playing with a character that has Amnesia. You are wandering in some kind of castle finding for clues and items. You interact with objects on the way you will also do in real life. Darkness is the most common enemy in this game. If standing too long in the darkness, Your sanity will slowly drain. You have a health bar and sanity bar. The game has a deep storyline and following clues and solving things will increase your sanity bar. You can find Oil and tinderboxes to create some light in the room. You are able to bring and carry around an oil Lantern. Each time you light up a candle with a tinderbox, it will consume 1 dose.You can find Commentary developer icons (Telling you background details about the game). You can turn this off however.Voiced over with Subtitles.Great Atmosphere.Great deep story and background story details.Realistic interacting with objects but sometimes really buggy.Character walks slow.Great Puzzles.Other things.No Jumpscares! AS A HORROR GAME SHOULD BE!Some of the Voice acting from the ""Commentery developer icons"" are difficult to understand. Because of Accent or microphone quality.Developers commentary COULD SPOIL THINGS!-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			",467,171,6,45,49,1,62

												To the guy that bought me this game, F**k you mark. I was expecting a spooky game, but for me, merely adjusting the brightness levels on the main menu is terrifying enough for me. Not even an hour into playing the game I already had to change my underwear 3 times because I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥myself so often out of fear. I now have to constantly play this game on the toilet so I don't mess up my carpet or clothes again.I also found out that this game is not suitable for children, the hard way. I let my 7 year old cousin play this game and told him ""It's the new mario kart"", 10 minutes later this kid is running out of the room crying because some 18 foot zombie sprayed his brain over the wall (what a ♥♥♥♥♥, I was never like this when I was 7). Anyway I'm not invited to family reuinions anymore.Apart from the family tension and constant urination, this is a pretty decent game, 8/10. Not bad, not bad at all			",23,6,0,0,0,2,4

												I would like to start this review by pointing out that I do not like horror games or horror in general.HOWEVER.This game blew my mind when I played it. It has the perfect atmosphere, an actual storyline (which not many horror games can claim to have) and no pathetic, all-of-a-sudden jumpscares out of nowhere. With that being said, you are on the edge of your seat the whole game, waiting for something to jump out from the shadows. I especially like the ""sanity"" implentemation, giving another meter to watch out for.This is the only horror game I have ever truly liked, as a game, and as a story. Definitely give this one a try, people.			",47,4,0,8,6,0,4

												9/10This game is a must-play for any fans of horror games! Everything is remarkably well done. The feeling of the game is so realistic, so realistic that you don't feel your own fear, you feel Daniel's fear. You get connected to the enviornment and characters in a way that I didn't believe possible in a game. They mean it when they tell you to not play this game to win, but reather to immerse yourself in the story, because it truly is a terrifying one. Amnesia plays on every kind of fear. One moment you feel merely nervous, the next you are running for your life in sheer terror after experiencing a horrific jumpscare. I would highly recommend this game to anyone!			",50,41,0,6,4,1,10

												This is one of the scariest games in recent memory. The loading screen recommends you turn the lights off and play with headphones, something I'll strongly echo. Amnesia: The Dark Descent's puzzles aren't especially impressive and the voice acting can range from convincing to goofy, but the atmosphere Frictional has infused into the experience is as powerful as they come. It's a tale of terror that's menacing and disturbing from the very first moments, and only amplifies the further you progress. Any fan of horror, every Lovecraft fan, and any with even a hint of curiosity should give Amnesia a shot!!In Frictional Games' Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you get no gun. When a gruesome shambling creature rounds a corner on wobbly knees and its yawning rictus comes into focus, you can only succumb to its onslaught or flee in terror, hoping the shadows will provide safe haven. It plays more like a first-person adventure game than anything else, and borrows many of the environmental manipulation mechanics of Frictional's previous Penumbra series. It's a fairly short game, but one that's near impossible to forget.What follows is a tale told mostly in flashback as you' re beset by ghostly visions and uncover journal entries on dimly lit desks that tell of scientific expeditions that lead to the discovery of ancient terrors. By itself the story is strong enough, and told effectively assuming you take the time to explore and pick up a majority of the notes. Yet what really adds a quality of unsettling authenticity to the tale is the unshakeable feeling of pursuit and inevitability of some kind of horrific climax.			",954,410,28,71,96,9,110

												Now I'm not usually one for horrific/suspensful games, but I must say, the experience alone is enough to keep me coming back. One big plus is that the game doesn't demand a lot of horror actually. I don't feel that something gory needs to be on screen all the time for me to be scared. These game designers are masters at building an environment where you feel totally alone and susceptible. The sounds are terrifying, the lighting is convincing, and the story is seductively alluring.If you're looking to step out of your conventional gaming boxes and try something completely new and original, I highly recommend this game.

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an instant horror classic, it's creepy atmosphere and level design keeps you constantly alert of everything in fear of encountering terrifying monsters unprepared. The best feature in the game is being able to download and create custom stories, which increases the game's replayability and expanding it's community by bringing  new ways to apply pressure and fear (other than teleporting naked guy jumpscares). Overall, this game is an endless cycle, it gives me a sense of adventure of wanting to experience what the game has to offer, but i don't want to explore in fear of what the game has to offer, all it takes is some courage to delve into a fascinating and terrifying experience.

												If you're thinking about getting this, I recommend it. It will put fear into you like no other, the atmosphere and the sounds that are constantly around you will drive you absolutely insane. It's best to play at night, with a good pair of headphones and maybe even a camera to record your reaction. 10/10Would spook again.			",39,20,0,12,8,0,0

												It was alright. PDP honestly milked this game for far more than what it was worth. I enjoyed the ride and it was on sale when I bought it...can't complain. I only put in 20-ish hours, but I never bothered with mods. I played this ""co-op"" with a friend of mine and we had some good laughs. I reccomend playing this game ""co-op"" as well!

												This is an amazing horror game that builds up tension like Slender, has jump scares like Outlast, and an amazing story line such as The Last of Us. The game is actually based off of true legends of Castle Brennenburg in Poland, the setting of the game. Amnesia is deep, and has recently been labeled as one of the top horror games ever made.The environment in this game is very fitting, and you can manipulate objects to your advantage. The monsters are creative and unique and the ambience is unbeatable. As you walk through castle Brennenburg, you can automatically tell that this was perfect for a horror story.This game is not straight forward all of the time though. There are puzzles designed to challenge the player, while panicking in fear of the next monster. Each part of the game can be taken at the gamer's own pace, depending on if you are a cautious player, or the run-in-head-first player. Another thing that is great about this game is that it does not shove plot into your face. You can choose to pick up the notes that are scattered around the castle, or ignore them to complete the game. There are bits though, that are crucial to the end of the game that are forced upon you. There is a total of two cut scenes, at the beginning and the end of the game; that is if you do not count the times you regain your memory. These are short, although quite frankly annoying and tedious. The game in itself has removed most of the problems, but can get glitchy at some points. Occasionally, one of the monsters will get stuck in a wall or you will have troubles with some of the items, but are easy to ignore. Over all this game is perfect for any horror gamer, but should be avoided if you do not enjoy puzzles. The ending is not one you should miss, and will bring you about 10 hours of nerve-wracking gametime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When a game has the power to evoke an emotional reaction, other than frustrion and dissapointment, then said game deserves to be considered a success and that is just the case with Amnesia as it's hauntingly gothic dungeons, goulish enemies and bone-chillingly primordial sound design work to instill a sense fear and helplesness. Set in the 19th century Amnesia finds you journeying into the darkest recesses of a medieval castle without the aid of a firearm and punishes your character's very mind, making it difficult to navigate, if you stray a little too far from the light.

												Easily one of the most rich, well-designed, and fun video games I've ever played.  As with SOMA, Frictional manages to create vast, believable worlds, dripping with atmosphere and immersed in story, and they do it without non-stop shooting of guns.  I anxiously await Frictional's next accomplishment, even if I have to wait years for it.I expected this game to be very scary -- there were a few moments, but once I got into the groove of the game, it was more of an exciting story to be a part of and less of a horrific experience.  I was fine with that.  I felt more genuine terror when playing SOMA.My only complaint, which resonates throughout the Frictional catalog for me, is that the puzzles are rather pedestrian.  I almost wish they were left out altogther, in favor of more story.  In contrast to SOMA, the monsters in this game did not detract from my abililty to explore, because they wandered so far away and were trivially easy to hide from.No matter.  My very highest recommendation.  Take the advice about turning off the lights and headphones for best possible atmosphere.  Soak it all in and be transported for a few wonderful hours.

												This horror game is one for the ages. It has the feeling of eerie aloneness, and at the same time making you feel as though you are being watched! This is a horror game like no other; because you can't fight back... only run, hide, and pray you're not found. You are a character named Daniel and you are trying to kill Alexander of Brennenburg. Alone the way you are aided with the flashbacks, notes, and voice of your former self. You're never safe. There is a shadow following you, and making it nearly impossible to accomplish your goal. It ranges from red slime to monsters out of your worst nightmares in this game. If you search, you will find lanterns, oil, tinderboxes, sanity potion and items that will help you progress in the game, be that keys, supplies to form acid to melt the red slime, ETC. It you are into games that are not only scary, but run a goal all at the same time, this is the game for you! So... can you kill Alexander and make it out alive; or die trying?			",8,1,0,2,1,0,0

												If you're any bit active in the gaming community, you've probably heard about this game. You've also probably heard that it is quite scary as well. You'd be right. Not only does this game contain fear, but it also contains heart. No, it's not a thinly or thickly veiled romance game. I mean, the developers at Frictional Games imbued their mind and body energy into this game and you notice this in the game with the optional commentary nodes. I never thought I'd say this, but a company besides Valve actually had really great commentary. They put in a ton of attention to detail and did a spectacular job in creating a world where immersion is as easy as W, A, S, D, and Space. The gameplay provides a nice balance of light and dark, where sanity, light, and not getting killed are resources. The game also makes your imagination your enemy, until you actually encounter one of the many Gatherers of Brennenburg Castle, and if you take enough time to get a clear glimpse of one, it'll rip your face off and use it as a book cover.  Daniel, Alexander, and Agrippa are all solid with good voices, the story is interesting and relevant to what you're doing, there's no side quest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and text documents provide well-needed info as how Daniel got into this predicament and how to solve some of the puzzles. Metacritic gave this game an 85/100 and that's garbage. They only had a few people and made a game 10 times scarier than most mainstream titles! In short, this game is scary, immersive, tells a good story, puzzle elements, stealth, and with the custom stories feature, offers a near-limitless amount of gameplay.

												OMG! This game is freaky as shiznit.  The graphics/locales, sound/music, enemies with the gashed/wrenched open mouths, the fleshy darkness taking over the game world occaisonally making it feel reminiscent of the otherwold in the earlier Silent Hill games, and the revelation of what Alexander had you doing to save yourself from said darkness, etc. all make this game an unforgettable experience. Also, the environmental puzzles are challenging to a fault, but in no way too challenging, and they feel like they are an integral part of the game's story/progression.If you haven't already played this yet then you need to do so ASAP!!  It should only take about 6-8 hrs real world time to beat it, so it doesn't feel like a cumbersome untertaking, especially if you're strapped for time, but also short enough to possible make you want to go back and play it again at a later date.

												So. Much. Mystery. Amnesia: The Dark Descent is by no means child's play, and I do not recommend it to the light-hearted. It's thick. Very thick. And the last eigth or so of the campaign is rather morbib. But if you're wanting an edge-of-your-seat game, this nailed it. Of course, I approached it wanting what it had to offer: mystery, thrill, and scare--and it delivered quite well. If you liked the Myst series, Amnesia brings about a whole new depth to venturing the unknown. Quite honestly, I had to buy the sequel the day after I finished it just to suffice my hunger for what The Dark Descent had given me--I can only hope The Machine for Pigs is half as good.UPDATE: It is. The Machine for Pigs has a story definitely worth playing, but I also admire the mechanics of The Dark Descent more. Also, I just can't get past how awesome the sound is in both.

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent is worth a look if you like your horror. It's beautiful in style, soundtrack (and voice acting) and mood, and really gets you going if you play it at night. And you really should play it at night, because not only are you going to get a better scare in dim darkness, your many Steam friends will certainly be judging the character of a person who dilutes their fear to a manageable level.Without revealing too much, the storyline concerns the personification and mind of Daniel: a nyctophobic archaeologist (I know) who has left himself a note to kill the owner of Brennenburg Castle. More of the storyline is discovered when you find notes that Daniel has written for himself and pages of his diary. Piece by piece the story takes shape and gives you something to think about while treading the flagstones through the rooms.The gameplay revolves around Daniel solving puzzles, working machinery and occasionally running for his life. Or more to the point his sanity; not only do you have to keep your health up, you must defend your mind too. Standing around in the dark or activating something terrifying will drain away your will to live, and it means you must find or create sources of light to keep the insanity pangs at bay. The best aspect of the game of course is the atmosphere created when the shadow comes to hunt you down. You don’t see the monster very much, but at all times you’re on edge ready for when it strikes. And when the shadow does show up you’re completely clueless as to how to evade it, which makes Amnesia: The Dark Descent one of the best horror games, simply because the fear is happening in your own mind as opposed to jump-scares on the screen, and who knows what your mind can conjure up when it takes a trip into Amnesia…			",163,34,4,19,17,4,9

												Pros:Interesting story - The character you play as (Daniel) lost his memory, but a note he left to himself describes that he has to kill this evil man at the very bottom of this castle, deep in the dungeons. Along the way, you collect more of Daniel's diary and uncover the reason behind why this man needs to be dealt with.Creepy setting - The castle of Brennenburg is quite scary because the guy who owns this place is a horrible person and the story within this castle makes it all that much creepier. Some areas you come across make you not want to take another step forward because you know that there is some scary events that are about to go down in this area that you are about to progress through.Scary monsters - These 'servants' are freaky as hell, especially because you can't fight them back. You have to hide in the darkness so that they do not see you.Puzzles - I'd hate to admit it but I had to look up a few sections because I had no idea what to do. But there was one part where something you have to do to progress is so random that you would never guess unless you are some kind of strange genius.Music - When servants see you and are headed your way, the music really adds fear to the situation, like a scary movie in theaters. The music really matches this abandoned castle, because it makes you feel like you are alone, but you know you are not alone.Gameplay - Daniel loses his sanity the longer you are in the darkness...you need to reach lit areas to progress. You have to limit how many candles/torches you can light because you don't collect many tinderboxes. And if you light hallways, it could mean the death of you because if the servants see you and chase you down the hallway, they will still see you in this light and chase you all the way through. It is all made worse because you CANNOT FIGHT BACK!Scariness - OK, this is the scariest game I've played, and I'll tell you why. The developers didn't rely on cheap jump scares. They put in pure scary content, the monsters ('servants') are scarier than all hell, you panic when you even hear one of these creatures. When you run out of lighting resources (tinderboxes and lantern oil), you panic. When you enter certain areas, you know you are going to encounter these things just by looking through the entrance.Cons:Voice Acting - The voice acting in this game is subpar. Yes I understand that this isn't an A-list game, but you can get some better voice acting in here.Character Design - Every body except the servants in this game are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ The living humans you come across in this game have horrible design. The dead humans you come across in this game have horrible design. I know this is a strange thing to point out, but the naked bodies in this game are made like♥♥♥♥♥♥ The male bodies' junk is just a cylindrical lump on the body. My point is, if you can't make a body part right, cover it up, especially if it is an unessiantial body part to look at, like a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥The Ending - I won't spoil anything but I'll throw spoiler tags on it anyway...  The ending is quick, and then just done with. Roll credits Verdict:Even though this game has some issues, it is still a good game. You'll mainly enjoy it for the scares though, as the voices and graphics kill your vibe outside of the parts where you are running or hiding from the servants. This game is worth full price because it is only $20, and the amount of scary content you get in this game is worth it. It also has a decent replay value to it because you can get your friends to play this, and watch them spaz out while they play it. Recommended to anybody looking for some good scares.My rating: 6/10			",62,1,1,4,1,0,0

												Before buying this game, you'll be wanting to do a quick google search on how to get it running. I bought the game (on sale, a small positive point) only to find out that after two hours of trying to get it to run, it was entirely incompatible with my computer. Still, played it at a friend's place and its great, so there's that. That's why the review is positive, but srsly, before buying, look it up.			",47,19,1,8,7,0,10
