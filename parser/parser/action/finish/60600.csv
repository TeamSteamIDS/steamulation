												SHMUP+Upgrades+Coop = Great but, without really any online community to speak I suggest you buy this game with 3 others if you plan to really enjoy it.			",380,90,9,67,26,3,51

												ProtoGalaxy is a classic example of a shootemup or bullethell game, it reminds me of pretty much every classic arcade  rail shooter I have ever played. one major difference here is that there is a map builder and story missions, those are a pretty neat addition.  ProtoGalaxy looks super old, and there is no multiplayer community whatsoever, but the game is free so that is another plus, it provides a decent amount of single player fun and I would recommend anyone interested in the classic arcade feeling of the game to go ahead and give it a try.  I have not had any problems with the game besides the Steam achievements not working.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												I liked the concept, I bought the game. No decent controller support: partial controller support is claimed but how do you configure it remains a mystery. No online help found. Too bad.			",104,21,0,10,2,0,8

												A fairly fun scrolling shooter with a lot of ship customization. It lacks a bit of polish, and the upgrading system is kind of confusing, after you get the hang of it, you should be fine. It features four-player co-op as well (even local co-op), which is always a plus. It might not be worth the $9.99 price tag, but I'd say it's worth the $3.40 sale price for sure.

												Protogalaxy did not impress me. It's a pretty straightforward arcade game: seperate controls for moving and firing; try to manage both as best as you can while you're being bombarded by up to a dozen enemies at once.The tutorial it thin. But what really put me off is that it's the kind of game where you might play a 5-minute level for 4:30, fail at the end, and then have to start the entire level over. Bleh. The repetition is painful.I do not recommend this game.			",168,51,2,18,21,2,22

												Great concept and its gone free to play WITHOUT in game purchases, so as of now if people complain dont listen to them, what do you expect for a free game, its a top down shooter set in space, it has a great ship upgrade and co-op system with great space mechanics for a top down shooter, however it needs to be develped for mac and the thrusters need to change depending on the way you face.

												I bought this game from the steam store in December 2012.In August 2014 they made it free and took it out of my steam library.This has put an end to my steam game collecting hobby.Someone's thoughtless behaviour has spoiled my fun and I'm not happy.original review:Innovative and fun shoot 'em up.
