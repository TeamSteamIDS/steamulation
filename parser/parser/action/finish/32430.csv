												Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is an action adventure game releasing initially on PS2, PS3, Wii, Xbox360, iOS, Nintendo DS, PSP and who could forget, the N-Gage. The Ultimate Sith edition of the game finally released on PC and Mac OS in November 2009.   The plot in The Forced Unleashed is between the first two trilogies of Star Wars films, but acts as an original story.  You play the role of Darth Vadar’s apprentice, as you are tasked with hunting down Jedi – but you slowly become part of the Light side as things do not go as planned. The game play is very hack and slash style, with the good old classic lightsaber action and with a drop of force action too, the combat is very exciting and pack with all sorts of fancy attacks and duels. Part of your force powers includes the use of electric shocking your enemies too; this can be extremely pleasing to do on large groups of Stormtroopers. The combo system with the lightsabre is easy to get a grip of, and you can soon be showing off some crazy attacks, that look simply awesome.   The game does have quite a lot of QTE’s throughout, these normally occur at the end of a regular fight, allowing a more cinematic dramatic end to a fight, normally I am not a fan of QTEs, but these are done in a way which allow you to enjoy what is happening on the screen whilst also testing your speed and awareness of what is going on.This game is old now, having released almost six years ago, the graphics are becoming to look a bit dated, but that’s not to say it is a bad looking game at all.  It is certainly not up to the standards we are used to now, but if you stick this on 1080p, you can still get some really nice looking scenes. The animation of all the characters are done brilliantly, and all of the levels look fleshed out with some really cool looking backdrops. Plot wise, this has got to be one of my favourite Star Wars games. I really enjoyed playing as the Dark side for once in this type of game, but you can’t stay as the Dark side, as events unfold, you soon start becoming part of the Jedi’s and working to over throw the Emperor.  It will really get you in the mood for watching the film series again. This isn’t a very difficult game; the only times I died were due to errors in the platforming side of the game and I ended up falling off the edge of the world. The difficulty can be ramped up, so playing on hard mode may be the way forward to get more of a challenge. The end boss fights pose a little bit of a challenge, but nothing that you can’t really overcome. I’m looking at you, Star Destroyer boss! Even though the game is very linear, the levels are all of a decent size, and have multiple paths to the end.  With plenty of hidden items for you to collect as you go, you’ll be jumping and fighting your way through plenty of enemies to find them.  I was a little disappointed to see that a couple of the levels were essentially the same map, just done in a different order so to speak, just seemed a little lazy on that part.The game is also on the short side, having completed the game in just less than four hours on a normal difficulty. There is little reason to play it through for a second time unless you are trying the harder modes. I had a couple of technical problems whilst playing. I did go into the game expecting there to be some given the age of the game. The first issue I had was, even when selecting 1080p, the game still doesn’t play in a full screen, you get black bars down the side of your game, which are very annoying. Secondly, the game is capped at 30fps – I can only assume that is because it is a port of the PS3 game. Thirdly, the sound on some levels just cuts out for no apparent reason,  this has been reported as a common bug on the game, and a simple reload will fix it, so just an annoyance really.  I did also encounter a couple of random crashes which resulted in me losing a bit of progress – again I expected these due to the age of the title but would be nice if a patch could be released to fix the problems. To sum up, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a pretty good action game. The game play is really good, and the plot alone all deserves your time and attention. The only thing that really lets it down is the length of the game. I would only say it is worth half of the £14, 99 price tag for that reason alone.  Due to the premium name of the game though it won’t go on sale very often so keep your eyes peeled.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Let's get this out of the way first: this game is an extravagantly unfinished piece of trash. It plays and functions like a very early and rough prototype, levels are spectacularly inconsistent in both length and difficulty, sounds and music many times fail to even load [!], it is locked at 30 fps [!!] (except for a glitch during combos that momentarily unlocks the framerate [!!!]), and textures and segments of levels fail to load at random times [!!!?!] (including during cutscenes when parts of the enviroment simply pop-in after the camera has already panned to it's location). It's undeniable proof of LucasArts's state of total disarray during the generation, and it's ridiculous this game was ever deemed release-worthy. However, I still recommend it....because I had fun with it and liked it. The story is fantastic; containing awesome moments, excellent plot twists, great original characters and deepening existing Star Wars characters. It contains a brand new original score that is wonderful and is up to the quality of John Williams' own work, and the graphics and rendition of the Star Wars universe is breathtaking and exciting once you get past the poor coding and glitches. The DLC for the game (included here) includes an alternative version of the Star Wars trilogy that is also really well done and pure fan service for any Star Wars fan. At the end of the game, I was left wanting for more....which is exactly what I want from any game. Go ahead and play it if you are a Star Wars fan, because you may have a blast.			",68,4,3,7,6,0,8

												So here's the thing, is the game bad? No, far from it. Is it the best Star Wars game out there? No, go play Knights of the Old Republic you fool.The game is based between episodes 3 and 4 of the Star Wars movies. The story, if you pay attention actually is well-explained and well-placed in the 20-ish year gap between the two. It explains how the Rebel Alliance came to be and all that good stuff (if you pay close attention you'll even see where the symbol for the rebels came from), and wraps itself up in the end nicely as well, but this is just story-wise. Are there a few plot holes, probably, but the force is the ultimate way to explain them, right?Anyway the game isn't bad, it takes about 6-8 hours to beat and it is super fun to blast everything to death with Force Lightning. Outside of that, if you are a Star Wars fan, you'll probably like the game, if not, I'd try KotOR first then see how you feel. They aren't the same type of game but if you aren't a Star Wars fan and don't find yourself liking Knights of the Old Republic, then don't bother with this game.One last thing, as a warning, and I will leave this with MINIMUM spoilers. Towards the latter part of the game you end up taking on a Star Destroyer with the force, it took me 3 sequences of manipulating it with the sticks. The third time, it tells you to bring the right stick down and stays red, it is supposed to turn yellowish/green when you are in the correct position (when you get there you'll see what I mean) just keep holding that stick up. It is a bug and I can't believe they didn't fix it, but you'll thank me later when you waste an hour going ""WTF WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO""			",256,38,6,38,20,3,35

												So, back in 1996, George Lucas, creator of Star Wars wanted to know whether the world was ready for more Star Wars. After all, it had been 13 years since the last film had been released. To gauge the public’s opinion, Lucas launched a massive multimedia project quite unlike anything seen before. The entire Lucasfilm marketing engine would produce and publish everything that would tie in with a feature film release, but without actually releasing a film. The result was the Shadows of the Empire chapter. Basically Star Wars 5,5; rich in plot, lore, characters and other elements you’d expect from a Star Wars feature. The project was such a success that it motivated the release of the Special Editions one year later, and finally the prequels. When you consider that project’s success, it isn’t hard to imagine why Lucas would revisit the concept to continue the Star Wars line, even after the release of Revenge of the Sith. Once again, the marketing machine was awoken and the fires of the multimedia forge flared to give shape to: The Force Unleashed The Force Unleashed bridges the gap between episodes three and four. It tells the story of the founding of the Rebellion and the uneasy relationship between the Emperor and Darth Vader. The story is compelling enough to keep you playing. At the same time the game boasts an interesting three-way of physics engines that create a spectacular environment to test your mettle. The package is rounded out with great concepts and art direction, but it is stained with severe cosmetic glitches. The game’s story, and the project’s main plotline follows the exploits of Galen “Starkiller” Marek, who is taken by Vader to be trained in the ways of the Sith after he killed Starkiller’s father himself. Darth Vader raises and trains the boy in secret until he is ready for trials. Vader then sends Starkiller out test his mettle against a number of Jedi who escaped the purge with the ultimate goal of preparing him for a showdown with the Emperor whom Darth Vader seeks to overthrow. The plot ultimately leads to betrayal, rebellion and finally a test of resolve that either leads the universe into the natural course of the larger Star Wars line, or you can derail the entire plot and force the premature end of the rebellion. While strictly linear and with hardly any exploring to do in both gameplay and lore, the game does offer an interesting bridge between the prequels and original trilogy. Both as an explanation for the founding of Rebellion, as well as Vader’s old personality still seeking revenge against the man who turned him a mechanical monster. The newcomer Galen is a rather disappointing affair. He is your typical bald space marine and communicates through whispers and shouting, but no measure in between. He merits more exploration, because the game makes him out to be stronger in the force than any Jedi seen before. The game makes a set piece out of this by having you drag a mile-long, gargantuan, Imperial Star Destroyer out of orbit with the Force just to draw the Emperor’s attention. The story is compelling, and certainly interesting for Star Wars fans, but it also introduces some awkward subjects. Like the robot Proxy, who is programmed to both train and kill Galen, while also appearing at the most impossible locations to provide some gratuitous fan service. Or the character of Juno Eclipse, Galen’s love interest, who seems to be just an accessory. All in all though, the story is interesting and enthralling enough to warrant a good romp. The included DLC chapters play a fun “what-if?” game with the original trilogy events, but they’re short, and unsurprisingly, non-canon*. The Force Unleashed is a technological show stopper with some very clever design, but also riddled with clichéd traits and other gameplay substitutes. It runs a total of three physics engines at the same to time govern a set of parameters. The first engine, Havoc, controls ragdolls and other jiggle bones to give the game its organic aesthetic. Alongside runs Euphoria, the engine that controls the enemy AI to interact with the environment. That way, enemies with grab on to objects to prevent being thrown away with the force. Lastly, the DMM engine governs the world’s materials and their reaction to collision and impacts. Glass shatters realistically when you send a poor sod hurtling through it into deep space. Everything comes together in LucasArts’ own Ronin engine where you basically play like Kratos from God of War, but with significantly more lightning. As Force prodigy, your abilities stretch far beyond your regular Jedi. Force push isn’t just a shove; it’s more like a hadouken. Force lightning now lights up the night sky. You can weaponise the environment by throwing everything and the kitchen sink at you enemies. It is inviting and fun to rip off the walls to toss at your enemies in every new room. However, the multitude options has its limits. A lot of enemies are still dealt with through boring and poorly executed quick-time events. While the physics generally hold up well, they can get buggy at times. It wouldn’t be the first time a boss would sink through the floor after zapping him. Or that the ground suddenly stretches to insane lengths. If you’re entirely unlucky, the game can even give up on you and crash. However, as a PC port, it holds up reasonably well. Don’t expect the illustrious 60fps or 4K resolution. It’s a 2009 game. While its age does show, the art makes up for it. Although not as stylised as Republic Commando or the Clone Wars cartoons, the game does a good job looking like a technically advanced version of the original trilogy. The bedlam around you is well married to the fine-tuned art of the levels and characters. Electricity arcs convincingly, characters recoil and writhe in accordance. Air rushes out of rooms as you break the windows; explosions blow enemies away. Trees move and sway in the wind and shockwaves. Some bosses have seen a very stylish makeover from their film versions. Everything is accentuated with John Williams’ impeccable score to heighten the mood. However, that is where the problems arise. The game shows cracks in the veneer. The music suddenly stops and doesn’t come back on until after a reboot. Or that the sound effects are horribly out of synch with the cut-scenes. Last time, my lightsabre didn’t deactivate during a cut-scene; resulting in a hilarious display of senseless eye-poking. However, it’s such a mess at times you just want to stop playing. In the end though, the game is enjoyable to Star Wars fans. Especially people who got involved during the original era will get a kick out of the focus on the empire over the clones. Interesting characters and satisfying storyline make it worth at least one romp at a good discount. The tech is a thing behold when it doesn’t bug itself out too much. The same goes for the visuals; while a little dated, they use the source material in a dignified and well adapted manner for a more brutal game. This media project paid off my opinion. Give it a go if you like Star Wars.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Forced Unleashed skip to Results and read from there.LucasArts offers a game that brings the force to modern-day systems; although, riddles with pitfalls in the design the Force Unleashed is still a fun and dynamic play-through. Story:You play a young Sith warrior who was taken under Darth Vaders’ wing to become his apprentice. You sole purpose in life is to become a powerful Sith warrior and join Vader to take down the Emperor and control the galaxy. Yet, not everything is how it seems and as you are sent from planet to planet to slay the remaining Jedi a whole new tale unfolds. Campaign:The campaign offers a decent length - depending on how you play it can take anywhere from five (5) to eight (8) hours. The story is divided up into approximately nine missions, which take you through a large variety of different environments. As you progress through the campaign you unlock new force powers, which change how you defeat your enemies. Each level has hidden Holocrons spread throughout it which offer you more experience, skill points, or customizable features. The enemies tend to repeat themselves fairly quickly and the combat dynamics become repetitive, but the bosses offer a nice twist which keeps you wanting more. Each boss fights differently, which causes you to constantly change up your strategy. Gameplay:The main issue with this game is the poor design. Firstly the camera controls are awful, there are more times where you are fighting the camera than fighting enemies. Trying to grab objects with the force can be rather cumbersome and I noticed that I never really grabbed anything because the time it took to get the object to move in the correct direction would cause me to take tremendous damage from surrounding enemies. Another major issue was being pinned by enemies, who would knock you over suddenly turning you into an elderly person who required a warm up before being able to stand up. Hints:>Don’t play on the hardest difficulty (Sith Master) as the bosses scale poorly - the particularly Kazdan Paratus who was damn near impossible to defeat especially when fighting against the poor game mechanics. >Make sure to search the maps for the Holocrons they help you level up much quicker and afford you with more force powers.>Remember to go in and look at your lightsaber, as you play through the campaign you unlock lightsaver powers which help boost your lightsaber. This can be really useful to change based on the mission you are playing. Results:All and all if you’re a Star Wars fan this is a game for you - if not them you probably find the listed cons to ruin the game. I personally like the Star Wars series and found this to be a good addition to the story even though some parts were cheesy. The game offers a decent sized campaign and a relatively fun experience. Pros:+Customized level structure which allows you to choose how you want your character to grow.+Lots of combos, which can make fighting incredibly dynamic.+Control over many aspects of the environment, which you can wield in battle to your advantage.+Awesome boss fights, which force you to change your play style.+Beautiful level design with many different environments.+Nice addition to the Star Wars saga, and great new story elements.+Prologue was just awesome, walking around as Vader and destroying everything.Cons:-Not readily made for Keyboard and Mouse gameplay.-Poor game design – difficult camera control, poor force power control, off targeting system.-Limited to no description of objectives, can leave you standing around wondering what you’re supposed to do. I found myself shocking things with lighting, before realizing I had to grab them or slash it with a lightsaber. -Repetitive enemies, typically finding myself fighting the same thing over and over. This wouldn’t be bad, but some of them were more annoying than difficult to kill.-Limited game customization, there was no ability to control graphics levels. Resolution was controlled before starting the game.			",331,44,5,40,30,0,70

												A few years ago, when I had no gaming PC, I played this on the DS, Wii, and eventually on the Xbox 360. I've enjoyed them because of the unique features that they made for each platform, and I thought they would offer the best experience when they ported it to the PC if you have a good gaming setup. Well, they weren't wrong about that. After playing it at my friend's house, I never expected it to have a lot of bugs, glitches, and crash issues.I gave the game another shot when I saw it on sale, knowing I might experience the same thing. Thankfully, it's more playable than the last time I remembered it...of course with the help of a few tweaks. So far, here are my impressions after fiddling with the it:- Xbox 360 controller option works like a charm.- Keyboard and Mouse controls are a bit clunky, but not that bad at all if bound properly.- You can only adjust the video resolution. Textures and other details of the game are still fixed.- Visuals are good despite of its aging engine (played this on my HDTV).- Loading screens on the options..everywhere.- Camera controls are bad, but bearable.- Force gripping/throwing enemies can be very entertaining.- Boba Fett has a certain bug that makes him invulnerable unless you send him flying with force lightning.- Seeing Ben Kenobi soaring and sliding across the screen after doing force combos is hilarious.- Wampas are fragile creatures.- Still full of bugs and glitches. Sometimes cool, most of the time funny.- Applying the 60fps fix gave me a better experience while learning the lulz of the Force.- I was able to fix my in-game crash issues by turning the cloth physics on and disabling the high details. Additional shadow and texture details were sacrificed in exchange of stability.Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is an old game, and had quite a number of issues on the PC version. But as for me, it's not that bad if you apply the fixes and needed adjustments. It's still a great game and I've personally enjoyed every moment I had with it. Verdict (tl;dr)If you already have Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (including the DLC's) on your PS3 or Xbox 360, feel free to skip this one. As for the fans who bought this game just like me, or who wish to get it while it's on sale, be sure to check the steam community forums. There you will find some guides and links for the fixes you'll need, including the missing sounds and the 60fps unlock. And if you're playing The Force Unleashed for the first time, you won't be disappointed. It has a well-polished storyline that any Star Wars fan would appreciate. Character customization is also a huge addition in this game. And last but not the least, the mix of lightsaber hack n' slash with the Force is fun as hell.			",94,2,0,2,2,0,1

												I am torn with this review. As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I enjoy most good SW story lines and this game has a very nice (cinematic) story line.The graphics are excellent, however the controls, combat and general game play are nothing amazing. Same with the customizations that you can apply to your character, I personally found that they make very little to no difference (except one or two).Difficulty wise its fairly easy and my feeling is that it was intentionally made to not be too challenging so that the story arc flows without long gaps.Would I recommend it ? If you are a fan of Star Wars = absolutely... but view it as an interactive movie/story that you will go through once and never play again. Still, its an enjoyable experience, just keep in mind what it is, so you don't get disappointed after a full playthrough.If nothing else it is quite fun to play such an overwhelmingly powerful character, that can mow down entire armies singlehandedly.On the other hand if you are not a fan of SW... I would probably tell you to stay away, though it will appeal to casual gamers and young children (who are at least mildly familiar with SW).			",605,220,13,72,38,6,107

												This game is fun to play, plain and simple, hack and slash with force powers. My only complaint is the lack of in depth Graphics options to fix the screen tearing. Other than that, it is a great game. It is set between Starwars The Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope during the creation of the rebellion.			",107,22,2,17,6,2,24

												Fun game. Buy it on sale. Completed the campaign in 9 hours.Pros:-Cool combat, most of the time.-Some customization-Graphics, cut scenes, voice acting, all great.Cons:-Towards the end, enemy placement starts to become ridiculous.-lack of meaningful upgrades-Lightsaber upgrades are found by platforming, which feels like a cheap way to extend playability-Sound effects are recycled and feel like they were rushed. -Linear gameplay. The only choice you get to make is the ending, which isn't even clear that it's a choice.-Short campaign-Campaign feels somewhat scattered and abrupt. There are ""plot twists"" that seem to come out of no where or don't make sense.If you're gonna make the campaign only 8-9 hours, then you could at least give us better access to the lightsaber customization. I honestly don't want to spend extra time jumping around just to get more upgrades for what ultimately is a 9 hour game. Give me the best experience in that time frame and be done with it. It would have been great to have access to more MEANINGFUL customization options than empty skins and time-wasting upgrades.			",118,20,2,29,22,2,37

												Yes its a PS3 to PC port; however the ultimate Sith edition has been reworked exclusively for PC, fancier textures, lighting and shaders make this game fairly easy on the eye. The only draw back are the controls on the PC; essentially you will have no problems until late game when you have to do crazy things to star destoryers with your bare hands, then a controller is beneficial unless you want friction burns to meld the mouse to the desk. But if you liked Jedi Outcast or Jedi Academy or Star Wars in general then this game is for you! All the classic force powers, the lightsaber moves, characters and the environments combined with a fairly decent story make it worth picking up if you see it on sale. Just avoid the Force Unleashed 2; a half baked follow up that does the franchise no favours.			",160,6,2,17,23,1,55

												4/10. I do not recommend this game for PC.(Big emphasis on the word here: PC). Please continue reading to find out why, or stop here. Please note and know that I am a huge Star Wars nerd, owning nearly all books, games and movies. I live, sleep and poop Star Wars, so if anyone can look past flaws and still love it for being Star Wars it would be me.Greetings! As some of you saw, Steam had a Star Wars game promotion that included a hefty chunk of some of the Greatest Ever Star Wars games for a very good price, something like 23USD. Without the bundle it was a 160USD so I decided to pop, mainly for Battlefront 2 on PC as I was informed that Online Multiplayer is still functional, so I couldn't resist since BF2 is one of my favorite games of all time. Moving forward, I decided I might as well review some of these Star Wars games that I have played a lot of on the console but never on PC, The Force Unleashed is one of those games. While even on console, reviews were hit and miss. I know that when it first came out, my friends and I were blown away by the graphics and the game mechanic for using the force, which even today is still a fun ability to use. I won't drag this review out and will get to why I can't recommend it and why I encourage you, if you haven't played this great game, to do so and to do it on a XB360 or SonyPS3. This game was made for console through and through. It looks better on console, it plays better on console and has acheivements on console. Not only this but it is 100% locked to using console graphics, even if you try to force better graphics through Nvidia Control Panel. It also does not use my Ram and the Frames Per Second are locked at 30! And lastly, my biggest complaint here is the games audio. The music, sound effects and voice is ported so badly that it almost brings me to tears. At default the music is so faint and the sound effects sound like your a mile away from the action, yet the voices are loud and have a distortion to them. There a many instances where audio is supposed to be played and doesn't from navigating menus to actual NPC voices, at times missing crucial points about the story. I haven't got there yet but I heard there is no audio at all on the last mission, I can't confirm this claim but with the issues I've encountered so far with the audio, it wouldn't surprise me. Let me just give a quick recap here.. -FPS locked @ 30-resolutions also locked -graphics are awful and locked (Can't be changed, even if using Nvidia control panel)-Audio is atrocious and quite broken, even with adjustments, there are huge chunks that are missing from the game. The audio is really the nail in the coffin for this game. -in game captions either spring up too fast or stay around for too long-no acheivements (not a big deal but notable)-requires outdated software to run -doesn't appear to even use Ram (I have 32GB and turned Page Filing off. Page Filing was something done many, many years ago when programs required more ram than the market could provide or for those that couldn't afford more ram. It saves a portion of your HDD or SSD to be used instead.This game runs off that partition which explains a lot, if you have PF disabled it won't run.. )-long loading times and cutscenes (not surprising since this game doesn't use ram)-zero ""safe"" mods to increase replay value or to fix the serious issues it has-more.. just stopping here because its unnecessaryI have played some bad ports from PC to Console and vice versa but this one takes the cake, eats it and sh(ts it out. I could be exaggerating it because I am a passionate Star Wars fan but really, this game on PC is an insult to fans and PC players alike. Save your money and get this on console. You'll have a much better experience overall and you'll get to see why even why this game had some bad reviews, many of us, myself included, still loved it and find it to be one of the best ever made.This game has cons and pros but what makes it a great game for most of us is the story and the lore within the game that your able to unlock as you progress (Data). Most of the information is spot on from the pre-Disney Star Wars universe, which is awesome. Even the way the story unravels, if you've been following along from the films/movies for the era it takes place, is a very real possibility. And its intro is awesome if your a fan of the Empire, giving you a taste of being a incredibly powerful sith lord. I digress. Lets just get to the bottom line here hahaDo not buy this game for PC unless .. You get it for free.. Buy it for less than 3-4 USD.. Your the biggest fan of TFU and can look past a book worth of flaws that are only found on PC.. Or desperately want a game with 360/XB1 controller functionality for PC/SteamLink and don't care what it is or how it plays..  Whoever decided to throw this at PC obviously did not care about the PC fanbase but instead wanted to cash in on PC Star Wars fans. It upsets me that this game is in this condition on PC as well as the price it cost when not on sale, its ridiculous and my only hope is that someone figures out how to mod it or that they consider remastering it, giving it the proper port it deserves. This is sacrilege!			",57,3,1,1,3,0,5

												There aren't many Star Wars games. Most of them are good. Some are legendary. This one is a gem for a Star Wars game  and a fun time for every other kind of gamer. It's one of the best SW games and makes it stand is the fact that it runs even on the newest system. Have you ever wanted to be someone who unleashes his power, being devasting from the start, and being unstoppable in the end? If you like the ideea, then you should buy this game, because this ideea is executed well. In the SW universe, you get to play as Darth Vader(only in the prologue) and Starkiller(one of the most powerful Force-users ever). The latter seeks to find his place in the galaxy hoping to find himself. It's a quest that involves a best friend droid, a gorgeous pilot, a mysterious past and a double betrayal. In the end, you get to shape your destiny, being able to chose between a light side and dark side ending. The former option will end up in the birth of the Rebellion.Gameplay wise, you'll have fun using your power, such as pushing enemies in oblivion, getting lightning bolts everywhere, repulsing everything that's nearby, throwing your lightsaber, gripping all kinds of thins to turn them into all kinds of projectiles and covering yourself in lightinining for your own good. The thing that may ruin the fun is the targetting system which sometimes can make you consume force energy for nothing. Graphics have aged pretty well, since the art style is strong. The numerous skins can make things look a lot more interestings.All in all, it's a great game, it's only drawback is being short, but it's worth your money. Cleaning the floor with Sith Lords never gets old. [8.5/10]			",318,41,7,39,16,2,26

												I beat the game again for nostalgia, and I have come to realize it isn't as nearly as good as a game as I remembered.There are some things going for it.  You are a sith that helps jedis, which is cool.  It's a hack n slash in the star wars universe, which is cool.  Some of the action sequences and cut scenes are pretty cool.  But there are A LOT of problems, and quite frankly, they put minimal QA into this game.First I want to start with environment.  It's wonky, to best describe it.  He can't run up some hills, you have to double jump it.  Some ledges you just run over, and it isn't realistic, while other ledges is just the right height so you have to jump.  It's quite frustrating.  Sometimes you just slide off, which is very frustrating.  Some times, like in one of the last boss fights, I've gotten stuck somewhere and I have to wait to get hit to get unstuck.  It is just stuff like that that they needed to polish out with QA, but they probably had a limited budget.There is skilled jumping in this game.  What I mean by that is there is very seldom platforms set up for you to just jump, or just double jump.  You have to gauge it.  I don't mind it, but it did make me frustrated.The combo system.  It had such good potential to have a great hack n slash, the problem is, you don't really need it.  Not only that, you can never pull off the advanced combos.  Either they die too quickly, or they just absorb damage and knock you out of the way or something.  It's like the enemy doesn't respond to your damage, and sometimes they do, and when they do, they die with the basic combo.  There are a few combos that you have to have, and I think that's why they brough this system in.  But the rest of the combos that you unlock, are only there to consume a combo point when you lvl up.  That's my theory.  They were never really designed to be used in the game.When Starkiller get knocked back, or receives damage, it's like it takes him 2 years to get up.  And then damage is pounded onto you, and I think that is the intention of it, because they couldn't come up with a game where Starkiller gets damage.  It is quite frustrating.One last thing then I am done.  You can't dash or block in mid combo.  WTF!  I don't think you realize how maddening that is if I could of disrupted my lightsaber attack with a block, or a dash.In the end, the only real reason why I would play the second one is the story, that's it.  Which I probably will beat.  I've beaten these games before, but I remembered them to be much better.  In the end, more problems than benefits.  Thumb down.			",117,5,0,18,1,0,13

												Titanic21´s 21st review!I know, I know. The consol version is better. And I can totally agree with that. I remember those times I battled my friend on his Nintendo Wii in two player mode, I completed this game two times or more, I tried to collect all Lightsaber-Chrystals (and failed), I enjoyed the graphics as much as I could and I remember any of those missions. Oh, good old times... And so I bought this on Steam.""Wait... Two player mode? Where are you? Nowhere, but that´s okay, how should that even be possible, two players playing on the same keyboard simultanously... (...) Just gonna jump right into! Mh, the Menu looked better then... I don´t care. (...)  Okay, there we go. Mh, controlling Lightsaber with mouse, didn´t expect anything else. Unfortunately I can´t set the direction of my cuts this way, but that´ll be allright. Yes, killing Wookies using force is still as fun as I remember. (...) Oh, what´s that? A holocron? No, it´s a chrystal to transform you Lightsaber´s color with! In the shape of a holocron... No, I am sure there where animations for that on the Wii version... So now I should be able to go back to the Rogue Shadow to get my new, better Lightsaber... What´s that? No Rogue Shadow? Sad, sad... Well, let´s move on, I gotta finish this! (...) So, done here... That was shorter than i thought... It took me longer on Wii, I am sure. Is it the difficulty? Oh wait, they actually took out some story... probably that´s for saving memory, I get along with that. (...) No, I am not disappointed, of course! It was still fun to play and I don´t think this is overpriced, as they say. (...)""If you didn´t get it, here´s what I want to tell you:The reason why the reviews are so different is, that a lot of people bought this after they had played the console version. and yeah, I do agree, it´s way better. But although the PC-Version is so weak and has a lack of content, compared to the one for other systems, what we´ve got here is still one of the best, if not THE best game from the ""Star Wars"" franchise in existence. So in my opinion this is worth it´s money, but getting this in a sale is better, of course. If you have access to the console version, play it instead. If you don´t, get the Steam version. I have to admit that if I hadn´t ever played this on Wii, I wouldn´t ever understand the ammount of negativ reviews. I know this review doesn´t discribe the game itself, but I hope it will help you making your choice instead, for the case the mixed reviews make you doubt. As usual, I can´t promise that you´ll like the game, this is only my opinion.Thanks for reading and have a nice day then ;)			",66,20,1,1,5,0,6

												Other than being an obvious port of a console game and having a few dumb boss fights, overall I think this game is a lot more fun than most reviewers gave it credit for.  If you like slicing things up with lightsabers and shooting out force lightning (and let's be honest, who doesn't?), this game is about as good as you'll get until we get a proper sequel to Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast.  It does a good job of making you really feel like the overpowered badass of a Sith that you are.			",128,3,1,14,2,0,23

												The community is hard as hell on this game. I'm not really a starwars fan (more of a star trek fan) so i could give 2 sqates for the story. I am on the other hand a big beat em up fan, so im easily pleased if certain criteria that i believe is common in the beat-em up genre is met.   I'll honestly say this game feels slow as♥♥♥♥♥♥locked at 30fps, to a point where it virtually feels a bit unplayable and more of a chore just playing it. One of my main reasons for not continuing to play the game was because of how slow it felt. till someone told me i could fully unlocked the game and get 60fpsAfter doing so man how this game felt so much improved. At heart one can clearly see this game was a rip straight off of the consoles. I'll be quick to say the menus are downright dated to the point of disgust. Menus surly doesn't scale to resolutions, thats for sure. game is worth it, as long as you can deal with the small janks.			",1252,355,43,130,109,15,147

												SWTFU and no that's not STFU carries the Star Wars moniker well though the gameplay is somewhat deficient including one sequence involving incorrect on screen prompts critical for mission success and a copious amount of QTE's, though I'll admit they were entertaining and easy to execute making for splendid theatre. The game is followed by three vignette like story containers. Numbers 2 and 3 are surprisingly good and the story elements are there as pillars to support the since accomplished primary game. The pièce de résistance of the Ultimate SIth Edition are the multitudinous Star Wars personalities, many of which you as the protagonist will go mano-a-mano with and which permeate the story throughout the primary game and the subsequent vignettes and all of which have quality visual and auditory presentations. The emotional specturm while playing dimensions from wtf are you serious to bravo, can I get a curtain call. Despite the numerous setbacks, SWTFU proves the old adage, the show must go on and in the end entertainment conquers execution.			",2426,1048,114,292,316,28,430

Story: Star Wars: The Force Unleashed tells the story of Darth Vader's secret apprentice called Starkiller. The storyline plays between Episode III and Episode IV and is about the establishment of the Rebel Alliance. Graphics: Despite the fact that the game was released in 2008, the graphics still look quite handsome. A few textures are still striking, but it does not affect the whole game. Gameplay: Throughout the game, you can complete several levels of the Star Wars Saga. Including Raxus Prime, Nar Shaddaa and Felucia.Language: The language output is completely in english, and sounds excellent - Especially the voices of Starkiller and Darth Vader.Conclusion: The Force Unleashed is one of the best Star Wars games made by LucasArts, and you can tell it anyone who is fan oft he movies or series. Only the rarely „performance breaks“ are disturbing.http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CanisMajorisReviews ",87,11,1,7,10,3,0

												I don't know why this game is hated so much. It's AMAZING!!! Great story, good gameplay, interesting characters, and varied locations are just some of the things that will give you nostalgia as you learn not only the backstory (like the prequels did) but also the ins and outs of the Empire. Acting as Darth Vader's secret apprentice you have a sandbox to use as a playground for all of your force abilities, from lightning to force pushing. Some puzzles will appear from time to time, but nothing feels out of place. If you like star wars, buy this. You won't regret it.			",28,4,0,1,3,0,0

												Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is an action-adventure, hack'n'slash roller coaster of Sith Awesome Sauce. You play as Starkiller, the 'secret apprentice' of Darth Vader. Though you are initially tasked with hunting down Jedi Survivors, your quest quickly changes after you make some friends, enemies, and are put through extreme measures. It is honestly one of the best stories featured in a Star Wars game, and the story accounts for so much of the momentum while playing (I should note that as with all other star wars games, the story is considered non-canon in the universe, which I personally don't mind). The gameplay is a bit cumbersome at first, but once you've gotten used to it, the lightsaber and force combat is extremely addicting and fun. After sometime, you'll start making heavy use of combos, combining force lightning with lightsaber attacks, or force push with force dash, etc. There's tons of combos to be pulled off, all visually satisfying and very useful when taking down enemies. The AI is overall intelligent, apart from some enemy types with very basic reactions to the player, but that's easily excused by the wide variety of enemy types. The game spans 10 levels, taking about 45 Minutes (give or take) for each, so the game ends up being really short. Each level is filled with hidden Holocrons, giving timed buffs or unlockables, such as lightsaber crystals or upgrade points. A boss battle usually concludes each level, mostly being unique and very challenging. You'll face down Rancors, Sith Assassins, Imperial Walkers, the list goes on. It always gives you something to look forward to at the end. It's worth mentioning that this is definitely a console port, as the framerate is locked and there's little to no optimization settings or menus. The game overall looks and runs decent, apart from sound issues on very rare occassion. If you play on a potato, I'm sure you'll be fine. Overall, The Force Unleashed is a worthy game for any Star Wars fan, and double for a fan of Sith characters. The Ultimate Sith Edition just adds 3 bonus levels as an epilogue to the game's alternate ending, but they're nice additions. Despite being incredibly short, the game offers a lot of replay value with the combat system, collectibles, and harder difficulties.7/10 - Great Deal if discounted (which happens very rarely for this title apparently, so your money, your problem. gg no refunds)			",101,7,0,13,2,0,1

												Some might argue against any sort of recomendation, but i found this game very enjoyable because it gave you nearly full control over your force powers, which many starwars games often restrict. I will say that one argravating bit was that the saves are based off of checkpoints rather than saving after conflicts. This means you can blow through a battle only to fall off a cliff because of a bad jump and have to do it all over again. I was not expecting the bend physics, but they impressed me and the only criticism i have is that they are a bit weak when interacting with stuff. Otherwise i almost hope that a movie be considered for this game because it has a legitimate story that shines light in an area that we dont see in the star wars movies. also the new movies havent nessesarily disproven or denied the lore elements.

												Ever dreamed of becoming a wielder of the Force? Well here is practically a simulation as a master of the Dark Side of the Force. You play as Darth Vader's apprentice, Galen Marek as you trawl through the galaxy as you blast your enemies away with varieties of different powers and complex light-saber combos. The levels are lengthy and well designed with unique atmospheres and terrains that guarantee exciting game-play. No matter what challenge you face you are almost always able to get take care of the depending on how you level up your powers, combos, and talents. While not a perfect game (levels can sometimes get stale and repetitious, enemies can be rather uninspired), Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a fun pick-up-and-play type of game.			",94,9,0,8,4,0,3

												A bad port of a good game.Takes almost 30GB of your storage, lacks any kinds of graphical options besides resolution, brightness and ""High Detail: on/off"", and has some weird glitches. Most notably, the 'hall of mirrors' effect that takes the skybox's place with some video cards, something to do with the tiny draw distance. If you own an Intel card, you'll have to ignore this, as there is no solution at all. It is still playable, though.Past this huge bummer, look for fixes for the static clothes (which should be affected by physics and flow around as you move) and the missing sounds on the last two levels.If you have a better card and lots of spare storage, you should give this a try.Although the plot and the characters are quite uninteresting, the simple Devil May Cry-like hack'n'slash gameplay is pretty fun.

												NOTE: I first reviewed the PS3 version of TFU back in 2011, but my opinion of it has not changed since then. Below is an edited/shortened version of that same text. Key difference is that the Ultimate Sith Edition is a better deal with some awesome DLC missions. Game is locked to 30 fps, but there is an easy workaround available for this online.The first elements of this game that shine are the story and characters. I was hooked into the plot and interested to see how the tale would unfold as I progressed further through its layers, each backed up with the same strong narrative. The game takes place between Star Wars Episode III and Episode IV. The Republic has been disbanded and the first Galactic Empire is born. Success is gained by the two rulers of the Imperium (Darth Sidious with Darth Vader, his apprentice) through means of betrayal, anger, terror and murder.Yet there is one thing that Lord Vader has kept secret from the sovereign Emperor… his own acolyte, Galen Marek – dubbed Starkiller. Trained in the ancient ways of the Sith, he is tasked with destroying the remaining Jedi Knights – once the keepers of peace in the galaxy, but branded traitors as soon as Darth Sidious’ plan came into motion. A larger plot forms behind Starkiller’s back, which soon causes him to question the morals and motives of his actions. Once you reach the very end of the story, you will be given a choice to make which will affect the overall outcome of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed.The whole plot is good, but what this story is really fuelled by are fantastic characters. The protagonist himself is unusual. You would probably expect a badass, quiet, ready to sacrifice everything for his goal type of guy. Sure, Starkiller comes close to that sometimes, though most of the time he is more unique than most stereotypical protagonists. Juno Eclipse – the secret apprentice’s female pilot – is another great character that (not unlike Starkiller) is voiced by someone who knows how to express feelings and change words written on paper into something special, creating interesting spoken conversations between characters.Using various force powers to attack enemies is a blast. You really do feel like you have unleashed Starkiller’s true power by electrocuting hostiles with Force Lightning, hurling them far away using Force Push, picking up objects and enemies from a distance (using the Force) and throwing them all around and more entertaining powers. For each mission in the game there is a bonus objective and a number of Jedi Holocrons to find, plus a specific amount of Force Points to gain. The latter are generated by defeating enemies using various combos, each made up of a mix of lightsaber slashes and Force powers. The more moves you put into one combo – the more points you will gain. Larger enemies or boss fights can also give greater rewards. If you accumulate enough points, Starkiller will level up, thus getting a force combo sphere, a force sphere and a talent sphere. These can then be spent on upgrades that make Galen even more powerful.These spheres can also be obtained through other means than just levelling-up. The aforementioned Jedi Holocrons are large, cube-shaped objects teeming with a yellow glow. They are used to store data from the Jedi Archives. In TFU, these Holocrons are hidden in nooks of each level area. They contain spheres, as well as other goodies like free force points, lightsaber power crystals (these can upgrade Starkiller’s lightsaber to deal more damage, drain health from enemies with each attack, and so on) or lightsaber colour crystals to change the colour of the blade. One feature that unlocks as you progress through the game are costumes for Starkiller to wear. Each mission gives you a new outfit that is the most suitable for the environmental hazards of the particular planet you visit. These costumes can be changed at any time through the pause menu.Unfortunately all of this comes at a price. Although the combat and gameplay in general, including the occasional platforming sequences required to get from one place to another, work well and blend almost seamlessly to create something that flows smoothly right from the beginning to the end of the game – there is one major flaw… targeting. When using Force powers, you need to face the target you want to attack so that it is selected. However this system doesn’t target the enemies that the camera is facing, but those that Starkiller is facing. So when there is an enemy right in front of you but Starkiller is looking in another way, the Force power will not be applied to the enemy but in the direction that the apprentice is currently facing. This weird design choice is a nuisance for most of the game because you simply won’t be able to attack specific enemies using powers unless you make sure that Starkiller is always facing them. Thankfully lightsaber combat doesn’t have this problem as it is mostly melee and doesn’t require any targeting; nevertheless, this targeting issue is serious enough to bring Force Unleashed down quite a bit.Even though TFU was originally released in 2008, it still manages to look good when compared even to some newer titles. It certainly isn’t perfect as there is plenty of graphical hiccups to be found, however minor, they are still here even after patching. Regardless, the artistic direction LucasArts went for when planning each planet is impressive. Though the level design isn’t as remarkable and can sometimes be slightly repetitive, all planets still manage to look unique and inviting. Whether it is the varying colour scheme, architecture, plant life or the species that inhabit them – they almost never cease to surprise. There’s nothing here as amazing as you’d expect from a game like BioShock, but it is very good nonetheless and deserves merit.The best visual element of the graphics in TFU must be the character design, especially the facial expressions of the human protagonists. Look closely at Starkiller’s face and you will see such detail and realism. Each move of the muscles on his face only improves the way the character’s emotions and speech are expressed. Juno Eclipse follows closely behind, however sometimes her face does look strange – though nonetheless very realistic. Or perhaps Darth Sidious’ striking resemblance to his movie counterpart in the prequel trilogy? Though all characters look great, Starkiller steals the show as also one of the more interesting gaming heroes of 2008.On top of that we have a nice physics engine and situational enemy behaviour; you might destroy a glass wall and watch as it brakes realistically, then strike another glass structure to realise that each time it will never look the same as the event occurs in real-time; lift a Stormtrooper up into the air using the Force and watch him desperately try to grab onto anything to stay near the ground; push an enemy off a surface, then notice that he is still clinging onto the ledge but is slowly slipping, etc. These events (as mentioned before) are not scripted animations and will look different each time. However, some of these effects can end up being a little buggy and rarely work exactly as the developers intended them to, so they could have been implemented with more care.It may not have received such praise from critics as it did from me, but simply judging by how much fun I’ve had playing TFU I am happy to say that this positive rating is well-deserved. Most SW fans should enjoy this game. If you are not that much interested in the saga or are looking to extend your knowledge about it, TFU should satisfy your needs; its gameplay offers plenty of fun and occasional frustration. Unless you hate Star Wars that is, then I doubt that this game will be able to change your mind. But if you feel like you are ready to finally unleash the Force (with some flaws along the way), then I assure you that TFU is a must-play.			",85,5,0,7,4,1,14

												Before we start this review, we need to get one thing straight: under no circumstance do I recommend that you purchase this game while it's at full price ($19.99). While it's on sale? Sure. Right now? Please don't.At it's core, The Force Unleashed is just another linear hack-n-slash with little to no story depth and an unusually short campaign, however, that doesn't keep the game from being entertaining in it's own right. The story is full of clichés, and it's difficult to relate to the main character. The soundtrack is an amalgamation of musical scores from the original Star Wars saga and original compositions from Mark Griskey and Jesse Harlin. My main gripe with the soundtrack is that although it's great, there's little to no variation in it. There are only 4-5 songs that'll play during combat throughout the entire campaign, and it's easily noticeable. The gameplay isn't varied either; different Force powers become available to you as you progress through the storyline, and you'll find yourself spamming the same combos on the same enemies time and time again. Boss fights are deceivingly simple, with no more than three progressions in strategy throughout each bout. It might be fun as hell, but it gets stale after some time. Onto the most pressing issue: the port from consoles to PC. This is a mediocre port at best. There are performance inconsistencies across Windows versions. The SFX (such as foley) and music cuts out completely in some levels, and the game requires a reset for it to cut back on. The game crashes at random with a surprising frequency. There are graphical errors. The list goes on. The replay value is nil; the game does in fact have two different endings, but both of them are equally dissatisfying. All three DLC packages are less than 45 minutes long, and are unbelievably bland.The graphics were quite impressive at the time of the game's release, and it's overall aged quite well, although it may look a bit dated to some people.Overall, I'd give the game a solid 7.5/10.

												I always loved playing this game - the action is fun, the story (although no-longer canon) is great, and the performances, particularly of the main character are fantastic. But the PC port starkly displays the unintuitive design choices and technical shortcomings of the game. The character models are alright, but the environmental textures look terrible, and the loading screens in between menus are unforgivably annoying.Other than that though, the game IS fun to play on PC, finding the upgrade holocrons is enjoyable, the music is (of course) fantastic, the keyboard controls work surprisingly well, and the sheer amount of destruction you can cause with you force powers is excellent! It's not a ground-breaking game by any standards, but it is a fun hack-and-slasher with a great story. It's just a shame that the utter lack of effort put into porting the game - right down to the lack of graphics options, or even an in-game keyboard controls menu - makes it a sometimes-bumpy ride. Get it cheap.			",286,54,2,37,37,0,28

												The game play is very hack and slash style, with the good old classic lightsaber action and with a drop of force action too, the combat is very exciting and pack with all sorts of fancy attacks and duels. Part of your force powers includes the use of electric shocking your enemies too; this can be extremely pleasing to do on large groups of Stormtroopers. The combo system with the lightsabre is easy to get a grip of, and you can soon be showing off some crazy attacks, that look simply awesome. The game does have quite a lot of QTE’s throughout, these normally occur at the end of a regular fight, allowing a more cinematic dramatic end to a fight, normally I am not a fan of QTEs, but these are done in a way which allow you to enjoy what is happening on the screen whilst also testing your speed and awareness of what is going on.The game its old but its nice and of course im a Star Wars fan so i recomend to all my friends :D			",290,53,15,17,14,6,12

												This game's ""big"" feature is supposed to be the Force controls, but from the very beginning, where you play as Darth Vader moving at the dignified speed of a glacier, it feels messy and unpredictable.  Picking up objects with the Force is a guessing game that feels like you're blindly stirring spaghetti with a shovel.  Sometimes I kill enemies by accident and sometimes I'm tearing my hair out.The developers put a lot of time into giving you different combat options, but I can't justify using the full breadth of the library.  90% of them are too conditional or too difficult to remember.  The remaining are cheap tricks that have a high success rate and easy on the mana pool.  If you run too low, there are plenty of areas to hide and recharge.  Not that you can play this as a stealth game (which might have been cooler), but the baddies are pretty dumb and can't be bothered to seek you out.The whole concept of The Force Unleashed is that this is the Star Wars you already knew, but all the stops have been pulled out.  This works in the art direction because the world feels threatening and extravagant, but the music is the same old fasioned Williams-esque riffs that we have shoehorned into virtually every Star Wars product.  And the story is pretty basic.  I don't really care about the protagonist that much, but to be fair, I don't know of too many games where I ever actually do.Most importantly, the actual gaminess of the game isn't very well realized.  I don't think the Force ever *was* unleashed.  Combat feels half-baked and sloppy.  The levels aren't designed to have players moving around in them and doing awesome Jedi things.  This is what games are built out of.  You do things in places.  And though the places have neat things in them, the way you interact with them is clunky and unrefined.I'm surprised I went in as far as I did, and I think I liked the world of TFU more than I did slogging through it.  There's a real inspiration to its art direction that, had it carried across to the other departments, might have provided for a really interesting game.			",159,52,0,21,16,0,23

												Basically a good star wars game with nice lightsaber gameplay and an interesting story for star wars fans.I played both the Playstation 2 and the XBox360 Version of this game and absolutly loved it.The mistake I made was since my PS2 doesn´t work anymore and i dont own a 360(played it at a friend), i bought the pc version.So coming to the problems of the PC Version:-horrible performance and no graphic options/30 FPS cap-Sound problems/stuttering,changing volume for no apparent reason-nearly unplayable with keyboard and mouse/ works fine with an XBox360 controller for PC-very long loading times( i mean,30 sec. just for changing a costume?)So,if you have an XBox360 or Playstation 3, buy it for consoleIf it´s on sale and you own an Controller for PC, i think it may be worth for a little price.

												Got this as part of a bundle, because I really liked the way the series that started with Dark Forces had developed.Had a hard time getting into it at first, until I realized this time around it was a console port, and what they were trying to do with the control scheme.  If you play it, and have access to a USB controller, I'd highly recommend using it.  There's one section towards the end that's nigh on impossible to do with keyboard and mouse, unless you check the forums and realize that the port is treating the mouse input as analog instead of digital.Graphics are nice, gamplay narrative flows well, and you get some decent character developement from the protagonist.Mouse/keyboard controls are a bit clunky for pumping out those lightsbaer/force combos, but it the end it almost recaptured that Jedi Academy feel for me, with a nice storyline bridging Ep II and Ep IV of the movies.If you're a fan of the series, I'd recommend buying it on sale, and keep the controller recommendation in mind.

												the most important part to enjoying this game is the spectacle. there are scores of games that do this better. don’t expect dynasty warriors or even the god of war it rips off. it’s painfully paint-by-numbers with an ignorant combat system that discourages melee and has no difference in combo versatility other than length. what creates the spectacle is, after all, the ranged combat. starkiller dumps lightning from his fingers and has better hadokens than any street fighter. all you gotta do is blast the rag dolls away with your midichlorian powers. if being a magical laser deathmachine isn’t on your list of ‘entertaining spectacles’ then you’re going to take issue with this game. that’s not to say there are no redeeming qualities - there absolutely are - but its success hinges so much on enjoying being a destructive brutish jedi.you have a four string combo and that’s pretty much it. it can be delayed to get more hits in but since enemies have armor values it ends up doing less damage, which is a pretty amazing oversight. at any point of your combo you can opt for a finisher, either lightning style or spirit gun. lightning knocks bads down and blasts knock them away. finishing the tail end of your combo with force will instead knock an enemy up, symmetry be damned, leading into a second air combo. if you were to play to efficiently, you'd do this to every enemy, and end with a throw. it does overwhelmly more damage than any other string, though playing like that would become mind-numbing. I ended up using different finishers arbitrarily, pretending like the invincibility frames from grabbing were needed, the aoe of the lightning swipe was tactical, and that blasting the enemies away secured my safety. the depth could be there, but it’s rendered brainless by design flaws.I’m torn over which is the worst offender, so I’ll relate linearly. force unleashed’s cardinal sin is having a level up system. whatever depth we can allow the game doesn’t matter; it’s locked out to you. it’s not even as if there’s a gradual curve compensating for your progression like a rpg, enemies from the second mission forward get no bulkier, which isn’t something I wanted mind you. it does take considerably less points to acquire every combo, though maybe it was simple luck that allowed me to have them all before the end, because of another beautiful offender: level ups are also tied to hidden collectibles. if you’re a sleuth hound (or play with a guide) you’ll have a nonsensical advantage over the player whose focus is on combating the level. I’m not against progression in a beat ‘em up, but if the progression overrides basic skill and locks out mechanics that should be in the game to begin with then it’s served no purpose.its next big ticket in wasted design is very poor enemy philosophy. arrangement of enemies is not all important in a beat ‘em up. some games do this very well, others do not realize there is a purpose to it. both approaches honestly serve just as well and the force unleashed is not without finesse. sometimes it crafts thoughtful encounters. now I’m not so concerned about its technical design, because its ruined from the gate. difficulty is supplanted by giving enemies specific immunities to your jedi magic. the force powers are the most fun part of the game, so this is lamentable, but respectable considering their overpowered nature. however, they couple such immunities with enemies that are immune to knockdowns and hitstun. it’s absolutely stupid for a beat ‘em up to have enemies with constant super armor, because it downplays what should be the focus of the game, its close combat action. on top of diluting its focus, it shuts down a half of your ranged attacked, hampered further by the fact that you might have spent all of your levels on your favorite force powers. you have to grind out high hp enemies using attacks that you don’t favor. there are all kinds of solutions, like putting a window of vulnerability after the enemies attack string, or a successful finisher staggering the enemy. on that note, mechanical enemies weak to electric always stagger to sith attacks and are immune to force. which means the best way to dispatch is repeating the same three hit electric combo. absolutely monotonous.note that despite these flaws, unleashed is still satisfying to play visually, and is not broken, just a far cry of being sophisticated. starkiller moves quick and is carefully animated. hit detection feels great, favoring you instead of enemies, though sometimes the priority seems wrong. the ragdoll physics are absurd but I wouldn’t want it any other way. my spirit palm should send every idiot flying. rooms are continually different, I was more than surprised, and enjoyed the level design more than anything else in the game. if two missions (that’s like a fourth of the game) didn’t take place on the exact same planets as the first two missions, and if the final level didn’t feel so rushed, I would be singing fat praises. as it stands, though, two levels are remixed environments. they’re still a lot different from the source they reuse, but without the different enemy models and textures the game had been throwing at you up to this point it loses a ton of its momentum. at least starkiller’s fashion always changes between levels, something I still can’t get over.graphically the game is great, high-budget values everywhere. I’m probably ignorant of games from 2008 but damn it looks good. nice and shiny with an art direction that’s definitely star wars. I don’t remember if it’s the first or second time you go to raxus prime, that’s the stupid game’s fault, but there’s a part where you’re in a huge mushroom-thing with interconnected bridges sprawling upward. it’s like something pulled out of nintendo’s playbook. there’s a lot of detail on the planets and in the space ships. this stems from a desire of having all kinds of things to throw at badguys, even when it stops being useful, the clutter is less than clutter and is real organic. this degree of detail that will probably go unnoticed, simply because the gameplay is no where near as detailed. even better than the graphics is the game’s music. it’s probably star wars standard to have rearranged star wars tunes for their games, but holy crap is this some top shelf classical. makes all kinds of modern games sound like a joke.now the story is nothing more than a saturday morning cartoon. it doesn’t feel stupid or contrived, but it seems more motivated to get starkiller to fight certain things than to orchestrate his apprenticeship. I found the voice acting awesome and able to carry the whole game and darth vader to be absolutely convincing, sealing the simplistic premise to something I could wholly enjoy. the only thing that would make darth vader cooler is if he was an exiled prince of zeon. it’s not incredibly in-depth, but you know, neither is the phantom menace. it has some hard hitting moments and the writing is pretty serviceable. frankly it’s not the best or the worst, so take it as is and have a ball. the dlc levels are slipshod compared to the main game, I’m not going to grace them with my words, but I’d like to shout out the hoth campaign where starkiller gets luke to turn to the dark side and make luke his apprentice. that’s freakin cool.so yeah, this is just a spectacle brawler. it has great levels and great theming, but doesn’t quite sink in the gameplay. it isn’t mangacore either, so its missing its targert market, heh. if you’re down to shoot thunder and lighting, to bend spines with your fingers, to cut puppety flesh like cheese with a glowstick, and fly around inside a neutered space opera, then the force unleashed is a successful game. those are all things I wanted to do, I just didn’t know I wanted to do them			",551,195,11,88,31,4,86

												i have always wanted to see a star wars film set between revenge of the sith and the original (which doesnt seem to be happening since we are getting sequels to return of the jedi!) but there is game that covers this part of the franchise, the storyline of this game does the franchise justice, you can do missions on planets from the films and a new planet (which i hated) that you do two missions on and unlike it's sequel the quick time events do not make me want to tear my hair out, you can choose 2 endings one of which will connect the story to the film and the other alters the story and the dlc missions are based upon this ending, The sith master difficulty is INSANELY hard  and is alot harder than the difficulty of the sequel, the one negative i can think of right now is that scene where you must pull down a STAR DESTROYER with the force (it is so annoying!!!) the game is short/medium. I rate this game 8/10 i would rate it 9/10 if the story was longer.			",95,3,0,3,2,0,2

												I played this years ago on the Wii.  The PC version is based on the PS3/X360 version.  Of course, the Wii version had lesser graphics, but there were also quite a few difference in the levels, due to being a less powerful console and using the Wiimote.  So, I always wanted to to play it on PC, and I finally got around to it.  The Sith Edition adds three new levels to play outside of the main story.Overall, I like this game and had a lot of fun playing it. Graphics are good, although not the best I've ever seen last gen.  There aren't a lot of settings in the game, but you can turn on anti-aliasing and other features in your video card settings to improve the looks.The game is not without its faults. I had a lot of trouble with the targeting system.  There is a targeting button that helps in some cases, but it doesn't solve the problem completely.  Many times I died were due to targeting.  That's not to say the controls are bad. The controls are pretty good for the most part.  YMMV.  I also found that some sounds were missing in the last two levels. If you run into this problem, search the Steam forums for a fix.  The real highlights are the story, characters, voice acting, and production values.  This could easily fit as the true ""canon"" between Episodes III and IV.  It gets thumbs up from me.			",152,42,3,18,4,3,31

												The game is pretty good. Decent story. But were it really shines is combat and movement. It has revolutionary combat which utilizes corners and walls like never before. Let me elaborate. so say you're fighting a boss and he has his ""special ragdolling super-move."" the dude gets close to you and you're now trapped between ragdoll god and a wall. he's ragdolling you constantly, you can't get up. What do you do? hope to god you can un-ragdolls for the 0.03 seconds it takes to jump out of there. This only happens about 20% of the time If you have good reflexes (or mash spacebar uncontrollably). Never before have I seen the environment integrated into immersive combat so effectively. The second great aspect is the movement, or more specifically the fact it doubles as a surfing simulator. Sometimes you might get in a battle that killed you 6 times and took an hour and a half to complete. You've finally done it and you walk a meter away from the intended path and BOOM. you've found a sufable corner. The surfing animation is without a doubt one of the best I have seen in a game to date. the only downside is that usually after about 10 seconds, the physics engine decides you've been surfing on the spot for so long you're probably at like 200 kph by now so it rockets you outward into the firey abyss of doom (or some other abyss of doom.) Fortunatly because of the amazing checkpoint system, you now get to fight ragdoll-god once again and continue trying hopelessly to escape that corner while getting ragdolled for another good portion of your life.So, is the game good you ask?YES! You should certainly get this game.11/10 would ragdoll for 17 minutes straight again.			",51,3,0,9,3,0,1

												Fun but some levels are hard. Like when you have to pull down the star destroyer because waves and waves of tie fighters keep coming and the star destroyer goes back to the original position.  But it is pretty easy after that and entertaining.			",5,0,0,0,2,0,1

												An under-rated game. Ignoring the issues with the PC version, which were fixed easily in my situation (within a few hours), the game's physic engine is entertaining, even after 9 years of innovation in game engines. The graphics also serve their purpose well after so many years. I believe the story is what shines the most, much like other Star Wars media. Although clearly far fetched regarding Starkiller's force abilites, the relationship between Vader and Starkiller, as well as between Starkiller and Juno drive most of the plot events. Unlike the sequel, this works well and is believable.			",72,10,1,9,6,0,4

												Not bad-  Definitely not canon as far as Star Wars, but even before Disney bought Lucasfilm i don't think this was canon.  Controls are a little wonky, and there's only about 8 hours of story play-  The few bonus missions are kind of cool in this addition.This is a nice one if you just want to hack and slash your way through a bunch of enemies.  Picking up a stormtrooper with the force and flinging him off a balcony is pretty satisfying.  Every boss fight and mini-boss fight have cinematic ""finishing sequences"" with Quick Time Events, and that's kind of annoiying if cool looking.  The boss fights also have a fixed camera angle which make for a more cinematic fight sequence, but a harder to control one.The story was ok, and this game is overall ok.  I did not play it at time of release and since i got it for like $2, it was ten hours well spent.			",12,1,0,1,0,0,5

												Despite the corny love story, I really enjoyed it. I'm not used to hack and slash genre but it was very satisfying being Starkiller and destroying everything in sight. It has nice locations. One walkthrough guarantees 12 hours of good fun but also some frustrations, because the game isn't perfect by any means. Often times I had to google what I should do next because there wasn't a clear indication. Some bosses feel real tough and annoying at times. The fact that we see Leia, Sen. Organa, Vader, Palpatine and even Darth Maul is great, because it feels very reminiscent. Also we see Vader in his prime, very strong and powerful. For 20 euro I'd say it's worth it for the story and memories, but it also is a fun game despite me being clueless half the time and the second half me raging at this ♥♥♥♥♥ucker boss that I died to for the 8th time. I do recommend.			",24,4,1,4,0,1,2

												The Force Unleashed is a third person action game, the big feature of the game is using force powers to lift up objects and live enemies, and then hurl them into walls etc to cause them massive damage. The main premise of the game is to go from point A and reach point B, whilst unleashing your force powers on hapless and not so hapless victims. You might think that being a force user equipped with a trusty light saber would make you most powerful against the toughest of foes, but ultimately as you play through the game, you’ll find that being an all powerful force user isn’t necessarily all that easy.The game takes you on a journey across multiple environments from inside spacecraft to swampy organic environments. There’s enough variety here to keep you interested, and although there’s a fair amount of corridor running around, you’ll also be faced with some impressive outdoor or more open expanses. I actually thought the graphics where pretty good for the most part and provide a slick looking game world to mess around in.The soundtrack is typical Star Wars fare, and you’ll instantly recognize the music and sound effects lifted from the movies. This creates an authentic Star Wars experience and will please the fans no end. Even the voice acting is of a high standard.If you’re going to run around the game world hunting for all the easter eggs and secrets, then of course the game is going to last quite some time. However, if you’re the type of gamer who’ll select the default difficulty and merely run from point A to B without really taking it all in properly, then your experience is going to be rather a short lived one, depending on your skill. It is entirely possible to run through the game very quickly. Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a more than a decent effort, but no doubt it will be more appreciated by the fans of the saga, than those who are not.			",90,4,0,12,10,0,24

												I played the original of this game on the PS2, then I come here and feel like it’s completely different. They have re done all the levels yet they follow a path to the original, extra cut scenes have been added and the original cut scenes have been redone to make it fit to the new look. The graphics have indeed improved and the upgrade system/lightsabers/holocrons has had a complete new rework. Furthermore 3 new “DLC” type chapters have also been added for free (part of this game) as well as massive amount of different costumes already given to you with the original ones still needing to play the game and find the secrets so that you can acquire them. I was extremely happy to see this change as it felt like playing a new game yet I knew exactly what was going happen and how the story would progress as thankfully they kept all of that exactly how it was. Lastly, I personally feel this game isn’t so bad and is still an amazing game within the Star Wars universe as it gives you an amazing backstory for Vader and Vader’s secret apprentice. Yes, although the game is unfortunately short they did add more, fixed most of the bug that I remember and really tried and made the game all over again. To me that means they care a lot as they did so much for the game and for the fans. Hope this helps and personally for me this feels like a classic so a 10/10 for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its a great and complex story. Worthy of the Star Wars saga. So go away and read the book. This game lacks a lot where it needs to be at least accepteble. Its a bad port. Menus are for a game-pad, the texture in the game is for big screen tv, making the game take enormus amount of your harddrive without looking good. You need to be lucky if you want the game to run good on your computer, a expensive video-card or processor dont ensures you anything. Gameplay looks great, but it really lacks the nice flow in battle that you can find even in the worst of the Assassins Creed or Batman Arkham-games. Its... stiff. And even if many attacks are fun at the start, you get tired of them. And its a hack and slash game thats very repetitive. New bosses or enemys dont change the formula that much at all. And all too soon the game ends. Its a real short game. It would have been great if they extended the first part of the games story with some more dlc. Intead we got non-canon endings and the dlc is very bad integrated in the game. Probobly the worst Iv seen. This game got potential, but dident live up to it at all. Its not a very bad game, some people do find it fun, even great, but all I see and feel is what it should have been. Look for Kotor-games if you want the great story, and Jedi Knights-game if you want great gameplay and force powers.			",55,2,0,2,2,0,8

												I used to play The Force Unleashed so much when I was younger, and it made its debut as the first Star Wars lightsaber combat game on the Wii. And the The Force Unleashed II spat right in its face, and everybody hated it.But, honestly, we all like to hate The Force Unleashed II... but wasn't this game bad since the beginning?I don't know how this game performs outside of the Wii or PC, but I can say the difference between these two versions is night and day. The Wii has worse graphics and level design (as usual)... but the PC has a lot more issues than I was expecting.For one, the game is buggier than the Amazon rainforest. Throughout most of the game, I was battling the game crashing, floors disappearing, sound effects cutting out, and even lightsabers being turned on in cutscenes where they obviously shouldn't be on. By the end of the main story of The Force Unleashed, the game was so broken that there was no music- not even any sound effects- save for Starkiller's lightsaber and footsteps.This could be a symptom of PC getting some of the worst ports of games that were originally intended for consoles. This is especially evident when playing QTE's, since the layout for the buttons isn't laid out for a keyboard and mouse. It's mapped out more for the four buttons on a 360 or PS3 controller, so I found myself failing several times because of where Q, E, and Left-Click were placed on the prompt.And since this is the first time I've played the HD version, I can say it's much shorter than the Wii's campaign. I know that the Wii story had a lot more unnecessary padding, often involving random trips to the Jedi Temple to fight a random Sith lord before the story decided to start picking up again. But the biggest flaw in this game's story (and really with its gameplay), is its horrible pacing.The story feels forced. Every beat, from being betrayed, to meeting the girl, to the conflicted interests, is all something like a cop on the run who's out for revenge after being betrayed. And the game rushes its cutscenes so quickly that it leaves little for the already paper-thin characters to feel empathetic or feel any drama going on in the plot.The pacing in the gameplay is also very off. Many times, I was just thrown in a large area with tons of enemies and upgrades placed around at random, and traversing around could be a massive pain in the a**, because the game can be so chaotic that it becomes stressful to try and manage what enemies to get or what upgrade to grab first.Also, like three characters die in the story and come back to life. Seriously. Rahm Kota, Starkiller, and PROXY should be officially dead for what happened to them, and yet the miraculously come back to life later in the story. Even Kota reveals that he wasn't blinded at all by the end of the game, which seems odd, seeing as how he took a lightsaber to his f***ing eyes!Another new feature to this PC port, is that it isn't just your average Force Unleashed copy... it comes with DLC! Packed with costumes you'll never use, ever! Seriously? Why would I want to just dress up as Jango Fett, if all I do is talk and play like Starkiller still? I know it doesn't matter to some people out there, but literally anyone can make a skin mod. I find this part of the DLC lazy as sh**.But along with the mounds of useless character skins, there's also three levels tacked onto the main story. I thought all three would be a continuation of the dark side ending, but I was wrong. Only two do. And the game purposely has you play them in the wrong order. The game has Hoth listed before Tatooine, even though the events happening suggest that what's going on on Tatooine is happening before Hoth.The new skins and lightning color didn't impress me. Hoth was pretty decent for what it was worth, as was Tatooine. They were both just average. But for f***s sake, who decided to make the Jedi Temple, and why is it even relevant as DLC? It's just a random deleted level from inside the Force Unleashed's main campaign with some incredibly unintuitive design and horribly simple puzzles. In the words of my uncle, while getting robbed at gunpoint, ""F*** this!""The Force Unleashed for the PC is bad. And boring. And predictable. It's got some incredibly simple combat within long, linear levels that don't award a player for their exploration, but more for accidentally running into a randomly-placed secret. It feels so unfinished, I expressed at one point that I was playing an unfinished beta. Do not play The Force Unleashed on Steam. It might be better for the last generation of consoles, but stray far from this game. I'm giving it a 4/10.			",184,74,0,14,4,0,2

												I finished this game in 10 hours which may seem like a negative thing to leave on a positive review but I just had to say it. The most challenging part of the game was the Star Destroyer part because PC controls aren't configured very well (Maul fight being close second). There's way too little content for a game worth £15. And the other content within the game to expand my gametime just involves collecting Holocrons in hidden parts of the map. THIS ISN'T A ♥♥♥♥ING LEGO GAME!That aside I would like to say that I think it's a fairly decent addition to my steam library. The gameplay was fairly decent and I enjoyed the sequence where you get to play as Vader. The story is fairly good as well dispite being slightly predictable at times. There was some pleasant and enjoyable twists and I felt symapthy for the characters. Overall I would rate 5/10 for the TERRIBLE PC port, but a solid 7/10 for the console version.			",55,5,0,5,6,0,3

Do not buy this game unless you like all the bad things about the console gaming.Unresponsive controls and battle - check. God damn it, even such old title as JK:JO had much more fluid sword fights. The lightsaber feels nothing like it should (light and fast, as the ""blade"" is weghtless). Not to mention the ridiculousness of dozens slices to kill a usual enemy. Come on, it's a lightsaber, not a stunbaton.Stupid camera angles - check. Why? It's nowhere near convenient. Damn you, consoles, you make these angles acceptable within general audience. Console fans, how can you play with such angles?The absense of video options - check. Lava that looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Visual and physical holes in the textures.Horribly designed menu - check. Everything about this game is just not good.To hell with this game. It's just awful, it's not fun at all. It's a console miscarriage of a game.			",84,9,1,8,7,0,14

												Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a hack and slash third person action game where you play as Galen Marek otherwise known as Starkiller or simply the apprentice. After witnessing your father killed by Darth Vader at a young age you are taken by him to be his secret apprentice and tasked to kill the remaining jedi in the galaxy. Over the course of the story you experience betrayal and side with an early Rebel Alliance. The game tells a pretty solid story, but the gameplay gets repetitive overtime. The game makes you feel like a badass as you kill multiple enemy types and are given multiple force powers like force lightening and repulse. Pros:- wide variety of force powers and upgrades- skins and lightsaber crystals- excellent story- range of planets you visit that are each distinct and feel star wars- great voice actingCons- sometimes repetitive combat- mixed quality in level designverdict:Overall this game has stuck with me for a long time and the characters like starkiller have been very memorable. This is a game that I would highly recommend for the story and has decent enough combat to keep you entertained for hours.			",205,20,1,11,9,0,9

												I really want to give this game a recommendation, I really do. When the game works, you feel like a true Sith. Throwing things at enemies, firing Force Lightning at them or just flat out throwing them off ledges/into walls is immensely satisfying. You feel like a god among men. The problem, though is that the times the game works are few and far between.Overall, the game just feels wrong on PC. The combat controls are loose and the camera is painful, even with an Xbox 360 controller. Several enemies have way more melee range than you do and are guaranteed a knock down. Their animations are also hard to interrupt, meaning the fastest way to defeat them is actually to use Force Grab and throw them off the nearest cliff/down the closest pit. Using Force Grab to throw things at enemies just does not work most of the time. It sort of works with a controller and about 30% of the time, you'll throw it at an enemy. The other 70% of the time, you'll either throw it off a cliff or into a wall about 30 feet to the side of the enemy. Trying to do it with keyboard/mouse is even more impossible.Force Lightning is satisfying, but only with the second upgrade where you can actually hold the button and fire lightning for as long as you have Force energy. The first level is useless for the most part as it only affects one or two enemies, though it's nice for stunning them.I won't comment on the combos because I'm terrible at combos in any game I play and thus consider them stupid in all games.The quick-time events (and there are a lot of them) are far too quick. You will have to repeat them at least once unless you have above average reaction time. This would be alright except that failing a quick-time often will heal the boss/miniboss, which is a terrible but effective way to pad out a fight's length.The biggest complaint I have, though, is that the game is riddled with bugs. The game crashed for me three times in the same boss fight. The only time it didn't crash, the boss' attack knocked me out of the world, trapping me outside the boss arena and making the fight impossible to complete. There are numerous other bugs I could add to this list, but those are the worst offenders. Having to restart a boss fight four times because of bugs/crashing is unacceptable and frustrating.

Of course, the story is very... not inaccurate, but it just strays too far from the main Star Wars lore, all though it's still interesting. My only problem with this game has only to do with my computer. The game runs fine, but whenever I'm outside, the sky is an extreme blur. Inside is fine, but when I'm bringing down the Imperial Star Destroyer in the junk planet, I don't see a ship, just the fire the engines is emitting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game a really long time ago when it first came back, and when i got it again on steam i was extremely excited to play it again! Although it being hard at some points it was overall a really enjoyable experience with a suprisingly good storyBE WARNED: there is a glitch in the pc version where most of the SFX stops working during a certain legnth of the game.(I think it happend for me on the begining of the second last level and fixed itself about half way through the last level)All in All i love this game, the gameplay is fun and story enjoyable.And for me it was pure nostalgia :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It had been awhile since I played a great Star Wars game, and this felt like meeting an old friend. No, he isnt Kyle Katarn, but it is a blast to be able to wield the force in such an over the top manner. Really enjoyable game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has some really clunky camera and sometimes uncomfortable controls (dat Star Destroyer). And no proper save games, so you are going to get really frustrated after you fought through 95% of enemies on the level and died. Like, sometimes, REALLY frustrated. But... if you're looking for a good story, based on Star Wars - this is your best shot after KOTOR.			",67,5,1,9,2,0,6

												This game is fine. just fine nothing more nothing less so painfully mediocre that it might be a detrement.Combat is cool at times but most of the time it doesn't work.The story is by far the best aspect of this game (not saying much).anyways I got this in a humble bundle with a bunch of other pretty great games so i'm not considering playing this a waste of time if you get it for free.All in all I would pay $3 for this game  ",88,17,0,14,10,2,15

												Let me just say this, besides some of the glitches and some what clunky level design this game has a excellent story. Being a Star Wars fan all my life I am confident to say this. It has intresting characters, sad and dark moments, great choice of bosses, two different endings, bonus missions that offer a different side of the story and many other great features, worth your money even when not on sale.

												I played the Wii version and I really enjoyed the storyline. The game itself is kinda challenging depending on how you play but it is pretty fun overall. There is a lot of custimization options which are pretty nice and skin changes let you play the game as basically any character from the Star Wars universe.If you are a fan of Star Wars then you will probably enjoy this game.I rate it a 8.5/10. Camera angles are a bit challenging at times.			",56,1,0,7,3,3,1

												Star Wars franchise had a lot of very good and very bad games. This is the latter and even more: it's god awful port of god awful game.30fps and crashes, ugly and no settings (there is like 1 tickbox, resolution and brightness). While 30fps lock can be fixed, the game itself doesn't worth it. It's pathetic attempt on mixing slasher and gravity gun mechanics. Controls are pretty badly designed, especially gravity throws that rarely work properly, there is no animation cancel, no proper avoid or block (both is there but basically unusable) etc. It's just primitive underdeveloped slasher with awful controls set in star wars universe. Feels very unpolished and underdeveloped. It is one of those games you play through just to see if it gets any better. And it does not. The game just doesn't function as a game which becomes more obvious the more you play it. It's just a bunch of cool concepts that wasn't developed into anything even remotely working together.

												Yes, there are some flaws. One that stands out, taking down the Death Star ""boss."" Extremely long and boring and ultimately frustrating. But beyond that, this is a damn good game. Its true, it pisses all over Star Wars lore. I dont recall Luke ever battling Vaders apprentice in Hoth, but gamewise, its good. SImple as that. The powers are very cool. Its incredibly satisfying to impale a force held trooper with your black lightsaber. The little additions, such as costume and the different gems and colours for lightsabers add to it. If your a fan of Star Wars, but not a fanatic, you'll truly enjoy this game.			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												Great game where you can manipulate almost everything on screen! Not as bad as people have said! I've played this on PS3 and bought it again for PC, it's so much fun!You do have to have a good CPU, graphics card and memory combo in your PC to run it well.I first played it with an AMD Quad core 2.3Ghz and ATI 6670 card and found that setting up a good amount of virtual memory on my hard drive helped A LOT! This game works on 3D TV/monitors with Tridef3D drivers FYI. Awesome in stereoscopic 3D!			",313,25,2,13,9,3,10

												Pretty Good Game Review Considering (PGGRC) 9.8 Hours to CompleteTL;DR - This game is weird. Everything the game does should make we not recommend the game. But I still do. Here is why... Right out the gate you’re going to see simple textures, bad pop in and a 30fps frame rate. Yet I always had fun. The game is an excellent “simulator” of being a sith lord. Maybe this is the star wars nostalgic but this game even though is broken I really liked it. In depth: Performance - a 30fps frame rate. Funny thing is the game still felt and looked smooth. Not to mention the semi-destructible environments are a huge pro.Graphics - Below average in places. Right out the gate you’re going to see simple textures, bad pop in. Locations are beautiful from far and very different. Gameplay - Solid. II love throwing people into statues and watching them break apart or forcing pushing them up in the air, throwing my sabre into his chest and throwing him into a tree. Feels great. The camera is a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥ and controls are a tad clunky but it did not annoy me too much. Bosses are challenging, Sometimes cheap won’t name any names but you will know don’t worry, and to beat a boss results in a QTE that if you fail punishes you hard. I hate QTE as it’s lazy but in this case it still was great as it felt like you kicked the living ♥♥♥♥ out of a boss and that was your reward to see your character look like a badass. It’s also very repetive but it did not feel that way due to the range of powers, abilities, locations plus the sandbox destructible environments.The story is actually quite interesting and decent. Fits in right between episode 3 and 4 and to be honest should be made into a movie. I love proxy and his relationship with the protagonist was unique. All the powers and combos vary up combat making you into a badass. The costume selection is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. I count like 40+ unique outfits being different variations of the protagonist or different characters in the star wars lore. The three missions outside of the main story are nice what if spin off missions and are quite good but familiar to main story. Some glitches only one was game stopping and one crash. Replayability - As you can unlock everything in one playthrough, if you’re good enough, it does lack here. Conclusion - Overall a game that’s weird but I really enjoyed despite bad cons which would break other games. Maybe it’s due to that I a star wars fan XDIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow my curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/FALLENV3GAS#curation ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the biggest disappointments for a triple-A title, let alone a Star Wars title, in recent years. This (obvious) PC port of the 360/PS3 Star Wars game is hopelessly flawed by lucratively overpowered enemies, broken maps, ZERO in-game graphics options, terrible camera angles, and glitchy controls. There is no checkpoint/quicksave system, requiring you to redo the insane boss battles over and over again. The battles? Boss battles should be moderately enjoyable, to be able to pull off some combo attacks. Well, no. Every boss has unavoidable attacks and will annihilate you before you have any chance to get the boss to 50% health.Stick to Battlefront II or any of the other fantastic Star Wars titles, skip this miserable mess.

												Star Wars The Force Unleashed tells the (non-canon) story of how the rebellion started. You play as Starkiller, Darth Vaders secret aprentiance. The story is one of the best told in a Star Wars game. The game is mostly good. The gameplay is third person hack and slash. The only weapons you have is you lightsaber. You also have force abilities like force push, force lightning etc. The only changes that you can make to your light saber is the blades color/colour. As you play you gain force points (XP) and whe you have enough, you gain a level. As you gain levels you can upgrade you abilities. The graphics are amazing for its time and the environment hold up today. The character models are outdated and ugly. The bigest problem I had was this game was techincal problems and the Star Destroyer. I had numerous graphical bugs and one game breaking bug through one playthrough. The Star Destroyer part (Near the end of the game) took me one hour of retries to complete. That part is just plain bad. Following the button promts didn't help and I eventualy got through by trying it my own way. Its still a great game, but due to the bugs and age of the game I'll only recommend it at half price and less.			",383,62,12,32,26,3,50

												Old game by now, not so pretty by today standards. Gameplay is quite OK albeit it's repetitive and frustrating here and there. Game is basically a third person action adventure with lightsaber. It's as generic as it gets, but it has one pro that takes it above average and that's the Star Wars licence. So...Pros:- it's Star Wars with all the good stuff (Vader, AT-ST, Rancor, ... royal guards, Emperor ^^ )- interesting story- character powers and upgrades (lightning strike FTW)- some Boss battles are rly fun- physics mby,  but its bad for what we are used todayCons:- some enemies are block ♥♥♥♥♥s- stun chains, like rly you can just go from 100 to 0% health and you don't get any interrupt- confusing level design- some Boss battles are just ... frustrating- technical issues (missing sound effects in last 3 levels, there is a fix for that)If you are not SW fan don't bother, otherwise consider.

												Have you ever wanted to be a Jedi knight or a Sith Lord? Have dominion over the force and use it to crush your enemies or unite your allies? Then this might be the game for youThis game was tremendous amounts of fun. I am biased because I like Star Wars but still, with a ton of force powers and duel lightsabers, this game was just fantastic. Even from the beginning you feel like a one man army, ripping ships from the sky and hurling them at anyone who stands in your way. The power trip you get from literally cutting your way through a horde of bad guys is something to behold.The setting is wonderful, obviously, as its Star Wars. The levels take place on many different planets and starships leading to a reasonable verity of settings and environmental challenges. The enemy design is fantastic and varied; from Wookies to Tie Fighters you battle them all. The game is not the best looking but it still holds up to this day as rather pretty. The characters and story were both very engrossing and I was compelled to see what happened to everyone and how it would play out in the end. It even adds some depth to the original movies, showing what goes on behind the scenes and adds to the feel of a living universe.There were a few issues however that hampered my enjoyment. This is not a good port at all. The controls can feel clunky and the menu operation is a pain. There were a few glitches, not so many that they spoil anything but enough to notice. There was one section that was almost impossible with the mouse and I had to look it up, it was really obvious once I found the answer but the game doesn’t do a very good job of explaining.I would recommend this game to Star wars fans and haters alike. Its super fun and a great time. Even at full price you will get something out of it.Have fun ^_^			",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

												Note: I recommend yes for thos who have not played this game, and no for those who have.I used to play this game all the time on my Xbox 360, that being said this is actually a pretty solid game itself, of course all console ports are generally locked at 30 FPS so if you want 60 FPS I'd install a patch, although I've heard the patch can screw up the game even further.  In my opinion this game has held up decently, but the second game although short is defintely almost a direct improvement in almost every way to this game.[h] Problems with the Game: [/h]-Metric ton of glitches.-Bosses are incredibly predictable and mainly you lose because they just spam the same attack over and over.-A lot of button mashing and quick time events(The second game made these less frequent and actually fair)-Most bosses aren't difficult, but just cheap (Spoiler Alert for the few that haven't completed this game)  Such as Vader who despite how much you mash the buttons can't break free from his Force Grap attack -Lots of sound glitches (These can be fixed by a patch)-Less features than the other versions of the game (Same for the Xbox 360, even though it had a better system than the PS2, PSP, and the Wii). -Story that for the most part is boring (Except for Darth Vader and his Apprentice, and the whole founding of the Rebel Alliance thing (Which this game isn't canon anymore)Good Things: -A wide variety of enemies to face.-Each level is almost drastically different (With a few exceptions)-Fun gameplay.-An entire gallery of artwork for the game to look through.-Customizable clothing and lightsaber.-A variety of force powers to use.-About 17 different combos that can be used.

Hate Leads To SufferingWhat to expect from this game?This game is about the adventures of a Sith apprentice of ""Darth Vader."" You will visit some unearthly worlds to gain experience and collect holocrons for game advancements. Throughout the journey you will combat Wookies, Wampas, Jawas, droids, lesser lifeforms, Rebel scum and other Imperial forces who get in your way. Will you be able to become the most powerful Jedi/Sith ever to live?What are the Pros of this game? Great Graphics/Visuals Exporing ""Star Wars"" locations (Star Destroyer, Death Star, etc.) Destructable environment (limited areas) Using Force powers at will Slaying lifeforms Hunting Jedi Fighting ""Star Wars"" Heroes/villainsWhat are the Cons of this game? Limited""Star Wars"" locations are explored Very limited destruction areas Poor gaming controls/targeting system Force power is unbalanced (can move star freighters but not an AT-ST?) Very linear gameplay and storyline ""Star Wars"" Heroes/villains can't be destroyed Camera angles during duels are horribleWhy do you recommend this game?I only recommend this game for fans of the ""Star Wars"" universe, due to great visuals and loose tie-in story to the original ""Star Wars"" movie trilogy (Part IV - Part VI). This game had so much potential, but the game's playablitity is comical.  Not able to cut enemies in half or limbs off with a Lightsaber really bothered me, while unable to break enemies with a Force Grip.  (Maybe I am just asking too much, but ""Jedi Academy"" games got the combat balanced done right)[As a gamer, play ""Jedi Academy"" games instead or KOTOR]			",78,9,0,10,2,1,6

												An over the top TPS game taking place in the Star Wars universe. Some of the force powers you have are so strong that you can take down AT&Ts and later on a star destroyer, too. You do, literally, unleash the force in this game to its full potential. This also means that the focus is on the action not story telling so you may find this game disappointing if one of your favourite SW games is the Knights of The Old Republic or another RPG taking place in the same universe.Unfortunately, the game is horribly optimised. You install 25 gigabytes on your hard drive. Today this size is common but this is a 5-year old game. Additionally, there can be bugs and glitches and just because the Ultimate Edition is offered for purchase for PC gamers it's not an excuse for not looking into its issues. Personally, I did not find the story particularly interesting. I got that it was about Vader's secret apprentice but there are so many games out there taking place in the era of the old trilogy as well as the new one that I was already fed up with these.Anyway, this is not necessarily a bad game. It is an interesting concept and you really have some amazing power at your disposal. If this over the top approach does not deter you then I recommend this game but only the first one as the sequel was a very, very (and I mean very) short one and a complete disappointment.

												Being a huge Star Wars fan, I can honestly say I loved this game a lot. If you're a fan of Star Wars, this game is a must buy! Even if you're not that into Star Wars, this game is still great! I liked how this game lets you ""power up"" skills, talents, etc... and it definitely makes your character interesting, as well as your ability to be able to customize your lightsaber. The game is definitely NOT boring and if you play on a harder mode, it will definitely be somewhat challenging. The boss fights are pretty neat, and each one you fight is slightly different. I also loved how at the end they made you choose between the Light/Dark side so there are actually two separating endings to the game. Either way, it's kind of sad how it ends though. Playing the game, you not only play as Starkiller but you also begin to connect with him (at least I did) and Juno and this definitely was a determining factor in me loving the game so much. Finally, the graphics are absolutely gorgeous.Now, the things I don't like. First off, the game was pretty short. I finished this game in 7 hours (did mess around in some parts) and I really wished it was longer. Another thing I don't like was how you can just run past a lot enemies to get to the boss fight for some missions and I really wish fights weren't so optional as to make the game a bit more challenging. As much as swinging around a lightsaber and killing enemies is cool, I wish the game wasn't so ""hack and slash"" and make enemies a bit more challenging so you can't just swing around your lightsaber all the time (it gets really boring).All in all, it's a game I would high recommend!

												This game is very overrated. I therefor was pretty disappointed by it in the beginning. The things that annoyed me:Abysmal PC-port. Capped at 30 FPS with physic screw ups when unlocked, no mouse control in the menus. Keyboard and mouse control is flawed, I managed to bear with it since i don't have a controller, but you may not want to bother with it.There are levels missing sound files! There is a fix available on PC Gaming Wiki, but it still is incredibly annoying.Excessive amount of QTEs. This one probably bothers me the most, especially when you are forced to go through the same one over and over again. Having to look at the button prompts while there is a nice scene playing out is infuriating.Pretty bad tie in of game mechanics and story. Instead of having a cutscene where the apprentice gets taught force lighting by Vader (which would be interesting since Vader can't summon it) or discovers the skill by himself there just is a text popping up at the start of one level.The game starts of slowly. Literaly. While it is cool to be Vader in the first level, he moves like a slug. That leads to the level way overstaying its welcome and almost had me quit the game prematurely.Now, why do I still recommend this game? Well, after getting a bit more comfortable with the game mechanics I had fun with this game:The combos and fighting in general. You really see where they put the focus when developing the game. My favourite thing probably is to charge up my lightsaber with force lightning. It looks amazing, feels amazing and also is effective.The level variety is phenomenal. From the surgical steel of an ISD to Sarlacc intestines you get to see a lot of one of the most interesting universes there is.The Story is nice. It really fleshes out Vaders character and his relationship with emperor Palpatin in a similar way Shadows of the Empire did. It is no longer ""high canon"" with Disneys new policy and may soon be overridden by the Rebels cartoon, but it still is worthwhile. It is not incredibly deep and sometimes not too believeable, but then again, has Star Wars ever been?The graphics were revolutionary when the game came out. As any game with photorealistc graphics they did suffer brutaly from age. What saves it is the quality of animation, it feels just on spot in so many situations. This ties in closely with the combos being so statisfying.So in conclusion I would say get this game when it is on sale and if you have a controller. Do not expect a masterpiece that will blow you away. It is a nice Star Wars experience with pretty sweet combat.			",55,6,1,7,5,2,3

												This is a bad console port with clumbsy controls, long stun locks, random spikes in difficulty, long load times (even between menus!), terrible level design, crappy checkpoints, bugged out sound, bugged out cameras, long unskippable cutscenes, and awkward UI. PC controls makes 1 boss battle impossible. I can't believe a game can be this bad, and 20 gigabytes of bloated mess to boot. The story seems to be competent, but there are so many parts of the game that are unfun that I just can't stand to finish it.			",203,76,9,41,16,1,31

												Ah yes, Star Wars the Force Unleashed...This is an enjoyable game, a game I would recommend especially on PC. I have played it on WII, PS3, and PC and it is best on a computer. Get it on sale as it is not worth an expensive purchase...however you'll have fun with it and it'll last you a while.			",44,5,1,3,2,0,1

												Its a STAR WARS saga - 3rd person game where you play like a JEDI KNIGHT (better to say a converted SITH trained by DARTH VADER).Game is very hard even on ""hard"" settings (hardest setting will open after you complete the game on hard settings) so not a piece of cake this time ... even of that 8 or better to say 9 hours play is still a better one ... and dont forget ""the hardest setting"" ... so you need to play it all thru again to ""complete whole game"" ... so ... 9 hours + ""hardest settings play time"" ... is a great PLAY TIME from this ""PS3 exclusive game"" pretty awesome.Also this is an ""PS3 controller type"" game so ... playing it with keyboard was a little complicated when camera start to be ""scripted"" or ""static"" ... BUT !!! they still ""transfer"" it great from ""an controller"" type to keyboard+mouse control.Also there some RPG elements in game. Like there is an system of upgrades for you mental, saber and power skills. Also there is an ""caracter garderobe"" and a ""light saber shop"" ... but some of these upgrades are not accessible from the beginning and you must collect them thru the game (some are pretty tought).Story telling is also pretty awesome (like all other STAR WARS saga games/movies). I will not tell you what is the game story (to not ruin in to you).+ long game time (up to 9 hours!)+ playable (hard and the ""hardest"" settings)+ hard settings is realy ""HARD SETTINGS""+ PS3 controller transformation to keyboard/mouse+ RPG elements (skills, charakter, saber)+ lot of BOSS fights+ ""POWER""+ Lightsaber+ Story+ STAR WARS saga collector ... IS A MUST !!!- CONSOLE (xbox, ps3) exclusive game (was)- PS3 controller transformation- graphics- only 9 hours of play (hard settings)- hard settings is realy ""HARD SETTINGS"" (n00b gamers beware !!!)Graphics : 6/10Sounds/Music : 7/10Story : 8/10PS3 : 8/10 (PS3 to K/M controller)Camera : 6/10 (sometimes was realy frustrating)---------------------------------------------------Verdict: 9,5/10.

Star Wars: The Force Unleashed - Ultimate Sith EditionA simple pros & cons overview follows below.I remember playing this back when it came out and thinking it was just awesome. The technical prowess of Digital Molecular Matter and the likes was enough to look past an at times overly melodramatic story, cringeworthy dialog and voice acting performances, clichéd characters, and an often irritating targeting system and gameplay mechanics. Unfortunately, close to 8 years down the line, I'm forced to realise that breaking stuff and making it look pretty is basically much all that TFU does well. As opposed to some games with a lot of heart that retain a certain charm even after a few years, The Force Unleashed doesn't seem to have aged all that well. The only thing it had going for it was that it looked good, and by today's standards that's just not true anymore. Sadly, this only serves to emphasise all of its original flaws. It also feels ridiculously overpriced at the time of writing this.In light of the above, I'd recommend catching up on the story and moving straight to the sequel which, if nothing else, looks a lot better with a slightly improved gameplay.Pros:Mildly interesting story set between episodes III and IV;Wreaking havoc with the Force is still pretty fun at times (especially once you've levelled up);Sith Edition includes a lot of additional content (levels, skins).Cons:Poor controls and targeting;Ridiculous amount of loading screens;Graphics haven't aged well;Some irritatingly overwhelming encounters;Some cringeworthy dialog and voice acting performances, clichéd characters.

												Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a 3rd person Hack and Slash game based in teh Star Wars universe. It is very similar to games such as DMC, Ninja Gaiden, and God of War. The story takes place in between episodes 3 and 4 and you play as Starkiller, Darth Vader's secret apprentice. The story is actually really good and has tons of set pieces throughout the 9 main story levels and the 3 DLC levels. You're tasked with assassinating several Jedi that survived Order 66, but later wonder if working for the empire is the right thing to do. The story has two endings, one that is the good/right ending and the other is the bad/wrong ending. The DLC continues off of the bad ending in which Starkiller goes full Sith and is tasked with hunting down several of the original trilogy's cast members, including Obi-Wan and Luke. The gameplay is pretty standard for a Hand and Slash/ Spectacle fighter game. The only new thing it has to offer is the force powers you can use in between Lightsaber combat. You get force powers such as force lightning and grapple. You can also throw your lightsaber later on. The game is locked at 30 frames per second and it does have a few bugs here and there such as the sound from blasters not playing or certain characters having textures that makes them look like the're covered by some sort of shadow. Overall though this is my favorite Star Wars game, yes even better than Knights of the Old Republic and Battlefront 2. I highly recommend you pick it up regardless of the price as it is well worth every penny if you are a big Star Wars or just looking for a fun action game with a good story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You don't know the power of the Dark Side!Star Wars - The Force Unleashed is a 3rd person action game where you assume the role of Starkiller, better known as the secret apprentice of Darth Vader. Your primary goal is to help the Empire vanquish all the remaining Jedi and stand by the Emperor's side, ruling the galaxy.Story: The Force Unleashed's events are set between Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and Episode IV: A New Hope. The game starts off with you controlling Darth Vader, on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyk, searching for Jedi to eliminate. There he finds a boy with an extraordinary aptitude for the Force and from that point on, takes him on as a secret apprentice to one day assassinate the Emperor. It is from that point on, that we assume the role of Starkiller for the remaining time of the game. As the story progresses, we get to see him form a close relationship with his female pilot, Juno Eclipse, and this eventually blossoms into a romance, which adds a dimension to the tale. Along the way, we also get to see the personalities of the Jedi we must hunt down, each one with an interesting insight to give on the ways of the Force as well as having their own unique powers and strengths. Last but not least, we also get to see alot of what Vader thinks of his protege's accomplishments and even the Emperor himself. The story is well-told and at times can even evoke emotion.Graphics: For a game released in 2009, the Force Unleashed looks good. The graphics are well detailed, with high resolution textures and vivid colour palettes. Some of the locales the player gets to visit are just bursting with detail, from lush forests to sometimes barren wastelands. There is always variety to be found in the areas Starkiller visits.Sound: All the sound effects Star Wars fans have come to know and love are all there, and done to the highest quality. From the iconic laser blasts from the rifle of a Stormtrooper to the ominous thuds an AT-ST emits as it lumbers across the battlefield. I have to give a special mention to the voice actors who gave Starkiller and Juno life. Their renditions of the characters are superb and really sell the relationship which these two characters develop along the course of their journey. Also, the voice actor behind the Emperor did a fantastic job and you would be hard pressed to find someone who sounds any better.Gameplay: At the time of release, The Force Unleashed's gameplay was heavily marketed as something cool and innovative. Up until that point, there was no Star Wars game which let you completely unleash upon your enemies these outrageous Force powers and made you feel like a god. The lightsaber combat although good and varied, sometimes feels sluggish and awkward. For example, if you were in the middle of a melee combo there would be no way to quickly cancel it so you would be left vulnerable to an attack from the side or from behind. This can be really frustrating when you are trying to finish off this one opponent, but someone sneaks up to youand interrupts your combo string. Now, moving onto the movement. Controlling Starkiller is fine for the most part, however, when you want to jump and dash it feels clumsy and unelegant. It feels like a chore to perform these maneuvers and this in my opinion, is one of the game's biggest flaws. However, the Force powers you get access to are awesome. Being able to Force push and electrocute large groups of enemies at a time feels satisfying, is efficient and makes you feel like a complete boss. The Force has never been represented better in a video game.Overall, Star Wars - The Force Unleashed is a good action game. Although it innovates in certain areas like the way the player can use Force powers, it is let down by the stiffness of the controls. Star Wars fans would love this game while others may only like this game.7/10.			",190,5,2,16,3,2,10

												Disclaimer: I am a massive Star Wars fan so I may be biasedStar Wars: The Force Unleashed is not a polished game by any means.  The framerate is locked at 30 FPS (although there is an unlocker which I strongly reccomend) and there are numerous texture issues such as pop-in and flickering. The keyboard controls aren't great either (I used a 360 controller).  However these issues aside, the game is damn fun.  You have multiple different force powers and tons of combos you can pull off as well.  The story so far is fantastic and the characters have genuine feeling and it is very noticeable that the voice actors Lucasarts have hired are seasoned veterans in the voice acting industry.  I would recommend this only to Star Wars fans or hardcore hack and slash fans and only those that own a controller, as that really is how this game is meant to be played.			",784,176,40,77,64,10,101

												This game is a nightmare to play. I like Star Wars a lot, but this game's gameplay is just too frustrating for me to be able to enjoy it. Let me give you a few reasons why that's the case. First of all, the controls are terrible. Making fine movements is a chore, aiming for a precise place to land when jumping is close to impossible. The camera gets constantly in your way, stuck in objects, etc... Using the force is fun, but the aiming is horrendous. Half the time, you're grabing something else, throwing it somewhere you didn't want to, etc... The level design is monotoneous and questionable at best, I've died several times because I just wasn't able to differentiate whether the character can stand on what seemed like solid ground or whether he will slide down into a pit. Battle mechanics are VERY limited, get boring quick and some design choices are real head scratchers to me, like: why you always have to move forward when swingin the light saber? You can't hit somebody standing on the edge of a pit or you'll fall in too. Add bugs, crashes, an incredibly slow loading menu and you're in for a huge disappoinment.			",123,15,4,21,14,2,16

												As far as the graphics and the looks of  the game goes, its pretty good. but after playing it for about an hour The game started to make me very angry. The control feels cluncky and unatrual on the keyboard and the blasted camera angle is truely aweful especially during boss battles. I constantly miss... well everything because i really cant tell which direction hes facing. It feels like a fast paced battle but he fumbles all over the place so its not very fluent. It was very upsetting also when I was attacked by mainly mini bosses and i was well out of their range yet i still took damage and knock back. basiclly the contact point of enemies and your self isnt very presice at all. If you want to play what this game is trying to be, play jedi academy. that game is Awesome!			",62,9,0,12,12,0,8

												This game is fantastic. Not sure what the negative reviews are about; the controls are a little loose and tough to master but all it takes is a little practice.Gameplay: Really fun and immersive. It does get slightly repetitive, since about half-way through the game you've already met all the enemies. I did find three bugs and I had to restart the level to fix them but overall a decent port. The Force powers are varying and really fun to use. You're supposed to use combos to kill enemies but you only need to know one or two main combos to deal a lot of damage. Apart from 3PS murder there's quicktime events for takedowns (which are fun and at the perfect level of difficutly, since you'd land a perfect one about 50% of the time and towards the end of the game you have them memorized for easy killing) and one sidescrolling level that was a pain to do but enjoyable.The customization is one of the strong points of this game (even though the menus take forever to load). You can change costumes into droids, stormtroopers, clones, a variety of Sith or Jedi, and about ten alternate Starkiller costumes.  You can change lightsaber colors and also pick a passive effect for the lightsaber, such as health drain or added crit.The boss battle are fun for the most part. I had to restart the Star Destroyer boss level multiple times because of a reoccurring bug, but I encountered no other issues. Honestly, most of them were slightly too easy; I beat them in one or two tries. Graphics: Outdated; it's an old game. Still, they're not bad looking. In the cutscenes especially, the level of detail on Starkiller's face is amazing. Yes the graphics are old; no they are not bad nor do they deter from the game.Music: Really fantastic. A good mix of the classic soundtrack and totally new, dark themes full of powerful swells that really make you feel awesome. There were a few spots in the game where there was no music and that didn't feel right; the sounds of slaughter DO need accompaniment.Story: The story itself is quite good. Unfortunately, it's really low on character development; you can tell everything you need to know about a character simply from looking at them. The Force Unleashed books really fixed that; if you love the story its a good read and a slight improvement over the game's story. Still, its an epic saga and it really gets good towards the end as it becomes less mindless Jedi killing and there's actually emotion. The ending is fantastic.Overall, it's made its way into one of my favorite games off all time.			",98,11,0,2,5,0,8

												The good:Surprisingly decent Star Wars storyPhysics engine that lets you throw things around with thte force like in the moviesThe bad:Poor controls (don't always respond when you need them, i.e. for double jumping over a chasm)Stun locking enemies (they stunlock you and you die)Annoying boss battles with an overabundance of quick time eventsTerrible auto targetting for force abilitiesUnskippable cutscenes for every levelNo quick save (only checkpoints, some of which are poorly placed)Relatively short game overallThe ugly:A contender for one of the worst console ports of all time (very poorly optimized, doesn't support resolutions over 1920x1200 in the options menu, can only switch between xbox controller and keyboard outside of the game, and if your controller gets disconnected you have to restart the game to get control back). Also REQUIRES virtual memory/paging to be turned on with no way to skip it (even if you have a system with 16GB+ of RAM).Conclusion: Could have been an awesome game, but it has a multitude of issues that will have you throwing your keyboard/controller in frustration. It's also very short for a AAA game with very little replayability. Not recommended at anything above a bargain basement price ($20 is too much even).			",549,183,19,71,76,4,115

												Rating: 6.5/10Overview: Third Person Hack and Slash The Good:+The story is pretty decent even if it feels ‘shoe horned’ into the Star Wars universe. The story does provide good context and keeps the game together. +Every level has a unique look and feel to it.  +Find collectables scattered through out the level to upgrade powers, abilities and combos. +Sound Effects+Cool force powers and effectsThe Average:The combat feels average at best. Even though you have a lightsaber and really cool force powers, none of it feels powerful or impactful. The enemies feel like canon fodder and the targeting systems is too unpredictable. Given that you can lift and throw many objects in the level it becomes frustrating when it targets the wrong thing. Sometimes when I wanted to throw my lightsaber, it would target the piece of debris rather than the enemy standing right in front of me.  Boss battles suffer because of the combat. What should be epic fights turn into frustrating experiences.   Levels are very linear and play out almost the same way every time making for a somewhat repetitive experience. Kill a bunch of enemies, move to the next open area and do it all over again. There is not enough gameplay variety or puzzles to mix things up.The Bad:- lack of graphical options - Changing audio does not effect CGI cut- scenes - Graphical and sound glitches, crash to desktop - Final Boss battle has a glitch forcing you to reload over and over again until you no longer experience the game stopping glitch  - Without spoiling anything there is a final section of a level near the end of the game that is incredibly frustrating. Conclusion:A game that has a lot of great ideas but fails in execution. What should have been an amazing experience feels frustrating. If you love Star Wars then you may get enjoyment from this, but there are plenty of other third person adventure games out there worthy of your time.   ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												I played through the whole game on PS3 and remembered enjoying it. I saw it on sale here on Steam and couldn't help but pick up this ""ultimate PC version."" It's a terrible port plain and simple. Its poorly optimized and the game has just not aged well. You cannot even alt-tab out of it (the game will crash). Not to mention the Steam Overlay will not open or function during the games cinematics. Yes, this means no screenshots. The game had some problems my first time playing back on PS3 as it can get boring and repetitive. This on top of all these issues of the PC port and the game is just not worth it. I recommend trying The Force Unleashed II on PC as it will give you the games overall feel but with a better experience. Save your money, this was not the Star Wars game you were looking for.

												Great combat, great physics. The game looks very good even though it's a couple years older. The fights are intense, however if you want to play at one of the higher difficulties, it does require extreme pacience and can get frustrating at times. The story does a great job of patching up the gap between the two trilogies. In my opinion it achieves what it set out to do and does it to a very high standard, with smooth cutscenes and superb voice acting. I definetly recomended it for fans of the Star Wars series, and not only. A must have.			",141,13,4,27,11,0,5

												This is not a bad game. Just want to say that off the bat because I am gonna sound a bit negative here. This game has serious problems. Brain dead AI, rough boss fights, irritating level design, and♥♥♥♥♥♥poor menu navigation, with a loading screen in between each one, and the 30 fps frame lock, this game has a ton of problems that stop it from being great. Now on to the goodThis game has genuinely beautiful graphics, and the star wars universe is realized in a fantastic way. From the Hoth levels in the DLC, to the acid and junk world of Raxus Prime, this game has a lot to offer. The character designs are stunning as well. I remember years ago when this game was coming out, seeing how they motion captured the actors for the characters, and it shows. In addition, there are a ton of DLC costumes that are awesome to screw around in, from playing as C3PO, to old sith lords. My favorite was the Sith Assassin armor, with the black lightsaber. All in all, get this game on sale if you can, because it is worth a playthrough.			",120,15,0,15,9,2,17

												In a similar vein to many other reviews of this game i will begin by noting that the game has a few problems which i will get to but over all i liked it and found it to be a pretty decent game that despite its flaws does a great job of doing what it sets out to do, allow you to play a force wielding badass is a way that shows how powerful the force can be when utilised by somone creative.You play as Darth vaders secretive apprentice Star killer who for all intents and purposes seems to be one of the most powerful force wielders in the entire sw universe which is great fun to play. Graphics are great, if a little ropey and inconsistent at times. The controls are mostly really good but the camera can be a little shakey at times which results in the usual quick turns, or not, and a somtimes messed up targeting system, i will note that i played this with an xbox pad as i didnt think it played well with mouse and keyboard. The story is reallly great and in many ways the star of tthe show and it takes you to a great mix of locations from the sw universe, there are rp elements in that you can upgrade your powers and abilities as you level and there are holocrons littered throughout the stages for you to find and collect. On a negattive note its pretty unfinished and badly optimised for pc with stuttery cutscenes and most of the stages can actually be just run straight through, what i mean by this is that minni boss thype encounters can simply be ignored for th most part and you can really just boss rush most of the game.That aside its really fun and enjoyable, should take you about 5-7 hours to complete but ng+ is fun too. Dont pay full price as its getting on a bit now but its well worh a play if its on sale.			",73,7,1,7,0,0,2

												I first played this game on xbox but when I saw this game was for 5$ on steam, I could not resist.You play as Starkiller, Vader's apprentice who is sent on various missions accomplishing your master's will.The story is the main strong points of the game. The first missions you are sent on assassination missions and unlike assassin's creed, you actually feel like you are hunting down your targets. However this is a personal story, Starkiller, Galen Marek's story. And without spoiling anything, I'll just say that the story is worth while. However I have to point out some of the dialogue: its not always good, some of it would need to be re-worked. Why? Because it can create strange plotholes, and while still using different words it could all be fixed. Such as ( i don't consider this a spoiler because it is right after the prologue but i'll cover it anyway)  After the prologue Starkiller pulls the lightsaber out of Vader's hand. Next cutscene Vader says: ""You were weak when I found you..."" This doesn't make sense. It could have been: ""Your training is nearly complete..."" or ""You are now stronger than you've ever been..."" and this would have fixed some of the dialogue  By having better dialogue you can have a better story.Graphics. You know what? They're not that bad mainly because this is a third person game, you don't get to see the textures from really close. But yeah, there are some textures that are low-res.  WARNING: THE GAME IS LOCKED AT 30 FPS However it can be fixed with an fps mod fix on pcgamingwiki.com . I played the game with the mod: I can't stand 30 fps. I recommend using an xbox controller since this is a port.Voice acting is good. However one issue: I got a bug on the first mission where I could not hear Juno's dialogue. I tried to find a fix for it but nothing worked so far.  Turn on the subtitles so you won't miss any dialogueFinally the gameplay. This is where I both like the game and dislike it. First of all this is what I like: Combos, you can unlock alot of combos in this game and the animations for it are really cool! You have to memorize combinations of attacks and there are enough variations to keep you invested in your 11-13 hours play through. You can unlock different types of lightsabers which provide different buffs and you can choose the color as well. This is awesome because you are not force to use the same lightsaber and you don't have to look at the same colors are well. You can chose the buffs and the color independently of each other. The movement system, this is where the game falters. It is not fluid enough, not responsive: you should be able to interrupt while you're in the middle of a combo, because when you're pressing X,Y,X,Y and you see a missile coming straight at you, well prepare to rage alot. This is my biggest problem in the game: sometimes you can't avoid dying. Most of the times when I died I could not do anything because i was in an animation, I could not avoid the danger. It feels like the game forces you to die occasionally. When you are locked in an animation you can take damage and there is nothing you can do. The worst issue is when jumping: and you get shot by a sniper or a rocket, you fall down and for some reason you slide on the floor for 30 meters. The problem is that it is an animation and you are locked in it so no matter what happens you can't get out of it. Some levels allow you to fall off the map and when you start to slide, you know five seconds ahead that you will die. Hopefully you understand why it can get really frustrating. And you might have to redo sections multiple times, not because you played on a hard difficulty but because you were extremely unlucky.Loading screens? I have to talk about them because they're bad. They can take a while to load 10-20 seconds and the worst part: WHY ARE THERE LOADING SCREENS INSIDE OF MENUS?!?The enemies could be a bit more varied, I don't mind slicing through hundreds of grunts but the mini bosses need more variations. Some enemies are really anoying such as the purge troopers. You have a lightsaber, you should be about to slice through them without a doubt, but this is an overall complaint in the game: lighstabers don't really feel like lightsabers when fighting against tougher enemies. I don't like also how some types clones can resist my force attacks, isn't the point of the game to unleashe the force on them?So overall I really like the game even with its flaws. To me it is an above average game with many flaws but you can still find enjoyment in it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good old fashioned fun! Star Wars fans will enjoy the additional story that gives depth and fills in some gaps from the original trilogy.  The game at this point (2/15) is polished and graphics look good. I encountered very few glitches - nothing game breaking. Storm troopers have a way of bouncing, clipping, and general glitching out when force thrown.  I run an 8 core dual 7970 rig so I can't speak for how smoothly it runs for every pc.  I will say the game gets very repetitive - very 'hack and slash' button mashing with linear maps. There are a few levels/boss battles that can be a little difficult but in my opinion break up the repitive levels.Overall fun, but gets repetitive.7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												How many times is the Emperor going to catch Vader trying to betray him and still just be okay with it? I realize that's part of the Sith dynamic but Anakin could at least try a little harder to keep it under wraps. I mean, Siddious went how long in the Galactic Senate working his way up and no one had any idea he was in league with the Dark Side? He's obviously a very calculating man who appreciates the big picture and knows what it means to move a plan forward in agonizing slow increments.The powers are a lot of fun to play with, reminded me a lot of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy but with all that meaty Star Wars lore to bask in, and the only grips I have are with the controls during some of the platforming.

												TLDR – Third person hack & slash similar to the Jedi Knight series, but you don’t get any guns, and it’s more fast paced. The game takes about 10 hours to beat the first time through and doesn’t have that much replay value.  6/10Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a console port that doesn’t seem to have been optimized for the PC (25 GB download!).  The controls are clunky (in some areas dangerously so) and the game’s menu screens don’t use the mouse. You navigate them with keyboard only, which is a clear sign of an incomplete console port.  Oddly enough, just navigation between different options in the main menu often has its own “loading” screens. The game’s story takes place between Star Wars Episodes 3 & 4, so it all happens a few years before the original Star Wars movie events take place. Darth Vader finds and trains a young apprentice, who he wants to eventually overthrow the Emperor with. Vader’s convoluted plan involves having his apprentice (named Starkiller) go around causing trouble and raising an army to fight Emperor Palpatine. It doesn’t make much sense to me if I’m being honest. Anyways, the moral is don’t trust the bad guys, they’re always stabbing each other in the back.You play the Sith assassin Starkiller in the third person perspective, similar to the Jedi Academy and Darksiders games, with your lightsaber being your melee attack, and the force as your ranged weapon. Lightsaber swings are very quick this time around unlike Jedi Academy, and your force powers are more limited, but they flow better in combat. All your force powers are offensive, so you don’t really have “buff” skills to power yourself up prior to fights (except the lightning shield which only lasts a few seconds anyway). Your most used attacks will be combinations of lightsaber swings and force push / force lightning. One of the noteworthy gameplay elements is the partially destructible environment in many areas. There is a lot of loose debris (or chunks that you rip off the walls) that you can use to throw at your enemies. Every time you kill an enemy you regen some of your life back, while your force power regenerates on its own (pretty fast too, so you can keep blasting). Along with the fact that you don’t use guns, this means that the only collectibles in the game are “force holocrons,” which can give you experience or lightsaber parts for customization. Each time you level up you get points to upgrade a few of your character’s skills or stats. Some holocrons give these skill points directly, while others give random bonuses. Holocrons are often hidden in out of the way areas or behind destructible walls, so throw force power around bountifully and be rewarded.Pros:+Expanded story for Star Wars fans, including the birth of the Rebel Alliance and an alternate timeline (DLC included in the Ultimate Sith Edition) where Starkiller gets all up in Luke Skywalker’s business.+Starkiller is extremely powerful, probably a lot stronger than any of the Jedi you have played in other Star Wars games. It’s good to be bad, and I’m considering changing my legal name to Starkiller.Cons:-The controls are often frustratingly clunky, especially when it comes to locking onto enemies for ranged force attacks. There’s also a section involving a star destroyer that might make you want to pull your hair out. It’s not that it’s a difficult section, it’s just hard to know if you’re doing it right your first playthrough, and it just drags on and on.-The game really is poorly designed for PC, the large download (compared to the sequel, which is like ¼ the size) and the odd menu format really stick out. Also, it might be a bug but I think you need an internet connection to launch the game. I lost my connection for about 15 minutes and found that I couldn’t load my saved game.-The boss fights can be frustrating because there really isn’t a tutorial on dueling and it feels like I’m missing something important (especially related to blocking).All in all, the game has significant problems but is worth playing through at least once for the story. Especially if you got this in the Humble Bundle and want to play part 2. I don’t think I’ll be playing through it a second time for a long while though. It just doesn’t bring too much to the hack slash genre. ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

												The question of, ""How can we take our epic story and nice characters in to the most glitchy console trasition possible?"" is finally answered. The story may not be too deep, but it is just the Star Wars feeling. It is also located in the Civil War time, not the Clone Wars timeline, which is a nice change from what the current Star Wars Universe gives us.But then there are the manymany things wrong with this game:The PC controls are very stiff, since my controller doesn't seem to be recognized by this game I played with mouse and keyboard. You can't aim your force with the keyboard, so you have to hope for the autolock. Almost unplayable. Once hit by a simple laser oder anything else, even a rock on the floor seems to be sufficient, you will be stunned for at least one second. Which of course happens again if you get hit in the meanwhile. I have lost countless battles against simple stormtroopers just because I could not move at all.Some other things that happened to me:- Getting should through a solid wall by two AT-ST, ending up in a stunlock -> death.- Getting killed during a cutscene.- Getting killed right after a cutscene, because I get replaced right in front of my enemy.- Falling of bridges because every melee attack seems to include a 2m step in front of you.- Getting tossed into a force field, stuck behing an object, therefore getting damage and die.- In the second half of the game I got no SFX from any other source than me. So all explosions were complete mute, and gunshots weren't traceable. Really annoying.The final thing is the locked camera in boss battles. Every bigger enemy locks the camera into place, so it's no longer a third person view but a bird kinda view. Except you cant look through objects you are hiding or stuck behind. Calculating an akle to strike back oder foresee a thrown objects path is almost impossible. Maybe this game is good on a console, it was fun as long as it was simple, but once you have to use advanced techniques, it got much worse.			",328,81,4,42,21,7,79

												I wish there was a rating in between ""recommend"" and ""not recommended"" here. The ""I recommend it"" goes for when the game is on sale... if you can get it for like 2-3 bucks, like I did while it was on sale, then go right ahead. Here is the reasoning behind this:- The game HAS some things going for it. You do feel pretty powerful, and throwing around big containers and stuff, causing explosions, force-throwing them into groups of enemies etc... all that is FUN. It really is. - However, there isn't much depth to it. It's basically hack, slash and force-throw stuff, kill everything that moves, and do the objectives. I can imagine that rather quickly, even with upgrades and unlocking more powers or stronger versions, the gameplay will become dull. - The graphics are ok. Keep in mind this game is a couple of years old. That doesn't bother me usually, so I don't mind that the graphics certainly aren't up to date.- However, the performance is... ridiculous. I played this on a system that can, without problems, run GTAV, Witcher III, MGSV, Fallout 4, AK, AC Unity at good to ultra levels. However, this game is so badly optimized (which might explain the 30 GB!!!) that even on that PC, even today, the framerate has frequent drops. I don't even WANNA know how bad this was back when the game was new, and I find it rather unacceptable to have such a bad performance from a, what, six year old game on a modern, decent PC. It's not game-breaking, but it's annoying how badly this performs several years after its release.So, my verdict:Pros:- Decent SW vibe to it (setting, graphics, force powers)- A lot of fun especially early on to throw stuff, blow open doors with the force etc.- Decently down force control system (throwing items)- graphics are ok for an older gameCons:- Lack of depth, both to fighting and to the story- Saberfighting is basically just spam a button type slashing. Other games have done this better- Terrible performance even today on a modern system that can run much more recent and much more advanced games more easilyRating: 6/10 if at sale, 4/10 if not			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pro:Looks decent for a 2009 game.You can throw things and people around. Con:Worst intro ever. You walk around at a languid pace, aiming at wookies and pressing E. Yawn.The ""story"" is an embarrassment.You're just some tool who goes around killing people, there's no character or motivation. You don't get to be 'evil'.Absolutely atrocious menus. You move through them using [ and ] (no joke).It's too tricky to pick up a specific object.It's also pretty much impossible to aim when throwing objects.The light sabre feels too weak.Force powers aside from throwing also feel weak.If you don't search for holocrons you will level quite a bit more slowly. Everything is 100% linear.There's basically nothing to the game aside from combat.Terrible boss battles, what is up with that static camera?ConclusionI really wanted to like The Force Unleashed. It gave the appearance of being a game where you can mess with people with force powers and be badass. Instead, it's a boring grindfest with dreadful combat, force powers that are interrupted as soon as you are hit and no personal input. This sits in stark constrast with Knights of the Old Republic. where you went your own path and could really mess with people (Zaalbar/Mission...). This game was the most disappointing Star Wars release since Episode 1.			",256,101,3,49,17,2,66

As a star wars fan it's enjoyable enough. The power fantasy and the story (even if it's not the greatest) is enough to keep you playing if you're into star wars. Otherwise, it's a mess.First of all... it's locked to 30FPS. There goes my interest huh? Well, not to worry, there's a fix.Only, if you use the fix, the game is more prone to chrashing (Which it slightly already is) and force gripping things will send them upwards when held. This doesn't happen in the 40FPS lock mode though. So I would recommend using that.Also,- Audio seem to be all kinds of broken. Music missing in places. No ambient noises in places. Background music loop not working right, causing the music to just stop. Even missing effects at some points.- Framerate problems at certain places. This is hardly a demanding game, yet in some places (epecially some bosses) there's bad slowdown in places, with the FPS dropping below 30. There was also a point when a portion of a boss was in slow motion for some reason (staying at 40FPS). And no it wasn't designed that way.- no combo breakers as far as I can tell. If an enemy starts a lightsaber combo and you get hit, there's no way to keep him from finishing his combo on you, unless it happens to have a very slow hit that allows you to speed away.Overall, it would be an average game in my books, if it wasn't for the glaring technical problems.With that taken in to account, I wouldn't recommend this unless you can get it for under 5$ and/or are a huge star wars nerd.

												**My hours played appear low due to a technical issue - you can read about this and other issues at the bottom of the review.**At the time of writing this review, The Force Awakens comes out tomorrow! I can't wait to see it. Since you're in the future, did you enjoy it? I'll bet you did. Is Luke a bad guy or something, what the hell is up with that? I hope he's in the movie for more than 5 minutes, or my future self is gonna be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Anyway. in the spirit of Star Wars enthusiasm, and since my Star Wars game reviews seem to be more popular than when I♥♥♥♥♥♥on Call of Duty games, I decided to cross this game off my backlog a short 7 years after its release.So does it hold up in 2015? Yes and no.Right off the bat, you can tell FU lacks the polish of the other titles I mentioned. Or the polish of any AAA game, for that matter. The first level has you fighting wookies who jump around platforms and fall off of them regularly, or trip over their own legs and have trouble getting up. The stormtroopers on your side of the battle get stuck in foliage and shoot in the wrong direction. (I guess in that sense the game is just like the movies.)FU is a hack-n-slash in a similar style to Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden, Metal Gear Rising, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, and God of War. Since I prefer those series based on gameplay, it's really the Star Wars branding that makes this game worth recommending to fans. The story is so-so, but the acting is well done and the characters are fun. Vader plays a central role and is voiced pretty convincingly, and the Emperor makes a few appearances. The show stealer is your sidekick droid though, who has been programmed to both help you and also cheerfully kill you in order to keep your senses alert. It's fun to have a friend around that's super excited about stabbing you to death. Another instance of good characterisation is a whacked-out Jedi recluse that has holed up in a junkyard. You fight him in a recreation of the Jedi Temple he built with trash, and you can Force-throw a scrapmetal version of Yoda into his face if you want. It's good stuff.The game's unfinished feel is in large part due to the physics engine, which is equal parts ambitious and poorly executed. You'll notice it in the first two minutes of the game, and it never changes. The wonky physics are a part of the fun factor though, since this game's MO is letting you create chaos by using a variety of moves and powers to overkill everything. It's not a tightly balanced combat sim, and I suspect that on harder difficulty levels it would lead to lots of frustration. Targeting enemies and objects is done automatically, so trying to grab one particular thing in a mob of action and then throwing it into another particular thing is oftentimes futile. Since the AI is generally stupid and your character vastly overpowered, it still remains fun to try out the generous amount of moves and combos at your disposal and watching the carnage ensue.This isn't to say that there isn't any strategy to the combat. Certain enemy types resist certain moves, so the game is pretty good at getting you to use your entire move set. It also rewards variety with bonus points, which in turn allow you to upgrade your character with new moves. In this sense it reminds me of the EXCELLENT and oft-overlooked FPS Bulletstorm (please go play that game, here, I'll make it obvious)*****BULLETSTORM***** ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it's the bestwhich is all about being creative with your killing. The combat is a little bit too repetitive, and there isn't a whole lot else to do besides kill things, but the game's 10 levels are both large and visually varied, which keeps things just interesting enough until the end. Plus, the boss battles throughout are well done.It's a shame that the PC port is so bad. There is a single graphics option - high quality 'yes' or 'no', and 'yes' still looks poor. Texture pop-in is very close, the game is locked at 30 fps, effects are sparse and cheap, and movement feels stiff. The visual style is what saves the presentation, with environments well detailed, lots of color, and a nice costume change occurring regularly for your character. Star Wars games have had a bad habit of looking very similar to each other despite the movies' frequent tonal shifts, and aside from an early Imperial location typical of Dark Forces and virtually every other Star Wars game in existence, this feels like a visually unique product.One note about lightsaber combat: it's meh. There is a greater emphasis here on power usage, and I had a much better time with the lightsabers in Jedi Knight II and especially Jedi Academy.Taken as a whole in these modern times, The Force Unleashed just feels rough around the edges. You can tell Lucas Arts is out of touch with the genre - your character frequently ""levels up"", yet has no level to speak of. A level up just gives you some points to invest in certain skills. The quick-time events that finish off bosses and certain large creatures are repetitive, lack impact, and just feel sloppy. The sound effects and/or music cut out several times in the later levels.And the set piece design feels just as unsure. Take this example - an early boss fight occurs inside an observation deck on a spaceship orbiting a planet. At one point the deck tears off the rest of the ship, inverts and begins plummeting down towards the planet, as you and your Jedi enemy fall to the domed glass roof. You can see the planet underneath you and the glass begins to burn and glow as you enter the atmosphere while the Jedi is Force-throwing various objects at you. On paper this sounds like a totally epic set piece, but due to a whole lot of factors, just winds up looking dull, even compared to the original God of War's opening hydra fight from three years prior. Lucas Arts are not the masters of these scripted sequences, and it shows pretty painfully.Bottom line is this: there's not a whole lot of impressive stuff in the game, but I give it a light recommendation because it's a casual experience that remains the only Star Wars game where you can stylishly demolish everything around you with a true feeling of power.TECHNICAL ISSUES:This is a bad port. It's locked at 30 fps, and you can't vsync it by traditional means.I ran the game at 2560x1440, which required opening the config file and manually adjusting the resolution. I recommend searching for config.xml in Windows, since different versions of Windows seem to stash it in different places.I also used Nvidia's control panel to force anti-aliasing and texture filtering which apparently aren't great by default.

												In this game you play as Starkiller/Galen Marek using the force to it's own limits. In the game it feels like you have full ccontrol of the force even  bringing down a stardestroyer . this game might not have the best story of all but it's amazing gameplay makes up for it's glitches and story. The game is overall awesome with all the skills you can use and i liked the  fact that you could become  Darth vader's replacement  amd the dlc levels too. overall 8/10			",114,9,0,13,2,0,1

												Introduction:Its the weekend before May the 4th which means its Star Wars weekend, and I’ll be looking at some of the Star Wars games over the next few days. The first being Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, it’s a hack and slash/platform style game that follows the story of Galen Marek. The story is based between the two trilogy and fills in some of the gaps in the story.Story:Galen Marek our protagonist is take by Vader as a child to become his secret apprentice, we meet him in the final stages of his training. The events that follow will change not only Galen’s twisted view of the world but also the course of galactic history. At least if Disney had left it as cannon, but never the less its a well written story and was written to be cannon at the time. So this means it ties in well and doesn’t try to change anything we know.Gameplay:The gameplay isn’t anything you haven’t seen before, its not going to blow you away. But it plays well enough and gives you an amazing feeling of power, Galen isn’t some bog standard Sith. He’s a Sith power house! he doesn’t open doors, he blows them to pieces with the force and that’s the same for all his powers. So no, nothing new and quiet repetitive but its amazingly fun too. What ever way you swing it, there’s something undeniably cool about bringing down a Star-destroyer down from the ground with just the force.Presentation:Now as with all older games, the graphic have aged. But there good, and the work that’s gone in to capturing Sam Witwer’s likeness is fantastic. And he’s was a great choice too as he’s a fan and it shows in his voice acting, he really did put the effort in. All in all its very well delivered and an enjoyable experience to play. The acting is good and the characters are likeable, but for me Proxy steals the show. Proxy is Galen’s loyal robot companion, but he is also programmed to kill Galen at any chance he gets. He adds a great amount of much needed humour to the story.See full review here http://cyberusuk.com/2015/05/01/star-wars-the-force-unleashed/ ",188,33,5,26,15,1,16

												Since its starwars its automatically a good game!All jokes a side this games pretty cool, It shows you a different side of things in the starwars galexy which is always neat to branch off from all the main story stuff. Any starwars fan would like this.I didnt say love because this game gets really repetitive its litterally the same thing over and over again.The regular enimies arent much of a challenge at all, And the boss battles arent the hardest  thing either.The only thing that really kept me playing the game was that  i wanted to hear more from the story line.Same mission after mission thing really lost me at times and i couldnt play this game for more then two hours in a row which sucks because i love starwars.If you are thinking of buying this game wait for a steam sale or somthing its not worth the regular price.

												Pro:Looks decent for a 2009 game.You can throw things and people around. Con:Worst intro ever. You walk around at a languid pace, aiming at wookies and pressing E. Yawn.The ""story"" is an embarrassment.You're just some tool who goes around killing people, there's no character or motivation. You don't get to be 'evil'.Absolutely atrocious menus. You move through them using [ and ] (no joke).It's too tricky to pick up a specific object.It's also pretty much impossible to aim when throwing objects.The light sabre feels too weak.Force powers aside from throwing also feel weak.If you don't search for holocrons you will level quite a bit more slowly. Everything is 100% linear.There's basically nothing to the game aside from combat.Terrible boss battles, what is up with that static camera?ConclusionI really wanted to like The Force Unleashed. It gave the appearance of being a game where you can mess with people with force powers and be badass. Instead, it's a boring grindfest with dreadful combat, force powers that are interrupted as soon as you are hit and no personal input. This sits in stark constrast with Knights of the Old Republic. where you went your own path and could really mess with people (Zaalbar/Mission...). This game was the most disappointing Star Wars release since Episode 1.			",256,101,3,49,17,2,66

												I enjoyed the Force Unleased, for a Star Wars fan, the combat was pretty satisfying when throwing around storm troopers with my force powers and then brutalizing them with my lightsaber. Though I have no real idea if this game is considered cannon or not in the Star Wars universe, it did actually explain a few questions, I had about the original trilogy (though some of the questions I never asked in the first place).  Though in the same respect this game also doesn’t quite fit into the Star Wars universe without causing some problems (not getting into it, it’s a game). So if you purchase this game what do you get? You get an interesting array of force powers, some satisfying boss battles, generally linear level design, and some nice bonus content. The voice acting in the game is well done so no complaints there. Therefore, if you are a Star Wars fan I suggest you pick up the game and give it a whirl, I do not think you will be blown away by it, but in term of entertainment, you will enjoy it. If you are not a Star Wars fan, it is hard for me to say, “Sure buy it” because in terms of content you can find a similar experience elsewhere.  ",92,11,0,19,10,2,16

												Play it for the story, stay for the ♥♥♥♥ed up audio in the last two levels, 30 fps lock (at least smooth with no studdering), and all around glitches.I've only played the wii version before this, and they are two quite different games with the same general storyline. (different developers). While this version has much better graphics than the wii version, it also comes with unforgiveable audio problems off and on in the last two levels that severely distract and detract from the game. Entire chunks of the game from the wii version are completely absent from this version, including but not limited to; both trips to the jedi temple, boss fights like the mandalorian, the gungan with one eye, customization of lightsaber hilts and a few others that I cant remember off hand. On the plus side you can get a darksaber, which is nice, which you cant get in the wii version for whatever reason.Buy this only if its on sale <$5 and if you can look past the annoying glitches.Personally, I like it, but you may hate it.

Definitely gave the feeling of being an unstoppable force on the battlefield. Audio was really good from the iconic sounds to the humorous radio chatter from the stormtroopers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A decent star wars character action game. However, the combat is pretty shallow and the enemy variety is lacking at  times. The first level of the game shows of a lot of destruction which is very sparse in the rest of the game. Sound design is also very lacking. Some of the early boss fights are fun as they are somewhat intense jedi duels. However the game seems to drop these later on until the final level. The game also has many clear port issues such as some sound effects not playing in some sections.5/10			",272,22,7,28,7,0,29

												The first sign that Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a mediocre port comes as soon as you boot up the game: you can’t navigate the menus with a mouse. On its own, this isn't an awful fact, but it's an omen of bad things to come. Aside from resolution and brightness options, there are no visual options to tweak. There is no antialiasing and no way to enable it. And frame rate troubles will haunt your every saber swing. It's too bad that so little respect was shown for the platform--and to those that will spend money on this product--because the underlying game is rather good. As Darth Vader's secret apprentice, you slice through grunting Rodians with your glowing lightsaber, go head-to-head with slobbering rancors, and punt jawas into the distance as if they were pigskins. You might be lucky enough to avoid this troubled port's technical flaws and experience the full pleasures of The Force Unleashed, but be warned: Picking up a copy of this physics-heavy action game is one gamble that may not pay off.

												Having just finished the game after ~10 hours of play, the game is short but enjoyable if you can manage to ignore some of the bad game design and the console port problems. I got the game as part of the Humble Bundle (cheap!) but I wouldn't buy it for full price.+Pros:+Enjoyable hack n slash+Fun Force abilities+Lots of different combos+Some impressive visuals-Cons:-Control scheme is ported from console version-Graphics are capped at 30fps and non customizable.-Game is a little bit short-All levels follow a linear path with cutscenes like a interactive movie.-Boss levels sometimes don't make much senseAs you can see, this game is average at best but if you are a Star Wars fan such as myself then you will enjoy it anyway.Right now I am looking forward to uninstall this game and install the sequel, Force Unleashed II, to get some more lightsaber and lightning fun!

												I'm going to assume you have some knowledge about this game, regardless whether you have played it or not. So, spoilers. Deal with it.You are Starkiller, Darth Vader's secret apprentice. But you never really feel like a Sith. Nor a Jedi. Starkiller seems a bit of a badass in-between character, with skills that hint at both.The story feels quite engaging, if you are into Star Wars. If you are a fan, you'll gleefully smile at the references, appearances and the style of everything.I'm not an expert, but all the locations truly feel like they are Star Wars planets. And Starkiller's outfit design that comes with every level is a notable feature too.Gameplay wise, aside the quirks an old game is expected to have, the game runs smooth. The cutscenes have frequent syncing hiccups, but it's easy enough to find them on Youtube and watch them with Overlay.While I really want to say the controls react perfectly, they don't...not really. There are many moments where an attack animation can't be interrupted, especially with a dash. Leaving you at the mercy of your foe (and their heavy attack)  whether you'll be punted away.If you aren't being thrown around, though, you'll usually have proper controls.The quality of the game is pretty nice, especially since Patch 1.2 comes with an HQ pack (comes with the installation). It's not super modern looking, but it's still pretty nice.With the Sith edition comes many new outfits, even from characters that don't or make a single appearance. Such as Proxy, Starkiller's ""assistant"" and training droid, turning himself into a holographic Darth Maul to battle-train him.Which was a tough fight, I'll have you know.The real fan service comes in the form of extra missions.The first one is from the old Jedi Temple, providing him with a small and personal adventure (in the shape of the Jedi Trials), showing Starkiller his ""possible"" future.Which possible future you may ask? You might already know this, but the main story end leaves you with a Light or Dark Side choice. Save your friends from The Emperor, or kill Darth Vader, whom you already had beaten right before that (but who seems fine to do it all over again).This is where things get interesting for the fans. The Light side choice (defeating Palpatine) is the canon ending. With Starkiller saving his friends, allowing them to start the Rebellion, and him dieing in what I consider a sense of sacrifice.But the Dark Side choice is pretty badass in on itself. Not only do you replace Vader, but a little 'incident' (which I won't spoil for you) causes him to be gravely wounded as well. Resulting in him being assigned a pretty unique helmet with a breather that sounds a little bit like that of Vader. However, his design is much more designed for Acrobacy, and he also has kept his limbs, so there's that.By the way, everything is unlocked in the extra missions, including all the lightsabre crystals, except for a few skills in the Jedi Temple one.This is the point where the other two extra missions take place. You are now the Emporer's enforcer as Vader was. One mission takes place in Tatooine, where you hunt for two familiar sounding droids... This has you passing by familiar characters, such as Jabba the Hut and Ben Kenobi, whom you have to kill, twice, in succession. Yeah, something about that spirit of his... The second mission, and my personal favorite, takes place in Hoth during the famous assault on the Rebel Base. Starkiller has donned an outfit similar to that of Darth Vader, but built for acrobacy and flexibility. In my opinion, it looks ten times more badass than that of Vader. And I don't say this lightly.But the real fan climax comes when you fight Luke for the second time. What happens there at the end gives so much fantasizing juice. Makes you feel bad that Lucas Arts didn't design a whole game around Starkiller taking the Dark Side.The game is old, and it shows. But the story is strong and the gameplay is fun, but tough enough. It's been quite the trip, and I can't say I've really regretted it at any point.			",467,55,7,42,17,3,37

The gameplay is repetitive, glitchy, feels like a bad console based movie tie-in from the 90s. This is not the Star Wars game you are looking for.

												I wish they did the prequel movies based on this game, great story and good characters. The QTE's are a bit annoying and detract from what's going on in the epic battles, but the force powers do make you feel like a Sith/Jedi. Great to see some cannon characters show up within the game and throughout the few words you get to see.			",94,8,2,15,4,1,4

												Extremely good game, it has addicting gameplay with fun upgrade systems and u can also play as fricken jango fett with a black lightsaber crystal. You get a decent long campaign and it comes with 3 dlcs which are really cool and relate to from the star wars movies and is just overall great. 8/10 better than the second one by alot but still reccomend both buying.(only buy the second force unleashed if its on sale like for the steam summer sale or winter sale)			",72,7,0,5,1,0,0

												This game has some insane difficulty spikes. Also the QTEs are not very fun.But using the force powers and the lightsaber combat can be pretty fun.Overall it's a pretty mediocre game. Only made better with some PC specific fixes, like being able to get 60FPS with a fix.If you like Star Wars, check it out for a cheap price. If not, there are way better hack and slash games out there.			",405,57,9,26,18,2,62

ETC.Jedi Academy was my favorite Star Wars game for years, now it's this one.I still don't get all those people complaining that they cannot launch this game. I think it's mostly new Win 10 user who are not enough tech savvy to do a few tweaks.The game it self runs right out of the box on my cheap, second-hand component built all AMD PC.May the Schwartz be with you!

 Flawless game, what flawless game? nah but honestly this is an amazing game. You go around fighting robots cutting off stormtroopers arms and whatnot. I really love the way you can force grip someone and fling them across the map or guide them into other enemys.This might just be my computer but the sky goes all weird and reminds me of when you don't have the right addons for gmod and the sky reflects what you look at on the ground. Does that make sense?The plot is alright, Darth Vaders apprentice takes down the rest of the jedi's and teams up with Vader to plot against the Emperor. Or is Vader using his apprentice?

												Let's get straight to the point:The Combat, which should be THE selling point, is clunky where the transistion between enemies or group of enemies becomes tedious with the bad auto-targeting system and no way to change your target other than sway the camera in hope to get locked on the right one. Blocking is pretty useless as you can only block if anyhting you've been previously doing has finished it's animation. So no quick blocks while swining your saber. You just take the hit and do not swing your saber. IF you decide to block - that's pretty much it: you're locked into palce and cannot perform any other action or move around while the AI is waiting for you to release the block-button and hit you. It is also common to lose 1/3 of your health when you get stunned and the animation of you getting up has to finish playing before you can get stunned again(especially when you have a wall behind you). There is more but I wanted to leave all the things out that might just be me not being good enough for the hardest difficulty and focus on the core mechanics being bad.So yeah, go buy Force Unleashed 2, it's been a while since I played it but I do not remember having any issues with it.

												I don't recommend this on PC. I played this originally years ago on a console system, and it was better suited there. This crapass port by a company who had no clue what they were doing, is just an insult and robbery. Their lack of support, or updates to fix any of the issues, is a good reason not to give them any money for their 'effort'.Worst issue: Its locked to 30fps, and if you try to unlock it (search for hack), it exhibits some very impossible glitches to work around. Most notable everything you grab flies upwards... making something already a difficult to control dynamic, much worse.The audio is one of the worst portjobs too, music plays only from the left speaker, and many sounds are either silent, or incorrect. Then lets not forget the last two levels are utterly silent. Seriously guys?Do not buy.			",116,22,2,5,8,0,9

But besides that I would recommend it, again the teachnical problems are just weird camera angels and missing audio (dialog and sound affects) but the dialog is so cringey I don't mind that very much. I give the game an 8.9/10. However this PC port gets a 7.2/10 becuase it's still my second favorite Star Wars game of all time, however they're still many teachnical problems.			",24,4,0,2,1,0,1

												Honestly, I loved this game at one point, and I wanted to still love it, but it's so BROKEN!Camera gets stuck in crappy area battle angles even after the boss battles and leaves me two inches in 3rd person from my character's face.Bosses Disappear randomly in the middle of battle and don't even reappear after a bathroom break and cooking dinner...the long way, like with time and care. So a LONG TIME, I have yet to have a boss re-pop up for me, which leaves me heart broken because I love Star Wars and if they took concepts of this game and put it into one of the new star wars movies, like super profound force abilites, I'd be happy with that, but this GAME gets a thumbs down for me, honestly I'm sorry, I love it for being it, but I truly judge it on being so broken that is has broken my heart.*Feels sad I bought the star wars collecton pack, hope The Force Unleashed 2 isn't as broken*Also anyone please leave comments on which game from the Star Wars Collection I should play next! Can;t wait to play them all, so hard to choose!			",90,23,1,12,5,0,7

												Star Wars action game with a lot of flaws. For Star Wars fans, I would recommend this game if you can get it for a cheap prize. Some levels and scenes are just too awesome to miss (tearing down a Stardestroyer with the force) and hey I killed Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi! If you are not a Star Wars fan at all, you will get a action game with too many flaws to justify buying this game.			",176,27,1,11,8,1,26

												If you are a Star Wars fan, then you WANT to play this game, and you WILL play this game, and you'll LOVE it. Well... actually... part of it. You are also going to HATE it. A lot.This game could be so much more, but it fails on so many levels, I can't really recommend it. The only positive thing in this game the Star Wars universe. It's good to be in this universe, even if it is by this terrible game.Music/sound glitches; simple, stupid, sometimes incoherent story; a whole lot of QTEs; and below average boss fights. STILL, if you are a big Star Wars fan, you'll enjoy some of it. You are going to hate every problems with this game, but you STILL want to finish it...So I only recommend this game, if you are a big Star Wars fan. Otherwise, you should avoid this title...

												I would like to say YES YES YES YES buy it now, but i can't for one HUGE reason the port. This game is fantastic using force powers is an absolute joy. Its nice to play a game that makes you feel all powerful, but the pc port for this is utter garbage. It is only available in the Ultimate Sith Edition which in and of it's self is fine until you look at the space requirements 30 gigabytes is excessive. it would be better if we were given the option of downloading the base game and the DLC seperately, but since its sold together in the Ultimate Sith Edition that isn't an option. also LOADING SCREENS BETWEEN MENUS WTF and they arn't short either. and when it comes to graphics requirements it ♥♥♥♥s up too. Granted i have an integrated graphics card so it's no suprise it isn't very powerful, but it is hooked into a core i7 mobile processor (bout as powerful as a Core i5 desktop) and technically runs the game at a decent frame rate (by which i mean 20-30 FPS), However anything beyond about 10 ft from the character doesn't render. due to lack of any real support from the now dead Lucas Arts this problem will never be fixed. so if you have an integrated graphics card, but you think you may have a shot at running it just forget it it won't work properly.

												If you want more Star Wars after The Force Awakens, if you want to feel the power of the dark side by sending your ennemies flying, chocking them or electrifying them... then as a hack-n-slash initially released in 2008 on consoles, The Force Unleashed does it pretty well.  I trully believe the too many bad reviews on Steam hide the fun this game can be.  I owned the game on console and liked it then.  Also, I think that I have seen enough of he PC version to write this review.Strengths:-Your character is Darth Vader's secret apprentice-how cool is that?- his skins and idles are sick!-The story is an interesting (yet not necessary) part of the Star Wars lore-I like the control you have on the telekinesis power.  The physics when you grab people and they jerk around are addicting-The combo system and the various powers are fun and rewarding-Some graphics are nice for a game from 2008 and true to the movies-Action packed, no dead time besides the cut-scenesYou will find many exhaustive lists about the flaws of this game, but to me the main ones are as follow:Flaws:-Clunky controls/aim -Repetitive action-Quick time events were a big thing back then but they are not always a good thing-Besides faster loading screens (that improvement was really needed), the PC port brings little more to the table, thus remaining below expectations			",101,11,2,12,4,1,1

Some people say this game sucks, but I think its amazing, sure the story is not great but that does not change how fun it is to launch a jawa across the map with the force. My pros and cons.Pros:+ Very fun+ Feels good to use the force and lightning+ Feels bad♥♥♥♥♥to be a sith lord and kill every loved character (Obi-wan, Boba fett, Luke, ect.)+ Can be C-3P0 with a lightsaber+ Customize your lightsaber to your needsCons:- Can get a bit repetitive - Quick time events look cool but are still only quick time events- Sound has a chance to go out in last 2 levels (there is a mod to fix this)- Story is not amazing- Voice acting can be...not very good at times.My over all rating is a 7/10.

												Having never played this game before I was excited to see it on the Steam winter sale event, unfortunately this is a console port and a lazy one at that.  The game is unplayable.  Some people have no issue but for most you get a 'hall of mirrors' effect/motion blur if you're not looking at the ground or a wall inside of a building.  I am playing the sequel with not current problems but this game is heavily referenced and I have no clue who these characters are or about the story.

												As a long time Star Wars fanatic, I would reccommend this game to anyone. But, I would not reccommend purchasing The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith Edition from steam. The graphics are great in high detail and the gameplay is fairly simple. The downfall with this edition from steam is in game, it is almost unplayable due to the background motions and scenes during gameplay are distorted, making it impossible to look up at the sky or space. Random ships or obstacles will be duplicated ten-fold until you can no longer see. With this in mind, this is a great game and I still play it with the background bug, but if you want a clean, less buggy edition, I suggest buying it elsewhere.			",144,24,0,12,13,1,12

												I was hoping this would be like the excellent Jedi Outcast or Jedi Academy games but it is nothing like them. This is a buggy console port with clunky controls, a god awful camera, and unsatisfying combat.The controls are bad with either keyboard/mouse or controller. General movement is much better with a mouse and the camera actually works fine with mouse, but doing combos and especially moving/throwing objects with force grip is easier with a controller (though still clunky). Force grip in this game is kind of important. There are always objects around you to grip and throw at enemies or grip enemies themselves. You also need to grip and manipulate objects to progress which is much harder to do with a mouse. Some moves and combos require you to press two buttons at the same time, one particular move requires three buttons, which are far easier to do on a controller. Also my mouse sensitivity became super high when I gripped light objects which made throwing them accurately next to impossible. So I'd recommend using a controller as it's less bad. However, with a controller that leads to the next problem...The camera. It's the worst. It doesn't work properly with controller. It consistently fails to rotate to where you're facing when you turn. You have to manually do it yourself ALL the time. Having to rotate the camera when you're in the heat of battle is annoying. Actually, having to turn the camera anytime is annoying. I don't know why it works fine with mouse but not with controller but it's irritating as hell. Then you get to the combat and it becomes repetitive and frustrating especially with the poor controls. Turning is more inaccurate with a controller so you'll miss your targets a lot more when using force powers. I said earlier that using force grip is easier with controller but actually focusing on the object you want to grip can be a challenge because you have to be looking right at it which is harder to do with a controller.  In later levels you will constantly face off against a bunch of enemies (at the same time) that can resist your force powers, snipe you, use homing rockets, stunlock you while everyone shoots you, and it just becomes a chore. You can get knocked down with a rocket and it takes like three seconds to get back up for some stupid reason and someone else fires a rocket right as you stand and you're knocked down again. Suddenly you don't feel like such a bad azz sith anymore. There are also quicktime events when fighting stronger enemies and bosses, because timed button presses are always fun and exciting and never get old. You can't save in the game. The game has a save button but it doesn't work. You only have checkpoints and sometimes they're poorly placed and right before a cutscene so if you die you gotta watch it again and again because the cutscenes are unskippable. Sound/voice is also missing from some levels. Even using the recommended fix doesn't solve it. I had to copy the sound files from the disc version of the game (don't ask me how I got it) and transfer it to the game's folder to actually fix it. Great job devs. Oh yea it's also locked at 30fps. You can download files to raise the fps but it causes issues with the force grip movement which is already bad enough. The 3 bonus levels you get with the Ultimate Sith Edition (accessible after you finish the main game and start a new game) aren't anything special. It's more of the same and the storyline is completely absurd for two of the levels. Just to give you an idea, in one level you have a saber battle with Obi Wan when he's a ghost. Yea that's a thing.This is another bad console port with underwhelming gameplay. Save yourself time and frustration and give it a pass.			",498,196,18,38,17,7,23

The game is so choppy that it's literally unplayable. After spending hours trying to find fixes, I found an FPS unlocker that helps ""somewhat"", but it's still awful.

												This game is one of the biggest letdowns i've ever had the misfortune of buying. Ever since the Force Unleashed came out, I've read the books and have 3 different versions for 3 different systems (nintendo ds, psp-3000, and the Wii). The other three versions I bought were pretty nice (+rep to those devs), but this looks like another rushed and botched pc port; which has become all to prevalent these days.Pros:     - None, all three other force unleashed I've owned are far superior in every way (Wii was the best)Cons:     - Horrible physics engine      - Numerous game crashing bugs (primarily in boss battles, which make them the worst timing)     - Can't move around in the Rogue Shadow      - QTE's don't always specify whether the button needs to be mashed repeatedly or just tapped once     - Enemies are FAR too difficult even on normal     - Save system frequently corrupted after trying to reload it     - 30 FPS frame cap, causes slow rendering and screen tearing (I have a GTX 960 so this shouldn't be a problem)     - Not holding to the actual book in many respects, like on the scrap planet you have to move an entire destroyer        but the ""Ultimate"" edition assumes that's too unrealistic i guess (even the ds version had the destoyer part lol, so                                     can't  blame it on system limitations)My advice is, get it on any other system, NOT on pc. 3/10 ",110,7,2,4,5,1,1

Unfortunatley this game was just not made for PC its controls are so slow and horrible and I couldn't even keep going past the first level.  I've been told using a controller helps but I have not yet tried myself.If you have a console I would fully recommend buying the game on that, but don't bother with the PC version			",18,3,0,6,0,0,8

 Game could not be fully reviewed for major technical issues: This title is a poorly realized and optimized console porting. The lack of quality in doing said port brought upon PC players a plethora of serious technical problems, such as:===- 30 FPS cap, can be removed by editing files, but doing so will majorly increase chances of game crashes.- No support for resolutions higher than 1920x1080. Can be forced via editing of files but it will likely break the interface and give problems during cutcenes and transitions.- No anti aliasing option, can be forced through driver, but guess, it will improve chances of crashes.- Consistent audio problems in various sections, i.e. audio coming from wrong sources, being disturbed, being in some mono / stereo likewise playback even on a 5.1 system.- Clunky and unresponsive control system makes performing quick actions a real pain.-  And most of all, overall game stability is crippled beyond saving. Crashes happen quite often, if i must speak for my personal experience, the game crashed 8 out of 10 times on player death, resulting in massive frustration and time waste. === AVOID puchasing for PC, Mac or any other computer-based OS.

You get to genocide the Wookie planet playing as Darth VaderDark side points:1. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls2. Repetitive and easy to play levels3. Bad Ai and unbalanced bosses4. Bugs concerning invisible soldiers that hit you without spawning5. Really short game (you can easily finish it in 6 hours if you do a speedrun)6. Disappointing ending boss fightsThis game could have been great, if not for all those things i mentioned earlier. For its current price, i wouldnt recommend it to anyone, except hardcore Star War fans. If you wanna enjoy a star wars action title better buy something else for the same amount of money, or w8 for steam price cuts.  ",108,7,3,19,4,0,23

												The Force Unleashed is a polarising game of its time. Duels and force powers feel excellent, this is easily one of the best combat systems that the LucasArt team have ever created. Sadly things become repeditive far too quickly. Most enemies and mini-bosses are recycled to no end and cheapen the gameplay. It's such a shame considering how impressive the artstyle and level design is in each area. It's easy to get bored quickly without anything new or exciting ever happening.The story is tacky and pointless, which is a real dissapointment for its premise and how on point other star wars games have been in this regard. The best way to enjoy this game is through the cheat codes, which allow you to play as almost any character in the entire movie franchise and force unleashed. As a sandbox game for combat and force powers it can give you some hours of fun. But these features don't excuses the plentiful amount of issues the game has. If you're going to buy it, the DLC missions are the best ones by far. They include interesting gameplay mechanics and great what if scenarios. If the game itself was more like the DLC offered we could have really had something special here.			",388,95,9,67,29,5,24

												This is an action game, remiscient of Castlevania. You spend most of your time in combat and in jumping around and manipulating objects. You can learn may different combat moves, most associated with complicated button press sequences. I don't have great hand-eye co-ordination, so I'm not a big fan of action games, but thought I might be able to do this on the easiest setting. I was wrong. What makes things particularly frustrating is that when you save and reload, you do not come back to the same point, but to the beginning of the section. So if you die near the end of a long, difficult section, too bad - you have to do it all over again. Much of the time you die not in combat, but by missing a tricky jump, or being knocked off a ledge. After 8 attempts to cross the chasm halfway through the second mission, I gave up.

												This is a shining example of a console port done wrong. The controls feel awkward with a keyboard and mouse, and are often downright frustrating (Lightning goes through the legs of an ATST but you aren't actually hitting it), boss battles for some reason force you into a different camera perspective and are generally more frustration than fun, and there are way, way, way too many quicktime events. In fact, you can't kill most large enemies without executing one. They aren't difficult, but they aren't especially fun, either. Further, the characters are bland and uninteresting, the main character is a gigantic Mary Sue, and there are many ridiculous aspects (breathing and talking in vacuum, a shapechanging, Force-using droid??????) that make it hard to stomach. The enemy types are not all that varied; in fact, very few require you to change tactics to deal with them. In conclusion, don't waste your money.			",116,15,0,25,10,0,19

												Badly designed junk. For a game as obsessed with looking cool and precise manipulation as this one is, it has to have a better camera and control scheme to work. The controls seem to want the micro-second pixel-by-pixel precision of classic arcade games, but the engine has response lag and the controls are way too sloppy to do things in less than one character height. The auto-target is ... bad is the only word, constantly locking onto things off screen instead of the foe centered in your view. The controls can only be adjusted before you start playing, and the tooltips in game use the default control scheme anyway.The camera is a kludgy mess. It pans around randomly, does not line up for you to be aware of the bottomless pit you're about to step into, and refuses to follow enemies even during boss fights. Boss fights get their own camera angle, altering the basic camera behavior from ""behind the character"" to ""cinematic overview"", without adjusting the control scheme for the altered perspective.Fights with large foes will suddenly become quick time events for ""cool kills"". Unfortunately, you're so busy with the timing that you can't appreciate the cool thing you're supposed to be doing. Thus, these ""cool moments"" exist in my memory as random button icons flashing on a screen.The story is bland, and spoiled by the ""sat on main menu too long"" in-game trailer.The characters are shallow and predictable.Bosses randomly, and with no indication of when, become invincible while fighting. This seems to last for three to five seconds, and is most common when the player begins to get a series of successful attacks chained together.TL;DR: Bad. Don't buy it. If you get it for free, don't install it.			",122,17,0,24,5,0,6

												Seriously, the designers of this game should be ashamed. The gameplay is frustrating and you do nothing more than using fancy force powers and hitting guys with your saber. You have to do some movements to kill some mini and major bosses that if you miss one of them (in the less than 0.5 seconds) you have to repeat it all over again.The story is so stupid, that I don't even know how George Lucas aproved this, or if he does even know about the tragedy that this game is. Pardon my language, English is not my mother language. To every Star Wars fan, don't buy this piece of crap!			",136,10,1,6,9,2,15

												It has a lot of issues for a high end title like this. The animations are slow and buggy as hell. Force gripping works about half the time because your character locks onto something else instead of the guy you're trying to fling across the room. The sound issues are an easy fix on Steam/Aspyr's end yet it hasn't happened yet. That is pretty immersion breaking when the game cutscene is completely inaudible because it's so broken. The story is fairly interesting but it doesn't make up for this game falling into the same limited gameplay so reminiscent of hack and slash titles with very few positives like it's peers. Ninja Gaiden and Devil May Cry dump buckets on this as far as fluidity of gameplay.			",165,26,5,16,23,0,20

												The game runs fine! A lack of settings may make it unfriendly to some older PCs, but most will be fine. I've got a 4 gig Nvidia GPU and a 2.4 GHz cpu and the game is running perfectly fine! I played it frequently on the 360, and the same old gripes still stand. Platforming is awkward as gravity has more attraction to your character than two rabbits in spring. Missing one jump might cost you a solid 15 minutes of gameplay. Terrible force controls also make for some accidental self-damage on occassion. Honestly, the draw of this game is in how much fun it is to be Starkiller. Ripping the environment apart to obain objects to chuck into Jawa's faces will never get old. It's not great, but it is fun.			",523,62,6,58,21,0,32

												The reason why I don't recommend this game is because this game is from the old era of games where gimmicky combat was all about the player either being lucky or exposing some of the cheaper elements of the game in order to triumph. There are many other choices to make if you support consoles, but unfortunately as a PC user most of the third person action titles with a camera that isn't isometric seems far away from ever happening because of PC being a secondary platform, and because most PC gamers prefer using a keyboard. Games like dragons dogma, dark souls, skyrim, devil may cry, dynasty warriors, toukiden, and eventually God eater and for honor, seem to be the only few types of run around jump action titles that exist with melee combat on the PC genre. However, all of those games have mechanics that will actually support your playstyle, this does not.Some examples of these bad elements include bosses endlessly countering attacks, randomly losing 40 percent of your health from attacks, missing with your sith thunder attack, faulty attack priority, getting locked into enemy combos, slippery slopes while exploring, bad camera angles, cutscenes everywhere, and a throw system that trumps the combat system because of the ai. Granted, games of this time have always been full of gimmicks when choosing the hardest available difficulty, however, in action games, it's almost necessary to do so to enjoy the variations of combos the game has to offer. Though the ai makes a point to walk through half of your combo to the point where it feels like you're playing a dragon ball z game, and it's almost an implicit need to throw and blast everything rather than even try to punch anything. That's a big no no if you're trying to make an action game... it'll end up being like dragon age... where mages and archers destroy the game for any type of melee. Moreso with the latter. It's not a bad game though... the visuals, movement, enemies and effects are still a strong point, the visual fluidity and normal difficulty pacing in the game makes for some of the more fast and curious platform games I've played in the past and adds action from other games that lack the speed or traversal appeal that this game boasts. It's one of the main reasons I've bothered picking it back up despite already playing through most of it on 360. But despite how much I do like the game after I bench some of the more irritating elements, I would never recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fair and honest challenge. Because let's face it, outside of exploration, the main reason for playing it is to kick butt Jedi style. Not kicking yourself for the game being too cheap to play how you want.

												The Force Unleashed is a miracle of bad game design. Poor explanation of controls? Check. A tutorial (for throwing stuff with the Force, at least) that comes after the prologue level? Check. Bosses- and regular enemies- that can block attacks, knock you down, use attacks that you can't avoid or block, and make you forget all those neat combos in favor of button-mashing? Check. Seriously, one of the later levels gives you two or three purge troopers (who can knock you down), an AT-ST (which can also knock you down) and an assortment of stormtroopers (who can't knock you down but will constantly interrupt you by shooting you). Any difficulty above Apprentice, on which I still got killed by the aforementioned spam, is unthinkably nightmarish during or after the second boss. Not that the second boss is ever anything but.There are also insultingly pointless quick-time events. You're given a surprisingly long window for each button press, and if by some perverse miracle you press the wrong button... either you can immediately initiate the QTE again or, if it's in a boss fight, you just get to press the right button. I failed to press X at a moment when doing so would prevent Starkiller from being fatally beaten in a saber lock... and I was just asked to do it again as the saber lock continued. Just let me kill the boss and watch the finisher or something. Sheesh.The camera is rather irritating to control, though in my experience that's nothing new. Some people have complained about the fact that most of the boss fights have  a fixed camera, and while I understand that it's annoying, I'm actually somewhat glad that for once I don't have to bother with rotating the camera.  You can lock on to enemies, though, so that's a plus.The game also only has three tilesets. We see Kashyyk in the prologue and in the story proper, we go to Felucia (how I hate Felucia) twice, and two different planets have the junkyard tileset. There might be more instances of this, though. I haven't finished the game.To try to tie together the disparate complaints in this review, let me tell you about my favorite area in the game: a certain open area on Felucia. It's a clearing with some islands of foliage and weird tentacles that react violently when you shock them (this is probably meant to help you clear out enemies, but it didn't seem too helpful to me), loads of obnoxious Felucian warriors, some large, explosive fruits surrounding the clearing, and not one, not two, but THREE Rancors.Quick rundown of Felucians: they have bone swords with forcefields that can block your attacks, they have forcefield shields that can block your attacks, they have shamans that can render them invincible, and they have another variant that shoot lasers at you from a staff. There are, as I mentioned, loads of them in this particular stretch of jungle, and they make it nearly impossible to take the necessary time to grab and throw fruits at the Rancors. They also seem to spawn continuously, though I could be wrong about that. Note this: the rushed, out-of-touch or downright sadistic people who made this game give the player an efficient means of dealing with the dangerous enemies in an area and then make that means essentially useless. I had to downgrade from Sith Lord (regular) difficulty to Apprentice (easy) to get through that area. At the point in the game I'm at the player is frequently pit against AT-STs, which are essentially Rancors that can consistently hit from a distance, and either not given any obvious throwables (not that they help against an AT-ST in firing range) or mobbed with stormtroopers.This is all very tragic, really, because TFU had the potential to be a good game. There are points in the game where I've felt like the overpowered Sith I'm supposed to be, but these are few and far between when all sorts of enemies can block my lightsaber, force push or lightning and then repeatedly knock me over.

												If you like action games with fancy wrapping and some plain fast action, maybe it's the Star Wars game for you. Despite its good looks and high initial potential and a rather good story, I concluded that it is not for me.Maybe I had too high expectations as a console fan friend recommended this one to me as one of the best Star Wars games around and Lucasfilm games always had an excellent pedigree in my book. I started that universe in a cockpit of an X-Wing ages ago and shot all the way through Tie Fighter and X-Wing Alliance. They were extremely challenging, more often than never, but they also were games of reason and consequence, higly addictive. Then I had some deep RPG experience with the amazing KOTOR games. I also had some strategy fun with Empire at War, not to mention the super amazing Republic Commando that is one of its bests in its category even since in my opinion.The closest to The Force Unleashed is Jedi Knight 2 and Academy that had much more depth, better controls on PC and just better overall game dynamics (yes I'm talking about a decade-old game). Damn, even LEGO Star Wars was bigger fun. Er, well, actually, that was fun. It is the fun factor where this game fails to deliver. There are issues with controls and camera movement that makes defeating simple obstacles and fights plain annoying at places. Not to mention certain long, annoying boss battles and the feel of repetition. On the long run, these together decreased the fun to the point where I just lost the inspiration to play it again after finishing the story. It could be much more but at the end of the day I can consider this one to be a moderately annoying, flat action game. With an ample of unused potential.The other thing that I did not like is just because of a little phylosophy. I am a demoscene musician specialised on ancient 8-bit machines like the C64 and I'm lucky to work with coders and graphicians who can pack an insane amount of content into tiny spaces: 64kilobyte or even 4KB (that is about the size of some text on a sheet of paper), running real-time on average machines pumping out 50+FPS. This is one of my fav 64KB PC demos, released in 2006 by demo group Conspiracy:


YouTube™ Video: conspiracy  -  Chaos Theory [HD] 

			Views: 76,575		

			C O N S P I R A C Y presents C H A O S T H E O R Y at ASSEMBLY 2006 /// Brought to you by: BoyC - main code Gargaj - synth code, music Zoom - visuals /// About the intro: Apparently we finished...		

Everything here, the visuals and music are generated real-time by 64 kilobyte of program data. That means the size of  text of 16 sheets of paper, one-side printed.That means, the great majority of the data and processing that you have in a game could be much much more efficient - but it's not efficiency that it is all about these days. If it was, your downloads would be much smaller and even the slowest machines could pump out 30FPS. The solution for better gaming experience was not buying faster and bigger computers but write more efficient program codes.Still, there are game developers who create artistically coded engines that are efficient. For example I really admire Runic Games, Bethesda or Valve for their game engines as they have awesome content / performance ratio. As for the measure, Skyrim with all the extensions installed, opens a 20+ square miles of gaming world and can give you 200+ hours of entertainment with as much as 9GB of data. Just Cause 2 creates 200 square miles of game space that you can roam and the game doesn't lose its sparkle after many hours. It uses less than 5GB space on your HDD.So, 25GB of data for a game that can be completed in less than 10 hours (and at least 2 hours of them are annoying boss battles) and completely loses the momentum afterwards? Gimme a f'n break...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nope. First of all you have to download a patch/mod or whatever to get it to run at 60fps, that's kind of annoying but not a gamebreaker. In fact other than the fact that it's just not aged well there isn't really one. Supposedly there are sound and crashing issues somewhat in abundance but I didn't get any of those in my short time playing it. Instead I got to the second level and had to raise a platform that simply wouldn't go high enough for me to jump and dash over to the other side. It either kept getting stuck or they just expect you to make that jump on wishful thinking and childhood dreams. It was at that point I just gave up. I completed it once yonks ago and loved it, playing it now it's just not fun. Certainly not £15 worth of fun.			",182,19,8,8,1,1,4

												So I bought this game in the hopes that it would be as good as it looked. I was sadly mistaken. The ""reaction"" controls sometimes ignore you. Enemies can spam attacks that can you cannot block or avoid. Boss fights sometimes feel unwinable just because they have unblockable mechanics that can take almost all of your health before it will allow you to move again. To top it all off whenever I open the game it causes my other monitor to go black and become unusable while the game is running. It could be a good game but it wasnt tested/ troubleshooted enough.

												it's basically like a God of War Game but star wars and the story is the opposite of Anakin's 10/10i can see people don't like my review so here's how i see it ive played this when i was younger and loved it but what really made this game fun to play was with a controller pc controls for this game are terrible and yes the fps is locked at 30fps but it's really easy to make it 60fps just click here to fix that i 100% promise it works and 100% promise it's safe. but what really makes this game awsome to me is the story.http://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/506-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-12-fps-cap-fix/ ",56,4,0,19,1,0,0

												I just rage quit this game. Not because its hard or I can't beat it. It's because now, no matter what i do, half the sound effects wont play. Surrounded by the empire, fighting off the silent blasters and inaudible tones of battle. All that is heard is the soft battle music and the quiet footsteps of my enemies. The first few levels were fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic but suddenly, without warning, this level can't be heard. There were numerous glitches and overall ♥♥♥♥-ups throughout the game none quiet as frustrating as a silent empire. I checked my settings. I restarted. I fought for rebellion and god dammit, they let me down. Do i like this game? YESDo I reccomend you play it on PC? NOI play this game a few years ago on the Wii of all machines. It played great but i think some levels varied quite a bit. I do know that a lot of the mechanics were tossed away from the Wii version. As is, the game feels like it's missing a lot. I leave it now as I did when first played it: disappointed. All though the idea of the Force being unlimmited is trying to beconveyed in the game, it doesn't deliver. Starkiller is great and cool but they didn't do him justice in this game. I would love to see this remade.  ",113,16,0,21,6,1,1

												Started playing for the story line because I played the second one first. Started off okay but the delay in some keystrokes wasn't a problem, yet. As you get further and acting quickly becomes nescessary the delay ends up with you getting knocked around and eventualy in a corner dead. I don't find it fun watching my character become a bullet cushion and no amount of dodging or blocking be so ineffective. Also the sound cuts out whenever it feels like it. Uninstalled.

												I remember playing this back when it was released originally and i don't think i enjoyed it much back then either. While the story is somewhat entertaining and the graphics hold up very nice even to this day or finally i'd say, now that we have the hardware to actually run it w/o problem haha. Make sure to get a fps unlocked .exe though or your eyes will start to bleed.Now to the bad ... the game is very hard and unforgiving ... now .. not hard in a ""oh you newb you just don't know how to play  lolol"" , no , not like that, but in a ""oh you didn't time that jump perfectly"" or ""oh no you actually can't jump here now you die falling down the abyss and then we let you restart from before the last boss battle ... again"" kinda way. Also it has some weird difficulty spikes, which really make you wanna (or do make you do lol) ragequit sometimes. Actually, i got so frustrated about the stupid ways you can die in this game. Last time i died,  i was stuck and stun locked in an explosion and little by little all my life went away and i died .... and had to redo the  whole area again ...To sum it up :Combat is a chore.Boss fights are either♥♥♥♥♥♥easy (if you know which attack to spam lol) orBoss fights are impossibly hard (if you don't know which attack move or force etc to spam).Movement (and by that i mean jumping) is a PITA.Normal combat (i.e. not vs bosses) is either easy as pie or bugged as hell ,like not doing damage against something, without any indication of why ... and i am not talking enemies that can block blade attacks or are ""immun"" to the force, but enemies that are just not taking damage, period.Frustrating progression. It's just one big grind to reach the next cutscene (do yourself a favor and just watch them with a bik player lol).Feels like work ...do NOT recommend ...PS : played with a xbox controller			",256,34,3,46,34,1,63

												The Force Unleashed is a third-person hack-and-slash game that is about going from the start of the level to the end.You can upgrade your Force powers and get more abilites as you slay more and more enemies, but most of the time, the extra abilities and combos are meaningless. You can just run around pressing the same attack button over and over to kill most enemies. Press the Force Lighting button every so often for a ranged attack, and then use your Force abilities to clear the way to move on in the level.This game is neither deep, nor is it particularly fun. You would really only play it because you want to see story that essentially considered cannon in the Star Wars universe.5/10 ""Mediocre""			",97,38,1,24,4,3,12

												So I bought this game because it was one of the few SW games I hadn't played yet. Heard some good things about it, and it looked decently fun. After all, to me it was Star Wars and that's all I really cared about. Oh boy if only I'd known what I was getting myself intoRight off the bat the first thing I bump into is a bug with the audio. Throughout the game the sounds are glitched and sometimes they don't play. I can get past this, save for the fact that there's no quality to the rest of the game. This has hands down one of the worst combat systems I've played in any other action game. Nevermind the button mashing, as I didn't expect something of the quality of DMC3 with this game. I just wanted a game that was fun to playBut it's not. The gameplay is terrible. The combat is slow and clunky, you get knocked down every single time and have to wait until your character clunkily regains his balance, all the meanwhile he can keep receiving damage. The force powers are underwhelming and they're awkward to use due to the terrible nature of the camera and the controls. The platforming is terrible due to how badly designed the movement system is as there is no proper collision detection and you just slide off round invisible surfaces as if this were a PS1 game. All bosses are gimmicky and a pain to fight. Since you fight them in arena-shaped areas, the camera view completely changes and now it sits far away from you. Instead of following your character so that you know how you're oriented and can properly move around, the game instead pans out and you have to clumsily move around completely disoriented. The targetting system for using your powers on bosses is completely useless and you have a hard time actually locking onto your target. The areas are filled with hazards that you need to constantly move around or else you're thrown around like a ragdoll losing huge chunks of health at every turn. Combine this with the terrible combat system and the clunky movement and you've got a recipe to disasterThe levels all have been a bore so far due to how you can abuse your force powers to destroy everything instantly, or whenever you're faced with overwhelming odds you can always just find a way to cheese fights because the AI is braindead. On top of that the game looks ugly and bland, and you can't even appreciate the cutscenes due to the aforementioned audio problemsOverall I wouldn't recommend this game at all. Luckily I got it during the holiday sale, but even then I still regret ever purchasing it			",11,2,0,2,0,0,5

												I expected more from the PC port of this game but sadly it has disappointed me. The PS2 and PC ports are much better despite not having the bonus DLC's. Keystrokes are always delayed in this game. Mission objectives are confusing since they    are not updated from time to time. Cutscenes are also sensitive even to the slightest press of a keyboard button. In sum, its predecessor is definitely better if it were not for the short plot and buggy cutscenes.			",11,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love Star Wars and this is a good story in the saga. However, for some reason the background won't render/ load in my game so I can only see what is right next to me in the game. If there is a way to fix this someone please tell me. However, because of this problem ** SPOILER COMING UP** in the level where Starkiller is trying to pull down the Stardestroyer I can't see the damn thing because it is in the background!! I bought the game on sale so im not that annoyed but if I had payed full price I would have been furious.			",33,4,0,4,3,0,9

												I expected more from the PC port of this game but sadly it has disappointed me. The PS2 and PC ports are much better despite not having the bonus DLC's. Keystrokes are always delayed in this game. Mission objectives are confusing since they    are not updated from time to time. Cutscenes are also sensitive even to the slightest press of a keyboard button. In sum, its predecessor is definitely better if it were not for the short plot and buggy cutscenes.			",11,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game is repetitive and slow. The combat is clunky and boring.The game tries to get you amped up to play by having you play as Darth Vader, which they manage to somehow make INCREDIBLY tedious and unenjoyable. Don't bother with this or the second one.The only thing this game has going for it is the story and you can watch someone else deal with this game to get that.			",248,71,2,18,7,1,19

												If you like Star Wars this game is for you. Has alot of action and lore, related to Darth Vader's Secret Apprentice, Starkiller.It's a Hack and Slash, wich means, mash your buttons to victory! But really, you do have to dodge occasionally, plus, you get to be a bad♥♥♥♥♥using the Force.I have to say, I liked it. Was entertaining plus you actually *can* make choices. Wich is something you don't see everyday with Hack and Slashes.All in all, it's a good game, although I advise getting this and the second one at the same time. You'll just want more and more. *.*Have fun!			",361,40,6,27,23,0,19

												Great game overall. Ive enjoyed this game on Ps3 and now on Pc. Ultimate Sith edition gives you every DLC costumes and levels. Now you can unleash your force in 3 new DLC levels as Lord Starkiller, Emperors new right hand man. The game suffers from the same problems as console version. Nothing is fixed. So if you encounter some framerate issues, no, your computer is not to blame or some irritating battle clitches, its not your skills, its the game. If you can get past these issues youll have an enjoyable gametime. Not so storywise but it is awesome to throw your enemies all over the place with you Force. Play this game on easy and you can experience what it means to be a true Force badass or use harder difficulty to punish yourself. This game gets solid 8/10 from me.			",260,83,7,38,20,2,29

												I initially wanted to write this franchise off completely, but it's similarity to the Jedi Knight series is so parallel I can't help but be won over. Though with all it's flash and presentation it still doesn't hold a candle to JK. Not like comparing the Trilogy to the prequels, but more like comparing the Trilogy to the Trilogy that Lucas drug his greedy little pud all over decades later, and re-released.

												For any Star wars gamer, this game is an exciting experience. You begin as Darth Vader himself! A fantastic nod to the fan community, and many people who think Vader is badass, and march around in home made costumes depecting the Sith Lord to stunnning quality. Wait no longer, you will be tossing around troopers and Wookies at the drop of a hat, and later doing massive damage with force powers like lightning, and combinations of various powers which reach deadly levels, as Starkiller. Discover an epic plot masterminded by Vader himself, and help him achieve his goals...or do you have goals of your own? Customize your own lightsaber with various crystal colors, and even special crystals that boost force powers or saber damage. Fight a variety of enemies and take advantage of your environment in strategic and out-of-the-box ways. Every level plays differently each time with a sweet AI that provides a good deal of variety and unexpected turns.			",214,64,4,32,52,2,35

A SQUIGY BALL OF AWESOMNESSThis game is quite enjoyable with messed up physics making it a goat simulator for wookies and a repetative RPG simulator for burned people in haloween costumes and the elderly who have been rubbing baloons against their fingertips all day.The story is also very nice with two alternate endings avalible to you, one of which will lead you to the sequel and other will lead you to replaying the chapter so the story makes sense before playing the sequel.Overall this is a good game with some repetitivness in boss fights, which is to be expected. The game starts off so well it will leave you wanting more, which you get, then leaves you wanting less.ADVICE: Get game on saleFinal score: 10/10Bet you weren't expecting THAT! ",29,3,0,2,2,0,2

												If you like star wars buying this game should not really be a question and the fact you are looking at the reviews should make you question your fandom, however, this game is amazing and although it is non-cannon (from what I have heard at least) it displays an amazing world in between ""Revenge of the Sith"" and ""A New Hope"" as the apprentice to Vader. It shows you how awesome it can be to be a Sith and really delves into the awesome powers of the force. In addition, the DLC's are great expansions to the game and are definitely worth the while.

												This game is clearly made to be played with a controller. It is impossible to do certain things with keyboard/mouse. Boss fights force camera perspective change so it creates an extra level of difficulty, except it is not due to mechanics or strategy, but harder controls, which takes away from the experience. Fights are monotonous and I can't judge story line as I didn't finish the game. Is this game suppose to make you angry? So you can feel the dark side flowing through you? This game could have been soo much more. At least the rating is an easy binary choice as the Sith deal in absolutes.			",10,1,0,0,2,0,0

												This game is everything that i remember playing so long ago. My biggest issue with it right now is that the controller support for it is non existant as i go into different forums chats and multiple driver downloads to just see if i am even able to map a wireless ds4 controller. So its been more than a week trying to make the controller work to no avail so unfortunetly in this case i must not recomend this version. I believe that anyone should go with the console version on this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its an okay hack and slash thats story has a fairly good ending that is cute but then again I think theres atleast two endings.The big problems are the frustrating enemy design that stun locks you sometimes to the point you lose half your health without having control of your character. This is why you should just play it on normal, alot less frustrating that way. Also the game is broken. Somewhere along the line things have gotten very broken. I think modern OS and drivers have made the game really broken. Not like ""wont run"" broken but more like sound dousn't work right, physics occasionally goes mad and other strange happenings. Its funny, I think it made the game marginally more fun because I like that sort of thing but I doubt most others will.Other issues are really just marginal. The games an enjoyable and decently good hack and slash game that dousn't feel just like another God Of War game and has a heavy impetus on physics. I ♥♥♥♥ing love physics in games, especially Euphoria.			",329,48,6,36,35,3,74

												Pros:- Story is interesting- Music score lives up to Star Wars- Using force powers is really cool- Graphics looks OKCons- Combat is very basic with very little combo options- Responce time is extremely laggy, resulting in deaths due to delayed responce- Many glitches and bugs, game was released flat out unfinished and was obviously not polished since release- Locked at 30 fps (there is an easy fix to get it to 60fps or higher but that brings in more glitches and bugs, for example setting the game at 60fps will cause you to force lift objects upwards causing you to have to revert back to 30fps in order to progress, plus locked fps on a PC game is an unforgivable sin no matter what)- Considering this is the next gen verion of the game its questionable that the PS2/Wii versions have more content, cuts clearly have been made (and I'm not talking about the extra DLC missions)- Loading screens are freakishly long even on an SSD4/10 overall, can only recommend this to Star Wars fans who love to collect games for the sake of collecting them or if they feel the need to invest in story, anyone stay away, there are far better hack and slash games) ",85,2,3,6,3,1,0

Has alot of action and lore, related to Darth Vader's Secret Apprentice, Starkiller.It's a Hack and Slash, wich means, mash your buttons to victory! But really, you do have to dodge occasionally, plus, you get to be a bad♥♥♥♥♥using the Force.I have to say, I liked it. Was entertaining plus you actually *can* make choices.

												Great game overall. Ive enjoyed this game on Ps3 and now on Pc. Ultimate Sith edition gives you every DLC costumes and levels. Now you can unleash your force in 3 new DLC levels as Lord Starkiller, Emperors new right hand man. The game suffers from the same problems as console version. Nothing is fixed. So if you encounter some framerate issues, no, your computer is not to blame or some irritating battle clitches, its not your skills, its the game. If you can get past these issues youll have an enjoyable gametime. Not so storywise but it is awesome to throw your enemies all over the place with you Force. Play this game on easy and you can experience what it means to be a true Force badass or use harder difficulty to punish yourself. This game gets solid 8/10 from me.			",260,83,7,38,20,2,29

												Jetzt geht es in die nächste Runde.Endlich kann man mal im Star Wars Spiele Universum die dunkle Seite der Macht spiele.Man schlüpft in die Rolle des Galen Marek, dem unbekannten und sehr mächtigen Schüler des Darth Vader.Ihr sollt für Darth Vader die Jedi, töten die die Order 66 überlebt haben.Auf dem Weg zu den Jedis muss man paar Rätsel lösen und immer wieder Druiden, Sturmtruppen oder Rebellentruppen umbringen.Die Steuerrung ist ungefähr so wie bei Assassin Creed. Zum Glück hat man dieses mal die besten Machttricks sofort in naher reichweite(das ständige F-Tasten drücken wie bei Jedi Knight gibt es nicht mehr). Zwischen den Leveln kann man in eine Art Trainingsraum seinen Kampfstil verbessern, und somit immer mehr und mächtige Macht Combos erlernen.Die Endgegner werden zuerst ganz normal im Nahkampf angegriffen.Wenn Galen den Gegner den Gnadenstoss geben will sehen wir immer eine Art Video bei den wir dann nur noch 3-4 Tasten drücken müssen.Im Add ons welches dabei ist, kann man durch das durchspielen die Endenvon Episode 4-6 verändern. So gewinnt vielleicht doch mal das Imperium.Genre: ActionEntwickler: LucasArts , Aspyr Studios Publisher: LucasArts Bewertung:8/10 ActionWir wünsche euch viel Spas beim zocken.Möge die Macht mit euch sein.Euer Pixelhead Team			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I initially wanted to write this franchise off completely, but it's similarity to the Jedi Knight series is so parallel I can't help but be won over. Though with all it's flash and presentation it still doesn't hold a candle to JK. Not like comparing the Trilogy to the prequels, but more like comparing the Trilogy to the Trilogy that Lucas drug his greedy little pud all over decades later, and re-released.

												I liked playing this game, although there are upsides and downsides:+ the story was pretty good and  I was kind of curious what would happen next+ special lightsaber parts, but:- changing the Lightsaber Color actually only changes its appearance+ Style of the fighting system, but:- technique of the fighting system (Autoaim is sometimes malicious)-  Really bad recovery, if you accidentially get hit by a missile while enemies surround you you might actually diebecause you take damage even while lying on the ground and he takes ages to get up again- Button mashing suffices most of the time to kill most enemies, including some bosses+ Interesting Bossfights, but: - more or less trial and error, which seemed unfair sometimes so I had some difficulties against some and died 4 or 5 times until I got their pattern  Darth Maul, Fight against Vader where he stands in the middle and throws rubbish at you, same with the Imperator, and I also experienced some difficulty against the girl with the double nunchuck sabers (forgot her name, sorry)  , some of the other bosses were too easy where you can just spam one Combo to kill them+ the graphics were good (considering its age)+ original sound- bad trashmob AI- some minor bugs, like music not playing, standing on top of platforms where you shouldn't be able to get to, AT-ST's where you are able to stand on their feet and do infinite combos in mid-air- only 5h to play through on medium difficultyI still liked playing it! Would I recommend it? If you like Star Wars, definitely, even if you would only play it on easyto experience the story. But if you are looking for a technically flawless game with dozens of hours of gameplay and an insane fighting system, this game might actually disappoint you.I heard SW:TFU2 is better. Gonna play it now :)			",41,2,0,12,0,0,2

												If you like star wars buying this game should not really be a question and the fact you are looking at the reviews should make you question your fandom, however, this game is amazing and although it is non-cannon (from what I have heard at least) it displays an amazing world in between ""Revenge of the Sith"" and ""A New Hope"" as the apprentice to Vader. It shows you how awesome it can be to be a Sith and really delves into the awesome powers of the force. In addition, the DLC's are great expansions to the game and are definitely worth the while.

												Having played this already on my PS3 and also beat it on the PS2, there are a couple of differences.Firstly, the levels are totally different than the ps2 version. The graphics are much more enhanced, the cutscenes are more fluid and the combat system is top notch. My only gripes are that the PS2 version had some bosses who were very memorable and they have been cut off from the game. If you have the Ultimate Sith edition then you get some levels that were in the PS2/Wii version like the Jedi Temple.Overall its an awesome game. You get to choose whether you end up a Jedi or Sith.Breakdown:Graphics: 8/10Locations/levels: 7/10 with base game, 9/10 with Sith EditionCombat: 7/10Story: 9/10Its a trap: 10/10 ",33,2,0,3,2,0,1

												It should be known that I played this game vigorously on Xbox 360, so in terms of storyline, cannon, and other non-machine related topics, I have at least 300 hours of experience in this title.Star Wars The Force Unleashed, is possibly one of the most entertaining Star Wars games I've ever had the pleasure of playing! It is not a game fitting for the avid lightsaber fight loving Jedi/Sith personality, as this game's name; 'the force unleashed', is quite literal. You get 'way' more options in this game in terms of using the force, than you do with lightsaber combat...Frankly, lightsaber combat in this game is more of a 'last resort' deal, or if the enemies are so weak/few that it honestly would take longer to beat them with the force.In terms of gameplay, however, the game is extremely entertaining, and thanks to the game's commendable difficulty curve, from Apprentice to Sith Master(last one has to be unlocked), the game sports an absolute TON of replayability, from alternative endings, to new lightsaber colors, to new unlockable costumes and entirely new characters, the game is one of those gems which has you coming back for more!In terms of lore, the Force Unleashed opens a new, previously unexplained gap between two movies, I believe its number II and III(not the newer videos). It tells the story of a rogue Sith apprentice to Darth Vader, codenamed simply as Starkiller, who works under the strict and vicicous tutelage of the Dark Lord himself, effectively hunting down exiled Jedi. However, as the story presses on, the young Sith apprentice begins, for varying reasons, to feel less secure in his apprenticeship to Lord Vader, and his life takes a complete U-turn when he meets his new ship pilot, Juno.The story is believable, as it fills in a lore gap to explain what happened in the space between movie II and III.Graphics wise, this game is on par with modern video games, and takes quite a bit of effort on your GPUs part to keep up the Framerate counter, however, it can easily be resolved by lowering the resolution, and unchecking the High detail box prior to starting the game, which pretty much eliminates framerate lag(Unless your computer is a potato with copper wires in it)Do I think this game, and its sequel, are worth adding to your Star Wars game collection? Without a doubt. This game's shere popularity, and Lore accuracy, makes it a 'must play' in order to get insight into a truly intense and entertaining part of the untold-in-the-movies story!

												The concept is cool but the execution is sub-par. It is very linear which is not nessesarily a bad thing depending on your preferences.The biggest problem I had with this game is that the menus are completely broken. There is text missing, especially in the menu that lists the combos, to such a degree as to make it impossible to use. Opening the game options locks the game up. The frame rate drops dramatically in some areas and the keyboard/mouse controls are awful. In short it is a bad port.			",111,4,1,9,14,0,9

Whelp, I just rage uninstalled this piece of crap and we're skipping to the bad review.It's the worst game I've ever played in my life. I love star wars, I love 3rd person action games. This game is EVERYTHING wrong with both things. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Not even for the story, not for anything. Avoid it. Every single person involved with making this game should never be allowed to develop another game. Mixed reviews is dishonest and too good for this game. This game is terrible, and should be taken out of the store. The fact that Steam allows people to continue to buy this on some random Star Wars craving urge is one of the most evil things they do.TLDR: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			",126,32,1,10,7,1,7

												When I first started playing this game I thought it will be at least playable. I was wrong. This game is just garbage.So lets start with good things:- Good story- New, interesting charactersThats all I can think of. It sounds good but the gameplay of this game is horrible.Bad things about this game:- Locked framerate at 30 Fps - Awful camera movement (it is even worse during boss battles)- Game is completely unoptimized for PC- Horrible controls (even when you change the controls the game will show you the old controls. For example: you change force push from E to R, but the game will show you to press E even though you have to press R.- Lame boss battles- Many glitches- Many bugs- There is no cursor and you have do to everything in the menu or pause screen by keyboard- Sound glitches (very silent during gameplay, but very loud during cutscenes)- The cutscenes will just end randomly in the middle- Quick time events everywhereI could probably go for longer but these are the main issues with the game.I don't recommend buying this game. If you want to try it better buy Star Wars Collection. Buying the game alone isn't worth it.TL;DR: Good story, awful gameplay5/10			",42,6,0,3,11,0,4

												I want to like this game. It has so much potential. And sometimes when you're playing it there are moments that are really, really fun. When you're jumping from Stromtrooper to Stormtrooper, your lightsaber combos are flowing beautifully, you're force throws are on point, you feel really powerful. The close you can ever feel to being a real Jedi.But unfortunately those moments are too far between. What could be epic gameplay is, more often than not, hampered by shotty targeting, bad camera angles, weird boss fights that block everything so you can't really use any good combos or slick moves, annoying sequences where you will get hit by an attack that knocks you down, and it takes your character so long to stand back up that you're hit by another one immediately, and this repeats until you die while you scream at your monitor. Seriously for being a badass Jedi, this guy stands up at a speed that would make my grandpa laugh. For every time you epicly force grab something and throw it at an enemy, there are three times where you force grab something and for some reason throw it in a completely random direction. Or when you try and force lightning someone, and for some reason you force lightning the air right beside them while they stand there and look at you like you're crazy.The game is difficult. But not in a fun way. I like a game that is a challenge. If I make a mistake, punish me (didn't realize how dirty that sounded until I said it out loud). But this game isn't difficult in that way. It's difficult in a lot of the enemies have slow, repetitive unblockable attacks that knock you down over and over and over again. It's difficult where the boss just randomly becomes invincible/blocks everything you have so you just have to wait for him to let you start attacking again. Really any lightsaber duel feels less like a duel and more like you using force lightning and just running away because that's significantly more effective than actually using your lightsaber due to the enemy blocking all your attacks and all of his attacks being unblockable. It has entirely too many jumping puzzles for a game with a bad camera and an erratic, unreliable double jump.Little things like that that should have never made it through any kind of QA testing.The DNA of a great game is there. But it needed another 6 months of polishing before release, at least. This is on the top of my ""games that didn't live up to their immense potential"" list.And that's not even counting how bad of a PC port this is. Straight port. 30fps. No extra graphic enhancements. Nothing to take advantage of being on a PC. Just seems lazy.I played the game all the way through because of those brief moments of fun. But I would say I only really enjoyed myself about %30 of the time, the other %70 I was just more annoyed and frustrated than anything else.			",204,88,2,25,16,4,25

												I wanted to like this game but it's just awful.Controls are terrible unresponsive. You can't target by yourself, camera is fixed in boss battles so targeting is even worse. It takes many tries to dash constantly. When you fall it takes long time to stand up and sometimes enemies will spam attacks while you're there.Also, the player is supposed to be and overpowered force wielder but in the end I don't feel that way. At the same time you get more powers, enemies get the right way to counter them, especially bosses. They will block instantly when you push a button. It's frustrating and kind of hilarious because you feel like controling both characters at same time, one attacking and one blocking.By the way, the ligthsaber feels like you're beating enemies with a stick instead of slicing them with grace.I played the second one and I have to say that even though it's shorter it's much better game.

												The game itself is great, and even with a very short playthrough I can agree this is going to be a great game, even after 8 years. But...The main reason why I DON'T recommend this game here is the port itself. To all who are willing to buy this, read this:There is a unsolvable, game-breaking glitch that creats this ""Hall of Mirrors"" effect in the Background. And it's even worst on the second level. This is a warning to everyone who is willing to buy this game. In other words: Don't buy it!And for those who are wondering: I have an Intel HD 2000, and it runs smoothly, but that's not the problem!And now a plea to the company-Aspyr:Please patch this game! There are soultions to this problem, yet none are proven to completely fixing this game-breaking glitch that has plagued this port completely! This is the PRIME reason why this is consider as one of the worst ports in gaming history! Don't make us suffer even longer with this! We demand a patch or a fix of this game NOW!!!

Amazing game, if you like open world, a lot of free will and Star Wars this is DEFINITELY the game for you. Unlike most other games this game lets you play however you want, you can use almost anything as a weapon and have a lot of powers to defeat enemies while you also have a huge variety of customisations to make your sith warrior exactly how you want it, a lot of modern games do not have these kind of things. This is the best bang for your buck game I have ever seen in my life. ",45,1,0,3,2,0,0

												You get into game and everything seems cool, until you discover that everything gets dull and repetitive very quickly. It turns into button mashing in QTE and even throught the game is short, you just dont want to play it. The story tries, but fails almost everywhere, mostly because  of main character who is probably the least sympathetic hero ever made, he reveals as arrogant whiny obnoxious ♥♥♥♥♥, I hate him so much. Whatever happened to Jedi Knight games? This is just disappointing. Basically Star Wars game made upon the concept of always angry 13-year old .			",203,56,9,27,27,2,24

												Star Wars game that is (debatably) cannon. Many of the reviews are complaining about the controls or that it was glitchy-- None of which were super bad, at least for my computer. There are definately flaws, but this game is actually pretty old, made in 2008. It has an interesting story and fun gameplay, even a new soundtrack mixed with Star Wars' classic music. I had a lot more fun with it than I did Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, although both were great ;)			",50,28,4,4,11,1,2

												The idea is there, but contains some of the worst designed boss fights I've ever seen.  Main gameplay is pretty fun, but the boss fights are tedious and overly difficult.A lot of your first runthrough will involve playing on normal, then swapping to easy during boss fights, then back to normal for the next level.Upgrades carry over through playthroughs, so you're expected to start on easy and increase the difficulty on each subsequent run as the upgrades you earned should balance it back out.

												Do NOT buy this game. It may have a half decent story and all, but the gameplay is enough to drive anyone insane. Boss battles require you to do repetitive cheap tactics rather than enjoy an awesome lightsaber battle, which was always a highlight in the films. Even the cheap tactic of force grip and throwing someone to damage/kill them is still not very functional due to the HORRIBLE targetting mechanics. You will end up not being able to grab anyone because you never get to target your enemy even when they're literally 4 feet from you. NOTHING about the gameplay is fluid. Skill is absolutely not a factor.Do you want to be a Jedi or Sith? Unfortunately you have only a one time choice and it's at the end of the game. It's not even obvious that there is a choice. Look it up and you'll see what I mean, no spoilers here.Want to force throw 3 large items at once? You got it!.. Want to hit the only enemy around with 3 said objects? NOPE! Aiming things you throw is almost random and unfortunately you have to do it to pick down the bosses so you can actually have a lightsaber fight when they're at about 5% health.The checkpoint system is terrible, the UI is bad, the menu/options screen is the worst I've ever seen.Want to skip a cutscene? Sure! Press all buttons.. nothing. Press enter though and you'll just open the menu to save your game!.. Handy feature that is.. Saving mid cutscene.I could go on for hours.. I hate this game, I play it for the story because I like Star Wars... Going in I wanted to be a Jedi, now I'm definitely turned to the dark side.Oh, yeah.. and the game is capped at 30 fps and 5.1 sound so enjoy the choppy gameplay and very poor audio unless you have a 5.1 speaker setup in your house.

												I would play this game more if the boss fights weren't so trash. I don't know if they resolved those issues in the second one because it refuses to work so I guess I will never know. The main gameplay of this gets a 8/10. HOWEVER, the I'm giving it a 4/10 on the basis that you have to have boss fights at such a stupid fixed camera angle. Also do NOT play this with a keyboard. Too much hassle.			",172,7,5,7,20,1,19

												They should bring this game up to date with the controller or anything there is, the bad fps and the dang mirror glitch that has me all over, i get so annoyed from that, the first level where you play as darth vader, i get the mirror glitch and everything i see in the sky is mirrored and when i move the camera it gets mirrored again into an endless mirror, its so annoying, can someone at least contact steam or anyone or anything to fix this game because there was just a star wars sale and some people bought this for cheap, but turns out they cant play it because of how horrible it really is, at least fix the bugs.

												I would like to start off by explaining that i am a huge fan of all things star wars, so when i was able to buy this i was very happy. However when i discovered that not only was this the worst port, but some of its bugs made the game to glitchy to pass certain levels. Right now i cant even complete the scrap yard mission due to a piece of terrain i have to move, to move on, being stuck in the wall. If possible id honestlly like to ask for my money back, i bought this expecting the high rated game all my friends who also love star wars recommended, and now i cant even get past a mission due to a glitch this bad, this dissapoints me as bad as games like aliens colonial marines. I wish aspyr put more time into this port so i could actually enjoy the money i spent expecting a fantastic adventure into the star wars universe, i got nothing of the sorts.			",87,19,0,3,8,0,30

Enemies spawn right next to you for some ungodly reason so you are just powering up an attack against a boss then suddenly an enemie disrupts. When I say right next to I literally mean a step behind you. Plus the controls are so un-intuitive that they have literally spent about 10 minutes porting this game.

												I tried really hard to enjoy this game, I really did. I'm a fan of Star Wars, and I enjoy action games that require skill beyond mashing one button the entire game so I thought this would be a great fit. To make this short, this game was a let down. Enemies can stun lock you by giving you a stern look, while multiple slashes with hot plasma and force attacks that could move a battleship do nothing to any foe stronger than the basic trooper. Dodgy keyboard controls add to the poor design choices, if you do play this game then a controller is highly suggested. What finally did it in for me was the final battle. Without giving anything away, I was 1-shot by the final boss when he stuck me between himself and a corner. To sum it up: Only get this game in a bundle or on sale, and don't get your hopes up too high.			",131,19,0,46,15,0,16

												Frustrating and stiff controls*, repetitive combat, one-dimensional characters, annoying enemies, unnecessary quick time events, artificially long boss fights. And knockback, don't even get me started on knockback. Very little time spent in between levels; you grind your way through a linear level, kill the boss, watch a brief cutscene and are immediately dropped into the next mission. Story is mediocre, visuals are pretty good by 2009 standards, but the textures can be pretty ugly at times. Almost too much of a reliance on mattes makes anything not in your immediate vicinity look flat and motionless. One of the better looking Star Wars games out there, though, but it's also one of the only recent ones.If you're a really big Star Wars fan, grab it during the summer sale. Otherwise, stick with better hack-n-slash games like God of War or Devil May Cry.*Note: I played with an Xbox 360 controller; however the controls were still frustrating and a horrible targeting system makes force grip a chore to use.

												Don't get me wrong, it's a great game. Combines platforming, puzzles, and action combat with force powers that were out of this world when it was released. Not too mention it's a really cool story (was even canon until recently). The reason I can't recommend it here is because it's buggy, freezes, and has exceptionally long loading times, and I have a very good gaming computer. I didn't experience any of these problems on the PS3 so I'm fairly surprised to see them here. Anyway, I got it on sale, so I'm not incredibly dissapointed.			",29,3,0,18,10,0,9

												Next to Kane and Lynch 1 this is the worst game to find enjoyment in.  I'm sure to those who have not play Darksiders, GoW or DMC it's a 'good game.'  No, it is not.  The AI gets preferential treatment, and there is no fluid feel to the 'force.'  Once the AI starts their routine of kicking your chocolate starfish in, its all hands on the wtftrain.I'm sure the newly converted (console players) will tell you it's great, but they are, simply, wrong.  It's a 4 hour game that, the now defunct, Lucas Arts dragged out to 9~11 hours.TLDR:  Play ANYTHING ELSE			",242,20,7,20,4,0,10

There was a ""save game"" button in the menu, but it seemed no matter when you used it, it didn't have any impact on where the game would start after continueing the game or death.

												Possibly one of the most frustrating games ever made. It is frustrating because you want to play it and actually enjoy playing it despite the issue with targetting; but when you get to the boss fights, it is almost unplayable in any enjoyable sense. Whoever thought of turning the boss fights into some sort of Mortal Kombat type side-view camera needs to be flogged, publicly. You have to keep track of where Starkiller is facing, there are tons of things he could target--and does--the only thing you want to target is the boss. Sure you can target lock, but get knocked down or otherwise disengaged and bam, you're off targetting something on a wall. The whole side-view cinematic camera nonsense was probably dreamed up by some space cadet muppet who is not a gamer. It honestly spoils the game. If I wanted Mortal Kombat, I'd buy Mortal Kombat because they do Mortal Kombat style fights scenes properly!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The thing I would change the most about this game is the combat because it's just too clunky for a game based solely around combat, and it isn't helped by boss battles being screenlocked. It's a shame because the game is beautiful and really does immerse you into the Star Wars Universe but the gameplay is just frustrating.			",48,2,0,5,2,0,10

Speaking of infuriating Purge Troopers have this wonderful ability to fire missiles at you from across the room that knock you down and when you do get back on your feet its just in time for another missile. There is also a fair amount of lag between the controller and the character that leads to some rather rough moments fighting muiltiple enemy types. All and all it feels rushed and not quite at the level of polish I believe the developers would have been happy with.Pros: There are times when everything falls together and you do feel like a badass sith.Story.

												The graphics are awesome, the physics are great but this game fails in a crucial aspect -- the gameplay. It's monotonous, linear and after a while a tedious chore. The bossfights are outright idiotic -- suddenly, you no longer play a 3d person shooter but an isometric hack&slash with quick-time events to finish the boss. If you customized your key controls, the game still instructs you to press the default keys which is frustratingly confusing. And, as it goes with quick-time events, you get to watch a scripted sequence with occasional keypress which steals the rewarding feel of defeating the opponent all by yourself. The story is nice but all characters have dead eyes so there's less life in them than in Jedi Outcast or Jedi Academy. Also, Vader's got different voice actor.I wanted badly the negative reviews not to be true but they are. Buy/stick to Jedi Academy instead, it's a far better game at making you feel like a jedi.

												I remembered playing the demo of this game on the Xbox 360 years ago and having a favorable experience.  Game is on sale so why not, bad idea.  This is NOT that game.  It is not a bad game per say if you have never played another action game and you started playing video games in 1998 or so...  But by today's standards it is awful.  The first thing you will notice after you get to say the third or fourth level is that the camera gets caught behind things.  Then the play control, it is out of this world awful.  You do a button combination and it delays for a second.  Your character will take a while to set up his moves, but thankfully the computer AI is super fast.  Trying to levitate a rock to throw at a character, well you better have at least a second before.... too late the computer can instantly hurl rocks, lasers, or rockets.  Which leads me to ... blocking.  You really can only block when you know way in advance you want to do it, other than that it is pointless.  But when you are getting pumelled don't worry the game developers thought enough to allow you to keep getting attacked till you do a very slow get back up.This game is crap on the play control and graphics and this is 2015.  There are ton of other action games that put this game to shame.  One of the few games I will probably finish because the story is a little intriguing but the gameplay is godawful.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I got so sick of aligning the ship so I could pull it down just when the next wave of tie fighters came. And then eventually it stopped guiding my alignment and it said that I was always wrong no matter what I did. In short, this game does have a lot of potential.

Level design is not good, enemies are either too easy or stunlock you until you die, checkpoints are not close enough together and you will ALWAYS be fighting the camera. I probably wouldn't play this without a USB gamepad. The controls are not tight at all and it's hard to get your character to do what you want him to do. You will fall off of edges a lot because the platforming is terrible. There are QTEs at the end of boss fights.Personally, this game feels like it has a spectacle-fighter sort of vibe. Except, it lacks almost everything that makes a spectacle fighter good. If done correctly, this game could have been amazing. The graphics are pretty good (aside from the cutscenes). But honestly, nothing dates this game more than its terrible control and camera issues.Overall, I think the game is fun, despite its shortcomings. I would probably only get this game at a heavily discounted price though. This is a bargin-bin game (which is where I bought my Wii version). It is good fun for that kind of game. But I find myself setting the game down at least once every 30 minutes because of how frustrating it can be. Unlike something like Dark Souls, this game controls so sloppily that you do not blame yourself, you blame this poorly made game.			",212,36,9,12,17,5,28

												Pretty terrible game. Maybe check it out if you like the Streetfighter / Mortal Kombat - style platform fighting games.Combo-mashing mixed with quicktime events, mixed with horrible little pseudo-3D bossfights where the movement controls suddenly don't make any sense and your guy spends half his time hanging in mid-air cleaning his fingernails and waiting to land from a ""cinematic"" slow-time jump... and for all that I still managed to beat the first boss by just repeatedly mashing all the attack buttons as fast as I could.  And that was on the ""hard"" difficulty setting.Uninstalled.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is a broken, broken game. I really wanted to finish it because of the story and setting, even with how terrible the gameplay, main character, and level presentations was, but I couldn't because of horrendous lag problems, lack of camera control, and tedious, boring combat. It has some cool elements like a slew of alternate costumes and force powers, but I couldn't push myself to get further than the fourth level before I got fed up with it. This would have been okay if it was released in 2003, but it's far below the bar for 2008 standards.			",153,12,1,19,3,0,10

												I did enjoy this game but it doesn't hold up anymore. I had played the wii version long ago and thought it was fun so I decided to pick this up. In short, it wasn't as good as I remembered and it probably isn't good to the average person. If you really are interested, pick it up for under $10 and be aware that THIS GAME IS 30 GB. Besides this huge file size, it is apparent that this isn't very well optimized as the framerate drops fairly often, level sounds randomly stop playing, and there are even decent loading times between menus. The three bonus campaigns, huge selection of costumes, and the black lighsaber are still cool though.And if you really just have the urge to experience the cool lightsaber action, I would recommend The Force Unleashed 2.

												I was really hoping for a good Star Wars Game, and i have to say at times this game is just amazing. Great Graphics, good fight scenes.But overall the PC-Port hurts this game extremly, or at least my gaming experience.Controling your character and the combat is sometimes just too hard because it wasn't developed for PC.Because of this the camera angle is sometimes just aweful.Another thing is the balance, sometimes you have normal enemies that are more challenging than the boss....Or the boss is too hard because you have to make an insane combo, that would be rather easy with a controller, but with a keyboard...Overall: I is a nice game, but i can't really recommend it because of it's port nature.

												Clunky controls and plenty of strange game-breaking bugs throughout. The boss fights are dull and repetitive, often spamming the same attack combos over and over. Most of the game encourages cheesing the mechanics rather than thinking outside the box. If you are going to buy the game, play it with a controller. For only being released a few years ago, this game feels extremely dated.			",29,1,0,5,3,0,8

												Honestly, I'd recommend sticking to the novelization instead. I quite enjoyed the book, and eventually gave the game a try. It's been kind of a mess; I spent as much of the story as I could get through not understanding what in the heck was actually going on, the actual gameplay's a generic hack-and-slash, and the sheer number of graphical and gameplay glitches made it borderline unplayable, on a powerful Origin PC that was actually able to run Arkham Knight at launch. Pop-in is atrocious and constant, cutscenes flicker oddly, and the 30FPS limit still comes with occasional slowdown. All of this would be tolerable if there was enough game to really keep you hooked, but in my case, there isn't. In my time with the game, it randomly crashed mid-level without warning and without saving very, very often. It's rather generic. Save yourself the trouble; if you want the story, get the book, and if you want to play as Galen Marek, get SoulCalibur IV or LEGO Star Wars III, really.			",202,57,48,14,17,5,10

												Combat system has one hell of a learning curve. This isn't some button masher where you can just swing your lightsaber to victory. You need to think strategically about each move you make. Enemies can take a nasty chunk of you health away if you aren't playing correctly, and it's just a struggle until you actually start using the good force which aren't all that intuitive nor are they always reliable. Force push controls sometimes fly objects off in directions you didn't want, and the camera angles are just bad, especially boss fights. I would say that in this game, there wasn't a single boss fight I enjoyed. Every one of them was just annoying. As enemies can begin to block your attacks mid combo but you can't do the same to them....so if they hit you once they may as hit you 2-4 more times for a massive lost in health due to the ragdoll mechanics. I found myself stunned in ragdoll mode many many times due to be hit by an offscreen projectile...remember those camera angles I mentioned earlier?Story: 8/10Combat: 3/10 (camera angles, ragdoll physics, overpowered AI, and annoying stuns, just kills the combat system)I'd rate this game 4/10			",14,1,0,3,0,0,1

												I got some hours of fun out of this game. But this game have an insame amount of problems and there is so much frustrating nonsense in this game.The game is locked to 30 fps on pc. This can be unlocked which i did and it worked fine outside of some glitchy quicktime events. This still sucks though. The port has also screwed up some quicktime events royally and doing some of them with mouse and keyboard is insanely frustrating. The story is crap and the character interaction is boring at the best of times. The environments aren't all that varied and they are reused which kind of sucks.But the focus of this game is the combat and the combat can be fun at times. It is braindead but it can still be fun. But there are a bunch of problems which at times makes the combat extremely frustrating. The targeting sucks, locked camera angle sucks, quicktime event sucks, hits not registering sucks, hit detection sucks,invisible walls sucks and etc etc. In general stuff just didn't work as i expected them to and it just becomes extremely frustrating whenever something is actually challenging. People who like the license can probably get some fun out of this game and it is a nice touch that you get a bunch of different familiar skins to play with. But i would not recommend this game for anyone else.			",554,123,25,77,58,3,64

												REPETITIVE AND CANCER-CAUSING GAMETHE GAME THAT PULLS YOU INTO CURSING; DARK SIDE Ok, first of all, I like Star Wars series and games like Jedi Knight. So, I got excited, buying The Force Unleashed: Ultimate Sith Edition.  And as I play the game, I find out that various force can be used in quite some techniques.   But, the npc's move and timing are frustrating that you don't have much choice to use certain moves. Another annoying part is that you can't reflect and defend yourself when you're down, So when you are down by bosses, you take all the damage and die repeatedly, especially in 'sith lord' difficulity mode. Other difficulty modes are strangely easy and boring.Game mechanics are repetitive considering the time the game was released. When the boss is at the pinch state, you have to follow and push buttons which you get to see over and over again. Ground glitches often occur and it's sometimes bad when you have to solve how to get holocrons.  Handling Force is a bit irriating. I use Xbox one controller and when use Force repulse by using RT. I can't Force push the object to a certain target which is a DAUM thing.  Boss Combat is S.H.I.T. yes literally. Boss be like I'll do my fight and you do your way but mine's gonna hurt in first priority. When you fight Vader or Sykwalker, stunned the opponent but it hits you so hard that you are tossed and especially the lightning ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t by Fallen Skywalker.  Don't get frustrated by the poor skill, the combat is hell. you can't react fast. The game is made to kill Star Wars fans. YOU GET TO CURSE A LOT IN 'SITH LORD' DIFFICULTY			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The fighting is fresh and cool and you have plenty of powers and abilities and combos to keep the gameplay nice and progressive. The problem with this game lies in the details.  There are alot of quicktime event, and they suck. The animations are great sure but quicktime events is a bad thing in itself and these are often hard to start because you are already spamming the buttons when it starts so you almost always fail the first time you try. Some missions are just painful, the worst was the mission where you have to bring a Star destroyer with the force but 6-7 tie fighter keep shooting at you, you then have to destroy them and continue destroying the ship(which takes a while) but the mission is very badly made and very very hard, way too hard in fact since more than half the time I tried to pick the ties with the force(you can only use the force to destroy them) it dosent work and they just pass through your grip and ♥♥♥♥ you up. Its a great game, but if you are easily frustrated like me, dont buy it unless its very very cheap and you dont mind getting stuck somewhere 4 hours while almost falling to the Dark side in real life.Tl;Dr: This game is so frustrating that I almost fell to the dark side playing it.

However when i discovered that not only was this the worst port, but some of its bugs made the game to glitchy to pass certain levels. Right now i cant even complete the scrap yard mission due to a piece of terrain i have to move, to move on, being stuck in the wall. If possible id honestlly like to ask for my money back, i bought this expecting the high rated game all my friends who also love star wars recommended, and now i cant even get past a mission due to a glitch this bad, this dissapoints me as bad as games like aliens colonial marines. I wish aspyr put more time into this port so i could actually enjoy the money i spent expecting a fantastic adventure into the star wars universe, i got nothing of the sorts.			",87,19,0,3,8,0,30

												I tried really hard to enjoy this game, I really did. I'm a fan of Star Wars, and I enjoy action games that require skill beyond mashing one button the entire game so I thought this would be a great fit. To make this short, this game was a let down. Enemies can stun lock you by giving you a stern look, while multiple slashes with hot plasma and force attacks that could move a battleship do nothing to any foe stronger than the basic trooper. Dodgy keyboard controls add to the poor design choices, if you do play this game then a controller is highly suggested. What finally did it in for me was the final battle. Without giving anything away, I was 1-shot by the final boss when he stuck me between himself and a corner. To sum it up: Only get this game in a bundle or on sale, and don't get your hopes up too high.			",131,19,0,46,15,0,16

Boss fights switch from 3rd person view, to fixed camera and subsequently forcing a different control scheme on you.  Save your time and money and watch the videos on youtube to get the story.

												Do NOT buy this game. It may have a half decent story and all, but the gameplay is enough to drive anyone insane. Boss battles require you to do repetitive cheap tactics rather than enjoy an awesome lightsaber battle, which was always a highlight in the films. Even the cheap tactic of force grip and throwing someone to damage/kill them is still not very functional due to the HORRIBLE targetting mechanics. You will end up not being able to grab anyone because you never get to target your enemy even when they're literally 4 feet from you. NOTHING about the gameplay is fluid. Skill is absolutely not a factor.Do you want to be a Jedi or Sith? Unfortunately you have only a one time choice and it's at the end of the game. It's not even obvious that there is a choice. Look it up and you'll see what I mean, no spoilers here.Want to force throw 3 large items at once? You got it!.. Want to hit the only enemy around with 3 said objects? NOPE! Aiming things you throw is almost random and unfortunately you have to do it to pick down the bosses so you can actually have a lightsaber fight when they're at about 5% health.The checkpoint system is terrible, the UI is bad, the menu/options screen is the worst I've ever seen.Want to skip a cutscene? Sure! Press all buttons.. nothing. Press enter though and you'll just open the menu to save your game!.. Handy feature that is.. Saving mid cutscene.I could go on for hours.. I hate this game, I play it for the story because I like Star Wars... Going in I wanted to be a Jedi, now I'm definitely turned to the dark side.Oh, yeah.. and the game is capped at 30 fps and 5.1 sound so enjoy the choppy gameplay and very poor audio unless you have a 5.1 speaker setup in your house.

												Never have I played a worse console port. Don't get me wrong, there are amazing game ideas there but its all wrapped up in toilet paper. Enemies spawn right next to you for some ungodly reason so you are just powering up an attack against a boss then suddenly an enemie disrupts. When I say right next to I literally mean a step behind you. Plus the controls are so un-intuitive that they have literally spent about 10 minutes porting this game. Very very fustrating considering there is the makings of a good game if they had spent a little more time on it.			",39,2,0,8,6,0,3

												I am SO sorry I wasted money on this game.  It is the worst console port I have ever experienced.  First of all, play with a mouse and keyboard is fairly awful in many main battle scenes.  It asks you to press some random buttons at certain moments that not only ruin the experience but are very difficult to do without a game controller.  But the main killer are the boss battles that are played with a fixed camera position.  I thought the ""side-scrolling"" sections of the Arkham games were bad....this is a nightmare!  Now all 360 degrees of movement rely on the keyboard (mouse is useless for direction here) and while you are struggling to aim your attacks in the right direction, you are getting your butt kicked at the same time.  After the third one of these, I uninstalled the game.Oh and btw-- this game takes up an impossible 29 gigs of hard drive space!!!  That alone should have been a red flag that this was poorly ported.			",96,22,1,14,5,0,16

												Possibly one of the most frustrating games ever made. It is frustrating because you want to play it and actually enjoy playing it despite the issue with targetting; but when you get to the boss fights, it is almost unplayable in any enjoyable sense. Whoever thought of turning the boss fights into some sort of Mortal Kombat type side-view camera needs to be flogged, publicly. You have to keep track of where Starkiller is facing, there are tons of things he could target--and does--the only thing you want to target is the boss. Sure you can target lock, but get knocked down or otherwise disengaged and bam, you're off targetting something on a wall. The whole side-view cinematic camera nonsense was probably dreamed up by some space cadet muppet who is not a gamer. It honestly spoils the game. If I wanted Mortal Kombat, I'd buy Mortal Kombat because they do Mortal Kombat style fights scenes properly!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got some hours of fun out of this game. But this game have an insame amount of problems and there is so much frustrating nonsense in this game.The game is locked to 30 fps on pc. This can be unlocked which i did and it worked fine outside of some glitchy quicktime events. This still sucks though. The port has also screwed up some quicktime events royally and doing some of them with mouse and keyboard is insanely frustrating. The story is crap and the character interaction is boring at the best of times. The environments aren't all that varied and they are reused which kind of sucks.But the focus of this game is the combat and the combat can be fun at times. It is braindead but it can still be fun. But there are a bunch of problems which at times makes the combat extremely frustrating. The targeting sucks, locked camera angle sucks, quicktime event sucks, hits not registering sucks, hit detection sucks,invisible walls sucks and etc etc. In general stuff just didn't work as i expected them to and it just becomes extremely frustrating whenever something is actually challenging. People who like the license can probably get some fun out of this game and it is a nice touch that you get a bunch of different familiar skins to play with. But i would not recommend this game for anyone else.			",554,123,25,77,58,3,64

												REPETITIVE AND CANCER-CAUSING GAMETHE GAME THAT PULLS YOU INTO CURSING; DARK SIDE Ok, first of all, I like Star Wars series and games like Jedi Knight. So, I got excited, buying The Force Unleashed: Ultimate Sith Edition.  And as I play the game, I find out that various force can be used in quite some techniques.   But, the npc's move and timing are frustrating that you don't have much choice to use certain moves. Another annoying part is that you can't reflect and defend yourself when you're down, So when you are down by bosses, you take all the damage and die repeatedly, especially in 'sith lord' difficulity mode. Other difficulty modes are strangely easy and boring.Game mechanics are repetitive considering the time the game was released. When the boss is at the pinch state, you have to follow and push buttons which you get to see over and over again. Ground glitches often occur and it's sometimes bad when you have to solve how to get holocrons.  Handling Force is a bit irriating. I use Xbox one controller and when use Force repulse by using RT. I can't Force push the object to a certain target which is a DAUM thing.  Boss Combat is S.H.I.T. yes literally. Boss be like I'll do my fight and you do your way but mine's gonna hurt in first priority. When you fight Vader or Sykwalker, stunned the opponent but it hits you so hard that you are tossed and especially the lightning ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t by Fallen Skywalker.  Don't get frustrated by the poor skill, the combat is hell. you can't react fast. The game is made to kill Star Wars fans. YOU GET TO CURSE A LOT IN 'SITH LORD' DIFFICULTY			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Note: I've played through the Wii version, which is almost an entirely different game from the 360/PS3/PC version due to motion controls and an altered storyline. Most of my problems with the game are still the same.As many other reviewers have said, this is a game with more than a few flaws which makes it very frustrating to play. The ONLY reason I might recommend this game is if you are a major Star Wars fan, it contains some nice additions to the universe. Otherwise you can just skip right over this in favor of the Jedi Knight series, which are vastly superior.Pros: For when it was released, the game's graphics are not terrible, although they definitely should have upgraded the graphics for the PC version. Interesting story. It's certainly not the best Star Wars story out there, and contains a bunch of cliches, but it's still fairly entertaining. It also provides some more lore about the time between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope.Now then...Cons: Combat. After playing Dark Souls and other more fast-paced hack-n'-slash games, I CANNOT play this game well, even with a controller. The combat controls feel slow and clunky, and there are too many minor issues which add up to making it rarely fun. Yes, it's fun to zap people to death with electricity or throw them halfway across the map, but when that becomes you most effective tactic because enemies will stunlock you in melee or get you stuck in lightsaber clashes, the game just becomes frustrating. I want to be a badass Sith warrior, not a cheap master of ragdoll physics and electrical conductivity. Loading screens in between menus. I can understand loading screens between levels, but between MENUS? Even though they're not terribly long, that's ridiculous. And I'm running the game off an SSD. Bugs. Many users report all sorts of bugs, from falling through the world to missing textures to straight-up CTDs. I've only ever experienced one CTD and one missing texture, which popped in a few seconds later, but that still seems horribly unpolished. Terrible port. The only option for tweaking the graphics I've been able to find is the checkbox for ""High Detail"". WTF does that mean? And why is the game locked to 30FPS? A textbook example of developers not putting even the minimal amount of effort into a port.All in all, unless you are a rabid fan of the series, avoid this game. I really REALLY wanted to love it, but I just can't. ",164,26,1,18,7,2,10

												So, like some people I got this from the Humble Bundle where this was was a tier 3. Now I though that for some reason that this would be better than the ps3 version which I had (and though it was boring). Little did I know that even with unofficial files to help make the game more playable, the game is still broken.Most of you probably didn't have the same issue I had but I'm gonna say what issues I had.1. When the game starts up, on the battle of  Kashyyk, the audio started off EXTREMELY off balance. You could barely hear either voices or music thanks to the sound effects and this was all on normal settings in the audio option2. When facing the jedi as vader, the camera is locked away from where the battle suppose to be, making it difficult to actually see what's happening (I beat him, he's not ment to be hard anyways)3. This is more of the issue from the fps unlocker but some reason you'd constantly levetate anything upwards, making the use of the force annoying4. The break on the cammel's back, When fighting the jedi on the space station, the audio gave up and just died. Literally it gave up and no audio was coming out. I though there was something wrong with my hardware but it turns out it wasn't cause a cutscene to interrupt the boss fight played and there were sound.Yea, I rage quit afte that but after seeing this kind of problem, I should have known that playing this on the pc would be a bad idea to the point I'm pretty scared to see how the 2nd game (Force Unleashed II) would perform if the first game had this slew of problems.I really don't recommend this game to anyone unless you are covered in good luck to not run into this landfill of bugs.

												Honestly while i enjoyed playing this game around the time of the original release of the game (On my ps2 of which i played even up to when i bought this from time to time,which varied in content though the plot obviously was still pretty similar though didnt quite live up to my hopes for this game) There is a summary at the bottom if you dont want to read through the whole thing.Combat issues: I figured that i would give this a try see what was new with the ultimate sith edition,but honestly i felt especially with lightsaber combat it just wasnt very well done,felt almost like turn based combat in some ways (though admittedly that could just be minor lag from my computer) and seemed like i could only focus on one-two enemies at a time. This was somewhat irritating for ranged combat when i couldnt move and block when got a constant fire on me. (Minor issue that if timed right wasnt too bad,but still certainly took away from the smoothness of the game) Bonus mission issues: With the mission where you go to the jedi temple for trials,just felt underdone. You kill a few enemies on the way there but thats about it,wasnt expecting a ton of things but it was literally just go here,lift it up,do the same thing on the other side and walk acrossed,just keep the ball on line and a fight where you literally just had to use a simple maneuver to break through his guard and push him off the edge repeatedly and your done.This area was included in the version i had played originally and included various boss fights and added to the story such as one took on the form of juno for parts of the fight which starkiller reacted to accordingly. The little ending video i will confess i thought was great though and added to the story in a positive way towards his reluctance to completely relinquish his ties to the dark side and fear that vader would always have a hold on him and served as a vision of sorts towards the dark side ending to the game itself. The Tatooine mission was alright though lacked a sense of story to it beyond just that basic stuff given away at the start of the mission,the inclusion of proxy was unnecessary and did not contribute anything to the story as it didnt tell you how he got there,it was interesting to fight Ben Kenobi though.But with the Boba Fett fight again it just felt very easy. Then there was the Hoth mission,which was nothing more then a follow up to the Tatooine mission,and like tatooine it served as a ""what if"" but beyond that added nothing,you fight luke but thats really about it. None of them contained any real sort of puzzles beyond just paying attention to the game.Other Issues: The biggest thing i noticed when comparing this to the game i had played years previous to this was the difference in customization. the positives to this ones was the many variations of armor appearences though most were other characters that anyone looking to play through on a more story based gamestyle likely wouldnt use,but had a few custom gears that were pretty cool. As for lightsaber customization it still had the power crystals though they didnt feel very diverse or add any effects visually to the saber (Minor issue) the color crystals i was pleased with but there really wasnt too much they could do to screw that up beyond a rainbow crystal (A part of me just died imagining that) Biggest issue with customization was the total lack of any sort of modification to the hilt whatsoever.Overall this really just wasnt worth buying unless you had never played the game before and just want to see what force unleashed is. The side missions did nothing for the story and were just a couple bonus fights that took very little time to complete with the exception of the temple mission which as i mentioned there was a more extensive version included in the regular force unleashed i bought years prior to playing the sith edition. lost hilt customization entirely but there is crystal customization. The combat was not something i enjoyed very much though could still complete my objective without much trouble. Boss fights were done pretty well,though sadly lost a few in this version for the main story. This did however feature several various types of storm troopers i did not see in the regular. The game is adequate at best in my opinion and for every gain with this i feel there the loss of something as well.			",12,1,0,7,0,0,0

												It's a port from a console, and it's not a very good one either.Default 30 fps lock, altough it can be modded to be 60 fps.Menu navigation is not supported for mouse, and the keyboard layout cannot be changed.Option menu is extremely limited, for changing the graphics you have to tick a single checkbox.Menu graphics are obviously meant for consoles, but for PC screens, they're way too huge. (And a pain to navigate)The game CAN get enjoyable at some parts, but most of the time it feels tiresome to play it. The sore need for a save after a risky, long battle can get especially tiresome, since if you die after the battle, you will be spawned back to the last checkpoint.This especially comes up when fighting bosses. Just about to kill a boss in your last breath, but only manage to die and start it almost all over again.Bosses are a spam to play, sometimes even outright annoying with the limited saving capabilities you have, and are sometimes even unfair. (ex. You can only hit the boss once per combo, while the boss can punch through your defences and ruthlessy spam it)If you like QTE's you might actually like this one a lot.TL;DR Game portrays you as a powerful jedi and falls on spam tactics and QTEs.

												This game sucks. Combat system is terrible, force abilities are thrown into the game with♥♥♥♥♥♥dynamic. Played through the first few levels and just can't take anymore. ""Bosses"" are terrible, un-blockable damage that at often time doesn’t make sense. Like when a giant roaring (yeah, whys a giant pile of scrap roaring?) robot made of scrap slams the ground, it hits me from 50 yards away while on a elevated position.Combat in this game consists of running around mashing keys while using force powers with complete carelessness. As fun as it sounds to run around with a lightsaber and slash and kill everything you see. When you never have to worry about your health. Really makes the game boring.This is a game for small children. ",37,1,0,4,0,0,4

												If this game would have been made today, it would be a great game. The fighting is fresh and cool and you have plenty of powers and abilities and combos to keep the gameplay nice and progressive. The problem with this game lies in the details.  There are alot of quicktime event, and they suck. The animations are great sure but quicktime events is a bad thing in itself and these are often hard to start because you are already spamming the buttons when it starts so you almost always fail the first time you try. Some missions are just painful, the worst was the mission where you have to bring a Star destroyer with the force but 6-7 tie fighter keep shooting at you, you then have to destroy them and continue destroying the ship(which takes a while) but the mission is very badly made and very very hard, way too hard in fact since more than half the time I tried to pick the ties with the force(you can only use the force to destroy them) it dosent work and they just pass through your grip and ♥♥♥♥ you up. Its a great game, but if you are easily frustrated like me, dont buy it unless its very very cheap and you dont mind getting stuck somewhere 4 hours while almost falling to the Dark side in real life.Tl;Dr: This game is so frustrating that I almost fell to the dark side playing it.

												I wanted to like this game but it's just awful.Controls are terrible unresponsive. You can't target by yourself, camera is fixed in boss battles so targeting is even worse. It takes many tries to dash constantly. When you fall it takes long time to stand up and sometimes enemies will spam attacks while you're there.Also, the player is supposed to be and overpowered force wielder but in the end I don't feel that way. At the same time you get more powers, enemies get the right way to counter them, especially bosses. They will block instantly when you push a button. It's frustrating and kind of hilarious because you feel like controling both characters at same time, one attacking and one blocking.By the way, the ligthsaber feels like you're beating enemies with a stick instead of slicing them with grace.I played the second one and I have to say that even though it's shorter it's much better game.

It turns into button mashing in QTE and even throught the game is short, you just dont want to play it. The story tries, but fails almost everywhere, mostly because  of main character who is probably the least sympathetic hero ever made, he reveals as arrogant whiny obnoxious ♥♥♥♥♥, I hate him so much.

I am not sure if this is due to a poor port or from too new of hardware (r7 260x) - Water graphics on level 2 are super buggy - Have had enemies randomly disappear while still attacking meEnemies randomly fall overUsing the keyboard is quite horrible, with some combinations really hard to pull off with default mapping -Updating the key mapping does not reflect the keys to press in-game. Be careful with those quick time events!Can... not... skip... any... cut... scenes...Terrible menu system. Remember: use the [ ] keys if you want to quit\ when in the menu.Force throwing object is hit and miss... quite literally >:(Sounds are missing from the last 2 levels (it is 2015 and it is still not fixed!?!?)The ending of the 2nd to last level is INSANELY HARD!!! You really need a controller for this partConclusion:Play this for the memories and for star wars enjoyment. If you hate bugs, then this is not a good game for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played the intro and turned it off because the camera is pretty awful with a gamepad. I will try again but the camera needs to be adjusted with the bumpers it seems. It doesn't tell you that you can adjust the camera with R3 which I have found is apparently an option. Perhaps it is just the tutorial which is lacking somewhat, I hope it gets better but it's not promising. It's really disappointing because the only Star Wars game I have fallen in love with is the arcade machine from the 80's. I may well be wrong and will hopefully be able to amend this once I have played some more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story is good and the graphics are decent enough for a 2008-2009 game, but this doesn't nake up for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay. If you are expecting a next-gen jedi knight II or jedi academy, look elsewhere. Flinging stormtroopers around and electrocuting them gets old very fast, some parts are boring and underwhelming, it has an inconsistent difficulty and the biggest challenges are the camera and the autotargeting. Thanks God that i got it  in a bundle with a good discount that has jewels like KOTOR 1&2 or the Jedi Knight series.			",27,1,0,3,0,0,1

												In porting from consoles, they couldn't even be bothered to make a UI _INSIDE_THE_GAME_ to change keybinds. Then when you start up the game, a window pops up to tell you that even though they know you set other keybinds, the defaults are what will appear on screen for tutorials/etc.That's enough for me to wish I'd never bought this POS, it's been a while but I'm pretty sure I then struggled with setting the correct resolution also. I can only speculate as to the further horrors which must await with further exposure.Play it on whatever console it was originally♥♥♥♥♥♥into the world I guess, but don't buy this expecting an experience which even remotely gives the impression that the developers and publishers care in the least about not making it a painful experience, or your own satisfaction for that matter.

												I really liked this game when I was younger; I had the PS2 version and I played the PS3 version a couple of times at friends' houses. The game itself is really fun: you play as an incredibly powerful force user, and the plot and characters, while not the best, are good enough to hold the gamplay together into a cohesive, fun game. But shame, because it's ported so poorly that it is nigh unplayable. The background has some wierd mirroring kaleidscope effect that prevents you from seeing anything further than a few paces away from you. I tried playing anyway, but some segments require that you deal with far away foes, and those parts cannot be done. Don't buy this game, it can't be played in its current state, and it's very unlikley this issue will ever be fixed.			",73,10,1,15,15,0,3

												The ultimate power fantasy! If you're wanting to let off some steam, this is the perfect game for you. If you're looking for a challenging game, look somewhere else. This game is super easy. All enimies are no match against you (bosses can go by faster than you can blink) and a lot of collectables stick out like a sore thumb. As for the story line; this game explains what happened between episodes 3 and 4 with an alternate timeline that has you dominating Tatooine and Hoth. Wheather you like it or not is up to you.Overall the game is fun but lacks the difficulty that makes games enjoyable.			",89,13,1,6,3,2,0

												In the broad spectrum of available Star Wars games that provide a Jedi/Sith experience, this game falls near the bottom.  The story is surprising good, gives a believeable bridge between the end of Episode 3 and Episode 4.  Familiar characters, interersting planets, decent diaglogue, and provides a story that you actually WANT to progress through.  But this is a video game, so it's not just sit back and enjoy and this is where the problems start. The gameplay itself is clunky at best.  Controls feel like you are playing from a distance.  The view and movement seem to work alright, but aiming any time of force ability is near impossible.  With how frequently this game requires the use of force manipulation, this is a serious problem.  It's difficult to aim any objects, and force moves tend to be useless unless aimed well which on any respectable difficulty tends to not give enough time.  The world itself, is wrought with bad physics.  Its very easy to slash an enemy off a ledge, but the game allows you to follow them off the edge with a mid slash.  It forces you to avoid ledges and high places (And there are MANY).  The lightsaber is unsatisfying as there are no ""combos"" to speak of uinless combing with the force.  Recovering from hits, explosions, or force moves takes longer than it should so in a multi enemy environment you have to be extremely conservative.  Boss fights are another point of contention.  Instead of the typical 3rd person view, the world expands and you are left with a 4th wall type view (similar to how the Lego games are played; small camera movement but its mostly fixed and you travel through a roughly round arena and move forward and back.)  Its an odd choice, and makes it even MORE difficult to effectively use the force against your opponent.   Boss fights tend to be hack and slash, finishing with a combo push X button X times, then push Y button, then quickly push Z button and if you miss the sequence you lose and take damage and do it again.  Very arcadey.  The upgrade system, despite trying to be a little more RPG-esque is limited.  You unlock points slowly, and you unlock skills to BE unlocked slowly.  Seems like you should just automatically unlock them as you go as it's a pain to pause, go to the menu (Forced to use the keyboard as there is no mouse support on menus), and select the skill you want to spend on.  Most of which seem more vanity items. I'd say with the option to play games like KOTOR for the RPGish style, or Jedi Outcast/Jedi Academy this game just doesn't compare.  Those games provide very pointed and well polished experience.  This game has serious view/control issues which translate to gameplay and force use being next to maddening.  The physics and level design is just unremarkable and worse than it should be.  Controls are ported which is unfortunate, and the menu system will drive you mad.  The story drew me in enough, that I uninstalled the game but ventured to youtube and found a full ""movie"" of the cutscenes and a little gameplay so it turned the game into a movie.  I'd recommend you do the same, the game just doesn't live up to what I was hoping for.			",113,7,6,3,10,1,9

-Disclaimer-Hey, Hey you... Yes you, the person who's about to thumbs down my review. Did you notice that I actually LIKE the game? Just because I didn't recommend the game didn't mean I didn't enjoy it.This game fell right between the lines of ""recommend"" and ""not recommend"" and that's a sign to me that most people probably would rather play something else. You're welcome to disagree with me, but at least comment to tell me why. -Quick Review-Ever want to blast people with ""UNLIMITED POWER""? Like the idea of picking up stormtroopers and throwing them into the abyss? Have you ever wanted to try mixing lightsaber moves with various force techniques?...Then this... ....MIGHT... ...be the game for you? -Detailed breakdown review- Story: you play as Starkiller, Darth Vaders Secret apprentice. Star killers been put into a twisting story of nearly constant betrayal, being a spy and agent for Lord Vader tends to have that effect on you.Starkiller's soul purpose is to hunt down the enemies of the empire and bring them to justice, Starkiller learns various force and lightsaber techniques to assist him in his hunt. The story takes place after the clone wars, but before the first Death Star is fully constructed.You can play through the story in maybe 6-12 hours, depending on how much extra collecting you do and difficulty you play on. The game also does the cheap fork-story-ending, so you need to go back and make your choice over again, if you want to see both endings. Game Play: This is where the game hurts... sometimes literally.this game was designed to be played with a controller, but even with a controller the game is a mess, the camera is tricky, targeting is terrible, you need to spend a majority of the first few levels learning simply how to pick up the correct object (since it's linked to which way Starkiller is facing, INSTEAD OF MY CAMERA. Sheesh) To be quite blunt and fair, the controls of this game are a very good reason for people to steer clear and spend their money on a game they might actually enjoy playing. However this game did have great potential, and brought a lot of great concepts, but it definitely needed more work before it was released.To talk really briefly about the various attacks, you have force lightning, force push, lightsaber attack, and block. There are various combinations of these four to make up your combat type in the game. The game seems to prefer you supplement your lightsaber strikes with force moves, instead of going full blown Master Yoda mode.There is one final thing to say about the Game Play... Screw Quick Time events. They don't NEED to be bad, but they are in this game. You'll also have them memorized; it gets repetitious fast.  Achievements: There were achievements on the Xbox version, there might be achievements some time but as of now there are none (03/19/15). We should probably count ourselves lucky. However, the accomplishments, unlockables and extra's are still in the game so you still can obtain them, if you so desire. Price I purchased The Force Unleashed: Ultimate Sith Edition from a humble bundle, so naturally I suggest waiting for sales before purchasing. The standard price for The Force Unleashed on steam is $19.99. Not a fair price, in my opinion. I will be squeezing out more hours of the game doing the extra content. Conclusion: I don't know that I can really recommend this game for anyone who ISN'T already a star wars fan, if you knew nothing of the franchise, or just simply didn't care one way or another, this game is a skip for you.If you happen to consider yourself the avid Star Wars nerd/fan you'll probably be able to overlook the games follies and enjoy watching/playing/listening to the story of Starkiller.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update April 11, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for The Force Unleashed IIAdded a Disclaimer			",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												It's a fun game, but the interface is clumsy, failing to take into account the existence of the mouse in the menus, requiring arrow button navigation, and the audio quality is unreliable. A frequently encountered problem is the music only coming out of the left speaker/headphone and sound effects that should be surround failing miserably. No options exist in-game to fix the problem.  Overall great premise, but shoddy execution. Research hardware compatibility before buying. Seems to have the most audio issues with Creative sound cards.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about force unleashed? This is a hard one to review because I have not been able to finish this. I'm not one to claim to be a great video game player. I play most of my linear style games on easy / medium settings and I look for more plot and direction of the story. A good story can often overcome some bugs and glitches or bad game mechanics.Not with this game. This is a bad game. Its not often I will say this but this is a game to avoid. When you are introduced to the story, there is so much hope and promise, But unfortunately the rest of the game gets in the way. The gameplay is unpolished. The mechanics are boring and repetitive. What looks like it could be a well thought out fight mechanic quickly turns into button mashing adventure of whack a mole, as computer controlled oponents constantly spawn and run at you. The AI is terrible as most enemies will stand there and take it. UNfortunately, The Enemy AI, being extremely weak is compensated for by boss fight mechanics that are repeitively annoying. We're not talking about, 5-10 moves that are varied up. Most enemy bosses will come at you with no more than 2-3 moves. Often will just stun / slam you into a corner or invisible wall (more on thos later!) and repeat that for 20 or so seconds while you watch in disbelief unable to even interact with your character. Many enemies have artificial buffs to try and counter you. They are extremely one dimension. SOme are immune to force. Some autoblock lightsabers. Some can't get shoved, some cant get electrocuted. it seems artificial and fake. The gameplay itself is extremely 1 directional. You follow the path forward at all points. This isn't necessarily bad for a platformer. I tend to like directed story games. But this one isn't good. You're often rudely interrupted while running for cutscenes that are abrupt and out of place. The paths look like you might have multiple ways of going, but you quickly find that they are just invisible walls and that your direction is set no matter what.The biggest offender though of the game mechanics? the overuse, constantly abusing you with QUicktime events. If it's a non standard enemy. So, Any AT_T walkers, rancor, or the like, which come more and more frequently as you progress, will end with a Quicktime event. You will do thousands of them. And they're not short either. many of them taking 20-30 seconds of watching you kill the enemy with some completely arbitrary, pre-scripted event that has nothing to do with the way you fight in game and acts as a complete disconnect to the battle system.Then you get to the worst boss battle in any star wars game I can ever recall. Perhaps one of my least liked boss battles ever. The Star Destroyer. Combine all that is wrong in this game, add in broken gameplay mechanics, incorrect instructions on screen and constant waves of enemies that are timed on purpose to prevent you from finishing this boss quickly, I just gave up.And just when you thought it can't get worse. it does. The Camera system is frustrating. it does not always follow you smoothly from behind and during many fights, you will find it swinging widly around, changing how your character responds to your button presses. Then Boss fights introduces brand new camera mechanics. It attempts to emulated a 1v1 side scrolling fighter, but horribly. The camera finds a fixed position off in the distance and just shows you the ""map"" you are to fight in. Except, the controls don't lend well to this view and you will find yourself runing into walls and posts and getting stuck with things in your feet between you and your foe, making most boss fights a fight against the camera, not the enemyThis game, with only a few hours played ahs become oen of the least enjoyable experience I have ever had in the star wars universe. My final rating is a 1/10 stars. or whatever rating you want to give it. I recommend reading the story on wiki instead of wasting your money, time, and frustrating emotional outbursts on just how terrible this game is. Avoid at all costs. I have deleted this game from my steam library. I never intend to play it again nor the second.			",72,12,0,10,6,0,5

												Don't expect anything more than mindless gameplay. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing considering sometimes that is exactly what people need to relax. It is worth sharing with a friend or getting it during one of steams infamous sales, otherwise it is largely ignorable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the worst port I have ever had the misfortune of playing. I remeber playing this on the Wii back in the day and belive me I never though I would recomend the Wii version of a game over the PC version, but the Wii version is a lot better. That being said this game suffers from lousy controls, terrible graphics\sound options and it might as well be called loading screen simulator. All in all unless it comes in the Star Wars Bundle or you know what your getting into DO NOT BUY THIS GAME			",89,9,3,9,7,2,10

												One of the poorest quality PC ports available on Steam. Control and video options have to be set in a launcher outside the game, and the options available in-game are barebones, not even including an option for subtitles in-game, let alone cutscenes.Combat is unnecessarily difficult. The lock-on key is useless, and force powers are extremely difficult to aim. Lifted enemies and objects fly in crazy directions that don't seem to take any input from keys pressed or mouse movements. Boss battles add to the frustration, as bosses can shrug off force powers and lightsaber attacks with impunity, and often seem to be completely invincible during scripted movement and combat sequences.Even on my relatively nice gaming rig (GTX 680 x2, i7 3820 @3.6Ghz, 32Gbs RAM) this game suffers constant stuttering, and  odd split-second flashes of other scenes when using some force powers and lightsaber attacks.Just from a technical standpoint this game is a failure, but the ridiculous (and unfortunately canon) storyline only pushes this pile of garbage further into the ""forgetful"" realm of gaming. It's hard to choke down even as an avid Star Wars fan.-5/10			",104,7,0,10,17,0,26

												I loved all Dark Forces games (actually, first Dark Forces is definitely one of the best game I ever played). I thought that this one will be like Jedi Academy but...it's not. I finished at second boss and ihave no intention to complete because it's kinda boring. Force grip is cool thing but overall combat is chaotic and playing also on controller is frustrating.

												Well this is my first ""NO"" review. Since the beginning the game was a 6.5 for me...but i finish the game 100% so i could give an objective review.Playtime:16hours on ""hard"" (including the 3 campaigns of the sith edition, ~1h each).First thing you will see in this game is that this will consume pretty 30GB in your disc (SWU 2 will consume just 10)...One of the most annoying issues of the game is that you can't skip some cut scenes... but when you want to take an screenshot (or even push the volume key)... ""BANG"" the cut scene is gone... so... WTF? (i'm a screenshot fan so this is a ""turn down"").Graphics are amazing, and have a nice story... but i'll recommend this game only to SW fans... if you are looking for a good  and cool hack&slash game, just keep looking and save 20 bucks. game is too easy, you are more focus in the secrets than the enemies and ""sith edition"" doesn't have anything special more than those 20GB extra in your disc (3 campaigns of 50min each? come on).So why 6.5? here we go: -Graphics 10/10 (graphics are awesome, i had fun taking in-game screenshots)-Music 7/10 (music of all sw games... is that good? yes, but makes a hack&slash boring sometimes)-History 9/10 (to bad is not cannon)-Controls 10/10 (respond fine, but have to separate this from ""combos/mobility"")-AI 4/10(AI sucks like hell, enemies can stand in front of you without doing anything... on hard difficulty)-Difficulty 4/10 (extremely easy, on hard difficulty. enemies are stupid and main character is too OP)-Camera 7/10 (can get stuck a few times, but nothing to be worry)-Combos/Mobility 4/10 (even if controls are good, combos kinda sucks and mobility can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ your character can just layout in the ground while he's being shoot)-Menu 6/10 (simple that's good... but mediocre...)-Re playability 4/10 (the game is too easy, there's nothing special that lead you to play it again)Total: 6.5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gameplay- The Force Unleashed's main goal was to make the player feel like they are a sith lord, being able to use different, powerful force based attacks. In that aspect the game delivers, but this all gets boring after a while, as combat is rediculousy easy, I'm sure anyone can beat the game without upgrading too much. Combat is not satifying at all, as you find yourself killing waves and waves of enemies without trying. During the second part of the game different variants of storm troopers arrive, in order to kill them you have to use a particular technique, this gets boring FAST. Most boss fights are pretty lame as well, as many of the bosses limit or restrict your uses of the force powers, or they require constant button mashing. This makes the boss fights boring and not rewarding, a good example of a well designed boss fights would be the colossuses in Shadow Of The Colossus, all the bosses were unique. Mr Freeze from Batman Arkham city would be another one, as Freeze adapts to your attacks, evades, and movements. It was a multi step fight with out lame QTE sequences or out of placed cutsences, which were everywhere in The Force Unleashed.Story- The story is mediocre, which is really sad because the Star Wars universe is very interesting. The main character Galen Marek is very dull, and has no emotions, a good comparison to Marek would be Connor from Assasin's Creed III, which is not a good thing. Other characters are not much better etheir, everyone just seemed so boring and unteresting. The missions are not much better ethier, they all feel the same, as you slaughter waves and waves of enemies. level design was flawed, as many of the levels looked very similar and were boring to play through. The Force Unleashed has two endings, both were terrible, the good ending being a little bit better than the bad one, but thats not saying much at all. In the end you find yourself not being able to make any decisions as the game does that for you, but it really does not matter as the build up and the characters along the way were boring and painfully average.Overall opinion- The Force Unleashed is game made only for Star Wars fans, if you want a hack and slash game, go ahead and buy DMC, it's much better than this. If you desire a game that explores the lore and mythos of Star Wars, this not the game for you etheir. The people that would enjoy the Force Unleashed would be hardcore star wars fans and people that want a easy game where you feel like a god. At the end of the day Star Wars The Forced Unleashed is a disappointing  game, it could have been great but instead it fell short, The Force Unleashed is not a terrible game, but it's not a good one etheir.Rating- 6/10 Average game.

												Bad case of consolitis. Avoid this poor port.Playing with physics is kind of fun for a while, even if it's pretty floaty. However, you have to endure bad controls, buggy sound, bad camera and general bugginess to do so. And quick time events, lots of those. AI gets itself killed in lots of embarrasing ways in some arenas. Some puzzles and boss battles feel like sisyphean tasks because you are fighting the controls as much as the enemies.Story is decent if you ignore the over the topness.			",244,62,1,46,36,5,47

												I'm a fan of Star Wars and I have played a lot of Star Wars games, This is one of the worst. This game is a Like God of War type button mashing combat game. A lot of similar mechanics are used like quick time events to kill bigger enemies and button combonations to encourage chaining attacks for maximum damage. The QTE part of the game feels kind of flat and not as epic as some games have been able to make it, and the combos are for the most part useless. The hordes of enemies that come at you either wont live past the first couple of hits or can just not get hit some how. Boss battles consist of fighting jedi (so far, it changes later on but I don't think I'm going to finish this game) and some of these battles can be really tough because Jedi can just cancle what you're doing or not be effected by your attack. This makes the boss battles really boring and annoying.The good news is that the story is kind of neat, although it is badly done through the cutscenes in the game, so here what I suggest you do, if you're interested in this game, go buy the book. I did a long time ago and it's awesome. Save yourself the time of trying to get through this horribly broken game.			",118,28,0,12,6,0,11

												This is with out a doubt, the WORST star wars game ever created. The storyline is trash, the voice actors are all incredibly annoying, and the camera angles are something straight out of the third circle of hell. Then theres the god aweful targeting system. Unless what your trying to electrocute is right in front of you, dont expect your character to pay much attention to what your aiming for. all of the movements in this game seem very slow, and it's at the point that the ai seem to fall over just trying to walk that you wonder if they copied the movements of a toddler learning to walk. Occasionally there is supposed to be sound, but it seems like the developers over looked that part. sure, it's not the biggest deal breaker, but if you're already flat out heated about something, it'll make you question the drugs you were on when you purchased this utter trash. If you have a high sensitivity mouse such as a corsair rgb or a deathadder, be prepaired to lower your dpi to its lowest levels. This is due to the stupid camera that occasionaly likes to hyper look ion the wrongest angle possible. Getting back to gameplay, if your character takes even the slightest hit, he will freeze, put up his hands and write ''shoot me, I'm open"" on his chest. he will do NOTHING to attempt to save himself, but crawl shakily to his knees. Possibky one of the worst games I've ever played, and I played E.T			",61,6,3,4,4,0,10

												Do not get this game. Oh my god, no. I played this a long time ago as a kid and saw it on sale yesterday and thought ""Wow, how cool! Ultimate Sith edition? Heck yeah i'm gonna waste $4.99 on this game!"" I downloaded it overnight and played it today. I was more than disappointed.First off, the mouse and keyboard controls are slow and don't make much sense when it comes to the pause menu. The attacks are slow, and combat basically comes down to who can click the fastest. But that's not even the worst part of the game. The worst part is the background.When you first start you play as Vader, storming through Kashyyyk and slaughtering Wookies. Only you notice that something is off; You know that old Windows error and when the thing pops up and you try to move it, it just makes copies of itself wherever it was, making a long trail of error windows? Yeah, that's what the background does. It's incredibly distracting and impossible to play with. When you get to invading Ram Koda's space station and you enter the hanger bay, all you see are TIE Fighter wings. It just fills your screen because of the way the background glitches.Now it may be possible that this is a hardware issue on my part. Granted, I don't have the greatest gaming PC. But it meets the specs required to play it on the highest settings, and I figured since the game was fairly old my laptop could run it no sweat. Not the case in the slightest. This thing eats up RAM like nothing else. If there were someone I could contact to get my money back you'd better believe I'd get in touch with them, because I'm certain with this Winter Sale going on I could buy a much better game with that $4.99 I wasted on this garbage. In short, this game is buggy and hardly deserves to be called a game. Do not get this			",43,1,0,2,1,0,1

												Honestly, one of the worst hack in slashes i have ever played. I beat it once before i ps3, rebought this thinking it was two, made a mistake. Regardless, i remember it being a very fun game, but i just replayed it and had a terrible timeIt is clanky. The lock on is trash. No combo depth. Pretty much no combos. The invinsibilty frames when you are knocked down, so you just keep getting knocked down over, and over without having a chance to get up. All the ""Harder"" characters just poise through everything and continuesly knock you down. you have to resort to the same moves. Trying to force grab a lot of objects gets you killed. The level design started nicely, but began to get boring as you see the same enviorments over and over. I personaly play a lot of hack and slashes, but this one is absolutely terrible. I lost on the same stage, the end stage in one spot, just because i kept getting shot with missles and couldn't move. I don't suggest this to anyone. I paid only 3 bucks, and regret even spending that.			",79,15,0,4,2,0,3

												I'll keep this short.The force unleashed is an absolutely brilliant game for the first run however doesn't have much replayability, any complaints about how the game is bad by people who are replaying the game are likely because the story is horrible to re-play to the point where you find yourself noticing the smallest details wrong with the game. which is why even though I found the same issues this is a bad review not because of those issues but instead because there are No Graphics options.Allow me to restate that actually. there are three graphics options.BrightnessResolutionHigh DetailAnd High detail is a freaking tick box.Essentially because of this if you buy the game and have some kind of graphical issue, well you bought the wrong game and if those three tiny options don't fix it for you too bad, you're on your own.

												This is a review of the extra DLC included in the Ultimate Sith Edition, as I’ve played the main game on a Xbox 360 back in the day and decided that i would finish up the game's DLC on pc. This review will only cover the DLCs, if you like me haven't played them and are considering buying this game just for those, otherwise check out the other reviews for an overlook at the core game.Before we go into the DLC, i have to say, this game has only and i mean ONLY! 1 single settings for graphics and that is a tick option before you launch the game “High Detail”, that’s all, you can set your resolution but you can’t tune the game to run as good as possible with your hardware, before anything make sure your hardware can run this game, because there is no options to help your system along. Second BIG complaint is that the game is locked at 30 frames per second, this can be unlocked with a hack you can easily find online if you search for “force unleashed fps unlocker” this would have to be launch separately, I’m unsure if your time played would be recorded on your steam profile.If you’ve played this game on consoles, you would have gotten accustomed to achievements and such, this port has none of those, there are even cheat codes you can use to unlock the costumes in-game, I can’t see why you would bother collecting everything on pc as there is no meaningful reward. I’ve played with a Xbox one controller, I’ve heard terrible things from people using keyboard and mouse, so be sure you have a controller ready, I do not know if you can use a PlayStation controller, you’ll have to look that up yourself.And one more thing you’ll have to be aware of, this game has to, frustratingly so, it has to load in-between menus, now I don’t just mean from main menu to game menu, I mean every. Single. Time. You change any menu, if you don’t have a fast storage device, consider the awful long loading time you’ll have to go through in-between menus.Now with all that out of the way I will now start with the dlc. Most of it is pure fan service, if you like fan service then this might be for you, if you don’t like main characters appearing randomly then this is defiantly not for you. There are a total of 3 DLC missions, each on a different planet with a different nostalgia setting. They all are about 15-30min all depending on how well you get around the level and if the game doesn’t bug out on you, which did happen to be me on the Jedi temple mission, I had to bend a bridge upwards, but the game just wouldn’t respond. I had to respawn, not once, not twice, but three times before the game would even react, this was without the fps unlocker.The first mission gives you all the powers unlocked, absolutely everything at your disposal, the second mission however takes a step back for whatever reason and starts the mission with most of everything unlocked, you can still level and unlock skills, but the menu loading didn’t make me feel like that was worth my time and even it was, the last mission had everything unlocked anyways so there isn’t really any reason to wait around the loading screen.The enemies are tedious at best, if this DLC was meant to make me feel like I was the “Ultimate Sith” then I have to take my hat off, it did no such thing. Constantly I felt like the enemies were designed to block my powers and the annoying amount of snipers on each level only made me feel like I had to run past all the enemies instead of fighting them to avoid getting frustrated.Each mission ends with a boss fight, featuring one of your beloved Star Wars characters fighting you, I didn’t enjoy any of them, they feel like they only were there as fan service and not the good kind, this is some of the worst fan service I’ve seen in a long while. Be prepared for a lot of the iconic Star Wars scenes recreated with poor enemies and poor puzzles in them, talking about iconic, the iconic Star Wars rolling text in the beginning of the movies is also in some of the missions, unskippable though and they aren’t particularly interesting either.My favorite mission out of the three was the very last one on Tatooine, you’ll meet plenty of familiar faces in this mission and even a silly boss fight at the end. I liked this mission the most because of the variety of locations you’re in, don’t get me wrong, you’re still on Tattoine, but at least it doesn’t look like the same corridors with the same enemies.My conclusion is this, if you are really into Star Wars to the point where you’ll take anything with that name stamped onto it, then this DLC is for you, if you want a quality product that you can be proud to show off to your fellow Star Wars fanatic friends, then this is not for you, heck even if you just like good games, this is defiantly not for you either.

												Seriously one of the most annoying games I've played in quite a while.The port is atrocious, the plot is cheap and stale, the controls are especially abysmal. You'll find yourself redoing certain sections of the game over and over again while dying stupidly because of unresponsive controls and combos that drive you off the map.It does has some nice features (for SW fans), but I strongly suggest you try out Jedi Outcast and/or Jedi Academy for a better SW Jedi Knight gaming experience.

												Horrible port, bugged and at several points nearly unplayable. The Xbox 360-Controllersupport is only referring to first gen controllers, so if you've got the far more common later ones, you are screwed. The whole game however is very clearly designed with a controller in mind, so playing this with your keyboard will be extremly hard. Only buy this if you are a hardcore fan, otherwise this will drive you crazy.			",128,47,1,25,11,1,33

												The game's main selling point is its physics engine. It combines Havok, Euphoria (of GTA4 fame), and DMM to rather remarkable results. And for those of you who don't know, DMM is a more in depth material modelling engine. The idea being that you get objects which bend and break like their real world counterparts. Glass shatters, wood splinters, metal bends, and plants swing. And it's remarkably effective. Often it adds to the wreckless destruction your jedi powers leave in their wake, as all sorts on the sidelines gets caught in your wrath. And at other times, it's used to open doors. Two layers of steel blocking the way? Not a problem, just punch it out of the way!However it's not an open ended game. It ultimately has you navigate a linear path, which is fine. But in order to do this, it has to put up immovable barriers to keep you there. Which rather horribly juxtaposes all that dynamic damage they have going on. In fact, in order to make sure the game's still completable, there's a lot of indestructable level geometry. The only bridge across a chasm won't break, for instance. But next to the impressive DMM magic, it feels astonishingly cheap. At times, that damage engine can just feel like a gimick you get brief glimpses of, as some areas make very sparing use of it, so the game falls back on raw gameplay for enjoyment.Which brings me to the biggest problem I have with this game. The levels feel very drawn out and artificially lengthened, and get tedious quickly. Especially as fighting enemies isn't particularly fun. The infantry type enemies don't pose any real threat, leaving you only with the choice of which force power or lightsaber combo to kill them with, coupled with how cruel your sense of humor is. The boss fights are more interesting, with moves like blocking suddenly becoming useful, but even those drag on enormously.On top of that, there's a few issues with the PC version. It's locked to 30fps and the lack of detail leaves a lot of the game looking rather bleak and apocalyptic in ways it's clearly not supposed to.			",408,43,47,21,45,3,40

												No windowed mode. No way to see the PC controls if you don't use a console controller. No way to modify the PC controls if you don't use a console controller. Modifying the controls directly doesn't always work, sometimes the file reverts to the defaults. Can't alt tab or the game crashes. Can't lock on to enemies with any kind of reliability. Unskippable cutscenes. Etc etc etc... Bad bad bad. If you take away one point for everything wrong with this port: (-1192)/10 ""It's OK."" -IGN			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh God, terrific. I just had to quit playing this since I couldn't stand it anymore. It's a typical american vainilla game, just that features a jedi. It could be batman, or any other thing. You will have your robot enemies, flying enemies, exploding enemies, bosses, crappy ""puzzles"" to solve, you will have to jump over platforms, and collect boosters like invencibility, damage booster and that sort of things... Really disappointing since I'm quite fan of Star Wars.In adition it doesn't feel any like you are beeing an actual jedi (or sith). If you want to feel so, buy instead another game, Jedi Academy, which is older:The good part is the art design and the cool graphics. Nevertheless, you won't feel like you weld a real lightsaber. The lightsaber duel is so bad as well, and feels like you are playing some sort of street fighter instead of an actual duel.If you are not looking for an arcade game, I would recommend you to look for another title			",44,4,0,4,6,0,22

												Oh God, terrific. I just had to quit playing this since I couldn't stand it anymore. It's a typical american vainilla game, just that features a jedi. It could be batman, or any other thing. You will have your robot enemies, flying enemies, exploding enemies, bosses, crappy ""puzzles"" to solve, you will have to jump over platforms, and collect boosters like invencibility, damage booster and that sort of things... Really disappointing since I'm quite fan of Star Wars.In adition it doesn't feel any like you are beeing an actual jedi (or sith). If you want to feel so, buy instead another game, Jedi Academy, which is older:The good part is the art design and the cool graphics. Nevertheless, you won't feel like you weld a real lightsaber. The lightsaber duel is so bad as well, and feels like you are playing some sort of street fighter instead of an actual duel.If you are not looking for an arcade game, I would recommend you to look for another title			",44,4,0,4,6,0,22

												This game is an atrocity. Playing on any difficulty above easy is utterly impossible. The controls are horrible, inacurate, and ridiculously finnicky. Bosses are completely overpowered - you hit them 10 times and they maybe lose 1% health if the game didn't decide to ignore your last combo and one hit from the boss reduces your health by 25-75% dpending on how hard the developers decided to ♥♥♥♥ you. There are a TON of bugs and glitches, the enemy attacks don't always work, the AI is insanely aggressive and blocking is pointless. Combos are effective only once out of 100 times.The only reason I even own this game was because of the 2015 pack that went on sale a month ago that included a bunch of star wars games, but now I know why. Most of them ♥♥♥♥ing suck♥♥♥♥♥♥			",61,3,0,8,14,0,7

												This game is really great because of the diversity and interesting storyline and gameplay compared to other games of the Star Wars franchise. The only problem with it is it's transfer from console to pc is rough because of a background bug if you have Intel HD Graphics. This game requires that you have AMD and tons of other stuff to make sure it runs smoothly. Personally, The game is great but it takes to much to concetrate on the story when you are always being bugged by the background. If you have AMD then this game should work fine for you, if not this game is not worth the buy.			",46,4,0,11,4,1,1

												The force unleashed is a game that promised much but delivered little.  It fully has the potential to such a fantastic game but it falls way short due to production issues.  The game is rife with glitches, making you encounter 2-3 at least on each mission, which gets extremely annoying by the time you're halfway through.  Combat itself is extremely enjoyable, coupled with leveling up in a sense to develop new skills.  The biggest disappointment is the lack of a true Good/Evil/Neutral system...the options are fairly obvious which would be fine for an older game, but just detracts from a game as new as this one.  Overall, it's enjoyable to a mediocre degree, but not a great addition to the Star Wars universe.			",130,13,2,8,10,2,39

												So much wrong here. The controls feel like you’re spinning round an action figure rather than somebody with any weight. You find yourself being constantly being thrown around like a ragdoll and most of my deaths seemed to come from being shunted off a platform, resulting in a frustrating return to the last checkpoint. Actually the platforming in general is just annoying. The game sticks to the Star Wars universe’s famous lack of health and safety regulations, so any false step will send you plummeting down a chasm. The camera is less than helpful here and there’s an obscene number of invisible walls placed seemingly at random (jumping towards a bridge, hitting an invisible wall mid-air and sliding down into the mouth of Sarlacc was a particularly ignoble end). The story is nonsense with a painfully bland protagonist. You are meant to be uber powerful but even your force powers are unsatisfying to use, when using force grip it feels like you are wobbling an object in to place rather than showing any mastery. The only time you actually do something impressing is in the numerous quick time sequences with pop up to disrupt any sort of flow in the game. Oh and that Star Destroyer sequence from the trailer.. it’s one of the most of the most painfully terrible bits of gameplay I’ve experienced.   ",669,204,30,92,73,10,138

												I just came back to this game after a year's hiatus and got an abrupt reminder of why I stopped playing it in the first place. I just about had an aneurysm out of sheer rage while trying to finish a level I gave up on before. Lemme put things in a list.Story: Well, it's not terrible. I've seen worse writing plenty of times. It just isn't very grabbing to me. Don't take my opinion on this, though; I've never put much thought into the backstory of the Star Wars franchise.World Design/Graphics: About what I expected. Looks like a Star Wars game. Some of the expressions and character models look like they were made in Garry's Mod, but it's bearable.Physics: RUN. RUN FAR AWAY. The physics engine in this game is just god-awful. Platforming is a pain; accurately judging a jump is like trying to throw a ball whose density is constantly fluctuating. Some of the terrain is horridly rough, with smooth ground being un-walkable in random spots. Of course, none of this helps while fighting. And speaking of that...Combat: The control scheme for fighting isn't too bad. Basic combat maneuvers, such as jumping, slashing, lighting, and dodging are all on natural-feeling buttons. The AI, however, is an absolute NIGHTMARE. Enemies will constantly gang up on you, slapping you around like a pinball in combos that are infuriatingly hard to get out of: blocking and dashing while being hit are impossible. And when the guys right next to you aren't hitting you, the ones halfway across the map are picking you off with impossibly accurate potshots that must be either swatted away by the auto-deflect feature (which has about a 2% success rate) or deflected manually by holding the block button, meaning you can't do ANYTHING ELSE. Which leads to you getting beat over the skull by all those guys right next to you. Crowd control is unlocked about halfway through the game, and DUMPS your force energy gauge. No spamming the ""Get away from me!"" button.My reccommendation: Steer clear of this game. It's not worth the pain and suffering.			",125,40,2,25,18,2,10

												A MESS!!! WHAT A MESS!!!I pity those who bought the retail pc game some years ago, or those who have paid 20 bucks for this BROKEN mess; hell, I've bought this for less than 7 bucks and I regret it, lolTFU was supposed to be the super-satisfying, amazing LucasArts game of the post-06 HD generation, and hey! I'm sure the game was kind of great for consoles (mostly Xbox) but this pc ""port"" is an insult, an INSULT, pure and simple.List of offenses against pc gamers: a motion blur glitch which ruins the backdrops and severely affects gameplay in medium-hard difficulties (currently unfixable for many graphic cards), the random crash to desktop (fortunately not that common), lack of configuration options other than resolution (yes, believe it or not it's true), pause menu straight from the xbox (doesn't support mouse), limited save options (you only have ONE save file for EVERY walkthrough you may attempt, that means you won't be able to randomly replay your favourite levels once you've finished the game), 29 GB (!!!!)  for a 07-08 game that, if properly optimized, shouldn't have been more than 11; LACK of DLC for the pc version; the list goes on and on...and last but not least: shame on you Steam, this pc port isn't even worth 5 bucks, and you know itlol, do you still want to purchase, install and play this game?? you've been warnedthe game itself (the console version, I mean) is ok (6,5/10, maybe a 7): serviceable hack-n-slash, varied force-powers that, once mastered, are truly helpful, nice sound design, etc. The levels usually overstay their welcome, though. The story starts very strong but nearly collapses with a twist that is forced and makes you feel confused and full of questions...the story tries TOO HARD to be relevant to the events of the New Hope (yes, it smells of rotten retcon)...My advice= buy this on a sale and go for a quick ""easy level"" walkthrough, because what the hell, it's Star Wars; and then stick with Jedi Outcast/Academy and all those solid gold mods out there. Of course, if you own an Xbox by all means, IGNORE the pc port and buy the proper console version if you really need to play this game.RIP LucasArts, indeed			",77,6,4,12,11,0,14

												In the first level you play as Darth Vader with the ablity to Kamehameha, which destroys the environment around you. Which turns out to be made of paper, yet deadly from the slightest touch. Wookies jump off hanging bridges and trip over their own feet while Stormtroopers are rightfully confused about the whole situation.As funny as that sounds, ultimately not worth it.

												Looks great, but the controls are awful. Hitting your target with a force thrown object is basically random chance. And switching to 2D mode for boss battles makes them stupidly difficult...suddenly, all that you learned playing in the 3D mode is taken away and you're put in a platformer, only with even more broken controls; you think you're about to Force Lightning the boss, and it just fizzles right next to them. And to top it all off, there are quick time events...			",379,104,6,78,52,0,119

												No wonder there were so few Sith lords.  If they had to suffer the misery of The Force Unleashed, I'm sure they would turn their light sabers on themselves.  This game was so bad that I could not finish it, which is saying a lot.  I got to one of the final battles, and apparently my mouse sensitivity was not high enough to win the fight.  Yes, the game allows you to set a controller to the ""lose"" position.  But I had lost interest in the game long before that point.Imagine a whole galaxy of mindless foes to dispatch in creative and entertaining ways.  Got it?  Ok, leave it to your imagination.  This game will in no way match whatever enjoyment you received from your creative musings.  Instead, this game provides an opportunity to grind you way to the Sith Lord Hall of Fame with such unenjoyable features as:  braindead AI, braindead AI that's immune to your powers, Quicktime Events, backtracking, and jumping puzzles!  Hopefully you will get more enjoyment from this review than from the dreadful game that inspired it.			",401,122,17,47,26,4,67

												Windows version: 2/10Mac version: 0/10 (DO NOT BUY AT ALL, BUT ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A WINDOWS MACHINE/BOOTCAMP)Pro: Mildly interesting storyline. That's it.Cons:- Buggy graphics (especially on the mac version, where heads can disappear)- Buggy sound (on the mac version) during cutscenes- lightsabers are glowsticks. One stormtrooper needs 100 hits to die. Uninteresting combat as a whole- force powers are pretty lackluster, and half of the time you don't hit what you intended to- HUGE INSTALL (30GB), mostly of language files. Yes.

												What shines in this game is not the action, but the paused moments on the diverse worlds where the art direction shines brilliantly. If you must play this game, i do recommend playing it on easy mode and just breezing through it as you swing your glowing wiffleball bat at enemies until the next story beat. The combat is not its strong suit, its unremarkable and often very disempowering for whats supposed to be a very empowering demigod force wielding character when he is picked up by enemies like a small child and then tossed around like a rag doll and almost every single enemy has a means to block or outright be immune to basic light saber attacks, so for a majority of the time you will not be actually using your light saber. It requires mana to use combo attacks, so you will be hindered in the amount of combos you are allowed to perform over time, meaning it does not incentivise you to perform them. The horse isn't dead enough yet, because I have to talk about how awful the targetting system is, because a large amount of boss fights require you to use force powers at key moments and target flying objects that may or may not be trying to kill you, they rarely respond to targeting. You will be doing those sequences multiple times, over and over, in frustration and just wanting the ride to end, but it doesn't end, not yet, oh no, there are more QTE's to get through.

												If your ideal Star Wars game is 5 hours of repetitive button mashing on a badly ported console game, boss fights that will frustrate you to breaking keyboards, repetitive quick time events, and a main character with the charisma of a loaf of moist bread then this is the game you've been waiting for.I wanted to finish, to play out the story but I just couldn't take this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t any longer. its disappointing to think the company that made Jedi Knight, Jedi Outcast, and Jedi Academy also approved this game.On a positive note the physics engine, art, setting, and music are all 5 out of 5.

												i dont know how this game has so many recomendations, i feel obligated to tell people what its really like, hopefully it might save someone some money or time.first off, im a huge star wars fan, i started playing x-wing in 6th grade and played every star wars game since then. this game is absloutely trash, just unfinished, bad controls, glitchy graphics, etc.there are quick time events, but you cant watch whats happening, which is usually cool becuase you need to look at what button to pres next. who in their right mind thought that having a fixed camera during a boss fight is a good idea? not to mention the boss fights often spam moves like a 7th grader playing mortal combat. also its a platformer with not resposive controls is a recepie for frustration. if you like star wars do not subject yourself to this, you will regret it. from now on i will no longer play star wars games just becuase its star wars (and lucasarts which when i was growing up made incredilbly inovative products) i will take everything they put out with a healthy dose of sckeptisism. its really a shame, i just started re-playing the original dark forces, and its crazy how a game thats more than 15 years old is above and beyond this game.was there anything at all i liked? while the first level you get to play as darth vader and kill a ton of wookies, its quite fun, and sometime (in between combat) where the graphics look pretty nice			",201,29,3,19,32,1,70

Posted: May 3, 2015
												I am not usually one to hate on things, but this game is just bad, very bad...and here's why:Let's start with the list of ""would be pros"" (things that could be good about the game if the execution wasn't so terrible): - Fun combat system. Great, so many combos to use...if it wasn't for the fact that you will never use most of them. Especially the longer, most powerful combos are useless - weak enemies will be dead long before you finish them and strong ones will interrupt them 99% of the time. Also most of the stronger ones have superior power on melee range, so you'll just end up pouring electricity into them from safe distance until it stops being funny.   - Oh, wanted to list something more, but just realized that 'tis a part of the cmbat system as well. There is not really anything else in this game than combat anyway. So, okay - using the things lying around to fight. Sounds fun, right? Just tearing a block of metal from the wall with the Force and smashing it into your enemies. The hell it does! But it takes so long you cannot use it. First you have to target the object (more on targeting later, that's the stuff of nightmares). Use the pull ability on it, the slooooowly float it around, direct it on the enemies and release...there you go! Oh, damn, why am I lying on the floor with half HP gone? Something must have gone wrong in the process. The thing is you cannot move while doing this so you'll probably get hit by a missile or five before you get to the carnage part. Did I mention getting knocked off your feet interrupts the pull? So this one's a no go.That's it, my list of ""what could have been pros if better executed"" is officially over. Now for the cons:  - Characters. They have no character whatsoever. And their behavior makes absolutely no sense. No thinking being would act like that.  - Story. There is a story? Must have missed it. Kill this, kill that, kill something more. Oh, the Dark Lord betrayed us? Let's kill him as well.  - Enemies. They are plain stupid and predictable. If you don't try to use any of the longer combos or never stop to chuck some debris around, you will pretty much never get hit with anything that hurts. Which basically limits all the abilities and combos to using 3-4 things (out of dozens) over and over again. - Boss fights. The camera turns into a 1990 abomination during those. And the winner of our ""worst thing about The Force Unleashed"" contest is (without any competition to speak of) the targetting system. You have no crosshair, no cursor or anything to pick a target. You just look in the general direction and hope the game picks the one you want. Normally it's pretty much a 50/50 thing, so it is still playable. But during the boss fights, with the atrocious camera, targeting becomes nothing short of abysmal. Most of the fight you spend running in circles around your enemy in a hopeless strive to target him/her. Mostly you hit things just by accident - when you aren't even trying to. Blocking their abilities is even worse, because you often have only around half a second to target them. I consider myself a patient person - I don't have a problem with repeating something I did wrong many times over until I get it right. Well, I'm also very stubborn, so I will keep trying even if it meant dying for the whole day. But this...this almost made me quit the game a couple times. Not because of the dying, but because I knew I didn't do anything wrong, just the mechanics are atrocious. Now that I've finished it I wish I rather quit. Not worth the time even if it was free.

Product received for free
												I feel like this game is good, but it's missing a lot of things.Pro's of the game:-It's Star Wars, and it's still The Force Unleashed, even if it differs from the other versions.-You get basically all of the extra outfits and DLC (Afterall, it is Ultimate Sith Edition)-It has a lot of fun features. You just run around, slice everyone up and use different force powers to unleash chaos. I feel like it can be challenging at times, but depending on what difficulty you choose, it's never unmanagable.-I imagine that most computers, even potato computers can run this on at least low settings.Con's of the game:-Ported. The controls aren't very smooth, and using the force to throw people into eachother or do complex stuff is sort of hard.-Capped at 30FPS unless you use mods-No windowed mode. You can only play it in full screen-They took out a lot of the content from the other versions. For example, I don't think the levels with the Jedi Temple exist. Also, they either changed some of the levels or made them different. They replaced a lot of the enemies in the other versions as well. There aren't Navy Commandos, or medics, or really a whole ton of the same enemies from the PS2 version. Also, I might be wrong on this as well but it seems like there are less collectibles to find, such as the Lightsaber crystals.-Graphics aren't really extremely good, even on high settings with ""High Detail"" mode on, but it was made a little while ago.Overall, I'd say it's a fun game but don't buy it for the full price. I recieved this for free from a friend, and I wasn't dissapointed but it was a slightly different experience than what I remember on the PS2 version.6/10 ",36,3,0,4,5,1,1

												This game could have been so amazing but its not. There are parts of this game that are impossible to do with a mouse and keyboard. You're stuck unless you have a controller which i know many people have but i dont like that you HAVE to use one just to get past certain parts in the game. The boss fights are frustrating and repetitive basically lightning, attack, run, repeat till they're dead. I wanted to love this game and did until near the end where you will be stuck just as many others have been. It too bad they care more for quick money than putting in the time to make a good PC port.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Writing here on 05 Dec 2015.Everything is wrong with this game, avoid it. Spoend your time and money on a cheap excellent indie game like Invisible Inc. Don;t waste your time on this game, go play something else.* Combat is repetitive, just hack and slash. * No skill required in combat.* No story, * No character progression.* No loot to collect.* No weapons dropped by enemies.* No weapon pickups.* No loot in destroud boxes or objects.* Linear path, just follow the dot, no alternative routes.* Console port with no PC specific additions. Framerate loecked at 30 frmaes per second (fps) is a disgrace to PC gamers.* No tradeables with other NPCs.* Pre-rendered video, Full motion video cut-scenes.* Bland levels with lots of brown, dark brown and dark colors. * Repetitive scenery.*(Enemy) difficulty increases by increasing the number of enemies.* Enemies rush up to you and all you have to do is cut  'em down.* No skill based combat. If your upgrade for 'skill points' was not right you'll take much longer to defeat an enemy, whereas with a game for example Metal Gear Revengeance one could defeat an enemy on skill.* It is totally possible to speed run through whole sections/levels, avoiding combat.* Gfx is horrible console ported, even for 2008 standard. A digrace to PC gamers.* Plays like an arcade coin-up game, but the endless version. * DirectX9 game not compatible with my LG 3D displays. * Horrible framerate, only 30 fps. According to Steam forumsa this was how the game was designed to run, framerate locked.* Played with a wireless XBOX360 controller on PC.Don't waste your time on this, go play something else. I have invested a lot of my precious time in this game. I knew I shoul've played Invisble Inc, or Endless Legend or  Withcher 3 instead... but now I'm this far I might as well finish this.

												Force Unleashed?  No.     Force mildly unrestrained, YesPoor to decent game with average force powers.  If your looking for a Jedi game play Jedi Knight: Jedi Outcast.  It is actually a better game in almost everyway for being 6 years older.  Force Unkempt does have better graphis and some really nice cut scenes.  The bounes levels are more entertaining then the campaign.  They give a fun ""what if"" vibe to the story you know and love.  However Jedi OPutcast has better controls, more and stronger force powers, multiplayer, genuine plot, and a satisfyingly long campaign.  Also all of the mini and big boss battles are not quick time events so you get a sense of accomplishment for actually beating them, not just playing a game of simon.  Was hoping Force Unleashed II would be better but still have not got it to run correctly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is disappointing. I played this game on the PS3 and Wii. If you have a console, buy it on the console (even on the Wii it's a lot more fun). This is a terrible port to the PC and I'm very very disappointed. Cons:-Locked on 30fps-Loading screen for everything-Loading takes a long time-Only singleplayer (on console there was a fighting mode)-Feels choppy due to the frame limit-Shift + TAB Steam overlay glitches during cutscenes-Very boring when playing with Keyboard and Mouse-Repetitive-Awkward Camera position during boss fights-Background graphics look like crap-Why can't i play as Juno Eclipse?Pros (as experienced from this PC version only)-Not so awful visuals for a third person game-Decent physics-Good storyline-Good character development and amount of characters-Cheat codes-A lot of costumes-A lot of force combos-Many different map design and you go on a lot of different planetsOverall this game is not so great on the PC. You can play with a controller, but still, you're playing with 30 fps so why not play this on console instead. Besides, you can go to gamestop, get a $5 pre-owned Force Unleashed instead. If you don't own a console and you want this game, just don't get it at full price. I got mine for $6.60 instead of $20. If you think youre computer can't even play this game above 25 fps, then I guess it's ok. But I built a gaming PC just so I can play a crap port on 30 fps.			",323,43,11,26,28,1,26

 Star Wars The Bugs Unleashed: Ultimate♥♥♥♥♥♥EditionAs many others, I got this game with the recent humble bundle. If you are one of the unlucky ones who got it prior and payed more than 5 bucks you pretty much got ripped off.At first I was really looking forward to playing this load of crap game, as I am kind of a Star Wars fan. But already after the first hour into playing this, I already got extremely frustrated. Apart from several bugs concerning  the audio , which sometimes cuts out the music and some of the SFX during a mission and never comes back again ever, even after restarting the game and on several occasions happening  the cutscenes , as the game randomly crashes to desktiop after some and last but not least  the ragdoll system , which had me glitch out of bounds on two occasions, when a Purge Trooper grabbed me and slammed me not into, but through the ground below the world, where I was stuck, forcing me to quit and reload the save, because there is no ""restart from last checkpoint""-optionthis game features some ♥♥♥♥ing infuriating gameplay-designchoices:There are absolutely no invincibility frames. None. Meaning, when you get hit by an enemy attack, which leaves you stunned for a solid second, you will get hit again by another enemy within this peroid,without you being able to defend yourself at all. If you're unlucky, you will be combo'ed to death several times when you face more than one or two enemies at once.Many attacks by the bigger enemies you will encounter, like Rancors, are unblockable. They mostly cannot be interrupted and are really nearly impossible to avoid when you go at them with your lightsaber, leaving you often times with cheesing the fights and abusing the poor AI to get them stuck on terrain and Force-Lightning the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them over and over again, as your only option to carry on with your sanity intact. All of the boss battles feel really unpolished and imbalanced. There is little feedback on how strong your opponent really is and especially on the later bossfights, you will be twoshot by an unblockable counterattack. Not to mention the incredibly stupid ""bossfight"" against the  Stardestroyer which you have to pull down from orbit singlehandedly with the force  in a ridiculous minigame in which you have arrange the analog sticks as shown on screen. Not only is this as silly as it sounds, they also give you the wrong directions, so you have to try around for at least 30 minutes to find the right spot to finish this♥♥♥♥♥♥off.Needless to say that these design flaws don't add to the enjoyment you will get out of this game, as it just feels clunky, unfinished, unresponsive and poorly playtested (if at all).Furthermore we have another great example of a crappy PC port. There are basically no graphic options and the game is locked at 30fps, it does feature mouse and keyboard control, but you have to edit the keys in a seperate launcher.The only reason I finished this, was my interest in the  story, although it wasn't particulary well written and the hope, that I will get some sort of satisfaction out of it, without having thrown away 10+ hours of my life.TL;DR: Crappy port, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of aggravating bugs, infuriating combat mechanics, okay-ish story with flat characters. 2/10 would not play again.

												*Review note, I have played through the entire game on Xbox 360. This is about the PC version*Subpar graphics, awful video options menu (Brightness, contrast and Gamma), you'd expect a developer with at least ten to fifteen years experience on the PC would make a better PC version. It feels like it was developed by howler monkeys, with no hands and typewriters.Also: pressing start to skip a cutscene minimises the game and returns to your Desktop and upon opening causes a multitude of bugs including text crawls being buggy as-well as varying audio and graphical glitches.  In light Force Unleased as a game it's OK. Nothing really special, has a nice physics engine. (Which Lucasarts spent heavy time marketing it)  but aside from that. Character animations are meh, animations are stiff and robotic, etc,etc.I do like the extra content such as the added campaigns though.However, as a PC gamer. I can't recommend this ever. It's one for if you own a console.			",309,30,1,32,20,2,39

												Worst SW game ever... Beautiful graphics, nice physics, all for frustrating arcade game. Dozens of combos, but in fight you use only one, over and over again. Boss fight = same combo, use few more times.Famous ""bring down the destroyer"" part - the most frustrating and repeatable fight ever... wave after wave of TIEs (each destroyed the same way) and between them player has to try to force destroyer to point at given pixel on screen. Because force allows to pull down objects only if they're aligned properly. Feng shui probably.And don't let me get started on so called story and characters.PC port sucks like hell - who would thought about using [] as arrows to navigate menu?Damn, I stop it right here, it's not worth my time to describe it further... If you liked JK series and you think Force Unleashed is some sort of continuation, think again. Then look at its abbreviation.			",117,64,0,16,9,0,19

												As a Star Wars fans,I feel terrible to write a not-recommend review for this one. Yes, Hack & Slash were hype back in 2009, but this one didn't deliver what people wants from Star Wars.I mean, c'mon man, Do you know what people love from Star Wars? It's the story, and this one is crap due to that.The story so linear and following a scripted line even Dynasty Warrior have better story than this.And please, don't let me mention about the bad port to PC. It's really a disgrace for us, PC gamers.capped at 30 fps, ♥♥♥♥ing 30gigs in size but jagged texture and bad character models. Compared to the game released that year;take a peek on Prototype; It's just a letdown..No, buy this at your console PS3 or Wii, or don't buy it at all, you'll not regret it tho.6/10 SWTFU : Loading Simulator.edit (after finishing the whole story)- It's still a no, but not a big no, it's just.. the story is great but it's so so compared even to SW animation series. It's like there's a big hole in the story.. if you finished you'll be getting what I mean, if you're not bored to death beforehand.- The idea of ""finishing blow"" is good, but it's just become a standar QTE because it's so repetitive and have a little variation. And for the big boss it's just a single variation for finishing blow.- We like lightsabers, we love to have all colorful gems and crystal in it. but.. can we have another type instead the standart like the one in the movie ep 4-6...hey but, if I can use a short-bladed lightsaber, or a longer one lightsaber, or! the one like a police baton just like one of the boss in game. I would be so happy.TL;DR9 hours to complete, if you think you have a 9hours spare lifetime to see a so so story of Star Wars, you can give it a shot.			",217,34,16,37,17,0,27

The camera keeps moving around, maybe attempting to give you a cinematic feel but it just messes up the fight more than anything. When you use a power during a boss fight, you just have to HOPE that you are pointed in the right direction to hit them. Also, no block button, what a brilliant design....4/10 Would NOT reccomend			",210,15,2,24,18,0,27

A game that split a gaming fanbase.Now I played the game on ym 360 and it wasnt that good then and it's even worse now.Graphics look dated to all hell and are in no way pleasing to the eye(I love Jedi Academy and it's a game from before 2000 so stfu). Rating = 4/10Story is ok but I can't remember much, though, I didn't like it. The game is...ok if you are a big star wars fan.Rating = 6/10Gameplay is a chore, it just consists of you mashing the attack button over and over while using the force push most of the time. Rating = 5/10Main Problem is that it feels like a chore and has HORRID OPTIMISATION! I have a PC that can run MAD MAX AT 60FPS WITH NO PROBLEM BUT I CAN'T EVEN GET 20 ON THIS! This is a really bad port, just get the console version if you really want the game!My Final Thought = 5/10, stay away unless you're a huge star wars fan. If you want a good jedi game I TRULY recommend Jedi Academy! ",260,28,3,27,33,3,21

												Star Wars always needed a hack and slash game. Force Unleashed was the game we needed, and deserved, after a 5 year hiatus from Jedi Knight. Ignoring, of course, that it has no multiplayer. That's probably a good thing, though, considering how wonky and broken saber duels were in JK2 and 3.Sam Witwer, the dude who voiced Darth Maul in Clone Wars and also Rebels, and also Crashdown from Battlestar Galactica 2003 (and unfortunately the protagonist in the upcoming PS4 zombie game), plays Galen Marek i.e Starkiller, Vader's secret apprentice. He finds Marek in the beginning of the game and raises him as his own, then uses him to apparently infiltrate/create the rebel alliance. TFU is kind of a Sith power fantasy where you go around beating the hell out of Jedi masters, falling in love with an imperial officer, and pulling Star Destroyers out of the atmosphere with your force powers. But it's awesome.The combat in this game is unfortunately not as complex, or at least the moveset not as large as you would hope for after gems like Ninja Gaiden or games like God of War. You get your standard Force powers - crush, push, pull, mind trick, lightning, and you get to develop those skills by putting points in to them by earning points and by finding Holocrons, which also lets you make some sort-of-combos. You also find saber crystals throughout the game which change your saber color and change what passive effect the saber has when used. Combat eventually gets boring as with all games that have combat, but on the bright side you get to toss Stormtroopers around like toys, or kill those walking trash can droids. Graphics, considering they are from 2008, are as good as you can expect from a console game that's 8 years old at this point. The PC port doesn't appear to have been given any special attention, though - even maxing out the graphics still shows that they used the same low-res textures for most of the game.Unfortunately, as a GFWL game, this is one of many titles that didn't get the Steamworks treatment and never will. No achievements,  no workshop, none of that. It also has a fair share of technical problems and I can't even get mine to work on Windows 10 properly, not to mention it would crash at random on Windows 7 when it had nothing to do with performance.I'm sure it's overpriced right now, so I really wouldn't recommend buying it if it's anywhere over $10.

												This is everything that is wrong with console games infecting PC games. Horrible camera angle boss battles, unblockable random damage, horrible random jumping and falling, getting locked into weird animations. And lots of press X to not die quicktime events. On top of it, it promises to unleash the force but controlling where you throw things is nearly impossible, so you're mostly just randomly tossing things around. Garbage for caffeine tweaking 12 year olds.			",99,8,1,16,4,0,12

												Frustratingly clunky, slow and clumsy mechanics and controls make you feel like you're controlling an autistic child with a toy lightsaber rather than the apprentice of one of the most badass siths in the Star Wars universe. Enemy types usually progress as follows: 1. Run-of-the-mill goon 2. Guy that strengthens run-of-the-mill goons 3. Bigger, more powerful run-of-the-mill goon with different colour scheme 4. A whole group of these bigger, more powerful run-of-the-mill goons that effectively jump on you and take turn ♥♥♥♥ing you in the♥♥♥♥♥until you die. What makes it worse is that this all-powerful sith apprentice you play as takes 10 minutes to get up after being knocked down, so when swarmed by these big groups of enemies you'll often have no chance to actually fight back. You don't actually feel like you have control of what's going on due to the bad controls and horrible game design.The only things good about this game are the lore, the character design, and some of the locales.Avoid this game if you can, you'll just end up bashing your keyboard or controller into oblivion.

												The Force Unleashed is a game where you take... hold, on, let me start over, I've already ♥♥♥♥ed this up and called it a game. The Force Unleashed is a franchise-themed BDSM simulator where you play the part of a hapless consumer who pays a monolithic giant to hold you down against the floor and violate you repeatedly.The Force Unleashed is a great example of what happens when none of the developers communicate in any way. First you have the nerdy tech people like myself who start drooling in their trousers when they think of all of the things you could do with a physics-heavy engine designed around the use of Force powers. They brought ground-breaking technology like Digital Molecular Matter, which allows materials like metal or wood to deform or shatter in dynamic, realistic ways when you do something like Force-push them or slam a stormtrooper into them, or Euphoria, an AI engine which allows those stormtroopers to reach out and grab on to nearby objects in a vain attempt to stop you from flinging them around like a screaming hackey-sack. Unfortunately, the tech people never communicated with the rest of the team, so their fancy tech doesn't really get used at all and the engine is essentially wasted. The tech people also didn't communicate with REALITY, and actually told the general public that the game would only be released on consoles because PCs weren't powerful enough to handle their physics engine. Somehow this didn't stop them from releasing the game on the Wii.Next are the level designers, who were busy constructing their linear set pieces. Apparently they were too caught up trying to make outdoor environments feel like narrow hallways to speak with the tech team, and didn't even find out about the fancy Digital Molecular Matter system until just before release, the result being that there is about one conspicuously-placed object that actually uses the system in each level. We can also see that the level designers didn't actually watch the films, because in The Force Unleashed the Death Star consists entirely of an interlocking grid of gigantic hangar bays.The gameplay designers were apparently never told that they were working on a Star Wars property at all, and so they worked from the offset under the model that every enemy should have exactly one weakness, and that each enemy should have a different weakness, apparently not knowing that your character is always holding a ♥♥♥♥ING LIGHTSABER.Let's look at this lightsaber issue further. One of the core game design problems faced by every team designing a Star Wars game that includes lightsabers is that the lightsaber quite obviously should be a one-hit kill weapon, but unlimited-use one-hit kill weapons don't usually make for the best game design. Therefore, the designers always have to find some way not to let lightsabers effortlessly carve through all opposition, either by encouraging ranged combat or by limiting the damage of lightsabers for gameplay purposes. TFU, however, is set between the three Star Wars films and George Lucas's parody prequels; we see claerly in the films that no one has lightsaber-proof armor. In TFU, every later enemy has a sword or shield or armor that is completely 100% lightsaber-proof. In TFU the only difference between a lightsaber and a pointy stick is that a stick doesn't require batteries. Well, I suppose there is also the fact that a lightsaber never gets dull; I wish I could say the same of the gameplay.It's ironic that in a game where it seems that 100% of the effort went into graphics and gameplay, the gameplay is really quite terrible. As previously mentioned, the lightsaber is really quite useless and you are only able to kill enemies with Force powers. While this doesn't sound bad on paper, in reality each enemy is only weak to exactly one thing, and so for the most part combat alternates between guessing which power is going to kill a new type of enemy, and long sections of fighting that same type of enemy over and over and over in the same exact way. Wait a minute, I thought this game was supposed to encourage creativity? The only enemies you are given true freedom against are the hapless standard stormtroopers, who fart their blasters ineffectually at you until you go barelling through them or pick them up with Force grip and bash them around a bit. Since the basic stormtrooper is the only opportunity you have to really have fun with grip and push, they are actually given quite a lot of durability, so you can sadistically bash them back and forth between two walls like a future serial killer swinging a squirrel between two trees by the tail. This is fun at first, but if you aren't actually a future serial killer, after a while you actually start to feel bad for the poor stormtrooper who was just doing his job until you decided to smack him around like an unwanted baby at a post-delivery abortion clinic.Of course, making you scream in rage at all of the enemies who are immune to ♥♥♥♥ING LIGHTSABERS wasn't sufficiently sadistic for these developers. As the game goes on, you start running into more and more enemies whose primary weapon is a homing blast that knocks you over, and whose rate of fire is exactly equal to the amount of time it takes you to stand back up. By the Death Star, when you are fighting gigantic killer robots and stormtroopers with cloaking devices who all somehow disappeared from the Empire's arsenal before A New Hope, you will be facing thirty enemies at once who all have a homing missile that knocks you down for exactly the length of time it takes to fire another homing missile, and you'll start to feel like the cheerleader who told the entire football team to have their way with her at once. The game turns into a screaming ragefest of dodging around endless hanger bays killing a single stormtrooper every thirty seconds when you happen to have the luck to land directly behind him between jumps, until by the end of the nightmarish ordeal you are a heavy drinker and need 5 years of therapy.If you aren't convinced that the ""game"" design is balanced around sado-masochism, consider this: if you die, you retain any experience and abilities that you gained before you died, despite being taken to the last checkpoint. The game is actually designed so you can grind through the torturous end sequences by dying over and over.When the developers realized that gaming PCs are in fact much more powerful than an XBox 360, they released a 30-gigabyte version of TFU for Windows. If you happen to like to customize your games and are fool enough to change any of your keyboard controls, you will be enraged at the boss-fights (which consist entirely of quick-time button sequences like some strange combat-themed DDR) because the keys they tell you to press on-screen are the original keys, not whatever you rebound your controls to. Maybe the screen is telling you to press WQAD and you actually have to press EWSF. I emailed the company about this and they actually told me the onscreen controls were all hardcoded and to consider using the default controls. Well, you gigantic♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you didn't actually want me to be able to change my controls, you could have done the sensible thing and not let me change my ♥♥♥♥ing controls. Instead, each boss fight for me became a repetetive pattern of reaching a quick-time button sequence, writing down what keys it said to press, translating those keys to my actual controls, memorizing what I really needed to press, and then beating that sequence and making it to the next sequence to start all over again. Wait a minute, does that sound familiar? Now I'm just studying for a test. If I wanted to study for a ♥♥♥♥ing test, I'd be at school instead of trying to squeeze two seconds of fun out of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ video game.The only saving grace for The Force Unleashed is that it is only a few hours long and thus won't waste as much of your life as the prequels did			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TLDR: glitches make you get stuck in the floor and environment, forcing a game restart, force powers are often unresponsive, camera is erratic, combat is frustratingly bad, constant knock downs that use ragdoll physics to keep you down for a long time, and poorly implemented boss fights, some of the worst I have ever seen. These are just a few of this games problems that bury it far into the dirt.One of the worst games there is on steam and one of the worst games I have ever played period. The only reason to bother with it is for the story and with the cutscenes being available on youtube there is no reason to buy this terrible game. Bad gameplay aside, I wasn't able to finish it because of its numerous technical issues. On the last level you fight 4 waves of elite soldiers. 1 wave would have been plenty, but for some reason at this point they decide to flood you with them. It is one of the worst stages I have ever seen in any game because as soon as it starts you get knocked down over and over again. Most of the time there is no way to even dodge it because there are about 4 different types of enemies firing at you from all heights and angles that all have knock down shots so you stay on your back most of the time. You can't stop and fight because the second you do you go into a knock down loop and are lucky to get out of it. The knockdown in this game is particularly bad because it takes its time letting the ragdoll physics take over and ragdoll you around on the floor until your guy does a Shawn Michaels hand-spring back to his feet which is also very slow.So since I couldn't do this part without dying from staying on knock down lock down, I lowered the difficulty to easy so I could take less dmg and just get the game over with. Since about half way through the game I had started to rush and just try to get this mess over with. I lost any urge I had to keep looking for skill point cubes and just went into hurry mode long before even the last level. So with the bad guys gone on this level, you have to use force pull and open some grates to jump down into a lower area. The problem here, like many other parts in the game, is that the force powers don't always respond right. So I couldn't open the grates and started jumping around. I got completely glitch stuck in a part of the floor that was raised a little and had to exit to the main menu and select continue game. It started me back at the beginning of the level so i would have had to defeat those 4 waves again. I just alt+f4'ed right the ♥♥♥♥ out and uninstalled this immediately. It wasn't the first time I had gotten stuck in the game in a place where I should'nt be able to but did because their quality testing on this game was non-existent. This was just the final straw.About 3/4 through the game the sound also started messing up. I came out of a cutscene and only half of the sound effects were working. I restarted the game and it fixed it but on the next level it started it again so I just played until the last level like that because at this point the game was just so bad that I didn't care.The boss fights are also some of the worst boss fights I have ever seen. This is I assume supposed to be a casual game for any and all Star Wars fans but the only ones who are going to be able to beat most of the bosses are people with a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of skill and patience. Any casual gamer or kid playing this has no chance of beating most bosses unless maybe they put it on easy. The boss fights were poorly conceived and even more poorly implemented.I could go on, but this game isn't worth another thought. I recently bought both games on sale for $6 each and this was a complete waste of money. I am just hoping that Force Unleashed 2 is better than this awful waste of time and money.0/10 because of game breaking glitches, sickeningly bad boss fights, and overall poor gameplay in every area.

Force Unleased ReviewMy hours logged for this game are not accurate. I played the game offline while I was on vacation. I originally played it on the PS2.OverviewThe game itself is a fairly solid and fun game... with a little bit of repetition in the gameplay and levels... you can expect to see most of the enemies you will encounter within a couple levels and encounter various types of them throughout the game as it escalates. The PC release of the game has some issues... some that specifically I will go further into detail later in this review.StoryThe story is the best part of the game. If you can deal with all of the PC issues of this port and you are a Star Wars fan then the story is definitely one worth getting through. You play as a secret apprentice to Darth Vader and it has some nice tie ins to the original movies... It takes place inbetween episodes 3 and 4 respectively. This edition also contains several other add ons to the original and while fun and some cool levels they felt tacked on to the story and unessential.GameplayThe gameplay is pretty fun and from the first level (which I will not spoil for you but has a very cool playable character) where you really see what kind of power you will harness in the game to the later levels where you are a finely tuned killing machine is fast and rewarding. I played through on the hardest difficulty setting which I would not recommend... It is not well balanced and some parts are almost entirely reliant on luck... although playing on the normal difficult level after felt like a breeze in comparison. This is a game that you are supposed to feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥and it really keeps upping the ante with the abilities you gain access to in an RPG style of progression that rewards you for exploring and playing well.Graphics and AudioThe graphics while dated are not terrible but are plagued with some issues I will go into detail. Overall the cutscenes are pretty good though. Like I said previously there are some audio and visual glitches in the game when it was ported. The audio cuts out partially in the last two levels (and also in earlier levels for some dialogue in my experience). These nearly ruined the experience for me as it was very removing from the game which at first I was really enjoying and I got caught up in trying to remedy this. There is a slight patch someone made (unnofficial) on the steam forums but it may or may not work correctly. I still experienced some slight problems and was never able to repair some visual glitch that happens almost every time I use force push (which is fairly often) Also occasionally I would find my character caught on invisible objects or have enemies spawn in randomly out of nowhere due to me clipping into an area where I was not supposed to be for a battle and I am unable to view the enemies nor navigate to them to kill them and thus wind up being killed by blaster fire from an invisible enemy. ConclusionI cannot recommend the PC version of the game to anyone who can get the console version. The Devs have all but abandoned this at this point and there is no hope of the problems that are hurting this otherwise decent game of being fixed at any point. While it is a fun game and I enjoyed playing it there are many better games out there today. If you are a big fan of Star Wars than by all means pick it up but do so  with caution and you may want to consider waiting until it goes on sale.			",370,86,1,28,26,4,30

												I've not recommended this due to the completion time and lack of replay-ability.You play as a Sith Apprentice, you have access to different force powers and, of course, you duel wield lightsabres.The combat is okay, you can deflect bullets back at enemies, jump really high and other cool stuff. However I found the game to be far too easy and incredibly short, about 4 or 5 hours long without even trying to speed through the content.It's worth playing, but I would suggest to pick it up during the sale as more of a 'filler' game.I'd give this game a Han Shot First out of 10.

												The visual quality is downright garbage, the game is almost impossible to play at points, because of the background blurring into the rest of the screen making it a literal mess. A tie fighter crossed my screen and left a dozen ghost images across my screen that only disappeared when i went indoors. When I cam back outdoors another tie fighter flew by and same issue. This game is great on any other platform. I don't recommend buying this for your computer.			",35,4,0,15,4,0,7

												I bought a star wars bundle of 4 games.  All have been pretty disapointing. This one has goregous graphics at least, but I'm totally confused.  First Xbox joystock (Mac) doesn't work at all.  Next the game started and I'm Darth Vader walking a path - killing wookies.  Simple - boring.  Next I'm seeing a view in a flying ship, and seeing imperial walkers.  going in a cave. And it appears on on the good side?   (Wasn't I just Darth Vader) ?   no storyline? no continuity?  The graphics will bring me back a 2nd time - but really disapointed in the 4 games in the bundle.  Hoping to find more depth in at least this one. I can't recommend it yet.   Even though this looks the best out of the 4 star wars games in the bundle. (20 bucks)			",197,38,12,5,37,3,2

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately"". Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through"" I agreed. At 20, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel an overwelming sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway...			",194,26,3,22,21,1,48

												Force powers, although initially they feel good, just end up being too clumsy to wield due to bad targetting where it's difficult to target what to pick up/push and where you want it to get thrown to. Light saber combat is lackluster, especially compared to the Jedi Knight series. Would recommend Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy instead for a Star Wars Jedi fix.			",185,17,2,25,9,0,18

												It's pretty, given that it's getting on in years.  And the story seems like it has potential.But that control system.  Yikes.  Both on a controller and via keyboard and mouse, this is barely playable.  The boss fights are tedious and every now and again you'll get locked in a confined space with a huge creature  that requries very specific and precise actions. Which you will fail to pull off because of that control system.Avoid this one.			",75,28,0,9,18,3,19

												This game has everything a good hack and slash game should have, exept production quality.I'd recommend this game for Star Wars fans, but everyone else can skip it. It has great potential, but the game is simply very bad quality: bad graphics, bad irresponsive controls, horrible movement which kills platformer fun (sometimes your character simply does not want to go straight even when there's no obstacles), stupid AI, opponents who doesn't respond to your hits and break your combos like you're some kind of puppet not a powerful unstoppable Starkiller. The gameplay is fun, game has good story, lore, lots of playable charatcers from Star Wars Saga etc..., but the quality of the game kills it completely.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I realize this game is kind of old now but I really have to say, THIS IS A HORRIBLE GAME! The lack of control while in combat is atrocious. I can't aim and even when surrounded by enemies, frequently attacks will ""miss"" even if force attacks like lightning are literally surrounding them. Since you aren't totally in control of aiming, targeting objects and enemies can be rather ineffective and ruins the whole purpose of having awesome force powers. There is a loading screen every time you view an option or abilities screen, and when you go back even if you aren't changing anything. Also if you are in the middle of an attack or if your enemy in attacking you or you are getting up from being knocked down and also sometimes while in the air, control is taken from you and you can't move or attack. This leaves you open to getting killed quickly even from full health in a few seconds. Example: You get knocked down and as you get up, you can't move, before control is given back to you allowing you to dodge, you are knocked down again, and again until you are dead and you have no chance to move or defend yourself, and if you do, the attack might miss or go through your enemy anyways and you get knocked down. I don't even feel like I am even playing most of the time. And the there are the issues of poorly programed platforms you are supposed to stand on and the game decides your character can't stand on the bridge you need to use to go forwards and you slide of to your death making you have to do the whole area again. This is such an insanely awful game. The story isn't even all that great, in my opinion, either and I love Star Wars. The second game was much better, I finished that one. The story still kinda sucked though and some of the voice acting is not that great, especially general kota. It will sound like he is asking a question when making a statement. I am glad this came in a bundle of other games I much enjoy or I would be upset I paid for this.			",361,88,26,42,20,0,21

												Easily among the Worst Games I Have Ever Played. Yes, I meant to capitalize that. It's not a terrible game in the sense that some old beat 'em up you like is a terrible game, but it's fun in a mindless, nostalgic kind of a way. No. This is just a HORRIBLE game. The opening crawl is unskippable, a flashing silhouette of the game's unspeakably charmless protagonist reminding you to be patient as you watch a three-sentence lead-in fade into nothingness. But your journey is only beginning, young padawan. You'll then take control of Lord Vader, arriving on Chewbacca's homeworld of Kashyyk to kill a ""Rogue Jedi,"" whatever the frig that is. Vader stalks through the forest planet at an absolutely mercilessly slow trudge (no, you can't sprint), blasting force pushes that knock down literally everything into terrible, splintering masses of pre-realist-destruction, or slashing through the exact same model of Wookie (Wookiee? Wooky? Am I even a person anymore?), over and over again, until your eyes melt out of your head and chastize you for using them in such an unclean manner. And I won't lie - there's something that gets very ""No Russian""-y about mowing down innocent creatures that have literally no chance of stopping you, made all the more surreally disturbing by the fact that it's the same model, making the same dying animal sound effects. When you reach your quarry - a miserable, scrunched-up octogenarian spouting off ""the force has corrupted your mind"" cliches like they're going out of frigging fashion - the ""boss fight"" is literally just force throwing him at absolutely ludicrious distances and velocities, then waiting a few seconds until the old turd dusts himself off so you can do it again. Rinse and repeat several hundred times until you've knocked his health bar to a squinch and you get a prize! Nope, not a gun materializing from your screen and blowing your brains out for being so dreadfully stupid as to sit through that, but A QUICKTIME EVENT! Once you've ""Pressed E to Run the Old♥♥♥♥♥♥Through,"" you stumble across the last thing you expected to find in Star Wars: a young innocent that Darth Vader senses that the Force is strong in! How the 80-year-old man you just piledrived through Kashyyk City Hall sired a child on an alien planet with no females in sight is beyond me, but then again, so is how dozens of people got paid to make this steaming pile of what I can only assume are the liposuctioned remnants of George Lucas' neck fat. A few dreary cutscenes later and you get some semblance of a tutorial, narrated by a robot assistant that, by its own cheery admission, is programmed to kill you (no follow up to the threat of death by the droid, incidentally). After another mercifully brief and utterly confusing cutscene where you're introduced in earnest to Vader's moody protege-and-I-guess-step-son, ""Starkiller,"" his spaceship's pilot, ""Hot Australian Girl,"" and a rebel commander-or-maybe-Jedi-or-who-cares, you arrive on a bigger spaceship to - not even joking - kill a rogue Jedi. How rogue he has gone, I don't know, because when you show up there, everybody is shooting everybody, including you. Yes, Stormtroopers and ""Militia"" alike, further clouding the murky narrative you just spent between $3 and $50 on. But hey! At least you're in control of the protagonist, and more importantly, you can run (even if it is actually just a dash move that you have to keep jabbing at the key for until your finger considers launching an armed insurrection). And run you shall - through the boring, console-optimized landscape of low-poly environments and splotchy textures and the same three models of enemies. Fortunately, there are loading icons every few yards to punctuate the inanity of your experience and remind you you're not actually stuck in a time loop, flickering in and out almost imperceptibly as a horribly engineered game tries to cope with the fact that a system might be able to accommodate more than a few hundred linear feet of lifeless, repetitive environments. Combat is awful - take everything you've grown to love about titles like ""Arkham Asylum"" and then forget it. This game drinks the tears of games with good combat, lavishing in them like a Thomas Harris serial killer and dancing nude to an 80s synth pop song while you huddle, terrified and apalled in the corner, rocking back and forth wondering what went wrong that lead you to this point. ""I should've listened to my parents,"" you'll think as you press the slash key to slash, over and over again. Get bored of slashing and want to run ahead? Nope, the genius developers have thought of that with an old trick from 1993 called ""invisible walls."" You can also force-throw things in an attempt to break up the monotony, but whatever eye♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥they hired to design these environments apparently snorted so much meth that they made literally everything throwable, so more often then not you're throwing one of the forty-six throwable objects on screen you DIDN'T mean to throw. Oh, and the selection is camera-agnostic - meaning that you'll have to align your character's bearing, not the camera's, to select the thing. But all of this has a silver lining - I got so fed up of looking for whatever object I was supposed to force-throw to complete a *cough* ""puzzle"" that I ended up quitting the game, uninstalling it, and vowing to really rethink my life choices. Which I will get to just as soon as I wrap my head around how an army of infuriated nerds hasn't found Haden Blackman and bludgeoned him to death with their limited edition copies of this game.

												When first buy game, it seem good. Good graphic, sound, I much like. Then I play. It leave bad taste in mouth like bratwurst. Very bad. I pay good money for game, I expect it work! Overall, it remind me of story. I was 12, very young Russian child. My mother tell, ""you grow up, become like Brezhnev. Be big, strong, not little."". I grow to be like Brezhnev. Then, I force to be left country. I see president, I think he little man. I go to bet dogs, but it illegal. I go prison. I get out, bet on chicken fight. Chicken I bet on lose. In end, don't lose if lose is bad. I give game 2/17.			",356,149,14,86,67,10,78

												The game isn't bad, it is playable. Although don't spend too much on this particular title or you will feel hard done by. The first mission feels like a sample of a better game and the rest of the game feels rushed and falls short. If you do end up playing this game - I wish you luck against the starship which is one of the worst scripped missions in a modern game I have played in a while.The force powers are a lot of fun, throwing the enemies over the edge of the map or into objects - even electricuting them. However with this said the missions are short, arguably very easy (having completed the campaign under 6 hours on normal). There is no consistency in boss battles, some are fun, some are just a mindless grind.I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game - get it cheap/free.			",215,26,4,28,26,1,34

												I really liked this game. I love almost everything Star Wars and this game fueled my obsession. You can change lightsaber colors and change if it has healing, lightning, draining abilities, and more. You can also level up your powers to be stronger. After the game ends you can play alternate ending stories which were great. The graphics are nice, but keep in mind if you have a Nvidia graphics card you may have to change the settings. My game started with everything being blurry when you move the camera. It's overall an easy fix though. 5 minutes on Google helped me to correct the problem.			",92,34,1,31,12,0,9

The ps2 version had a way better lvling system by using points, the levels were way more fun. What happend to the robot scrap yard??? robot knights? what the hell happend to those scavaging robots crawling out of between the junk and had robot like arms. The enormus titan bots that would crush you. The movement sucks too. I realy loved this game on my ps2. Still that doesnt make this a bad game.Iam just confused, why is this so differend?

												A great game. Force Unleashed takes place between episodes III and IV, following Vader's secret apprentice, ""Starkiller.""Having played this game on the PSP, I was dissapointed by the console version. The PS3/360 version of the game had many parts cut out, severly shortening the game. So far as I can tell, the content in the PC and PSP versions is roughly the same.The only issue I have encountered so far is distant objects and the environmental backdrop. Distant object simply do not appear, making it difficult to prepare for large fights or see where you're going. The environmental backdrop looks like a shmere of color, fanning out in a strange pattern any time something passes- such as a star fighter or debris falling from the sky. While this issues cause some minor difficulty, the game still runs perfectly fine, meaning only some of the visuals are effected.Bonus campaigns, skins, abilities, and lightsabers are also available. Even with the visually unappealing graphics bugs, this game is still worth a play!Edit: This game just lost some major points with me because 1) there are still parts of the game missing- the PSP version has much more content- and 2) the Star Destroyer scene- everyone who has played knows how *****ing impossible that can seem- is pretty much unbeatable if you have the same graphics glitch I do. I litterally cannot see the Tie fighters as they fly in, and the Star Destroyer is marked only by three large glowing exhauses from its engines. Now, in the PSP version I can pull this thing down in no time because I CAN SEE IT. Here, I have no clue what the angle of the ship is, so I can't make the proper adjustments, and we all know who faulty the on-screen button display is.8.5/10 for PSP6/10 for PC because of graphics issues			",131,15,0,17,8,2,19

												Bad PC port. It's pretty fun to massacre everything with the force, but it's pretty unwieldy and hard to control. Enemies don't always fly where you want to throw them, and certain enemies will occasionally trap you in a repeated attack and take off way more health than they should.Also, the star destroyer ""boss"" is bad enough to ruin anything positive going on. It's a boring fight with confusing, outright incorrect on-screen prompts that becomes almost impossible with a mouse.			",193,80,1,32,13,2,10

												Hmm. Well now this is a tricky one. On the one hand, the combat is refreshing and well played but its also annoying, and if you press the wrong button you can't cancel it. The enemies are interesting and well placed and paced, but their attacks are not so. Sith Master difficulty especially, purge troopers, jumprtoopers and the snipers will just mess you up. Bosses... Bosses are varied, Kazdan Paratus easily being the most difficult of the game, if you include DLC then it's probably Luke SKywalker. Shaak Ti is ridiculously easy. Also the story - praised, and rightly so. Gets a bit broing as you cant skip most cutscenes, which can be annoying, but otherwise well-executed, well made and very interesting crated as the bridge between 3 and 4. In conclusion, despite some MASSIVE graphical errors and sound desyncing, some annoying and frustrating moments and overall shoddy block system... I suggest you get this gameCOMPLETONISTS NOTE: how much do you like stress? completing this game 100% on sith master hurts a lot, but explot the ai a little and have good twitch refleexes and you should be fine :)			",613,188,16,79,74,5,121

												This game is a good example of a Force user that has no restraint wich is a real spectacle to behold and a lot of fun to be had,but the game does has it's issues while lifting an enemy up imapleing him with your lightsaber shocking him with lighting and then force pushing him into his friends to exploed is very entertaining the game has been poorly ported to the PC platform locked at 30 Fps and there is a small complaint the cloth physics are turned off these two  can be fixed by visiting the PC gaming wiki which will help you make the game more enjoyabel the other little complaint would be the weird boss fights and the saber combats against other force/saber wielding people is lacking it's no Jedi Outcast or Academy so don't expect any revelation here.The game also offers 3 seperate campaings as part of the the Ultimate Sith Edition pack 2 of wich are what if scenarios and 1 that is part of the main story and offers some foreshadowing of the main characters future by the end which adds a nice touch,all toghether the game is loads of fun once tweaked a bit.

												Personally I very much liked this game. It is one of the few games that has pretty damn good replay value. Having played the first Star Wars: The Force Unleashed for the Wii, I have to say that this game tops that one, and not just because I can now use a normal controller instead of that Wii-mote and nunchuk combo, that was not the best controller combo i've seen. I do also like the choise u have of whether or not to kill Vader or fight the emporer at the end (sorry for any spoilers, if people care). But thats probly just part of the ultimate sith edition, which is why i was impressed by it, having  not played this version before. The only thing that I would complain about is the volume ratio of voices to action to cutscenes. The voices were pretty quiet, the action was louder, but when it came to the cutscenes, it was just blasting (and yes i did play around with my PC sound and the ig sound, so it's not just me).

												We've heard it all at this pt. Overhyped, too short, anticlimactic. This was one of the first games I got on steam. It honestly wasn't worth the $7.50, but no other Star Wars game comes close to this level of force interaction. I'd check it out when it goes on sale ~$2.50; it'd be even better if it was bundled w/ Force Unleashed 2.			",78,20,1,8,2,1,15

												Hmm. Well now this is a tricky one. On the one hand, the combat is refreshing and well played but its also annoying, and if you press the wrong button you can't cancel it. The enemies are interesting and well placed and paced, but their attacks are not so. Sith Master difficulty especially, purge troopers, jumprtoopers and the snipers will just mess you up. Bosses... Bosses are varied, Kazdan Paratus easily being the most difficult of the game, if you include DLC then it's probably Luke SKywalker. Shaak Ti is ridiculously easy. Also the story - praised, and rightly so. Gets a bit broing as you cant skip most cutscenes, which can be annoying, but otherwise well-executed, well made and very interesting crated as the bridge between 3 and 4. In conclusion, despite some MASSIVE graphical errors and sound desyncing, some annoying and frustrating moments and overall shoddy block system... I suggest you get this gameCOMPLETONISTS NOTE: how much do you like stress? completing this game 100% on sith master hurts a lot, but explot the ai a little and have good twitch refleexes and you should be fine :)			",613,188,16,79,74,5,121

												Star Wars the Force Unleashed is the ultimate Star Wars Game. I'm sure that at some point during a Star Wars game we've all said to ourselves ""Why the ♥♥♥♥ can't I just throw this guy off the edge of a cliff with the force?"", well, now you can ACTUALLY DO THAT.This game lets you use all the force goodies from the movies, plus a couple new ones, such as creating a force shockwave and imbuing your lightsaber with sith lightning.The combat is fast paced and dodge-oriented. You get health for killing any enemy, but be careful; on higher difficulties you can be torn asunder by blaster fire very quickly.From a story standpoint, this is a game that takes place during the ""Dark Times"", the period between episodes III and IV where the last of the jedi were being hunted down, and the Rebel Alliance hadn't been formed. The game takes you through the deaths of most of the remaining jedi, and shows the origins of the Rebel Alliance, as well as Vader's plan to overthrow Emperor Palpatine (supporting his actions in Episode VI).

												An Interesting and enjoyable game, while not as good as it potentially could have been the game and its DLC was a great experience. My Problems with the game are that a few time the game just crashed for to apent reason which iannoying but happens to alot of games on the market new and old. My other problem which is minor but also annoying, is that one the cutscence would only stay with story costumes and two when a new chapter is started you put in the story costumer of that level so you have to go into the menu to change it. Overall STU:USE was a great game to play and still surpised me at point in the game which was good as I had previously play the DS version of the game when it first came out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfortunate indeed, I remember playing this game on my Xbox back in the day. I thought I'd download it on steam. Indeed, this game is a terrible port even to this day. The controls just feel clunky, sometimes you wont respond to attacks. It just breaks that feeling of power when you play the game. Such an utter disappointment given that I was quite a fan of the force unleashed when it came out on other platforms. I wouldn't recommend getting this game on steam at all, If you do plan on getting this then you should dust off your PS3 or Xbox and download it from the store or purchase a copy. Please bare in mind, that the game that you play here is not the same as the game you will play on Ps3 or Xbox, the controls for this game are usually smooth and the gameplay is usually fun. It makes you feel like a god going through the first level with all force powers unlocked and feeling like an utter god, destroying general kota. But no. Game is broken, wasted £20, gutted :(			",142,12,3,29,21,0,13

												My feelings are so mixed. On the one hand, I love the idea of the game and the story. Combat is generally fun and there's a bit of customization which I always love. Bonuses take some extra work but nothing crazy and can all be done on the first playthough. My one gripe is with targeting. If I was to take a stab at how the force targeting worked, it would be that it picks a random object in the random direction. This is a HUGE problem when you're trying to say, force lightning a boss, when the game instead picks for you to attack a small item in the background. I'm all for challenge, but I absolutely HATE fighting the game mechanics rather than the actual enemies.			",200,44,1,34,13,1,33

												6/10This feels and plays like a reskinned Dynasty Warriors with a few new mechanics added. The lightsaber use and combo is reminiscent of the aforementioned games, but there's a few new bits that are truly great. I personally love this game, because I enjoy crushing storm troopers against the wall, or smashing the airlock and watching rebels get sucked out. It is, however, incredibly repetitive, and the novelty gets old. I pushed through the glitchy physics, the ugly levels and the poor performance because the AI was very responsive and fun to destroy, and the force powers were just fun to use. The levels are very linear, however, and the port is very poor. The camera controls poorly, and the control scheme is terrible (but if you change it, the QTE prompts don't change). Overall, it felt like a quick cash-in (even though it wasn't), but was still enjoyable FOR ME, because I love this crap. Not everyone does.			",298,108,7,33,27,5,40

This game isn't worth my time and energy.And certainly not the money I've spent when I got it.I've been staying away from playthrough videos since I wanted to know the story but wanted to earn it.After multiple starts over the years, some of which at the beginning because TFU wanted me, and yes I am not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you, INSERT A F*CKING MEMORY CARD into my PC, I simply can't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about it anymore.I want to know the story to end this horrible part of my gaming life.

												I don't quite get the hate for this game. As Star Wars fan fiction goes, it's a superbly written interlude between episodes 3 and 4. That being said, jarring narrative jumps and several characters that get severely short-handed smack of forced cuts due to a rushed development schedule. Interestingly enough, the bonus missions that branch off from the dark (and I mean seriously ♥♥♥♥ing dark) ending are some of the best parts of TFU. Gameplay is serviceable, although the boss fights are a glitchy mess. Definitely play on easy to enjoy this one, or face getting stun-locked every three seconds and having to fight a Jedi while the camera is busy admiring the scenery over in the opposite corner. Highlights: Bringing down a star destroyer with your bare hands (yap), exploring the gooey insides of a Sarlaac and giving Darth Vader a fierce wedgie. Three out of five poorly held lightsabers.

												Keeping it short. Is the game good? Good enough.It is however a fairly unfinished product, reeking of console port-iness. (yes that's a word now).So I would not say that it's worth the 19,99€ pricetag it has. If you however see it during a sale or such for ~75% off, do pick it up. Because the game itself is actually quite worth playing despite it's flaws. It got good gameplay (with occasional bugs). But seeing as the game is quite short it doesn't overstay it's welcome.About it being locked to 30fps. That can be fixed I recall, google ""force unleashed fps unlocker"" or something and you should be able to find a solution to it.Also worth mentioning is that the games keyboard/mouse is a bit wonky, recommend using a controller.

												Finally finished this little gem of a game which I put off playing for sooooo long.First of It has some issues, but nothing really game breaking (for me anyway). I loaded this up set it to full hd 1080p graphics are all set to the max, xbox 360 controller supported sat back and played away like a good little Jedi. The game ran perfectly with no major issues at all nothing game breaking, maybe a few random bad bits of level design but nothing that can't be avoided in the first place. The combat was good, a little stiff and sometimes sluggish especially when standing back up after being knocked down and then getting knocked down straight away and to have that repeat 3 or 4 times is very annoying, but not game breaking.I had an issue on the last level of the game where my sound was missing i could hear slight lightsabre effects but everything else was missing, but this was cured when i downloaded the fixed files from the forum and took seconds to do and was easy to do.The game itself is alright nothing spectacular it reminded me of Devil May Cry meets Star Wars, its a lot of hack and slash but with force powers and cool lightsabres. You dont use any pistols or ranged weapons other than force powers and throwing of the lightsabre, so dont expect to use rifles etc because you cant. There is a basic but effective leveling up system for your character and the force powers, you can also collect crystals for your sabre to change colour and to add perks to your weapon. These can be found through the levels and by completing various challenged throughout the game.The game can be frustrating and sometimes lacks proper intruction but nothing major i found and completed all objectives/side missions and enjoyed doing so. One thing I would recommend is that you take breaks when playing this game i spanned it over 3 nights playing for a couple of hours at a time. I did that because its repetetive the same enemies over and over some with added powers/abilities and the odd mini boss before the inevitable end level boss.That brings me onto the next point i had, Bosses, they didnt seem very tough at all, in fact i found the mini-boss battles with the AT-ST and others that wont be mentioned were a lot tougher at points during the game. The bosses seemed to be over in a few minutes and a lot of them were defeated the exact same way as the previous one but because they were so short i wasnt too fussed.Now the music, the music. What can i say we all know what the Soundtrack to anything Star Wars is gonna sound like and this game does not fail in providing us with the well known star wars classics. They really do make the game feel more epic than it actually is, i was enjoying my lightsabre massacre with the epic star was soundtrack playing in tempo to the slaying of many, many clone troopers. I would say the soundtrack alone made me enjoy this game more than i should of.Graphics - I was running it in 1080p as stated earlier with everything set the to max. It ran perfectly not graphical issues at all it looks quite nice for an old'ish game. The only issue i had was the terrible camera angles in various parts of the game but once again not game breaking.Overall -  There is little in the way of storyline to keep you going it was ok the cutscenes were great, music spot on, graphics were good for the age of the game, QTE was a little annoying with little time to react to some. The only issue i had was with the sound glitching out on the last level but i fixed that so overall i give this game  7/10, could be better but could also be a lot worse, if you are a Star Wars fan and you also like Devil May Cry hack and slash action then this might be the game for you, just dont expect next gen gaming physics or graphics, but what you do get is a few hours of fun.

												I would recommend it only for Star Wars fans. It is kinda fun, yes, but the controls can get real weird, the fighting mechanics can be a routine (hey, it's a hack and slash).The story is what kept me playing. I often had thoughts of ""oh please let this level end and let me know what happens"" in some awful levels. This game is very story-rich and for any Star Wars fan, that should be enough.The difficulty is a little more hard than it's sequel though but no problem with that.Some glitches, the locked frame rate.. I don't care, I enjoyed it and left me wanting more (and so, I went and played TFUII)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has great gameplay and a decent story. Some parts can get a bit agravating in terms of jumping or using the proper force power. Never the less, this is one of the better star wars action games I have come across. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to find out what it feels like to be a force user in Star Wars.

												I enjoyed the console version of this game and was looking forward to seeing it in action on my more than capable pc.Despite this, the Force Unleashed I played on Steam was a mess of slow loading flora and fauna, missing colours and objects replaced by unsightly black blobs, zero customization when it comes to graphics and most annoyingly of all2 of the levels, the second and last level were lacking almost completely in sound.Bizarre. This is an OK game that hasn't aged well, but the bugs on this PC version render it completely unplayable.I would not buy this product, and I'm highly disappointed at such a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥port.FOR THOSE FACING THE SAME PROBLEM, there is a patch availiable on steamforums, but I cannot possibly give a positive review to a game that relies on fan-made patches to work.

												Why did they not continue this franchise with a new installment every year?!  This game has good graphics for the release date: 2010.  The controls are tight but at times a little slow to respond.  It's a great hack and slash style game with plenty of force powers.  I wish the boss fights could be a little more in depth and complex. The only bad part in the whole game is when you have to use the force power to bring down a battle cruiser.  Youtube that part because the gameplay of that fight seems a little glitchy and it is easier to beat if don't follow their instructions for that particular fight.  They really should have continued this franchise with an installment every year.  The second game in the series improved much upon this one.  Had the series continued it would have been truely amazing by now.			",107,8,2,21,2,1,8

												First off I'm a star wars nut. love the lore and the movies etc yadayada...I for one love this game for what it is. You play as Vader's secret apprentice and live by far one of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest lives in the galaxy. I wont go into any details for spoiler reasons. I will say I do love the story because of how snugly it fits within the canon of the universe, aside from never being mentioned Starkiller and his adventure could easily be part of the offical lore of the setting.Now onto the game itself.First off this is clearly a port from the console, it feels WRONG on a keyboard and probably for that reason, fortunately if you have a controller you'll be right at home. Being a port (and a fairly lazy one at that) it's got it's share of odd bugs, fortunately none of them are too horrifying, aside from some noticable pop in on the larger more busy worlds and some textures you won't have alot of visual problems. But you will notice the occasional physics bug where a person suddenly goes mach 2 in any given direction.Speaking of physics the havok engine is used for maximum lulz here. it's WAY too easy to just pick up like a trash can and knock everyone over, the second you touch them they go ragdoll and collapse and act llike they've forgotten how their body works its pretty entertaining. That being said it obviously makes your force powers seem ridiculous in comparison, take that and the fact that more than half the time your enemies will be utterly helpless against the power of the force and you can really feel like a tiny god at times.All in all a fun game but it's fairly dated at this point and as I said before a is a lousy port. still pretty fun			",142,6,2,13,2,0,12

												Fear = AngerAnger = HateHate = SufferingFear = The Path to the Dark SideGotta find myself something to Fear then!!It's a really good story for all SW fans, though i'm only part way through the game. my only complaint is that the controls/combat doesn't seem as fluid as it should be to allow for proper utilization of all the mechanics the game has to offer. it's hard to feel like a hardcore force wielder kicking butt in the middle of a fight when i'm having a hard time getting the character to throw the right item at the right object/enemy. having to stop to aim and fire force held objects takes time that interupts the flow of potentially awesome combat. this all seems fleshed out by the sequal to a much greater extent, though.The camera work is mildly tricky.The voice over work is usually well done.In the end it may seem like i'm not enjoying the game, but i am. i most definitely love the dark side of the force			",276,42,3,67,3,1,28

												I usually love star wars, though this? A ♥♥♥♥ing abomination, I played it for 14 minutes, an then stopped. Reason I stopped? Not because it was bad, or because they game was bad, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics. Literally everything in the foreground is pretty good looking I can see everything perfectly, everything in the background? A bloody disaster, don't waste your money, buy a real star wars game, like Knights of the Old Republic. Something more fun, and actually works. This game took over 5 ♥♥♥♥ing hours to download, I had to keep pausing and resuming the download. I was up till 5 am trying to download it, I started download it at 10 pm the night before!!!

												I played this game on my Wii when I was younger and it seemed much more fun back then. Nevertheless, I find the game to  be flawed in only a few ways.Flaws: The controls to PC have been ported horrifically and the menus are difficult to navigate because of this. There are also a few sound and texture glitches with Juno (the character's Orthopox 13 if you will) when she's trying to give you instructions. Sometimes when she says something, the audio doesn't kick in and you can only know that she's talking if you have subtitles turned on.Other than those few unpleasantries, this is a very enjoyable Star Wars game that is lore-friendly and loads of fun if you've ever wanted to be an all powerful Sith Lord.

												It's nice, i've already played the game enough times on console, obviously the issues of this game range from the narrative, to the gameplay, to even the freaking sense that the story may or may not add to the canon, it's all in good faith tho, the main thing, and the main complaint that a lot of pc gamers are having, is that this pc version it's quite bad, it's not as horrible as say something like Arkham Knight, but it's pretty bad, luckily, fixable.The first problem it's that there's a framerate limit at 30fps, you can disable this by downloading a patch for the game in pcgamingwiki.The second problem were some visual glitches that were frankly, annoying. I solve this by editing the config file and enabling clothe psysics, also something that you can do by following the instructions from pcgaming wiki.And finally, apparently there were some levels that were missing sounds, and even music, i manage to fix this by downloading another patch for the game also on pcgamingwiki.The point that im trying to make, besides the fact that you can find basically every fix on the internet, it's that the game definitley needs some work done, and it's a damn shame because im sure plenty of people won't even realize about this fixes until they have refunded the game, or just get sick of the issues, at the moment i haven't experience any crashes whatsoever, and after every fix the only problem i encountered it's the 30fps affects the cutscenes and there doesn't seem to be a fix for it, but whatever, im pleased with the actual game running at 60fps, and it looks great, i definitley recommend it, if you can get it on a sale, and if you can bare the ten minutes that it will take you to fix the issues that developers should have already fix in the first place.

												Excellent game!  Ive heard many of the bad reviews have been stemming from people who are playing this on a keyboard.  You are a tool if you do that.  This game is meant to be played with a controller and always has been.  Now onto the game.  Its a full-on action game that does HUGE justice to how powerful the force actually is.  You are given numerious ways to eliminate your enemies via hack n slashing or using force powers/objects in the environment.  It has a light RPG system for you to upgrade your character.  I like the that you can also learn new combos to add in the mix.  You are tasked with hunting down the remaining jedi spread across the galaxy.  This leads to the game taking you to varied locations throughout the universe.  For example the games 1st level is a TIE Fighter factory which is pretty sick and then you travel to a world that is used as a trash can.  A junkyard world if you will.  The only knock I would say is that the targeting system is a little off and controls take a bit to get used to but when you do; you will feel like a god.  Runs silky smooth on Windows 7 x64.

												DO NOT BUY THIS! The force unleashed is a great game, probably my favorite star wars game, but oh god... The PC port is AWFUL. Cons-Skybox has been removed, so not rather than clouds and stars, you get black hall of mirrors that overlaps everything on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ screen.-30 FPS cap. I have a not so good computer, but i can run older games pretty well, and when i look directly at the ground to avoid looking at the sky long enough to see my real FPS, I can only get 30. Although i know i could cap off around 50 or so.-Controlles. ""Oh, you thought you were navagating menus like a normal game? no no no, use the arrow keys, and press enter to select, and it only works sometimes. And thats assuming the menu options even load!""I cannot stress enough that you should go get a ps2 and play this, but not on PC. The game is only 5.99 right now but i feel like i should be paid for downloading it.			",26,5,0,3,9,0,0

												Having made it to the end I really cannot recommend this game at all.I have read that a lot of people gave up before the third level - which is understandable - but if you continue on there is actually some game to enjoy.You get used to the controls after a while and work out how the force powers work to actually enjoy using them, but it is overall ruined by insanely badly done boss fights the like of which I don't think I have seen in over 30 years of gaming.The developers seemed to hate the player and while bestowing them with playable sections they had to punish them with the bosses.I rarely need youtube videos to help me play games but I looked up nearly every fight as it was so tedious to try to work out what you were doing wrong.And having seen how to do it they then rarely presented a challenge as it was just spamming their weakness until they died.Ignorance of game mechanics when you haven't been taught is no great weakness on the players part it is the failure of the designers.I also - which I never do - looked to see if there was an infinite health cheat just to be able to play the game without the tedium of dying and starting again.  Sadly there wasn't and I consider having even looked really bad.I got it in a bundle and if you can then try it but don't expect too much.  Definitely don't buy it even on sale.

												If you're a fan of Star Wars, just buy it, realy, the game value every single second, the difficulty is very high, and the bosses are a little repetitive, but is always fun to kill a Rancor or an AT-ST, realy worth.And the strongest point in this game is the history, this game tells the history of the creation of the rebel alliance, and the history life of Starkiller, one of the strongest ""jedi"" knights ever !!!.As I said, if you enjoy Star Wars, you HAVE to buy it, if you're a fan of Hack n' Slash, it's a good pick too.

												THere's not much to The Force Unleashed. It's middle of the road in terms of quality and the backstory and characterization leave much to be desired. But the bottom line is it's fun to throw heavy things at your enemies. And then impale them. And then electrocute them. And then throw them again. Yeah, that's The Force Unleashed. I HIGHLY reccommend you get an Xbox 360 controller though.			",129,35,5,20,20,3,30

I never finished it due to the fact that its a console port, I made it to the scene where you have to bring down a space ship with your mind and couldnt due to mouse.

												I don't quite get the hate for this game. As Star Wars fan fiction goes, it's a superbly written interlude between episodes 3 and 4. That being said, jarring narrative jumps and several characters that get severely short-handed smack of forced cuts due to a rushed development schedule. Interestingly enough, the bonus missions that branch off from the dark (and I mean seriously ♥♥♥♥ing dark) ending are some of the best parts of TFU. Gameplay is serviceable, although the boss fights are a glitchy mess. Definitely play on easy to enjoy this one, or face getting stun-locked every three seconds and having to fight a Jedi while the camera is busy admiring the scenery over in the opposite corner. Highlights: Bringing down a star destroyer with your bare hands (yap), exploring the gooey insides of a Sarlaac and giving Darth Vader a fierce wedgie. Three out of five poorly held lightsabers.

												Bad console port of an amazing game and contrary to what is said this game does have controller support for Xbox360 controllers.-The camera is awkward and the aiming of force powers and lock-on is awful, but it was for console and this game is around 8 years old so what do you expect.-The graphic options are preset so you can't mess about with resolution so prepare to deal with old graphics.-There is no actual in-game tutorial, you simply learn as you go through on screen pop ups when you acquire new skills.-Although when you load the game up it asks what resolution you want to play in, it lies and you can't really change it.-The plot is amazing-Using force powers is awesome-Being able to combo enemies with a lightsaber that you can upgrade is brilliant-The environments are varied-The enemies are varied and can be challenging when first encountered but when you learn thier move set they're not                      too bad to take down, however when you're outnumbered by 5 enemy types trying to take them down is still a real challenge.# It's a million times better than ""The Force Unleashed 2"" which plays like a fricken DLC to this game.

												This title's plagued by the obvious flaw of a Star Wars game in the Rise of the Empire Era. It's got retcons like no other game I've seen, other than SR4. The core gameplay is good. Jump into the air, slam into the ground and take out a squad of Stormtroopers. BUT there are parts that are plagued by awful, awful. AWFUL design choices. Like the bit where you have to bring down a Star Destroyer? Not possible, even on the lowest difficulty. NONE of your force powers have any effect on the TIE fighters. If they'd have made it possible to electrocute the fighters out of the air, I'd enjoy that part. Also, no controller support. Boo.			",131,16,1,22,12,0,6

												I've looked at buying this game for years.... I cant believe I didnt get this game earlier based on the negative reviews!I've played jedi knight acadamy for years (and still play it) waiting for another melee SW game to release. This is the most fun I've had playing a SW game since Jedi Knight Acadamy. Its worth buying just for the story. Unless your so picky, and so criticle with techincalities in terms of game play, you should enjoy this game weather your a fan of SW or not.Graphics are still good considering the release date, Sound / music *its SW. Nuff said* game play is action packed. Combos, melee and massive force abilities, *Semi* destructable environment. Customized options- Light saber and saber effects, massive wardrobe options, ""talent tree"" skill points to customize force and melee options etc.I havent even finished the game and I've went back to replay some of my completed levels to aquire bonus items. Yes... you can go back and replay any level you want at any time WITH your upgraded force powers. Its fun going back to some of the early level missions and plowing through them with your new force abilities and saber attacks.Replay on this game IMO is fantastic. Great purchase. I would easily pay full price for this game. BTW... i dont feel like the controls are clunky. its like any other game. you get used to it very  quickly.			",86,1,1,13,3,0,9

I am really sorry Disney nuked the EU because this story could be awesome as canon.And gameplay is a lot of fun.

												Bought this during a sale and the price I paid was well worth it. A few bad things though. This PC port took me a bit of time getting used to the controls, especially the QTE's, but I'm fairly new to PC gaming in general. If you've played the original and wanting this for the DLC I would probably stay away unless your a huge fan. The vanilla game though is great with a few annoying parts (mainly certain enemies....:/).Although though I fairly enjoyed the ride and the pacing was great for me personally. I'm not into huge games nowadays due to time constraints so an hour here and there was great. Completed entirely at around 12 hours (DLC, all collectables, etc).			",23,5,0,6,0,0,1

TL;DR: over-the-top force powers do not save a lackluster story and poor level designIt’s called the Force Unleashed because you’ll get to use force powers in full overdrive. That means force blasts that push entire armies over cliffs, lightning that electrifies everything, and super high force jumps. The pinnacle of the game is crashing down a Star Destroyer into a planet using nothing but the force.  If this is enough to win you over, you will definitely have a blast playing this game. The force’s not the only thing unleashed though: the illogical over-the-top story and level and gameplay design are all over the place.The story’s decent, you hunt down hidden Jedi as Darth Vader’s assassin. It’s a pretty dark story, with a predictable redemption arc. Most Star Wars games offer you a light and a dark choice, here confined to a single choice as to which final boss you fight. It would have been much more interesting if the story had followed the dark route, evidenced by 2/3 of the 3 DLC (included in this edition) following the alternative dark ending.The biggest problem is the ambivalent nature of the game. There’s some dark nightmarish stuff, definitely unsuited for younger players. You get to kill legions of enemies, but to keep the age rating in check there’s no blood or dismemberment:  the gameplay is a tame, almost cartoony version of God of War, which contrast heavily with the dark story.While all the levels are good looking, they’re plagued by some odd design issues. You’ll repeatedly fall, jump, or get pushed to your death in one of the game’s many abysses, sending you back to the last save point, forcing you to replay part of the level. Often irritating, especially in connection with the unskippable CGI scenes. The many legions of enemies are too easily defeated, the only challenges posed by the game’s Jedi bosses. Those boss fights are generally fun, but all come down to using the same tactics, and are often plagued by a second adversary: the camera.In short, it’s fun to play around with the force powers and to fight iconic bosses, but the gameplay and level design are not good enough to make you want to come back for more.There’s far better games out there where you can play with the force, the Jedi Knight series chief among them. 6/10			",19,4,0,5,7,0,14

												Star Wars - The Force Unleashed: PLayed through from 4/29/2015 - 5/3/2015Star Wars - The Force Unleashed is a capable hack and slash romp through the Star Wars Universe. The story is told picking up from the end of Episode III and fills in some of the abyssmal gap between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy. Some fair plot twists and some darn good storytelling make this a game worth playing for any Star Wars fan. There are several familiar character cameos and some nice subtle tie in's from both trilogies. All of the characters are very well voice acted and the story elements provided me with the majority of the incentive to get through the title. Light Saber combat is fluid and fun against most of the weaker to medium foes. However, the larger enemies and boss encounters end up being an excersize in discovery and repetition. That is, you find the bosses weakness and continually exploit it until victory is achieved. I found myself spamming force lighting for most of the game to this effect.The control scheme did not translate well to the mouse and keyboard. I would recommend a gamepad for this title. Either a 360 or PD3 controller should do the trick. Force Grip and throw seemed to be fairly useless for the most part as my inteded throw destination was often overwritten by a completely random direction. Similarly, in the boss fights the camera postioning becomes fixed and I often found myself tossing lightning around the arena rather than at my enemy.Some simple custimization options let the player make small changes in the protagonists appearance which is a nice touch. In the end I would give Star Wars - The Force Unleashed a 6/10 for a casual non-star wars fan for the poor combat dynamics in the boss fights. I would award it with an 8/10 for a Star Wars Fan for a spectacular universe expanding story and tie in with some serviceable lightsaber combat.			",74,2,0,8,2,0,12

												Amazing game! Has an awesome story that fits right in with the existing one for the main Star Wars series. It is extremly fun with awesome visuals and very well choreographed cut scense. You trully feel like a Jedi/Sith Lord while fighting against hoards of enemies.HOWEVER: This game was not ported over very well for the PC. I HIGHLY recommend using a contoller with this game. Even then I feel that Lucas Arts know how to make an amazing story with epic fight scenes and doesn't know how to make a decent platformer, as climbing and jumping from platforms is very frustraiting. Fortunetly the main game will not ask you to do that very often, it is only when searching for collectables that this becomes a real problem. Another issue is that boss battles can be frustraiting and tedius, with almost all of your attacks being blocked and bosses using unblockable moves. However even with these frustrating moments I still had a a lot of fun in this game.Overall, if you're a Star Wars fan you should love this game! And even if you're not this is still a very fun/awesome game!			",415,115,2,23,15,2,38

												My feelings are so mixed. On the one hand, I love the idea of the game and the story. Combat is generally fun and there's a bit of customization which I always love. Bonuses take some extra work but nothing crazy and can all be done on the first playthough. My one gripe is with targeting. If I was to take a stab at how the force targeting worked, it would be that it picks a random object in the random direction. This is a HUGE problem when you're trying to say, force lightning a boss, when the game instead picks for you to attack a small item in the background. I'm all for challenge, but I absolutely HATE fighting the game mechanics rather than the actual enemies.			",200,44,1,34,13,1,33

												Unfortunate indeed, I remember playing this game on my Xbox back in the day. I thought I'd download it on steam. Indeed, this game is a terrible port even to this day. The controls just feel clunky, sometimes you wont respond to attacks. It just breaks that feeling of power when you play the game. Such an utter disappointment given that I was quite a fan of the force unleashed when it came out on other platforms. I wouldn't recommend getting this game on steam at all, If you do plan on getting this then you should dust off your PS3 or Xbox and download it from the store or purchase a copy. Please bare in mind, that the game that you play here is not the same as the game you will play on Ps3 or Xbox, the controls for this game are usually smooth and the gameplay is usually fun. It makes you feel like a god going through the first level with all force powers unlocked and feeling like an utter god, destroying general kota. But no. Game is broken, wasted £20, gutted :(			",142,12,3,29,21,0,13

												If you're a fan of starwars, and you can get this super cheap, I'd recomend it. The story is interesting as far as star wars games usually go, however there's not much replay value, and it's not exactly what I'd call the best PC port of all time. It's good enough if you can find a price point that justifies those facts. Being able to use the force as fluidly as is possible in this game is what really sets it apart. Get rid of the force powers and I'd say skip this one.			",129,24,2,17,11,1,20

												The Bad: Medicore, frequently repetitive gameplay with often unresponsive controls and a very cool Force throwing system with utterly impenetrable aiming mechanics (At best, you can move the object/individual you're trying to throw vaguely in the direction you intend it to go in, and hope that it lands somewhere in the vicinity. More often than not it just drops straight down, or goes flying in a completely different direction...I'm still not sure why.)Occasionally hairpullingly frustrating when there are massed ranged troops, some of whom have weapons that can stun you or knock you back, leading to instances where you get chain stunned and take an enormous amount of damage with little to nothing you can do about it. I'm assuming that in these instances you're supposed to use your incredible Force powers to hurl some of the random debris that sits around every environment in the game into the groups of your enemies but the aformentioned uncontrollable aiming system makes trying to hit anything that you're not locked onto an exercise in futility, so the debris mostly gets in the way (you can also Force-grab enemies, but in some areas the debris is so thick that half the time Starkiller ended up grabbing random detritus and violently throwing it out of the way of his foes like some sort of telekinetic custodian clearing away trash in mortal fear of a personal injury lawsuit) so you're reduced to wading into the thick of your foes as best you can, Force-dashing along the way to avoid the stream of rockets, electric rounds, etc. that are being shot at you, and then flailing about with your lightsaber.There are a number of simple combos that you can use in combat, but after about halfway through the game most of the enemies have shields that block your Force powers until you do enough damage to them, at which point they're almost dead anyway, so in practice you wind up spamming attack a lot.Now and again you'll come across a larger enemy (Rancor, AT-ST, etc.) and that'll be cool the first few times, but after the third or fourth you'll realize that you can kill it by popping out of cover, zapping it with a full bar of Force Lightning, then popping back into cover and waiting for your mana to regenerate (which it does almost instantly) until its health is in the red and you can run up to it and kill it with a quicktime event. The combination of this, the aformentioned stunlock issue, and the Force-blocking shields mean that a squad of Stormtroopers in 'Force Unleashed' is generally much more dangerous to you than a pair of Rancors.Possibly the crowning achievement of the game's bad design occurs near the end of the game, where an event that should've been an incredible, 'holy crap' experience is instead reduced by an actively deceptive onscreen prompt and poor controls into an exercise in absolute, controller-throwing frustration.The Good: Absolutely spot-on voice acting (Vader sounds like Vader, Palpatine sounds like Palpatine, all of the new characters are on point as well), a very strong story, and gameplay that is often fun despite itself. It has its (many, many) flaws, but the core mechanic of Force manipulation is enough to sustain the game. Almost every level has some sort of awful. hilarious thing you can do to your foes, from dropping an Ugnaught into an active carbonite bath, to slowly pressing a Jawa against a laser fence, to throwing a Stormtrooper through a window and into a stream of flaming railgun exhaust (or into the vast void of space, or into a Sarlacc's mouth, or...) to just plain hurling them against the wall until they stop moving. The Force Push also figures into this, and the first time the stars align and you chain it into a combo that targets a cluster of unshielded troops, hurling them screaming off of a platform, it will be absolute magic.If you're a Star Wars fan (and honestly, who isn't?) I'd grab it, but I can't recommend it to someone who isn't attached to the mythos and is just looking for a good game to play.			",122,15,3,8,12,3,29

												I recommend it because...well...I don't know. I love Star Wars. I love the universe. And of all Darth Vader is my favorite.I enjoyed the game for what little hours I played it, but overall...the game plays like an unfinished beta. The controls are for the upmost frustrating on many occassions, the camera angles can make you rip your hair, the sensitivity seems to be everywhere, the levels are...inconsistent I would say. Don't even dare try to play it with a keyboard, it'll frustrate you. Best with a controller. The menu, options menu (paticulary graphics), and load times are horrid are amateurish. It just feels very....rushed and unpolished and like a bargin bin action-fighter rpg.However...if your Star Wars fan. You'll enjoy it. Definitely without a doubt. But $19.99? Pfft. Hell no. Buy it on a sale.			",134,14,1,19,16,0,16

												I have also played this game back when it released on the xbox 360. Star Wars The Force Unleashed is a very fun, but messy game. It requires a few mods to make it run well on the PC (60 fps, better textures) but it can be worth it if you are willing to invest the time and work. The game runs about 10-12 hours if you want to do everything, about 7-8 hours for one playthrough on the medium difficulty. It should be noted that there is a glitch in the Steam version of the game, where the final 2 levels lack any sort of sound effects. Again, this can be fixed with a mod, but this problem has been around since at least 2010 and has never been officially fixed.Is the game good? Yes, but it requires a little effort on the part of the player and it is by no means worth 20 dollars almost 8 years after it's release. If you can pick it up for $3 during a sale and are willing to put a little work in to getting it running, then it can be a worthwhile experience.			",139,21,2,44,8,0,27

												Pros:-Amazing story that follows the events of the prequils. -Decent graphics-GameplayCons:-Gameplay: I put this in cons as well because at times the game feels unbalanced. Either making you much more powerful or making the enemies more powerful than you. It may have just been my experience but the fight with Shaak Ti felt even and fun. Then when I would fight Proxy it was not fun. It never felt completely balanced at one point during the game. Again, my experience may be different from others.-Very, VERY short game. 9 chapters total.  Took maybe 3 hours to beat, and I took my time.I would get the game if you're a fan of the Star Wars universe. However it's not something you NEED to play. I got it at a great price during a steam sale and I wouldn't buy it again unless it was on sale.			",168,13,2,13,18,2,19

												This game was on my TODO list for a while. Never got to it. After watching STAR WARS: The Force Awakens I was excited for some more STAR WARS action. So I decided to give it a go.While a worthwhile game, it is ruined by a terrible PC port. Graphics are glitchy. Game crashed on me multiple times. Worse of all, the majority of sound effects vanished for me in the last couple of levels. Found out this was a well known bug that could be fixed by an UNOFFICIAL patch. Terrible.However, withing the steaming mess lies the core of a really good STAR WARS game. Something that fans of the old JEDI KNIGHT games will surely enjoy. The story is decent and playing as StarKiller can be excilerating.In summary, this game is a worthwhile experience for STAR WARS fans and not much else. Pity...it could have been much better with a bit more work and a MUCH better PC port.			",274,98,5,37,23,6,58

												It's a good game. It reminds me of when I played it on the nintendo wii. But to be honest the wii version is better.The pc version has extra levels (Jedi Temple, Tatooine, and Hoth)But in the regular levels,  I don't like how I can be wearing sith robes but in the cutscenes I am wearing the defult clothes for the level. And sometimes the audio for the cutscenes is off. That's another reason why I recomend the wii version, the cutscenes change what you are wearing what you put on on the Rouge Shadow. Your lightsaber changes in the cutscenes as well, and you can also customize the lightaber hilt. But the pc version is still really cool, I'm just saying, if you want it from steam pick it up on sale or something. ",61,14,1,16,11,0,4

												Make sure you play this with an xbox 360 controller. The PC controls are impossible to deal with. It is quite important that you lock on to some of your enemies. Needless to say the Control Key is what is used for locking on and when you're moving around as much as you are in this game you don't have the extra fingers to hold down the control Key. It's highly recommended you stick with a console controller. tho it's not impossible to play with said keyboard the 2nd boss fight is a damn nightmare with out a controller			",275,99,8,24,25,5,17

												Playing the Stardestroyer mission on mouse and keyboard will make saints blaspheme and atheists pray.Still a fun game even today, and a joy for fans of the franchise.My only real complaint is that pretty much all the boss battles have a god-awful semi-fixed camera angle. I think they were trying to make boss fights feel more cinimatic, but ultimately it just frustates the gameplay. I should also mention that this game has an unnecessary ammount of quicktime events, but I can't fault it too hard there as it came out in 2009, just when game developers' erections for quick time events had reached their maximum.

												So this is not a 100% reccomended title, simply for some issues with it bieng older.So, by far this is one of the best Starwars games out there. Decent lightsaber combat along with using storm troopers as a human shield then using him to knock down his friends. The quicktime event are pretty decent also, even though I suck at them. Aside from the combat mechanics, the story (so far for me) is pretty good.But it is a older game soooo, it has some issues. Namily the fact that unless you have a Xbox controller is it impossible to get past the first Star Destoyer pull down minigame, as you only get the correct speed for pulling it down for a short time before the mouse suppot kinda gives out, and you only get about 1/4 the pull down speed. Now this wouldnt be so bad if TIE fighters didn't continuly spawn and would reach you before you could rip the Star Destoyer out of the sky. Can rip Star Destroyers out of orbit, cant throw purge troopers or small walkers. Will update once I get my hands on a Xbox controller.			",63,6,0,6,9,0,7

												This game is decently good.  If it's on sale, I definitely recommend it.  The historical context is an interesting possible back story for the Rebellion, but the personal romance portion of the plot is not well done.  The graphics are good during combat, not as good during cutscenes.  The walking is awkward, and the cutscenes don't display your customized lightsaber and outfit.  The game is short, but the gameplay still gets repetitive.  Blowing things up with massive force powers is pretty awesome though.  Overall, The Force Unleashed is not as good as games like Jedi Academy, but it's still a fun thing to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game actually delivers on its name sake. Its total power fantasy Jedi badassery. Some quicktime button mashing did leak in but the story and charaters more than make up for it. DX9 Console textures are abundant but its actually a very pretty and polished game. If you haven't tried it and you also own an Xbox controller for windows It's a must buy at sale prices.

												A great Star Wars game that makes you jump and squeal like a rabid fanboy as you throw, zap and annihilate everything that comes in your path. Unfortunately you need a computer that can run crysis at a solid 60+ fps in order to atleast get a smooth framerate with this game. Why? Because this game is the worst PC port in the history of video gaming (in my opinion) you cannot adjust shadows, anti aliasing, dynamic shadows, video quality etc. The game only gives you the option of choosing the resolution and ""high quality"" (on/off). Force Unleashed has a 30 frame cap, which means even if you can play Crysis 2 at 100+ fps, this game will be locked at a solid 30, which is a damn shame. Aside from that, the game is fun, always entertaining and with all the hidden unlockables AND the extra DLC missions (what if Vader died and Starkiller took his place) give you a taste of an alternate Star Wars Universe. Overall, a good game, only ruined by shoddy porting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Force Unleashed is a Good game if you buy the Ultimate Sith Edition sense it comes with the DLC (which was only 1 pack) but on to the review.The Game is a Enjoyable and Entertaining game (even though it takes only 3 hours to complete it without going off track) probably the best one yet in my honest opinion.Pros:Story is GoodLevel Design doesn't feel Repetative You can use a controller on the PC Version (FULL controller support which is a plus)Force Powers don't feel Bland Dark Story and EnviromentCons:Laggy (and I own a Gaming Computer with all the latest software at the time this review was done)Short (if you don't play the DLC)Graphics Look a little out dated in some spotsif you're looking for a good star wars game this is one (along with the second) and then there's Knights of the old republic and Republic commando along with probably the best Star wars game yet Battlefront ( 1 and 2 (two is the best one though)) ",109,12,1,20,0,0,1

												The Force Unleashed is a great game, if a little akward to control at times.  The game really shows how badass jedi/sith can be, and is great for stress relief.  My only two complaints are that (1) the game can be difficult to control in combat (you feel knockback way more than some enemies, and can easily get stun locked at times), and (2) the DLC (included in teh Ultimate Sith Edition) feels very separate from the game itself.  The DLC isn't added into the game itself, to allow you to continue levelling up and such in new missions, but instead are three new options when you start a new game, providing you a pre-levelled character to use.Overall, though, it's a great game, and definitely one I'd recommend to all Star Wars fans.(PS, if my low game time seems suspicious, it's because I put most of my time into this game on my console, and only recently purchased it for Steam)			",483,157,6,67,60,8,98

												This verdict is contingent on how strongly you feel about Star Wars. If you're the kind of person who gets really upset at George Lucas' meddling with the original films and reads the expanded universe books, you'll find some stuff to hate. If you're less invested and just enjoy the movies and games, you'll probably have a lot of fun with this one. I can appreciate The Force Unleashed as a game, but I don't like how it handled some aspects of the universe. I did have a lot of fun, though, and to a lot of people that's what's really important. I hear the console versions have a few less problems, so it's probably better to play it there.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/02/star-wars-force-unleashed.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												Ok, I've not put many hours into this game, but I think I can already describe it to you.It's a Star Wars game. I'm a big fan of the franchise myself, so for me this game it always was a must-have in my collection.The story is simple and a bit cartoonish (not even close to the level of depth of the two KOTORs), but it's not so bad.***Minor Spoiler ahead***You are Starkiller. Darth Vader has adopted you after killing your father, because the Force is strong in you. He has trained you for Jedi-killing, until one day the Emperor discover your existence and cast away.So you will be a dark jedi for the first part of the game (in which at the moment of the review I actually am), but I sense, as the story progresses, that you will find the light... Kudos to the writers for letting me play as Darth Vader in the beginning (a big wet dream of mine) and taste the evil as I kill the good guys.The graphic is excellent and the combat system, which is the core element of the game, is ok.The music and the sound effects are perfect.The urge for writing this review came for the really bad things you will find.First of all I think that every bug I encountered depends on a disappointing PC port.-The game is buggy as hell. I think no game other than Alpha Protocol in my library have forced me to restart the pc more than this one.You will find yourself frustated a lot during the course of the game because every now and then it crashes without a motive.-In some cases you will fall between the layers of the level. In that case you are forced to restart the mission (if you don't have a previous save).-The boss battle are terrible. It's the first time in a game that I actually hate to be in a boss fight. The force system depends on you facing the item/character you want to use your powers on. In the boss battle this is a nightmare. The game loses the over-the-shoulder view and becomes a fixed third-person view in which you see yourself and the stage (like the Scarecrow parts of Batman: Arkham Asylum). I often couldn't face quickly the boss, and this is a game in which speed is essential.-The sound is perfect but something has gone wrong, because I can not hear the voice of the actors during the cutscenes (which are crucial to the understanding of the story and actually well-done). So I have to play with my headphones and this actually solved the problem.(???)Coclusion:Star Wars The Force Unleashed is a beauty. It's really fun to play, good to watch and hear. It could have been a perfect game, if not for the bad PC port and some questionable gameplay choices.If you are a Star Wars fan chances are you already have this one in your collection.If not ask yourself if you want to play a really good game with lots of bug and glitches.

												Do I recommend the game? Easy answer: Yes, when it's on sale. It's a typical hack'n'slash game set in the Star Wars Galaxy, if you like one of them, go ahead and buy the game! If you like both you'll really enjoy this game.I had much fun playing this. The gameplay is fun, the story is interesting (although a bit too linear I'd say), and graphics are okay too. I'm playing this on a asus laptop on highest settings and I had no bugs, except a sound bug.This bug means, as it seems to be a general bug, the sound fx is cut off in some stages, that means you don't hear the rockets when they're shot at you, which can get a bit irritating and frustrating, but okay.Sadly Disney didn't accept the story to produce their own series, but it's still interesting.

												I first got this game on PSP. Yeah... I completed it, and I think I enjoyed it. This was before I became a ""Gaming Connoisseur"". A little while into the future, my father bought me two games for my birthday; Quantum of Solace, and The Force Unleashed, on Xbox 360. I was so annoyed that my father actually had the audacity to buy me games. I played up to the Felucia level on the 360 in The Force Unleashed and stopped. Why did I do that? I was cutting my nose off in spite of my face. Quantum of Solace, which was actually a good game, and The Force Unleashed were traded in for some other crap game, I can't remember which. I feel very guilty for the lack of gratitude I showed my father. Mostly because The Force Unleashed is an enjoyable game, except for the obvios heavily criticised flaws. One annoying flaw is that when you get close to edges of land mass it kinda sucks you off the edge, which makes the platforming annoying. Keyboard controls are alright though, which is nice.

The game freezes on a battle with proxy and I can't move past the quick time event. Other than that, I would recommend this game to any star wars fans.			",97,3,1,16,2,0,2

												game requires a radeon or geforce processor but recommends intel core.    Weird.  Anyway, don't buy the game if you have intel because it'll be practically unplayable.With that said the game is good if you're a fan of star wars.  If you aren't a fan this game will be mediocre.

												The game is fun; however, the gameplay does run stale pretty quickly.The controls for SWTFU are wonky and somewhat poorly ported for the PC version.If you decide to purchase Star Wars The Force Unleashed, I recommend playing with a controller, as the game was best made to be played NOT on a keyboard.All in all, I'd say the game is worth getting, despite how quickly I grew bored of it.

												I am an avid star wars fan, and played Jedi outcast and jedi academy as a young teenager. Absolutly loved both games to death! I walked into this game expecting it to be of a similiar gameplay type. Unfortunatly, it was much different than I expected. The gameplay felt really unnatural. maybe it was the way the camera moved, but the way the main character jumped felt really weird. The overall mechanics of the game were really distracting to the badassness of the level design. The level design, (general atmosphere) was wonderful! But the gameplay was very painful. I havne't yet completeed the game. It feels more like a bad movie than an active adventure through the star wars universe. It was a valid attempt at make a star wars franchise game. Nice try, no cigar.			",25,0,0,2,2,0,0

												I want to recommend it.. I really do. Even as someone who doesn't really care about Star Wars, I still had some fun here. Its got a pretty simple story and the gameplay can be fun when its not frustrating as hell. But personal feelings aside, the game is a sloppy mess. It feels and plays like it wasn't quite finished. The controls sometimes don't respond properly and the physics go whack at times. Textures pop in and out when they shouldn't, camera work is often a pain, blah blah.But hey if you really love Star Wars and don't mind a game that plays like a half-finished Devil May Cry, you'll enjoy this.. probably. And lightsabres are cool too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a very nice addition to the Star Wars universe. The story is nice, the characters are good and the graphics are really nice, but you don't have access to the ""advanced"" configurations, limiting you to choose between low, medium or high graphics without changing things like texture quality or anti-aliasing. It has an FPS cap on it, but there are mods made to cap it higher or uncap it. Gameplay is good and combat is pretty decent, but the force usage is clunky. For example, if you grab a trooper and wants to throw it at a wall that is in front of you, there's a high chance you end up just throwing him up the air, because it's weird like that, but when it works as intended, it's really satisfying. Overall, it is a pretty good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the coolest ""Be a Jedi and kill Stormtroopers"" game this side of Jedi Outcast. If you want to do that, this game is a must buy. Lifting up an explosive barrel, infusing it with lightning, throwing it at a squad of Stormtroopers, lifting up the survivor, then gently dropping him into a bottomless pit, is a delightful experience that you can get in very few places. That said, it's not a spectacular game. When it came out, I would have recommended it, but playing it again now, all I can think of is how much I wish it were more like Arkham City or Shadow of Mordor. I'm spoiled by fluid combat systems now, and this is very much a hack slashy spammy game with much less thought in it.The story is okay. It works. I'm a big Star Wars nerd, and there's stuff here to like and dislike.Also, this is a pretty shoddy PC port. The settings are limited and you have to change them in a separate launcher, because the in game menu system is a straight copy of the already clunky and limited console version. I've had several random crashes while playing it, but otherwise have had no performance or control issues.			",98,34,1,22,19,2,22

												Fear = AngerAnger = HateHate = SufferingFear = The Path to the Dark SideGotta find myself something to Fear then!!It's a really good story for all SW fans, though i'm only part way through the game. my only complaint is that the controls/combat doesn't seem as fluid as it should be to allow for proper utilization of all the mechanics the game has to offer. it's hard to feel like a hardcore force wielder kicking butt in the middle of a fight when i'm having a hard time getting the character to throw the right item at the right object/enemy. having to stop to aim and fire force held objects takes time that interupts the flow of potentially awesome combat. this all seems fleshed out by the sequal to a much greater extent, though.The camera work is mildly tricky.The voice over work is usually well done.In the end it may seem like i'm not enjoying the game, but i am. i most definitely love the dark side of the force			",276,42,3,67,3,1,28

												TL;DRIt's a good game, but there are quite a few problems with it. Buy it at a reduced cost, if possible.The full review contains MILD SPOILERS. Caution advised.Star Wars: The Force Unleashed was one of my favorite games on my old PS2 when I was younger, and decided to pick this up after feeling a bit nostalgic. This is actually a port of the PS3 / Xbox 360 versions of the game, which disappointed me somewhat, though it's the same game for the most part. (It may just be nostalgia, but I find the PS2 / Wii version better than this version)The Story is good, probably 6.5 stars. It's nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done. Taking place in between Episodes III and IV, you play as Galen Marek, the son of a Jedi, turned Vader's Apprentice at a young age. Now known as Starkiller, your training is almost complete, with the end goal being to help Vader overthrow the Emperor. However,  Vader kills you in front of the Emperor, in order to ""Gain his trust."" After being brought back to life, Starkiller feels a little betrayed, and tries to get revenge. The gameplay is absolutely where the game shines. While it does fall into that same problem that every Star Wars game has, where lightsabers geel way too weak, it's still fun when you don't think about the fact that they're supposed to cut through just about everything. Starkiller is also a master of the Force, however, which is what makes this Beat-em-Up different from other Beat-em-Ups. You can pick things up, throw people and things, shock them, throw your lightsaber, push them, everything you'd expect from a Force prodigy. The boss fights are quite a lot of fun, and regular combat is great hoards of Troopers and Rebels alike. The game suffers from a few major problems, however. The level design is not very good. It asks for some way-too-specific jumps for the game's floaty physics engine, and failing generally results in instant death. Quick Time Events are very frequent, and break up the flow of combat when you fight larger enemies, such as Rancors or AT-ATs. Load times are ridiculous, and far too frequent. Lastly, the game has a 30 FPS cap, though there are fixes for that available on the Internet.(Also the Star Destroyer mission is atrocious. The PS2 / Wii version may be better simply because it's not there.)Overall, I'd probably give the game a 6 / 10. Above average, but not by much. Pick it up on sale, if you can.			",108,17,0,5,5,1,8

A bloody disaster, don't waste your money, buy a real star wars game, like Knights of the Old Republic. Something more fun, and actually works.

												This game is decently good.  If it's on sale, I definitely recommend it.  The historical context is an interesting possible back story for the Rebellion, but the personal romance portion of the plot is not well done.  The graphics are good during combat, not as good during cutscenes.  The walking is awkward, and the cutscenes don't display your customized lightsaber and outfit.  The game is short, but the gameplay still gets repetitive.  Blowing things up with massive force powers is pretty awesome though.  Overall, The Force Unleashed is not as good as games like Jedi Academy, but it's still a fun thing to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars the Force Unleashed is the ultimate Star Wars Game. I'm sure that at some point during a Star Wars game we've all said to ourselves ""Why the ♥♥♥♥ can't I just throw this guy off the edge of a cliff with the force?"", well, now you can ACTUALLY DO THAT.This game lets you use all the force goodies from the movies, plus a couple new ones, such as creating a force shockwave and imbuing your lightsaber with sith lightning.The combat is fast paced and dodge-oriented. You get health for killing any enemy, but be careful; on higher difficulties you can be torn asunder by blaster fire very quickly.From a story standpoint, this is a game that takes place during the ""Dark Times"", the period between episodes III and IV where the last of the jedi were being hunted down, and the Rebel Alliance hadn't been formed. The game takes you through the deaths of most of the remaining jedi, and shows the origins of the Rebel Alliance, as well as Vader's plan to overthrow Emperor Palpatine (supporting his actions in Episode VI).

												Back when this game came out, I only had a Wii, so I got the Wii version because I was stuck with it. In my mind I thought it was fun, though wish I could do some things that were in the PS3 and 360 versions that I couldn't do on the Wii Version. But later on I no longer cared until I heard of the Black Lightsaber. So years later I get it on the PC with DLC included, beat the game and in the end I said words that no one would probably ever say. ""I think the Wii version was better."" Now bare in mind I'm not exactly stating that EVERYTHING in the Wii version was better, but what if I told you that there are missions that could of been done in the Wii Version that wasn't included in other version. And this is before DLC, for example the Jedi Temple, you literally go to the Jedi Temple 3 times during the normal campaign of the Wii version. To know that people had to wait for a DLC release, it's hard to say if it's a good thing if you had to pay for it. You even return to Cloud City twice in the Wii Version. Also another disappointment was knowing you couldn't change the hilt of a lightsaber. Look I know there's always going to be differences between the actual game and ""down-graded"" ports of them. But the ""down-graded"" felt like it received more love, with more levels, more customizations, more costumes, I do believe there are more costumes on the Wii Version, if not now no doubt post DLC. Now I'm not saying this version is BAD, (well on a level with the PC version there are tweeks needed) the game is still fun, I still enjoy it. I'm literally just surprised to know that Force Unleashed on other platforms but Wii (and maybe PS2) was lacking a bit. Now this game is still fun as I said, the story is good, the gameplay is good, levels can be short at times but are worth exploring for unlockables. The only TRUE negatives I have is Raxus Prime imagery and some sound errors which may require online help for fixes. Despite those this is a good game to check out even now.			",73,4,2,5,2,2,2

												This would be a great game. If it wasn't for the horrible camera angle that is locked in for boss fights. YOu go from playing the game from a 3rd person view to a paneramic view of the fight. What a waste. For me at least it was enough of a screw up by the designer to make this game not worth playing, for me at least. Fix this and I am good to go.			",3,0,0,2,2,0,0

												The Force Unleashed is a great game, if a little akward to control at times.  The game really shows how badass jedi/sith can be, and is great for stress relief.  My only two complaints are that (1) the game can be difficult to control in combat (you feel knockback way more than some enemies, and can easily get stun locked at times), and (2) the DLC (included in teh Ultimate Sith Edition) feels very separate from the game itself.  The DLC isn't added into the game itself, to allow you to continue levelling up and such in new missions, but instead are three new options when you start a new game, providing you a pre-levelled character to use.Overall, though, it's a great game, and definitely one I'd recommend to all Star Wars fans.(PS, if my low game time seems suspicious, it's because I put most of my time into this game on my console, and only recently purchased it for Steam)			",483,157,6,67,60,8,98

												there are so many problems with this game its hard to write a positive review.story is ok as long as you can power through the horrid combat system with enemies that make you feel like the shitiest sith the the galaxy. i love star wars and the universe its sad that lucas arts developed this game and many other titles that never really hit the mark. the game and universe have so much to offer without delivery much like going on a long and teadous date with a person that talks a big game but when you hit the bedroom it just ends up being ok, leaving you never really satisfied.A better developer should have done this game.- combat lackluster - story starwars awesome - small bugs through out game needed more Q/A- play if your story driven its the only way you'll finish - if your game play driven and picky like me save yourself the frustration and watch a LP			",29,1,0,5,1,0,5

												Flawed but very playable with an interesting story and concept.  The game's fudgy controls are its biggest bugbear, as you're given a range of awesome force powers but very rarely do get to use them to the badass effect becoming of Sith lord.  Instead you spend the first few levels as an unbeleavable klutz.Nonetheless there's a lot to like about this game, and a tremendous amount of satisfaction to be gained from scything down waves of stormtroopers with your lightsaber.

												Employs artificial difficulty, has repetative gameplay, has unskippable cutscenes that play AFTER your checkpoint forcing you to watch them again and again and again, has the WORST camera I have ever come across for bossfights rendering the fights which are actually pretty easy or rather would be if THE ♥♥♥♥ING CAMERA WOULD LET ME TARGET ANYTHING, has ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t quick time events and is basically a mess of terrible mechanics and bad design ideas. However it is kinda still worth playing, if only for the cutscenes so that the second game (which is actually good) makes sense. Wait, no, youtube is a thing and all the cutscenes are on there. Yeah, skip this game. Go straight to the 2nd.			",139,16,4,31,18,3,29

												I bought this for the May the 4th 2015 sale, and needless to say, it's just like I remember it. Sept the horrifying motion blur. That was pretty bad. I was hoping to play through the game again but that motion blur just messes with the background too hard. I've tried lowering all the settings to no avail. I ended up looking around online and it seems this is a pretty common issue, people say it's because you need a better graphics card and processor but... Mine are pretty up there in quality and alot of others with high end computers have the same issue. Aparently it's very picky about which ones it's compatible with, so look up the specifications list before you buy it.However If you don't have the listed hardware, and you don't mind taking a ride on satan's rollercoster, then by all means buy the game. Knowing me I will, but I wanted to put this information out there before somebody bought it and was incredibly disapointed. May the force be with you... Because with that motion blur? Your pretty much relying on seeing through the force to beat this.I hear the star destroyer scene is a pain because of it.			",65,14,0,15,9,1,13

												Is not KOTOR, but is not a bad game. The camera can become one of your biggest enemies, but you get used to it. The game is fun, the story tries to play your emotional side by recalling some ""things"" from the original movies, but don't expect much on that subject. At times it seems that the writers where fired mid chapter and the new writer had to rush and finish so he could start his chapter. If it's cheap buy it, play it, and forget about it. Just like that hookup at the bar that night...			",60,15,1,11,5,0,17

												To all the people above or below me hating this game, well let me tell you something, this game is beautifully presented, even though the game was originally released on console, it's controls on the PC are is to master, and sure at times in the game you will get stuck but have no fear if you are great at finding ""shortcuts"", or if you are good at finding out problems easily unlike the haters of this then you will have no problem at all with this game, and the combat and movements are fantastic, and if you are wondering yes I have played the console version therefore I know this game, even though I haven't played this game for a couple of years I easily remastered it and soared right through it with no problems at all, so in summary: If you want a beautifully presented game great movement and combat then get this game I highly recommend it, this was the best use of my left over money.10/10 would definitely play this game again and again and again, etc.P.S. When you get at a part of the game where you have to double jump and then force dash then just put your left pinky finger on the shift key, your left middle finger on the W key, and your left thumb on the Spacebar, it worked for me, also to the guy who said at the beginning of the game Darth Vader moves like a glacier, please next time read the controls before starting cause you can move faster with the shift key to force dash to move faster, there's another tip for you!

												I really like this game, there is so much in it. You can choose from many ""costumes"" - play as a Luck Skywalker, Stormtrooper, or Qui-Gon Jinn. Levels are sworming with low-lifes just waiting to feel the power of the Dark Side. There is bonus for almost everything. You can grab some crate, or enemy and throw them in front of each other; you can use lightsaber combo with lightning in it, and finish it wiht force push, just to grab your pray and crush it into the ground. Some of the ""world"" parts are aslo avaible to grab and throw. Sometimes you have to bend objects with your power which is very cool. You can also use lightning to enable some devices. I like the way the ""secrets"" modify gameplay. If you find that special place, you also obtain holocrons. You can use them to modify your lighsaber, your force powers, combo technics or general skills. In this version there are also 3 new scenarios (with new costumes). The Hoth, Jedi Temple and Tatooine. Jedi Temple is beyond my skill right now, I'd get killed every single time after 2 min. They all are ok and fun to play. There is also database - you can read about all equipment and objects used in the game. If you like star wars because of details, you'll find them. Models are done with great detail. My favorite for now is Darth Sion. I was very suprised when I've found out that you can choose dark lighsaber colour. It's almost like ancient saber used by leader of Death Watch. Game should be played with controler such as Xbox 360 for example. There is only sigle player mode, and autosave after checkpoints. May the Force be with you :) ",85,13,10,14,4,1,9

												While my initial impression was vastly negative due to too many technical annoyances:- Bugs and crashes- Save system is a joke- 30fps cap- Very minimal customization in the game options- Highly unoptimized for the PCI can't say I didn't enjoy the game at all as a SW fan. Environments are varied with good amount of detail. Enemies are quite tough and can be frustrating. The game can also get very dull at times, but they do offer some character customization. The big selling point the story itself is pretty mediocre for the most part. Despite the flaws I still feel that any Jedi Knight fan can have fun experience on most part if being aware of the shortcomings beforehand.BEGINNER TIPS:- Play with gamepad- Apply the 60fps fix- Don't play on hard with 1st playthrough- Don't forget to apply a power crystal like I did.

												Don't get me wrong, I love this game. You get a feeling of real power as you run around smashing wookies into walls, slashing your way through ranks of terrified stormtroopers and electrocuitng the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of some poor rodian who happened to be wandering around the area you landed in. The  customisation with lightsaber and outfits is a nice touch though i found myself going with the default costume for the majority of my playthrough.The story line is simple yet compelling, and isa  fine addition to the star wars universe as it explains the origins of some major factions... HOWEVERIt is also one of the buggiest pieces of crap I've ever bought- you dash into a wall and get stuck clipped halfway through, some enemies are literally unkillable for some reason and have to just be left behind if theres no bottomless pit to chuck them into. Like many people I have talked with anything in the near or middle distance doesnt render properly and leaves a horrible lagging effect of my character and the fixed background (even with my juicy computer)- I ignored this ad decided to play anywa, untill i reached a certain leve which required you to interact witth something very far away- which i could not do as i had literally no idea which way it was pointing so i could line it up with a bizarre arbitrary direction. This also ties in with a questionable control scheme, as a console port the controls are never going to be stellr but these go beyond anything I've seen in a while- and I play Assassins Creed on PC!Overall, I'd recommed this game on one condition-its not the pc version. Hell, get the PS2 version i first played this game on, it's better than this sloppy port..			",59,5,0,11,11,0,6

Star Wars The Force Unleashed™ Disclaimer : Bought this ON SALE! for 2,99 EU So keep that in mind when reading this review,And have not watched any of the movies (Spoiler)Okey , where to start. This game is quite fun , it has not to many mechanics so far (2-3 Hours) And the game starts abit wierd , you start out as being Vader, Who wouldn't like that?But anyway , The game starts you out with no tutorial, nothing at all baiscly , so first level you just gonna spend your time killing stuff and walk very slow...damn i hate that part.______________________________________________________Okay here is where the game start itselfStory : The story is about wiping out all Jedi (of what i played thats whats the story has comed to).And I really like the story, not going to say anymore, dont really wanna spoil the game for you._______________________________________________________Fighting System: Its a free flow fighting system with a lightsaber. its quite fun but at the starts its quite the sameNothing much you can do in combos.You level up your Jedi with 3 different pointForce PowersForce CombosForce TalentsThis Force powers can make you push you enemies away,Throw lightsaber,and very nice attacks.Really love it!And the boss fights! Holy! i Fing love them, they have some mechanics i love, BUT one thing ppl might not like is ""Q-T-E"" is on bosses.In my opinion its fine and makes the game shine!there is so much i wanna say but i wont cuz you need to play the fights to understand! Review might get updated after i finished the gamefor the 3 eu price YES! ",329,72,5,46,48,4,24

												So very much sub-par, it borders on insult.While unleashing the force is fun, it is also quite ridiculous and in stark contrast to the subtleness of the movies.Camera controls are a severe hindrance to prioritising targets and using the force precisely. Many a time I found myself cursing the screen, because I got stunlocked from a dead angle.The story does hook you at the start, but turns rather bonkers.Characters are decent enough, but their relationships are so comically told, it´s hard to bother.If you wanna play a good star wars action game, go get Republic Commando. Or the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series.Don´t bother with this one.Although, Wookie genocide is indeed fun.			",139,11,3,9,8,0,22

The ps2 version had a way better lvling system by using points, the levels were way more fun. What happend to the robot scrap yard??? robot knights? what the hell happend to those scavaging robots crawling out of between the junk and had robot like arms. The enormus titan bots that would crush you. The movement sucks too. I realy loved this game on my ps2. Still that doesnt make this a bad game.Iam just confused, why is this so differend?

												First off, this game is capped at 30FPS. Second off, certain levels are without sound and require you to mod the game to experience them WITH sound, which should've been fixed a day after release.I'm also going to need to comment on the gameplay. To me, it feels like a confused Hack N' Slash, which does nothing for the STUPID enemy designs, some of them are immune to force powers, and some are just really bulky, don't respond to your attacks, then grab you. Again, STUPID DESIGN DECISION. There are also areas where the story loses itself. If you waste money on this game, when you could get Bayonetta, or a better star wars game, you will know what I mean.			",176,18,3,16,17,2,9

												This is one of those games that you know isn't good, but you love it anyway. It's crashed on me plenty of times, the framerate tanks in strange places, it's locked at 30 frames, the sounds are pretty bad, the story's disorganized, some of the player models are really strange looking (Juno Eclipse, mainly), quick time events, plenty of bugs, the settings are in a startup menu, wonky controls, and plenty more.Even through all of this, this is still one of my favorite games. Ever. I have never played a Star Wars game that better captures the feel of the Force. Flinging your enemies across the room, throwing explosives at them, holding them in the air as you repeatedly toss your lightsaber into them, electrocuting people, throwing boxes at TIE Fighters and blowing them up. Even the basic lighsaber combat is fun, bouncing between enemies. Tie the two togeter, and you get a combat system that looks and feels fantastic. It feels great to find new ways to absolutely demolish your enemies. I don't even slightly feel bad for paying the full $20 for this game. It's so much silly fun, you feel like a true Sith.Buy this game, and experience the true power of the Dark Side. ",182,19,2,15,13,0,10

												This game has an amazing combat system, but the action is constantly interupted by quicktime events every boss or big enemy you fight. This breaks the flow of the game entirley too often which is upsetting since the rest of the combat is so good combo wise.         The controls feel ok sometimes, but a lot of the time you don't feel in control of the character. You push buttons, and he does whatever, but it feels very synthetic and loose.           The camera and targetting system is hard to control. The enemy AI is absolute garbage, the enemies aren't hard, once you find out there weaknesses you can just spam till it dies, which is upsetting because the combo system is awesome and really satisfying, also the storm troopers are pathetic as they shoot at you till you get close enough to cut through them like a piece of paper. The games crappy AI turns the whole thing into trial and error, get killed by a bunch of enemies, learn how to beat them after 5-10 tries, rinse and repeat for the whole game. Not very compelling.           The port isn't good either, This game runs on a constant 30fps and no way to bring up. But the most annoying thing is the frequent crashes.            Pretty disapointing because I really wanted to like this game, but I found it waaay over hyped and non-compelling. For a person wanting a decent hack n slash, play this game.            Die hard Star Wars fans wanting a compelling, challenging masterpiece that controls like butter and has satisfying gameplay overall, this game is not for you.			",71,8,0,7,3,0,0

												First I would like to say that this is a great game, it had some potential to go into bigger and better things, the ideas presented in the story and direct correlation to the cinematic universe before Disney declared this non-canon was fantastic.However, the ideas they present for the story I feel are just scratching the surface, I saw potential for further development between character relations and the development of the main character himself, world exploration, a bit more intricacy in combat similar to that of Jedi academy to add a layer of strategy when approaching a foe or boss, rather than just the hack and slash/force *insert technique* anything in your way. I understand it is meant to  be reflective of Starkiller's raw power and while some of the quick time mini-games result in some excellent finishers, there could have been so much more.The game does go through some backstory however it is only if you are willing to read through their character profiles but the vibesand expectations you get off reading them just don't seem to show through the gameplay, take Juno for example, her backstory involved her joining the empire to finally gain some love from her cold-distant jerk of a father, however non of that contempt shows in the story not so much depth and when  Starkiller and Juno kiss I can't help but feel nothing towards it at all because between missions there is very little interaction between the two or anything will lead up to it IMO. Same with Proxy, your friendly neighbourhood training droid bent on killing you that you keep as your companion, so much more could be done with that.Replayability is worth tackling at more difficult levels but you are more likely to go through it again just to find those elusive saber crystals, the black saber crystal is awesome beeteedubs, but as of yet even though I have not fully leveled nor collected everything I just can't bring it to myself to revisit the levels again.Don't get me wrong some of the levels are interesting but then you have to revisit some of them again  and even though you get to  go through the stomach of a SARLAC there's just some wasted oppotunity to explore the then extensive world Star wars, I feel anyway.Overall I am a little underwhelmed by this game not worth it's price since I finished the story easily w ait for a sale if you wish to buy it.

												Here's my grain of salt:It's a fun game. It's very good. However, if you're having the mentality of ""The best Star Wars game"" then you'd be wrong. Nothing's perfect.If you want the best Star Wars game (in my opinion) then buy Star Wars: Jedi Knight II (or Jedi Academy). Chances are, this is the game you want. But don't expect too much of it. It's very pleasing and surely a fun game to play!			",72,11,0,6,1,0,5

(Mini-guide: Ignore the onscreen instructions and just make the ship level with the ground and directly pointed at you, wait until the tie-fighters get you to low health before letting go)Zero replayability.

												A great part of the Star Wars extended univserse, The Force Unleashed is between the prequel and original trilogies. You play as Darth Vader's apprentice, Starkiller (yes, like from The Force Awakens) and are part of the Dark Side for a period of time before things change and you become aware of your past.This game is not a great port, and could have used more work but is definitely a very fun game. It gets a lot more hate than it deserves and I do not understand why. I love the original Star Wars trilogy and think this game does the Star Wars universe more justice than most extended universe material out there, aside from Marvel Comics, Republic Commando, and Knights of the Old Republic. As an action game, it's a solid title, and as a Star Wars game, it's a must play for any fan, and the physics are an absolute blast to play with.And with the two endings (Light & Dark side), there's plenty reason to come back for more.+ Great action+ Interesting story+ Great for Star Wars extended universe+ New and old characters+ Sam Witwer+ Collectables, including lightsaber color crystals+ All the extra costumes+ Story DLC for if you get the Sith ending+ Havok and Euphoria physics+ Using Force powers is feels more... powerful than ever before+ Familiar Star Wars locations+ Great soundtrack and ambience+ Sound effects from the Star Wars film franchise+ Varying enemy models...- ... that all operate in the same way- Very glitchy- Not many graphics options- A very rough port that didn't have enough work done on it- No DLC for light side ending- Changing costumes takes you to previous checkpoint			",422,26,5,57,7,2,20

												Now is the game perfect? Hell no. The controls are difficult to handle and the gameplay is eratic. Sometimes enemies will continually hit you with no chance of you getting back up. Really, this is a console game, even with controller, it's still difficult to handle. But once you get combat down (which is a chore) you will feel like a badass. This game not only looks great, but if you are a star wars fan (and hate Disney for ret-conning EU) than this game's story will satisfy, even if you aren't, it is pretty well written, voice actors clearly know what they're doing, and overall it fits nicely in the Star Wars universe. Reccomend if you have a controller, if not, it's still worth a go. And for the price, it isn't asking for much, especially with the various other DLC campaigns.EDIT:This game is probably one of the most recent and best examples of star wars combat, except for one major MAJOR flaw... The lock-on mechanic. You know how in the Batman Arkham games whenever you threw a punch, Batma would automatically hit a nearby enemy? It's said that Arkham Asylum came out the same year as this game, and if this game somehow managed to incorporate that one little addition of code. That made it so that not every bad♥♥♥♥♥move you made completely missed an enemy, but immediately locked onto an enemy? This game would have very little issues and be out-right perfect in my mind. But it's not, and that's a shame.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want to break a controller then this is a good way to do it. There are many redeeming qualities in this game and they make it worth the money and time. Just... Just bear in mind that there are a lot of problems with the main campaign. Glitches, clunky controls, broken mini bosses, and one of the most unforgiving ""extra hard"" modes you'll ever find are the most prominent issues you'll find. The mechanics, however, are very satisfying and you do feel challenged while maintining the sense of power that should come with being a Sith assassin. What's more he DLC levels remove basically all the frustrating elements (aside from DLC being better than the main game). Be you a casual player, an rpg completionist, or a star wars fan; this game is worth your time and money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game offers a backstory from the original trilogy how the rebel alliance was forged. The pc port isn't the best though it's deffinetely better on console. But the actual game is so much fun and i recommend it to all the star wars fans out there!			",50,4,0,4,3,0,2

												One of the best Star Wars games ever! I am one of the biggest fans of star wars and this game is one of the reasons i love it so much! Besides all of the awesomeness of lightning and using the force to control your enemies this game has skins from the movies! That's like scratching an itch I didn't even know i had! It has everything a star wars fan wants. So if you like Star Was or just Good Games buy this. Look no farther.			",19,2,0,5,3,0,1

												I do not recommended this game.I started to play to kill a few hours. I was expecting an action-driven game that pushes me towards to complete it. I ended up being bored as hell after less than an hour. The game failed to summon the SW atmosphere, what I really love. The only moments when I wasn't bored were the ones when I laughed on the lame opponents, lack of creativity, bad camera-handling, texture glitches, etc. The controls are horrible. I have played it with my one-month old wired Xbox 360 controller, which works very well with other games. Here, it was like a nigthmare.I was told that the story is pretty good, so I decided to go on. Even in the shadow of the fact that an interesting story can be ruined, when it is told by a boring guy. Approx. half an hour later, the game crashed. I think it was a sign sent by the Force to not to torture myself any longer looking for the atmosphere of SW in this pile of rubbish.

												Force moving things aren't very good with the mouse. You end up throwing something in completely the wrong direction due to some sort of aim assist. You also have to lift up the mouse a lot when doing puzzles that require moving something with the force. The gimmick gets old after the first time you do it and would be better off if you only had to hold the button down.Boss battles against Jedi/Sith are grindy. Forcing you to unbalance the enemy, then spam damage while he's down. Repeat about 20 times till you get to a quicktime event. There's also a quicktime event where you hold down some buttons for 10 minutes to ""force pull"" something, with breaks that you have to force throw things to kill them. Remember how force throwing is a pain to use? You could also try to throw the enemies into each other, except you can't reach them unless they're right on top of you. Nevermind the fact that you are trying to force pull something miles away the entire time.There is a freaking LOADING SCREEN to enter any submenu. Want to upgrade your powers? LOADING SCREEN. And the menues ignore the mouse cursor like a typical console port.[Spoilers ahead]......The ending was lame. Typical ""if you kill the emperor, you can't be a Jedi"" plot armor BS.

												This game is the best lightsaber wielding game out there. You play the role of Darth Vader’s secret apprentice on his mission to hunt down and kill the remaining Jedi. The gameplay and the words are awesome. I had originally played this game on the PS3 and it is everything I wanted in a Jedi/Sith video game.8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Greatest game EVER! OK, I played this game on my Xbox 360 as a kid when it first came out, I've completed it on every difficulty (except the the hardest one you unlock after completing the game once - the Emporer/Darth Vader are rediculously hard). But now that I have the ULTIMATE SITH ADDITION, I get access to so many new skins/costumes, multiple extra levels and more. I've also just discovered so many new combos since I was too young to really remember them when I first played it.The combat is so fun because there's so many awesome moves you can do - you really feel like a sith (alough you can't do the Force choke). The level design puts you right into the Star Wars universe on multiple planets from the movies (and new ones) with a good selection of enemies including one's you've seen and one's you haven't. It is set after order 66 and before episode IV which means you get to see characters from both the prequels and the original films. You get to see the remenants of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. The story and cinematic cutscenes mixed in with brillilant John Williams original Star Wars themes and the awesome new Force Uleashes theme makes the game feel as if it is a new movie. And the story has a few twists and turns to keep you intruiged and alert. The levels are quite long and gameplay can get repetitive but for me, because of the vast array of abilties, every time I pkay I discover something new. There's also two ending to the game which adds to relay value, Jedi Holocrons to collect in each mission (and other secondary objectives to complete), not forgetting this Sith Editions' extra missions which I have yet to play. You can customise the colour and crystal type and upgrade unlocking new combos. There s only 10 missions in the main game (the first of which you play as Darth Vader but cannot replay for some reason) but they all take time and have a difficult boss at the end.Overall, may not be for everyone but definitely for Star War fans and action gamers alike. Also, there's some pretty hardcore gampley in here as wel, especially when you fight the bosses!			",37,1,0,7,0,0,4

												Star Wars: The Force Uleashed is a fairly average 3rd person hack and slash set in the Star Wars universe. The story is, while a bit bland, fairly good overall and goes in-depth into the events between the 3rd and 4th movies in the Star Wars franchise. The game features a set of force powers and effects the make the player feel like a powerful badass apprentice to Darth Vader - flinging stormtroopers out of ship windows, shocking them with lightning, and slicing/skewering them with your lightsaber all work to support this feeling. But this is where the game stops being good, at least on the PC port.      The default controls for the PC are clunky at best, making the ""god of war style"" combo system this game touts difficult to pull off at times. The flaws in the controls are made even worse in instances where precision is needed - precision that makes the difference between beating a level and yelling at your scream in frustration as moves that you would like to pull either dont go off or miss your intended target entirely (leaving you open to a brutal counter-attack as well).  This is particlarly evident in the boss battles (take your pick which one). The game stops being a behind the shoulder 3rd person beat em' up and jarringly shifts to a 3D isometric ""Mortal Combat Style"" fight, where you cant gain an advantage or effectively perfom combos becuase you're not really sure where exactly you're hitting (and even if you do hit, the bosses have a very annoying habit of countering or blocking everything you do). In one particular level you are supposed to bring down a star destroyer from space and crash it into the planet you're on. This task is borderline impossible due to the horrible controls and lack of  any precision aiming available to you.     The poor optimization is also evident in the jarring loading screens randomly placed in levels, and before and after the ""high quality"" cinematic scenes. Poor audio syncing also results in the cinematics being a pain to both watch and listen to. Sometime in the beginning of a level you will see yourself standing at the starting point for a few moments, at which point the screen goes blank and THEN the beginning in-game level animation will go off. Also, the music and sound effects for the game tend to cut out at random moments (even during 3D cinematics) and will not return unless you restart the game entirely.     Overall I only recommend this game if you're a Star Wars fan, and even then I'm not sure I can say its a good recommendation. 4/10			",87,22,0,30,17,4,33

												Force Unleashed is the Jedi power fantasy we've all dreamt of at one point. While that may sound appealing to some, the game is mired by it's subpar controls, ridiculous story, and camera which too often hinders depth perception during already tiresome boss encounters.If you're a fan of beat-em-ups and don't care too much for the plot, I'd recommend picking it up during a sale. Otherwise you're not missing anything by passing this title up.			",215,44,0,19,10,3,18

												So this is not a 100% reccomended title, simply for some issues with it bieng older.So, by far this is one of the best Starwars games out there. Decent lightsaber combat along with using storm troopers as a human shield then using him to knock down his friends. The quicktime event are pretty decent also, even though I suck at them. Aside from the combat mechanics, the story (so far for me) is pretty good.But it is a older game soooo, it has some issues. Namily the fact that unless you have a Xbox controller is it impossible to get past the first Star Destoyer pull down minigame, as you only get the correct speed for pulling it down for a short time before the mouse suppot kinda gives out, and you only get about 1/4 the pull down speed. Now this wouldnt be so bad if TIE fighters didn't continuly spawn and would reach you before you could rip the Star Destoyer out of the sky. Can rip Star Destroyers out of orbit, cant throw purge troopers or small walkers. Will update once I get my hands on a Xbox controller.			",63,6,0,6,9,0,7

												Clunky camera issues aside the force unleashed is a pretty fun action game. Fans of star wars will of course get more from the game as non fans as the story is quite interesting from a lore perspective. The force powers are mostly well designed and enemy variety is sufficient enough to ensure challenges remain throughout. I found the puzzle elements somewhat lacking and often took me away from the action for too long. Still worth a dabble especially if you are a star wars fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game! Great story, voice acting and, of course, gameplay! (And I'm not just saying that because I'm a Star Wars nerd...) I love how STarkiller is portrayed throughout the game, and how is is a metaphor for how there is always good in you, no matter how badly you've been brought up, or how ""sith"" you perceive yourself to be. The hours of fun, exciting and exhilarating gameplay are great to fans of the franchise hardcore and not. I reccomendd this game to everyone as it is awesome!Because the game is a standalone (unless you're counting TFU2) , you don't really need any prior knowledge to get what the story is (probably because the characters of Darth Vader, The Emperor, Princess Leia and such are so rooted into the pop-culture of today).This game is a welcome attribution to any gamer, Star Wars fan or not!!!

												Here's my grain of salt:It's a fun game. It's very good. However, if you're having the mentality of ""The best Star Wars game"" then you'd be wrong. Nothing's perfect.If you want the best Star Wars game (in my opinion) then buy Star Wars: Jedi Knight II (or Jedi Academy). Chances are, this is the game you want. But don't expect too much of it. It's very pleasing and surely a fun game to play!			",72,11,0,6,1,0,5
