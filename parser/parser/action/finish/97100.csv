												Edit: part of this review was made irrelevant by Steam's updated refund policy.DLC will no longer download, I assume due to Timegate no longer existing. Online play is also obviously non-functional. Given Steam's no-refund policy, I think it only fair to include a disclaimer detailing these issues on the game's page in the store.			",32,1,0,6,3,0,1

												This is one of the most underplayed, disrespected games out there. Amazing gameplay, good campaign (Reasonably generic, but introduces you well to the concept of the game) and well... YOU SPAWN IN FROM ♥♥♥♥ING ORBIT. I've clocked everything on this game and I'm in the top one hundred in the world, but that not saying much because only about 26000 people sit on the leaderboard, and no one plays anymore. ♥♥♥♥ing great game... just wish people would play again to revive the multiplayer.

												I'll be honest. The multiplayer is dead unless you find a dedicated clan or group. But other than that, this is a really amazing sequel (read: amazing sequel) that not only adds to the content, but also to the gameplay, and improves upon the rough edges that the origional Section 8 (which is btw also very amazing) had.First, the content. You will notice quickly that alongside your standard weapons, you have modules that improve certain aspects of your armor suit. Want to be able to absorb large amounts of damage and dish out even more? You can improve the damage per shot that your weapons do, as well as improve your shields an armor to more than double your standard infantryman has. Want to be that classic sniper? You can do that too. You can make a custom loadout for almost any situation. Anti-infantry, anti-armor, anti-turret, and so on. I only wish that you had a way of attacking enemies that are ""burning in"" so to speak.The gameplay is astounding. Section 8 asked the question, ""What is players could spawn anywhere on the battlefield?"" They answered that question by letting you ""burn in"" from your dropship onto any point on the battlefield. However, the enemy can deploy stationary AA guns that only serve to shoot you out of the sky (and they do that very well, I can tell you that). You also use this burning in tactically, by striking directly into the enemy base or (I kid you not) right on top of an enemy soldier.Now, the origional Section 8 had some balancing issues, such as a Machine Gun being more effective than an Assault Rifle at everything except accuracy past 50m. Now, in Prejudice, the Assault Rifle reigns supreme at quick skirmishes between soldiers, while the MG has been altered to a much more supportive and long-lasting state.Since the maps are fairly large, every soldier has the ability to ""overdrive"" which lets them run like there's a grizzly on their♥♥♥♥♥ You can use this overdrive ability tactically too, by ramming into enemy soldiers or using the extra speed to make your jetpack that much more effective.Another interesting thing Section 8 does is let soldiers call down deployables such as MG guns, RPG launchers, scanners, and more, which allow a group of soldiers to make a small outpost complete with defenses, scanners, AA turrets, and of course depots that repair them all. Trust me, it's not fun to have rockets and bullets raining down on you with no end (until you die).Haha wow I just realized how much I had rambled on XDSo I guess in short,This game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, and very underrated. Buy this. Get your friends to buy it. Revive the multiplayer.			",133,26,3,8,36,0,35

												Unfortunetly Section 8's community has become very small meaning it is very hard to find a multiplayer game.This game has great graphics, a larege amount of different weapons, vehicles, armor and maps. One of the things that stands out to me on this game is the respawn system, where you DROP OUT OF THE SKY! Especially at the beginning of the game seeing many falling troops coming down. This game is great with friends! I highlty recommend this game!			",118,6,2,7,8,1,5

-Quick Review-Section 8: Prejudice is a Sci-fi First-person shooter developed by TimeGate Studios and released in 2011. Section 8: Prejudice implements different characteristics to break up the monotony of standard First-person shooter competitive multiplayer gameplay.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Section 8: Prejudice takes place after it's predecessor “Section 8” (released: 2009). Alex Corde, (the protagonist) is reviewing basic training and learning how to use the various weapons and tools with the 8th Armored Infantry.Suddenly the 8th Armored Infantry is threatened and the United States Empire (Symbolism much?) goes to war again with a group known as the “Arm of Orion”. The basic gist of the rest of the game is: completing various objectives on different planets and trying to track down the leader of the Arm of Orion.Gameplay: Section 8: Prejudice had many unique qualities making it a great game competitive multiplayer First-person shooter, unfortunately there aren't very many people playing it anymore, so multiplier has mostly dried up.Rather then focus on the qualities that Section 8: Prejudice shares with mostly all First-person shooters (usual classes, usual weapons, usual game modes), some different qualities are:When you spawn, you drop through the atmosphere from drop ships above the map, you can select where to spawn, unless someone has placed an Anti-Air Turret …then you'll probably die from Anti-Air Fire unless you're extremely well armored.The classes are completely customization, with different armor skins, various weapons, stats, and armor boosts. (That is a bit common in this genre, but shhh! it's still worth note.)You can purchase vehicles, turrets, sensors and supply depots by using “Requisition points” that you earn from accomplishing various tasks, challenges, and kills.One final tool to mention, and also my personal favorite the “repair tool”, you can use this tool to repair your armor, your vehicles, your turrets, just about anything with a health bar. You can also set it up so that you siphon health from enemies.Achievements: There are no Steam achievements for Section 8: Prejudice, however you do unlock Xbox achievements.…Yeah logging in gets a bit tricky since you need to download a Microsoft program and create an account if you don't already have an Xbox account.There are 59 achievements with a total of 1250 points, the DLC: Overdrive Map Pack also has 9 achievements. (DON'T BUY ANY DLC, I'LL EXPLAIN LATER)These achievements require a pretty good team of people to accomplish “Win a game on each map in swarm on Hard or Insane difficulty”. About half of these achievements are easily obtainable, a fourth are hard earned, and the last fourth require intense grinding and team work.Price: Section 8: Prejudice is priced at $9.99 on it's own, it's a pretty solid title and you can easily spend 10 hours in the game working on the campaign and offline achievements.I do not own any of the DLC, but just to warn people ahead of time, the DLC does not work for this game, so don't purchase any DLC.References: http://steamcommunity.com/app/97100/discussions/0/828937979268383691/http://steamcommunity.com/app/97100/discussions/0/558750624694862546/Conclusion: Story: worthy of at least one play through. Gameplay: A nice change of pace from your standard First-person shooter styles. Customization, different game modes, classes, weapons, and repair tool all make Section 8: Prejudice enjoyable. Achievements: none on steam, but you can scratch that itch via Xbox achievements. Price: perfect for the game, however it doesn't hurt to wait for a sale.I recommend Section 8: Prejudice to people who enjoy First-person shooters, and Sci-fi themes. Brace yourself for very little multiplayer activity, there are still people who love this game, and you might be able to start or join a group to schedule game days, but all in all you'll probably be playing mostly by yourself.

												Section 8: Prejudice is a surprisingly decent, if not painfully short, FPS. The main campaign will probably only run you about 3-4 hours or so, with a decent amount of that time stuck in loading screens.It feels like an attempt to replicate the feel of the Halo franchise in a way, by making your characters kind of ""floaty"", as well as everything having a general ""Halo""-like feel to it, from the character design to the weapons. The story, however, is rather lackluster, and doesn't really have any memorable moments to it at all. Something about aliens, or a rebel task force... or... Something. Nothing really sticks with you. The cut scenes really don't add any substance to the game at all.Graphically, the game actually looks really nice. Nothing amazing, but definitely on par with what I would expect from something that's trying very hard to replicate the look and feel of Halo. The environments are polished all the characters look really amazing. I'd have to say that one of the biggest flaws this game suffers from is that it's using Games for Windows Live, which poses a huge detriment to actually enjoying the game. I made the mistake of forgetting what account I used to register the game with initially, and now I can never fully enjoy the game again, as GFWL does not let you access many features of the game without being logged in, nor does it let you save your Campaign Mode progress. So if you ever forget your GFWL password, you'll never be able to just jump back into the game; you'll have to play it from start to finish in one run.The multiplayer is decent, for what it's worth, though I had difficulty finding anybody to actually play with. The actual gameplay in the multiplayer mode was okay. Nothing I'd ever look back on and say ""Boy, I want to do that again!"", but it wasn't bad, either. Just like the rest of the game, it was just ""okay"".I'd say if you want to play a decent sci-fi FPS, it wouldn't hurt to pick up this game. Just don't expect this to be game-changing or anything.

												Love this game, For now the Multiplayer is dead, and this game is 99.9% based on multiplayer. the 0.01% is a story mode that basically serves as a long ""how to"". BUT your in luck the game is still 100% playable, it has offline modes for all maps and game modes with as many bots as your computer can handle. you just need to find the right .ini file and change the max settings for bots. its a faily simple process that i was surprised i couldn't find online, maybe wasn't looking in the right place. oh well. anyways its a good game with a good offline mode! but be warned the online is pretty dead at this time of the review and also a BIG side note i downloaded the DLC but the GFWL wont install it for some reason... I have yet to be able to play my DLC i purchased which is irratating, but the game is still fully playable8/10			",221,7,4,12,7,0,4

												 Pros:+Decent bots and offline play+Interesting gameplay additions+Mach 5 goomba stomping+Large maps+good overall gameplayCons:-Vehicles are overpowered-Games for windows live (unable to save loadouts and preferences without login)-story is nothing specialLonger review belowVVVVVVVVVVVVVVI have not managed to play a single game of multiplayer due to GFWL:s shutdown, because of this, i will only review the singleplater/Offline with bots.Section 8: prejudice is a first person shooter built mainly with multiplayer in mind. The campaign is short and buggy, and while the story is not the best i have seen, it´s not the worst i have seen either.Where this game really shines however is it´s gameplay. You have reloading shields similiar to HALO, and several different weapons to choose from. you are free (more or less) to change your loadout completely, and creating custom classes. You have two weapon slots, one knife slot and one equipment slot. you can change ammo types, with some ammo types being better against shields, some against unshielded targets, and some slowing your enemy, among other things.when you die in multiplayer, you get an Almost free choice of where to ""spawn"", i say almost, because you do not Spawn per say, rather, you are dropped from a dropship, and the enemy can set up AA-turrets to limit where you can drop.if you manage to hit someone square on the head as you drop, they will ascend to a higher plain of existence, becoming one with the dirt/concrete/Metal floor. If you run for long enough, you will be able to perform a ""sprint"". where this sprint differs from other games, is that you become less of a tactical sprinter, and more of a Charging tank.Due to the wide variety of fast moving targets, you have also been equipped with Auto-aim, that you can toggle on for a few seconds.All these things, and more, make for a fun and challenging experience. You can play tactically, denying drop zones for the enemy while disabling enemy AA, or you can mess about, running at mach speed and executing any poor fool that stands in your way, while giggling like a girl. The bots are not too bad, but they do sometimes do stupid things.In conclusion, this game is A good game. whenever i feel bored, i like to jump into a quick (or hour long) game with bots, and just generally mess about. This game is not for those who look for a good plot, but the gameplay more than makes up for it.			",168,5,3,8,16,2,24

												It's entertaining, fun and enjoyable. Section 8: Prejudice is a sequel to Section 8 and honestly, not much is different. The graphics are a tad better and there is more features, but it still feels like the first game, which is not a bad thing. Both are very pleasant to play and provide a lot to do. Prejudice has a 5 hour single-player, which is pretty average now-a-days, but it's multiplayer provides many more hours of boisterous gameplay.  You can make 7 classes for plenty styles of play, all matches last a long time, not just TDM or CTF and you can call in a lot of support items such as hover bikes, mech suits, and artillery. GFWL could provide some issues, but so far it has not been a problem for me. Overall Section 8: Prejudice is fun. Sort of generic, but that's not entirely a bad thing. You'll have fun with it.

												A brilliant Sci-Fi shooter that was under apreciated by the community which led to them missing out on it's fastpaced Fps feel whilst blending in great noveltys like skydiving in on spawn and having mechs and tanks delivered to you on the battle feild !!!!! However the short and easy storymode left alot to be desired and with so few playing it online ull mostlikly be playing with bots			",326,46,28,31,48,3,52

												If you are looking for a decent FPS time waster to play offline against bots (which is what I was looking for), this is a good option to consider.  Bot difficulty is adjustable and they are very capable enemies to play against.  Online modes and campaign modes will not work right due to Games for Windows Live issues.  So if you are comfortable playing by yourself against bots, give it a try.			",29,7,0,2,1,0,1

												High paced, action filled FPS that keeps you in the thick of it at all times.HIGHLY RECOMMEND for gamers that enjoy a challenge with games set to the hardest diffuculty.Different weapon loadouts and customisation made the game highly diverse, i could play as a longe range assassin or go stealthy with close range capabilities, heavy weapons grenadier to meduim range assault skirmisher.Loved the game although the campaign isnt that long, it is very fun and above all enjoyable no matter how many times you die.

												I recieved this game from a friend that did not know that Games for Windows Live had shut down. You can no longer play this game online. The single player campaign is decent, but nothing revolutionary that hasn't been done before in a sci-fi shooter. The fact that this is still being sold as a four-pack on Steam is truly a disappointment and a scam. The price of this game is also way to high for a game that is no longer supported. If you are buying this after 2013, do yourself a favor and don't. My friend was never able to log into windows live to register his game, but at least I was able to get in and play the campaign mode. Since I was actually able to successfully get this game onto my computer, I have enjoyed playing the campaign mode, but had I bought this game for myself, I would have been frustrated by the fact that a game with an emphasis on multiplayer is still being sold when said multiplayer no longer exists.

												I find that the use of brand new technology, such as the aspect of having to enter your product key every time, adds an important depth to the title and helps the player to build up an emotional attachment to Games for Windows Live. Speaking of GFWL, I find that the enforced use of it to play multiplayer is much improved over the reliable, easy to use and aesthetically pleasing existing interface of Steam really does improve my experience and definitely doesn't make me lose all motivation to even attempt to play the game. In addition to all the points I made above, I find that the use of the generic fps-set-in-the-future campaign really engages the player.11/10 would bang.			",127,17,7,7,14,0,17

												Let me tell you, as a person whos played and loved this game on both Xbox and Playstation, this game is probably one of my favourite FPS games I've ever played. You do however have to jump through a considerable amount of hoops to get Games for Windows Live to work with it, which is essential, as half the content in the game is locked without it. GFWL is form of DRM, and a particuarly nasty one at that. If you decide to purchase the two map packs and the additional blitz pack, you will have to do some additional hoop jumping to get any of those to work, aswell. Luckily there are several step-by-step community guides that will help you through activating both GFWL and the DLC packs for the game.Unfortunately, it seems that that is where the community support for this game ends, as the servers are all but dead, and Timegate studios no longer exists. So don't go into this game expecting an online multiplayer experience, because you are bound to be disappointed.This game does have multiplayer bots, supporting up to 32-player matchs, and several game modes, such as conquest, swarm, and assault. The bots are competent, and you can change their difficulty level to whatever suits your skill level. There's also a singleplayer campaign, about 5 hours in length, featuring lackluster voice acting and story-telling, but it does serve as a good tutorial for the multiplayer. The multiplayer is primarily team-based, and is focused mostly on Dynamic Combat Missions, or DCMs, which are alternate objectives that pop up sporadically throughout a match that range from escort missions to infiltration missions to recovery missions, each of which serve to generate constant fast paced combat, and have the potential to turn the tide of a match. There are vehicles and drop-ins such as turrets and suppy depots that can be purchased from points earned in game.The maps, four of which are avalible with the game, and the additional four that can be obtained from DLC packs, are large, well designed, and bode well to the fast paced team combat that the game builds itself upon. Each map can be sectioned off into smaller maps, increasing the claustraphobia, and allowing for even more intense firefights.All in all, this games offline multiplayer is enough to justify the $15 price, let alone the co-op swarm mode and campaign, and if your'e willing to go to some extra trouble, I would also recommend the DLC as well.

So even though I love this game, and its predecessor, I can't play it because Microsoft sent WinLive the way of the Dodo.If you can make it work, get it. But I haven't been able to. GG, Microsoft.

												This definitely does not feel like a small downloadable product. S8: Prejudice is packed full of great content. The single player is short but awesome. Multiplayer is great but not many people to play with. Luckily you can play with/against bots. Horde/Survival mode is probably my favourite. You can also select loadouts and use it between single player and multiplayer which is pretty cool.			",253,51,12,14,17,3,32

												this game is by far a fantastic improvement from the first game, when i first played section 8 it was kinda hard to play the game at times with the mechs constantly chaseing you and being unable to get away at times. but in prejudice, its a huge improvement.Pros: its what halo and COD isnt. a stratagy firstperson shooter where you can drop anywere on a map from 8,000 feet and can kill players on impact.cons: none... other then you have to sign in or create an acount in windows live in order to 1. save you progress and 2. be able to customize armor and loadouts			",39,4,1,3,2,1,0

												I forgot I had this game long ago, but I recently decided to give it another try after 4 years. Here's where it stands:- Games For Windows Live (GFWL) is really buggy and tricky to get working, especially on Windows 10.- If you don't get GFWL working, you MUST play the 4 hour campaign in 1 sitting, as progress doesn't save locally- Multiplayer is as good as dead (also because of GFWL)But if you are willing to either mess with GFWL or play the game in 1 sitting, the game is a solid OK. It's not terrible, but it's not all that good. If you think this is basically a watered down Halo, you're correct. It's fairly cliche as far as ""military shooters"" go in terms of story, but I still found myself to enjoy my time playing. The scenery is pretty nice looking and the models have a neat look to them as well.However, there are some technical gripes to point out. FOV is absolutely unchangable, even if you go into your files, find the FOV line of code, and change the value. It seems to be locked somewhere around 70, which can get annoying on a 16:9 monitor. Recoil doesn't matter whatsoever, as spread pretty much never changes. To go along with this, there is an AIMBOT BUTTON, as well as aim assist. Pressing a button gives you aimbot for a brief period of time, and it has a cooldown. That being said, gunplay is fairly unsatisfying and not as powerful as it should seem with the gun models being as cool looking as they are.It's hard to live without a neutural opinion button on these reviews, because this game is absolutely deserving of an OK.TL;DR: It's a technical nightmare to deal with, but it's an alright game if you're willing to bear with it.

												I say thumbs up to this because the bare bones game is lots of fun. But sadly, if you try to obtain DLC, you cannot ever access what you've purchased. So BUYER BEWARE: do NOT try and purchase any DLC's. Microsoft apparently killed all that, and even though Steam displays this content, it will not actually ever be available. There are four basic maps with the original game, and it's a kick. It's lots of fun (for awhile, anyway), to just chase enemies and try and beat them at whatever mode you're using. I've played dozens and dozens of hours on this and the original Section 8.But part of me wants to give this not only a big thumbs down but also a big middle finger - for the jip that happens when you buy the DLC. Thanks to whatever happened at Microsoft, you won't ever get to access that new content. And even though Steam is hawking it, they won't address your complaints or give your money back for this issue. At this point i'm not even sure the original would work if purchased. I would suggest buying anything of this game off hard disks from Amazon or some other source.			",136,5,0,1,2,0,0

												Though it may show that I have a low amount of hours on this game, that is untrue. I originally purchased this game through GFWL, but after complications I had to rebuy the game through steam. I have about 320 hours of game play in this game. Of every game I have ever played, this is my favorite. It was the first game that spawns you skydiving on your enemy, with the ability to crush them for a first victory. It is a game that allows for a longer reaction time than Call of Duty, Battlefield, or other FPS games. This game is the most intense, strategic, and creative FPS that I know exists. For only $15 ($22 after all the DLC) it is a steal, and this is due to the fact that it is better than every $60 game I have ever bought. Ignoring to play this game is a mistake.			",22,0,1,0,1,0,4

												So glad this has a fully-featured offline mode (with scaleable bots), as well as a decent campaign - even without the multiplayer, the atmosphere, feel and satisfying mechanics of the game still makes it worth playing imo, though obviously playing with bots is nothing like real multiplayer. Note: you will need an GFWL account to save any progress, which means installing an up-to-date version of the GFWL client (wish they'd migrated to Steamworks, but too late now I suppose).Not sure why some people are having problems with the DLC - I was able to download the Colonies map pack today via the 'Windows Marketplace' and play it offline (but I did buy it years ago - not sure if that makes a difference).

												One of the best SCI-FI shooters out there at the moment. Very cheap monetarily, and much better than the usual cod. This is one of the few games where skill actually matters.EDITED: This game was once one of the best shooters out there, but thanks to games for windows live (GFWL) and the fact that Timegate went bankrupt, the game is pretty much dead. Multiplayer is dead, you cant earn unlockables and new weapons. Single player campaign is still playable, but this game was originally designed for multiplayer, not single player.I was in first place on the stats page for ages, and having played as much as i have and earned as many prizes as i did, it costs me to admit but at this moment the game is not worth the money.

												Windows 10 and 2017 after Games For Windows Live shutdown.DLC still works using work around and I love love love this game.  Matchmaking still works and its my favourite game with friends.  However you can no longer level up online due to that function shutting down.My favourite PC shooter by a long way.  Always fun no matter what's going on.Plenty of options for loadouts and objectives to pick from to suit your playstyle.And if you're after a challenge swarm mode always makes you focus.Conquest is by far the best game mode on offer, and while the campaign is fun (with surprisingly good story) its conquest where you will spend most of your time.You capture bases to earn points, control terrain and unlock varied missions for more points.Personal favourite is the jammer mission activating while online with my mate.The AI spawned in from the sky right on top of us after seeing an objective marker and no enemies on the radar.Right into our kill zone.  Coudn't shoot for laughing as the whole enemy team continually dropped from orbit into the firing line of two mechs, three machine gun turrets, a missile turrett and a whole bunch of mahcine gun wielding troops trying to steal each others kills.  What a blast!There is a great variety of weapons to pick from, and spawning from the sky is a great feature, as you aim to position yourself with your jetpacks and loadout to get the best of your enemy in a constantly changing battlefield.Great fun!

												Section 8: Prejudice is a futuristic first-person shooter that is very chaotic and fun even though the official servers are no longer active.  This can cause confusion when creating games; just cancel all sign-in requests and go to OFFLINE mode.  The ability to buy battlefield upgrades (weapons caches, vehicles, healing stations, etc) is fun and the random missions (escort, capture plans, etc) that pop up in the middle of matches keeps things exciting.  Since the game is aging and no longer supported, I only recommend when on sale.PROS+ Offline bot play is still fun+ Many different modes+ Random missions that appear during matches keeps things fresh+ Ability to purchase battlefield upgrades is fun+ Gameplay, graphics, and sound are goodCONS- Defunct servers makes setting up games confusing (tip: OFFLINE MODE)- Defunct servers limits many options (no multiplayer, no profile saving, etc)- Limited options when setting up offline games			",66,27,0,28,30,0,16

												I don't think I've ever done a review solely based on a game's technicalities so this will be a first. I just can't run this game at all. It's not that it runs poorly, crashes often, or lacks many features; the game just won't run. It won't start-up after installation. It's a real shame too. I recall playing this in 2012 and it was honestly quite fun. Since then, Games for Windows Live is no longer with us (RIP, F) and the online multiplayer functionality no longer works. I cannot recommend this currently, especially when you consider the last PC update for Section 8: Prejudice was in 2011 from the now defunct TimeGate Studios.Obligatory Score: N/ANote: Some forum users say that the game runs for them. If you already own the game, you can try your luck and see if it'll install and play.			",283,33,14,27,18,1,30

												Nice, cheap shooter. Has Single Player! campaign, co-op and mp. All maps/modes can be played offline and single player online. The story isn't impressive and you never 'care' about the characters, the graphics are a bit rough but there is a special spot Section 8 games fill that others can't (especially those of the same price range). The main drawback for the majority of people, is gfwl requirement. That right there has cost this game many sales.If you're like me and don't have a problem running games through gfwl (reguardless of liking it which I don't know a single person who does honestly), and you want a game you can enjoy online or off then try this sci-fi fps and it's predicessor Section 8. There are I think 3 DLC packs and all of the maps contained on all the DLC packs can be enjoyed online or off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The short version: This is recommended for those who are fine with a short single player campaing designed to teach you the fundementals and offline bot matches. The multiplayer is nearly dead, with only a few groups getting together in order to have large enough matches to enable ranking for gear. Other than that, it is a very fun FPS with custom loadouts and attributes.Section 8: Prejudice is fun. Its a fantastic shooter, with plenty of ways make custom loadouts that suit both your playstyle and your situation. The armor/health mechanic adds a neat balance to the game, as some weapons do more damage to health than shield, and so on. The single player campain is enough to familarize you with the game mechanics, and show you most weapons and their variants. I have personally put a lot of time into this game, and have really enjoyed it.However, it is a multiplayer game at heart. The main draw of this game was the many gametypes for multiplayer. Since the multiplayer has, for the most part, died, then the only option you have left after the campain is bots. While the bots are usually pretty good, ultimately, they are just practice. Playing offline with bots will allow you to earn most acheivements and unlock a majority of the weapons and abilities.As is the case with most of these types of shooters, many of the best benefits are for high level online players. Without getting into a ranked server, it is impossible to get these. There are only a few people who get together a large enough game to actually activate the ranking system. Combine this with GFWL, this game can be downright frustrating to get some of the features to work.As sad as I am to direct pvp and multiplayer players away from this game, it has lost much of its worth. If you get it cheap, and only with the expectation of a short campain and offline bot matches, then it is a fun shooter with some unique mechanics. For everyone else, I would not recommend getting a practically dead game. The reason I am giving it a postive review, is because it is still a great game, and it would be fantastic if the multiplayer was ever revivied.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Section 8: Prejudice. DOA by GFWL.Genre: First person Sci-Fi hitscan arena shooter with multiplayer focus. Developer & Publisher: Timegate Studios & AtariPlatform: Windows, Consoles. DRM: Games for Windows Live (No Longer Functions), Steam. Business Model: Base Game + Map & Weapon DLCs.Copy was supplied via gift from a good friendOverall Game ThoughtsHas it really been four years since Section 8: Prejudice hit Steam? S8 was one of the first memorable FPSes I played on PC and I had a good time with it. Released a year before Tribes: Ascend arrived, Section 8 was a very competent Sci-Fi FPS with its theme, action and decent balance. However, it also launched with Games for Windows Live DRM, shooting itself out of the gate before it had any chance to pick up steam. I’ve been debating if I want to give my usual rundowns of the PC settings, gameplay thoughts and other aspects of the title. Considering Section 8's current state, I feel that exercise is completely pointless. Section 8 is dead. The website is gone, TimeGate Studios’ Twitter and Facebook are silent as tombs and the community is nonexistent. What more could I really say that would matter to a potential buyer? Games for Windows Live IntegrationDue to the game being heavily integrated into GFWL, nothing works anymore. Oh sure, you can boot it up and things will show up. But the GFWL login is no longer accepted. You can’t play the single player campaign outside of one sitting because saves no longer work. It’s not worth buying for the single player campaign either. Multiplayer doesn’t work either and frankly, it’s not even worth trying to hack it to function. The community had long since abandoned S8 less than a year after launch. The years won’t have been any kinder to it. So, there’s no reason to get Section 8: Prejudice. I personally wish Steam would pull it from the store since it no longer works but there’s nothing I can do to change that. Final ThoughtsDon’t buy this game. Section 8: Prejudice is a stark reminder of why we shouldn’t use any DRM, especially poorly implemented DRM like Games for Windows Live, in any game. It’s without a doubt the main reason why S8 failed. Add on poor matchmaking plus poor development support and S8 was doomed to fail. TimeGate has no one to blame but themselves for that. In 2011, the market was spoiled for choice in the FPS scene. Putting up barriers was the absolute worse thing they could have done to the game. Even if TimeGate tried to do right by its customers now, which I sincerely doubt they’ll ever do that, it’s far too late to save it. There’s a wealth of FPSes, especially Sci-Fi ones, out in the market and S8 simply doesn’t have much to set it apart. One major mechanic I remember liking was the events system. This changed where people needed to go around the map and kept the pace flowing smoothly. It prevented boring same-old, same-old shoot outs from happening every time and I think it was what kept Prejudice going for as long as it did. But the aforementioned barriers and problems kept it down. Section 8 was a very competent and balanced shooter with a nice mix of modern mechanics back in the day. However, if it did come back, there’s simply better choices to pick from.

												I'm kind of on the fence when it comes to recommending this. The campaign mode is awful to say the least, as U.S.S 'sarge' sergeant generic space bro marine you play through a series of missions that are basically cut off portions of the multiplayer maps. The A.I works well enough, but the story is dreadful and a lot of what makes the gameplay enjoyable in multiplayer is missing in the single player mode. Then there's multiplayer which is one of the best I've played for a while. The game is sadly almost dead, so you'll have to schedule events to be able to get a group together to play some horde mode or their battlefield like conquest mode with shooting that feels very similar to Halo. Nothing wrong with that as long as it's done well. You can play with bots, which works and is fun, but you can't get the full section 8 experience anymore and with GFWL shutting down in a few months, I'm not sure what will happen to Section 8. I have to say though, for anyone who liked Halo's multiplayer mode, you will probably like this, perhaps even more depending on what kind of game modes you prefer.If you want to have some fun with it before it goes completely dead and you're not afraid to spend the small amount of 15 bucks for something you'll only have for a few months(see it as a cheap console game rental), then I strongly recommend this.

This game is hardwired to GFWL and now that GFWL is kaput, it takes this game down with it. WIthout a profile (it wont even give you a chance to make an offline one) it will not allow you to save, load, or unlock anything. I am sorry to say this game is honestly, and completely dead.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~WARNING: THIS GAME USES XBOX LIVE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Now that we got that out of the way, we can review the game. Section 8 Prejucdice is kind of a generic scifi type shooter with a pretty forgetable storyline. This is the second (and last) game in the series, and is actually the first game that doesnt play like a massive tutorial (as the first one did)Like I said before, the story mode (while forgettable) isnt bad by any means, it plays well and has just enough challange to keep it from being a cake walk. Other than the campaign you can also play against bots in a handfull of match types, none of which really do anything to make themselves memorable. There is a swarm type game that is reminicent of halo's horde mode, there is team death match, and then there is an awkward ""capture the point"" mode that has too much going on at any one time to make sense.A constant through the game modes are the customization aspect of the game. Where you can not only pick/customize your loadout (2 weapons, 2 items) you can also customize your stats. In thoery this sounds awesome! You can make a character that is a shadow, while another loadout is a heavy gunner with tons of armor and aiming assist (yes, that is a thing). But in practice, the effects are only felt when you really put a ton of points into one stat... to the detriment of all the other stats. For example: you could have an extra 25% armor... but only an extra 1% run speed and an extra 1% jump hight The bots are not particurly outstanding either, as they all seem to bounce between ""super noobish"" and ""godlike killing machine"" though the entire match.But due to the servers, and any chance at getting the super high items (read: the cool stuff) on the unlock tree, being long since dead... you will either have to find a friend to play LAN with you, or just suck it up and hang out with your virtual squadmatesTL: DR versonSection 8 prejudice is a generic scifi game with only singleplayer story mode and singleplayer vs bots modes. Forgetable storyline, generic weaponry and middle of the road bots make it a decent game, but not a great one6/10			",381,26,11,35,36,3,43

												Ok. To begin with. Robert A. Heinlein invented the idea of the ""Space Marine."" In his book, ""Starship Troopers,"" he described a spacefaring Earth society where citezenship was earned with military service. The main character chose to serve in the Mobile Infantry, the heavily-armed, orbital drop-pod conveyed, jump-jet equipped arm of the military. They fought bugs on other planets. It was great. Games Workshop took that idea, and ran with it to an extreme, for the good. And the movie wasn't bad, either. Only hindered by its budget.ALL of that being said, this game represents the truest version of Heinlein's original idea. Warring factions of drop troopers take objectives, drop equipment, and respawn by rocketing down from orbit and slamming into the turf with the force of a bomb. They have jump-boots, turbo jet-assisted sprinting,  and tons of fun weapons. You can customize loadouts, and there are some good built-in communcation features (target marking, callouts, etc.) As you generate resources by holding areas, you can call down turrets, supplies, and freaking TANKS from orbit!The game itself is multiplayer-only (it has a ""campaign"" that is basically all the multiplayer maps one after the other, vs. bots), but it does a dang good job of it. Sadly, too many people missed this game,  and you can't just jump in and find matches. If you have a big group of friends, and you want to set up a game day, or something, GET IT. It's worth it just to see the mayhem new players can get up to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very generic and also very overlooked. Flying around shooting guys is so much fun that you won't really care how forgettable everything else about this game is.It's worth playing just for single player in my opinion. The only real letdown is that the multiplayer deployables are rarely used in the campaign.			",428,185,22,50,58,4,62

												Ok. To begin with. Robert A. Heinlein invented the idea of the ""Space Marine."" In his book, ""Starship Troopers,"" he described a spacefaring Earth society where citezenship was earned with military service. The main character chose to serve in the Mobile Infantry, the heavily-armed, orbital drop-pod conveyed, jump-jet equipped arm of the military. They fought bugs on other planets. It was great. Games Workshop took that idea, and ran with it to an extreme, for the good. And the movie wasn't bad, either. Only hindered by its budget.ALL of that being said, this game represents the truest version of Heinlein's original idea. Warring factions of drop troopers take objectives, drop equipment, and respawn by rocketing down from orbit and slamming into the turf with the force of a bomb. They have jump-boots, turbo jet-assisted sprinting,  and tons of fun weapons. You can customize loadouts, and there are some good built-in communcation features (target marking, callouts, etc.) As you generate resources by holding areas, you can call down turrets, supplies, and freaking TANKS from orbit!The game itself is multiplayer-only (it has a ""campaign"" that is basically all the multiplayer maps one after the other, vs. bots), but it does a dang good job of it. Sadly, too many people missed this game,  and you can't just jump in and find matches. If you have a big group of friends, and you want to set up a game day, or something, GET IT. It's worth it just to see the mayhem new players can get up to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Section 8: Prejudice - Unfortunately deadIf you’ve never heard of the Section 8 franchise I wouldn’t be shocked. It was a bit of a sleeper on the Xbox and PS3 back in 2009. And had a sequel, Section 8: Prejudice, in 2011. But it never really made a name for itself.Section 8 is a first person shooter that is, genuinely, pretty fun and does a very respectable job of offering an engaging experience. But sadly it never really seemed to catch on with people as a multiplayer game. Currently on the Steam forums there are about twenty-five people that actively want to play the game with each other. It also doesn’t help that the PC version is hamstrung by Games For Windows Live. Which, is essentially the black plague of video games. Very few were good enough to survive it’s life sucking parasitism.That being said, Section 8: Prejudice has a fully fledged offline component with a single player campaign and decent bots. So If you were to buy this game right now there would still be content for you to enjoy. Which is nice!Sadly I found the single player campaign to be pretty dull and it didn’t grab me at all. But, to be honest I didn’t buy this game for the single player and really had no interest in it. So take that for what it’s worth.The real thing that attracted me to this game was that it appeared to be a cross between Battlefield, Halo, and Warhammer 40k. And guess what… That’s almost exactly what it is! The main game mode I play is called conquest. Which places you in a big sandbox map with various objectives on the map for you to fight over. This will require you to run from one side to the other many times over. But with up to thirty two players at a time, it’s usually pretty lively at all times.I love me a battlefield game. And they don’t even have to be named Battlefield either. I loved Big Team Battle in Halo 2, Battlefield 2142, Power Struggle in Crysis, Red Orchestra 2, Quake Wars, etc. I have a soft spot for big♥♥♥♥♥multiplayer war sand boxes. There’s just something to them that I love.Chaos, it’s probably all the chaos.Now, what differentiates Section 8 from all of the other games that I mentioned? Well… That’s probably the game’s biggest weakness. Because there isn’t really that much too make it stand out. It’s a little bit generic. It doesn’t have a particularly strong flavor to it. It’s a Sci-Fi battlefield game where in you shoot dudes, drive tanks, pilot mechs, and drop in from orbit… That’s it.Now, this isn’t a bad thing at all. Section 8 does what it does well. It just doesn’t do it better than anyone else. And I think that might be why the player base dried up. Which is unfortunate.I have a game night with my friends every week where we play multiplayer games. And I brought Section 8 up because it’s cheap and something we could all play. My friend asked me what made Section 8 worth playing. All I said to him was “Nothing in particular, it’s just fun.”Honestly, and sadly, I think that describes this game really well. It’s not particularly special. But it’s just fun. And there’s nothing wrong with that.Now, if you’re still interested let me tell you more about the general flow of the game.You move pretty slow, and are relatively fragile in Section 8. Which is an interesting combination. There are many occasions where once I start getting shot by the time I can react, break the enemy’s shield and start damaging their health… I’m already dead. This requires you to be diligent. And you really have to use the environment to your advantage.Thankfully there is a sprint that allows you to cover ground faster, but is relatively slow. In order to really get somewhere you have to run for a short period of time before you really start to go ham. But this also makes you put your weapon away meaning if you’re caught sprinting it could go bad for you.All of this to say, I find the movement to be a little too sluggish for my taste. But it does make the game a bit more interesting. Most of the maps are rather large, and usually have about four points to capture. So you really have to commit to where you’re going. By the time you get there, the enemy might have started taking another point-- or even killed all of your allies. This is partly circumvented by the fact that you can literally pick your spawn point anywhere on the map. The game has your ‘reinforcements’ in orbit aboard a massive battlebarge dropping troops from orbit. This makes things really interesting, because no point is safe. And there is almost always constant pressure from all sides! I would say this is definitely Section 8’s defining characteristic.There are also a decent variety of weapons in the game. You have the standards, Assault rifle, Sniper, Rocket Launcher, and shotgun present. As well as a more powerful ‘Machine Gun’, as well as a ‘Pulse Cannon’-- Which is kinda like a grenade launcher.None of the weapons feel as powerful as I would have liked, but they’re all usable and effective. One cool aspect of the loadouts is that you can choose various ammo types for certain guns. The shotgun for instance can fire slugs, or incendiary ammo. And that’s pretty dope.As I said, Section 8 has a decent amount of content to offer. But it doesn’t do anything better than anyone else. It’s a fun game to play here and there. But I can’t imagine really devoting a large amount of time to it.Maybe if it had a larger player base, or didn’t suffer from Games For Windows Live-itus.If you really want to play a battlefield-like, and want a game that’s similar to BF2142 Section 8 might fill that role.But I doubt you’ll be able to really play it with anyone other than the AI. Although the game is only $10 I don’t feel that it’s a worthwhile time sink unless you have friends. And for that reason I would say give it a pass.If you liked this review, check out more at 100HourSave.com ",138,23,0,25,11,0,26

												This is a great game. The spawn system is intuitive and negates spawn camping, the ability to call in air dropped mechs is brilliant, however the servers are dead and there is some issue getting the maps dlc to work. Although there are ways to fix the dlc issue. Unfortunately, outside of hamachi or similar lan programs, there isn't a definitive fix to that issue.			",260,12,0,25,8,1,6

												This game is terrible on two fronts. First is actually trying to get to the game. Prepare for 15 seconds of unskippable logos, followed by having to use Games for Windows Live, followed by having to insert the CD key, followed by various ""press any key to continue"" menus. it reeks of a sloppy console port.Second, the actual game itself had lots of potential that it wasted. The idea is that it's an objective-based gameplay where objectives spawn randomly. ""Team A guard this caravan from point A to B and get a ton of points if it makes it. team B, blow it up and get a good amount of points."" or ""A bunch of meteors just fell in this area. Whichever team collects more than half of them first gets bonus points."" Sounds like something that would foster a lot of teamwork and cooperation... EXCEPT... you'll get the most points, unlocks and rewards from just sniping from the hills at all the fools who actually go for the objectives. It reminds me of Call of Duty in a domination map where literally nobody else is going for the flags.			",65,1,0,10,2,0,6

												Incredibly good Multiplayer combined Arms shooter. It's like Battlefield in superpowered exo-suits. However I don't think you will find anyone playing it. It was always a sad story with Prejudice. Devs took complaints to heart from the first Section 8, made a great game and priced it well, and then it didn't sell well at all. Such a shame for such a good game. It has great coop too...Also there is no spawn timer because you spawn in orbit and crash down without a parachute to any point the map. And if you land on someone you instantly kill them. If you ever wanted to feel like Iron Man, this is the game to do it. WHY did it not sell well? WHY? It's so good :(This is why we can't have nice things. Or maybe it was because it was on GFWL...			",127,14,1,13,4,0,3

So many games that are all the same thing: Guns guns guns guns guns guns guns.  ""Point and shoot, the end"".So, why do I recommend Section 8: Prejudice?  A game whose company went out of business AND is reliant on GFWL (which is shutting down next year)?   Because I like it!Diving out of dropships without parachutes, simple gameplay, ability to activate overdrive to make you run fast, mech suits, jet bikes, tanks!!!!   I also like the story, though others may disagree.If you have a chance to lay your hands on this game, give it a try.  It will lead to a pleasant weekend of fun. :)			",261,77,12,21,24,7,23

												This is pretty close to BC2 in space. For $15 you get a 6-8 hour single player campaign (that walks you through all the weapons, off-hands, and maps), a Swarm mode where you defend a base against waves of increasingly difficult enemies, and 2 pvp modes. These consist of Conquest mode (where you hold control points for tickets and do DCMs for bonus tickets) and Assault mode (teams take turns defending 4 bases and the faster team to cap wins the map). Customization consists of 2 main weapons slots (shotguns, RLs, MGs, pistols, etc.), 2 off-hands (various tools and explosives), skin choices, and defense/offense loadouts. Each weapon also has unlocks for different ammo/explosion types so the customization is deep. You also get cash for objectives/kills/assists/etc. to airdrop in buildings and vehicles so your money management can change the flow of battle greatly.Don't let the GFWL scare you (it only manages Friends list & achievements) and pick this up if you enjoy team-oriented FPSs.

												A ok FPS.  Grab is low on a sale.  Downside is its a bit different than your normal FPS, but thats ok.  Its the fact that the game is dead is a real downside.  I have been gaming for about 20 years +.  This game would not make my top 100, but would if i went to 150.  Worth trying and killing some time with.  5/10 (no game is perfect).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have more hours of this game then it says and i had it right when it came out. I love it and don't need GFWL to have fun, but most people do, becuase the Campaign isn't exactly satisfying for gameplay cravings. Even with AI, it is still good.

												This review is a warning. Don't buy this game. GFWL shutting down ruined this game. it turned this game into a useless husk.I knew this game had it's online servers shut down going into it, and  I just wanted to play the offline multiplayer. What I didn't know was that you cant even create an offline account ala Battlefield 2 without a GFWL account. YOU CAN NOT SAVE YOUR GAME IN ANY WAY.  So the few unlocks you can get in the offline will not remain, and the campaign is just not an option for obvious reasons. This game needs to either have standalone steam support via cutting out GFWL In it's entirety (timegate studios went bankrupt, so an update is probably never gonna happen) or this game needs to be removed from steam so no more people are tricked into wasteing thier money for a great game that dosent ♥♥♥♥ing work.And it is a great game. think Halo + Tribes + planetside. its a damn fun game, but the fact that the game is a useless husk because of a♥♥♥♥♥♥service that dosen't ♥♥♥♥ing do anything anymore, makes this game unfortunately not worth a dime. I cannot recommend you buy this game dispite it's quality.  by some act of god this game gets revived, I will change my review to reflect that.			",71,2,3,2,8,1,3

												Feels like it still need more spice though, basically a nice game. it's much balanced and has lots of customization, campaign is short but smart.PvP gamemode can also play offline. Though if you are not so good at shooting, there is momentary lock on system to surpport quick aiming (has very short duration and cooldown).It was well made game but sadly unable to save without GFWL...So I can't recommend this unill they update saving system.P.S. I managed save problem with GFWL and found another glitch, you can't unlock all gear without leveling to play online(it's outdated, unplayable). Such a useless feature for a good game.It's still enjoyable though now I can never recommend at this point,You'd better play PlanetSide 2 or something instead.			",120,11,0,6,11,0,13

												I was looking forwards to playing this game again after stopping for a year, completely forgotten why I didn't touch it, then it occured to me.- Teammate AIs are dumb, all of the missions that involving killing you have to do by yourself.- All enemy AI know exactly where you are; even with maxed stealth, and will seek AND prioritise you first.- All AI know what events will occur and will move into position 30 seconds early to get the instant drop on it (obvious with the ""Vital Information Package"" mission).- The Difficulty doesn't improve the strategy of the AI, instead it makes them up to 300% stronger (I had the jump on an enemy but he still destroyed me with the same shotgun I used on him, with one shot). Wouldn't surprise me if they scaled the health.After playing for 3 hours I'm leaving this Review here to let myself know not to play this enfuriating game.			",96,10,0,14,8,0,3

												I *DO NOT* recommend this game as out of the 3-400 games I own, this is the only one that I could not ever get to work regardless of all the troubleshooting I have tried. It always says, ""GFWL Failed to Initialize"" which is a load of BS as all my other GFWL games work no problem. Timegate refuses to accept the problems their own, saying it is on MS side with the GFWL, even though the countless others who have this problem all say the same as I, this is the only GFWL game that does this and all other work for them just fine. So please stay away from this game even if it is on sale for 99¢, the money would be better spent on a McDouble from MickeyDs!			",841,205,18,90,57,12,98

												-DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU INTEND TO PLAY IT COMPLETELY SINGLE PLAYER-Overall Score: 2/10My advice: Don't buy, this game sucks my nuts.Genre: Halo cloneI wish I could get a time refund. I don't even know why I played as long as I did. The guns are boring, the characters are flat, the stupid story is uninspired and I think I died little inside playing through some of the harder missions for how balls stupid the AI is. Once I got to the map 'beast', it was over. The tank they gave me was a dinky piece of crap with a driver high out of his ♥♥♥♥ing mind. I couldn't change out my guns, either, and the tank's armor was made of cupcakes, while the enemies had mecha suits and nuclear warheads.Then after the thousandth time I died, the game suddenly ended. I totally did not rage quit, a message popped up and said, 'that's it, you've won, no one could play this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥long enough to beat it, here is a sticker.' And that was for sure what happened.			",455,127,7,69,23,6,41

												This game suffered from a short, boring campaign that scared the community away from its rather awesome online multiplayer. This game died quickly and was really not the amazing sequel the rather lackluster original needed to stay relevant. Now that the developer is out of business, and due to the fact that it uses GFWL, I'd reccomend staying away as the single player campaign really isnt worth the 15 dollar price tag.

												This game reminds me vaguely of Starsiege: Tribes in that you are a Space Soldier in armor that fights in vast battlefields against an enemy team composed of similar adversaries. Oh, yes, and the jetpack! You have a jetpack.Unfortunately, it is not as viable for skiing as its old Tribes counterpart, but still, it's an addition that gives a little more depth to the fights. Deciding if using it right now or waiting a couple of seconds could be the difference between life and death - although that's nearly always the case for every decision in shooters. Anyway.When you do something useful for your dear, dear team, like exterminating foes or destroying its turrets or supply stations, you always get money. That money can be spent in things like turrets, pilotable mechs and tanks and turrets.This game is clearly meant for its multiplayer, with its Conquest mode - Battlefield style - but it has a passable singleplayer campaign.For its price this game is a steal.

												Section 8 Prejudice is a decent improvement upon the first one.  I just finished the campaign today and I enjoyed it.  It wasn't ""Best storyline in the world"", but the game lands you right in the action of Alex Corde once again to save the world. Salvador has plans for contaminating civilian life, and Section 8 comes to the rescue, that's pretty much the whole story.  The multiplayer for this game is VERY satisfying.  I don't know what it is about this game but it fulfills my craving for sci-fi shooters in a way that no other game has since the original Halo. I am impressed.			",387,44,16,41,17,0,47

												Honestly, underestimated. Pretty good game. Its a few years old, so; as to expect- mediocre graphics, tolerable only really on high settings, and repetitive in-game cutscenes for certain attacks. BUT Multiplayer is great, some great physics and features in the SP campaign too. Give it a go. It could be a damn site worse.			",123,9,5,19,5,1,7

												A servicable first-person shooter for a low price. Interesting wrinkles such as jet packs, ammunition types, and customizable armor attirbutes make it different from other person shooting games set in a sci-fi setting. The inclusion of bots for all modes is a welcome addition leading to a rare case of robust offline options.			",156,8,4,12,6,1,24

												This is a great game. Has a lot of customizability with the modules, so you can make a stealthy sniper, a machine-gun toting juggernaut, an all rounder. Or make a comabt sniper that can run around the map make surgical strikes by focusing on shields/armor and speed. And a machinegun user who favors suprise attacks by having increased energy recharge and stealth over the traditional heavy armor. The options, while not endless, are many.As for the feel of the game, it has more in common with Battlefield then CoD. You can't run around spraying and praying, as doing so will end up with you dead very quickly. The overdrive ability and jetpack make it fun to move around, especially as the maps are fairly large.The one issue I really have is that the PC servers are sorta empty. This is partially compensated by the fact that bots fill in for players, and are quite competent as far as bots go. I've crested a hill before with a jetjump, only to be quickly headshotted by an opposing bot sniper.Also, you should definitely get the DLC, as they have the best maps.  ",8,1,0,2,0,0,5

												Drop down into the battlefield! No more spawning and pre-defined positions, you choose where you want to be, you fly from the sky towards your objective, crashing down in the midst of war, gun firing all the while, shooting down enemy after enemy, and just as you sigh with relief to your teammates that the control point was succesfully taken over, you look into the sky and see shimmering streaks falling down, enemy reinforcements just arriving to take back their territory. Section 8 is my favourite fps, it allows brilliant tactics, has graphics that aren't too shabby, and the gameplay is simply awesome! Furthermore, you can call in vehicles, supply drops, turrets, whatever you need in the midst of the battlefield to satisfy your needs! Hold your position, or bring hell to the enemy!

												Section 8 Prejuduce is a great game. Despite others claiming it to be a Halo-Clone or generic, this game does much that other games struggle at doing even today. The story, while simple, is solid and alot of fun. 5-6hrs for the campain is good for a $15 title, and this is BEFORE the other content. Graphics are incredible (of course, this is expected of a Unreal Engine game) and the art style impressive. There is a full multiplayer game here featuring 3 modes and dedicated servers. But wait, theres more! Character customisation comes in 4 different armor suits, and different shoulder pads as you level. In addition, you get the deepest class customisation I've ever seen in a game, this goes beyond 3 perks equipment and weapons. It has a perk system reminisant to a RPG and it WORKS. Equipment is pretty well balanced. it also sports THE most original way of spawning, dropping in from orbit (woot).For $15 and a $4 map pack, this game is CHEAP. Overall this game recieves a 9.8/10 from me.			",192,22,4,29,9,0,23

												Section 8: Prejudice is an arcade on the consoles but a windows live game on the PC. This game can be easily compared to the halo series, battlefield games, and call of duty. That is because it has a mixture of all three games. Campaign is extremely short and can be completed in  roughly 3-4 hours. Levels are bland and much boring. Unlocks on campaign does not unlock for your multiplayer account.There are five game modes on Section 8: Prejudice; Campaign, Conquest, Swarm, Skirmish, and Assault. Conquest is like your Domination matches on battlefield and call of duty, you capture a control point and gain points for your team. Swarm is a typical survival mode but with an ending. Just defend a single control point from bots. Skirmish is similar to  conquest but it does not allow to control the control points in the middle of the map. Gaining points is by completing dynamic missions and killing enemies.			",146,27,2,16,14,0,28

												Windows games for live, is it still alive?(IMHO: Game is worth a single euro without PvP)It looks like that you can only play single player game, which is boring, linear and you are constantly killed if not understanding that this is not free world game, you have a spot or area where you stand and shoot all you can see, then move to another location and repeat. Some weapons have multiple ammunitions and player has upgrades/boosts to select and to benefit your type of gameplay.Game itself looks nice for 2011 released game and it has feeling of potential as a light competitive FPS. Without Multiplayer this is rubbish.It's sliding into expensive ""joke game"" to give to your friends, like Bad Rats. It looks dead, It's crippled and no-ones playing it.

												Just plain fun, shooting, driving, jumping and not to forget .. skydiving :)Edit:The above was before GFWL died and everybody who used it got screwed over by Microsoft (something new for them! :D). Since that the game is basicly single player and skirmish in offline mode.The best of this game was the fact that it had servers with 64 players and empty places where taken by bots, so you always had 64 players ingame. Since you cant go online anymore you cant even play skirmish with 63 bots as the limit for offline games is set to 32 players.I.o.w; do not buy unless you want to try the SP-campaign which is short and was basicly just an introduction to the MP part of the game (which had a bit of a learning curve for a lot of players).

												Note: This is more of a PSA than a review.This game was great; a real underrated gem. HOWEVER, the company that made it (Timegate) went bankrupt a few years ago, due to another company (SouthPeak) suing them over the rights to the Section 8 IP (and amoung other things). I won't go over any details, but Southpeak definately did not sue because they liked the IP. If they did, they would've taken over development and support of this game. However, they have not, and haven't shown ANY signs of ever using the IP again.Thus, the ranked multiplayer servers are all gone. There are quite a few pretty significant unlocks that are now impossible to obtain. Another issue is that the game requires Games For Windows Live. Yes, that horrid thing that Microsoft did away with. However, since this game is not getting any support anymore, it has not been updated to not require GFWL.There is also a major lack of people playing this game online, mainly due to the above issues. You will be hard-pressed to find an unranked game available. (And then, if you're new to the game, you'll be woefully undergeared compared to the few vets who still play. And since ranked servers are gone, you'll have no way to catch up.)Believe me, if this game was still being supported, I would recommend it in a heartbeat. However, since it's not, I have to say you should stay away from this game. Buying it just gives more money to Southgate, and that's NOT a good thing... Plus, you'll not get anywhere near the full value out of the game now.			",421,18,3,52,25,2,75

												A great game for a great price. An incredible amount of content, that will make everyone who make the same mistake as me (buying the latest CoD games) cry in anger, at the sheer fact that a game can be full of stuff, compelling, working and, most importantly, FUN. Because this game IS fun; enough of the realism-hogs brown tint-ish copycat games, I haven't had this much fun ever since I stopped playing UT 2004. Tactic, fast paced but not based on reflex, with guns that feel right and plenty of customization and specialization, it even posses a depth that you would not expect in its combat system.Must buy			",186,33,1,27,35,1,28

												This game was great.  Unfortunately  it has since past its prime with not having a large community to begin with, the developer going bankrupt and the subsequent owner dissolving and GfWL shut down.  You can occasionally find servers, and bots are always an acceptable alternative.  Instead of solid classes with fixed loadouts, you can configure your weapons and passive stats to your liking (or just use the presets if you're lazy), and you will always have a jetpack and a super-sprint.  The game has large maps (with smaller edits if those aren't your thing) with up to 16v16 players, all designed with verticality and spaciousness in mind.  All players have the ability to buy tanks (with bunny hop), mechs  and bikes and turrets practically anywhere on the battle field.  And you spawn almost anywhere by dropping down from space.

At the time I would have rated it an 8/10 but with the other games that stole its styles and design it has been reinvented on many other platforms.  I would now rate it a 6/10 as of 2014 for any gamers wanting to buy it.  I would pay 4-8 dollars for this product for its single player campaign, and if it still exists, its multiplayer action.

												This is a really fun little game. Section 8: Prejudice is basically a low budget, science fiction Battlefield, with a few neat touches of its own to boot. An important part of the game, it that trully makes you feel you are a futuristic super-soldier, with the ability to sprint blindingly fast, jetpack into the air, and use a limited lock-on ability with your weapons, all right from the get go.The primary goal of each map is to capture points around the map, much like Battlefield, but interestingly, small side-missions pop up while the larger battle is going on, which can net your team additional points. This keeps the battle dynamic and a little unpredictable, keeping a handful of capture points from being the sole focus of all combatants.I also really enjoyed that vehicles and other supplies need to purchased and dropped in from space, rather than just respawning after a period of time. The same is true when you die; you are given the option of being dropped from orbit, allowing you to land behind enemy lines, provided they haven't set up anti-air auto-cannons to destroy you in mid-air.S8 also includes a fun four-player co-op mode, similiar to a horde defense mode from other shooters. While the single player is pretty boring and repetitive, and not worth the time, the different multiplayer modes are all great. It's unfortunate this game didn't do very well, despite its bargain bin price. It's unlikely there's much of an active community left, as it was on the smaller side even on release in 2011, but if you have three friends, I recommend picking up the four-pack for the co-op at the very least. It's one of the best budget shooters out there, and some of its innovations outdo the bells and whistles of the FPS heavy hitters out there.			",149,29,0,13,23,1,40

												Section 8 Prejuduce is a great game. Despite others claiming it to be a Halo-Clone or generic, this game does much that other games struggle at doing even today. The story, while simple, is solid and alot of fun. 5-6hrs for the campain is good for a $15 title, and this is BEFORE the other content. Graphics are incredible (of course, this is expected of a Unreal Engine game) and the art style impressive. There is a full multiplayer game here featuring 3 modes and dedicated servers. But wait, theres more! Character customisation comes in 4 different armor suits, and different shoulder pads as you level. In addition, you get the deepest class customisation I've ever seen in a game, this goes beyond 3 perks equipment and weapons. It has a perk system reminisant to a RPG and it WORKS. Equipment is pretty well balanced. it also sports THE most original way of spawning, dropping in from orbit (woot).For $15 and a $4 map pack, this game is CHEAP. Overall this game recieves a 9.8/10 from me.			",192,22,4,29,9,0,23

												Drop down into the battlefield! No more spawning and pre-defined positions, you choose where you want to be, you fly from the sky towards your objective, crashing down in the midst of war, gun firing all the while, shooting down enemy after enemy, and just as you sigh with relief to your teammates that the control point was succesfully taken over, you look into the sky and see shimmering streaks falling down, enemy reinforcements just arriving to take back their territory. Section 8 is my favourite fps, it allows brilliant tactics, has graphics that aren't too shabby, and the gameplay is simply awesome! Furthermore, you can call in vehicles, supply drops, turrets, whatever you need in the midst of the battlefield to satisfy your needs! Hold your position, or bring hell to the enemy!

												This game is one of the best multiplayer shooters of the year, but it has a couple of big problems. The first is that there is a set of perks that is very overpowered and disables you in one shot. It takes a lot of experience points to unlock this, so good luck getting it yourself at this point. The second is that there are barely any people still playing this. Bots are passable but will get old fast. If you have some friends to play with, get this.			",486,132,11,76,48,4,73

												It's a pretty good game, the graphics and audio are both well done. It's a lot of fun to tank things and the gameplay is enjoyable. However, everything innovative that the first Section 8 brought has just been cloned. I repeat: there is nothing new in this game, at all. The story was awful, I think they should have just left it out, and the campain lasts long enough that you'll just get bored with it. It is probably OK if you haven't played the first one, but it's just so repetitive...			",615,190,20,65,43,5,93

												So this game is somewhat better. At least i've lasted through the single player campaign longer than I did in the first one. I do want to continue the single player in this game, but i've been distracted by other games.The voice acting gets on my nerves a lot.One of the first vehicles you encounter is a vehicle that looks and controls exactly like the Ghosts in Halo. That's a lil' tacky. Though if there's anything this game is trying to cash in on, it's Halo.Aiming with your mouse in this game pretty much simulates aiming with a joystick for a console, which is something that a lot of console to PC ports have problems with. Didn't seem as bad in the first one though, but I could just be imagining things.			",298,46,1,37,11,2,24

												I would wish I could recommend this, as it has great potential as a fun game, however, with timegate no longer operating their main servers are down, and most unlocks (rather critical for gameplay, even against bots) these unlocks are no longer available.If these servers were online it WOULD be a great game, make no mistake, but the campaign is hideously inadequate to purchase the full game for, as one can apparently expect for a multiplayer-focussed game.

												Multiplayer has no dedicated servers, it sounds like some people are hosting small servers still. The developers really did the best they could with GFWL, and it actually supports offline play so the story mode and multiplayer practice with bots works. This was a great game that never got hyped in time.Fans of Halo, Tribes, or Crysis should enjoy the game. interesting and fun combat here. Dropping in from the sky is the best method I've ever seen for spawning: no spawn camping, great map awareness, and the most satisfying feeling crashing to earth and maybe killing someone on impact. Combat is fresh and fast, suit customization is well done. I enjoyed the game primarily offlline, and it would've been amazing online with friends. Seems like every game that approaches this awesome design eventually vaporizes. Still, I recommend the game if you like the style and will take the chance of offline play. If you can get multiplayer to work with friends, I think it's still a great experience.			",430,126,11,41,29,1,58

												Very fun game once you understand how conquest and the DCM's work. I wouldn't pay more than $15 for it though. It's an optimized game with a growing user base. Conquest is a lot like Battlefield. You have control points to capture. You can purchase vehicles and turrets and deploy them almost anywhere on the field with the money you rack up by getting kills, repairing/destroying things, capturing control points or completing DCM's. DCM's are extra missions that occure randomly during multiplayer and completing them or preventing the enemy from completing theirs gives your team extra tickets to win the round. Weapons are unlocked as you level up and you can customize your load out or use any of the standard classes already edited for you.I can't comment on single player since I have not gotten very far but this game is more for multiplayer.

												A really awesome MP shooter. It'll be probably live a short life in terms of its community as downloadable MP shooters are want to do (see Monday Night Combat) so get in while you can. There's your usual levelling up system and plenty of unlocks to work for and the game is pretty balanced weapons and items wise. Good players still wreck you but hey that happens in every game.There's a pretty bland SP campaign which I've played a bit of. It feels a bit tacked on but good enough for what is and trying to achieve (adding a bit more value to the $15.) The usual horde mode and variation on the main MP mode, too, which aren't fantastic but worth a play through.The only bad thing about this game is GfWL which actually  runs pretty smoothly and I haven't had any problems. It seems wholly unecessary and Steamworks would have been better. The server browser suffers as a result (though Quick Start works pretty well) but hey porting costs time and money and its been ported pretty well.			",227,70,7,39,13,3,41

												Section 8: Prejudice is a very solid Sci-Fi shooter; in fact I haven't had this much fun with a PC based Sci-Fi power armor game since Shogo. Then again, there aren't many of them. But the systems are really nice, the AI is decent and does more than just have head on assaults, and your squaddies are actually a help. In addition, the weapons have a nice feel to them, the armor really feels like powered armor, and the orbital drops are just really cool. The ability to change your loadouts not just based on weapons, but on ammo and supporting tools is nice also. The storyline is solid, and the voice acting decent; it's a pleasant surprise to find a shooter with a decent single-player storyline these days.  Definitely Recommended!			",510,56,11,76,49,2,102

												Section 8 just manages to fall short of being great, having high mobility, configurable weapons and almost elegant controls that place it firmly on the Global Agenda axis of FPS.  The single player campaign is short, clocking in at around seven hours, but actually has a pace and difficulty curve that was enjoyable.  A solid buy during a sale, although I don't know how populated or active the multiplayer base is because I'm tending to eschew online play due to a growing and unmitigated dislike for online gamers.

No more spawning and pre-defined positions, you choose where you want to be, you fly from the sky towards your objective, crashing down in the midst of war, gun firing all the while, shooting down enemy after enemy, and just as you sigh with relief to your teammates that the control point was succesfully taken over, you look into the sky and see shimmering streaks falling down, enemy reinforcements just arriving to take back their territory. Section 8 is my favourite fps, it allows brilliant tactics, has graphics that aren't too shabby, and the gameplay is simply awesome! Furthermore, you can call in vehicles, supply drops, turrets, whatever you need in the midst of the battlefield to satisfy your needs! Hold your position, or bring hell to the enemy!

												Section 8 Prejuduce is a great game. Despite others claiming it to be a Halo-Clone or generic, this game does much that other games struggle at doing even today. The story, while simple, is solid and alot of fun. 5-6hrs for the campain is good for a $15 title, and this is BEFORE the other content. Graphics are incredible (of course, this is expected of a Unreal Engine game) and the art style impressive. There is a full multiplayer game here featuring 3 modes and dedicated servers. But wait, theres more! Character customisation comes in 4 different armor suits, and different shoulder pads as you level. In addition, you get the deepest class customisation I've ever seen in a game, this goes beyond 3 perks equipment and weapons. It has a perk system reminisant to a RPG and it WORKS. Equipment is pretty well balanced. it also sports THE most original way of spawning, dropping in from orbit (woot).For $15 and a $4 map pack, this game is CHEAP. Overall this game recieves a 9.8/10 from me.			",192,22,4,29,9,0,23

Veteran Tribes players will enjoy the vertical combat while the Unreal engine delivers solid ground-based and vehicular combat. Oh, and did I mention it's $10-$15? Section 8 Prejudice is more bang for the buck than most fifty dollar games on Steam right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A simple, generic sci-fi shooter, with a slight Tribes feel. Too many guard this point, defend that structure missions that slow down the story when you just want to get on with it. Limited jet-packing brings the inclusion of that rare feature down.			",94,16,1,11,7,0,32

												Section 8: Prejudice is a very solid Sci-Fi shooter; in fact I haven't had this much fun with a PC based Sci-Fi power armor game since Shogo. Then again, there aren't many of them. But the systems are really nice, the AI is decent and does more than just have head on assaults, and your squaddies are actually a help. In addition, the weapons have a nice feel to them, the armor really feels like powered armor, and the orbital drops are just really cool. The ability to change your loadouts not just based on weapons, but on ammo and supporting tools is nice also. The storyline is solid, and the voice acting decent; it's a pleasant surprise to find a shooter with a decent single-player storyline these days.  Definitely Recommended!			",510,56,11,76,49,2,102

												Section 8 just manages to fall short of being great, having high mobility, configurable weapons and almost elegant controls that place it firmly on the Global Agenda axis of FPS.  The single player campaign is short, clocking in at around seven hours, but actually has a pace and difficulty curve that was enjoyable.  A solid buy during a sale, although I don't know how populated or active the multiplayer base is because I'm tending to eschew online play due to a growing and unmitigated dislike for online gamers.

												The first Section 8 was a bomb. It wasn't bad, but its content didn't and simply couldn't justify its hefty price tag. Almost two years later, TimeGate has returned with its core franchise, this time stronger than ever in Section 8: Prejudice.Gone is the shoddy campaign comprised of just bots and multiplayer maps and introduced is actual gameplay tailored to the single player experience. The campaign spans 4-5 hours, but that's just barely the surface. Prejudice, at its core, is a multiplayer game and within that realm, you have a variety of modes: Conquest (two teams vying over control points), Swarm (survival), Assault (teams take turn attacking/defending bases) and Skirmish (team deathmatch).Conquest mode utilizes a dynamic mission system which offers random tasks (escorts, assassinations, etc...)  in addition to competing for control points, adding more depth into an already meaty game.For $15, it's a steal. For $5, it's a ""must buy"".Grade: A-			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												It's a team based fps shooter which takes you to the battle field fighting for either Arm of Orion or the Section 8. There are 4 game modes being conquest, assault, skirmish, and swarm.Conquest being the standard mode your team must compete for control points while accomplishing dcm's (dynamic combat missions) ranging from protecting and or destroying and outpost  or escorting a vip to safety and or assanating that vip. Skirmish is your classic deathmatch type scenario while assault has two roles being attacker or defender. Defenders will Defend their cp's from the attackers as they storm the bases for their own, once cp is taken it is then locked and cant be recaptured.Last but not least there is swarm mode where a team of 4 can take on waves of AI and survive to achieve victory. There are many diverse weapons to choose from along with moduals to customize you for how you choose to play. It was deffintly worth my money and time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game is a refreshing pace from the COD clones they crap out nowadays, and hey, it's only $15 for 4 BIG maps the size of Battlefields! and it has 4 modes of play, one being a decent single-player, the other 3 being Conquest (Battlefield mode), Assualt (Capture the base as fast as you can) and Swarm (horde mode).So, $15 for COD map pack or a full-fledged game? you know which one is right.

												In this game, you fall out of the sky and beat the living♥♥♥♥♥♥of the ground around you when you land. After that, you pull out your ""lasers"" and use those ""lasers"" to ""lase"" the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the enemy team who also have ""lasers"". Once you've killed enough of them, you buy a big ♥♥♥♥ing bike, run them over, and use that money to buy a giant mecha tank thing which you can kick even more♥♥♥♥♥with.This game is fun and worth your money.
