												Possibly the best product Valve has ever pushed out. Ditched with the saddest excuse saying the game was just to test their free to play system.A game which could have had endless amounts of content, updates, and a huge playerbase.Not to mention the use of .vpk files instead of .bsp which made them not download-able directly from the server and required installing them via third party like old school mods which made the modding community very weak.Lack of updates and the game eventually died.. in the hands of its creator.9/10			",125,6,0,6,1,0,2

-Quick Review-Alien Swarm is a Top-Down shooter with emphasis on multiplier teamwork with four total players. Alien Swarm was developed by Valve and released mid 2010. Many of the initial players were lured to the game by the lure of an Alien hat you can unlock via an achievement on Alien Swarm.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You are a member of a team of space troopers who are investigating the circumstances of a seemingly abandoned/evacuated space colony, and trying to recover whatever data is still available.

Gameplay: Alien Swarm is played from a top-down shooter angle from a 60 degree camera angle, you move your cursor to aim, and can simultaneously walk any direction using the keyboard keys.Some people have dedicated servers for Alien swarm, however most people will simply host a game from their computer, your latency will depend on the hosts internet settings and physical location.As you succeed or fail missions you will gain experience, this experience is put towards your level, when you level you unlock new weapons, armor, and tools. There are 25 potential weapons that can be chosen from, including special weapons like sentry guns.

Achievements: There are 66 achievements on Alien Swarm, after your first level you will get a good grasp of the different achievement difficulties, at the time that I'm writing this review, I've earned 53 achievements, most of which were earned either grinding by myself (by using a console command, it's possible to play solo online), or joining small groups online or playing with a friend occasionally.There are two types of tough achievements: Beat the game on the hardest difficulties, and speed run achievements, both of these require a fairly coordinated group of players to work together and know what they're doing.Price: The best part about Alien Swarm is that it's completely free! This is probably because the project was scrapped after the first campaign. It's nice that this game is free, but I would have preferred to pay for the game if it had a single player mode and more campaigns.The good news is Alien Swarm was released with an “Alien Swarm software development kit” which is also free, so the Steam Community could create their own campaigns! Second best thing to the original dev's picking up the project again.

Conclusion: Story: forgettable, but this game is more about the experience then the story narrative. Gameplay: addicting, fun, best to play with friends. Achievements: Many are soloable, you're better off with a group of pug players the easiest difficulty is your best bet if you want to learn the game. Not an easy 100% completed game. Price: Completely free to play.I love this game, even if it's free to play.  I've enjoyed playing this game in between playing other games more vigorously.  I recommend this game to anyone who wants a change of pace from the ""status quo"" of games out there. ""This game will specifically appeal to gamers who enjoy dungeon crawlers, third person shooters, and alien kill grinding.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update May 30, 2015:spelling, grammar, and punctuation fixes, thanks Angfucious! :)			",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												Alien Swarm is proof of Valve's willingness to allow their IP's the experience of rotting to death for their own personal gain via staff resource redistribution.  Forget Half-Life 3; if this excellent game could only get a single 15-minute campaign, then there's no more hope for the niche fanbase of Valve's bygone excellence.			",865,261,38,108,86,11,169

												Great and free. Better than the paid-for Alien games. The 4 player co-op can be intense. Good character leveling/tiny RPG elements and many, many weapons which are actually useful. Only bad thing is the story is pretty short and the actions stay the same during all reruns. But oh well, if you download custom maps you can enjoy it....... forever.			",527,205,25,67,60,8,64

 Overview  Alien Swarm is a game with a unique and interesting backstory to how it came to be. Sporting a top-down camera with an adjusted 60 degree view and set in a sci-fi realm, Alien Swarm arms you and up to three additional friends for some seriously fast-paced shooting and survival combat.For those unaware of the history of Alien Swarm, it was created from a mod from Unreal Tournament 2004 by a team that was hired and supported by Valve. Originally, the game was produced by Valve, but unlike some of the more popular titles such as Counter-Strike, Team Fortress or the Half-Life series, it never really got the focus and recognition that the others did. In fact, there is only one official campaign in the entire game, called “Jacob’s Rest”, which is comprised by only a handful of levels. However, that does not necessarily detract from the overall appeal of the game. An obvious downside to playing Alien Swam, as mentioned, is the one solo campaign. Within the confines of this one mission, your task is to land on a colonized planet, investigate what happened, exterminate all hostile alien lifeforms and rescue any survivors. You’re given a choice between four classes: “Officer” – your primary gunner who earns passive damage and resistance bonuses as well as unique weaponry unique to only them, the “Medic” who heals teammates, the “Tech” who can deploy sentries, hack systems, weld doors with incredible speed and can carry class-specific grenades and auto rifles, and lastly, the “Special Weapons” which boasts massive damage output. Within these classes are 40 different equipment pieces that you can select based on your class, play style and need, making customization fairly simple and streamlined.The game, as mentioned above, as a major drawback: that one campaign. However, the game included the software development kit [SDK], which, for those not familiar with the term, is the source code to it, allowing for full-scale modding and customization. This spawned a vibrant modding community that has made some truly fantastic campaigns to play, keeping Alien Swarm alive and well with new content and challenges. With the SDK included, users can play any of the user-created content, create their own or modify ones to their liking or specifications.With all that said and as with other Valve products, Alien Swarm has a smooth multiplayer interface, full overlay support and integrated invitation options to invite your friends. While playing solo is fun in its own right, the game really shines when playing with a group of four, invoking the need for communication, teamwork and support of everyone involved; make no mistake, Alien Swarm can be extremely punishing.A variety of difficulties, friendly fire penalties, tight corridors and waves of aliens means Alien Swarm will test both your reflexes, intuition and ability to work together as a team. Don’t get cocky, because when you die the game will freeze and slow motion capture your painful, premature death and let you know who killed you. So if you’re use to blaming your “friendly” fire on glitches, your friend or the enemies, the game will most certainly be there to call out your transgressions for all to see.With consistent statistical data being tracked outside the game [much like other Valve titles], Alien Swarm provides an in-depth look at what classes you excel at, what weapons you prefer, your accuracy and how many times you sabotaged the mission with excessive friendly fire and much more. It becomes a handy tool when deciding who you want to complete some of the more excruciatingly difficult achievements the game has to offer. Alien Swarm is one of those games I feel should really be re-examined because what is here, is wonderful. Smooth level design, crisp features, class customization, full source code and level design and a great atmosphere make it a great game to play for newcomers and veterans alike. There’s a severe amount of untapped potential within Alien Swarm. Did I mention, it is free? Pros   It’s free so there’s no risk involved. Try it! Solid multiplayer and co-op supportResponsive firing mechanics Class variances make each class important in their own way SDK support for complete editing and modding support. Make your own campaigns! Cons    The original campaign is the only one that was introduced with the game, making the starting content lacking and the downloading of mods necessary to fully enjoy this title and increase its replayability. Overall, Alien Swarm is often overlooked by other Valve titles. While the consensus among fans is that it is a worthy title to sit down and play, many people might not be familiar with it or know how it came to be. As more and more titles are being released every day, Alien Swarm still stands as something worth playing, even after all these years. Seriously, get out, recruit some friends and go blast some aliens. You won’t regret it.			",640,213,19,74,88,12,80

												I've played Alien Swarm quite a bit already and I gotta tell you it's awesome. The default campaign is already loads of fun to do with friends, and with the different difficulties you can really make yourself struggle. I think it's most fun to play with friends while communicating over TS/Ventrilo, but playing it with randoms is fun as well! There are a huge number of custom campaigns out there which are really nice. The controls are nice and there are no real downsides to this game. This game is free anyway so why not give it a shot?

												First of all, this game is great and free!So at least give it a try yourself.It's a great coop based game. To take the best out of the game you have to work together and play your part in the mission.The official campain is great fun and you can play it over and over again, trying different ways to beat it.Join ASB, Riflemod or chickenscoop servers to have even more variation in Alienswarm.Sadly, this game does not have a workshop. That means you have to manually install map packs when you want to play other maps than the default 7.To get most of the game with additional settings, pvp modes, 8 player coop, new weapons, challanges and pre installed maps get Reactive Drop. Though make sure to join the official RD-group for scheduled events.			",72,3,2,2,4,0,7

												Alien SwarmAbout a thousand hours spent in-game. Met the most decentfolks. Enjoyed every bit of it. Alien Swarm is completely free andworth more than a good part of my backlog put together. If you haven't tried it already and you like top-down real time tactics. I highly recommend giving it a try.There are always some dedicated servers with somepeople playing. There's an active modding community,and ingenious maps still being added to the game. Be aware, you might need some hundred hours to wash the addiction out of your system. It tookme about five times that amount. And I still findjumping back in every now and then.//edit:-------Some of the most dedicated folks from the communityare also working on a huge mod that has been recentlygreenlighted, in case you long for more and haven'tstumbled over it://edit:-------For all your Alien Swarm needs regarding Maps, Modifications and archivedInformation, you can go to https://sites.google.com/site/swarmaddons/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As others said, this game is good, and although devs kinda stoped working on it (because they don't eat for free), i thank that the game is still available to play :D.Mates, if you say ""only one campaign"" or ""game is short"", I highly recommend to play ""fan made"" campaigns. Try the old school: search google + ""alien swarm maps"", not that hardput the .vpk in ""...\Steam\steamapps\common\Alien Swarm\swarm\addons""a few examples of good maps:paranoia_full_versionas_arctic-infiltrationresearch7the rest see reviews or try them yourself			",24,6,2,6,5,0,22

												This game is hardcore oldschool skill based shooter. There is no mercy for people without eye/hand coordination.  You must think about health,ammo,friendly fire,being infested and many more. Normal mode is good for start. Real fun start when you are aware of enemy types and know how to counter them as a TEAM. Yes you can solo in this game but... the real fun of squad based shooters begin when you cover your mates and act your role :) Lots of weapons and additional equipment make this game fun as hell when you try diffrent configurations. Have fun even if it not too long. MapPack is avaiable to download :)			",113,16,1,9,8,0,20

												If you are looking for an action shooter with team cooperation where mindless running will get you killed this is a game for You. On most dificulties the games enemies coming in waves enforce cooperation. Fireing lanes start to matter and even when you are not on point but securing the back You feel like Your job matters. The game offers 8 marines to pick from. A pair of each of 4 archetypes. The medic, whos main role is to heal any damage and cure infestations. The Autogunner whos there to push the group forward or to set up supressing fire defending the group. The demolitions marine is best suited to dealing with heavier targets with the use of flamethrowers, mines grenades fire traps and the mean end of a shotgun. Finaly theres the technician for those who want to make the missions easier by welding doors and hacking security and objectives. Individual skill is rewarded with all of these archetypes without the loss of sense of benefiting from the teamwork of entire group. The setting pays hommage to classic movies and games of the alien franchise yet remains its own kind of alien style with a bit more arcade look. The topdown camera gives a more tactical feel for the gameplay in comparission to first person. Each marine has his own quips and oneliners, and character. Since its free i cannot see how you wouldnt recommend it.			",7,2,0,1,0,0,2

												Why steam hasn't milked the f*ck out of this instant classic, we'll never know. I would gladly pay 20$ for a few more maps. And I would pay another 20$ for custom characters or stats to level up. I was very happy to find other people still enjoying this game. I think there is also a greenlight project to get more levels, vote for it!			",70,11,0,7,6,0,24

												My God, This is a really good game back in the day.The problem is that it was too short, but for a free game, who cares?Pure co-op fun, it is easy to learn, has a shipload of weapons, every one of them with a specific purpose and an almost infinite number of builds, where most of the time you have to run against the clock.It's a shame the community has almost vanished now, but if you have 2-3 friends who would like to test it, go ahead, I recommend.

Product received for free
												Interesting top-down shooter that is free to play for all Steam users, uses the Source Engine 2010.  Based on the movie Aliens.Alien Swarm is a top-down shooter set at a 60-degree angle. Four players can join a single co-operative game, the aim of which is to progress through science fiction-themed levels while eliminating waves of AI aliens. Players can choose from 40 different pieces of equipment. The game is class-based, with players choosing from the roles of Officer, Special Weapons, Medic, and Tech. Each class has two selectable characters, with differences in abilities. Officer = Grants a passive bonus to damage and damage resistance to nearby allies. He has access to the Vindicator, a class-restricted shotgun with an incendiary grenade launcher and has general all-around abilities. They are also capable of throwing extra amounts of explosive ordnance, and may find class-restricted ammo caches on the field for his Vindicator shotgun. The two playable characters are Sarge and Jaeger.Special Weapons =Brings raw damage to the table and starts out with a customized autogun with superior parameters, high magazine capacity, and auto-aiming ability. The Special Weapons gains access to a powerful minigun at a high enough level, and can pick up class-restricted ammo caches on the field. The two playable characters are Wildcat and Wolfe.Medic= Is the only class able to equip and deploy temporary healing beacons, and at a high enough level can use a medigun to selectively heal teammates and themselves. The two playable characters are Faith and Bastille.Tech =Carries a motion sensor, sets up sentry guns faster, welds doors faster, and is the only class capable of unlocking certain door panels or completing certain objectives by means of a hacking minigame. They also have access to a prototype assault rifle with auto-aiming capabilities and the ability to fire stun grenades. The two playable characters are Crash and Vegas. The game includes persistent statistics, unlockable equipment, and Steam Achievements.for more info:

												In a gist, it's a fun top down action game that eschews stats and loots for a more tactical and visceral experience. The core of the game is planning your route through the campaign and mowing down hordes and hordes of aliens as you and your friends are barely hanging on to life. Sweet.Some things in Alien Swarm that I would love to see in other games of this genre:- Shared map where you can all plan your route. - Minimal loot, minimal stats, focus is on loadouts and interesting effects (freezing, burning, electricity etc.). Going through loot is tedious when all you are doing is increasing DPS.- That climatic end. Believe me, if you don't spoil yourself by playing on a lower difficulty, the finale is worth the wait.- The tactical nature of the game. The game gives you a lot of tools and weapons. Bar the door, and the alien has to spend time smashing through it. Lay a wall of fire and watch the hordes melt before your eyes. But all the defenses are temporary, and the aliens can and will overpower/overrun them. You and your friends have to plan properly to use your limited resources for victory. Some of my favorite moments in this game is defending a point while hordes and hordes of aliens stream in from everywhere. All the defenses and traps we laid are exhausted but we do manage to pull through.On top of that, with friendly fire on, you really have to plan things out so you don't end up shooting each other. You even lose ammo if you reload early! That's a feature that's missing on a lot of games. There are some cool things in this game borrowed from third person shooters, like crouching (for cover) and calculating line of sight so you don't hit obstacles/the floor/the wall. Definitely makes the game feel more ""grounded"" and adds to the tactical layer, although I honestly don't remember if I ever used crouch.Get some friends, play on brutal (yes, from the beginning), and have fun.

Playing with friends over mumble (or equivalent) is obviously the most fun, but even random match ups works really well due to UI and map layouts.

												Alien Swarm is a fantastic, top down co-op shooter which deserves more recognition than it got. While it only has a short campaign (which can be played with up to four friends), there are many addon campaigns and mods online, which make a substantial difference to the experience.Best played with friends, there is still an active community around this game, so finding other players shouldn't be too difficult. The standard campaign provides decent challenge and entertainment, especially when you increase the difficulty.Best part? Its completely free... you have nothing to lose by giving it a try.

												Alien Swarm is a game forgotten by both Valve as it's developer and the community. A game that had potential, but comes out just feeling unfinished. The concept is good enough, but it probably got canceled and someone just decided that it would be shame to leave it, and put up what they had at that time. And well, if it wasn't good enough, people didn't like it enough for it to become good thanks to the community.The only thing that truly keeps this game alive, if you can even call it alive, is the fact it's fully Free to Play. No payment on Steam, no microtransactions, nothing. You can join the fray at any time and see what they got in store for you. However, it still features a level system - the more and the better you play, the bigger level you are and the better equipment you get.This unlocks one of the games biggest advantages - a very smart equipment system. You can choose between four classes, with two characters for each, both with completely different playstyles. Then you get to choose your equipment, two weapons and a utility. Of course, all four of the classes have access to equipment available only to them, as well as access to certain shared equipment. For example, the Medic is the only one capable of carrying the Medikit or the Medigun, the Commander is the only one capable of carrying shotgun, the Engineer is the only one capable of carrying a rifle with autoaim etc. The game then features more than 40 weapons and about 15 utilities (if i recall correctly). This allows you to play the game differently every time, but thanks to the level system, certain weapons will always be better than others, even though the game does try to balance them out.The gameplay is then based around a co-op mode for four players. You (and hopefully a team you can trust) are sent to a colony gone dark to investigate, and *drum roll* fight off aliens there *badumm tshhhhh*. However, you are alone. So you need to conserve ammunition, use medkits and cooperate while holding off the bugs in order to survive, and fulfil objectives along the way. All in a top-down Source game. That means the SDK makes the maps quite interesting, counting in things like fire, liquids or destructible enviroment, even some in-game animation parts along the way. This all creates a feeling of being swarmed and overrun, yet deeply dedicated to ending the mission succesfully and without casualities. Talking about casualities, it's worth noting that there's friendly fire ON by default. Watch it.Probably the most notable change is the Source SDK here. If a big community would be on... millions of maps. IT's just that easy to make them. Tile based creation and Source modelling = Map. I tried it out myself, it took me exactly 76 minutes to recreate the first level. It's just sad it is not used.Also please note that Win 8 is not supported by this game. It will run after you install it, but Win 8 will screw up it's files and you'll have to reinstall sooner or later.As to my recommendation, I can say that this is a game you will enjoy at first, and then become disappointed by later. Play at your own risk.			",132,19,3,13,14,1,19

Wtf are the Bugs on the left doing?.. 
A Screenshot of Alien Swarm
By: Jaeger




The amount of self-created memes and laughs you can get out of playing a game to death is great, but then theres the fact that you played the game to death. Its a game that classifies itself under boring in long sessions but can never be left completely because the short focused fun with friends is worth it 90% of the time, I think i can definitely say that after 700 hours (And..slowly counting.). Its a borderline arcade game which certainly explains why the campaign is so short (7 x 10 minute long missions.) but at the same time has some great full on action game moments. Its very dated and has bad graphics by today's standards but makes up for it with a Top down action experience that valve did well to make (for the SHORT time that they did). Since its free i hardly need to sell the best bits of the game but you read this far lol.

A Screenshot of Alien Swarm

aaanyway this is a great game, its a very different game to what valve normally does with first person, AWPs and Expensive Hats .It is extremely team based for two reasons, 1-Bots are just terrible (the worst bot in my opinion is called faith which is extremely ironic...) 2-You need friends to cover your♥♥♥♥♥at all times on the harder difficulties. The fact that its a team focused game has got me to play it quite a bit, hardly any time solo in fact. Its an interesting mix of taking care of the team, keeping an eye of many things at once and knowing when to stop shooting and heal up.. You might even meet some new friends..i mean  marinesAnyway i can condense many paragraphs into simple pros and cons so here they are:


Too Late the Hero 
A Screenshot of Alien Swarm
By: Jaeger




PROS:+Action scenes are epic as hell and the final fights in the campaign missions are very climatic.+The finale of the campaign is so well done, overall its length is average but the final part of the story is shown so well amidst all the damn swarm!+Levelling and prestiging system is fair and provides good weapons for bad players and vice versa. Its very balanced, which is funny because the humans are fighting aliens! not each other..+Some weapons feel like they are built for levels and other feel like they are built for medic, heavy, etc. which is obviously great in such a class focussed game.+Characters have unique personalities, yet dont do much else than shoot and talk, although this isnt really important for the type of game that AS is.+many Custom maps are avaliable! although since its a dated game it isnt as easy to get access to as L4D2 for example. thats one of the main problems with this game, its dated but more importantly, not supported for valve anymore, no updates new maps , etc.+The Ending is great and sums up the little story that this game has. Little to no sequel material (Obviously!) generated here.+The shared map feature where you can draw on a map to show your team mates the best routes!+the Hardest mode is actually really hard! and may take weeks to master levels by yourself or with 2 players.+Speaking of hard difficulties, playing action music works really well when battling through a level with friends, it really fills in the gaps where the games epic soundtrack should behttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=846178288CONS:-The Simple fact that its an old game is enough for 6 cons at least.Just be ready for glitches, bugs, aliens, crashes, bad optimisation, frame drops, and obviously all of this happens in the worst moment (Murphy's law?)-some of the best weapons that are great in getting achievements and speedrunnig are aaaall the way at the end of the unlockable weapon armory. this is just to get people to play longer but its still annoying for newcomers with experienced friends!Speaking of newcomers.. This game is literally only klept alive by TF2, how is that you say? Well there is an item for tf2 that can be exclusively gained in this game by playing 2 co-op missions online (Too easy!). I personally find it sad that this game is kept alive by tf2 and dedicated players obviously but its clear to see that the popularity is waning. This isnt the fault of the game however. Its still amusing to see what people will do in tf2 to get a new item ;)-Default key binds i found to be very uncomfortable. This is easy to change however.-Every time you fail a mission it doesn't give you an option to immediately restart it and instead, takes you back to the weapon select menu. Which is damn annoying because the load times are normally irritatingly long.-The story is decent...But far too short!!!-Valve has indirectly killed this game by not adding workshop in its prime...Its quite easy to see how this game could have gone down a different path if you didnt have to go through the hassle of downloading the mod packs off a site rather than just downloading it straight from the steam workshop.I seems L4D2 proves this point well! Since its still a strong game due to the modding community..-They should have added a bit more story or at least a new mode such as survival, play as the alien or target Practise. Which is funny because L4D2 has all of those modes!! (Replacing aliens with zombies obvously.)-No Starship troopers references-No nods to alien. The parasite doesnt count!-First person view is extremely difficult to find and activate! If there isnt an instant bind for it then why bother?http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=642721022Dont be fooled by the size of the cons list vs the pros, it just the explaining created the illusion.I'd Rate this game an 8/10! Great for a free game!And thats my review for this free game! It currently has an overwhelmingly positive rep on its page, lets hope it stays that way. :)Im so excited for AS: Reactive drop!!Now if youll excuse me a Glitched bot is getting attacked on the other side of the map..-Kyle ",82,13,0,3,2,1,2

												First game I ever played on Steam, years ago now.  Helped me come to accept that Steam wasn't malware :P.Some people say that the community is dead, or bad.It's not, there's still a large number of pro players active.  Many welcome new players.  Some times when you try to find a game, at that moment, there may be none available.  Still plenty of people playing; each lobby holds 4 players, each game takes a few minutes.  Every full lobby is invisible.  People come and go.  Consider starting a lobby yourself if at that moment you cannot find any players, it's rare for more than a couple minutes to pass without someone joining.  If nobody ever joins your hosting, check your ports, maybe you're not set to handle hosting - that would keep people out of your game for sure.Or just check for open games in 30 seconds or so.  There's often quite a flux of players going.Years after I started to play this game, I keep coming back to it.  I like how the teamwork works, I like how the game is complex enough at the higher levels that I'm still getting better at it, even after so many hours of play.			",123,26,0,38,51,0,33

												This game is really fun and great for jolly cooperation. I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it yet. The only problem with this game is that it is very short; it desperately needs more content. Either the creators need to make more campaigns or give out a map editor or something for the community to make more. This game has a lot of potential. I just hope the developers realise this. ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ More content or RIOT ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ  ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ More content or RIOT ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ  ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ More content or RIOT ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ  ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ More content or RIOT ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ  ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ More content or RIOT ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ  ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ More content or RIOT ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ			",99,11,0,16,3,0,7

												Custom map packs can be found Here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/630/discussions/0/864945140574517670if you have problems or questions installing, i have a guide for that.The game is good. really good. it just has no content.from what ive heard, Valve made this game as a test for some new employees (Black cat games? I don't know). The way i see it, it turned into an expiriment to see if a community could keep its own game alive. it was the sort of 'power to the people' thing that the unreal tournement mods had (hell, alien swarm WAS an Unreal Tournement mod.)The game was basically made to have custom maps made by its community. Its Open Source with a very large number of spare unused assets not found in the only offical campaign.They had a website to upload this content. That site was Swarm armory.Not long after, the plug was pulled and Swarm armory never came back up. Without a sort of 'Offical Hub', noone wanted to hunt down the download links to the maps people were playing, and people gave up on looking for them.  The things people worked hard on were altogether forgotten or were only found by an incredibly small number of people, and that made a good number of the map/mod developers just give up and move on to somthing else.     The only newcomers to this game are blokes looking for the parasite hat for TF2. they basically never stick around either, due to lack of content and any form of offical modding support.Bearing this in mind, I belive the game was meant to be run entirely by its community. (though I would REALLY love to see Steam Workshop Support...) There ARE people who play the game often enough, and as far as I know there ARE people who are still developing maps (slowly). You just gotta look for them. Hard.Only complaint: why the ♥♥♥♥ is a flashlight a high tier item, and why is nightvision not nightvison?			",97,5,0,6,6,0,6

												Alien Swarm is a top-down shooter. The game has a campaign that can be played in co-op with up to four players. There are four classes available: Officer, Special Weapons, Medic and Tech. Each class has two characters with different stats for one or more of the following: aim, ammo, reload speed,  special abilities speed and others.It's a great short game, also it's free! It takes about 1-2h to finish, there are quite a few difficulty modes and other settings that add a lot of replay value to the game, such as friendly fire dealing more or less damage, and onslaught mode, which brings a high variety of enemies to the beginning of the game to make things more interesting.Unfortunately not many people play it these days, but I still enjoy it from time to time.

												The game presents one of the best isometric coops I have ever seen. (And take in consideration that I'm writing this in July 2016). It's well thought of, dynamic, stable, and challenging. You have to actually coordinate with the team, pre select the gear, get good with the class you use, etc.""Watch where you are shooting, shitbag"" is the most common phrase you gonna hear in the voice chat. Because when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan, everybody panics and shoots and pray. And you can shoot with a good variety of guns, and inventories are not over colmplicated.Cons: mmhhh, the game starts right up, in a slow pace, but some mechanics are not explained at all, and in the middle of the chaos you can get confused at first with what the hell your self healing pack does, or your welder... but that's old school and cool at the same time. Not really a con. If I may, there's only one real con:TOO SHORT, and no steamworkshop... what the hell? I could play this for years with no problem, dammit steam!			",50,10,4,3,2,0,3

												Ah. One of Valve's babies... Alien Swarm. Completely lost in time, this fun alien top-view shooter puts you in control of a marine that is sent into a colony to kill the alien ""swarm."" Though it is free it lacks a lot of content. Now I do know this game was primarily made for the people to mod and make games out of ( Lambda Wars is a very good example) it has barely any campaign. If you have a good team the whole campaign can be completed in an hour or two. Very challenging if you don't play for a while and you really need to depend on your team-mates. #makeAlienSwarmGreatAgain,Valve!			",104,16,1,17,9,0,18

												 Available free of charge, the game thrusts players into an epic bug hunt featuring a unique blend of co-op play and squad-level tactics. With your friends, form a squad of four distinct IAF Marine classes. Plan your attack using an unlockable arsenal of weapons with countless loadout configurations against a wide variety of aliens. Blaze your way through an overrun, off-world colony, eradicating the alien infestation in environments ranging from the icy planet's surface, to a subterranean lava-flooded mining facility. Along with the game get the complete code base for Alien Swarm that features updates to the Source engine as well as the SDK. Alien Swarm adds 3rd person camera, depth of field, improved dynamic shadows and a wide variety of gameplay additions to the Source engine.			",434,115,4,50,30,2,54

												Alien Swarm is pure co-op goodness, it's a damn shame Valve never supported this game beyond its launch. There's only one short campaign, but it's always a blast to revisit, especially on harder difficulties.			",112,19,4,5,4,1,5

												Alien Swarm is a freeware top-down shooter video game by Valve Corporation. It's a remake of the Alien Swarm mod for Unreal Tournament 2004 and it was developed by the original team, who were hired by Valve during the course of the development process.A simple, fun and sometimes madly frustrating game. Personally recommended to play as a team of 4. A somewhat steep learning curve but other then that it will hold solid entertainment for a numerous amount of hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's free, it's pretty crazy, and you can play with up to three other people. With the leveling system unlocking guns all the time and the crazy amounts of crazy you can get depending on what difficulty you choose, this game can actually last you a long time. You can't go wrong with at least giving the title a try. I personally really enjoyed it.			",283,89,5,41,38,3,51

												The game is a lot of fun, and rather basic. Playing on the hardest possible difficulty with swarm mode on from the beginning is a good idea. It makes it impossibly difficult at times, but the reactions people have at the swarm is hilarious.			",55,8,0,20,10,0,16

												alright this game was better then expectedme and some friends were looking for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ co-op free to play games and then stumbled uppon this gem. we decided to go ahead without looking at anything before hand. so there we were, all in the 4:6 glory playing on brutal. it doesnt matter. this game was too. much. fun. im not kidding. i thought that this game would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥. but it holds up. even if you suck and have no co-oprative skills and enjoy team killing, its still fun. the controles are easy to figure out so you can literally pick this game up and play right away.PROS+can double turret in loadout+team killing +can camp in spawn 4 evah+♥♥♥♥ing with others on dedicated serversCONS-team killing -♥♥♥♥ing stock valve sound effects-needing a tech all the god damn timei honestly cant recommend this game enoughdownload it now, even a potao could run this.

												Having over 150 hours on record, this is easily one of the most addicting (at least, at the time) free to play games I've ever laid my hands on. Once an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, is now a polished standalone game, kind of a sequel of sorts, on Steam.It's a third person top-down shooter in which you and three friends blast your way through levels infested with hostile aliens and complete various objectives as you work your way through areas. There's quite a bit of weaponry to choose from as well as items, most of which you can unlock by completing levels and gaining exp and thus leveling up eventually.I kind of wish Valve would make a sequel to this with like 4 or 5 campaigns so we could buy it, play it, and love it.

												Alien Swarm is a free top-down cooperative shooter where you will have to pass a small campaign of 7 levels of shooting down cute aliens who look like cousins to headcrabs from Half-Life franchise. It's a remake of Unreal Tournament 2004 mod with same name, I sure remember playing that one once.The thing is, this game is strictly multiplayer. You can't beat it in single-player. Well, I mean, you can surely force yourself to, but it's not designed for this, hard and doesn't reveal full potential. Game has practice mode with bots, but only through the first two levels. Otherwise, you better find three more marines like you. Thankfully, public multiplayer is active enough, can find at least one game running.And yea, it's focused on teamwork by using loadouts. Got to balance between general and specialization and then not to shoot each other during gameplay. While campaign is short, it grows in difficulty non-stop, so there will be a challenge to a good team. Can always increase difficulty.It's just a shame that it doesn't fit to lesser player count. I mean, would be nice to have it like in Left 4 Dead, where all spots are always filled with bots and players just take their place, and thus can always expect a support. Because when you play it with just one friend, it's hard to balance between firepower and special stuff. Almost always one tech, almost always one medic or you will die. But hey, not designed for that after all. It sure can be tough with just friend even on easy, sometimes.Oh, there is no microtransaction. Valve didn't bother to profit from this in anyway, it's just that some devs that Valve hired were original creators of Alien Swarm mod for Unreal, I heard. It got modding support, but no Steam Workshop. And uses leveling system with which you can unlock new items as a way to prolong the life.But eh. For free, it's pretty nice team game. But could use better music. Like most games.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												Atmospheric:The aliens in the vents make their noises,and the motion scanner bleeps kep you on the edge of your seat,and make you fall off when you wander into an ambush.Hard:This game requires tactical eye and teamwork between you and your squadmates.You must play smart and look after each other, because that is one less gun in the game, and your chances of survival become very slim at best.Fair:If you get eaten it means 'you dun goofed up'.Tie game doesn't resort to cheating.The alien AI is quite smart and they caneasily outsmart you if you aren't paying attention.Fun?:Alone:It can be fun, if you are skilled enough and are used to RTS games. But it can be frustratingly hard solo.With 1-3 friends:Two-player game is quite fun, but this game shines with a full squad of human players as you struggleon towards your objective, counting on each other,and hoping you can pull it off without any hirches, and that everyone survives. Of course, this is where friendly fire comes into play.'Friendly fire is not'. You WILL take damage from squadmates.In the beginning you are more likely to die froma squadmate trying to shoot an alien trough youthan the actual alien. In this game players need good communication and discipline to make it troughwhile still being ready to take action at any time.This doesn't mean this game is meant for twitch players.I'd say it is quite the opposite. You can survive by playing the game as a twitch action shooter,but you can negate need for reflexes with some tactical awareness and being in the right place at the right timeand anticipating the enemy.The only negative things I can say about this game isthat there aren't many enemy types and themain campaign included is a little short. I really do wish they added more official maps to this game. Overall?This game is hard. But incredibly rewarding. And free. Definitely worth adding to your Steam library and giving it a spin.So what are you still waiting for?Click that ""Play Game"" button already!LOCK AND LOAD!P.S. Did I mention you also get a free hat for Team Fortress 2?			",676,70,46,55,37,2,65

												Alien Swarm.This game is a birds-eye co-op game that is qquite fun but has some issues.1) Community - This game can be very fun, but nobody plays it. Working in teams of four is the only way to beat missions on tougher difficulties but the only way to have a team of four is to play with friends or on singleplayer (which sucls)2) Class restrictions - While you can play as any class in the game 2 are required for most missions. The Tech, who unlocks doors and completes objectives is required for some missions and if they die, you lose. The Medic - THis is the main problem, because there is no good way to heal other than the medi-gun some player is froced to go medic. Not too bad sometimes but if no-one else your playing with has unlocked the medi-gun, it can be hell.3) ITS TOO SHORT - A huge problem with this game is that it only has one campaign with 8 or so missions. These can be really fun but once completed there's not much to go back to.Now that I'm finished with negatives, here are some of the postives1) Classes - You can play as four classes, which are usaully fun with a good loadout. The Leader has a nice all-around skill, The Heavy just shoots the crap outta the aliens, the medic will save you from parasites and death and the tech unlocks doors, completes adjectives and is very useful. Oh and did I mention there are two characters of each class, for more variety :D2) Parasites - Yes, I just said parasites are a positive thing for this game. Parasites are small aliens that latch onto your head and maul you unless you can be healed. While these can induced frustrating and quick deaths, they are a challenge that forces you to stay together with your medic.3) Aliens - Of course they had to be in here! While not in to much variety, the types that there are make the game interesting (and sometimes a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥).4) The weapons - You unlock weapons as you level up. Sentries can provide a quick escape from a quick death and the flamethrower is incredibly fun to use!5) Levelling up - Levelling up gives you a sense of achievement as you shoot the crap out of aliens with that amazing new minigun you just unlocked6) And finally loudout customization! - The game features 3 slots to change weapons, a primary weapon to kill things with. A secondary or piece of equipment. This can be more ammo, another weapon, a sentry etc. And finally the 3rd slot (forgot the name) which can carry passive armour, light attachments, welders (very useful) and other helpful things.7)It's free too! (almost forgot.In summary it's a fun game but it has a small community which can ruin it. But all-in-all you might as well try it out because its freee!			",42,3,0,6,6,0,12

												There is a lot of fun to be had here once you get the hang of things and start to understand the few maps the game has.  You do need the right team-mates however when playing online because team-play only enhances and prolongs the fun while  running off by yourself will only make things harder.There is enough variation in the gameplay with different classes who each have their own strengths, abilities and (unlockable) weapons. As well as the levels that you go through that all have their own objectives that you need to accomplish before you can move on. It keeps things fresh and interesting for a little while, though that replay value could have been longer if the campaign wasn't as short as it is. Luckily there is always the modding community you can trust on to provide you with tons of new maps you only need to do a bit of work for it because there is no Workshop support as of yet.Best thing of all though.... it's completely free!

												I like this game very much. Because I am playing it with my friends almost every day. I have gotten the last achievement in 236h of gaming. But enough of me. I am going to do some pros and cons for the gamePROS-The game is very well done, the graphics for my PC are stunning-The game is based for CO-OP or should I say Multiplayer, because if you play Offline Practice (Singleplayer) the bots are stupid and are sometimes pain in the ..... so it is useless to play singleplayer-Another pro is that the Valve has given us the Alien Swarm - SDK tool, so the community can make it's own maps and campaigns instead of Valve-We can make our own servers with Alien Swarm Dedicated Server tool, which I see every day there are only 27 servers, which 6 of them are constantly full-This game is simple to play because it is born with ""Rock n' roll"" style-If you get bored playing only Jacob's Rest campaign, you can download custom campaigns on moddb.comCONS-Valve has forgotten about this game-Community is slowly dying10/10 for me, would Rock n' roll againI strongly recommend this game to everyone who wants to have fun without Pay To Win system. This game is FREE!It only matters your personal experience!Have fun playing this game!			",89,1,3,1,7,0,7

												Alien Swarm is easily my favorite top-down shooter game to date and it's 100% free, created entirely by a team of 4 modders hired by Valve, Alien Swarm shows that top-down shooters can be so much more than monotonous room-clearing wave fests populated entirely by tie in movie games.A co-op centric game, Alien Swarm does one of my favorite video game elements I never thought to see in a top-down shooter, team based gameplay, including several classes, all of which have their purposes, Officers support and rally the squad, Special Weapons use hard hitting rapid fire weaponry, Techs hack and weld doors shut, cutting off Alien ambush points and Medics Heal and keep the team in good health. Every class also gets thier own set of unique weapons, the Officers Vindicator shotgun is a personal favorite.Level design is excellent, but this shouldn't be surprising comming from Valve, the layout accomodates for both players and enemy AI alike, sporting choke points for players to cover one another from and ambush points for the aliens to really get the heat up, it's for this reason you'll commonly find yourselves forming a diamond-esque formation, so that a number of your squad is pushing the team forward whilst the others are stopping any potential attacks from behind as you attempt to complete your current mission objectives.You wouldn't think it, but Alien Swarm is also very rich in atmosphere and story, littered throughout levels are several datapads, leading up to-and explaining what had become of the colony of Jacob's Rest - The location which the game takes place - and sound design helps to add the overall presence the game gives, the sounds of claws rattling throughout the vents of the colony, the punch guns give, giving satisfaciton with each shot fired and each enemy slain.All in all, I feel like a criminal playing this game completely for free, the quality is far better than alot of other top-down shooters out there charging an insulting £10 price, if you have a group of friends or just want to go on a well constructed bug hunt with some randoms, I see no reason why you shouldn't give this a shot. A very friendly and active community, several weapons to unlock and try out, tertiary abillities to use, from grenades, temporary slow motion to missle barrages, Alien Swarm is a good time to be had by all.

												Pretty awesomesauce game, though at times it's easier/tempting to just run past all the aliens rather than derping around fighting them and wasting your goods. Also seems to work well with potato laptops that aren't sure how to run games that aren't Tetris or Minesweeper.

												I loved this game~ It's light, it's cool, and it's sci-fi. And it's -not- FPS (though I hear you can make it go into first person view). Unfortunately at the time I played there weren't any other people to play with, but that doesn't make it any less fun. Even the default offline mode was fun. I do wish it had more maps and levels for offline/single player as well and/or online solo maps for beginners.Edit: Wrote a new, more proper review below:I feel like this is a really underrated game. It’s a shame people almost no longer play this game, because I just really enjoyed it. It's light, it's cool, and it's sci-fi. And it's -not- FPS (though I hear you can make it go into first person view). Unfortunately, during the time I had it installed and played there weren't any other people to play with, but that doesn't make it any less fun, as you can go into single player mode. Even the default offline/single player mode was fun… for a while. The game is a pretty typical top-down shooter with a leveling system to acquire better upgrades and weapons. It’s actually quite nice, if not overly original (group of marines hunting down bug-like aliens). The graphics and sounds aren’t anything to write home about, but they’re not bad either.I do wish it had more maps and levels for offline/single player as well and/or online solo maps for beginners, though, because as far as length it’s quite short, and after playing it over and over on your own it gets rather boring. I know you can manually install different maps, but it just becomes a hassle, as the game doesn’t have workshop integrated. This is really a game best enjoyed playing with friends, and that’s how I recommend you play it if you’re interested.  And the best part of all? It’s free! ;)			",753,484,13,105,82,9,90

												Good multiplayer game and it's for free. Singleplayer is also available, but this game was designed for coop mode. Since the community is almost dead, you'll only have a chance to play multiplayer if you invite your friends.

												Great free game, i got a little addicted to this when it was first released. The game is almost dead now so if you wish to play and get the achievements i'd recommend getting 3 players off your friends list and do it with them. You can download maps made by the community for a change of pace and quickly get the grinding achievements.			",230,73,5,17,14,1,48

												In case you all ask: I didn't try this game out just for the hat. I just wanted to try something new.And, well... this game gave much more than I expected it to give.It's a great four-person co-op game. You and three other players take on the roles of a Marine squad dropped into a colony overtaken by an alien infestation. This takes you on a campaign consisting of seven missions, watching your squad in top-down view kick♥♥♥♥♥The controls are the simplest, but that doesn't mean the worst: you move with WASD, aim with your mouse. It's bare minimum, but that's very intuitive and aiming is made a lot easier by this.There are four character classes: Officers, which use powerful Vindicator shotguns with huge stopping power and also increase the abilities of their squadmates, Special Weapons who use heavy autoguns to mow down enemies, Medics who tend to the team's health and Techs who are able to use tools better than others and perform hacks. The game offers two characters in every class, each one with different abilities (for example, between the two Medics, Faith is faster and a better Medic overall, but Bastille is tougher, better at combat, and gets a bonus to using adrenaline shots). This not only allows you to choose a character of the required class that will suit your playstyle, but also puts a hard limit on the number of duplicate classes a team can have (since there are two characters of each class, that means - go figure - up to two of the same class). Something a LOT of modern class-based games would use.In terms of weapons, you get only a handful at the very beginning, and unlock more as you gain experience and level up. However, standard weapons are usually the most useful and reliable, with only a few really neccesary unlocks (such as a medigun. Yes, a frikkin' medigun. Which works just like any TF2 player would imagine it to work). This makes resetting your levels for cosmetic ""promotions"" not that painful, on the other hand.The game gives you a variety of enemies to fight: other than the standard Drones, Rangers and Mortarbugs which attack at a distance, Boomers which are basically walking suicide bombers, Shieldbugs which require flanking and teamwork to hit their weakpoints, and Parasites which can infest and kill a marine very quickly, unless the Medic takes care of the victim.The official campaign, while very short, has a high replayability, and the game also offers the fan creators development tools to create their own works.Unfortunately, despite its high quality, the game isn't too popular. You might find maybe 20-25 dedicated servers and 5-10 lobbies at any given moment. Speaking of the lobby option, it doesn't show you the ping of that particular one. You're forced to connect and then use the ""ping"" console command to check it. It's kind of a waste, but that's a technical problem that could be easily fixed, and doesn't really matter in the long run.Overall, this is a very, very good game. I highly recommend it to any survival horror fans, as well as shooter players and co-op gamers. It would be a sin to not at least give it a try.			",100,18,0,17,2,2,5

												This game, while small, is a great game from Valve that's like a top down version of Left4Dead except with alien bugs. It runs on the Source engine and enables people to make their own maps which is a plus. I like how weapons are unlockable but the default weapons still can stand a good chance against enemies on higher difficulties. Overall, it's free and I can't think of a reason not to buy it! Valve sure knows how to cater it's fans with free little gems like this game!			",764,243,22,69,56,7,103

 MY REVIEW ON A GREAT GAME To tell the truth, I loved this game  A LOT , because it brings back memories to when I first joined steam. It was my first.... no second game on steam, my first being portal 2  FYI, Portal 2 is awesome :D , and I played a ton of co-op, like, literally, a  TON . Sadly enough, besides nostalgia, and a free TF2 hat, this game has no reason for you to be playing it.You may not know, but this game is actually, truly free, and the community lets you know about that. I particularly like this one review of the game:Originally posted by ShMo:I got it for free.Downloaded it for free.Played it for free.Leveled up for free.Got all the gear for free.Reset my level to get a Prestige badge for free.Died for free.Got good for free.Speedran a few levels for free.Beat a level on the highest difficulty for free.Recommended the game for free. 	Anyhoo Did I really just say anyhoo? , This game has the Left 4 Dead 2 style of co-op where you do the singleplayer missions for co-op, and that's cool. But, some of the objectives are  UNBEARABLE  without more people, and even then they are still a pain. I don't have much to say, so thats it.This was my review of Alien Swarm, and I hope this taught you a bit.			",69,4,0,4,8,2,2

												This is one of the 1st Co-op games I've ever played on steam, and continues to be one of my favourites. It has action, thriller and teamwork all bundled up in one campaign that you must complete with 3 other players. I had good memories playing Alien Swarm with friends and others a like. Despite the repeitition of the game (there is only one campaign in the game), the outcome may differ based on your team composition, experience and other criteria. I also heard from a friend that this game was basically a F2P version of Helldivers too, lol.Unfortunately Valve no longer has updates for the game, and because of that there are many old glitches, bugs and other technical issues that hasen't been resolved by the developers. For me, the loading screen tends to stretch longer than that of my team members sometimes even leading to crashing the game.Luckily, a lot of these issues are resolved by members within the Alien Swarm community, which I would add, is fairly small now but still a nice place to relax and communicate with other members. It's an old game, but still fun to play imo. I recommend playing it with friends, as there aren't many public matches nowadays.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alien Swarm is a team based birds eye view space themed shooter that in my opinion is quite underrated. Firstly, it is by Valve so you know it is good, except in the case of Ricochet but anyway. There is a large arsenal of weapons, tools, sentrys and other cool stuff to choose from and unlock from beating parts of the main Campaign with friends. I wouldnt say its something that brings new things to the table but it is still a quite fun game. But now the downsides, firstly, the game is barely played by anyone and there are pretty much never any servers open and the only way to level up is to play with friends or on servers, and for people like me who have no friends, it is quite annoying. secondly, Valve never bothered to make a second campaign for the game and it literally takes about 30 minutes to play through the whole game, so it gets quite repetitive if you are trying to level up and get new wepons, tools, etc. because you are playing the same 30 minutes of gameplay over and over. and finally, I am quite dissapointed that there is no way to unlock a rope so I can hang myself which we all know is a vital aspect of any game. So that lack of a rope really lets this title down. But I would still say the gameplay is fun and it was a good idea to begin with, even if it wasn't free I believe a game like this would be worth your money if you enjoy games of this genre. I just wish Valve expanded on the campaign more, and added a rope feature.			",85,8,0,4,4,1,5

												A really brilliant freeware game. After a few minutes playing it, you will definitely love it. It has its downsides, like the repetitiveness of the levels, but who am I to judge them? It has alien carnage, tons of weapons, teamwork and the best part, it's free! A ""must-give-it-a-try"".			",457,209,7,77,41,6,76

												This game is one of the best games out there for top down shooters. Very comparable to Helldivers but even more exciting because it brings along with it a very high level of suspense and ""oh crap"" moments which all happen in a split second whereas with Helldivers you sort of see that coming. I absolutely love this game and the level up system designed to it. I haven't tried it but I'm going to see if I can't play this with my playstation 4 controller and mouse and keyboard and team up with my wife and kill some aliens together. If I can't please please make that an option I would easily pay 20 dollars for this game to be full up and if it had around 30 or more levels I would pay 60. Absolutely Brilliant!			",46,2,0,6,9,0,3

												This could be pretty fun but the problem is finding people. It's not that you won't find anyone but sometimes you gotta wait for some players to appear. All the maps/servers are well designed and gameplay is intense. But it's advisable to go with other players. Going alone would simply mean a suicide mission. It has everything which a free2play gamer desires except enough people. But servers are not empty you always see old loyal users/players from this game who are always there to fill that space. I recommend this game and I feel this game is still fun.Here's my gameplay video:

												Alien Swarm is a top-down sci-fi class-based shooter where you maneuver your character using the keyboard and aim using the mouse, mowing down alien hordes who are attacking you. It's best played with a group of friends, but well...it's free. Well worth the price of admission, sure, but it's genuinely fun to run through once or twice.

Of course there is more to it than that, you can choose 8 classes.  I think that includes Tech, Medic, Heavy (not sure name), and a support character (not sure name).  You have a leveling system which lets you keep unlocking the good stuff. This is an amazing game for no cost at all.

And yes you will scream like a sissy too!

												Definitely download and play this game, if you love Co-Op.It's quite similar to L4D 2, but it's not a FPS, so you don't have to worry about what's expected to come at you. Also, the game's camera angle is used similarly to Dota 2 and LoL.Anyways, the gameplay is amazing. If it's your first time playing this, I would suggest playing Offline Practice, before you start playing Online.The basic plot of this game is that you are a team of 4 Space Marines, and you're fighting against the Alien infestation. Also, this game is objective-based, so you have to work together to accomplish them.Overall, this game is good, with no PvP, but Co-Op instead.8/10			",68,4,4,6,8,0,3

												This is one beautiful game. The only problem is, Valve stopped working on it so they could work on Dota! Damn, I would love to see more updates for this game, and I'd always choose Alien Swarm over Dota. From picking your specialists, to choosing your weapons, to enjoying the campaign, this game brings a lot to the table. If I had to rate this game, I'd rate it a 7/10, it could be a lot better if Valve kept working on it!Alien Swarm had a lot of potential! For what it is now, I still recommend it to anyone who loves killing aliens and hanging out with friends. Oh, that brings me to something else, there's almost no lobbies! If you're going to play, make sure you have a friend or two with you. Would love to see a successful Alien Swarm 2 someday.			",62,6,0,6,4,0,2

												As much as I hate third-person overhead games, this was surprisingly designed well to get used to. Gameplay is a combination of TF2 and L4D with a little wiggle room on the weapon types. L4D since it requires four players, and TF2 with four classes. My pet peeve with this game is that it only has one campaign, and since it is like so many years old without any updates, the online community is nearly dead. Pick up a friend to play this game and have a good time for a bit. This game has so much potential, and I hope to see a big update soon or Steam Workshop Integration.			",568,354,11,80,58,6,65

												It was a couple of summers ago. A friend and I had nothing to do, and we got bored of the usual few games that we engage ourselves with: Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress 2 and so on. We ran out of things to play with empty wallets as well. We were students, merry, but poor, and then we saw this new free-to-play game on steam known as Alien Swarm. No harm giving it a try, right? Little did we know that we will be spending the whole of our summer rolling around a blue-themed spaceship setting aliens ablaze. Alien Swarm is not a big project or game in particular, or so to speak. There is only one campaign of 7 maps to choose from, and the game itself gets repetitive in the long run. Still, what makes this game fun and captivative is the co-operative nature of this game and the array of weapons the game offers. Choosing the right class and weapon will be highly beneficial for the game play as having the right setups will shorten or lengthen the gameplay by up to 10 minutes, and there will be a drastic difference in reward as well. Since this game uses a leveling system, it will mean that one of the best case scenario is to look for a map where you can do quick runs (in a minute or two) over and over again so as to accumulate the largest amount of experience in the shortest time possible. One thing I am found of for free-to-play games developed and published by valve, especially Alien Swarm in particular, is that there are no micro-marketing. Meaning, every single item in game are attainable through a little bit of hard work and grinding. It’s free, and if you have the time to spare, what’s your reason for not trying?

												This game is incredible considering that it is free!-It has a large plethera of guns each of which has a specific purpose,-There are multiple characters (8) to play as, and they are not only divided into classes, but are also give separate attribute boosts to things such as healing, damage, hacking, etc.-Combining the characters and guns in different ways helps benifit your team and the gameplay in a lot of different ways, and opens up a lot of unexpected cumstomization.-The enemies are INCREDIBLY varied, and how the levels and difficulties work make the gameplay aything from CoD-level gameplay to Dark Souls level mayhem.-The community is good, i have yet to meet a single douchbag or 10 year-old playing this.-And even if you suck at picking up games, or haven't ever palyed any top-down-rpg/shooter stuff like this, the way the levels progress make sure you get much better by the 2nd level. (This also adds into the benefit of the community as there are VERY few players that will need to be carried through any levels)			",91,10,0,14,4,1,14

												10/10Alien Swarm is a fantastic sci-fi top down co-op adventure. Gather your fellow space marines and embark on a journey of heroics and alien obliteration. The campaign is too short, and the user made maps I've tried were not too interesting, but there are five difficulties (brutal is definitely brutal, and you'll need to make good use of a full squad), and speedrunning will keep you busy for many hours! I think it has to be the best free to play on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alien Swarm is an interesting game. Interesting in the way it plays, and the ideas behind it. When it first came out, it was expected to be a simple base for people to mod with. Not an uncommon feature for a game, since there are games just for modding like Gary's Mod. Yet, Alien Swarm didn't change that much once released. The community didn't mod it, and those that did never made much head way.But thats beside the point. The game is great for some fun times. The co-op campaign is fun, and having someone there to cover your back is nice. Aliens come from everywhere. From the vents, holes, cliffs, even a few test tubes on certain levels. You can spot some entry points easily, but always be ready to turn around and fire after a few seconds. Aliens also tend to swarm you from behind if you move too slow. The game is meant to be a run and gun through the hordes of aliens, often running back once you reach a dead end. It also offers a nice variety of aliens, from the standard minion to the hulking tanks. Each mission is unique, and always challenging when played again.The only downside is that finding a group to play with is a bit hard. While the game is free, very few people stick with it. For many it will be a simple beat the campaign, and move on game.So grab it, play it, and have some fun.			",322,54,2,99,96,4,100

												There aren't many games as underappreciated as this one. A ton of fun with friends, granted they can cooperate with you for the duration of a campaign, and the modding capability of this game is absolutely insane. It's one of the last truly moddable Source games, in fact.This raises an interesting question, though: Where the ♥♥♥♥ is the modding community for this game? You literally have a plop-and-run mapmaker in the ♥♥♥♥ing game for testing layouts that allows you to import your own map pieces in VMF format, what's the deal? Get cracking on a campaign.

												Alien Swarm is pretty much an overhead version of l4d but it is a lot harder. But this game also has perks such as you can modify your own char to what it has and what it can do such as weapons and abilities also the class of the char you are using also matters since you don't want some really weak person that can't to jack on your team. When played with friends it's a whole other ball game where it becomes crazy fun and the replayablity value is all over the place not only that but this game has GMOD CONTENT. My final rating for this game is a 7/10.			",80,7,0,3,4,0,2

												This game is one of the few good free games on steam and I feel it doesn't get the attention it deserves so yes I recemmend this game game to anyone who's a fan of sci-fi games and the gameplay is better than I thought it would be for a top-down shooter. I discovered this game when I was an f2p n00b in tf2, I got killed for the thirtieth by some guy wearing the Alien Swarm Parasite and it was awesome looking to me, and I would stop at nothing to get this hat, I looked up the hat name online and found it was a promo item for this game. I did some more research and found that the game was free, and in my mind I was like: ""Awesome hat. Free game. Must download."".  And so that's that, I found this freaking awesome game, played the **** out of it, and now it sits in my steam library begging me to play it, and I do every once in a while. The biggest let-down was when I first played the game, I thought it would be some awesome popular MMO that would be the best game ever, and when I finally did play it. It was like some run-down depressing bar that I just walked into. The thing that ****** me off about this game, specifically Valve, is that they just said it was an expirement to see if a game like Left 4 Dead would work, and the free-to-play section of the steam store. I would pay Valve to continue support of this game such as updates and the steam workshop.			",54,3,1,5,6,0,4

												Still one of my favourite ever games... free to play but by no means poorly crafted... an incredible story line and gameplay mix... great character classes and requirements sometimes pulls people out of there comfort zones of an all out shooter to try a tactical technician or a sacraficial medic but by no means making you enjoy the experience any less... i would pray for a 2nd version or an extension of this game but that is unlikely... never the less... the perfect simple, easy to grasp arcade shooter frenzy that is sometimes missing in modern games			",50,14,0,12,4,0,11

												Alien Swarm is an interesting game. Interesting in the way it plays, and the ideas behind it. When it first came out, it was expected to be a simple base for people to mod with. Not an uncommon feature for a game, since there are games just for modding like Gary's Mod. Yet, Alien Swarm didn't change that much once released. The community didn't mod it, and those that did never made much head way.But thats beside the point. The game is great for some fun times. The co-op campaign is fun, and having someone there to cover your back is nice. Aliens come from everywhere. From the vents, holes, cliffs, even a few test tubes on certain levels. You can spot some entry points easily, but always be ready to turn around and fire after a few seconds. Aliens also tend to swarm you from behind if you move too slow. The game is meant to be a run and gun through the hordes of aliens, often running back once you reach a dead end. It also offers a nice variety of aliens, from the standard minion to the hulking tanks. Each mission is unique, and always challenging when played again.The only downside is that finding a group to play with is a bit hard. While the game is free, very few people stick with it. For many it will be a simple beat the campaign, and move on game.So grab it, play it, and have some fun.			",322,54,2,99,96,4,100

												This game is amazing, I highly suggest you play it, there are many weapons to unlock, you can play with up to three of your friends, and the characters all have thier own ups and downs. The only bad things about the game are that it can be hard to find an online game due to the lack of players, and there is only one campaign that is quite short, that is not too big a problem due to being able to download campaigns off the internets, along with being able to change the difficulty in a couple ways. You can just up the difficulty, or you could make friendly fire really punishing, or turn on onslaught mode. So while the campaign may be short, you can make it challenging enough for you, or get more online. This game also has a lot of achivements, all of them fair to get with a good difficulty curve. Plus if you win two levels you get a hat in Tf2 for free, so yay.			",120,10,1,14,14,0,22

												10/10Alien Swarm is a fantastic sci-fi top down co-op adventure. Gather your fellow space marines and embark on a journey of heroics and alien obliteration. The campaign is too short, and the user made maps I've tried were not too interesting, but there are five difficulties (brutal is definitely brutal, and you'll need to make good use of a full squad), and speedrunning will keep you busy for many hours! I think it has to be the best free to play on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Edit: Sorry to say, but this game is pretty much decomposed by now. The few players still online also tend to often not be the most fun to play with people.

												Alien Swarm is pretty much an overhead version of l4d but it is a lot harder. But this game also has perks such as you can modify your own char to what it has and what it can do such as weapons and abilities also the class of the char you are using also matters since you don't want some really weak person that can't to jack on your team. When played with friends it's a whole other ball game where it becomes crazy fun and the replayablity value is all over the place not only that but this game has GMOD CONTENT. My final rating for this game is a 7/10.			",80,7,0,3,4,0,2

												I see no cons on this game, except the fact it has no off line campaign. The dynamic is great, you can easily move across the map, the controls are simple and easy. You have a large variety of things to unlock and the guns are well balanced. Add the fact that you MUST team up to survive. You can't go alone like a Rambo-like-soldier and expect to survive. Each one has a role. For instance: you can't proceed without a tech soldier; and you need another one to ""seal the doors""; a medic plus a guy who can assemble a sentry gun.It's fun it's free and it's made for us. :D			",69,5,0,10,0,0,8

												Based on The Alien movies, this is an action multiplayer game where you need to help your team to survive the aliens.You learn how to work as a team. You can also play with your friends, chat them and more.I think that this is an exelent experience of an alien invasion and It's a good game to play!			",9,0,0,1,1,0,0

												This is a extremely underrated, wonderful teamwork based survival game, and which is unfortunately abandoned with a very few amount of people still playing...sad.I really wish I had some friends willing to play this game with me, considering I finally got the PC to run it 100% effectively and I always wanted to see this game since 2010. If you might be interested, lemme know.In the meantime, check out the Firstperson version of the game that's currently in Greenlight, I think that might be a really neat way to reinvent the game!

												The game is good. This one thinks it could be scaled back, as it is near impossible to finish alone, and with others it is just as bad. Communication with other Klans is key in this game, but everybody seems to kill♥♥♥♥♥. This one has observed two types of players. There are supports and there are tanks. Neither work alone making the game very difficult, as tanking is never truly valid. One can die from a single parasite, the size of a rock, head humping you to death and you cannot shake it off. And playing as a support this one has realized is impossible alone, as you will run out of ammo very fast and one cannot carry both Med and Ammo crates. This One's final qualm, is that progression is slow. One must Grind alot if they wish to reach the end alone on anything higher than normal. This one writes it as 9/10 viewing it as an arcade game, and 6/10 as a full game. It is very short and leaves you wanting more.-1 from Arcade for Replay Value, Near Perfect for what it is. This One thinks it is at the very least sequel worthy.-4 from Full for Replay Value, Difficulty Scaling, Community, and Fairness as an SP game. One absolutely CANNOT beat this alone. Easy is possible though the jump to normal is huge. Brutal is only possible with a capable, tactical and intelligent squad. It took This One and One Other around 40 minutes to pass the first level on Brutal with half of our deaths being due to FF, so watch your sh*t because we're d*mn good shots and im not just stroking my gooch here.This one's advice: Take your time, and play it right. Never Pre-load (You lose your clip, Ammo is your life force, your Chi. It would be like using an Eve Syringe before you ran out of Adam in level of value) and Kill Everything that moves before proceeding and fall back to a choke point when it's too much. Never Rush though a level without a Timer. And Watch your fire. Friendly Fire is Brutal in this game and Death is permanent until the level ends or the squad dies. If playing solo, Rock the Ammo Crate & Tech AR for lightning grenades. This game is built to be Iron Manned. One must simply learn to Iron Man it. Float like a Butterfly, and Sting like a Bee. Sure you can play as a class with higher D, Perhaps even use a Ballistic Vest. But in the end, if One is taking damage, One is not dishing out damage, and One will have a hard time killing. If One is not taking damage, One may dish out damage, and One may kill with ease. The key, is to dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge your way to f*ckthatville because in the end, if you aren't killing them, they're killing you. Focus not on killing the enemy, but on preserving your own life, and that of the team's when online. They eventually stop spawning allowing you to ""Train"" The enemy as One would in a typical zombie game. However, One is only able to train in large areas, as many Aliens come at once. This One thinks the game's title serves it well in that aspect.			",129,24,0,12,5,0,19

												A very good game, although suffers from a few frequent crashes and lag basing off of the hosts internet connection, the game still offers high replayability, downloadable maps and campaigns as well as mods, and large amounts of loadouts that are nearly equally effective, depending on your playstyle, class, and even mood. The only major problem with this game would probably be its short amounts of players. This game used to have a lot more people playing, and now it has barely enough people to maintain a few open matches at a time. Otherwise, this is a very addictive, fun, replayable, cooperative top-down shooter that never gets old! 9/10 easy. :-)			",14,0,0,0,1,0,0

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												Alien Swarm is still my favorite multiplayer co-op game and is also the reason I created my Steam account.  In its current state, you will have to find friends to play this game with as the community is basically empty. However, back in the day, before TF2 went free to play, there were only 4ish free games on Steam and Alien Swarm was one of them. Alien Swarm could often be seen as the second most played game right after Football Manager 2011 it was da bomb and for good reasons besides being free. After Team Fortress 2 became free to play, and Valve's new Free to Play category soon after Alien Swarm slowly saw a decline in players until it had finally reached the barren state it currently is in. So if you plan on playing this, get some friends or hope that you will find a game during steam primetime.Alien Swarm can be very punishing if you make a mistake. It requires its players to stay focused, move quickly, and keep together as a team. This makes the game very difficult to new players trying to figure out how to be successful, and I've seen players never figure out how to work together and drop the game.However, when playing with other good players and finding out what you do best in the team Alien Swarm can become an extremely fun game that ends up being one of the best co-op games that I happen to know about.

												Alien Swarm is a unique game especially for that of the magnificent Source engine, as it is viewed through a top down perspective. This kind of game play style isn't experimented with or even used that much in most games, so making an entire game with this formula is quite the achievement on it's own right. The game play revolves around classes that have specific roles on the battlefield. These classes include officer, an all around class with added bonuses for the team. The special weapons, a class that uses a variety of unique and powerful weaponry to blast through the enemy. The medic, a class that is there to look out for the team with their healing capabilities. And the technical specialist, who acts as an engineer of sorts who can build structures and deal with other machinery on the map. There is also a varied amount of weapons and gear to unlock and have fun with for each class. Teamwork is a very important aspect of this game, without it you probably wont get to far before the alien bugs come for your blood. The aliens themselves have good diversity as well, with different battle styles that you will have to adapt to quickly to survive the alien threat. This is a blast with friends and if you and a friend or two are wanting a good co-op experience this is definitely a great choice.			",103,5,2,2,4,0,7

												When I first played this game. I didn't love it. But when I revisited it, It was amazing. At first the game is a little weird to get used but very easy to learn. The story is kinda weak but the missions are fun. There's alot to download in the workshop if you get bored, and some pretty intense servers as well. Overall, the game is enjoyable, has a good amount of replay value, and it's made by Valve (so it's going to be good anyway).			",52,5,0,12,3,0,2

												Well, for one, it's free, so that's definitely a plus. For another, it allows you to play Source mods without owning Half-Life 2, which is awesome. But really, Alien Swarm is a fun game to play with friends. Ignore the singleplayer mode (mostly because of the crappy AI) and you have essentially a top-down version of Left 4 Dead: Aliens Edition. Certainly not the best game available, but it's definitely worth checking out.			",740,242,1,116,60,4,125

												I think Alien Swarm is a pretty cool guy, eh kills aleins and doesn't afraid of anything.Actually though, this is a great game. Massacre aliens with up to three other people (and a lot more guns), weld doors shut to try and keep them out, cut doors open because oh-crap-you-have-to-go-back-through-there, and get butchered by the Swarm. You'll die. A lot. But it's super fun.			",40,3,0,2,11,0,16

												It is fun to play with friends , but the servers are dead . The graphics are very nice , for a 2010 game . Valve do know how to make coop games , but this one was just a commercialized product rather than something real , and I will tell you why : -- Remember those times back in 2004 when Valve launched the Source engine for the first time ? That was the time when Half Life 2 came out , and along with that , Counter Strike Source and Day of Defeat . The engine wasn't shining because it was just stealing from the PC's resources . So Valve anounced that they will improve the engine . That is how the Source SDK Base public tool was launched . It was , and still is a tool that allows the community to use the Source engine in creating mods , games , or even used to run Source-based games . To prove that it can be used , Valve launched the ""Swarm"" project , a closed and very secret project that will prove to the players that the Source engine can be fixed . So , after 3 years development and updating the SDK , Alien Swarm came out . Unfortunately , it did not last long , as it could be compared to a free and a more strategic Left 4 Dead 2 . --That is my theory . I think the game is great , and the fact that its free makes it even better . Overall , for the gameplay and graphics , but with poor level design and AI , i give this game an 8.5/10			",121,14,11,6,9,0,8

This game is about working together as a team against deadly aliens and environments. The game is basically a top down Left 4 dead (more great games) where you must complete a large set of missions to succeed. TEAMWORK is recomended. The physics of this game are amazing and the graphics r great. I HIGHLY recomend this game to top down shooter lovers because this game ROCKS!! nuff said			",34,1,0,1,7,0,5

												This game is kind of a double edged sword. I can't even imagine playing it alone or with mostly strangers. The game has nothing new to offer and the gameplay is pretty much all the same throughout the game, unless - unless you play it with your friends who are the same kinds of space, alien, sci-fi, comic books, fantasy and so on freaks as you are. Then you're gonna have a goooood time playing the game as a four-member squad in narrow corridors, snowy space stations swarmed with, well, alien swarms, you're gonna split the duties on opening the doors, downloading data, guarding the ones doing so, rescuing your friends overwhelmed and left behind, panic when those frakking little pieces of whatever you wanna call it jump on your back and poison you or your friends and you're trying to save them, watch your friend flawlessly handling a shotgun in desperate last stand of your soon-to-be gone epic squad. I wasn't expecting anything and anytime we play this we have a great time. Partly because we kind of roleplay the game when we play it, but Alien Swarm is really a enjoyable game when it comes to the multiplayer experience where you expect fun only			",213,27,9,23,14,0,27

												Interesting co-op game, because you're actually watching the scene from above... If you like co-op games, just install it and try because its free to play! And you and your friends will have a lot of fun while playing it, doing achievements and killing aliens ;).The only thing that sucks is, that there is only 1 official campaing, but don't worry! There are many nice addon campaings you can download. Have fun!			",106,16,7,11,4,0,5

An 'Aliens' rip-off but who cares it's a LOT of fun with plenty of re-playability.Decent graphics for what you need, excellent sound design, it's FREE! Makes you want to scream: ""GET SOME YOU ALIEN MOTHERF#*KERS!!!!""Only issues: 1) Can't play single player -  you must have an ally which can be tedious as not everyone will agree with your play style.2) Only one campaign available. Would love a level designer or more DLC.Game on!			",223,61,1,33,9,1,25

												Yes!!! I've been looking for good games for while, this is quite amazing! You have got to try this! An amazing top down alien shooter with lots of action. Work your way to gain weapons and new material by XP you get after a level is finshed, and one of the best part is It's Coop. Team work in essential in this game and a good team can make it out alive. Levels actually require different people for several reason. It may have a small amount of maps... much like Left 4 Dead... but it's still worth playing. Not forgetting to mention it's Free to Play! Just try it once, just once. If you don't like it at least you didn't pay for it.Rating: 7/10			",52,1,0,3,1,0,5

												A good free one by Valve for all people to play. Alien Swarm is actually based off an Unreal Tournament mod, so the game is now in Source. The game is kind of like L4D in my opinion. You're fighting waves of killer aliens with weapons. The system of leveling is an ok feature, with time spent in it to unlock more weapons and equipment. The game itself is very short, only 1 campaign in the official launch. I hope this game can pick itself up and bring more potential, it is a good game but is lacking in some features.

												An extremely fun top down 4-player co-op shooter where: (read more to see numbered list)You♥♥♥♥♥♥off other randoms by being a noobYou finished a mission without seeing much aliens on your way, wondering what on Earth is going on. Also, other(s) has/have been waiting for you at the end for centuriesYou finally were able to stick with the rush team, but you still have no idea on how were they able to rush like maze runnersYou praised a level 27 with 6 promotions who soloed ¾ of the mission when all the other teammates are deceased. Also, you realized he/she had some cool tricks up his/her sleeve when spectatingYou finally unlocked the almighty grenade launcher. You blasted yourself into giblets 3 seconds later. You made a life-time decision, 'Flameflower, I choose you!'You realized that you were left with newb weapons after you lost your promotion virginityYou learned to use (some) newb weapons competently as you had no other choice(SpongeBob voice) One year later...You get praised by playing average, soloing ¾ of the mission when all the other teammates are deceasedBonus: it is completely free.But hell, we have HELLDIVERS™ now.

Still, the game itself is pretty fun, fighting your way through them assorted outlandish beasts with fellow humans.

												Awesome game with cool effects and average graphics. And the best part of it is it's free! Why wouldn't try something that's free! It has coop which is a biggie for me but even if it didn't i'd still recomend it! One of the best free games you will ever play!9.5/10			",406,55,9,31,30,1,40

												This game is awesome. Higher difficulties are challenging, but always fun. It mostly lacks re-playability, as the same strategies tend to work despite where and when the enemy may spawn. The game is short, too short. On top of that, its free.			",263,61,17,25,22,2,42

And you and your friends will have a lot of fun while playing it, doing achievements and killing aliens ;).The only thing that sucks is, that there is only 1 official campaing, but don't worry!

												It's good for a free game, it's like Left 4 Dead with aliens. You are 4, and there are hordes incoming on you. You need to get somewhere, do something, and hold some place.(You can even add your own music to the game without replacing the default tracks in the game folders!)I miss few things in the game, something like a versus mode (like in Left 4 Dead). I want to try out the alien team against humans.If you plan to play it for longer than 30 minutes or 1 hour, download some user-made campaigns (it has only 1 campaign).Overall: 8.5/10			",48,0,0,6,0,0,5

												A great free to play game. From what i'm told the original designers gave away the game to valve for money so the game never get's any new updates. Though this may be true, that didn't stop the community from making hundreds of their own custon maps to fill in that empty space. If you keep digging you will eventually find good players. Most people who play try and get the Team Fortress 2 hat. And it is quite intertaining to get them killed and see them rage. Anyways a good and fun game. 8.5/10			",135,13,4,14,6,0,7

												It is fun to play with friends , but the servers are dead . The graphics are very nice , for a 2010 game . Valve do know how to make coop games , but this one was just a commercialized product rather than something real , and I will tell you why : -- Remember those times back in 2004 when Valve launched the Source engine for the first time ? That was the time when Half Life 2 came out , and along with that , Counter Strike Source and Day of Defeat . The engine wasn't shining because it was just stealing from the PC's resources . So Valve anounced that they will improve the engine . That is how the Source SDK Base public tool was launched . It was , and still is a tool that allows the community to use the Source engine in creating mods , games , or even used to run Source-based games . To prove that it can be used , Valve launched the ""Swarm"" project , a closed and very secret project that will prove to the players that the Source engine can be fixed . So , after 3 years development and updating the SDK , Alien Swarm came out . Unfortunately , it did not last long , as it could be compared to a free and a more strategic Left 4 Dead 2 . --That is my theory . I think the game is great , and the fact that its free makes it even better . Overall , for the gameplay and graphics , but with poor level design and AI , i give this game an 8.5/10			",121,14,11,6,9,0,8

												This ♥♥♥♥ing game had such huge potential behind it, I mean, it's a really good game, but the thing that brings it down is how short it is and the lack of official maps. This is a really good game, like all valve games, but it's largely hidden in steam now (Why can't you find it under the Free to Play category?) and there are like 2 official maps for it so the community boomed, but only for 2 weeks or so. Such a shame, such wasted potential. I would highly recommend it, even if it wasn't free; If it had more maps included with the game.			",510,87,9,35,15,4,22

												Allright now, this is a completly free game with a view from the top, you can choose from a variety of 7 missions on the official campaign and allso download unnoficial campaigns and maps made by the community which is still alive. This is a co-op game very similar to Left 4 Dead, it is the same source engine, you're objective is to slay bugs by all means of necesary. If you're looking for a game all you're friends can play and you really want to have some fun running through maps kiling hoards of alien bugs, this game is just the perfect answer to you're needs.

												An extremely fun top down 4-player co-op shooter where: (read more to see numbered list)You♥♥♥♥♥♥off other randoms by being a noobYou finished a mission without seeing much aliens on your way, wondering what on Earth is going on. Also, other(s) has/have been waiting for you at the end for centuriesYou finally were able to stick with the rush team, but you still have no idea on how were they able to rush like maze runnersYou praised a level 27 with 6 promotions who soloed ¾ of the mission when all the other teammates are deceased. Also, you realized he/she had some cool tricks up his/her sleeve when spectatingYou finally unlocked the almighty grenade launcher. You blasted yourself into giblets 3 seconds later. You made a life-time decision, 'Flameflower, I choose you!'You realized that you were left with newb weapons after you lost your promotion virginityYou learned to use (some) newb weapons competently as you had no other choice(SpongeBob voice) One year later...You get praised by playing average, soloing ¾ of the mission when all the other teammates are deceasedBonus: it is completely free.But hell, we have HELLDIVERS™ now. And no one seems to see it as the spiritual successor of Alien Swarm (or know that Alien Swarm exists). I will definitely buy it when it is on sale (if i have the mood to play by then)			",46,6,0,2,1,0,3

												This game is kind of a double edged sword. I can't even imagine playing it alone or with mostly strangers. The game has nothing new to offer and the gameplay is pretty much all the same throughout the game, unless - unless you play it with your friends who are the same kinds of space, alien, sci-fi, comic books, fantasy and so on freaks as you are. Then you're gonna have a goooood time playing the game as a four-member squad in narrow corridors, snowy space stations swarmed with, well, alien swarms, you're gonna split the duties on opening the doors, downloading data, guarding the ones doing so, rescuing your friends overwhelmed and left behind, panic when those frakking little pieces of whatever you wanna call it jump on your back and poison you or your friends and you're trying to save them, watch your friend flawlessly handling a shotgun in desperate last stand of your soon-to-be gone epic squad. I wasn't expecting anything and anytime we play this we have a great time. Partly because we kind of roleplay the game when we play it, but Alien Swarm is really a enjoyable game when it comes to the multiplayer experience where you expect fun only			",213,27,9,23,14,0,27

												This is a top down shooter to start off.Graphics: The graphics are an odd one because for a game like this, top down they are actually pretty decent and are very well presented, which weirdly makes the game decent just on that note, but we know graphics do not make a game!Audio: The audio is again fairly odd for this one, but some how it all works as one which is awesome from the odd gun sounds, so the weird mic hissing noise sounding like a radio but at the same time it does not. Controls: The controls are super super easy to use and get used too.  It's pick up and master and you got this. Game: The game has a decent amount of ranks you can get through, always levelling after max (12) and fennel resetting and getting a special tag, go 12 more and reset and getting a better badge, kinda like Titanfalls system or cods system of ranking up. Sadly the campaign is very very short and you will often want to download other creations to play to play through, but even they are short too. So this game is short at best. There are some great difficulties to choose from and if you want to push then insane/ hoard... You will run out of ammo before the first door and why this is made is beyond me. The game is coop which is awesome, seriously awesome, you'll see alone in this game is boring. Also the game is free to play so how can you pass this up....Would I recommend? Yes why not it's an easy few hours of fun			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

												Pretty good game that requires teamwork and encourages comms. Friendly fire will eat your team alive if everyone's firing blindly, whereas having each person dedicated to defending an angle keeps you alive. Run and gun gets you killed, moving up with your team slowly gets everyone through the level alive. Full-auto eats through all your ammo, burst fire gives you just more than enough.A bit short, but every level is worth it. Only negative was its length. ",109,6,4,9,10,0,6

												Really nice game! First off, I think it's one of the most overlooked games (most likely because it's free so people instantly assume it's mediocre quality). The downside to this game is that you only get half of the experience if you play alone. Playing with friends is way more interesting because each player can focus on his own role, allowing the others to specialize in something else, compared to playing alone where you have to be your own medic and your own engineer... so on. It's quite a difficult game when you pay it the first time because it's going to be tricky to figure out what you have to do (which is not bad) but it might be slightly frustrating especially if you play with friends, you die and you have to start form the beginning. There is a fair amount of variety when it comes to alien enemies and the game keeps throwing new things at you constantly, also graphic wise it looks quite good for a top down shooter, especially when a team member dies and the camera zooms on him and dramatically showcases his death in slow motion.That being said, once you get the hang of it, you will feel amazing cooperating with the other players and playing quite strategically.This game gets a thumbs up form me.. and I should play it again.

												amazing co op game. it can get really tough so its good to rely on your teamates and stick together. different classes to choose from and a wide selection of gun and epuipment. overall i would rate this game a 7/10 it could have used more campaigns and more tasks to complete such as the computer hacking. it would have been nice to see character customization but for being a free game i guess we got all we could ask for.  definitely worth having though.

Though I'm not huge into the space genre, I was able to play with some cool people to help me reach the 100% achievement. This game is basically a team of space marines fighting monsters doing missions. Each marine can have a different load out and specialty, which you get more weapons while leveling up. If you like a top down humans vs zombies game, this is definitely for you. For myself, glad it's completed. :p			",108,29,0,23,8,0,5

This is a really good game, like all valve games, but it's largely hidden in steam now (Why can't you find it under the Free to Play category?) and there are like 2 official maps for it so the community boomed, but only for 2 weeks or so. Such a shame, such wasted potential. I would highly recommend it, even if it wasn't free; If it had more maps included with the game.			",510,87,9,35,15,4,22

												A great free to play game. From what i'm told the original designers gave away the game to valve for money so the game never get's any new updates. Though this may be true, that didn't stop the community from making hundreds of their own custon maps to fill in that empty space. If you keep digging you will eventually find good players. Most people who play try and get the Team Fortress 2 hat. And it is quite intertaining to get them killed and see them rage. Anyways a good and fun game. 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If this game was a first person shooter, I'd play it as much as Left 4 Dead 2. It's that good. Valve really threw me for a loop, releasing this game for free and then never following up with a first person update. Regardless of what anyone thinks, Valve is the easily the greatest multiplayer co-op developer in the history of gaming and in saying that, it makes no sense that this game isn't first person. They've managed to do something that not even FOX could do; make an Aliens game that had you sweating from beginning to end. Bring on the true FPS version!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But it's also very fun when played with friends, the combat has a great frantic feeling that gets your heart pumping and your finger twitching, while trying not to kill your comrades. It's very short and only has one level, though I think you can download maps from a third party site or through the workshop possibly. It's definitely worth a download and at least a few play throughs with friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An extremely fun top down 4-player co-op shooter where: (read more to see numbered list)You♥♥♥♥♥♥off other randoms by being a noobYou finished a mission without seeing much aliens on your way, wondering what on Earth is going on. Also, other(s) has/have been waiting for you at the end for centuriesYou finally were able to stick with the rush team, but you still have no idea on how were they able to rush like maze runnersYou praised a level 27 with 6 promotions who soloed ¾ of the mission when all the other teammates are deceased. Also, you realized he/she had some cool tricks up his/her sleeve when spectatingYou finally unlocked the almighty grenade launcher. You blasted yourself into giblets 3 seconds later. You made a life-time decision, 'Flameflower, I choose you!'You realized that you were left with newb weapons after you lost your promotion virginityYou learned to use (some) newb weapons competently as you had no other choice(SpongeBob voice) One year later...You get praised by playing average, soloing ¾ of the mission when all the other teammates are deceasedBonus: it is completely free.But hell, we have HELLDIVERS™ now. And no one seems to see it as the spiritual successor of Alien Swarm (or know that Alien Swarm exists). I will definitely buy it when it is on sale (if i have the mood to play by then)			",46,6,0,2,1,0,3

												This is a top down shooter to start off.Graphics: The graphics are an odd one because for a game like this, top down they are actually pretty decent and are very well presented, which weirdly makes the game decent just on that note, but we know graphics do not make a game!Audio: The audio is again fairly odd for this one, but some how it all works as one which is awesome from the odd gun sounds, so the weird mic hissing noise sounding like a radio but at the same time it does not. Controls: The controls are super super easy to use and get used too.  It's pick up and master and you got this. Game: The game has a decent amount of ranks you can get through, always levelling after max (12) and fennel resetting and getting a special tag, go 12 more and reset and getting a better badge, kinda like Titanfalls system or cods system of ranking up. Sadly the campaign is very very short and you will often want to download other creations to play to play through, but even they are short too. So this game is short at best. There are some great difficulties to choose from and if you want to push then insane/ hoard... You will run out of ammo before the first door and why this is made is beyond me. The game is coop which is awesome, seriously awesome, you'll see alone in this game is boring. Also the game is free to play so how can you pass this up....Would I recommend? Yes why not it's an easy few hours of fun			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

They even have places where you can download campaigns for this. It's too bad it isn't with steam workshop, as that would have so many interesting and awesome maps made.Play this damn game.

												Alien Swarm is a super team-based game with many weapons and funny extras. The main game has only one campaign with seven missions, but they are very intense and if you are finished with them, you toggle the difficulty for a harder challenge. And if the story went boring, you can play on dedicated servers and play custom campaigns from other players for more fun.In fact, for a free game a very impressive experience with great gameplay and much more aliens.

												This game is free, so I guess you can't beat that price. There are still some shortcomings, but again...it's free. The campaign it comes with is pretty short and can be beat in a few hours, but it's still pretty fun to play through, and each level is really well done. You can download other custom maps too, or create your own with the SDK it comes with.Gameplay wise, it's pretty simple but I think it's effective. Movement is tight, and there is a good variance in enemies and weapons. Some of the achievements were a pain but still fun to get. I'd give it a 6.5/10. I think it's a really decent game, but it could have been so much more if Valve put in the effort to make it available for OS X and Linux, and pushed Workshop for it.			",110,27,2,7,1,0,5

												Alien Swarm is a tactical squad-based survival game with a decent progression system. The roles in it are: Leader, Medic, Tech, and Special Weapons. The loadouts are limited. The options can feel endless. Some areas are dark. Some areas are harmful. Some aliens are harmful. Some aliens are REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING HARMFUL. There are also certain elements in it that require Medics and Techs. When someone dies, they stay dead until after everyone alive gets to extraction or everyone dies. It can be very easy to die. Simply being serperated in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spot can lead to being surrounded in a corner while reloading and a very quick and painful death. Some say being eaten alive is a rare delicacy in some cultures. Others say that that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and being eaten alive is ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying. Anyways, Alien Swarm is free to play. ",179,7,0,9,11,0,23

												Really nice game! First off, I think it's one of the most overlooked games (most likely because it's free so people instantly assume it's mediocre quality). The downside to this game is that you only get half of the experience if you play alone. Playing with friends is way more interesting because each player can focus on his own role, allowing the others to specialize in something else, compared to playing alone where you have to be your own medic and your own engineer... so on. It's quite a difficult game when you pay it the first time because it's going to be tricky to figure out what you have to do (which is not bad) but it might be slightly frustrating especially if you play with friends, you die and you have to start form the beginning. There is a fair amount of variety when it comes to alien enemies and the game keeps throwing new things at you constantly, also graphic wise it looks quite good for a top down shooter, especially when a team member dies and the camera zooms on him and dramatically showcases his death in slow motion.That being said, once you get the hang of it, you will feel amazing cooperating with the other players and playing quite strategically.This game gets a thumbs up form me.. and I should play it again.

												Le jeu est gratuit et plonge les joueurs dans une chasse aux aliens en coopération où il faudra agir avec stratégie.Formez un groupe de choc et utilisez de nombreuses armes.Un petit régal pour les fans de SF des premiers temps...Les graphismes du jeu sont vraiment beaux, les textures et les effets sont convaincants.Une bande son de bonne qualité, des bruitages et les voix des marines dans le ton.Jouabilité intuitive et nerveuse assez facile à prendre en main pour n'importe quel débutant.Le mode coopération n'invente rien de nouveau, mais il est très bien réalisé.Ajoutez à cela une marge de progression bien réelle et l'apport stratégique de la co-op avec ses quatre classes bien balancées (médecin, ingénieur, gros bras et as en explosifs), vous obtenez un must-have.Un jeu qui, dans ses mécaniques, n'est pas sans rappeler un doux mélange de Left 4 Dead, Alien Breed et Diablo.Cette virée spatiale est faite pour vous gratuitement et en CO-OP.18/20			",378,68,11,30,5,2,24

												Hello Fellow Marines,Alien Swarm is an interesting game at that. The teamwork concept seems like a wonderful idea! I love how the team has their specific roles, it's a very strategy driven game which makes it all the more fun! Unfortunately, if you aren't playing the game with friends only, it can be extremely chaotic. I've had several teams where people just kill me or refuse to chase the objective. I have a mixed feeling about the community, but the game itself is a wonderful concept. For free, I'd recommend getting this game with a few friends, you'll enjoy it! Without friends, it gets fairly annoying entering public lobbies. Overall, I recommend Alien Swarm!-Kyle James			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alien Swarm is a free game.Alien Swarm is a free game with no microtransactions.Alien Swarm is a free game by Valve.Alien Swarm is a great game.If you like class-based cooperative games you should definitely try out Alien Swarm. It starts you off with strong enough basic gear and as you play and level up you gain access to more variety. There is only one official campaign, but the Steam Workshop has that little flaw covered.Definitely give this one a try and play with your friends.			",285,124,4,44,27,4,28

												Everyone who has ever played starcraft will understand what I mean when I say ""Zerg rush."" That's what you're fighting through: A constant, sudden stream of aliens intent on killing the woefully outnumbered (and squishy) Space Marines. Several classes to play with from the start, and an impressive armory to unlock as you level up, means you can play however you see fit. At the impressive cost of nil, and with the exuberant community putting out new material, I have no issues reccommending this game to everyone who'll listen.The only down-side to this game is the random players thrown in. A surprising number of them tend towards the aggressive side of things, and there's a lot of Last-Man-On-Earth posturing. Open-mic is useful, though. Allows everyone to communicate as they need to in order to complete the objectives of each stage. By all means: go for it!			",77,19,1,15,4,0,10

												Alien Swarm is the quintessential Free-to-Play Steam Game and is one of the few 4-Player Co-Op games that can offer both the difficulty of the old-school while successfully maintaining the look of a newer-gen game. The difficulty scales depending on how many are in your party, and in my opinion, so does the amount of fun! Really the only thing I feel might be missing is expansions or custom stories. Despite the lack of expansions or custom stories, the ability to change diffuclty offers a replayability factor that will be more than a challenge for you and your friends. Bottom Line:This game will provide many hours of entertainment and should be played in a group for the full effect. If you have not played this game, download it now!

Что бы пройти миссию вам с корешами нужно договорится о какой-нибудь тактике.Очень интересно и зрелищно играть хотя бы в троем .Да и вообще игре стоит уделить внимание , хотя бы потому что она бесплатная.

												One of the best top down first person shooters out there. This game is intended to be played as coop for up to 4 players, each player can pick different classes and choose equipment in every mission, resulting in a huge variety of tactics and splitting of domains. As you complete missions you gain more experience and level up to get more equipment and skills (the better you play, the faster you level up). Both weapons and items offer a huge diversity and a load of fun.The atmosphere is brilliant and leaves no room for wishes and the game offers more content than most games do nowadays (I would be still playing if there would be more content.).

												Easily the best 4 player Co-op shooters I've ever played (and one of the few out there really).It features great map designs, enemies, weapons and makes you rely on teamwork like never before.On top of that, it's free.I've had a blast playing this game with 3 other friends and I wish there were more games like this.However the main campaign, despite being awesome, is very short. And after you've completed it once, there isn't much else to do that re-doing it on a harder difficulty. There are some people out there who have made a couple of custom maps long ago, but the community in general died out. The lack of Workshop doesn't help either. All we can hope for now is that Valve revives the game with new campaigns or makes a sequel.In short: One of the best Co-op games out there and it's free. Definatly worth gathering some friends and giving it a try.			",132,6,5,10,11,0,15

												Alien Swarm is the quintessential Free-to-Play Steam Game and is one of the few 4-Player Co-Op games that can offer both the difficulty of the old-school while successfully maintaining the look of a newer-gen game. The difficulty scales depending on how many are in your party, and in my opinion, so does the amount of fun! Really the only thing I feel might be missing is expansions or custom stories. Despite the lack of expansions or custom stories, the ability to change diffuclty offers a replayability factor that will be more than a challenge for you and your friends. Bottom Line:This game will provide many hours of entertainment and should be played in a group for the full effect. If you have not played this game, download it now!

												I used to hate this game. Then it grew on me. It's super simplistic and quick. Shooty shooty bang bang~ Aliens are dead. You win. Repeat until all rounds are done. At least that's how it is abridged and if you are good enough to clear each mission. But it's easy to pick up and learn so you can get good enough fairly quickly. The nice (or worst depending on the kind've player you are) thing about this game is that you don't necessarily need teamwork to beat the mission. You can hang behind, go ahead, make your character spin in circles and you and your team can still make it out fine. Now I don't know what happens if you all decide to spin in circles but at that point, y'all shouldn't be playing this and instead should go ride a merry-go-round. So should you play this FPS? Yeah. Sure. Why not?			",291,151,3,49,36,4,35

												This game is fairly amazing for a free game! When I first started playing it I almost gave it a 'Not Recommended' due to the fact it was near impossible to find anyone willing to play. I tried and tried and decided to give it one final shot which finally rewarded me with a playable game! When we finally got in game I had a great time though blasting my way through aliens and trying to keep my teammates alive.Keep in mind it seems that Valve has abandoned this game. Understandable seeing as they weren't really making any kind of money out of it though. You're not going to find any DLC unless you search for community mods even though the story seems to have alot more to it. It's also very hard to find any other players that actually care about the achievements, if you're into that. The game is good for a few play-throughs but it's fairly unplayable if you're trying to go beyond normal mode or trying for any group achievements.Still, the game is free, so you can't really go wrong! 3/5			",914,392,15,94,73,11,147

												It's a really cool game. Unfortunately it is rather short only has one campaign that can be finished in under an hour. ofc you can grind that one campaign until you hate the game. But it's free and fun with friends. Give it a shotps: try the hardest difficulty settings with a couple of friends, get ready for 2 hours of non-stop laughter.			",66,1,6,3,7,2,10

												Dota 2 is using this game's engine. HOW FANTASTIC!..*cough*This game is pretty good, i think. Just like in Left 4 Dead, you play with 3 players (and if you count yourself, 4ps)You have to break down security doors that may have been broken, while killing those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aliens.Pretty good game. Did I mention if you play a few more with this game, you will acquire something in TF2 if you unlocked an Achievement?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It may look easy, but this game is quite difficult, which is where the fun lies. This is how it works. A four man team made of different people who have their own skills (such as a medic who can deploy a med-kit or flares). They then go in on an objective based mission, in which there are aliens to kill and whatnot. Gadgets are spread around the place, such as welders, and sentries. Things can to hell in a handbasket quick. Aliens come from everywhere, and boy are they quick. Ammo isn't easy to find. Once a teammate is dead, they are gone. Friendly fire is a pain in the butt, so watch where you aim. There are events in which you must surive an unending horde for a time. It's basically a top-down Left 4 Dead, but it's different. As a bonus, one achivement earn you a hat in Team Fortress 2! Yay! HAT. YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT.			",112,7,2,4,3,0,4

												I used to hate this game. Then it grew on me. It's super simplistic and quick. Shooty shooty bang bang~ Aliens are dead. You win. Repeat until all rounds are done. At least that's how it is abridged and if you are good enough to clear each mission. But it's easy to pick up and learn so you can get good enough fairly quickly. The nice (or worst depending on the kind've player you are) thing about this game is that you don't necessarily need teamwork to beat the mission. You can hang behind, go ahead, make your character spin in circles and you and your team can still make it out fine. Now I don't know what happens if you all decide to spin in circles but at that point, y'all shouldn't be playing this and instead should go ride a merry-go-round. So should you play this FPS? Yeah. Sure. Why not?			",291,151,3,49,36,4,35

												Everyone who has ever played starcraft will understand what I mean when I say ""Zerg rush."" That's what you're fighting through: A constant, sudden stream of aliens intent on killing the woefully outnumbered (and squishy) Space Marines. Several classes to play with from the start, and an impressive armory to unlock as you level up, means you can play however you see fit. At the impressive cost of nil, and with the exuberant community putting out new material, I have no issues reccommending this game to everyone who'll listen.The only down-side to this game is the random players thrown in. A surprising number of them tend towards the aggressive side of things, and there's a lot of Last-Man-On-Earth posturing. Open-mic is useful, though. Allows everyone to communicate as they need to in order to complete the objectives of each stage. By all means: go for it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily the best 4 player Co-op shooters I've ever played (and one of the few out there really).It features great map designs, enemies, weapons and makes you rely on teamwork like never before.On top of that, it's free.I've had a blast playing this game with 3 other friends and I wish there were more games like this.However the main campaign, despite being awesome, is very short. And after you've completed it once, there isn't much else to do that re-doing it on a harder difficulty. There are some people out there who have made a couple of custom maps long ago, but the community in general died out. The lack of Workshop doesn't help either. All we can hope for now is that Valve revives the game with new campaigns or makes a sequel.In short: One of the best Co-op games out there and it's free. Definatly worth gathering some friends and giving it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not at all my type of game, but from what i could tell, those that are interested in the genre will find alot of pleasure in Alien Swarm.

												Good game.  Sadly Valve has never added anything to the game since release.  The game is very challenging, dying on easy is pretty easy even with friends, depending on which mission you are on.  The screams of aliens add a little bit of horror too.  Get the game if you have friends.  You can get a TF2 hat out of this too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An interesting co-op top down shooter, in the style of Smash-TV, heavily influenced by Aliens and Starship Troopers, with shades of Left 4 Dead. The recently released PS-Exclusive Helldivers looks like a direct clone of this game.As of this writing, the community is quite thin.  One 7-mission campaign is available for free, with lots of community levels floating around, but no official content was ever released. Co-op multi-player games like this live and die by map rotations, and years of no official maps have very much killed the player base.A stock levelling system controls weapon availability, and many interesting weapons make repeated missions interesting. An early update enabled repeating the 27 levels with higher EXP requirements, but this just makes the grind to unlock weapons more grindy.  A free and very fun game, not without it's blemishes, but definitely worth the time and attention but try to bring 3 friends along, as finding random to play with is a lost cause.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you love a top-down Left 4 Dead style shooter with emphasis on teamwork and communication, plus some small hacking minigames and an actual purpose to keep the medic alive (parasites), this is a great game to play.

												As far as free games go, this is a really good one to kill some time with a few friends while you're waiting on someone/something.  Doesn't have a lot of longevity, so don't expect to put more than a couple hours into it, but there are several different character classes and weapons to unlock in this third-person, top down, action/adventure shooter.Pros:Fun, Addictive GameplayFreeWell PolishedCons:No real staying power (outside of SDK, if you're into that)It's free, so download it and give it a shot.  I recommend playing with a friend or two as teamwork is a vital part of this fun little game.  B-			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alien Swarm for unreal tournament 2004 was quite a unique type of game back in those times. Valve most certainly did not make a mistake by hiring the same team who made the previously mentioned mod to create a very impressive remake using the Source Engine. Despite the short campaign and a vaguely explained storyline, the game offers loads of fun in cooperative missions which can range from 2 to even 8 players in certain servers. It's also free, so there are always lots of servers to play on. The replay value is infinite, as your skills improve, so do your standards, and this game offers quite a few challenging settings.

												A Valve-made ""free"" co-op TPS in which up to 4 players play against a horde of aliens. A hat for ""Team Fortress 2"" wearable by all classes can be obtained by completing 2 co-op missions online. It's very fun to play with team though you'll have great trouble finding mates unless you have some friends to play...co-op mode is almost dead! :( Remember not to reload until you run out of ammo in the clip or remaining ammo in that clip will be lost. Despite its potential, there's just 1 campaign, no support for Steam Workshop...this is the most underappreciated of all Valve's game.(Japanese translation below)==================================================エイリアンの大群相手に戦う、最大4人まで参加可能なValve製の無料で遊べる協力プレイ型TPS。co-opモードで2ステージを攻略するとTeam Fortress 2で全クラスが使える帽子が貰えます。かなりの過疎状態でフレンドを呼ばない限りチームを組むのは困難ですが、チームさえ組めれば大いに楽しめます。リロードの度に弾倉内の残弾が消滅する仕様なので撃ち尽くすまでリロードは控えましょう。ゲームとして発展できる余地があるにも関わらずキャンペーンは1つ、ワークショップにも非対応というValve作品の中で最も不遇な扱いを受けている作品です。			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its pretty fun but and gets harder slowly unlikely some games that have a a spike of difficulty. Its cool that you can play as 4 classes and you shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game is best played with 4 people or better yet four freinds because the later levels get pretty hard.

												First off: This is an excellent top-down, coop shooter.Get a few friends together (there is a matchmaking kind of thing going on, but in europe it's populated mostly by russians) and play through the missions that are there.After that you could ramp up the difficulty, but other than that there's not much more to it sadly.The game was released ""as is"" and then abandoned. It won't get any more love from Valve.As I said at the top, it IS a great game, and if you haven't played it yet and you are into coop shooters, you should at least play through what is available.

												In all honesty, I downloaded this for a free hat.It turned out to be much better than I thought it would. The levels are thought out very well, and flow nicely, but they do it while keeping you on edge, and the difficulty high.This is really fun if you have at least 2 players. The only thing I really dislike is the team killing, there's no way to disable it. Even though it could be funny to kill your team mates once in a while, sometimes it gets annoying when we finally decide to play the game properly.I would highly recommend this game though, runs great, and it's more addicting than it seems it would be. It doesn't have tons of content, which is probably why this is free, but if they added a few more missions this could easily be worth some money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												QUICK AND SHORT REVIEWAlien Swarm is a game abandoned by Valve, just because it didn't make profit.The gameplay is good, even though it gets boring pretty quick (2-3 hours).Not surprising, for a 2 GB game, that had almost no updates to it.Do I recommend this game ?YES, but even then, you need to have the bots, because the community for this game is dead.How may you spawn them ?Here's the command: ""cl_selectm <0-7> -1"" where 0-7 is the marine you want, and -1 is ""next slot"".

												It is very sad this game simply did not get the post-release support it deserved. The game is effectively a top-down L4D style co-op shooter, but with aliens. In fact it runs on the Source engine and was made by Valve developers who worked on L4D. The gameplay is fantastic and even has an unlock system with loads of weapons and gear to unlock, as well as player classes like the heavy and medic. The base game has only one campaign and not a true solo experience (You can only play 1 level of the campaign in singleplayer). But, there is a map-pack on the forum of this game that add's loads of community campaigns from the games now dead mod site, as well as being able to play all levels in singleplayer.This game is totally free, not any of that F2P crap and is very fun, with a good load of maps to get, so really, there is no reason to not have this game.

												I used to play this game non-stop, and I'm not sure if anything's been done to it to fix the problem that caused me to quit playing over a year ago. The AI teammates were pretty nicely programmed and I enjoyed having a team at my disposal even when nobody else was online to help me, the only problem I really had was heavy crashing and overall lag during lift rides or graphical moments like explosions. From over a year ago I'd rate it 7/10, because it did still have some shorthand problems ontop of it all and I can't be too biased and focused on the AI teammates.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game, can said that it was one of the best F2P Co-op game ever played. Played with 2 other friends, called Sara and Zhi Xiang.Sara walk into an acid pool i guess and died in one of the missions. After a few games we went back to play the same mission. Despite being warned, and he said that he knows that there is an acid pool he was laughing at his pervious mistake and walk into the acid pool again. 30/10Zhi Xiang, always our tech guy. Helped us to hack and open the door and we killed him for the first time. He was cursing us.Second mission i was the only♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ which waited him to hack the door and when the door almost open, i killed him, and he quit the game and being mad at me. -20/10 friendship partially ruined.Is your choice guys. :D Awesome game!

I am hoping that this will soon have steam workshop to make more campaigns or maybr valve will step it up and make this game mroe awesome.

												I downloaded this game to get the hat in TF2... I'm not gonna uninstall it, I really want to play through the game, it's actually quite fun and challenging. The only downside, this game is really, really dead. I have not found a single game in multiplayer, I have to ask friends to play it all the time.It reminds me of GREED: Black border, which is another game I liked. I mean, this game is free and not pay to win, just try it and enjoy it!			",1385,503,40,149,121,21,186

												A must play for any moba, shooting, action games or even any open minded person.Replayability is insane, since you acquire new weapons as you get rank but must reset your acquisitions to increase in ranks and change badges.Difficulty settings actually matter and definetly makes things waaaay more interesting. It changes the game from a casual park stroll to must. dodge. sulfuric-acid-rain-drops.extremely addicting. Simple mechanics, making it a simple to learn yet hard and fun to master. The only downside is the continually low amount of players to play with and the lack of content.I would definetly pay to see this game get more content and keep going... So on a positive side, yea sure its free... but once you play and love it you realize that being free is a negative point.			",145,22,2,25,13,1,34

												When they lauchned this title, it was pretty damn popular for a while. Right now, as far as i can tell, the multiplayer is pretty much dead but if you can bring friends with you you'll definitely have a blast. The game is basically a 4-players coop overhead shooter where you have to complete several linear missions that you can replay whenever you want. There are multiple difficulty level and i can tell you that the highest difficulties really are awfully hard so no matter how good you are at the game you can still make it challenging. There are 4 different classes, each of them feature 2 playable characters (for a total of 8 characters) that have different stats as well as some unique perks and items based on their class. There is a progression system where by you get experience for every mission you play and unlock stuff as you level up. Getting to the maximum level really isn't much of a challenge but the game features a prestige system (as far as i can remember, prestiging doesn't give you any advantage whatsoever but i might be wrong). The game does have its flaws, for example I would say that the level design is fairly weak as the missions are extremely linear and you're usually not rewarded at all for exploring. Also, the game is obviously not meant to be played by a team of less than 4 people, you will have a hard time if your team is not full. That is about it in terms of bad stuff i have to say about the game, which is very surprising considering this is a free-to-play game with no microtransaction at all, meaning it does not make any money whatsoever. The developpers also did a very good job with the combat, it feels very very good and the game handles every aspect of it very well. While I'm at it, I must praise the fact that fighting aliens that are below or above you is done very, very easily, which is something that most 3D overhead shooters don't do well at all.Overall a very solid game that you don't have to spend a penny on, in fact you CAN'T spend money on it. You definitely won't find an awful lot of people online but play it with friend. You'll all have an awesome moment. No really, I'm serious, download it and enjoy it. NOW.			",298,71,10,42,45,4,28

												Divertido, adictivo y genial. Estos 3 adjetivos son los que encuentro más adecuados para describir este juego sin mesionar tambien que es Gratis. En lo general se destaca un modo de juego muy llamativo y divertido, la jugabilidad es un punto  muy fuerte en este juego y en lo que respecta a sonido y soundtracks no hay mucho que decir la verdad, a mi criterio  me parece que es normal.En lo que en realidad se destaca este juego es en la facilidad para divertir ""Si se tiene 3 compañeros con los cuales jugar"". Una vez tengas un grupo armado y listo para jugar el resto es historia. Las misiones, personajes, roles estan muy bien pensadas. En el juego hay luegar para toda clase de estrategias, desde la ""Rambo"" asi le llamo yo a avanzar como loco  matando todo a su paso hasta la más estrategica.En resumen si eres un jugador que le gusta lo diferente, divertido y porque no gratis este es el juego definitivamente.Le doy un 4.0/5.0			",176,15,7,9,10,0,8

												Very addictive, challenging game, where Coop is the key. You start slow and carefuly and later you are good enough to rush through the maps like crazy. But after you've played it for a very, very long time it gets really repetitive. Unfortunately the Devs have abondoned it and there is no officially content to expect anymore. Otherwise it would still be one of the Top 10 games.			",324,169,3,25,13,2,15

												When they lauchned this title, it was pretty damn popular for a while. Right now, as far as i can tell, the multiplayer is pretty much dead but if you can bring friends with you you'll definitely have a blast. The game is basically a 4-players coop overhead shooter where you have to complete several linear missions that you can replay whenever you want. There are multiple difficulty level and i can tell you that the highest difficulties really are awfully hard so no matter how good you are at the game you can still make it challenging. There are 4 different classes, each of them feature 2 playable characters (for a total of 8 characters) that have different stats as well as some unique perks and items based on their class. There is a progression system where by you get experience for every mission you play and unlock stuff as you level up. Getting to the maximum level really isn't much of a challenge but the game features a prestige system (as far as i can remember, prestiging doesn't give you any advantage whatsoever but i might be wrong). The game does have its flaws, for example I would say that the level design is fairly weak as the missions are extremely linear and you're usually not rewarded at all for exploring. Also, the game is obviously not meant to be played by a team of less than 4 people, you will have a hard time if your team is not full. That is about it in terms of bad stuff i have to say about the game, which is very surprising considering this is a free-to-play game with no microtransaction at all, meaning it does not make any money whatsoever. The developpers also did a very good job with the combat, it feels very very good and the game handles every aspect of it very well. While I'm at it, I must praise the fact that fighting aliens that are below or above you is done very, very easily, which is something that most 3D overhead shooters don't do well at all.Overall a very solid game that you don't have to spend a penny on, in fact you CAN'T spend money on it. You definitely won't find an awful lot of people online but play it with friend. You'll all have an awesome moment. No really, I'm serious, download it and enjoy it. NOW.			",298,71,10,42,45,4,28

												When they lauchned this title, it was pretty damn popular for a while. Right now, as far as i can tell, the multiplayer is pretty much dead but if you can bring friends with you you'll definitely have a blast. The game is basically a 4-players coop overhead shooter where you have to complete several linear missions that you can replay whenever you want. There are multiple difficulty level and i can tell you that the highest difficulties really are awfully hard so no matter how good you are at the game you can still make it challenging. There are 4 different classes, each of them feature 2 playable characters (for a total of 8 characters) that have different stats as well as some unique perks and items based on their class. There is a progression system where by you get experience for every mission you play and unlock stuff as you level up. Getting to the maximum level really isn't much of a challenge but the game features a prestige system (as far as i can remember, prestiging doesn't give you any advantage whatsoever but i might be wrong). The game does have its flaws, for example I would say that the level design is fairly weak as the missions are extremely linear and you're usually not rewarded at all for exploring. Also, the game is obviously not meant to be played by a team of less than 4 people, you will have a hard time if your team is not full. That is about it in terms of bad stuff i have to say about the game, which is very surprising considering this is a free-to-play game with no microtransaction at all, meaning it does not make any money whatsoever. The developpers also did a very good job with the combat, it feels very very good and the game handles every aspect of it very well. While I'm at it, I must praise the fact that fighting aliens that are below or above you is done very, very easily, which is something that most 3D overhead shooters don't do well at all.Overall a very solid game that you don't have to spend a penny on, in fact you CAN'T spend money on it. You definitely won't find an awful lot of people online but play it with friend. You'll all have an awesome moment. No really, I'm serious, download it and enjoy it. NOW.			",298,71,10,42,45,4,28

												Coop alien killing game ""COOL RIGHT?!?!?!""In short ""meh""The game is a coop over head view shooter in which u and and other marines are tasked with shooting your way threw aliens to get to and complete your objectives.Thats the idea.You get a coop over head view shooter where one guy is the ""VIP MISSION CRITICAL ENGIE, PROTECT HIM OR YOU LOSE"" macguffin (he has to hack abot 3 or so consoles excusive to only him that block your progress) and a good example that friendly fire isnt (you will find yourself killing your allys in the crossfire almost as much as the aliens.Though if u bring competent friends u can avoid constant ff incidents and protect each other effectlly (but mostly the fragile engie) u will have a good time.In short: Bring friends, have fun. :D			",173,9,0,18,3,2,7

Yet with just a single map i believe they could update it with at least a few more. It deserves it. Please Valve come back to this game and update it. It's too good to be forgotten.
