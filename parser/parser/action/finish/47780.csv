												9.5/10genre : 3rd person action with horror elements The game takes place 3 years after the events of the first game and you play as Isaac Clarke fighting from the very first moment of the game for your life in a space station known as the Sprawl, haunted by things no man should ever have seen and by the  fact that your girlfriend died on Ishimura.+ Great presentation and graphical detail, great use of light that amplfies the atmosphere, Isaac looks great. Game runs with no problems maxed out.+ Voice acting is fine, sound effects are also great, you will often wonder if that sound is a monster creeping up on you or just a piece of metal rolling around.+ Gameplay wise the combat is more satisfying than in the original and melee is also done better.  There are some new weapon additions , but the plasma cutter and pulse rifle are still your best bet just as they were in the first game.+ Nice idea with the space suit, that implements interesting gameplay elements.+ Some clever puzzles, although not that challenging.+ Hard Core mode is unlocked after you finish the game at least once and in addition to tougher enemies and fewer supplies, you can save your progress only 3 times.- Game is faster paced than the original, maybe faster than what a horror game should be.- After a while enemies become predictable, both the way they appear and the way they fight.- Multiplayer is nothing special. A classic action/horror game , a beautiful single player experience, even though it's a linear and after a while a predictable one, a game i recommend to everyone who is looking for a solid single player and intense experience.

												Dead Space 2 is amazing. It takes everything the original put into the series, and enhances it. The controls are more precise, smooth and convenient (with the addition of a single button health and stasis refill system), the visuals are even more detailed and gritty, the sound is as creepy as ever, and the story remains intriguing and intense. You must work to unravel the truth behind the Sprawl (the game's setting), Unitology and Necromorphs, as well as battling (literally) horrific hallucinations and delusions from an alien form of dementia. If you are a fan of the first, then you will definitely enjoy this.While the base game mechanics are not terribly different from many over-the-shoulder style third person shooters, several aspects are worth mentioning. One of the hallmarks of Dead Space 2 is that it forces players to use weapons to defeat enemies in a different way. In a time when headshots are the gold standard for 99% of games, Dead Space 2 requires players to sever limbs in order to defeat enemies--well-placed head shots will get you nowhere. This is a refreshing change of pace, as the dismemberment strategy will change based on enemy type (there are several), and thus every battle becomes much more tactical. There are also a wide variety of unique weapons to choose from, and each weapon will serve a different purpose in your arsenal, depending on how you want to fine tune your Necromorph killing strategy. Puzzles are frequent enough to serve as welcome breaks from the tense action, but not too frequent to become annoying.Atmosphere was my main draw to DS1 and now DS2. Visceral Games has managed to create this incredibly immersive environment that manages to literally keep me trying to be prepared for what they may throw at me next. In my opinion, the number one contributor to creating such an unrivaled level of atmosphere is the sound design. Anyone who plays this game owes it to themselves to have it on a good home theater system or at least some good quality headphones. The surround sound not only adds to the spookiness of the game, but delivers vital information of approaching creatures. Even in areas with no baddies to kill, the sounds of metallic creaks, cracks and scrapes in the Sprawl's ventilation system let you know you're never safe. Indeed DS2 has some cheap scares, but they're so well timed and not always predictable that I have a hard time believing someone who says they never jumped during a play through.The music is well composed, and only adds to the atmosphere. The music is also well timed and sometimes gives you the impression that something large is coming. Sometimes it never happens, while other times it does. It manages to build levels of tension and keep you on your toes, never taking for granted the next dark hallway, for a necro is commonly waiting in unseen corners.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Dead Space 2. One does not have to be familiar with the first to enjoy this, as there is a ""Previous on Dead Space"" menu option available to bring newcomers up to par; however, to get the most from the story, I would highly recommend it.

												It has you checking every corpse in sight with a ranged gunshot to make sure that they're not going to reanimate and slice your body apart.The horror within this game cannot be described with mere words, videos and images are enough to keep you on edge, but being inside the game immerses you to the point where you almost emulate the fear that the player is enduring, a truly shocking experience.

You play as Isaac Clarke in the aftermath of Dead Space 1's events, you are lead to believe that you have a mental issue which can be cured if you listen to who is talking to you, both Isaac's ambition to survive the odds given rise to by these messages and your own ambition to run through the blood still keeps you going through the game, despite the offputting level of horror and terror.Excruciatingly terrifying at a certain point where Isaac re-enters the USG Ishimura, only to be met by a swarm of unstoppable necromorphs which swarm him like wasps, the paranoia you feel when you hear a distant necromorph, thinking you've killed them all, and you think they're too far away to reach you in time, but just as you go to run, it's fangs are buried in your leg is undescribable.

												Dead Space 2 is the follow on from the original Dead Space, a survival horror action game.  The game was released in 2011.  The plot is set three years after the events of Dead Space 1, and we are playing again as Isaac Clarke. This time we get to hear his voice though!Like the original, you play in a third-person perspective looking just over the right hand shoulder. Pretty much everything gameplay wise is identical to the original too. The only change I did come across is that all of the weapons and suite upgrades are all unlocked from the start which I thought was a little odd, I just stuck with a trusty pulse rifle rather than gungho with a flamethrower... The hacking system is again done very well here, slightly different to #1 but still just as compelling and simple enough to complete. The graphics are also slightly better here; this game is made using the Visceral Engine (unlike the first), which some may be familiar with if they have played the Battlefield series of games. This game does look phenomenal though; even now at four years old. Story wise follows on from the first game, I would say you need to play the original if you want to understand what is happening as I think it would leave you with lots of unanswered questions if you don't. I'm not sure what else they can do with the story; however I will surely find out when I play the third in the series soon. That being said; I finished the game in two sittings which for me that is quite an achievement and means the story had me immersed straight away. As Dead Space 1 had, Dead Space 2 has amazing audio too; jump scares, screams, music changes, all of it adds up to make this a horror experience you won't forget in a long time. If you don't find jump scares frightening, you probably won't find any other aspect of the game scary though. We have a couple of difficulty settings; I would not recommend Easy mode unless you are purely playing for the story as you will not die when playing. Once you complete the game you also unlock an even harder mode to playthrough. All of the levels are well designed and include lots of corridors swarming with activity in for you to explore for extra pickups and ammo. Some of the areas are the same ones as in the first, but this is very minimal and only used for story reasons.A full playthrough of Dead Space 2 took me about thirteen hours, which is a similar time to the first. I am perfectly happy with the amount of content the game has to offer, it is a linear story mode so I wouldn't expect any more time wise. There is a hint of replay-ability with new game+ modes, but realistically I don't see there being another reason to play it more than once.No massive technical problems while playing; the only issue I had was the game plays at 30 fps. However this can be changed using nVidia or AMD card options,a link to this how to guide here:http://solidlystated.com/software/dead-space-2-30-fps-limit-bypass/ I would also note that the Steam store for this game says it uses a 3rd party DRM called Tages, however I do not think it is used anymore, I have no software installed, nor do I get any prompts for it in game. I think it is safe to ignore that warning now. In conclusion, Dead Space 2 is an absolutely stunning sequel in the Dead Space series; I loved this game just as much as the first. I really recommend people give this game ago if they haven't already. Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended  5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Pros-The story is pretty fun, the new characters are well realised.-The gameplay is vastly improved compared to the first one-The sound design is still top notch.-Isaac speaks now and has more of a personality-Some setpieces can bring up a lot of tension-The first 10 chapters are good...Cons-...The last five turn the game into a straight up shooter.-Only a few new enemies compared to Dead Space.-Relies a lot more on jump scares than the first one-Isaac speaks now and has more of a personality.Neutral-Too many enemies thrown at you toward the end of the game (especially the last 2 chapters)-No character as creepy as Dr. Mercer.The game feel at the same time familiar and different. The enemies are mostly the same, the dismemberment is still here and still feels good, the gameplay has been refined and the production value has increased resulting in a better game but not necessarily a better Dead Space game. If you are looking for more Dead Space, you will be able to find it here but be ready for a lot more action than the first game.			",780,139,51,71,29,7,85

												After playing this game a few times through, I found that it is one of the most realistic and most terrifying horror experiences ever created, I'm here to review it.Overview: Dead Space™ 2 is an extremely realistic horror experience that is, in my opinion, the best in the series. This is because of its outstandingly realistic visuals, sounds and jump-scares that will keep you on the edge of your seat all of the way through your experience. It has an amazing storyline (that you really need to play the first game to understand) and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of horror, and I'm here to tell you why.Presentation: Dead Space™ 2 has some of the most outstanding visuals in any horror game I've ever seen. Horror games aren't even meant to look realistic! They usually just scare you with jump-scares and extremely scary sounds. This game does a lot more than that, and that's why it's my favourite in the series. It has amazing detail, from hovering around space to stomping on necromorph corpses, or even seeing a man getting possessed from behind by some huge-claw wielding monster. Even changing into a different suit looks amazing! If you're one of those people who is usually fussy with bad graphics and you want something more realistic-looking, this is definitely one of the games for you. But these graphics aren't the only amazing thing about this game, there is much, much more that makes this my favourite horror game to date.Gameplay:Now here is where Dead Space™ 2 never fails to impress, the gameplay. From quick-time events that require you to press/mash a certain key to save your skin - to shooting off a necromorph's legs with a Plasma Cutter. This games' gameplay aspect definitely didn't fail to impress me. Well, running around in a straight-jacket away from man-eating monsters is always fun, especially when you jump right into it. This game jumps right into action, this is what I really love! When you really don't expect it, you could be mauled by a huge boss from nowhere, or even just a gunship commanded by people who want you dead. This game also has a great inventory system, (requiring you to be away from necromorphs to actually open it safely) which helps you keep track of your weapons, ammo and highly-profitable conductors. These can all be sold at stores for credits, which can be used to buy other weapons, suits and nodes. (to upgrade your RIG) Your RIG helps you to stay alive, you can upgrade it using power nodes. This is one thing that is more in-depth than it was in the original Dead Space™, (along with a much wider variety of suits/armour) you can upgrade weapons and your RIG with these power nodes that you can either buy or scavenge from around the Dead Space™ world. The best part of this game in my opinion is stomping on necromorphs after they're down to collect their loot, now who wouldn't say that's fun? I'm guessing people who aren't utterly crazy, and if you've already played this game; you must be!Verdict/Summary:Dead Space™ 2 is the most realistic and terrifying experiences to date, (in my opinion of course) I'm sure a lot of the people who have already played and completed this game many times would agree with that statement. This game proves that you don't need an open-world to have an amazing game! If you want jump-scares, action and realistic gameplay with an amazing plot/storyline; this is definitely the game for you.9.5/10: Amazing!Pros:Amazingly realistic visualsLots of actionGreat storyFlawless gameplayCons:Linear StorylineI recommend this to anyone who enjoys horror!

												Ok so let's start of by saying that last time we saw Isaac Clarke he was shall we say not alltogether sane after his experience with his time spent on the planetcracker USG Ishimura and even though we knew it wasent over we didnt know of the horror that was to come.Set three years after the event's in the original Dead Space,this time protagonist Isaac Clarke find's hinself in a fight for his life against a new Necromorph outbreak on the Sprawl,a space station above Saturn's largest moon,Titan.Isaac is at a disadvantage right from the get go as he is believed to have lost his mind and when the outbreak kick's of this time he is in a straitjacket strapped on an upright bed and wondering if this is it?????Of course he need not worry as a certain Franco Delille set's him free (protagonist of Dead Space Ignition) but we all know what happen's to character's that are'nt that important in these games dont we (NO WHAT HAPPEN'S TO THEM????-ARE YOU HAVING ME ON OR WHAT?????)Dead Space 2 - Launch Trailer - YouTube

Right as allways down to the brass tac's of the game and first of the most important aspect for this game the story.Now i for one was wondering how they would carry on the story and for the second part of what has so far been a trilogy they have hit the nail on the head.Is the story in this game told as well as in the first?????,yes and no is the answer and i will explain why on both points.When i say yes it makes me happy to say that,as this was one game i didnt want them to mess up on and i am happy to say they didnt and the story flow's and take's you on a journey that (if your a fan of the original) you wont forget.Now let me explain why i said no,i really enjoyed the first game and the story but i dont remember Isaac being (for use of a better term) ""a potty mouth"".Now im not a prude (far from it) but i find the change in Isaac not one that i appriciated or liked but i must say i didnt find that it put me of at all (but it was there in the back of my mind whilst playing).Now to say more about what goes on than i allready have will not only spoil all the surprise's the game has in store for you but also all the terror and sheer shock's you will get from discovering it on your own (and you would'ent want those spolit now would you????).Now the sound in game (just like in the first game) really does a fantastic job of building tension and really does help to move the game along and without it,it just wouldent be the same game and experience that it is,and it will also creep into your psyche as you play to the point where you dont notice its there and it meld's into the background.""Dead Space 2"", full HQ Original Videogame Score (OST) + ...

The graphic's in this game really do a superb job of putting you in Isaac's shoes (well space-boots) in a situation so dire with creature's that can only be described as coming from your nightmare's being brought to life as they not only look horrific but there are different type's and each one has their own animation and attack style's to make each encounter memorable.The animation during Isaac's death scene's are at one all different enough (when you die at the hand's of different enemies that is) that you wont tire of them but at the same time you wont want to see them as some are (not to put to finer point on it) horrific!!!!!!!The art design for the sprawl has also been thought out well and to be honest it doesnt feel like a space station but more like one huge gigantic haunted house with you as a very unhappy and terrified customer.As you wander around you will find yourself looking at the design of the space station and wondering if at any moment it will also actually come to life and try to claim your soul and your sanity.Now the gameplay does feel familiar but the game does actually seem more combat based than the first and allthough this has upset some for me i found it not to be a problem.It doesnt effect the story in any way and if anything when facing of against larger numbers of Necropmorph's it actually seem's to bump up the tension rather than diminish it.Unlike its predecessor,Dead Space 2 has a multiplayer mode,pitting human character's against Necromorph's across the Sprawl and this offer's more needed replayability for the game as you choose whether to fend of the dreaded creature's or try to infect the hapless humans,and this game mode play's out really well and yet it just hasent been thought out and implemented as well as it could have been (might just be me),but Dead Space in my eyes is meant to be a solo experience and one to be enjoyed scared to death on your own.Now the one thing that i remember most about the first game was the ending and this game does try to play a little trick on you at the end and............................will we make it ""What"" (WELL NOT SAYING).SPOILER ALERT*****IF YOU WANT TO DISCOVER THE ENDING FOR YOURSELF DONT WATCH*****SPOILER ALERTDead Space 2 Final Boss Fight, Ending, And Bonus Ending ...

												Dead Space™ 2 feels and behaves like the first Dead Space™ installment, but adds more monsters and continues with Isaac's story. I must say that I liked this one a little better in some parts, although most of the horror from the first game is gone (some jumpscares here and there but overall the fear element is removed, which is good because nothing can surprise us now after the first time).The Steam version has all the DLC bundled, and has all the goodies unlocked, so you'll just grab one or two suits along the game and that's it, you won't be too tempted with the schematics. You can disable this though, or just ignore the suits, if you want to have a bigger challenge.The story is superb and the gameplay is really good. Graphically speaking is the same as many 2010s games, and has a lot of atmosphere, lens flares and all that stuff EA loves.			",697,171,26,80,62,9,120

												Dead Space 2 takes place in 2511 on Titan Station, also known as The Sprawl, orbiting Saturn's largest moon. It's been three years since the events of the first Dead Space game. CEC Engineer: Isaac Clarke awakens in a hospital, suffering from hallucinations of his troubled past. During his awakening, the civilian space station is subsequently plagued with a deadly alien outbreak, little to be known as the Necromorph infestation. The living, breathing, nightmare encountered previously has made a return for the worst. It's up for Isaac, as well as a small band of survivors to put a stop to this, once again. Along the way Clarke battles his inner demons caused by widespread dementia. The effects caused by a man-made artifact with alien origin, known as the Red Marker. Dead Space 2 has an incredible atmosphere. The length of the campaign is reasonable, most will find themselves spending a fair share of hours collecting data and enjoying all 15 chapters, slowly piecing the story together.This series in particular is primarily a thirdperson shooter. Dead Space 2 features a HUD that quite frankly, stands out from most others. The R.I.G. and Kinesis Module can be found on the back of Clarke's suit, while the ammunition meter is shown on the side of your tool or weapon. 360° camera movements are available, so you can watch your guard throughout every dark corner of The Sprawl. This feature is also great for taking professional looking screenshots. The game includes a limited amount of cutscenes, so you're never dragged too far away from the excitement. The visuals are beautifully done, making the game a real treat to explore. The combat system is pretty basic, although dismembering your enemies can be extremely satisfying. There are no loading screens in-game unless you happen to die, so you are fighting for your survival none stop. The game also includes more character interaction than in the previous title. There's also  just as many environments containing puzzles throughout DS2, as there was in DS1 to put Isaac Clarke's Engineering skills to the test. Jason Graves composed an outstanding soundtrack, the sound design makes the experience so much more effective. If you listen carefully enough while idling you will hear unearthly screeches and survivors whispering; sooner or later this will increase the tension. Zero-G areas in-game have been vastly improved compared to in DS1. There's also a wider variety of unlockables featured here. Upgrading your weapons at the bench, or purchasing items from the store is always fun and interesting. If you happen to lose track of where you are going not to worry, the Locator will help guide you through any situation. Dead Space 2 includes a variety of difficulty modes, both appealing to casual and hardcore gamers alike. These modes include: Casual, Normal, Survivalist, Zealot and Hardcore. Adding more replay value to the game, the developers created an unlockable weapon known as the Hand Cannon. This is available to anyone who completes DS2 on hardcore difficulty.In DS1 Isaac never spoke, which was tolerable to some extent. However he has now been granted a voice. Clarke reacts more often to scares than he did in DS1; this makes a great addition. Gunner Wright does a fantastic job portraying Isaac. Many scenes throughout DS2 are fairly emotional really hitting you at the right moments. The player will care about the protagonist, pitying Clarke more so than in the previous game. The supporting cast of characters also put on a great effort throughout. As we progress further into the story we learn more about them. Unfortunately for Isaac you can never trust everyone, he learns this the hard way. Remember folks there's always Peng!If you're seeking for an adrenaline pumping sci-fi horror experience, I suggest you look no further.			",692,151,13,43,51,6,98

												The title says ""Dead Space 2"", however, the game places as if it was ""Dead Space 1.5"" - and don't get me wrong, that is not a bad thing. The first game was nearly flawless in a sense of re-launched the survivor horror genre. The second game succeeds in reigniting the experience of the first game and adding new useful elements.I remember playing Cold Fear. It's a great game with insanely crappy controls on par with Resident Evil and the constantly changing camera view. While playing Cold Fear, I recall that the only real effective way to stay alive and progress in the game quickly was by walking and aiming at the same time. That way, you would actually prevent the constant camera changing views as well as cumbersome controls. As sad as that may be, I found myself doing a lot of that in Dead Space 2, but then again, in Cold Fear you were not in constant danger of being jumped by a monster from behind the corner. The controls become much more smoother and responsive when you walk and aim at the same time, and I think that is a crappy control design, both for PC players and probably the console players.I feel sorry for left-handed people here since this game only has the right over-the-shoulder view. I mean, how hard is it to give the option of switching the view?It is very welcome to be able to hear Isaac's voice this time. Playing as a mute in video games is a slight immersion killer, at least in my case.Also, in the first game, Isaac would start walking on the diagonal line, wherever you were trying to walk diagonally by pressing W and S or W and A. When you try to do that in the second game, the angle at which Isaac starts walking is barely noticeable, it still feels as if he is walking straight up instead of making a slight left or right - you'll know what I am talking about.Now in order for you to turn anywhere effectively, you'd have to use your mouse, and to be honest, I don't remember too many games doing that, with the exception of Cold Fear, Resident Evil 4 and 5.But back to the positive things:I know this is cliche but the graphics are exceptionally well done and extremely detailed - you will see for yourself. The shadows, the lightening are flawless to say the least.The game is scary, but you knew that already. I think the first game was many times scarier than the last two Resident Evil games. The second game will definitely put some small temporary dents in your psyche. I found myself jumping and cursing repeatedly.The physics work like they would in the actual world, and the telekinesis ability would probably solve most of your problems.The music in this game is a must. When I play this game for the second time, I'll probly play without the music, since it always kills the immersion for me, but on the other hand, a large portion of the scares in the game are contingent upon the ""music"" if you can call it that. The downside is that the constant screeching music can be a give away, since it subsides when you kill enemies in your immediate area, just like in the first game.The sound is one of the pillars of this game, and it's probably where the heart of this game is. You constantly hear the distant growls as well as scratching in the ventilation shafts. The voice acting is passable.There is more open space now and this open space still feels like, well, the open dead space, with or without the monsters.The battles are still as satisfying as ever, but they can get frustrating at times. The good old retreat-them-and-shoot-them formula doesn't always work here, because you WILL find yourself surrounded. The game can get pretty hard on the Zealot mode, but I hate the fact that they give you an option to change difficulty in mid game, what a cop out! Plus I don't like the option challenging my commitment and resolve to beating almost any game I play on the maximum difficultyThere are plenty of weapons, but my favorite still remains the good old plasma rifle. I mean come on, all that engineering and mining equipment is interesting and all but we still want to see some automatic fire.The game plays great in 3D vision and there are no FPS spikes.The environments are more varied. You can actually get plenty of solid glimpses of the pre-necromorph normal civilian lifeThe new monsters are really well implemented, but I couldn't help but feel that some of them were already used in Left4Dead. I guess at some point you will start running out of ideas and start recycling the old ones. Nevertheless, the AI stays strong.As with the first game, the save stations are enough to give you the incentive to be cautious and not rush, die and re-load constantly.The good old weapon and skill upgrades are still here.I should also point out the great pacing of the game. They really did a good job of making you semi-relaxed and then unleashing hell on you and vice versa. I think I should also mention something that is taken for granted. With the exception of save stations, this game is continuous. That is, you will never see a loading screen, and your screen will never go dark for a few seconds; This game is like a continuous narration of a nightmare and you are the protagonist with emotions and aspirations. Consider other games and think of how many loading screens you will go through that interrupt the game play and mar the immersion.Word of advice, count your shots and memorize how many shots it takes to kill a necromorph, there is a good chance you really didn't kill one.The multiplayer is not bad.  If you play as humans, you will have a few minutes to complete an objective, and that gameplay does feel like a co-op experience. If you play as the necromorph, you will have to stall and prevent the humans from completing their objective by spawning in strategic areas and working as a team. It's fun, but I doubt many will play the multiplayer in a few months.Play it for the awesome singleplayer and its highest punishing difficulty.			",373,36,1,24,8,2,38

It's not like any other game, there's is no HUD and your health is read from the lights on th back of the player.

												I'll keep my review brief.I know it's late into the game's release to really write a review, but I feel like writing it may give whoever reads it a little more insight into the game if you're someone who decided to play it as late as I did. It's never too late to start, right?Either way, in Dead Space 2, you play as DS1's protagonist, Isaac Clark, three years down the line from the previous game. Suffering with a rare form of dementia, unknowing to where he is, and continuously haunted by his dead girlfriend and the events of the Ishamura, Isaac is forced to pick up the guns and the classical suit of armor once again and fight for his life, but this time, for answers.You, as Isaac, must take whatever lead you get to piece together your now shattered mind, and most of all, find out exactly what's causing your mind to be so broken in the first place.--For gameplay, it plays very nice, and I have to say I enjoyed how they've made the Stasis actually have a proper use for enemies rather than just puzzles. I played the whole of the first Dead Space with hardly having to use Stasis other than when it was compulsory for progression - In the intro mission in the game showed off what you could now do with the Telekenisis, too, which was something in the first game that had very little use as well.Enemies are more brutal, but at the same time, more annoying - I loved the feel of Dead Space 1, even more so the way it made your heart pump whenever you had more than a couple of necromorphs coming at you - In this game, however, the enemies sometimes became a bit of a bore, or a chore to deal with. That was something I never personally experienced with the first game.I felt that a lot of the timing for some of the enemies was wrong, and at points, it felt like they were just thrown in there for the sake of giving the player something to do. With large clusters of enemies, your stasis becomes increasingly critical, but even then, if you're someone like me who doesn't sink power nodes into upgrading the stasis ability, you can find yourself in a tough spot, where all the enemies are taking cheap-shots one after the other, making it impossible to have full health for more than 30 seconds in the game.THe collectibles in this game were sometimes hidden in ridiculous locations, but then again, they're collectibles for a reason. I don't think it's entirely fair that they decided to have it so that power nodes were floating in space, tucked away behind junk in zero-gravity, across a gap that required TK to reach, etc, etc. But I guess that they can't make things too easy.Anyone who's played this will hopefully agree with me on this one: The store system is god-awful. At the start of the game I was baffled to find that the worst suit I could choose from (based on armor and inventory space), cost 1000 credits, whereas every other suits (non-vanilla versions, 15 inventory slots, 15% armor, certain buffs) cost absolutely nothing to get. Same for the weapons that weren't vanilla - Given, I didn't upgrade any of the weapons until I had the default schematic, but honestly, I feel that with the store system they tried far too hard to make something better, but in the end made something much worse.Navigation of the store system felt clustered and frustrating, and trying to find all the default models of weapons among the non-defualt, modified ones, was just an effort that you shouldn't have to make. In my opinion they had the store system perfect in the original game, so this factor left me disappointed.Also, speaking of the suit - What the hell, guys? Why get rid of the classic? I know it takes place a few years down the line, but come on, at least return the 'find the suit level schematics and get something that looks way more kickass than what you've got now' system - I LOVED that. Don't get me wrong, the Elite Suit looked very nice, but the others were quite mediocre if you ask me.The weapons - I liked the new choice, and choosing the Seeker Rifle over some of the old classics wasn't hard to do. The Plasma Cutter is also very powerful at the start in comparison to the first game, which was definitely a nice surprise.The story was pretty good, too - I felt there was a high sense of mystery within it, which was great. Not knowing anything and gradually piecing things together via text and voice logs was something that the first game did well at; although it didn't feel as frightening in this one, it was still good. I also noticed there was a lack of audio files in comparison to the first game? On the contrary of that, though, some of them legitimately had me shaken when I listened to them, so the fewer amount was made up for by that factor right there.I think to understand the story, you HAVE to play the first one, otherwise Isaac's situation, and the continuous appearances of a certain character, do not make much sense. TO summarize my opinion of the game, it was good overall, but if you're looking for something similar to the classic Dead Space, I'm willing to bet that 9/10 of you won't get that. DS2 was a game that definitely won a spot in my favorite survival horrors, but is nowhere near to how legendary the original was. I loved Dead Space 1, and some of the features I found in this game left me feeling slightly disappointed.Some parts were spot-on, others felt like they were slightly rushed, and some parts felt like the developers tried far too hard to make improvements where improvements weren't necessarily needed. Like they say - If it ain't broke, don't fix it.			",131,17,2,8,22,1,4

												9/10Overview: Survival Horror-Third Person Shooter The Good:+Graphics, lighting and atmosphere are fantastic and provide a real sense of horror + No HUD makes things more immersive + I love that once you gain control of the main character, you never lose control, there are no cut scenes, cgi or anything that takes you away from the character. All the action takes place from the characters perspective and that provides an extra layer of immersion. +The game provides a great sense of pacing, slowly introducing new enemies, gameplay mechanics, locations and puzzles to keep you second guessing what's around the next corner. In addition the sequel adds lots of cinematic set piece moments that really amplify the tension and action. + Variety of weapons each with their own primary and secondary functions opening up new play styles + Finding nodes throughout the ship as well as purchasing it in the store allows you to upgrade your weapons and suit+ Combat has been improved, not only is shooting limbs off enemies satisfying but you can use your telekinesis to rip claws off enemies and shoot it back at them + Monsters look, feel and act scary along with good diversity to keep combat engaging. + Improved zero gravity section + Variety of death animations+ new game + mode + Sound effects and music really add to the tensionThe Average:The game is more focused on action than horror especially as the game progresses. The story can be hit or miss depending on how invested you are in the universe and characters.The Bad- vsync locks frame rate at 30fps-multiplayer is deadConclusionI have played this game many, many times on the Xbox360 and this is still one of my favorite survival horror games. It does so many things right in the genre. I STRONGLY recommend this game to anybody who either loves survival horror games or third person shooters. I do consider this game to be the best in the trilogy as Dead Space 3 has some really questionable design decision.   ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												Some games give its sequel demanding expectations to meet and Dead Space is certainly one of them. In Dead Space 2, the gameplay feels much smoother and the controls are more responsive than in its prequel. Isaac Clarke has an entire wardrobe of engineering suits now, each having unique bonuses and advantages in combat. Old weapons are modified and the new weapons bring more excitement into combat. Some of the new enemies will swarm you in a pack, some will charge at you, and some are just overwhelmingly massive, but all present a fun challenge. What really amazes me is that Dead Space 2 still managed to maintain an incredible story. You’ll truly despise some of the characters, but also pray that others survive the necromorph massacre. The graphics are gorgeous and sometimes breathtaking when venturing in space around Saturn. If you enjoyed Dead Space 1, then this is a no-brainer.The Good+Campaign starts strong and ends strong+Dismembering necromorphs is as thrilling as ever+Some great new necromorph types+Wonderfully atmospheric visuals and sound designThe BadHmm let me think, none			",202,36,5,20,8,1,15

												Dead Space 2 is back with more gore and over the shoulder person survival horror in space! This time the almost faceless silent protagonist named Issac Clark is back from deep space, but in this sequel he now has a face and a voice! Is it for the better because he now talks to people? Its not better or worse he's more of a vanilla flavor now instead of being just a mystery like the first game. One quick downside is that you'll need an Origin account. Yep, feel free to hate the game because you need to log in even if you don't actually need Origin on your PC, just an account. Now that's out of the way the people who aren't outraged into throwing bloody feces can read on.For those that didn't play the first game, you have an optional video recap of the first game and its events that happened. When the game opens, the space station you're on board has already been taken over by alien necromorphs that use dead bodies to mutate them into a variety of creatures.  The game has always boasted strategic dismemberment, so you'll need to shoot an enemy in the legs where it will then crawl after you. Shoot its head and it will blindly swing at you. Its a nice dynamic that really boils down to your aim.Since the space station is being overrun with creatures, you'll see NPCs fighting for their lives in scripted sequences, but it doesn't break the flow of the game with straight up cut scenes. It feels like you'll always have movement or the game will always be moving forward. It adds to the immersion process. Even if you are not alone, you're the only person that can do anything. The game is beautiful with all of its horrific glory, lighting effects and sheer beauty of space. You get a scale and a scope with this game. You'll look over space apartments, see shuttles leaving and others crashing. You'll walk through a church, and a brightly lit, yet super creepy kindergarten school. It feels like the station is alive where the original Dead Space 1 felt very controlled circumstances, like nothing was happening without you being there in the room.Is it scary? The game has gone through great lengths to make this game legitimately scary and more tense than the first game. Its not just scary monsters chasing you oh how scary. Its being haunted by your dead girlfriend. The game also manages to put you in a lot of helpless moments such as being in a straight jacket with enemies around or hanging upside down and forced to murder enemies before they reach you (some might call it a turret section with a twist). There are some memorable scenes. Other than that, the game keeps a dark atmosphere with amazing lighting. You still get a flashlight that only works when you aim. Thankfully the developers have really done a lot to clean up the ragdoll problem that had the dead enemies get stuck in the player's feet for laughs. The controls have improved from the first game, thankfully there are now hot buttons for health, reload and other minor tweaks that feel so much better. For those that haven't played, left stick controls movement, right stick or mouse controls the camera, you have 4 weapon slots to change in the D-pad, an aim button, shoot button, which is also the melee button when not aiming, telekinesis button to pull objects, stasis button to slow objects down while you run by, run button, health button and so on. There's even a stomp button for destroying boxes and when you think enemies are dead, but they haven't dropped any items, so you go over and stomp them for valuable prizes like health and ammo. Thankfully the game's map and inventory have been replaced, with easy to use 'follow the line on the floor' when you push a button and the inventory only appears when you're at a store. The line on the floor disappears, so its not a blunt cheat so much as a brief hint if you need it.Dead Space 2 takes you through extra steps that Dead Space 1 didn't really touch on to teach and inform you extra ways to use your powers. Such as using telekinesis to pick up and throw items at enemies that seems to damage them more than your guns can.The station has stores that allow you to sell your items, buy more weapons, ammo, health and suits to wear. Each suit now has a special buff, which feels good and it give you more choice and our hero Issac will have more style! Buffs like weapon X does more damage, more health when you use health packs, more air and so on. You can still find health and ammo in a lot of places. Dead Space 1 and 2 both reward you for looking around, but for the most part if it has a light, there's something in it. You'll also get energy nodes that you go to upgrade benches and upgrade your weapons, suits, stasis powers and so on with simple to follow upgrade paths. One node per point on the upgrade path and it might take you 3 points to upgrade what you want. Its a nice system. At some point you'll earn the right to resort your nodes so if you've put everything into stasis and air, you won't be screwed in later parts of the game.The original game was good, but this adds a lot more to the gameplay, such as now in zero gravity areas, you don't just leap from point A to point B in a straight line, now you can jet around.  You can also climb through air ducts in realistic third person fashion and there are also hacking mini games that boil down to, circle the left thumbstick until you find what you're looking for. These might not be ground breaking, but they feel like a good diversion from the norm.Dead Space 2 offers a lot of new enemies and situations. New enemies that vomit at you, new raptor like humanoids that will flank you and call to each other before charging straight at you, new children, new exploding babies and much more. You'll find new bosses that offer more variety than the original game's bosses. All of the enemies are back from Dead Space 1, but this time the developers have gone through, reskinned old enemies and offered more variety in every creature. It won't just be the same mutated man in a labcoat, it will be a variety of people and genders. It feels good and fresh in what could have easily been just a same old rehash. Speaking of a rehash, while you're in space, you're no longer on a space ship, now you're on a space station that has a lot of different areas, slums, apartments, med labs, and so on. Its all about diversity here.The game has improved little details such as the arm extension into walls. It just feels fresh while feeling very familiar. There is also tacked on multi-player that requires you to have an Origin account that features 4 players as engineers vs 4 players as enemies. So that's good I guess, but the single player experience is the real star here.For anyone that truly wants the game it has been on sale for $5 pretty frequently. Give it some time. Otherwise, I'd say the game is worth $20 and I'm cheap.			",1125,324,51,104,96,15,167

												Dead Space 2 is pretty cool, I guess.Set a few months after the events of Dad Space, a reverse horror game where an irate Space Engineer violently hunts and exterminates Space Zombies aboard a Space Ship orbiting a Space Planet with about as much efficiency and brutality as you would expect from someone who never has a chance to use his degree outside of murder. You once again play as Isaac Clarke, the galaxy's most notorious mass murderer born from two dads. Isaac is less than sane after the events of the first game and is put into a holding cell aboard a space station city while constrained with a  straitjacket in hopes of containing his endless blood lust.It didn't. About two minutes into the game, Isaac is awoken by a crazy man who wishes to release the eternal man slayer from his confines. Unfortunately, Issac's devout follower is attacked by an infector (That's what the wiki calls them, don't hold me to it.) and turns him into a horrible space monster. A space monster that Isaac promptly headbutts in the face and knocks flat on it's♥♥♥♥♥ Honestly, they could have just kept Isaac from being able to use his arms through the entire game just to make it fair. Now, I played Dad Space and Dads Space back to back over the course of a few days now. And I immediately noticed a difference between the two. For one, I personally preferred using a controller during Dad Space because the aiming felt sluggish with a mouse. This is gone in Dads Space, now that Isaac apparently remembered he's the only competent person in the galaxy and quick shoots like a master. It's almost like he's been shooting at these things for two games now or something. The second game was developed by Visceral games as opposed to Redwood. They must have taken criticisms from the first game to heart because, not only can Isaac still punch a zombies head clean off it's body, but he's also stronger, faster, and a better shot than he was in the first game. If the Earth government was smart they would stop trying to clone the marker  and instead Clone Isaac Clarke, effectively making an unstoppable super soldier army that also knows how a ship engine works. But honestly, at this point, I'm 100% sure that either someone at EA or their developer teams have no idea how a horror game should work. The Ishimura wasn't really all that spooky, sure, but it was fun to explore. There was this almost classic Resident Evil vibe to going from room to room and robbing dead people while going through their personal diaries. But Titan Station is just too linear for it's own good. It feels like you're being led down a long hallway with a few branches now and then rather than exploring a space station. It keeps the plot moving forward, sure, but they could have padded it out better with more audio logs to discover and maybe even some survivors every now and then. In the original Dad Space, Isaac would sometimes run into a survivor on the Ishimura, sure they usually died or were way past the point of return, but it made the Ishimura feel like a place people actually lived and worked on for months at a time. After a few chapters in the beginning of the game, Titan Station just kind of empties out, something I can't believe considering big the space city is supposed to be. Unless there was free chipotle being handed out earlier and everyone just had to go to the bathroom all at once, I don't get how so many people would have been evacuated or killed so quickly. Oh, and Isaac talks now. I mean, he had a single line in the first game, but now he can speak full sentences that aren't just grunting and yelling loudly. Also, he no longer runs like a girl, good on you, Isaac. But should you play Dads Space? That depends, how much do you like shooting stuff? Dad Space isn't really a frightening series, I mean, it isn't to me. Dads Space itself is a solid game with some questionable design choices. I mean, near the end of the game there's an on rail shooting segment. Come on, guys. Some disturbing imagery stands out, like the crying baby behind an apartment door which implies the parents either abandoned it or were killed before hand. Or the guy in the beginning of the game that wiped his own dooky on the floor. No, I'm serious, I even took a screenshot, here it is. http://i.imgur.com/2ZrRKga.jpgThat's crazy, is that how you want to be remembered? The guy who died wiping his poo poo on the walls? Who's idea was that? Was it you, Steve Papoutsis: lead producer of Dead space 2? Are you the doo doo guy? If you like the series, then why are you even reading this? But if you want to get into the series and liked the first one? You'll probably like Dads Space's gameplay more than Dad Spaces but probably not the setting and atmosphere. Dad's Space gets 5 Engineers cussing while stomping boxes out of 6. And now I move on to Dad3 Space while we wait for Dad Resurrection Space. The curator, I assure you I spend a lot less time talking about poop walls here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation ",283,25,4,43,14,2,59

Requires you to join their mailing list to get all the content, wont actually let you join, and then for some mad reason gives you all the weapons and armor for free on your first playthrough, completely negating the need to find them as you go.Serious, first shop you find you get the best armour and all the posible weapons for free, what's the ♥♥♥♥ing point of finding cash or schematics when you get all the endgame stuff in the first chapter?

												Compared to Dead Space 1, this game has less atmosphere and more action. Isaac now has a face and voice, taking away from the immersion slightly. The game is still very fun and interesting, however. It trades in the creepy, lonely moments of Dead Space 1 where small sounds make you twitch and replaces it with frantic ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥"" moments where enemies are all over you and you don't know how you are going to deal with them all and survive with what little ammo you have left. While not as atmospheric as the first, this game is still very fun and intriguing, and you will want to know even more about this universe that visceral has created. 7.5/10			",664,314,11,86,52,8,131

Building upon the strong foundation of the previous game, Dead Space 2 provides a great and thrilling experience you will not soon forget.Overall: Dead Space 2 is a must play if you enjoy the first game. The magnificent sound effects and the intense gameplay will prove highly enjoyable throughout all 15 chaptersAgain if you like the first dead space, you Should Not miss this. If you feel lazy of playing the first one, the game has a nice feature, a cinematic of the first game, explaining the story and events, and you can start right away.			",1949,754,75,171,243,17,313

												Step 1: Crawl into the dark machine.Step 2: The screws go tight all around. Step 3: Cross your heart and hope to die. Stick a needle in your eye. Dead Space 2 is one of the most incredible gaming experiences of my lifetime. It builds on everything the original Dead Space accomplished. But what really causes this game to shine over many others is its narrative. It's deep, thought inducing, and genuinely compelling. Issac is a fully realized character. You're doing yourself a disservice not diving into this game.			",97,11,0,15,4,0,21

												Now That what you call a Masterpiece.Dead Space 2 is one of the greatest Horror Game ever made. Even in its Prequel Everything was Predictable but in Dead Space 2 Everything was changed. Jumpscares were almost unknown and everything from the previous game was made better. Psychic Horror was the best thing in this game. I mean you can't Judge if you can't play. So, its 100 percent recommended to play. The Graphics were amazing and not a single technical issue with the game. 6 Years and still the best game.			",149,6,2,2,2,0,0

												Better controls and better graphics than in the original. A step up in regards of action, but a step down in regards of horror. But I understand, if you played the original, you'll probably know what you're getting into with this one and you won't be scared. Isn't that the fate of any monster horror game? The first game gives you the dread of the unknown, but the second game cannot do that so it relies on action. No wonder that Dead Space 3 went all out on the action and left behind the horror. But bottom line is that Dead Space 2 (as well as the original) is a must-have game for your Steam games library!

												I loved the first Dead Space. I might like this one too... if I actually got to play the game as it was meant to be played. For some insane reason, in this steam version, EA puts all the pay-to-win items for free in the store! So have fun getting to the first store in Chapter 1 and having every weapon and armor suit for free. Now you might be saying ""just ignore them"". Well, i can with the guns, but i have no idea which suit im supposed to have... Plus, it just totally destorys imersion (critical to this game) and fun of collecting/upgrading throughout the game. Not only that, but apparently it also causes the drops to be different and makes the game overall easier.Once I realized what EA had done, I started looking for ways to disable this pay-to-win crap, and in looking i lost desire to continue playing. What a drag. Maybe Ill come back to it. But I certainly cant recommend such nonsense. A simple toggle of you ""do you want the pay-to-win... errr... dlc bonus items in your game?"" would have fixed this. Why the hell do PC users always get a messed up product when its a multi-plat?

												I played Dead Space 2 quite a bit back then (Origin copy), and I felt obligated to repurchase this great game again.  Dead Space 2 is an atmospheric and immersive action-horror shooter set on the Sprawl.  It takes all the aspects that were great in Dead Space and improved upon them without changing the game mechanics that worked well.If you want a nice challenge to make it feel less action filled, play it on zealot difficulty until you can unlock ""hardcore"" mode.  However, if you are looking for a laid back playthrough, survivalist should feel right at home.In this revival of the classic and critically acclaimed Dead Space, Isaac Clarke battles horrors and psychological barriers.  A nice improvement over the mundane, fetch-it systems engineer that we once knew. Isaac has more of a voice and you get a look into his mind as he traverses through the nightmarish space station.  The Dead Space universe has a warm place in my heart.  Visceral Games, without Electronic Arts' restrictions, are great developers who are extremely passionate about their intellectual property.  It is nice to know that the Dead Space series may be revisited in the future, and talks about Dead Space 4 is not quite dead.Rating:  9.0 out of 10Highly recommended.			",96,21,1,10,1,0,4

												All around fun game. it does trade off some graphic quality(not noticeable) and aditonal animations  for some weapons for faster and fluid controls which is pretty nice. Does however include active animations for the characters, along with a bit more expansion to the necromorphs. Compared to the first one, the first one is alot better as it does emphasize that panicking can make things harder when surviving. This Game is more shooter then survival as you can easily aquire strong equipment due to the dlcs being on it early, but even then soon as you get the pulse rifle or other equipment your just good with it can turn relative easy(especially with the new alt fire for pulse rilfe...upgrade that bad boy easy to clear some situations).(SPOILER SENTENCE) The game does get back at you though at then end of the chapter depending on how much time you deal with the ubermorphs and necros, lets say its a run through to the marker that you don't want to be low on if playing on harder game modes. Its straight forward, storyline is pretty good and the start is one that sets you on your guard for the rest of the game.This game still introducing something alot more fun and even throws in a badd♥♥♥♥♥moments which makes you feel like hots stuff, and small form of comedy if you get through the wall.

												Even though this game is getting a bit ""old"" I would still like to review this game.The story is around 15 hours long and follows isaac clark, he woke up in a space ship after 3 years of being a ""patient"".You will quickly realize that there is something wrong on the ship, its filled with necromorphs (aliens) like in the first game.You are being guided by someone called daina, on your way through you will come across more people for example Stross also known ""Patient 5"" who keeps contacting you troughout the game, about the ""marker"" which attractes/creates necromorph's.You will also meet someone called ""Ellie"" she will be helping you troughout the game and you will be helping her as well.The gameplay is solid, the controlls are good and everything works more then well no cringy controls altough I felt like isaac's movement was a bit slow at times, especialy on parts where you where forced to sprint.The aiming system works really solid as well, there where no annoying issue's which the first game had (where the aiming would be really slow even when you are playing on the highest sensitivity, thankfully this game has no mouse issue's at least not for me.The game also manages to suprise me everytime, and I sat on the tip of my chair to my whole playtrough waiting for a jumpscare to come.The environment is really well designed as well, its dark and scary most of the times and the power will often cut out and fill the area with necromorphs lurking from the darkness.The puzzels in this game are quite intresting as well, they are not really hard to do but they managed to make me think of how to solve them for a little bit.The game also allows you to use a store, where you can buy weapons, ammo, medkits, and even suits, the credit system works well and doesnt give you too much, but enough to make you reconsider what you buy at times.You can also find or buy ""power nodes"" which allow you to upgrade your, suit, weapons or unlock storage rooms which are mostly filled with loot, you have to spend your power nodes really carefull as well, even though i felt like the damage upgrade barely did anything.The enemy design is really great and creepy as well, i often found myself aiming for the legs to kill to slow them down, or cut of one arm and shoot it back at them, shooting at the head wont often result in a kill since they will continue to walk towards you.The audio is really well designed as well, the voice acting was more then great and i often felt like the characters where really in pain, especialy isaac's voice, Thanks alot Gunner Wright for this awesome voice performance.Well comming to a verdict now I would say the game never dissapointed me, has a great story and audio designthe story was really great as well and the ending was really amazing as well.This game deserves a solid 9/10.Thanks alot for reading everyone!

												It's like Dead Space 1 but controls are slightly different, things seem to be a tad more scarier and the story is better. Plus the creatures are actually giving me a hard time! Fun game, more to explore and items aren't in plain sight so you gotta go hunting for them, keeping a slow pace which I really like. P.S I know there was 2009 bug with the save stations but everyone, including me, were just being really dumb. You got to put your weapon down in order to get the save station working. Took me about an hour or two into the game to realize this.			",47,4,2,7,1,0,1

												Not as scary as the first Dead Space, altho i must admit, that ghost girfriend does give a chill in the spine whenever she shows up. Elevator part with her might be the chilliest. But beside that, nothing else in the game was a real fear factor. You become pretty overpowered with your weapon early game. Till the point later on in the game, you just kill everything in your path with ease!9/10ENjoy ^-^			",251,102,1,77,43,1,40

												This review may contain spoilers: However, I will attempt to limit them to the best of my ability.In the 3 years Following the events of Dead Space, and Issac's encounter with the Necromorph on the USG Ishimura, Isaac finds himself in the medican facility of a civilian space station surrounding Titan. Repeatedly questioned, Isaac awakens in a straight-jacket as an apparent Necromorph outbreak begins to take over The Sprawl. Jumping right back into the action seat, Dead Space 2 picks up literally with the heart pounding, fast paced action of the original, leaving us to wonder, will Isaac be able to cheat death a second time? Dead Space 2 looks as good if not slightly better than the original. From the beginning sequences we see some of the familiar Necromorph from the first Dead Space; However, if I know games, I'll put money on new and even more terrifying Necromorph in store for Isaac later on. If you haven't played the first Dead Space, that's alright. Dead Space 2 has a feature to allow new players to the franchise access to a video recap, complete with narration, of the events of the original Dead Space on the USG Ishimura. For the full experience, I recommend playing in the dark, in a quiet part of the house, at night with the sound up. If you love action-packed, sci-fi, horror thrillers, this is right up your alley.

												In my mind this is my favorite game in the series. Dead Space 2 for the pc feels a lot more polished than Dead Space it fixed a lot of issues with pc version being the gameplay. Dead Space 2 is a lot more scarer and a lot more enjoyable it reminds me of Half Life 2 where you could throw the sawblades at the zombies from the Ravenholm, but it takes a lot of great elements away and uses it to make you feel a little bit more exposed when you don't have ammo for any weapon. Instead you have a spear to take on a hoard of alien creatures. Between the gameplay and the none stop action through out it's a really fun and scary something EA actually got something correct. Would highly recommend it especially if you played the first game since Dead Space 2 goes back the first game in a truly fun experience 8/10			",131,22,4,0,6,2,4

Dead Space 2 is one of the best games to come out in 2011DS2 is a third-person horror shooter. I first played through the game back in 2011 just after it released.The game scared the crap out of me! Seriously. It was the most horrifying game i had ever played.However the character development, dark atmosphere and gameplay left a very positive feeling to me so i wanted to revisit the game.Fast forward to January 2016. 4 years after i first played through the game. Graphics still feel nice. Nothing special. It's not on par with the Witcher 2, Battlefield 3, Deus Ex: HR or Crysis 2 (Every single one of these games released in 2011) but it's still a good looking game.It looks damn good for a dark horror game. The lightning and adventuring in the darkness is done perfectly. The armosphere is still there. The sound effects still sound so very good and the gameplay...Ahhh the gameplay is simply a masterpiece!However it doesn't feel like a horror game anymore. At no point was i scared in my second playthrough in 2016. Felt like an ordinary third-person shooter without a cover mechanism.It gave me a few adrenaline rushes when the enemies were coming from different directions and were overwhelming but it didn't actually scare me.Maybe because i had already played through the game or maybe because im now 4 years older. Tho i'm sure that A LOT of people would still find this scary. After all some people think that F.E.A.R games are scary and i strongly disagree with them.The game is great tho. The voice acting is very well done. The few characters in this game actually have CHARACTER and the game constantly keeps you in your seat wondering what's going to happen next.The gameplay is wonderful. You can wield 4 guns at the same time. You can have a pistol, a plasma rifle (an assault rifle) a flamethrower and a line gun (basically a space shotgun) all at once. You can shoot the legs off your enemies to slow them down. They lose their legs but keep crawling towards you and are still quite deadly. The point is that you can dismember your enemies!There are 10 different guns in Dead Space 2 and each gun has a primary and secondary fire option so when it comes to killing aliens there's a lot of variety.You can also pick up pretty much everything from the ground and use that as a weapon. You can kill an alien, pick up its blown off arm and shoot it at another alien.You can also freeze rushing aliens to give yourself more time running away, reloading or dealing with other threats.You can also upgrade your weapons and suits (yeap, you can buy different armors aka space suits) to give you more damage, faster reload speed, more capacity or more health when it comes to armor.Dead Space 2, while being a very scary game, is very fast paced to keep you on your toes at all times and that makes this singleplayer experience one of the best in 2011.Back in 2011 i beat the game using a keyboard and a mouse. Now in 2016 i beat the game using a 360 controller and i gotta say the gameplay is perfectly enjoyable with both of them so feel free to play the game however you want to.There's also a new game+ mode and a hardcore mode which only allowes 3 saves and whenever you die it ports you back to the last save (That's right! No checkpoints!) but you won't get to try that before beating the game first.Dead Space 2 is a masterpiece and totally worth its current full prize!GAME ON! ",707,129,45,70,35,10,64

												As a console peasant I really enjoyed this game. Just replaying it brings back memories. If you're looking for a true horror game this is it. Why? Simply because you aren't left with nothing to defend yourself where you're forced to run. You have to fight your fears and fight your way through hordes of necromorphs. There's no running alternative in this game. No fight or flight option, and that's when we truly panick. Your hands are shaking with each new necromorph that you approach, trying to conserve ammo, trying to keep your will to fight because you know when you have no ammo it's over. This game pits you against monsters you wish you could run from and spam with bullets, but you have to play smart... or you're dead. The true suspense is when it's all died down, but you don't know what vent the next necromorph can come from so you wait for the inevitable.			",66,5,0,4,7,1,3

												The sequal to the original Dead Space game is good if not better in almost every aspect. Dead Space 2 continues the story of Dead Space 1 except Isac Clark not stranded on a ship anymore he's stranded on a space station instead. Even better he suffers from a form of dementia plaguing his mind and threatens to kill him in the form of his old wife Nicole (Lovely isn't it). New characters are introduced in Dead Space 2 Nolan Stose who suffers from the same syptoms and dementia Isacc does, Tidman who is a complete dumbass, and Ellie who could be a better waifu for Isacc than Nicole. The horror and gameplay in Dead Space 2 has improved and is much better compared to the original with more horror( especially scences where Isac's mind interfers and displays Nicole), more action, and more Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥moments. There are more suits and more weapons in Dead Space 2 giving players more stuff to experiment and play with. The suits now have special attributes tied to them like 10% more health recieved from health kits and 15% percent more damage with certain weapons. There are even more different kinds of necromorphs to kill and loot from them is obtained by stomping and smashing them (because who dosen't like that). The religous group in Dead Space 1 makes a return here with thier own church on the space station and so does the government with their government sector. Dead Space 2 is a better version of the orignal and is a must own for people who have played Dead Space 1. I do not recommend buying this on its own, instead buy the Dead Space 1 & 2 bundle and experience the best of both worlds.			",124,4,1,15,3,0,4

												Dead Space 2 takes place three years after the events of the first game.Isaac awakes on a space station known as the Sprawl and finds the place is overwhelmed by an outbreak of reanimated corpses called Necromorphs.The core combat of Dead Space is pretty much unchanged. Isaac Clarke needs to destroy the Marker (the seed of evil), therefore he has to explore a massive space station, work with various characters and kill a lot of Necromorphs. While the plot is similar, the storytelling technique has changed for the better, Isaac can now speak and the voice performances of him are excellent. Adding to the overall tension of Dead Space 2 is one of its central plot lines: Isaac seems to be insane this time around. This plays an important role in the story as delusions begin tormenting him early on including a terrifying ghost version of his dead lover Nicole.Zero gravity mechanics have been overhauled and Isaac is now afforded a full six degrees of motion and able to fly in any direction with his thrusters. One other addition is the ability to hack certain circuit panels, an activity that initiates a quick mini-game.The mutliplayer mode features a familiar experience system, slowly unlocking new goodies as players level up. Necromorphs acquire upgrades to their abilities, while humans can unlock new weapons and armor configurations.Dead Space 2 does not stray far from its roots, but it still manages to provide one of the best action horror experiences available. In short, horror fans should definitely get it.Sounds 9/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1592,618,71,238,229,30,272

												Intro:The Dead Space games are survival horrors!! The series takes place in outer space in the 26th century. Mankind has expanded into space and colonized other planets, but Earth herself is in ecological crisis, having been drained of resources. EarthGov currently resorts to ""planet-cracking"" - the processing of mining entire planets for the recovery of raw materials, with a fleet of specially constructed space-faring vessels. However, EarthGov is investigating a second possibility. During the 23rd century, the Chicxulub crater was found to contain a ""Marker"" - an artifact of extraterrestrial origin which acts as a relay for a persistent electromagnetic field signal, with no apparent source.Dead Space 2 (released in January 2011) is the follow up to the Dead Space game released in 2008. It follows the further adventures of Isaac Clarke in his encounters with the mysterious Marker. The game is set three (3) years after the events of the first Dead Space, the game follows protagonist Isaac Clarke's fight against a new Necromorph outbreak on the Sprawl, a space station surrounding a shard of Saturn's largest moon, Titan. In an asylum on the Sprawl, Isaac Clarke awakens with no memory of the past 3 years since Aegis VII, having just been awoken by Franco Delille (protagonist of Dead Space Ignition), an engineer on the Sprawl who was sent by Daina to rescue Isaac. With the already-ongoing Necromorph outbreak, an Infector kills and mutates Franco into a Slasher in front of Isaac, leaving Isaac to escape on his own... Play the game to see what happens next!!!A central theme in the games is the fictional antagonistic cult religion ""Unitology"". To me, there are many similarities between the fictional Unitology and the real-world Scientology, which I found interesting. (I am not a Scientologist, BTW).To improve playability (this older game) in Windows 10, I used the following resources:1) PCGamingWiki - Deadspace[pcgamingwiki.com] 2) Dead Space 2 30 FPS Limit Bypass (http://solidlystated.com/software/dead-space-2-30-fps-limit-bypass/) 3) Steam Guild, ENB and SweetFX for Dead Space 2 (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=848163349)4) ReShade 3.0, (https://reshade.me/)Game ThoughtsThis was the second game I played in this series. The story was a continuation (from DS1) and I personally enjoy long campaign games. Like its predecessor, this game lives in the Horror/Survival Horror Genre, which I also enjoyed! Win/Win. Regarding game play, the flow of the game was much smoother then in DS1 allowing for better transitions and foot stomps. I also used an XBOX Afterglow (AG) controller when playing this game (dropped the PS4DS). The AG was more comfortable, and found it worked great and without any issues. I will buy Dead Space 3 when it is on sale. I only wish it was on Steam! I had a blast with this game. My rating system for Horror based games is: The Sphincter Factor. 1 thru 51 - Totally Open, you need surgery to fix this Muscle (game) ->5 - Totally Closed (Superb)! Tight as a well diggers a$$ (The Tops, a great game)The Sphincter Factor for Dead Space = Solid 4.75- Great replayability,- Graphics are awesome (I played on ULTRA)- Great atmosphere, IMO,- Awesome soundtrack,- Decent story, - You can upgrade weapons and character armor, and- Boss fights were challenging (for me) and awesome!

												""Isaac, my boyfriend, I wish I could talk to you!""Dead Space 2 is one of my number ones in case of jump scares. It is definitely a very atmospheric game! The developers really knew how to calm you down just to let you scream like a little girl few seconds later! I screamed even when I had to replay some parts and should have expected what was coming.. Never ready enough!Here is a short video of how great the jump scares are:  Dead Space 2 with PlasmaWasp video	I love music and sounds in Dead Space 2! Those little exploders do so funny sounds when incoming. When they explode into your face it's not that funny ;)Fighting aliens is not very hard, except those alien kids who are jumping on you from all possible sides and make you never want to have kids for that reason ;) Dead Space 2 is also about solving puzzles! Not sure if it's just me, but some of them were more challenging for me than most of the fighting..I don't like quick time events and Dead Space 2 has some. it's mostly about pressing E, so not too difficult, but still.. I don't think it was neccessary to add it into the game. It destroyed some moments for me when I even didn't notice there was some request almost out of the screen to press E.If you are attracted to futuristic scary games in space, killing aliens and solving puzzles, this game will definitely not disappoint you! I recommend starting with Dead Space, because the stories are connected and you will understand better what's going on!So now buy the game, wait until midnight, turn off all of your lights, turn on sound volume pretty high and enjoy!

												Dead Space 2 is the second game in the triology of Dead SpaceThis game shows what happend to Issac Clark after the events of Dead Space 1I won't spoil any story or plot elements, but I will say this. The story is extreamly intresting and it sucks you in.The gameplay is mostly the same as in Dead Space 1. Only now you get Difrent suits of armor with difrent buffs.The Graphics: The graphics look ♥♥♥♥ing AWSOME! The amount of detail I saw in each section. The chareters looked good, hell even a bit life like. The necromorphs looked like they were real tormented, disfigured people. The scare factor is lower that in DS1, but it's quite perfect in most parts.The gore/blood looks a bit too much like water. In the end I rate this game 8/10 (Not as scary as the first one but has better action elements that add to the fun/scare) ",143,16,3,23,16,0,8

												If you're looking for an awsome single player game, Dead Space 2 is for you.  Dead Space 2 is thrid-person horror/shooter game where you play as the main protagonist Isaac Clarke.  Located on the Sprawl, a giant space station, you have to fight your way through a violent Necromorph outbreak.  The Necromorphs are a parasite that reanimates corpses, turning them into monster-like creatures who spread the infection to more. The game also has an amazing backstory consisting of secret government experiments, alien artifacts, and religoius cheeki banter.The game also has a multiplayer mode, but is pretty much ""dead space"" in the game now as its player base is now non-existent. The multiplayer is a versus objective mode where the humans try to escape and nercomorphs try to stop them.Up against the other Dead Space games, I'd have to say this one is the best because its a good mix of horror and action, where the first game focused on horror and the thrid game focused on action.I recommend this game and give it a 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I recommend this game those all who's liking the mystic sci-fi stories and games. Good things: -Good visuals. -Good playthrough. -Good sotry. Bad Things: -As the mystic has getting solved the scary things getting less. -If you want continue the 'Dead Space' storyline, you sadly need install an another aplication onto your operation system, because the 'EA Games' has decided the future didn't publish their games on the 'Steam'. Bad thing, I guess.			",96,2,0,7,3,0,3

												Now, this is what I call a worthy successor: louder and longer, but at the same time not too different!When I started the game I thought it would have been a mediocre sequel, but this wasn't the case here, as I was pleasantly surprised with Dead Space 2's quality.Graphics and music were pretty much similar to the first game's, but in this case that was a good thing, since the original was an excellent space horror.Gameplay was also very similar to the first, but with some, well received, improvements. Most of all I appreciated the new Zero Gravity controls, in which you had full freedom to move and levitate in open space, whereas in the first one you could only jump from one surface to another.Of course, new weapons and suits were also added, which was nice, though I ended up mostly sticking with the weapons I had gotten accustomed with in the first game... and I wore a suit that was a lot reminiscent of the first one's also. Old habits die hard, I guess.The enemies were, too, a lot similar to the original Dead Space's, but some new ones made an appearance as well, most notably a big necromorph called The Tormentor, which chases you for a good part of the game.The story is good,  set 3 years after the events of the original game and manages to bring the atmosphere to life in a very similar tone as the latter. The game, as a true sequel would demand, is also 3 chapters longer than its predecessor and, while at times it felt a bid dragged, does what it does very well.What maybe could be described as my only complaint would be the fact that it sacrificed the first's scary and tense atmosphere for more flashy effects and action sequences, filling it with plenty QTE-like battles, probably influenced from the trend created by modern action games, such as the God of War or Assassin's Creed series, which, in itself, isn't necessarily a bad thing, if it wasn't for the horror factor that suffered a bit from this.In a few words the game became, as I wrote in the first sentence, ""louder"" than the previous one, as most sequels tend to be.However, that said, the game still remains a lot scary and is a worthy successor of the Dead Space name, needless to say that there is even a level in which you enter the ""playground"" of the first, the planet-cracker spaceship Ishimura and re-visit some areas you explored the first time around and see how it changed over the years.Last but not least, I remember one of the hardest and most stressing parts of the first game was fighting off a miniboss-like necromorph, called the Hunter, which had infinite regeneration and, as such, could not be killed by normal means and you had to run for your life, while fighting other necromorphs as well... as you might have guessed, this pricky son of a gun makes an appearance in the final levels of the second game as well, this time called the Ubermorph, lowering a lot your survival rate!Such a pity that the third game doesn't exist on Steam and that, as such, this is my final review here for the franchise, but, for what it's worth, Dead Space 2 was really a blast and a good horror ride, recommended for all of you, fans of chills and thrills!

												Overall score? 96/100. TL;DR? Takes the first game > Adds a load of content to it > Continues the story from the last game > Adds in Multiplayer. In-depth Review:In the world of Third Person Survival Shooters, this game comes out on top for being both challenging and fun. However, much like the first game, I didn't find it to be all that scary like most people do. Sure, it had it's moments and my heart rate did occasionally jump up drastically in some situations, but overall I think the scare factor for this game, and the previous one is pretty low, but that's nothing I would take off points for. The story line is pretty much what I expected (Oh noes, they made another marker and became obsessed with the crap because the alien signal told them to. Now Isaac has to go on another journey to destroy it. Sound Familiar?) but even with that said, they added in a few major plot twists and mysteries which made it about 100% more unique. Re-playability also seems to be better, since there are 2 new difficulty levels, one of which only lets you save 3 times throughout the playthrough, and on top of that resets everything you worked for in the last playthrough, such as weapon and suit upgrades.Graphics/Visuals haven't improved, but honestly, they didn't need to. I mean, I would have liked them to increase the texture quality on the characters and the various suits that Isaac wears, but It's no big deal.Multiplayer in this game is also very unique and I would totally play it more, but unfortunately it's quite dead, it's almost impossible to get a full game going unless you have 7 friends to play with.

												Dead Space 2 is one of my all-time favorites. It does storytelling in a way that a lot more games need to learn to do. Dead Space 2 foregoes most of the first game's insistence that it is a horror game in favor of another type of story that is more focused on atmosphere and storytelling. You're Isaac. Isaac isn't a silent protagonist anymore, and Isaac isn't an everyman. You don't feel scared for you own life, you worry for Isaac's. This is Isaac's story, and the over-the-shoulder camera serves to emphasize that. You're a passenger in Isaac's story. There's no choices, there's no alternate paths. You're a witness to his story and it is your job to keep him alive. Even if the story itself isn't amazing, the way it is told is something I have yet to see matched in any game.

PROS:+ action-horror atmosphere+ various new enemy types+ weapons & their upgrades+ save & inventory systems+ level design+ epic boss fights+ great storyCONS:- jump scares stop being interesting after a while- couple of graphical & AI glitches- EA account neededComment:As a sequel to Dead Space this game does some things better, some worse and others just differently. It is still a console port but a far better one than the previous game. Most things they changed from the previous game are ""give and take"". For example your character is voiced now which means less roleplay as Isaac. But at the same time the dialogue gives him more depth and it helps narrate his story. Less horror and more action is the result - the game is less scary but counters this with more enemies, more boss fights and more trigger-finger situations. So it still is quite thrilling but in a different way. The game begins right away in a necromorph infested space station and Isaac has to make alliances and try to escape. The cast of a body horror movie is back again in the form of various old and new monster types. Gore, blood and decapitations also return in their previous glory, maybe even more graphic in some parts. The anticipation here is not IF something will come crashing in but WHAT and HOW MANY OF IT. The monster variety is just enough to keep this formula fresh. Story is great with better narrative this time around and you actually care for Isaac (and Ellie). There are some cheesy parts but these can be forgiven. Level design is awesome and so are the boss battles. As mentioned, the amosphere is more action-packed than scary a lot of the time but it still has those ""adrenaline rush"" moments. Overall you feel more like an action hero than a survivor but inbetween all that mayhem, gore and monsters it doesn't matter. The main point is that the game is fun. Recommended!P.S.: the game time here does not show how much time I really spent on this game, I am switching up my CD/DVD collection with digital distribution so I bought Dead Space 2 again, to try it out on Steam			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

What I liked: Bringing back the Dead Space with more weapons( love the javelin and contact weapon, OMG so good) More suit variety New enemies that offer variety, with returning ones as well No terrible PC port like the first game It's the most similar to the first game, but way better in every single respect( unlike the 3rd game)What You Need to Know: No issues like the first one, controller works out the gate, and no 30 fps lock  I beat the game quicker than most people on their first time would( Already played the game on console) No one plays the multiplayer, so don't get it for that. Plus who really gets this game for the online feature On first launch, it wants to login with your EA account. I did, but don't know what singleplayer things you would miss out on if you don't use it. Think it's for the online feature Does have the hardcore difficulty which is a really nice challenge for the ""hardcore"" fans, limited save counts :OCompared to the original:  More weapons and new special effects when upgraded enough  Zero G is way more awesome now, you can move in 3D space, bringin in new challenges and fun  Issac does talk, so with that is more cutscenes, but overall it didn't bother me too much  No map, instead the stations are found the same way as the objective  Final Boss fight was not as cool as or hard as the first game You can respec your power nodes for whatever reason nowMy Score:A+Price:$5Completed in:8 hours( This is alot faster than new players would get)Games similar:  Dead Space 1 only Doom 3 ",224,25,1,13,29,1,28

												Scary? No. Fun? Hell yes.Let me start by saying this is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. I could spend a half hour just looking out the windows onto the city. But Dead Space 2 can take you from awe to terror in just a few seconds. The necromorphs are grotesquely designed, and the action is perfectly choreographed. Sure, there are plenty of jump out of the closet scares, but I would NOT call this a survival horror game, simply because you're a walking gun cabinet. Necromorphs end up falling apart after a few credits are spent on upgrades. But for the most part, watching your enemies being torn to shreds compensates for those false claims. The hardest thing for me is to identify any faults. If I had to complain about anything, it would be the multiplayer. Although it looks good on paper, I found it to be very dry and uninteresting, as if Visceral missed a few key elements in designing it.			",137,16,7,9,8,1,13

												Those new to the horror genre might get a spook from it, but veterans won't be scared in the least.  It's Western horror, which often has relied on attempts to startle the player and turn their stomach with disturbing images and gore.  However, I couldn't stop playing, due to the fact that your very squishy foes are very fun to blow apart with an array of unique weaponry and tactics.  The game and interface flows beautifully and you will never see a single load time breaking the immersion, aside from getting killed, so the better you do, the harder the game will be to put down.  If veterans of the horror genre are looking to get their fix, this may not deliver, but if it's a survival monster mash you're craving, pick this one up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh god yes this is one of the best games I have ever played. And it's infectious, when you start playing it just sucks you in and doesn't let you go off that easy. If it didn't have savepoints you would be just sucked in and finish it in one run, and after it you probably wouldn't be able to sleep the entire week. Although it's a horror game first, it has some very good black humour hidden in posters and body placements troughout the game and even when scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you will just laugh and laugh and realize that you actually became schizophrenic after that eyestab. This game really shows off how horrifying some things can be. It can be subtle, like a baby crying behind a locked door on an empty floor, or go full-scale and just stab you in the ♥♥♥♥ing eye.TL;DR Great game, scars for life, recommend to everyone.

												Dead Space 2 is arguably one of the best action horror games that any lover of horror genre games should make sure to  experience firsthand. The RPG elements mixed in with the TPS storytelling mesh perfectly with one another to bring an unforgettable sequel akin to its equally great predecessor. That being said, the two games are both good but in different ways: The first Dead Space was more of a creepy horror game with action being its sidekick, while Dead Space 2 is more of a sci-fi shooter with some creepy aspects to it; there was an inverse, but nothing was inherently lost from the overall gameplay. However, your own opinion may vary depending upon your susceptibility to being scared, and this game certainly does not disappoint in that department--The game puts you straight into the shocking, fast-paced, frightening action right from the beginning. Dead Space 2 also polishes up a few facets from the last game such as a better zero-g flight system and controls, more weapons, and more enemies in order to bring a more expansive, smooth gameplay to the player. Of course, there are still a few funny glitches such as the physics and movements of the many cadavers scattered throughout each chapter; it is almost like gmod decided to visit space in a sense. Also, gameplay is very similar to the first game (as you should expect): smash and dismember everything in your path or be dismembered and eviscerated yourself. Simple survival rules to say the least by Darwinian Standards. I definitely recommend picking up this game if you liked the first Dead Space. I do not even have to go through the five stages of grief after finishing this game to come to the conclusion that Dead Space 2 easily deserves a 9/10. So keep your ""eye out"" for when it goes on sale in the Steam Store. The only thing I have a problem with is the fact that Dead Space 3 has yet to be released on Steam...so pick it up on console or get yourself an Origin Account in the meanwhile until that fateful day comes if you cannot wait after finishing Dead Space 2.

Dead Space 2 (SP Review Only)Altman be Praised!Here we have the Sequel to Dead Space 1:After unearthing a strange artifact known as the Marker, Isaac finds himself on the Sprawl, a giant space station in orbit around Saturn. Unable to remember how he got here and plagued with demented visions of his dead girlfriend Nicole, he must survive another nightmarish outbreak of Necromorphs as he fights his way towards an answer he hopes will end all the chaos.I like this Setting hmmm.Its set on a Space Station! thats orbits Saturn..interesting!


Hero of The Sprawl 
A Screenshot of Dead Space 2
By: Jaeger




So This Game Has many new and improved features from its predeseccor such as many new suits, new wepaons, new suit abilities and new enemies to name a few. In my honest opinion, his Game takes some steps away from the Bare Horror Genre and mixes it with a bit of mass effect's Special effects. (Both made by EA, hmmmm.) its quite an action packed ride albeit a very short one! There are moments in this game where it gets very fast paced, there are other moments where its very Gory and Shocklingly Tense (In true Dead Space Style). After all, Improvements are the Main things you want to hear after you hear the Word-Sequel. So without Further ado, heres the Good and Bad, simplified..Pros:+the Story is Short, for casual gamers this is Good News! (Approx 10-12 hours on Normal)+Simplified Mechanics means that Tutorials take less time! yay.Graphics feel smoother than DS1 and much more mellow colours/themes in levels.+The Battle isnt just on the sprawl, it also spans a unique conflict in Isaac's Mind, His Mental Health is Greatly affected from the events of the previous game (No Spoilers here) and any chance of ""recovery"" is......Absolutely Obliterated.+Plot (although short) is interesting and keeps you interested in the developments and futures for many of the characters.+So many Upgrades to Choose from (Suits, health, air, armour, ammo and the tough but rewarding ""pearl"" that is the Work-Bench.+So many Weapon Variations too! There are 11 Main guns in the Game but each have about 3 different variations for elemental effects or special features that belong with a special suit. Lots of work clearly done here.+So many New Enemies! yay, there are specific enemies for dark areas, zero-G, Open Halls and even Plastered on Walls! (Euurgh.)+Voice Acting is Slightly above average, giving Isaac a voice was a risky decision but EA pulled it off alright in the end i think.+The Atmosphere and Environments! of Course, many new areas are seen in the Story that were only mentioned in the first game. Obviosly the biggest one being a massive Church of Unitology! this really gives a deep insight into the Culture of the Cult members and even some instances of segregation because of it! This kind of detail is rare for a game, especially for a Horror!+Speaking of Environments, you can now fly/jet around in space in some parts. the controls took me a while to learn however.+While this might not be a true down to the roots-horror game, its definietely a Gory Ride. Once again Dead Space lives up to its R18 Rating. One Scene Worth Mentioning is the MANUAL Laser eye surgery segment...DONT Screw up!, 'Nuff Said+Im a Sucker for Hard Difficulties in Horror games, and luckily Dead Space 2 didnt dissappoint: The Impossible Mode from Dead Space 1 has grown into a real man now! Hard-core Gamers can now experience the (Wisely named) Hard-Core mode! The Main feature of this mode is that you now only have 3 Saves to use throughout th whole story, this combined with regular things like OP enemies, low Health and Little to NO Supplies make it a very challenging experience, almost...a Horror Game.


YouTube™ Video: DEAD SPACE 2 executions multiplayer 

			Views: 10,179		



Cons:-Its Too Bloody Short! its a breeze on easy and normal. only on hard or above do you really see the kind of experience it intended! Gathering Supplies Really makes the Game a lot more challenging and takes away from the Constant action-Cutscenes are very Linear and suddenly turn int QTE's when you least expect! (Timing is everything!)-Some Lag/Frame Rate drops that i experienced. (around 2 per playthrough, not too bad)-Theres hardly any Boss Battles in the game! and when there is, they are nowhere close to the unique battles that DS1 had!-Because its a very short game, the time to understand Isaac's ""persona"" and motivations is drastically reduced. Action>""Mind Battle"" with Nicole>Action>Plot>Cutscene>Boss>Action>Repeat. Thats basically a cycle of events really.-An Abundance of Ammo is great! but DS2 has the opposite.. (in the harder modes this is changed obviously.) This doesnt help the Horror Name of DS2 and really changes it into an Action-Packed one instead. Which is True! For Some people this is good, for others its bad. But the Atmosphere overall doesnt Compare with the Confines of the Ishimura or Tight Spaces in Zero-G from the First Game. Instead, it seems like a Rushed Plot which has good directions for the story but is cut short after the Final Boss (Great Boss though) and isnt explained Clearly. Which is exactly what the Third game is for, wow!! Bloody EA...Final Thoughts:I think this game makes many improvments in common areas, but NOT Atmosphere and the Mysteriousness and Scariness that it held deep inside the Ishimura! Story is standard really, which sets itself up for a third game very well. Not as much Backstory as the First game. Which is strange because there is a 3 Year Gap inbetween 1 and 2! BUT Since im such a fan, here is the Order of the DS Series! (To Read, Play and watch!):Martyr (Book) Dead Space (Graphic Novel)Downfall (Animated Film)Extraction (Wii Game)First GameSalvage (Graphic Novel)Aftermath (Graphic Novel)Dead Space (Mobile Game)Ignition (Xbox Minigame)Second GameThird/Final Game + the DLC  Hope that was Helpful.Anyway I rate this game a 7.5/10!An interesting sequel with a heavy Focus on Isaac's Mind and Unitology! as well as many minor improvements..http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=582353606Hope you liked this Review for the last Dead Space game on steam! ;( Leave a Comment with any questions below, as usual :D-Kyle ",82,13,0,3,2,1,2

												Dead Space 2 is a gigantic, flying leap over Dead Space 1 in many ways.Pros:  Dozens of gameplay refinements from Dead Space 1: Issac moves much easier and aims much faster, with animations getting almost complete overhaul ( for example, Issac's badass backhand is now replaced with a much faster punch, and his stomp comes out way faster and is much easier to spam). You can now pick up Necromorph blades or rods and shoot them into enemies, allowing you to deal with individual foes much easier and save ammo. New enemy types keep combat fresh, like introducing the long-range debuffing Puker or the agile Stalker to keep the player on their toes. New weapons make for a much more interesting combat experience, with interesting ideas like the Javelin Gun or the Detonator alongside classics like the Plasma Cutter, Line Gun and Pulse Rifle.  Beautiful graphics and sound: The game, while showing it's currently five year old age in a hell of a lot of places (like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRM, and long distance objects looking like crap) has some absolutely beautiful locations- standouts include the Government Sector, the Unitologist Church/Residence and more. Lighting effects are at their prime here, with detailed, colourful mood lighting that adds to the setpieces: having the only light be Issac's helmet glow is an effect that REALLY should have been used more often as it simply looks beautiful.  Good Story: Having Issac be voiced is a contentious decision, but I think it works. It helps that his voice acting is pretty good, and the story is much more engaging with him being voiced. Issac being mute in the last game was something I disliked, so it's nice to see him express himself here. The story is much more personal and cinematic this time around, and it has a good resolution at the end. Replayability: Don't let my 7-ish hours ingame fool you- i've beaten DSII at least 4 times- 3 on PS3 and once on PC and  it's still a blast! The myriad of weapons, unique combat encounters and wide tools almost demand multiple playthroughs, and the new game plus of this game is on the same tier of Resident Evil 4- just as fun as the first time through, though way easier. My total time with this game has been at least 23 hours total across all the playthroughs, and i've only spent about $20 on this game across buying it twice. It's got a lot of content.Cons:Too much action: The unfortunate side of things is that DSII is rarely scary. While DSI wasn't too scary either, it at least tried. DSII is full on action from start to finish, like Alien to Aliens. However, the truly spooky parts, like the first encounter with the stalkers in the church or the appearance of an old pal from DSI towards the end of the game are very memorable. It's a shame that the relentless action kinda ruins the atmosphere, because the creepy atmosphere in many locations can make your skin crawl. Horrible Install: Despite running very well, the setup process for this game can be a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Seriously, it took me at least half an hour to get it working, and that's with no issues on my end.Overall: An excellent action horror experience- by cutting off the fluff and refining the core of Dead Space combat, a truly great game was made. A classic everyone should try.			",186,26,0,13,8,1,16

												Sequel to one of my favourite horror games of all time, wonderful game and stays up there with DS1. Great game, the only negative part I have to say is that the Single Player DLC from the Console Versions are not availible on this version, albeit you get all the Mini DLC packs for free.. buuuut if you're playing the game for the first time, don't usethat stuff.

												I don't play many EA games anymore due to their separation from Valve, but Dead Space 2 is definitely a worthy successor to the original. There isn't anything really new gameplay wise, which isn't a bad thing. Basically suit and weapon upgrades, moving from point A to point B, and shooting anything that pops out at you.The story events take place several years later after the original game and makes a lot of references back to that story so if you haven't played the first one, you're going to be missing out on what happened before.The line cutter was my favorite weapon in the first game and it still ended up being my favorite in this one, although it was pretty satisfying to stick an enemy to the wall with a javelin.Another great third-person, horror, sci-fi, action shooter.

												Dead Space 2 is in some ways a big improvement over it's predecessor. - The controls in DS2 are much more fluid and reactive. This was one of the biggest downfalls of the original. Good job.- Isaac actually talks in DS2 so you get a sense of his personality instead of playing a mute character. Good job.- Removed the overly obnoxious heavy breathing of the no-oxygen areas, and cleaned up the zero-gravity areas to be more fun and easier to control. Good job.Overall though, the first DS offered a stronger atmosphere and sense of helplessness than DS2, which surprised me a bit. Also the way the chapters are done in DS2 didn't seem to make much sense or have a rhyme or reason. For example, you could just crawl out of a vent (with nothing major happening to advance the story) and you just randomly entered a new champter. How does crawling out of a vent trigger a new chapter? It wasn't really a big deal and didn't effect the game, but it made the game feel like it was lacking direction.I felt like DS2 suffered greatly from poor character development. DS1 actually had decent character development and I had a pretty good sense of their personalities. DS2 took a step back from that.The gameplay is nearly identical to the first one with the addition of a few new items you can use kinesis on for combat. I was hoping for some really cool boss battles, but I was disappointed once again (I feel like EA could be so creative with these monsters that they could make some insanely cool boss fights. How did this not happen?). In some ways DS2 was better than DS1, but in other ways it took a step back. While the game is somewhat fun and I recommend it, I don't think it is the strongest franchise. DS2 takes about 12-15 hours to complete. 7.5/10Please upvote this review if you found it useful :)			",66,50,1,8,4,0,7

												Short version: An improvement on the original in almost every way, tight and adrenaline fueled combat, one of the only video game gun upgrade systems that seems both justified and interesting and generally pretty fun to play. Just don't expect to be scared or to give a single♥♥♥♥♥♥about any of the characters. 8/10. If you can get it on sale for $10 or less I'd say it's a must buy.I bought this on sale for $5 and generally speaking I'd say I would've payed more. The gameplay is loads of fun and combat can be very, very hectic, in a good way. The zero gravity sections from the first game have been massively improved and are now actually fun to do and what I would generously call ""puzzles"" are few and far between which is good in a game like this. The graphics are very good and most of the settings you play through look gorgeous. On a related note the Dead Space series' one innovation, the completely menu diagetic interface, returns and is as neat a novelty as ever. There are quite a few action setpieces that, while maybe not memorable, are certainly very impressive and a blast to play through, especially since many of them will take a new player completely by surprise. The only downside to the game is it's pretentions to scaryness. The original Dead Space could almost manage to be scary with its constant dark hallways and feelings of isolation but Dead Space 2 just seems to be trying far, far too hard. The soundtrack loses it's damn mind everytime an enemy spawns, ruining any kind of surprise, and refuses to die down until the very last enemy dies, instantly alerting the player to the fact that there's nothing more to worry about. The game relies almost entirely on jump scares, the vast majority of which will be spotted long beforehand by even the most remotely savvy of players and the few that aren't at all telegraphed will probably have more players laughing than jumping (An alarm clock jumpscare, really?). The game also tries desperately to up the ante of the first game's monsters with, get this, child enemies and even BABY enemies both of which come across as more humerous than terrifying. The first 3-4 hours of gameplay also has an almost pathological tendency to introduce characters only to see them murdered horibbly within a matter of minutes (or in several cases, seconds) which means that most players will never start to care about the actually important characters because they'll be assuming a quick-but-painful death in their near future. So while the game is great fun and certainly worth it's price, don't expect a truly scary experience unless you're a twitchy coward. Oh and there's multiplayer too but I never tried it because honestly who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥-Also, it's important to note that this steam release apparently comes with all the various weapon and armor packs free of charge, all of which can be purchased in-game at the very first store you come across at an unbelievable price of 0 dollars. I recommend against using any of them on your first playthrough because they break game balance over their knee and ruin what little tension the game managed.			",321,108,0,50,33,2,38

												If you want the TRUE ""Dead Space 2"" experience, i suggest you play this on Zealot, i destroyed the first game with no deaths cause the difficulty was laughable, even if the atmosphere was good i was swimming in ammo & credits, with no feeling of danger what-so-ever.But NOW things have changed, prepare for a real challenge cause Zealot is no walk in the park, you will be on the edge through all game, forced to scavenge, use kinesis, retreat for your life, actually think things through, and more. It's very intense but also very rewarding. Atmosphere & gameplay is as good as ever, highly recommended.			",93,2,0,7,0,0,6

												After completing it a second time I believe I can fully review this now.I'll start off by not mentioning the horror, But the story. Coming form Dead space 1 to this the stroy flows through really nicely. Its a great story and like number 1 you find a lot of backstory about whats happening throughout. The horror. Well In the begining its fantastic. A few nicely put jump scare moments and some really scary mecromorhps get your heart going and you find yourself scouring and survivng the best you can. As a con however near the end the horror looses its edge as it become more action non stop style. But its the end and its expected. The anticipation for the end of the story covers it nicely however and you dont really miss the horror at the end.The comabt mechanics are spot on. All i can recommend is try using different weapons as much as possible. A lot of people say you will only use the pulse rifle and plasma cutter. But if you buy the other weapons you can have much more fun & they are more effective. Such as the javelin gun (A personal favorite).Overall Its a 9.5/10 for me.Highly Recommened.

												Dead Space 2 is one of my favorite games, right below the first Dead Space.Pros-Great Story-Isaac is no longer an intern for other characters.-More Necromorphs!-Zero-G areas are awesome. (No more jumping from place to place, instead you have boosters.)-Wide selection of suits and weapons, with great upgrades.-Controls are better that the first game.-Interesting Characters.-Action sequences are great and don't take away from the horror (LOOKING AT YOU DEAD SPACE 3!)-Graphics look great even in 2016/2017-Isaac is no longer a silent protagonist, and isn't annoying (for the most part.).-Framerate is smooth/doesn't drop very much. -Includes armor and weapon DLC packs.Cons-Jump scares lose the scare factor as you evolve into the terminator in space.-Lots of console exclusive DLC-Sometimes throws hordes of necromorphs at you, unlike its predecessor.All considered, 9.9/10.

												Despite some technical issues with this slightly questionable Steam port - including a shop chock-full of ""unlocked"" goodies which would render the game impossibly easy, were you to indulge in them - this is yet another top-rate ""survival horror"" game set among the stars.     Like most horror game sequels it ""opens up"" the setting to something far more epic than a mere Haunted House romp, but whether this is a good or bad thing is of course up to individual tastes.  A part of me still votes in favour of the ""purity"" of the somewhat narrower setting of the earlier game, but if they HAD to mess all that up with a sequel, you really couldn't have asked for a better job.     Looking forward to the third one, though the question is slowly arising:  How many more Dead Spaces can they do before the premise becomes a tad exhausted?  Only time will tell...Verdict: 9/10.

												Just as good, if not better than the first game. If I am being honest I am only recalling the story for the game while thinking of this review, and while its not terrible its not memorable. But the atmosphere of the game is just as if not creepier than the first game. Gameplay is basically the same as the first game, but with a little bit more polish. So if you wanted something different you wont be getting it, and thats not a bad thing. And as I said with the first games review, the games still hold up when as a truly good horror game due to its art and design. If you liked the first game you should be happy with this one, if you haven't played the first game I would recommend playing that one first as its just a good.			",140,12,1,10,10,1,12

												Dead Space 2 is a terrific follow-up to Dead Space. The game looks very good & this time depth was given to the lead character Issac, which was a ballsy move considering he never spoke in the first game and we seen his face once, but in the end it payed off remarkably well. Even more terrifying than the first game and a welcome introduction of more horrifying creatures, the game had me tempted to turn down the difficulty just to calm the nerves.Multiplayer is very bad and I would nearly prefer if it wasn't there at all, it can be exscused because its single-player, which its made for, it so excellent.There was something in the original that makes me prefer it but this is an amazing follow-up to an amazing game.8/10			",154,39,1,11,21,3,11

												Having never played any Deadspace game, it felt reminiscent of Half-life and the Alien film smashed together. The atmosphere and environment art was stellar, filled with detail, dynamic lighting and smoke effects. It's not too scary or predictable, though there are some jump scares.  Most of the tension comes from the spooky music, the way the enemies move, and how danger suddenly spawns or flanks you. There's also some great gore scenes. The combat was very satisfying, and it was unique to focus on dismembering limbs and stomping on stuff instead of doign flat contact damage.  Overall, it is a very well put together game.The parts I didn't like were that enemies pop up unrealistically close to you, and is often what's scary - that something loud and dangerous is suddenly right next to you.  The weapon system was a little overwhelming because of all the options. You ride in upwards of 100 elevators and manual saving felt tedious as the game went on. Some of the story was nonsensical - worthy of being made fun of.  There's some gravity gun-esque gameplay that felt tired and out of place, and sometimes you have to mash a button to get away from an enemy.			",112,20,2,5,4,0,6

												Like it's predecessor, Dead Space 2 takes place in a horror survival scenario where Isaac Clarke, our protagonist, must combat multitudes of enemies using his weapons, the surrounding environment, and even the sharp appendages of defeated enemies to survive. Unlike in the predecessor, Isaac Clarke (whom had rarely if not ever spoke in Dead Space 1) was now fleshed out and given a personality (and an enjoyable one at best). The gore is still everywhere in this game and it lives up to Dead Space 1. The game has about 10-12 hours of gameplay with replayability in it's NewGame+ and Hardcore mode, where you only get three saves and barely enough health and ammo to live. Give this game a go if you have a bit of extra money in your wallet, you won't be disapointed.			",216,17,2,13,14,1,7

												Well, I just finished Dead Space 1 and Dead Space 2 in a row on normal. Considering the lack of time I have between work and family, I must say I am surprised.Played tons of games in the last 30y of gamings ( started with c64) and so I can be picky. I knew Dead Space were good games but I don't usually like horror games but maybe I should revisit this statement as I really enjoyed the ride.Both games are engaging, both in story and gameplay. It's tense, it's well balanced from beginning to end  and if you don't read any spoiler, it feels like a journey.I do obviously recommend to buy and if you like the FPS where you feel you are engaged like you life depends on it with interesting weapon mechatic, then you'll love this game. The loot & character progression is simple but it works, The maps level are good and the overall fun factor is great. you just have to hide it from your wife and kids if you know what I mean :)glad I finally decided to give the franchise a try ( summer sale)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's safe to assume at this point in my life that I'm not a big fan of survival horror games considering that, for example, I've only played one of the many Resident Evil games out there, the fith one, considered by many the less scarier in the series. I think the main reason is that I'm easily scared and playing this kind of games for me is like being tortured, my heart is always beating at 150% and I'm always ready to jump off my chair.Everything changed after Dead Space. I've always been a sci-fi fan and when I heard back in 2008 that a sci-fi game, located in space and full of alien like monsters then I didn't care anymore about my heart....or my chair. The fear never disapeared, but the game..oh boy..was so enjoyable. Now the sequel, Dead Space 2. I remember that I read some years ago an article stating that Dead Space 2 was to Dead Space as Aliens was to Alien, nothing better to describe it. In Dead Space you are in a spaceship, a very large one indeed but still a spaceship, in Dead Space 2 the scale is much bigger and the amount of monsters and scary moments are increased in the same proportion. Even today, being a 2011 game with somewhat outdated graphics, this like the first one are 2 of the best survival horror titles out there, real jewels.Dead Space 3 was good, for some reasons, not incredible like the first two but either way I hope to see sooner rather than later a new Dead Space title.

												First of all the actual game is awesome! It's a really great story that mixes strange religious cultism with horror, and leaves enough of the backround ambiguous to make it mysterious. The game also runs silky smooth on PC, and is a far better port than the original was. The link in with EA has been HIGHLY exaggerated also. Literally all you have to do is sign into an EA account, which many people probably have if they own a console, or have ever used Origin. It's really not as big a deal as everyone says.The two major flaws however are as follows: 1) You can only install this game a certain number of times so be carfeful not to uninstall unless you're finished with the game. It wasn't a huge problem for me as I got it on sale and only planned to do a quick run through, but for people who like to, you know, KEEP WHAT THEY FREAKING PAID FOR, or are just struggling with HDD space it may be a problem.2) The second flaw is kind of mind boggling. They must have included all the DLC for free with the game, because when you hit the very first store in the game you get access to all of the weapons and armour in the game straight away. Again this wasn't a big deal for me as I had already played this game on console and this basically gave me a free NG+ to run through the campaign, but I can see this seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥some people off, especially new players.All in all the game is great, and if you have no problem with the gripes i've mentioned then you may as well get it. However maybe if you've never played it before, buy it from origin as the DLC may not be included there, and you might get the full normal experience.Game - 9/10This Version  - 7/10			",121,18,2,18,8,0,14

												Dead Space 2 is a worthwhile sequel that continues the story of Isaac Clarke and his  fight against the necromorphs. The locales are more diverse than the first game, but the atmosphere is still reminiscent of the original game's dark and creepy corriders. If you enjoyed the first Dead Space in terms of gameplay and the story then its sequel is a no-brainer. Dead Space 2 also has one of the most gut-wrenching scenes in gaming history where you...Well, it's towards the game's conclusion. I'm sure you'll notice it when you come across it.

												Game is good, that much is true but it feels wholly different from Dead Space 1. I must admit in some aspects that a positive and while it doesn't come anywhere close to sucking as bad as Dead Space 3, something just... rubs me wrong.It's an excellent Action-Survival Horror game. It's controls are... designed for the console to say the least but I can look past that. The graphics are tight and although it continues the jump scare heavy hallways, at least it tries.Pick it up, probably wait for a sale though.			",673,155,32,92,55,5,98

												Dear Dead Space™ 2 review reader,The Dead Space™ 2  game will be forever imbedded into my brain. No regrets buying it with the combo game pack (along with Dead Space™ ) FOR PC.I had the intention of playing it with the upgraded plasma cutter from Dead Space™ 1, however, am still clueless if DS2 managed to detect and include that information into the in-game store. Nevertheless, I started the game in anticipation with the memories of my experience with DS1; on Zealot mode. No less. No necromorph is going to come up and shake my hand in any difficulty, so what the heck, right?As a graphic art enthusiast, the fluent user interface of the menu/ingame, colour scheme, stunning artwork on buildings and scenery, character a.i. and attention to detail (especially object animation and interaction) was the cream of the crop for me. From the hours spent on developing the game, you'd  know  that they loved creating it as much as you will love playing it.As usual, the game starts off with an action-packed bounded sequence which really gets the blood flowing. If you had had a break from DS1 after a while... this will just jolt you back into ""reality"". Absolutely love the way developers give you a moment of silence now and then with the chills going down your spine while you raid and explore the beautiful Titan Station. Where there are necromorphs... you're definitely to be on the edge of the seat the whole time... forgetting whether you have  collected that stasis pack at the corner or checked that inconspicious pile of janitorial equipment at the medical deck of the  USG Ishimura . The storyline is particularly intriguing and at times, marvelling with unexpected twists.This game is action-packed (sometimes crazy overly), horrifying and gruelling at times. It ends in the most  cheapest bossfight imaginable... but absolutely DOABLE . Remember, in any Dead Space game, never... ever.... give up.. So without further ado• What I totally dig:  - The Graphics (Character, Suits, Scenery, Buildings, etc)  - The Challenges (Necromorphs, Puzzles, Quick-time Events)  - The Gear and Guns (Exsisting Guns and Suits in-game as well as the Extra Content Gear instore)  - The Unexpected Surprises (Diamond Semiconductors, Jump attacks)  - Extended Breadcrumb Locator menu (Loved it, includes nearest Save Station, Bench & Store)  - The Experience (In-game sound, atmosphere, Zero-G baby!)• What I did not quite get:  - The most obvious glitch in-game which happens for me, was that when you press the Tab Key while holding the Aim button (right mouse button), Isaac will be in a constant state of aiming even though you press everything else including shoot. This brings other interactive issues, which you can't do while aiming. Do Not Save the game in this state.The only way, I found out to undo this glitch, is to restart DS2 application and reload a previous save game. The glitch also happens at the medical deck where a triggered cutscene happens. So if you were aiming, again.. restart DS2 Application and load last saved game. This glitch also happens in DS1.  - The last boss battle,  was cheap. Many people had suggested to use the Contact beam or Detonator for ""easy""  boss defeat, but then again, why have all those other awesome guns? Experiencing it in Zealot mode, it was frustrating... 25 tries, or more. but I was resolute in getting the job done with my souped up Javelin, Line gun and Pulse Rifle for the ""other"" challenge. It was still a success, just that because of timing or luck... probably both. Would have preferred a better boss fight. • Personal Tips while Playing Dead Space™ 2:  -   Always be inquisitive.  This can trigger special cutscenes or find yourself that item that gives you the extra edge.  -   Keep calm.  Very often, you'd feel yourself freeze up from the fright. Remember, Isaac is equiped with a stasis module. So, if things get too intense, mesh that C key and dodge the hell out of there!  -   ""Run, Isaac, Run!""  Keep moving! Avoid any proximity from necromorphs or hazards. A hit caused by a necromorph can slow you down intensively and waste those precious seconds from regaining control of the character. This in turn will cause swarming. In Zealot mode, first few times being hit will be OHKs (One Hit Kills).  -   Gun Hard-on.  The weapons in the game are amazing and it is always a shame to not try out any of them, if not all of them. Let go and try to have some quality time with the others. It will be worth the high.  -   Watercooler discussion.  Take a break once in a while. The game gets extremely addictive at some points and frustrating at other points. Having fresh sessions per chapter helps and makes it enjoyable rather than repetitive.Hope this review has been helpful. Have a great time playing Dead Space™ 2 and Good Luck!DS2 Gamer,sushibar82©Zealot ModeMarch 2014			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I suppose the obvious thing to say is that if you liked the original Dead Space then you will enjoy the sequel. There are a couple of differences in the gameplay. Where in the original, you were wandering around a spaceship and could ""revisit"" certain areas by using the map, so if you needed ammo, you pulled up the map and found the nearest store (or bench or whatever you needed) In the sequel you just head on forward to the next save point in the style of a more traditional arcade shooter, so the game does lose something there.What the game does really well is to make you feel like a badass with a gun, fighting, shooting and chopping off limbs of various aliens is very satisfying indeed, sadly the progression of the game itself lets the whole thing down. You basically head from one point to the next only to find out that you need to fix/repair/switch on something... and when you have done that, you head off to the next thing that will need to be fixed/repaired/switched on before you can continue on your quest. At around 12-15 hours, the game surprisingly starts to wear out it's welcome at around the 10 hour mark, as it begins to feel like the story is stretched out unnecessarily to make the game just that little bit longer. Just when you think you are done, you have to find yet another switch, or head outside and switch more things on. Luckily, the shooting mechanics are great as are the graphics and sound, so that helps make the experience much more enjoyable.So like I said in the first line, if you enjoyed Dead Space, there is no reason you won't like more of the same. I did!			",859,416,29,87,90,10,94

Dead Space 2 is a pinnacle of horror meets space experiences.Short answer:  You must have it I've now played Dead Space 2 twice, once on console and once again here and it felt just as breathtaking as when I first popped the disc into my 360 a few years ago. A timeless experience that will have you staring wideeyed and open mouthed. It may be the first time you curse at the necromorphs on the screen along with Isaac as you fight your way through 15 chapters.What's changed since Dead Space 1?Better controls.More details graphics.More weapons, and improvements on current ones.A boatload of amazing cutscenes you won't want to miss.A very flushed out story that explains more about the Marker, Earthgov, and the Unitologists.The only complaint, if it's even a complaint, is I wasn't as afraid. But this is the second game, I know where to look and what to expect. If you're looking for fear, you're going to get excitement and thrill. Perhaps this is a fear I'm accustomed to, I don't know. It didn't hinder my experience, but I did walk in having some expectation of fear, but I was given the best roller coaster, toddler stomping, baby blasting, necromorph head punching time of my life.

												One of the greatest games, ever. Probably the scariest game I have ever played, although Dead Space 1 MIGHT be slightly ahead for me. There's one level in here that is BRILLIANTLY horrifying if you're played the first game. Seriosuly one of the best (stressful) experiences I have had playing any game.Fantastic storyBeautiful graphicsAmazing music and sound designI've ended up buying this game on multiple platforms and is still the only game I have completed more than three times. This game is special.... and it'll make you freak the crap out. Even after playing for a few hours I end up with this feeling of unease and dread for a while. Very strange, but shows how much this game impacts the player.			",160,46,4,8,28,1,12

												Great game & to be honest one of my favorite games of all time. Dead Space belongs to those games which series are all good including 1 & 3 too. Great story, good variety of weapons, quite scary, especially if you play it alone in the dark & with loud speakers. All missions are very interesting. I'd recommend it for all cosmos & horror lovers. The only downside of this game is, it has this stupid security restriction which allows you to play this game 5 times after windows install. In short, it has limit & if you try to play it after 5th times installed Windows it won't let you play it & you will need to contact EA support to fix it. It's pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for those who re-installs Windows often. I'm glad, they removed this stupid authorizing thing in Dead Space 3. Other this, game is great, 10/10 from me.			",254,51,18,25,19,9,25

												This game is great! It takes place shortly after the events of DS1 and Isaac still can't catch a break. On top of being thrown back into the nightmare, you watch Isaac slowly lose grip with reality. But then again, who wouldn't under such dire circumstances? The story is further delved into, and the transitions are very smooth. I feel the game handles even better than the first one, and I didn't have any issues in DS1. The game doesn't add a lot of new elements, but why change things when the first one was so good? The game is beautiful, in a a creepy and grotesque way. You visit may different and interesting locations, and you are scared all the way through. There are some very tense moments that can be disturbing for some. Overrall, Dead Space 2 was a great continuation to the first game. Someday when I get the courage I know I will play Dead Space 3.			",114,169,0,22,10,3,18

												Where as Dead Space is a great action horror game(with some survival added in there depending on what diffuculty you are playing), Dead Space 2 is merely good. I found myself playing dead space 1 still being just a little scared even towards the end, but in Dead space 2 I found myself feeling like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ space marine about a quarter of the way in. Don't get me wrong feeling like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ space marine is a cool feeling, it just doesn't belong in a horror game. I do recommend getting this game, but I recommend getting it at half off.

												Good game, not best, but strongly good. Fairly i cant remember end of this game, nevertheless pass less than 8 months when i finished it.

												The biggest con of this game: The gameplay. Don't get me wrong, it was fun, but fighting off necromorphs got tiresome. Concentrating fire on armies of limbs coming at you starts feeling more like a way to simply delay the game's progressing story & dull the gameplay fairly quickly.That said, I did find myself sucked into the game's world (gasp!) & Isaac's now responsive & character-driven story. The environments were far more varied than they were in the first game's depressing series of hulls & hallways & creaking pipes, w/ nurseries & homes & districts full of stores every which way. The cinematic feel was a lot more developed than the first, & I personally love those touches, where control of the protagonist seemlessly disappears or lessens w/ you hardly noticing as the train ye're on comes to a crash or a Space Helicopter™ springs up out of nowheres poppin' caps in ♥♥♥♥♥es' asses.Better than the first in every way, & I'm sad I put it off so long. Also, screw EA, &c.			",728,235,9,105,37,7,84

												I think that this is a great game because it has a great story, the overall fighting mechanics are great, and the intensity of the game really keeps you wondering what will happen next.

												This is a beast of a gameAlthough DS1 players wont feel as scared due to repeated necromorph scares. newer players will feel the heat quite nicely. even on normal you need to be on your toes, the game stays tense with far away groans and objects on the floor emitt way too much noise when walked on.although it may not be pure horror and fear, the new weapons offer creative ways to killl alongside the telekinesis and stasis. there are new necromorphs such as the vomit guy, DO NOT SHOOT HIS HEAD OFF!!! he will blast you with acidic vomitthe story side still stays the same, it tries to make us feel for a character with no character by sourrounding him with tragic eventsoverall, due to the great gameplay and atmosphere, i give it a 8/108/10			",76,4,1,8,10,0,26

												Dead Space 2 is set three years after the events of the first Dead Space game. The game follows protagonist Isaac Clarke's fight against a new Necromorph outbreak on the Sprawl, a space station above Saturn's largest moon, Titan.The game incorporates many aspects of the original Dead Space game that made it such a classic, as a result some may consider the game Dead Space 1.5 rather than Dead Space 2. However, this is not a bad thing. The original game was great and as such, Dead Space 2 fills the large shoes of its predecessor whole and completely. As for the plot, I found it engaging which allowed me to connect with Isaac Clarke and his perilous quest. The gameplay was a smooth and enjoyable experience. In addition, Dead Space 2 was successful in creating a world that left you feeling alone and just one step behind the atrocities of the Necromorph outbreak. The subtle rumblings of a necromorph above you or the eerier silence when entering a new room provided just enough tension to make you jump out your seat when a necromorph jumps out at you.If you thoroughly enjoyed the first Dead Space, Dead Space 2 will not disappoint.

												If my review to dead space 1 put you off, this game is way way better. DS 2 > doom 3 > DS 1. The story is actually really interesting, the puzzles aren't annoying to figure out, the overall gameplay is improved big time. DS1 levels all looked the same and had 4 different textures the entire game. This one is more linear than DS1 (trust me thats a good thing) and the levels all look different. Zero Gravity is improved also. Very goo game.  Also, DS2 is actually a little scary at times.  DS1 is dangerously unscary & boring all through out.			",191,19,8,12,10,1,9

												Just 52 minutes into the game and ironically I love the sheer terror and frightful moments that this game brings to its audience. It's truly breathtaking (literally) to be completely inmersed within the space survival horror setting and the fear of getting ripped apart by a hybrid humanoid alien. However, one of the best aspects of the game so far is the gameplay and it's protagonist surrounded with a mysterious and twisted past. Honestly I rate this game a 9/10 so far based on 52 minutes on gameplay. My expectations keep incrementing as time goes by.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After waking from a coma on a massive space city known as ""The Sprawl"", the lone survivor of a horrific alien infestation finds himself confronting a catastrophic new nightmare. He must kick every Necromorph's teeth out to find a way out, while also getting hunted by his dead, but hot ex-girlfriend. While fighting the Necromorhps and his ex-girlfriend, he meets Ellie, also a hot lady friend. Now Issac has got a alot of company to entertain him on his journey.Graphics and sound speak for them selfs.The story is above average(7,5/10) for a horror game, don't walk in here and expect to see some Telltale's storytelling.The enviorment feels like it is ripped from a horror film. From claustrophobic corridors to huge warehouses filled with alot of creates that block your view. You don't know, there can be a Necromorph on every damn corner.The gameplay is where this game shines. Each Necromorph has got it's weaknesses, you can even remove the limbs from them and shoot back at them. There are mini-games, zero gravity parts, great puzzles and like 50 ways in which Issac can die. The game offers great customize abillity, you can choose weapons that best fit your play style and then upgrade them. This game has atleast 8 hours of gameplay and a huge replay abillity, as it's impossible to upgrade everything in a single playthrough and there is also difficulty settings. The controls on PC are perfect.The only dissapointing part is the multiplayer. It falls flat and doesn't offer anything new. For all I care they could've just removed it.9.5/10 ",83,12,3,4,7,0,8

												Simply amazing. Let me put it at that. One problem with the first game that I didn't like was the fact that Issac never actually talked. But in this one, him talking adds so much more character development and plot potential, which Viscreal used to the fullest extent. The horror is right on with this expecially with your first playthrough with no idea what's around the corner. Tons of great jump scares and ""WTF what is that!?"" moments. Lots of different necromorphs to scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. Just the right difficulty. Nothing too extreme. Despite it's linear progression, it really makes you think about what to do for the best results when you die, which you will if it's your first playthrough. Oh and don't forget about the pure EPICNESS of Issac's quest			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's best to list the pros and cons for this sequel:+The game seems to be more action-packed this time. Its creepy atmosphere is still there, but action- and cutscene sequences are far more and better.+Isaac finally speaks! Also, he has a face! Visceral realised it was best to get rid of the Freeman-esque protagonist and give him some personality. +I found the gameplay better - stasis and telekinesis seemed easier to be used and the RIG does not display unnecessary things such as the map. There are some clever new enemy types, as well.- Unfortunately, the sequel is a bit shorter. Make no mistake - your first playthrough takes roughly 8-10 hours to complete, still, I remember its predecessor to be a bit longer.- No DLC. For some reason its DLC titled Severed was never released on PC. It's a short DLC with a couple of chapters that follows the story of another protagonist and events are taking place earlier than those of DS 2.- Unnecessary multiplayer. By the time I purchased it nobody was playing multiplayer any more. No wonder the game's 3rd episode got rid of this mode. It was completely unnecessary.Dead Space 2 is still a very good game. The negative list I included is all related to minor things - overall, this is a superb sequel to a horror game that is best played at night with the headset on. The experience is best with players watching Dead Space Aftermath, an animated feature film that is set just before of events of the game.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												Let me start by saying this game is bloody brilliant, at first i was a little edgy on it despite the amazing reviews simply becasue horror is so predictable. However i gave the game its chance and im dam glad i did.The game has brilliant ideas such as the telekinetic device that allows you to do all sorts in and out of combat, the general shooting and killing feels very intense when being swarmed by enemies and you have to reload at an adrenaline rishing moment. The game keeps you on your toes without fail all the time. Not to mention the fantastic atmosphere complimented by the great sounds and visuals.At some points i admit it can be predicatble such as the obvious body on the ground that you know wil come alive and the elevators that break down and you just know your gona have to defend yourself. However im gonna lay that down to just having alot of previous experience so things like that may seem obvious to me and probaly others too.Basic stand point, if you enjoy a horror with good atmosphere, combat, a few jump scares and plenty of blood and gore than this game if for you!!!

												This game is effectively the same as the first gameplay-wise with a few tweaks. There are a some new weapons and the game rewards those who use stasis in combat, i.e. me. There are also new enemies. Some which are more challenging to deal with as the can projectile vomit acid and liquid nitrogen over 100 meters with stunning accuracy.Design-wise, this game is much more linear. You will feel more like you are stumbling through a bunch of set pieces instead of navigating your way through a ship to achieve a task.One aspect you may find jarring is that Issac now has a voice. It's not that bad in the long run. Although the cutscenes and dialog remain unskippable.All-in-all a good experience. You may find some answers behind the marker and necromorphs, but there is still plenty of mystery left.			",272,28,5,25,13,3,28

												I love this game with one major complaint -It comes with the DLC pre-loaded.Why is this a complaint? Well, from the VERY BEGINNING of the game, you have access to many different weapons (and I think even armor suits) that you normally would not. Not to mention, it's all completely free.Now, this is just me, but personally, I do not like having all this extra crap available to me because it really hurts the whole ""resource management"" aspect of the game. And the survival horror aspect in general. The game is simply easier with the ability to get all of these different guns for free.At least at one point, there was a means (albeit convoluted) of removing the DLC from the game, but it meant reverting to a previous version of the game with less updates/patches. I think that's just stupid. You should be able to disable the DLC prior to starting a new campaign game.But despite that, this game still gets a ""thumbs up"" because it's just that good.

												Dead Space 2 is a great horror game and a brilliant sequel to the another great horror game.Set, I believe, three years after the events of the first game, Isaac Clarke wakes up in a psych ward in a hospital in a space station, just as the infection that wreaked havoc on the Ishimura (space ship) from the first game breaks out on this space station. Clarke makes his escape while having hallucinations but is also guided by a stranger. This is where the story really kicks off. Because I'm going to avoid giving away any spoilers, I'm just going to say that the person you hallucinate throughout the game is Nicole, Isaac's former love interest from the first game.The brilliance of the horror elements in this game is that it isn't a jump scare type of game. It's genuinely terrifying because of the extent of damage done to this space station due to a breakout in the disease that transforms the people into these abominations of creatures. The most memorable part is, arguably, when you're in a nursery and you see a woman, still alive, trying to cradle her baby, who has visibly transformed. Well, the baby has a yellow, soft belly and if you've played the first game, you'll remember that the yellow areas are weak points prone to explode. You can probably guess what happens to the woman.The soundtrack is nice but the game really shines when there isn't any music at all. Just the vast void of sound is so profound and the slightest creak will catch you off guard. The sound mixing in this game is done expertly. The graphics are stellar. I mean, I can tell it came out in 2011, but the lighting is so great and the textures on the walls and characters are generally fantastic. All around splendid job on graphics. The level design is done well enough where each chapter has a varied design. I especially loved the zero gravity flying around in space. The vastness of it, and being able to see Saturn in the distance (I'm pretty sure it's Saturn) is just so unique.Anyway, I feel like I've said enough. Really, fantastic game. Highly recommend.9.3/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

Not to mention the fantastic atmosphere complimented by the great sounds and visuals.At some points i admit it can be predicatble such as the obvious body on the ground that you know wil come alive and the elevators that break down and you just know your gona have to defend yourself. However im gonna lay that down to just having alot of previous experience so things like that may seem obvious to me and probaly others too.Basic stand point, if you enjoy a horror with good atmosphere, combat, a few jump scares and plenty of blood and gore than this game if for you!!!

												This game is effectively the same as the first gameplay-wise with a few tweaks. There are a some new weapons and the game rewards those who use stasis in combat, i.e. me. There are also new enemies. Some which are more challenging to deal with as the can projectile vomit acid and liquid nitrogen over 100 meters with stunning accuracy.Design-wise, this game is much more linear. You will feel more like you are stumbling through a bunch of set pieces instead of navigating your way through a ship to achieve a task.One aspect you may find jarring is that Issac now has a voice. It's not that bad in the long run. Although the cutscenes and dialog remain unskippable.All-in-all a good experience. You may find some answers behind the marker and necromorphs, but there is still plenty of mystery left.			",272,28,5,25,13,3,28

												This was my first AAA purchase, i bought it years ago on the 360, back when i was a console peasant. This was, is, and always will be a favourite of mine, not too puzzling, dificulty scales well, still quite spooky, and smoth combat that is rarely interupted, but makes great use of hitboxes. Ragdoll physics and gib physics cobine almost seamlessly, along with excellent responsiveness to one's intended target. AKA you shoot leg, leg gets cut off where you shot it and ragdolls instantly. This game may also have inspired the, dare i mention it, death fetish tomb raider, better known as tomb raider 2013 however. Language, though not censored, is nowhere near oppressive and is taken in great moderation without sparing the story of emotion. gore, well, i mean if you're playing a zombie horror game but not wanting to see any gore you must be doing it wrong. on the topic of zombie horror, however, DS2 manages to capture the classic feeling of fear that comes with the collapse of society due to an outbreak, but also manages to make the zombies themselves terrifying and wastes no time plunging the player into a high-octane hook showcasing some of the creatures while instilling the initial fear into the player. Tutorial is simple and unobtrusive, albeit drawn out just a bit long (if you consider the first store the end of the tutorial) but does it's job better than most, if not all AAA titles these days, teaching the player how to use the more tactical and less practical skills to ensure that they can learn how to combine them with gunplay and running for your life for an effective strategy later in the game.overall, 8.75/10PC port needs a little bit of bug fixing after all these years and the multiplayer felt like an ever so slightly poorly executed version of L4D2, at least on the 360.-EDIT-the minimum system requirements are way above what you will need to play, i managed a solid 40 FPS average on a 1.7 ghz processor, far less than their suggested 2.8			",198,5,2,6,5,0,4

												Were you bored of the first game? Felt it didn't flow? Isaac felt a bit robotic and unbelievable? Yeah that's what I thought Dead Space 2 was going to be like.BUT NO.Take the game and put in into a BLENDER OF AWESOME and out comes Dead Space 2! The weapons are better, Isaac can actually talk like a human, the enemies are diverse and their jump scares are more tactful and less repetitive. The zero gravity ability is made 10x better with the ability to manuvoure around in a 3 dimensional plane rather than just jumping from surface to surface...AND THE APPLICATIONS ARE AMAZING. YOU FEEL LIKE IRON MAN!!!!I just couldn't get enough of this game and I was glued to the screen the entire time. Totally blows Dead Space 1 out of the water and some levels felt like Bioshock while others felt like the Scarecrow levels from Batman. Oh my god what will Dead Space 3 bring? WORTH PLAYING!!

Dead Space is a must get for horror gamer's or our century. And I Hope many of you get them, and enjoy them as much as I do.P.S Dead Space 2 was nice too us on P.C, and gave us all the DLC suits, and weapons for free, so yea.

												Dead Space 2 is set three years after the events of the first Dead Space game. The game follows protagonist Isaac Clarke's fight against a new Necromorph outbreak on the Sprawl, a space station above Saturn's largest moon, Titan.The game incorporates many aspects of the original Dead Space game that made it such a classic, as a result some may consider the game Dead Space 1.5 rather than Dead Space 2. However, this is not a bad thing. The original game was great and as such, Dead Space 2 fills the large shoes of its predecessor whole and completely. As for the plot, I found it engaging which allowed me to connect with Isaac Clarke and his perilous quest. The gameplay was a smooth and enjoyable experience. In addition, Dead Space 2 was successful in creating a world that left you feeling alone and just one step behind the atrocities of the Necromorph outbreak. The subtle rumblings of a necromorph above you or the eerier silence when entering a new room provided just enough tension to make you jump out your seat when a necromorph jumps out at you.If you thoroughly enjoyed the first Dead Space, Dead Space 2 will not disappoint.

												Dead Space 2 is a great horror game and a brilliant sequel to the another great horror game.Set, I believe, three years after the events of the first game, Isaac Clarke wakes up in a psych ward in a hospital in a space station, just as the infection that wreaked havoc on the Ishimura (space ship) from the first game breaks out on this space station. Clarke makes his escape while having hallucinations but is also guided by a stranger. This is where the story really kicks off. Because I'm going to avoid giving away any spoilers, I'm just going to say that the person you hallucinate throughout the game is Nicole, Isaac's former love interest from the first game.The brilliance of the horror elements in this game is that it isn't a jump scare type of game. It's genuinely terrifying because of the extent of damage done to this space station due to a breakout in the disease that transforms the people into these abominations of creatures. The most memorable part is, arguably, when you're in a nursery and you see a woman, still alive, trying to cradle her baby, who has visibly transformed. Well, the baby has a yellow, soft belly and if you've played the first game, you'll remember that the yellow areas are weak points prone to explode. You can probably guess what happens to the woman.The soundtrack is nice but the game really shines when there isn't any music at all. Just the vast void of sound is so profound and the slightest creak will catch you off guard. The sound mixing in this game is done expertly. The graphics are stellar. I mean, I can tell it came out in 2011, but the lighting is so great and the textures on the walls and characters are generally fantastic. All around splendid job on graphics. The level design is done well enough where each chapter has a varied design. I especially loved the zero gravity flying around in space. The vastness of it, and being able to see Saturn in the distance (I'm pretty sure it's Saturn) is just so unique.Anyway, I feel like I've said enough. Really, fantastic game. Highly recommend.9.3/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												I love this game with one major complaint -It comes with the DLC pre-loaded.Why is this a complaint? Well, from the VERY BEGINNING of the game, you have access to many different weapons (and I think even armor suits) that you normally would not. Not to mention, it's all completely free.Now, this is just me, but personally, I do not like having all this extra crap available to me because it really hurts the whole ""resource management"" aspect of the game. And the survival horror aspect in general. The game is simply easier with the ability to get all of these different guns for free.At least at one point, there was a means (albeit convoluted) of removing the DLC from the game, but it meant reverting to a previous version of the game with less updates/patches. I think that's just stupid. You should be able to disable the DLC prior to starting a new campaign game.But despite that, this game still gets a ""thumbs up"" because it's just that good. A great sequel to the first.			",237,34,1,8,13,0,5

Very fun and worth it's asking price too.  Everything that slowed down the 1st game was fixed in this one.  Better controls, limited to no back tracking at all and better animations.  High production value and it shows.  I do believe that Dead Space 1 was the better experience, but Dead Space 2 was the better game.No more the silent protaganist as Isaac Clarke now speaks and while I was initially turned off by this it's actually not all that bad.  Additionally, now there's Multiplayer!  Played Left 4 Dead multiplayer?  Then you've play DSMP.  Game on!			",818,169,5,146,15,0,71

												Sometimes sequels fall short of expectations, but Dead Space 2 is definitely not the case. A noticeable improvement from the first game of the series, in terms of gameplay and storyline. It keeps the elements that make this game unique but simplifies other that werent that good, like the z jumping. I would definitely recommend this, specially if you havent played it on the consoles, because the port to PC was really well done, no problems to report.9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The epitome of Action packed Survival-Horror. The game is beautiful, and the controls are perfect and fluid. The story is compelling, and the atmosphere is thick. While it does loose its horror after a few playthroughs(You'll memorize where all enemies are very quickly) it is still fun too play through again and again.Zealot mode has a wya of re-implementing that horror, though. It's perfectly challenging. One of my favorite games!			",63,3,0,4,1,0,0

												""Make us whole again""Literally the best Dead Space in the series. They nailed the setting, atmosphere, voice acting, combat, and graphics (for a 2011 game). They give you a little refresher on what happened in the first game so you can jump right into this one if you wanted to. My only con for this game is the zero g. It was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥in Dead Space one but improoved upon it in this installment, it's still kinda clunky and hard to control but 10 times better than the first game. As for the horror part, its pretty scary even for a guy like me who isn't easily scared that much. I give this a solid 10/10 even though zero g sucks balls still. Probably going to be a favorite of mine for a long time.			",152,7,0,22,13,0,9

												Notice the glaring differences between the cover of this game and the prequel. The first game shows a severed arm drifting into the emptiness. It illustrates the dangerous and desolate nature of space. The second game takes a more 'gamey' approach showing the player in a manly helmet. This should give you a rough idea on how they differ. What follows is a continued comparative analysis because why the hell not?! One of the biggest issues with the first game was the oversupply of ammo. It was nothing but a hindrance to setting that despondent mood that I was yearning for. This game on Zealot (hardest difficulty available on first run through) does a better job, usually forcing you to micromanage and conserve your ammo by using other methods of necromorph destruction. The lighting is top notch and the sound is great, especially in zero gravity! One would think these improvements would bump them scary vibes up to 11! Well have they? You've left behind the oppressive, flesh smeared corridors of the first game and been dropped into a more open, relatable environment. If you're wondering if the spritely decor of this game diminishes the levels of suspense driven apprehension you'd be right. Ooo did a toy just ominously roll into view in the next room? Sorry I was too busy investigating this rainbow for missing colours. Rarely did I have a lapse in composure. Only the black as pitch office/cafeteria and a slice off Chapter 10 offered enough atmosphere for me to take a vigilant approach. Furthermore the jumpscares aren't as plentiful as the first game. Less jump scares means better quality scares you say? Nah the lack of originality renders most of them as predictable as the discussion topics of a feminazi night out. Enough lollygagging about atmoscares!.. or jumpsphere! They introduced some new enemies in this game. From children swarming you in groups like you're the surrogate mother of mankind to enemies looking like a rejected pokemon, stampeding at you head first trying to sell the notion that living on one TM is effective. They sold it alright. While I admire Headbutt in the pokemon world it's the utmost annoyance in this game. Sitting in a corner waiting for the next one to charge is boring. Being aggressive can easily lead to your death as they'll usually one shot you on Zealot. Maybe I'm just bad but ♥♥♥♥ those things! If they managed not to give you an one way express pass to a funeral home, it's likely you banged them up with your super mega awesome range of weapons of which were improved from the first game. 5 or 6 weapons that I found were satisfyingly impactful as opposed to the mere 3 in the first game. Oh and kinesis impalement exists. What's not to love there?Love doesn't end there though. Once you finish the game you can play through it again in NG+ or restart naked with only 3 saves at your disposal. It's a nifty feature and more games should have it. Now the love ends. Many a time I leaped into vents like a highly trained rat but crawled through them like a centipede with my legs tied together. These vents are used to transition between some levels but to me it smells of a cop out by the level designers. Oh and who do I have to line gun in the face for including disappearing corpses? I earned that loot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it.In Dead Space the desolate ship was a vehicle used to portray the eminence of atmosphere while the sequel threw you into a more approachable world. Ergo as a fear inducing chamber in pixel form it pales in comparison to the first but simply as a video game it's a step up from its predecessor and one of the most solid ones out there.

												I bought the PS3 edition a year or two before purchasing the PC ported game. After worrying for hours how it would play, smoothly or choppy, on my ASuS laptop...The game worked beautifully and dare I say even faster on here. The game has a lovely story as always, and after quitting the PS3 edition because of hatred to the controller gameplay, I am happy to say I will perservere and finally beat this god damn game. Here's the pros and cons:PROS:    - Interesting Story           Isaac Clarke has been admitted to a psychiactrics ward where he must escape. But beyond there, it's a terrifying        nightmare that pushes your tolerance to the ultimate limits.   - Great Graphics          Even for the worst computers, the graphics really stand out and work well for the game. The characters, being the most important in terms of detail, are stunning to say the least.   - Weapons          Every survival game needs weapons. Well, except for Outlast™ and a few select others. Anywho, the weapons really stand out and are unique. They a small part consists of makeshift weapons, such as a surgical lazer and fire extinquisher. the rest are things like pulse rifles and spear guns, which are really cool as well.   - Save, Shop, and Store Stations          This game would be horrifically hard without the features you find repeating in the areas of your journey. These are of course the save station, the item shop, the bench, and the numerous stasis chargers you find. The save station is pretty self explanitory, being where you can save your game. The item shop is where you can store items, buy items, and sell items. It's really needed for a game of this stature. The bench is useful too, giving you a place to upgrade armor and weapons, kinda like the enchanting table from Minecraft™.CONS:   - Glitches             Every game has glitches, it's unavoidable. Even then, this goes in the list. I haven't run into many, but a few have been tht I found enemies stuck in walls and scenery, and falling through elevators happened on one rare occasion. Even then, it doesn't break immersion and this isn't that bad. It's actually kinda.. funny.   - Multiplayer             I know whatcha thinking; ""Dood. How cud multiplayar b bad!?"". Well, it's not the basic idea, the gameplay, or the entire thing itself. It's the lack of people. If you want to buy this game, don't do it for the sake of multiplayer. It's not going to work if you randomly match, and for that you should get a console release. But if you REALLY wanna play multiplayer, get a large group of friends (4-8) and then you're set.   I'll update this as I continue playing. Right now, the rating it a 8/10. ",128,8,1,11,7,1,3

												This game is really fun! You wake up in a mental hospital, because you keep having visions of hot babes, and they mess up your concentration. Suddenly the hospital is under attack by aliens, who have been hunting you for 11 years after you gambled with them and lost, but the fee you had to pay was too much so you made a break for it. Well, they found you after 11 years. You pick up a gun, which looks badass, and you have no idea how to use but it looks badass as I said, so you keep it, and don this EPIC space suit that attracts all the female aliens, but you're too good for them so you have to put them in stasis and break their limbs off. How complicated the life of a space plumber is with the relationships and the gambling and the guns!You escape to a huge spaceship, and take shelter there. You meet some more aliens, and believe me this game doesn't get repetitive, since it's not like you shoot aliens throught the game or anything, I mean EA are smarter than that. You meet a woman, with one eye, who claims she can cure you from your hot babe visions. Suddenly, Isaac Clarke (that's you) goes from being a space plumber who always shows his crack while fixing the portal potties to a ladies man and alien hunter (just like how Abraham Lincoln became a Vampire Hunter). The jump scares don't get repetitive and this game is SUPER scary that you will probably get a heart attack while playing it. I highly recommend this game to people who love the ladies and shooting aliens. I DON'T recommend this to people who enjoy shooting aliens over and over again, because that is NOT what you do in this game.			",123,6,3,15,5,0,8

												A huge improvement from its predeccessor, Dead Space 2 proves to be an amazing horror game with tons of jumpscares which leaves the player cautious when walking around the eerie spaceship. The gameplay is really good and the controls are easy to use (Xbox 360 controller). The music that they add during gameplay really adds up to the creepy atmosphere, and it makes it feel like as though necromorphs could jump out at you at anytime. This game is a definite must to pick up for any horror game fans out there!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Dead Space series is one that I have an ambivalent relationship with. On one hand, it is a made that is solid both in its mechanics and presentation. On the other, there is not much that is original or substantial about the experience. While presenting itself as a survival-horror experience, a feeling of helplessness and danger is all but removed by the games lack of dynamism. Enemies try very hard to kill you at every turn with little reprieve, and while the survival aspect is bolstered by the scarcity of ammunition and supplies, the journey becomes frustrating and stressful much more than it does scary as there is very little reward presented when overcoming challenges.The graphics are gorgeous and characters are well acted and animated, especially Elly, whose who owes her voice and appearance to Sonita Henry of Star Trek fame. But even these nice touches do little to redeem the derivative, vapid story and tedious gameplay.			",301,44,6,22,13,4,15

												Isaac hunts againThe controls for the PC version of DS1 were awful. The good news is that these have been improved in DEAD SPACE 2 and are no longer the issue they were in the original. (There are still some problems with camera angles when boxed into a corner but these are an irritation rather than a deal breaker.) DS2 also handles zero gravity in a far more intuitive, and enjoyable way, with none of the crazy hopping from one surface to another as in the first game. Now you can move freely, as you would expect. Also improved in DS2 is Isaac’s level of interaction. Now he speaks! This actually improves the experience more than might be expected, as it gives a greater sense that you’re involved in an unfolding story. The graphics are above average quality though not outstanding. The gameplay is improved by the introduction of more varied environments (although this is still very much a corridor shooter), and there are still plenty of tense moments when battling with enemies, some of which will be familiar if you played DS1, and some of which are new. When compared with the original DS2 is basically more of the same but with a number of welcome improvements and enhcncements. On a final note: I found it a little easier than the first, but that might be because of the improved controls and my familiarity with the gameplay second time around. Anyhoo, there’s still plenty of nerve-jangling fun to be had. Recommended, especially if you liked the original.4/5			",77,5,0,6,1,0,3

												Great sequal in one of the best contemporary survival horror series. Dead Space 2 has improved graphics, slight but noticeable gameplay improvements that make combat that little bit more fun--yet that little bit less scary to beat but it's a trade-off that still works. The game's environments, sounds, rooms with flickering emergency power, etc., all as scary as the original. The enemies are very similar to those in the original but that is fine because it makes sense with the storyline and Dead Space has some of the most unique enemies in any game of its kind. AI is still great, unpredictable, and therefore quite scary.All in all, this game improves on a lot of what the original already did well. For fans of survival horror, if Dead Space is a must-have, Dead Space 2 is right along there beside it! 9/10.			",114,10,19,26,9,0,20

												Overall a good game which addresses some of DS1's control and movement issues. However it is less frightening and spooky that DS1 mainly in the replacement computer voice - it sounds like you are in a lift tootling to the childrens department instead of a no-hope you-against-the-world and i'm-not-helping-you computer voice in DS1.Zero-G is also dumbed down from DS1 with it's i-can't-figure-which-way-up-i-am-recovery-button. Hello? in zero-g which way IS up?? Did gamers get confused and stop thinking in 3D?? Anyway this feels a lot more console based than PC based, but hey at least now I don't have to play WASD...Graphics have had a slight overhaul as wel as some new and very quick monsters...It also advances the main story line from the Ishimura...Overall a good game.

												!!!!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!!!!This is a good game in its self with the claustrophobia feel to it, and the atmosphere changing just by opening a door. But the down side to this is that it seems pretty liniar. Its story ties in fairly good to the first(and this done so even more when you fisit the Ishumrua). Isaccs marker broken mind makes his dillusions seem real at times, even with that orange glow to it. Stross was important in the fact he was a plot device driving the story untill Isacc (the ultra bad *ss of the universe) became a god to destroy the marker. And the marker seemed like another plot device as it was in the first; its all about the markers, and no one seems to relize the danger of these things. all in all 7/10 with a fair plot and acctualy giving Isaac a personality and a face, as for the plot devices these can be changed to other objectives. As in (and this is a joke) having to take a leak after mutilating a baby and about half the sprwal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Many horror games are able to deliver shocks during play, but none does it as well as Dead Space 2. Isaac's inner struggle in the tense setting of ""Sprawl"" provides an unforgettable atomsphere, making Dead Space 2 one of the most terrifying and unmissable horror games this generation and the benchmark for others to follow. 7/10			",102,24,0,13,7,2,12

												An awesome game to play. If you look for good horror and action, this is the game for you. The game will always make you want to be on your guard. There is barely any time for you to chill. This is a heart stopping game with lots of gore and twists. The story line is good and if you are new to the DS series, the game isn't that hard to learn. As long as you have good aim, you can pretty much get right into this game. 10/10 recommend.			",47,13,0,7,5,0,1

												I have spent 8 hours in this game, and it is a great survival shooter, but unlike the first one this has very little scary moments (in my oppinion). To make up for this however it includes like the others a very dark atmosphere to help you realize for the first 6-7 chapters you are alone with no one else. The multiplayer is fun with very minimal connectivity issues which is nice. Just as violent as the first one... obviously. Not very many stores or benches to work off of for a good portion of the game. stupid hospital from the first game T_T, sadly no doctor to attempt the murder of Issac. Yeah this basically covers it.			",81,9,4,14,4,1,5

												If the first Dead Space redefined the survival-horror genre, then it's sequal redefines the redefinition.  Dead Space 2 takes all the aspects that made it's older brother a success (chilling story, excellent gun-play and a stunning atmosphere) and doubles them in quality, while the brand-new and well-balanced multiplayer adds well-deserved replay value in what could have been game of the year.  Even if you're not into the horror genre, you need to check this game out; you won't regret it; you can't regret it!			",865,261,38,108,86,11,169

			In space, no one can hear you slowly lose your mind while being possessed by your dead girlfriend and undead things trying to kill you. ***** Dead Space 2 is copyright Visceral Games, 2011.		

This game is a fantastic followup to the original Dead Space.  While many will call the original Dead Space little more than ""Resident Evil 4 in space"" (and I'm inclined to agree with them), Dead Space 2 manages to branch out into psychological horror and keep the tension high.  Yeah, there are still jump scares, but the atmosphere overall has been cranked up to 11 and the shootouts are even more frenzied.I don't know how they did it, but they managed to make it work both on the action and the horror front.

												After the frankly pretty poor port of Dead Space with its floaty, imprecise controls and sub par visual presentation, I was hoping that the port of Dead Space 2 would be handled better. And boy it sure was! The controls are precise with Issac moving smoothly and aiming being alot more responsive. Also the visual presentation is fantastic! With the eeire atmosphere of the Sprawl being conveyed brilliantly in conjunction with the stellar audio presentation to make the Sprawl a consistantly engaging setting. There are issues with the game certainly, such as the over-reliance on cheap jump scares rather than building its horror to truely terrify the player. Also the story could have been so much more with Issac barely given a personality other than ""Bland everyman"" and the human antagonist is barely seen only having 2-3 scenes in the whole game before the final encounter. However! Look past these issues and you'll find a really fun third person shooter with a great atmosphere to boot!			",243,42,1,11,4,1,8

												Not only is this one of the best games I have played, it has one of the best stories to go along with it, with books and short films (of which I have read and seen all), it really stands apart from the crowd because of this.The Game-play is unprecedented for its time and is easily one of the most gripping and intuitive play-styles that have ultimately made me love this series, and with Dead space 2 it builds onto the creepy atmospheres and scary environments.However with the above being amazing it wouldn’t actually be as half good as it is without the music score behind it. It keeps you one edge and sets the mood in the game so perfectly I have freaked out over absolutely nothing when the violins strung a little to hard and made me jump.Personally, I would recommend a controller for this.Game-play 9/10Music score 10/10Story 9.5/10OVERALL 9.5/10 - A game that will be worth your full attention.

												Absolutely awesome game. Some claim the horror elements are completely replaced by action, but that is not true. While the third game clearly goes down the action route, this game finds a perfect balance between action, horror, and story. Isaac finally talks! He's now reacting to things, talking to people, connecting to people, and responding to his hallucinations. It gives the game's narrative a much stronger and believable feel this time around. The gameplay mechanics are largely the same, with some new tweaks and additions here and there. Overall a more refined, intense, and emotional journey than the first.			",154,25,0,16,6,0,7

												I had read other reviews suggesting that you needed to play the first dead space before the second. After completing the first game and being slightly annoyed with some of the game mechanics, I can say I would have cheerfully skipped the first and went into the second without having missed much. You can also check out what you missed from the first one if you go straight into the second. The concepts are the same but this one is much more well polished and the game mechanics are smoother. I am just on chapter two of this one and already i'm more impressed with this and find it much creepier than the first. The first one I made myself finish this looks like one that I may actually enjoy playing all the way through. This is a very graphic game tho and very gory.			",17,0,0,0,2,0,0

Pros+ Atmosphere+ Game play is excellent. Very satisfying+ Had to be very resourceful and patient. (At least on the Zealot difficulty)+ Good story and voice acting+ Plasma Cutter is BaeCons- The DLC. Let me explain... The Steam version includes all the DLC for the game which is cool but its all overpowered weapons and suits for single player that are literally free from shops in the game from the very start. Personally I didn't use them for the fact it would just ruin the game for me. It was annoying having to navigate through all the DLC items cluttering up the shops through out the game.- CrawlersOverall a great game and one of the best survival horror games I've played. A massive improvement in almost every way over its predecessor (Which was still a really good game). Final Score - ★★★★☆			",176,32,0,41,6,0,9

												A well-done immersive survival horror game.Be amazed at how quickly time flies with this game. On a three-day weekend, I almost played it all the way through.It's almost a prerequisite to play Dead Space (1) first because many of the tactics that are used in 1 are needed in 2.  You will need to capitalize on some of those same methods.For example, the distribution of ammo from dead enemies is based mainly on the weapons that you have. It's not clear that having many weapons is actually detrimental to your gaming experience. Although the spawning of ammo from dead enemies is not as strict as it was in Dead Space 1, it still applies to a certain degree here.  Try to have a small set of weapons of 3.  Plasma Cutter ( the ""pistol"" of the game) is a requirement to keep for it's low cost of buying ammo and upgrading.  FYI, this is one of the reasons why Dead Space 3 had changed to ""Universal Ammo"" that can be used for any weapon. Other than keeping this in mind, you should be fine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Horror games nowerdays are very week. Lacking actual fear, aticipation and pure thrills all in one package. Dead Space 2 however will give you all that and more!Gameplay: The gameplay is a solid 3rd person shooter. You have to react fast and learn skills quicly to surive on hard settings. New enemies mean new ways to kill.Story: An intresting a deep storyline that contiues were the last game left of. Whilst not as deep or mystic still delivers a solid storyline.Graphics: Above par and excellently atmospheric feel, with lighting and blood and gore that a epic Horror game should have. Plus an excellent optmised engine. The game used only 30% of my CPU and only one core, amazing to say the graphics are as amazing as they are.So overall, this along with the original Dead Space are instant classics, both for hall of fame and the pioneer of Horror games.I give it a 9.8/10Pro's:- Explores the old ship, very nostagic- Just an Epic gameCon's:- Could use better use of Audio			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dead Space 2 lets you take control of Isaac Clarke again as he tries to survive a space colony on Saturn's biggest moon, Titan. The games brings a lot more to the table this time. A few new weapons, such as a giant spike gun that impales and  electrocutes enemies. Game mechanics have been tuned up. The game runs a lot more smoothly and melee is much more effective. The suit system returns too, but this time each suit has it's own little bonus, like giving you a discount at the store. They even redid the Zero Gravity parts so you have full control over your character. A few new enemies have been added, including an enemy that uses cover then tries to sneak behind you.Overall the game feels like a sequel instead of just a modded add on or DLC. Just make sure as you near the end of the game you are fully upgraded. It has quite the difficulty spike near the end.			",59,12,0,12,2,1,2

												The Dead Space series is one that I have an ambivalent relationship with. On one hand, it is a made that is solid both in its mechanics and presentation. On the other, there is not much that is original or substantial about the experience. While presenting itself as a survival-horror experience, a feeling of helplessness and danger is all but removed by the games lack of dynamism. Enemies try very hard to kill you at every turn with little reprieve, and while the survival aspect is bolstered by the scarcity of ammunition and supplies, the journey becomes frustrating and stressful much more than it does scary as there is very little reward presented when overcoming challenges.The graphics are gorgeous and characters are well acted and animated, especially Elly, whose who owes her voice and appearance to Sonita Henry of Star Trek fame. But even these nice touches do little to redeem the derivative, vapid story and tedious gameplay.			",301,44,6,22,13,4,15

												really good game... The follow up to Dead Space does everything better. It is darker and has a more gritty vibe to it.Gameplay is solid and at times it will make you sweat...If you didn't play the first part then you should before giving this game a go.The story just continues after the first Dead Space,, There is no quite and/or slow beginning, after a brief intro,where you are sitting and talking about past experiences (Dead Space 1) with your shrink things start to go crazy from the beginning.. Stop thinking, start running for your life in the hell called Dead Space 2.You will not get a minute to get a breath because in this part of the Dead Space all hell breaks loose straight away..Graphics are a little better, sound in my opinion the same (good) and the gameplay is awesome..Highly essential videogame series... I'd rate this about a 8,7 out of 10. Get this and start playing...			",1191,341,65,193,114,13,186

												I have spent 8 hours in this game, and it is a great survival shooter, but unlike the first one this has very little scary moments (in my oppinion). To make up for this however it includes like the others a very dark atmosphere to help you realize for the first 6-7 chapters you are alone with no one else. The multiplayer is fun with very minimal connectivity issues which is nice. Just as violent as the first one... obviously. Not very many stores or benches to work off of for a good portion of the game. stupid hospital from the first game T_T, sadly no doctor to attempt the murder of Issac.

Pros+ Atmosphere+ Game play is excellent. Very satisfying+ Had to be very resourceful and patient. (At least on the Zealot difficulty)+ Good story and voice acting+ Plasma Cutter is BaeCons- The DLC. Let me explain... The Steam version includes all the DLC for the game which is cool but its all overpowered weapons and suits for single player that are literally free from shops in the game from the very start. Personally I didn't use them for the fact it would just ruin the game for me. It was annoying having to navigate through all the DLC items cluttering up the shops through out the game.- CrawlersOverall a great game and one of the best survival horror games I've played. A massive improvement in almost every way over its predecessor (Which was still a really good game). Final Score - ★★★★☆			",176,32,0,41,6,0,9

Game felt quite fast pased at times but i like it like that. Though this game is a horror/thriller it really didnt scare me at all but was good fun to play. So much that I ended up deciding to make a let's play on this game. I would recommend this game to anyone who is into the fps/rpg/horror genre.			",64,41,1,11,15,2,8

												Dead Space 2 is one helluva sequel. It is indeed similar to the first game obviously, but several new elements have been added to game such as hacking. After the disaster on the USG Ishimura, DS2 now brings you to a bunch bigger place, Titan Station aka the Sprawl a huge metropolis orbiting Saturn.  The necromorphs are back and Issac Clarke is on the run from Unitology and EarthGov. Dead space 2 is also loaded with more weapons and more RIG suits to suit your preference.  However, the PC version includes all DLC except for Severed but many of the DLC suits are available free in the store. So it loses the challenge. There is also a multiplayer mode in the game which I do not recommand buying the game if you want online. This is for the story. Oh, and Issac Clarke has a voice actor now. Get this game, its also much more optimized on the PC. So no mouse aiming issues like in Dead Space 1			",103,12,3,5,9,1,19

												First, I have a deep, abiding love for System Shock 2.  It pains me to say, then, that one could legitimately call this game ""System Shock 4,"" since EA weaseled the SS rights away from Irrational, forcing Irrational to make BioShock, which released just before Dead Space, forcing EA to rename their game and throw away their legal ownership of the System Shock franchise to avoid it becoming commonly known the shameful thing they'd done.Dead Space (1 or 2) lost the RPG elements that made SS2 so great, and added lots of ""BOO!"" moments, so it's more like Doom 3 clone than a System Shock 2 sequel.  So ""EFF YOU"" SS2 fans!  I DO like the dismemberment thing, though...Bitterness aside, Dead Space 2 looks cool, runs smoother than DS1, is more fun to play than DS1, doesn't try to startle you as much as DS1 (a lame way to be scary, IMO), pays way more homage to the SS2 style than DS1 (a huge plus for me), and was totally worth the $10 I paid for it.   You should pay $10 for DS2, too.			",173,38,1,4,12,1,4

												Dead Space 2. This game is fantastic. It has a great narrative and action that will keep you coming back for more. The controls can be edited as you see fit (unlike the first one). The graphics are nicely done and the action sequences are engaging. The story is solid with several references to the first game and the two animated movies  as well. I have now played through this game three times and it was consistently fun each time. This game has much to offer in the Third Person Perspective genre. If you are interested in a survival horror game or simply enjoyed the first Dead Space. Get it  whenever you can.

												it's an alright game for a brainless corridor shooter. Not really a horrifying or scary game but constant gorefest unlike anything i've ever seen in a video game. Atmosphere was Interesting enough to keep me playing till the end. Lots of generic mutated monsters to kill and lots of stomping around gets boring quickly. Nice to have many weapon choices and optimizations- not that it matters but still nice. Animations and reactions int the game are fantastic, however camera controls and gameplay feels just wrong for pc gaming. especially FOV. Well, at least ds2 is playable unlike ds1 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.In the end, ds2 has its own fine moments. I'd recommend this to everyone with the guts to handle all the gore. and much more gore.

												I really liked the first Dead Space game and for me, Dead Space 2 is able to keep up the pace. I know alot of people think that the best game is still the first one but for me I can't really say, I liked both of them. So Dead Space 2 continues the story about Isaac Clark on a spacestation on one of Saturn moons and there's alot of plot and lore going on here. Basicly it's the same game as the first Dead Space with a few tweaks and additions along with improved graphical fidelety. One thing I felt about this one is that the game is more linear considering it doesn't give you any map as in the previous game but overall I still think it's a great game and if you liked the first game you'll probably also like Dead Space 2.

												Wow, amazing game. Truely amazing. The story takes place 3 years after the disaster aboard the Ishimora, and Isaac gets a little more help this time around. Dead Space 2's gameplay is quite unique! No more aim for the head for insta-kills, if youve played the previous Dead Space, you will feel right at home because melee, stompin, and stasis are all back. Theres not much to do outside of the single player, but the single player alone will last about 12 hours on a single playthrough, and if your like me, you will want to replay on Zealot mode...and that says alot. Im not one to replay single player games, but Dead Space is so different from other shooters its hard not to suit back up and blast your way through the Sprawl again. Multiplayer is Dead Space 2's biggest fault. There is only one game mode, 4v4 team objective. Survivors have to traverse the maps and accomplish objectives while the necromorphs defend them. Noobs don't get any perks, while vets have the advantage.			",225,24,8,30,11,1,26

												While certainly not Survival-HORROR, this game can put one on edge a little, and occasionally a jump scare will get you. Even if the game doesn't scare you, the story is entertaining and the combat very fast-paced and challenging for a third person shooter. Have yet to beat the game, so this review will be updated whenI do, but so far I've had a fun, challenging ride. Note: I am playing on the second highest difficulty and only using the starting pistol, so maybe the game is actually a lot easier, but if you avoid using other items and just upgrade the pistol and armor, the game is much more interesting. Also for those complaining about the DLC items, or new players to the game, do not buy the items in the store that cost $0. They are overpowered for the game and make the beginning sections really boring. Once you get to the point that you find at least one or two armor upgrades, then I'd say the free armor is fair game because it is basically the same thing.			",195,30,1,23,15,1,25

												A rather violent game in the horror genre.This is one of the greatset horror games in the 3A titles. It is atmospheric, bloody, and intense. If you are looking for a horror game, this game certainly nails the job. But Don't step away from this game just because that it is meant to scare you. This game got plenty of actions and a not-bad story. There is also a variety of weapons you can choose and upgrade. The gun-play is abosolutely amazing. Every shots is satisfying (I recommend the javelin gun).  To me, the only problem I have with this game is that the zero gravity section often makes me dizzy. ",176,42,3,16,10,2,3

												Enjoyable game, not as creepy as the first one, but it does have a more varied set of indoor locations than the first. I tell you this actually...i'm glad that Isaac Clarke (the protagonist of the game) was given a voice this time, cos he was mute in the first one. It's weird because they make the character mute usually so it will feel more immersive for the player, except it has the opposite effect on me, for example when the npc's talk to your character and he just blanks them it's annoying! like in half life 2 they actually have Alyx say "" the quiet type huh"" after Gordon doesn't respond. There are a few new monsters in this that weren't in the first like these raptoresque ones that hide behind crates and then charge at you. They only appear in rooms with big crates in them, so that's a bit formulaic, i mean it detracts from scariness if you know what the monster will be when you enter a room just by the way it's set out. Oh also that motherf*cking unkillable one that regenerates is back but only appears at the end so it's not too bad. I hate that one, it's cheap having an unkillable enemy, it's not scary but frustrating, stop it!.I preferred the ending to the first game more than this when you go down to the planet on that one, but without spoiling it i did like how the very ending of this one has a nice well not twist but like... play on how the first one ended, made me smile anyway.

												Dead space 2 has literally improved on everything in regaards to the previous game. It carries on 3 years from the end of the last game where isaac is a little more worse for wear but that aside he still kicks some necromorph♥♥♥♥♥ This game is the best horror game I have ever played and i must say that eventually you will emulate the fear Isaac feels, you will double checking corners, double tapping dead bodies and try hopelessly to conserve ammo. I am not a jumpy person but i have jumped many a time at this game due to the atmosphere it leaves off. (Also helps i play it with headset on in dark room by myself)NOTEWORTHY MENTION: If you think you got ex girlfriend baggage play this game, you've got NOTHING on Isaac.


He should of went to specsavers Haha

												One of these rare cases where a sequel improves on amost every apect of the original without losing its core. Granted, Dead Space 2 makes you feel less vulnerable and the atmosphere of the original can't really be topped that easily, but the combat, characterization, story progression, character relatinships, enemy designs and attacks, mechanics, visuals and music, they're all absolutely fantastic in this second part. Dead Space 2 is bigger, better in several aspects, it's challenging enough without being cheap on Zealot and Hardcore and it's a hell of a lot of fun. The best thing they did was finally give Isaac a face and voice and went inside his broken mind. The Nicole sequences were always fantastic, especially the latter ones, and the Ellie banter was just great. This is pretty much the refined Dead Space experience, with the exception of the opressive and lonelier nature of the first game's constant tone. I would highly recommend it.			",170,23,1,21,6,2,8

												There are some things about this game that i really enjoyed but there are a number of buts too.Like Dead Space the atmosphere was most excellent, BUT, the journey through the game was pretty-much one straight line. Oh, there were twists and turns throughout to give the illusion of a complicated Space Station etc but essentually you are rail-roaded all the wayThe combat is tough, the creatures are scary and vary enough to not get overly predictable BUT some levels are capped by stupid little Quick-Time events that break the flow and apart from the last 2 chapters fights are a simple matter of:Is this an 'encounter' room/corridor? (You can tell almost as soon as the regularily spaced doors open if this is one of 'those' rooms) Yes? Clear room No? Keep going wash rinse repeat  I did not sign on to the cr@ppy EA registration BUT still ended up having ALL the weapons and most of the Armour available to me at the very first purchase booth. There was no point hunting down schematics, it was obviously 'space Xmas' with free guns for all1st Person with the Oculus Rift would have made this game a heart-stopper BUT it is over-the-shoulder 3rd person which really weakened the experience for meI enjoyed the game. The story and back story was more than enough to keep me hooked in the whole way BUT it really just felt like playing with a 1st time  RPG Dungeon Master...

												Terrific. Love this game. I think it's the best of the series.In this episode everything is perfect: story, sound, graphic, controls, interface, weapon customization interface.The developers did a great job in my opinion. I have also the other two episodes, but the first is a mess with the controls and feels clunky when moving and looking around, while the last one has a different weapon & gear's customization menu that I don't like at all (the older one was faster to navigate and more intuitive).I played Deadspace 2 on Origin first and then I decided to buy it also on Steam. If you don't have none of the three and you want to buy one, then buy this episode, you won't regret it.(in italian)Splendido. Adoro questo gioco. Penso sia il migliore della serie.In questo episodio mi sembra tutto perfetto: storia, suoni, grafica, controlli, interfaccia, interfaccia di confgurazione delle armi.A mio parere gli sviluppatori hanno fatto un ottimo lavoro. Possiedo anche gli altri due episodi della serie, ma nel primo i controlli sono un casino e ci si sente goffi quando ci si muove e si guarda intorno, mentre nel terzo hanno cambiato l'interfaccia di configurazione delle armi e non mi piace per niente (la vecchia era più intuitiva e veloce da navigare).Ho giocato Deadspace 2 prima su Origin e poi l'ho preso anche su Steam.Se non avete nessun gioco della serie e volete prenderne uno, vi consiglio questo, non ve ne pentirete.

												Dead  Space 1 and 2Where to start. That they both are excellent survival horror games, that both are filled with immersion and that they both have great narrative and story. Those are just few thing Dead Space 1 and 2 have gotten right.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dead Space 1Dead Space 1 was very atmospheric and i was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for the first 4 hours of the game. + Lots of replay value+ Doesnt contain many jumpscares, it rather scares you with its tense and horrifying atmosphere+ Good story with good characters (nuff said)- Some annoying ""puzzles"" in the last few chapters-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dead Space 2Dead Space 2 had a great narrative and plot. Gameplay was only improved, cool new enemies were added and Isaac was back, better than ever.+ Gameplay was slightly more action packed but i had its scary moments aswell. A great balance between them to be correct+ DS2 is full of thrilling and intense moments. + The narrative was better this time and Isaac voiced made him instantly more likable.- I experienced some annoying bugs (weapons disapearing, infinite loading screen) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Something both games have in common+ Superior sound design (necromorphs sound so damn scary)+ Excellent survival gameplay+ Graphics looked fairly good even today when using ReShade graphical mod+ So much replay value-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------VerdictIf you like scary games, if you like survival horror, if you like atmosphere and if you want a good plot from a game.Go grab youself a Dead Space 1 and 2Dead Space 1 - ( 9.4 )Dead Space 2 - ( 9.7 )One word...

The game has a fantastic story line with protagonist Isaac witnessing traumatising events that effect his sanity and further makes the game more creepy .

												I have not played Dead Space 1 and I only watched the ""previously on dead space"" cinematic included in-game. It was enough to follow the story without any problems.The game is very good! The environment is great, sounds and suspence during the game, music and story all keep you wanting to finish it.I play with a keyboard and mouse and I found the keys to be at perfect locations, making sure you do not mistake critical functions in the game.In order to skip registration just click ""back"" when asked for e-mail/password and select ""do not show again"".Highly recommended.

												Honestly, this game is probably one of my favorites of all time. I played it when it first came out in 2011, and I'm playing it in 2015. It is a amazing horror action game with some elements of RPG.Honestly, alot of people say you ""need"" to play the first one, but I think the story in DS2 explains enough of what happened in the first. I would recommend 10/10.			",29,0,0,6,1,0,3

												I own Dead Space franchise on Origin, but everyone knows how it is with Origin and its game selection and community hub. Dead Space 2 is the overall the best sequel (already fantastic) game could wish for. Everything is bigger, better, darker, heavier, smoother. Story wise it's not a miracle and there are some plotholes, however the (bigger and darker) backstory around the Markers makes up for it. Controls are much more smoother actually enabling to play with mouse and keyboard, graphics is better (and thus looks still good even after four years since the game was released) and for me sadly Isaac got a voice :( However, as I found out by rebuying these games, Dead Space 1 and 2 are games that don't get very old and everyone can enjoy them even now, in 2015 and on. You can always start the game on harder difficulty with different weapons combo and completely ignoring the telekinesis, which is probably the most important game mechanic in this sequel of one helluva atmospheric game. Now gimme DS3 on Steam ^.^			",68,9,0,17,11,1,14

												Great horror experience. Even more gorey and scarey than the 1st game! They fine tuned much of what made Dead Space 1 great.

												They retained everything, that was good in the first game, and added another shovel of them in the second. I actually found Dead Space 2 more of a horror game then 1, apart from what the generality says, because of the games far more depressive enviroment and the more frequent jumpscares, or the intense cutscenes, which ads a lot to the whole feel of the game. The game is ballanced nicely, you always know what to do to survive in an event of a massive necromorph attack, you always gonna get the enough nodes, ammunition, money, and information to progress in game, and when you don't you always gonna have to use your head as just as many times as necessary for the game to not become frustrating or boring. (But what will be boring after a while is the grinding for nodes to upgrade even more your rig, and your weapons) I don't know that it is just me, or they did upgraded some kind of a way the engine of the game, it somehow runs much smoother, easier then Dead Space 1. There was a bug in the first episode; the ""w"" on my usb keyboard sometimes ""missed out"", but in this episode i did not experience even a little technical issue. Great job Visceral! I'll give it a 92/100 . If you liked Dead Space 1, you're gonna super-like Dead Space 2, so i'm very much recommending to go on, buy it, because it's worth the 10 Euros.			",107,20,5,11,3,0,3

												I love Dead Space 2. Why? Great gameplay, great story, great graphics, interesting settings, vicious creatures, the occasional scare and some really f*****d up moments that I really enjoy. The nice thing about Dead Space 2 on PC compared to the original on PC is that the port of DS2 is actually very good. It looks good, and it runs very smoothly. I use to own this game on PS3, and got it on Steam awhile back shortly after I got my new PC. The PC version is obviously better. The 30 hrs playtime I have is running through the game twice, and some time in the online multiplayer mode. The online death match mode is fun, too. Nothing amazing or deep, but a nice distraction. So if a game that is kind of a mixture Resident Evil 4 and Metroid (series) sounds like a good time... then I recommend Dead Space 2.			",470,56,26,78,32,3,77

												Dead Space 2 isn't really that scary. It's far, far too silly for that. Everyone is made from plasticine and jam, stomping on corpses will completely detach limbs (and yield treasure!), and you'll shoot room fulls of zombie children and watch as their arms and legs go flying everywhere. This game is so gratuitous, most of the time all you can do is laugh.Put simply, it's more the second half of Aliens than Alien. Dead Space 2 is mostly interested in having you shoot monsters and throwing buckets of gore at the screen. Which it does very well. There's a brief section two thirds of the way through where the game takes a breather to build some tension, but for the most part it's wall to wall necromorph blasting. And it's excellent.Just don't expect scares more complex than a corpse coming to life followed by a necromorph jumping out of a vent for the 437th time and a row.			",156,12,11,11,7,0,12

												I've had this game for years but somehow always managed to forget about it. However I'm glad I finally came around to play and finish it because it's a great game. Graphically it's still a good looker, even in 2015 (though the textures on the armor could be a little bit better /nitpicking ), the sound design is amazing and more than once the eeriness was kept by only the music. That said this one isn't as scary as the first one mainly because of two reasons. The first one being is that now Isaac knows what's happening around him (you also know that he pretty much kicks♥♥♥♥♥ and the second one is that in some parts of the game, instead of carefully constructed encounters, the enemy monsters just keep on coming, so it's more action oriented. Another negative aspect is that sometimes the game takes away the control from the player (these are not cinematic but in game scenes) and you can't skip them or do anything at all. Thankfully it only happens a couple of times and they're not long at all.So the question is: would I recommend it? Definitely, even if my review seems harsh, I still enjoyed my time with it.

												A terrifying game, it's jumpscares are very predictable, yet they still manage to keep you on the edge of your seat.It has you checking every corpse in sight with a ranged gunshot to make sure that they're not going to reanimate and slice your body apart.The horror within this game cannot be described with mere words, videos and images are enough to keep you on edge, but being inside the game immerses you to the point where you almost emulate the fear that the player is enduring, a truly shocking experience.You play as Isaac Clark(e?) in the aftermath of Dead Space 1's events, you are lead to believe that you have a mental issue which can be cured if you listen to who is talking to you, both Isaac's ambition to survive the odds given rise to by these messages and your own ambition to run through the blood still keeps you going through the game, despite the offputting level of horror and terror.Excruciatingly terrifying at a certain point where Isaac re-enters the USG Ishimura, only to be met by a swarm of unstoppable necromorphs which swarm him like wasps, the paranoia you feel when you hear a distant necromorph, thinking you've killed them all, and you think they're too far away to reach you in time, but just as you go to run, it's fangs are buried in your leg is undescribable.Most definately a game that gets you thinking; you constantly run in to obstacles which enable you to use your mind to utilize many game mechanics such as Telekinesis and freezing, you are able to freeze certain obstacles in time to ensure that they don't slice you in to millions of pieces as you crawl towards your objective.Do I reccommend this game? absolutely! but it is not for the weak of heart, nor for those who find themselves constantly ragequitting in every game they play.Watch your step, don't turn around unless you hear a ♥♥♥♥ing noise, and most certainly never think that you're alone.

												Dead Space 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece.Beautiful visuals with a great artistic creativity and focused but strong utilization of color throughout. One of the best PC ports created, will run good even on low end systems. Improves upon the first game significantly in terms of gameplay flow, features, enemies, weapons, mechanics. Very strong amount of campaign content, making for quite a few hours of gameplay. Fun to pick up a second or third time. Tense but typically fast paced gameplay.Highly recommend, even if you did not enjoy the first or third game. (Played elsewhere many times)			",1185,453,53,145,140,12,217

So if a game that is kind of a mixture Resident Evil 4 and Metroid (series) sounds like a good time... then I recommend Dead Space 2.			",470,56,26,78,32,3,77

												Dead Space 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece.Beautiful visuals with a great artistic creativity and focused but strong utilization of color throughout. One of the best PC ports created, will run good even on low end systems. Improves upon the first game significantly in terms of gameplay flow, features, enemies, weapons, mechanics. Very strong amount of campaign content, making for quite a few hours of gameplay. Fun to pick up a second or third time. Tense but typically fast paced gameplay.Highly recommend, even if you did not enjoy the first or third game. (Played elsewhere many times)			",1185,453,53,145,140,12,217

												Think Dead Space 2 except a few years have gone by with no memory of those years, and the guy now has a voice. There is a lot more interaction with other characters in this one. Cons? I don't like the new armour/gear system - i preferred upgrading my suit and bag space in dead space 1.Another con: steam doesnt have dead space 3, so I've gone out to buy it on xbox 360.

												A terrifying game, it's jumpscares are very predictable, yet they still manage to keep you on the edge of your seat.It has you checking every corpse in sight with a ranged gunshot to make sure that they're not going to reanimate and slice your body apart.The horror within this game cannot be described with mere words, videos and images are enough to keep you on edge, but being inside the game immerses you to the point where you almost emulate the fear that the player is enduring, a truly shocking experience.You play as Isaac Clark(e?) in the aftermath of Dead Space 1's events, you are lead to believe that you have a mental issue which can be cured if you listen to who is talking to you, both Isaac's ambition to survive the odds given rise to by these messages and your own ambition to run through the blood still keeps you going through the game, despite the offputting level of horror and terror.Excruciatingly terrifying at a certain point where Isaac re-enters the USG Ishimura, only to be met by a swarm of unstoppable necromorphs which swarm him like wasps, the paranoia you feel when you hear a distant necromorph, thinking you've killed them all, and you think they're too far away to reach you in time, but just as you go to run, it's fangs are buried in your leg is undescribable.Most definately a game that gets you thinking; you constantly run in to obstacles which enable you to use your mind to utilize many game mechanics such as Telekinesis and freezing, you are able to freeze certain obstacles in time to ensure that they don't slice you in to millions of pieces as you crawl towards your objective.Do I reccommend this game? absolutely! but it is not for the weak of heart, nor for those who find themselves constantly ragequitting in every game they play.Watch your step, don't turn around unless you hear a ♥♥♥♥ing noise, and most certainly never think that you're alone.

												Even tough i don't enjoy playing horror games that much i do enjoy playing Dead space, it has a great story line and i do recommend this game to anyone that likes a combination of horror and a little bit of a shooter. If you intend to play it try playing it from the first one and then proceed to the second two parts of the game, i really belive most people will find the game scary and entertaining at the same time . :)When it comes to multyplayer it's really awesome but there aren't a lot of players playing it right now, which is kind of a downer. Also the weird thing is Dead space 2 has a multy and Dead space 3 only has a coop without a multy which i perssonaly think is a step back, but hey , you can expect anything from EA.Anyways great game, full recommendation.

												Great game, keeps you on the edge of your seat. Scary atmosphere, sounds are very startling.Recommend playing at night alone in a dark room before going to bed for best experience.Multiplayer is fun, asides from not having an option to disable your voice during gameplay in multiplayer.Thins can be hilarious if you know what to do or have obtaiend the hand cannon, which is for purely entertainment and no lore purpose.Replayability is great, i can keep playing and playing and playing.Storyline is great, almost make a movie out of it.Plot is also good, expect for some twists.Design of weapons and levels and enemies and models are amazing.Fun to experiment which weapon suits you the best, and trying to use a special suit that can give you an advantage with your weapon.Mobs are different, they all don't act the same way.Over all, i give this game 9/10. It's a bit short on storyline.			",81,1,0,9,2,0,0

												I recently just finished my first playthrough of this game. And I have to say......I think Dead Space 2 is even better than the original Dead Space. Don't get me wrong, the first game is still really good and I recommend that you start with that one first, but I feel that Visceral Games just took everything that was wrong with Dead Space 1 and improved upon it. And that is exactly what a sequel should be. I enjoyed this sci-fi horror game from beginning to end. It has a great story, excellent mechanics, better graphics than the first one, and pretty good characters.			",77,4,0,7,2,0,1

												story-story of dead space 2 follows isaac clarke who  is in asylum and has amnesia is awakened by Franco Delille and he is there to help,but before he could cut you out of your straight jacket he s been.....infected i guess  by a necromorph so he transformed to one before isaac eyes (wow.asylum,awakening with amnesia and character thats there only to be suddenly killed,that s 3 horror clichés in a row.)of course you escape and then your getting help by daina,but she betrayes you  because of some cult stuff and you are told that you created a new marker,you escape and your goal is to destroy markerthe first thing i consider a problem in this horror game is that...its not that scaryok,there are  frightening or disturbing moments ,but there are not lot of them and most of the times its all ruined by isaacs voice acting(and by voice acting of everyone else).in a first game he didnt talk,but here he does and he  sounds like an action hero and its distracting,other characters are not that interesting and some would really fit into an action movieand also some jumpscares are lame(for example that fake sun jumpscare)gameplay-even though its kinda lame as an horror game,its actually pretty fun action game,you have again plasma cutter   and you can now impale enemies with help of telekenisis(you have also other guns like flamethrower, impale gun,etc and you can also upgrade them)of course you can also use stasis that slows enemies and its really helpfullalso in certain places you can shoot  the glass so enemies are going to be sucked outand there are even parts where youre going to float in the air because of low gravity(those parts are pretty cool)music is quite decent and graphics are greatto sum up-as a horror game it doesnt (mostly there are some scary parts but there arent lots of them)work,but as an action game its really good,so yeah its kinda like re4-most of the time you wont be scared but youre going to have lots of fun with it7,5/10			",108,17,0,8,3,1,6

												I didn't really like the first Dead Space, the movements were slow, some of the levels were a little too hard, mostly the levels with turrets involved. I spent the most of the play through using the plasma cutter. I even posted a negetive review, about how the story was a bit bland. But after going to the end, I was surprised at the twist at the end, it was refreshing. But the sequel is so much better! Smoother movements, more weapons, more armor, SO much better zero-g game play. The fast that Isaac is now a vocal character and actually is a character that serves to drive the story forward besides just killing stuff was a little off putting at first, but I got used to it fast. And I have a weakness for totally bad♥♥♥♥♥ass kicking, super hot girls with subtle british accents, (Miranda Lawson was my weakness), and Ellie is an awesome character. I'm only on chapter 9, but the fact that you can mow down hoards of deranged deformed children, shot kamakazie babies and make them explode, and nobody asks any questions... just makes this game so far above par it's stupid. Awesome game!			",75,1,0,13,0,0,0

												One of the best games I have ever played, let alone a sequel that completely belittles its predecessor. The envionrment is always changing, there are a good amount of enemy types, the game never feels like a grind, there are plenty of surprises, and you feel like a badass in the engineering suit. The mix of horror and action is perfect. Graphics and performance are both very good, and you won't need anything more than a low-mid range video card to play the game smoothly.I didn't think I'd be saying this before starting this game, but this earns a solid 95/100 from me. The first Dead Space is still a great and recommended play, especially for getting a full picture of the story, but this title is essential survival/action horror.			",59,4,2,4,1,0,3

												This is definitely a good game. But unfortunately it's worse than Dead Space, I understand why - beating such quality is not an easy task. The atmosphere and core gameplay is still here in Dead Space 2 and tweaked to a certain extent, some things have been improved and honestly I don't have much negativity to say about it, maybe just that it's way too similar to Dead Space? Like it's a bad thing, huh? Enemy variety makes things interesting when you encounter new necromorphs and trying to establish some new strategies versus them.So, what's worse then? Pretty much everything else. It's not entirely bad it's just sub par or worse than what Dead Space offered:Very simplistic level design. There's no map this time and it's not even needed there's almost always only one door to enter.Level transitions are usually a QTE/Action scenes which leaves you wondering where the hell you ended up this time, usually you'll partially understand this by reading logs and/or from random intercom messages from various characters. For example in Dead Space there was a monorail and in the wagon you could see a ship scheme so that you understand better where are you heading right now. In Dead Space 2 it's just a sp@stic (this word is censured, wtf steam?) chaos and you'll never be able to fully understand Isaacs route. Characters are much less likable and some are stupidly annoying, like one of the antagonists which always spams your intercom with cheesy threats, like ""NOW IT'S OVER!"" or ""YEAH, NOW IT'S DEFINITELY OVER!"" when it's obvious that it's not... All other characters are ""meh"" as well, and their further development is rather disappointing. On a plus side Isaac brakes his numb record from Ishimura and now talks, sometimes even way too much.Plot is, well, it's much less intriguing to say the least. It's just covers nothing interesting and doesn't really develop Markers/Necromorphs story either. You won't find any bosses in this game, that's really disappointing.On top of that - last part of the game is just big a run-through, dodging some re-used hobo from the original and his friends. That is really really lazy. In Dead Space there was that Marker delivery trip with a lot of fighting and ended up in an amazing boss fight for instance.The good thing is that atmosphere is still pretty grim, new weapons spicing up gameplay in a different ways, RIGs now have special effects and kinesis module is now an awesome tool to kill necromorphs very fast. Now you can freely fly around in Zero Gravity, which is very cool. 5 Difficulty levels this time around with hardcore mode which allows to have only 3 saves throughout the whole game and no checkpoints, it's pretty cool, harder difficulties forces you to use environment to your advantage not just shoot in everything that moves since you'll run out of supplies very fast that way.  Basically - the gameplay is the only thing here that you shouldn't worry about, it's here, it's tweaked and won't disappoint.Dead Space 2 is not a masterpiece like Dead Space, it thrives on the elements of the original game and doing very little to be called a masterpiece on it's own. I still recommend everyone to play it since the quality of this game is astounding and it's a rare thing these days.7/10.			",35,2,1,5,2,0,1

												Dead Space 1 truly set the bar for survival horror when it came out, but was limited by lack of fluidity in both controls and graphics. Dead Space 2 closes the gap completely, and is one of the best third person shooters I have come across. Hours of gameplay will leave you both on the edge of your seat, and on the very back thanks to those jump scares! I highly reccomend this game to anyone that wants an excellent thriller!

												Dead Space 1 truly set the bar for survival horror when it came out, but was limited by lack of fluidity in both controls and graphics. Dead Space 2 closes the gap completely, and is one of the best third person shooters I have come across. Hours of gameplay will leave you both on the edge of your seat, and on the very back thanks to those jump scares! I highly reccomend this game to anyone that wants an excellent thriller!

												This game certainly has some oddities to it (aka bugs but I wouldn’t' call them bugs), such as DLC content being available in the in game store even though I don't have the dlc which kinda made the start of the game easier as the guns/suits cost nothing which you shouldn't have available. I didn't mind though, it gave me variety in what I got to use so I'm not complaining.I never even clicked multiplayer and also I only played this game through once so no idea what those add to the game, I really didn't care about those. I will say I really enjoyed this game, it was probably the first game I found genuinely scary in a long time. When you're not getting over run by aliens jumping right in your face and still advancing even after you shoot their legs off (using their claws) you are wandering around paranoid to hell waiting for them to swarm you. Some really nicely done aliens in here that remind me of the raptors in the kitchen on Jurassic Park (film) where you are getting hunted. You can hear them making noises somewhere in the dark and then you see what looks like a head peaking around behind a box but as you go to shoot it runs back behind and sprints off. Damn packs of the things zipping round really fast, leaping over large containers and jumping at you is quite scary.Some parts got very irritating when I kept dying, particularly when I died after a silly animation scene type thing and had to watch the stupid thing each time. Also I found the end very hard (and at times a bit frustrating) when I kept dying and had to wait for it to load all the time (even with an SSD it wasn't the fastest). I played through on 'survivalist' which I think is the 'hard' option,All in all I did enjoy this and it was scary throughout and I tend not to find things scary. I bought this in a sale and it lasted about 12 hours so well worth whatever I paid for it. There is game mode+ which would extend it's life, it's an oldish game now so I can't see multiplayer adding anything now. I don't really play single player games more than once but you get extra stuff one new game+ which will add for some people. I never played Dead Space 1 and I felt I didn't miss anything from not knowing the previous story.See this in a sale, pick it up.			",160,21,6,31,14,0,25

												I will be honest and straight-forward. The game is worth it. Immersion, story, scares, it has everything you want in a horror game. Main problem.... I recently beat Hardcore Mode. No Hand Cannon unlock. At all. Apparently the only feasible way to fix this is mod you game or download a save online with it, and let's face it, how many Steam users actually know how to mod without corrupting the game? I fall in this catagory and I have a P.O.S. laptop as it is. So, in short, buy the game, enjoy the story, and don't even worry about hardcore mode....			",27,2,0,5,3,0,0

												Basically the same as the first game, though it appears the entire game is now fully action oriented with just a few scares along the way. But still a good game nonetheless. Love the suits, they're awesome. The graphics have been slightly upgraded and your character now actually speaks (I was a bit disappointed by that myself). The voice overs are very good though, and I don't think I have to mention the sounds this time (yes, they're still awesome).If you liked Dead Space 1, this one is a must play as well. I wouldn't necessarily say 'must buy' because it seems this part is becoming the RE4 of DS (which isn't a bad thing, but the horror aspect is being minimized with every DS release it seems).[Rating: 86/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

LMAO!one I met makes his character and the necromorph freeze when it tries to execute him. nothing else freezes, just him and the necromorph. the other necromorphs tried to kill him while he was froze and that is how we know it was not a glitch. there was also 477,945 score, 4,755 kills, 0 deaths (LMAO!), 66 dismembers and 1 rescue on the hackers scoreboard. his name is Anabolic_issac. watch out for it.I recommend the games singleplayer, not multiplayer.

												The “Previously, on Dead Space” video is a nice touch, though it reminds me how similar Dead Space 2's premise and gameplay are to the last one. This time Isaac Clarke awakens on a facility on Saturn's moon Titan, three years after the rescue-mission-gone-awry on the mining ship Ishimura, and finds a very familiar situation: Titan is overrun with space zombies called Necromorphs that have set about the meticulous dismemberment of everyone in sight—and he's still having hallucinations of his dead girlfriend.It also highlights that DS2 is a better sci-fi horror game, in a lot of subtle but important ways. While the plot is similar, the storytelling technique has changed for the better—Isaac has recovered from a bout of Gordon Freeman Syndrome (inexplicable muteness), and the voice performances are excellent. But the real star is the environment: for the entirety of the eight-hour campaign, Visceral does an expert job of making you feel in constant peril, alternating between tingling your spine with unsettling scenery and audio and trying to rip it out of your body by way of horrific monsters. This is what happens if you play Twister during the space-zombie apocalypse.New bloodFighting a Necro is different from other videogame enemies, in that shooting its head is like shooting a grizzly in the foot—it barely slows it down, and just makes it angrier. Picking off limbs takes them down quicker, requiring multiple accurate shots per target—which makes the smooth controls greatly appreciated.DS2 has a zoo's worth of different varieties of spitting, charging, wall-crawling nasties (including evil space-babies), and each puts up a hell of a fight. The first time I was hunted by the new Stalkers was one of the most frightening moments of the game—I caught a shadowy movement behind some crates out of the corner of my eye, but I found nothing there. I heard a chirping noise, and spun around to see a velociraptor-like creature charging toward me. With a scream it smashed me to the floor, then nimbly darted away, intelligently using cover to escape before I could hit its legs. Then, more chirping—and I realized I was surrounded. Clever girl. Stalkers are swift, agile pack hunters. Also, they're jerks.Most of the 15 stages have a unique look to them (as unique as possible given that they're mostly metal corridors), from the wrecked residential areas to the Necro-worshiping Unitologist temple to the EarthGov zone, and they're punctuated by floaty zero-G areas. You have all the same tools as before—the upgradable Rig suit is equipped with time-slowing and telekinesis powers—but the levels are designed well and don't overuse any one gimmick. That includes enemies that must be defeated by blasting their glowing yellow bits.The new multiplayer owes a lot to Left 4 Dead's example: four human players fight their way through a gauntlet of objectives while four class-based Necro players and AI-controlled backup zombies assail them from all sides. It's fun, and produces some nail-biting finishes, but aside from making you unlock equipment with experience (which I don't personally care for), it doesn't do anything we haven't seen before. No you idiot, don\'t shoot it in the head!Overall, besides retaining the irritation of having to seek out a save station to avoid losing progress when I want to quit, DS2 is a smartly improved version of the original. It's not a new experience, but it's a hair-raiser nonetheless.THE VERDICT90/100Dead Space 2An excellent action-horror sequel. Dead Space 2 doesn’t try to innovate, but it’s a highly polished alien-rending experience.			",189,44,1,46,12,1,12

												★★★★★★★★ Review Time ★★★★★★★★★★(Mungkin agak telat reviewnya LOL , game ini keluaran tahun 2011 dan baru saya main kan minggu ini XD)Game Action Survival Horror dari Developer Visceral Games memang patut di acungi jempol. Kompleks Cerita dimulai dari Dead Space pertama yang sukses mendongkrak pamor dari game ini .  Dead Space 2 menceritakan 3 tahun setelah tragedi Dead Space yang pertama.  Isaac Clarke  (tokoh utama) berhasil lolos dari insiden USG Ishimura yang mana dia bertahan dan melawan makhluk alien yang bernama Nechromorphs.Isaac Clarke di Dead Space 2 ini memang menjadi tumpuan musibah . Bayangkan, baru saja game ini di mulai, kita akan di suguhkan cuplikan adegan mengerikan dari kebrutalan Necromorphs. Tidak cukup disitu saja, di pembukaan game ini kita pun harus survive dari kejaran Necromorphs dalam keadaan tangan terikat. Belum lagi game ini disuguhkan dengan Kualitas grafik , detail karakter dan lingkungan , atmosfer , dan soundtrack yang membuat anda lebih baik diam di tempat daripada melanjut kan misi >_<Necromorphs berbeda dengan zombie menurut saya, biasanya di game game yang lain anda cukup menembak kepala saja. Berbeda dengan Necromorphs, menembak kepala saja tidak cukup, anda harus memotong dan menghancurkan tubuh dari Necromorphs itu sendiri XD .Necromorphs di Dead Space 2 ini juga bervariasi, ada yang lambat dan memiliki damage besar, ada yang memiliki kecepatan yang bahkan membuat anda kewalahan mengahadapi nya, ada yang berbentuk mekanisme seperti bom dan ranjau, dan  ada yang mampu menembak kan zat asam.Di Dead Space 2 ini anda masih bisa membeli beberapa ammo, armor, health pack dan  senjata dalam melanjutkan petualangan selanjutnya. Anda cukup mengumpulkan coin dari hasil membunuh Necromorphs atau mendapatkannya dari menjelajah ruangan. Tidak cukup sampai disitu, Dead Space 2 juga ada sistem Upgrade, seperti Upgrade senjata, health dan lain lain. Anda cukup mengumpulkan power node yang berada random di ruangan atau membeli di Shop .Armor di game ini layak nya seperti di game RPG, karena setiap armor memiliki efek dan fungsi masing masing. Ada yang menambahkan efek ke Health, ke Weapon atau ke Armor itu sendiri.Weapon di Dead Space 2 ini pun juga bermacam ragam, ada Plasma Cutter, Heavy Duty Detonator, Agility Rivet Gun, Forged Line Gun dan masih banyak lagi.Oh iya, dalam menggunakan Weapon ini juga ada beberapa mode, mode normal hanya menembakkan seperti biasa, dan mode Space. Ketika anda menggunakan weapon, cukup tekan tombol Space, dan mode dari weapon akan berubah dengan sendiri nya, seperti contoh Forged Line Gun dalam mode normal akan menembakkan listrik , dan ketika mode Space, akan menembak kan ranjau listrik yang akan meledak dalam beberapa detik.Untung nya di game ini di lengkapi dengan Locator yang dapat menunjukkan posisi Save , Bench (Upgrade), Shop dan Objektif selanjutnya . |Setiap arah dari Locator ini dibedakan dari beberapa  warna  seperti warna biru menunjukkan Objective, kuning menunjukkan Shop, Ungu menunjukan posisi Bench, warna hijau menunjukkan posisi Save StationPercayalah , Fitur ini amat sangat membantu kita dalam menamatkan petualangan Isaac Clark. Selain itu masih ada fitur yang menjadi tambahan dalam game ini. Yakni Gadget Kinesis. Fungsi dari fitur ini adalah dapat mengangkat benda benda, tubuh  dan objek lain nya ke udara, juga dapat melemparkan ke arah yang kita mau. Nah, inilah yang menjadi Weapon cadangan. Jika anda kekurangan Ammo, anda tidak perlu cemas. Cukup cari berbagai benda, seperti besi tajam dan angkat menggunakan Gadget Kinesis dan lemparkan ke Necromorphs. Juga ada mode modul Statis. Fungsinya apa? Fungsi mode ini dapat memperlambat gerak suatu objek. Misal pintu Lift, cukup anda tembakkan , dan otomatis Pintu Lift tadi menjadi lambat pergerakanya. Mode ini juga berguna sekali dalam misi, misal anda juga kekurangan Ammo, cukup anda tembakkan modul statis ke objek itu, maka Necromorphs akan bergerak lambat. Disinilah action Punch dan Injakan dapat membunuh Necromorphs.Puzzle juga ada di game ini, gunakan mode Gadget Kinesis dan modul Statis agar mempermudah anda menyelesaikan puzzle tersebut.Visual efek yang menjijikan, Soundtrack yang membuat ngilu kaki untuk melangkah, mekanisme gameplay yang cepat, Panorama Luar Angkasa dan Futuristik yang menjadi nilai tambah game ini, Rentetan Story yang ciamik. Game ini sangat WORTH untuk dimainkan bagi anda pecinta horror game yang ingin memiliki pengalaman berbeda.Nilai dari saya 9/10 Info :  Pertengahan game sempat membuat membuat saya Pusing dan Mual. wkwkwkwkwk XD			",284,43,11,20,29,1,24

												97/100The game is even better than the 1st one.I found a few minor bugs that I think prevent me from giving it a perfect score.Bug 1: When you enter into the stores, and you pull your weapon out... you cant see the amount of ammo you have in the weapon.Bug 2 : You never have to worry about if an enemy is dead because you can EASILY tell they are dead by using kinesis on them.  It sort of ruins the surprise when you have a foolproof way of knowing when your enemy is not dead.  On the other hand, maybe this isnt a bug... but it certainly does rain on the old phrase ""when in doubt, stomp it out"" since there is NEVER any doubt that an enemy is alive or dead with the kinesis trick.Since dead space 1 gave me no trouble on the regular setting and I thought it was too easy, I decided to play this one on the hard setting the first time through... and this one is notably more difficult, but it also probably has to do with my choice to upgrade the pulse rifle and line beam as my top weapons.  I should have stuck with my plasma cutter.Best weapons:1) Plasma Cutter (favorite from last game too)2) Ripper (actually, very versatile, way more useful than it was in the first game... only problem is you gotta get up close... so you pretty much need full kinesis for this to be effective, bad against the guys that freeze you and guys that blow up... good against everything else, can beat really powerful bosses with 2-4 blades and a couple kinesis blasts)3) Seeker Rifle (powerful, but slow... bad in close quarters)4) Detonator.... (this is easily the best weapon to use against the most difficult to deal with enemy in the game, which are these guys who stalk you and do organized attacks)5) Force gun (good versus almost all enemies, especially when being swarmed or in close quarters, not so good in open spaces)6) Flame thrower (better option than the pulse rifle... handles similarly, isnt a piece of crap like it was in the first game)7) Line Gun (powerful if you aim it right)8) Pulse Rifle (lots of ammo, but very weak, not good against the stalkers)9) Contact Beam (good, slow, doesnt carry a lot of ammo, must have good aim)10) Javelin (slow, powerful)11) Rivet gun (total piece of crap, dont know why they even bothered including it in the game)The rivet gun is basically useless.For chapter 15(last level), the ideal 3 weapons to bring are:1) Ripper (to get through the hoards of enemies and regenerating ones)2) Force gun or line gun(force gun is better)... to keep the little enemies from swarming you during the final boss battle.3) And the Seeker rifle OR Javalin... for the final boss itself.But in reality, the plasma cutter is so versatile it is the overall best weapon to bring if you can only afford to take one(which should be the case in your first playthrough).In your first playthrough.. you want to focus on upgrading your suit(only 1 air upgrade is really necessary, if even), your kinesis, and your plasma cutter... and then spend the rest on a second weapon upgrade(maybe the force gun or line gun for the last boss)Like in the first game: Make sure you upgrade capacitiy for weapons when you are empty on ammo(before reloaded) or when you are low... you will get a free ammo refil.Same goes for health: upgrade health capacity when you are low on health(free health refill).Also: buy a new suit when you are low on health(free health refill)			",124,10,2,14,6,1,12

												It plays a little smoother than the original, but it's essentially third person Doom 3 again.  I've never found the horror elements of this series particularly effective, but the combat is fun (if on the easy side).  If you enjoyed the first one, you'll enjoy this - but don't expect it to bring anything new to the table.  The vast majority of the enemy types are identical to DS1, and you even revisit areas from the original title.Worth waiting for a $5 sale, wouldn't pick it up for more than that.

												Games are best when they let you do things you can't necessarily do IRL.In Dead Space 2, for example, you can experience the satisfaction of stomping the ever loving♥♥♥♥♥♥out of little babies while screaming and cursing like a maniac.It's also a very good sci-fi action game but if the baby-stomping part is not your thing, then avoid. Unless you want to complain on the internet about how much offended you got - then you can play it. But then again, no one will care about that crap so maybe just skip the entire thing and go punch yourself in the♥♥♥♥♥♥			",194,16,1,25,6,0,25

												Probably the best game in the franchise. The game is not nessessarily that scary for a ""survival horror"" game but gameplay overall is very good. Controlls are tight, there are some pretty good custimization options with weapons and suits, and Isaac has a voice this time (voice acting is top notch in my opinion). The campaign is a good length and the story is better than most games I've seen though somewhat predictable. If you want the full ""survival"" experience try playing this on the hardest difficulty. Unfortunately the horror part isn't really there all that often but fortunatly that is the only down side. The game gets to be much more of a shooter in the late game. Saddly this may be the last good dead space game as they really dropped the ball with the third game. I reccomend that you also play the original dead space which is more survival horror so get the bundle, and get it while it's on sale. This is probably one of my all time favorite games.

												Jesus where do I even start with this game. One of the best horror games I've ever played. The atmosphere and the whole survival aspect really does stick to this game more than a burger to a fat guy's mouth. Holy ♥♥♥♥. If you are a huge fan of the horror genre and have not played this game, you need to buy this game or else you will be missing out. Really. Just nothing can put into words on how amazing this game is. Great storyline, not just a one of those ""they throw you in a room and you have to survive for no reason."" The shooting is one of the best aspects of the game. Weapons are varied and if you fail to use the right weapon for right mob you will get srewed over. Mistakes punish you harder than you can imagine. Misposition yourself in the slightest and you are welcome to the death screen. This is a gamer's game, you will die alot. But where Dead Space truly does shine is its survival aspect from the necromorphs. It really does make you feel like you are a helpless engineer struggling to survive and it's what most horror games lack these days. Hearing the horrifying screech of a necromorph at the end of a dark corridor will make you regret ever taking that babie's lollipop once you look around the corner. And last but not least surviving a level or two is greatly safistying. I can't tell you how many times and how much my heart raced whenever I got ambushed by a squad of three. Once you chop of one of the limbs it makes you feel as though you are a butcher who murders, in a good way though.Overall, just pick up this game. Definetly worth full price.			",99,21,0,11,6,0,7

												Strange I haven't written anything on this game yet. Dead Space 1 and 2 are my favourite horrors. They are both shining example of how without inventing anything new you can make something that will excell in everything it is trying to do. And in Dead Space 2 you also get some more action, which doesn't make it so difficult to get yourself back into the game, as it gives you some rest from constant tension. Just make sure to take it seriously and have headphones. I know people who just went through it for the sake of completion rather than experience. This is always the worst way to play any game, and especially game like this. Multiplayer is bad, though, don't play it.			",127,14,1,13,4,0,3

												Dead Space 2 is a third person survival horror as you play as Isaac Clarke, a man who has endured a mental condition who must fight against necromorphs and alien species in attempt to reach Diana. A woman who can cure his mental issue. This game has a decent plot with the feeling of dread,agony and pain. A lot of pain. The shooting is executed nicely, using the Resource Intergration Gear to assist you. The shooting is innovative, including a vast amount of gore for the sensation of horror and suspense. The gore can be a bit overwhelming but it's considered creative and it makes the shooting much more addictive. Dead Space 2 is rememberable for the blood but not for it's emotional characters and gameplay. Some chapters do feel repetitive at times or the objective just felt pointless. The scenery is a bit too bland for me, causing me to loss interest in some chapters. Dead Space 2 had some positve touches of third-person shooting that most games don't bring to the table but I really wish it was more emotional for the story it held.  Sometimes cinematic/emotional touches can uplift the intensity or emotion of a game but they failed to do so. Along with some of the missions feeling dull, they kept you on your feet with amusement being properly used when needed. If you like the sight of blood....or shooting unique creatures in the eyes, you will most likely enjoy this game. If you're expecting anything more...don't purchase it. I'll give it a 7.1/10			",78,9,0,3,3,0,1

												97/100The game is even better than the 1st one.I found a few minor bugs that I think prevent me from giving it a perfect score.Bug 1: When you enter into the stores, and you pull your weapon out... you cant see the amount of ammo you have in the weapon.Bug 2 : You never have to worry about if an enemy is dead because you can EASILY tell they are dead by using kinesis on them.  It sort of ruins the surprise when you have a foolproof way of knowing when your enemy is not dead.  On the other hand, maybe this isnt a bug... but it certainly does rain on the old phrase ""when in doubt, stomp it out"" since there is NEVER any doubt that an enemy is alive or dead with the kinesis trick.Since dead space 1 gave me no trouble on the regular setting and I thought it was too easy, I decided to play this one on the hard setting the first time through... and this one is notably more difficult, but it also probably has to do with my choice to upgrade the pulse rifle and line beam as my top weapons.  I should have stuck with my plasma cutter.Best weapons:1) Plasma Cutter (favorite from last game too)2) Ripper (actually, very versatile, way more useful than it was in the first game... only problem is you gotta get up close... so you pretty much need full kinesis for this to be effective, bad against the guys that freeze you and guys that blow up... good against everything else, can beat really powerful bosses with 2-4 blades and a couple kinesis blasts)3) Seeker Rifle (powerful, but slow... bad in close quarters)4) Detonator.... (this is easily the best weapon to use against the most difficult to deal with enemy in the game, which are these guys who stalk you and do organized attacks)5) Force gun (good versus almost all enemies, especially when being swarmed or in close quarters, not so good in open spaces)6) Flame thrower (better option than the pulse rifle... handles similarly, isnt a piece of crap like it was in the first game)7) Line Gun (powerful if you aim it right)8) Pulse Rifle (lots of ammo, but very weak, not good against the stalkers)9) Contact Beam (good, slow, doesnt carry a lot of ammo, must have good aim)10) Javelin (slow, powerful)11) Rivet gun (total piece of crap, dont know why they even bothered including it in the game)The rivet gun is basically useless.For chapter 15(last level), the ideal 3 weapons to bring are:1) Ripper (to get through the hoards of enemies and regenerating ones)2) Force gun or line gun(force gun is better)... to keep the little enemies from swarming you during the final boss battle.3) And the Seeker rifle OR Javalin... for the final boss itself.But in reality, the plasma cutter is so versatile it is the overall best weapon to bring if you can only afford to take one(which should be the case in your first playthrough).In your first playthrough.. you want to focus on upgrading your suit(only 1 air upgrade is really necessary, if even), your kinesis, and your plasma cutter... and then spend the rest on a second weapon upgrade(maybe the force gun or line gun for the last boss)Like in the first game: Make sure you upgrade capacitiy for weapons when you are empty on ammo(before reloaded) or when you are low... you will get a free ammo refil.Same goes for health: upgrade health capacity when you are low on health(free health refill).Also: buy a new suit when you are low on health(free health refill)			",124,10,2,14,6,1,12

												Dead space 2 takes what was good in the first game, pretty much everything and then fixes most of what was bad in the first game, which was the controls and fov and makes a much better sequel that is dark, fun, and you get to shoot up ugly monsters all over the place! What can be better! Just like the first game, the visuals are amazing, even better in DS2. Like mentioned before the controls have been fixed to actually have a fun playable experience that is smooth and fun, very unlike DS1. You go through an amazing set up experiences, great cutscenes and launches into different areas such as anti-gravity, space, vents and tunnels and much much more.Now saying that, yes there are still problems with DS2. You are limited on weapons and armor due to your small inventory space so you normally have to focus on 1 weapon, maybe 2 max instead of enjoying the variety of weapons that the game introduces you to. You have the ability to upgrade your weapons and armor and unlike other games, you don't find ""better"" items later usually, so your fully upgraded weapon is going to be your main weapon for most of the game, because if you find something else it isn't upgraded with 20-30 nodes and is vastly weaker, so why even use it. There is also still the horrible problem with the sound. The sound is great in the game except when it comes to talking and understanding what people are saying. Normal speech is fine but lots of scenes, cutscenes, they try and do ""monster"" voices and such, and they are 100% not able to be understood, which ruins the reason for actually trying to say something in the first place. Way to much ""scary"" modulation which makes the speeches just babble.Still very good game, finally good controls, just wished for better inventory management so you could enjoy all the weapons equally instead of having to wait until new game+'s to use them.

												Dead Space 2:Positives:+ Good shooting, lots of guns to choose from - fun!+ Graphics greatly improved from Dead Space, holding up fine even to 2017 standards.+ Controls and mouse sensitivity are actually decent, unlike Dead Space.+ I didn't experience any motion sickness with Dead Space 2, one of my primary complaints with the first title in the series. Sounds strange that I need to label this as a pro, but given how horrific it was, I'm glad I can actually enjoy Dead Space 2.+ Interesting futuristic sci-fi atmosphere.Mixed ~ Story is nice, but a bit hard to follow. I had to read a plot summary on google after finishing it to fully understand the events.Negatives:- Same alien species from the first game, nothing really new here.- Just like its predecessor, Dead Space 2 is a poor example of horror fiction. You'll get very minimal jump scares, there's nothing frightening about the environment. Wimps and ignorant fanboys will, of course, suggest it is ""super spooky"", when in fact it isn't.- Dead Space 2 tries too hard to be clever, with unoriginal, lame puzzles and annoying, repetitious quick time events where you need to ""react fast or die"". Not smart or cool game design.7.5/10			",66,3,0,9,2,0,8

												Strange I haven't written anything on this game yet. Dead Space 1 and 2 are my favourite horrors. They are both shining example of how without inventing anything new you can make something that will excell in everything it is trying to do. And in Dead Space 2 you also get some more action, which doesn't make it so difficult to get yourself back into the game, as it gives you some rest from constant tension. Just make sure to take it seriously and have headphones. I know people who just went through it for the sake of completion rather than experience. This is always the worst way to play any game, and especially game like this. Multiplayer is bad, though, don't play it.			",127,14,1,13,4,0,3

												Ill be brief and simpleThis is my favorite horror game ever madeThe story is fantastic, the characters are not tired stereotypes that we see in every other horror game known to man, the gameplay is cruel and you have to be ready to fight for your life at every corner, the ending is the best ive ever seen in one of these games, and it does what any good sequel should do, stand out well enough on its own, while still treating the first in the series like the Holy grail of all games ever. This is one every person should own, and Id say play this BEFORE the first one because then the first one is that much more prophetic and revealing if you do it that way. (If you can get the first one to work on your computer, which I cannot) Yes, this is one you need to own.			",243,24,0,11,10,2,5

												If you're like me and loved the first Dead Space, you're likely to enjoy this one too.It didn't take me long to decide Dead Space is one of the my favourite games of all time (in my top 5), and I can pretty much say the same for this one. It feels just as good, is just as much fun, and looks even better!Lots of new enemies, lots of new weapons, very nicely designed areas. Overall, an even bigger feeling game.If you liked the first game, there is absolutely no excuse to not get this one too!			",1346,487,31,186,89,12,152

Posted: December 22, 2016
												So, Ive played the first original dead space (Most of it, not all), and Ive played dead space 2 for the Xbone, and now I would like to contribute what I have learnt from this game.First things first, Ive got a pretty out dated PC (Its a newish PC, the drivers are pretty bad, wont even attempt launching OverWatch), I can play it fullscreen with a decent 45-60 frames low quality, I could probably do high at the same rates, but I'm fine with how it is now. If you have outdated drivers, chances are you can run this pretty well, so don't fret about that.Second thing, gameplay is the most important thing alongside the question ""Can you run this game"". Now this is gonna be the part that destroys this game, ONLY FOR PC. So I started up, decided to do some hard mode for a challenge. About 20 minutes in, Isaac still doesn't have his suit yet, and I'm running around, doing pretty well. Finally get to the shop, and I open it up to buy the suit, first thing- let me rephrase that, multiple things that I see, the whole arsenal of weapons and suits are available to me, 0 CREDITS. Now, the first thing that went through my mind was- ""Oh, all of this stuff has to be unlocked first, yeah."" and so just to test it, I bought a Earth pulse rifle. Got the weapon, full clip. Now, second thing that went throught my mind was- ""Oh, all of this is supposed to be unlockable, why is this existing right now?"" and just like that, went online, ""Why are all the dead space 2 items free"", and apparently the problem was there was a patch previously, and it was a attempt at fixing a bug where you would have to buy items twice to actually get what you paid for. So, naturally, I bought literally everything and equipped the most OP weapons for the up coming boss fight. About 2 minutes later, the boss was obliterated, no sweat. Special side note, this patch exists ONLY for the PC version, Xbone doesn't have this problem, I've played both Xbone and PC now.This is actually really disapointing because it really kills the fear factor to the game when you're literally just a walking tank, you're pretty much unstoppable, especially if youre a good shot, but that could be said with any gun. When you get to the second store, things actually cost money, only default and ammunition items do though.Anyways, third and last place, the story. Story is pretty confusing so far, however most of the time with horror games, I don't care about story, I just like the atmosphere when it isn't DESTROYED by broken patches. I've heard there is a patch online somewhere, but people say it's either really annoying to install or is broken still.IIINNnn conclusion, if you enjoy horror games that make you fight to survive with a challenge, buy this on xbox instead of PC, but if you enjoy horror games that turn out to be Just Cause, definitely buy this.

												Unlike Dead Space this game runs smooth on PC. Its more scarier, faster, enemies are tougher. New weapons and suits.  Single player is great, multiplyer not interseting.  Isac is no longer mute and you have more contact with other surviors. I disabled vysnc in game and manualy set 60FPS trough Nvidia control panel to look smoother. I recommend you doing same. While I hated some parts of game where there were too much enemies and too littlle aid and ammo, the game was most of the time very enjoyable.			",83,9,2,6,1,0,19

												It's Dead Space at it's core but compared to the first game, this one is actually linear and due to this, you don't even have a map anymore. You can't often do backtracking since some form blocking will happen (door locks up, elevator falls, corridor collapses..) and that is kinda big minus but if you're willing to look past that, it's pretty enjoyable and runs well.

												Overall great game, here are a few details:-Good graphics, could've been better for the year in which it was released but still fine. Also well optimized.-Interesting gameplay, staying true to it's prequel's model. TPS based, puzzle minigames like hacking, well interpreted recoil, overall fluid and perfect for a horror game.-Well written story with likeable characters and without a Gary Stue-ish protagonist. Also has a badass female character so feminists can't get triggered.-The horror aspect is on-point, as there's a constant feel of unease throughout the entire game, always keeping a tense athmosphere and never failing to remind players that jumpscares come when you least expect them.Sadly the multiplayer for it and every other Gamespy-based titles is dead, though in this case it's not as much of a loss compared to games like Crysis.An honest 7/10, particularly a great choice for sales.

												The decline of the Horror Survival genre into an action shooter with horror elements can be seen in the transition from Dead Space 1 into 2. The Horror elements are reduced to jump scares and grotesque violence, rather than using the environment and our imaginations to install fear. There's less a sense of Isolation and Confusion as your lead by a carrot through hordes of monsters. The lack of any boss battles and over usage of quick time events are other shortcomings.

												One of the best games I played. I played it for more than 10 times now and well, the developers didn't really care for fixing the game. The rubber foam bonus weapon unlock is not fixed, multiplayer could use some text chat and a push talk features. Enabling the microphone by default is annoying. You can hear static, annoying static.For personal preference, the game could use random enemy spawn similar to Left 4 Dead because after playing the game several times, it's easy to predict when and where the enemies will spawn. With random enemy spawning, the game will be less predictable and different every time you run through a corridor.For the graphics, it's great. The lighting engine is impressive, but there are some instances they cut corners to reduce graphical load for the console versions. For example, your helmet lights illuminate a totally dark room and it's totally absent in another area.Other than that, it's a great game and I highly recommend this to everyone.

												The game has been out long enough that any review I write now about it means jack♥♥♥♥♥♥so I will just say that it is a good game and a great addition to the series. It is basically the same as 1 with a few new weapons, a couple new enemies, and new upgrade systems, although nothing is drastically different just more of the same. That is not a bad thing since Dead Space games are some of the best games that there are. It runs flawlessly on my system. Buy it! This or some coke and hookers. Either way you win.And if you want 60fps don't forget to turn off vsync in game and force it through nvidia control panel or else the game will run at 30fps. If you have a ATI card then figure it out yourself since you are a cheapo.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												I'm recommending you NOT buy this game if you have played the original, because in comparison it's almost an entirely different game from a storytelling point of view. For a start Isaac speaks, I'm all for storytelling but when you establish a franchise like this on the protagonist being silent it allows you the player to make up the character traits for yourself, like Gordon Freeman in Half-life; what is he like? what are his values? etc, in other words, Dead Space one allows you to BE the protagonist.  It works in Half Life, it works in Bioshock 1 and 2, it worked in System Shock and the original Dead Space.... now say goodbye to all that in Dead Space 2, because EA land you with a voice actor, now you CONTROL the protagonist; not as engaging.  The game is also very linear, do not expect to return anywhere you have previously explored, as it will probably be destoryed in some cut scene or the passage way blocked.  Lastly hardly any audio or video logs, mostly text.			",265,44,0,28,7,0,53

												Just as the story page says, ""THE NIGHTMARE RETURNS"".Polished in every single way, overall DS2 is better than DS - increased fundings, experienced team and lots of inspiration and expectations made their trick, and I just got a lot of nice time - spending while playing Dead Space's ancestor. More action, more horror, more weapons, longer story line, more enemies, more locations, functional (but pretty dead for most times) multiplayer, and finally - Isaac Clarke can speak now, which is good too!DS2 is a perfect balance where devs found a golden middle between horror and action. Believe me, playing DS2 on normal difficulty IS challenging and have nothing to do with DS 1 Normal difficulty; here, at the middle of a game, I was starving for supplies, and each combat was unique since I had to use everything I could find to survive out there. Finding a medkit felt like a God's blessing. I don't even know what to expect from hardest difficulty, but that is gonna be a heck of a challenge for sure.Overall, this is one of these games you have to play if you consider yourself being a gamer. It's just... too good to miss it. P.S. Below you can watch a part of my silent walkthrough, feel free to check it out!

												Better than the original in almost every way. While I enjoyed the isolation of the original, this one still manages a lot of creepiness in a sprawling city environment. I don't think any game will be scarier than Amnesia (at least until Frictional's next game) but this still had some ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; moments. The game tends to alternate between beautiful/serene, creepy/disgusting, and blast-your-way-through-the-zombie-horde action.If you enjoyed the original you will most likely enjoy this one even more. If you haven't played the original (and you should) they even included a ""previously on..."" video to explain what happened in DS1.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

Dead Space 2 sees the return of CEC engineer Isaac Clarke into action. Waking up in a hospital shortly after a new Necromorph outbreak on the civilian space establishment called Titan Station, also known as The Sprawl, Isaac must now find out how he got there and escape his ordeal, as he makes some new friends, and, of course, new enemies along the way, including Nicole Brennan, his dead girlfriend hallucination fueled by The Marker.The game itself was similar to the first one, with a few exceptions like the slightly different story, the more frequent human contact and the considerable growth in terms of Necromorphs and locations variation. Dead Space 2 has also more weapons and suits than its predecessor, each suit having its own special bonus, alongside the increased inventory slots and damage resistance of each one. A thing to note here is that the Steam version of Dead Space 2 comes with all the DLC suits and weapons. A good thing you would say, but the downside to this is that all of them are available in the first store, in Chapter 1, for free. These suits can carry you just fine during your first playthrough, even on Zealot, the penultimate difficulty you can chose in the game (the last one is Hardcore, which you unlock after you finish the game once on any difficulty) and the weapons have special bonuses like shortened reloading time and increased primary/secondary damage which, again, can help to make your life easier, but for the sake of experience I would recommend you to wait a few chapters, at least, before grabbing them (no need to worry of spending the Nodes on a non-DLC weapon because the spent nodes on it carry over to the others of the same type). Another thing worth mentioning is that Nercomorph bodies disappear instantly if the body count exceeds, if I remember correctly, five, which can be annoying because, most of the times, you will need to stomp their bodies to get the loot, a thing that can be hardly accomplished during a big fight.The game was, nonetheless, as expected, very enjoying, even on the second playthrough (New Game plus). The newly introduced Necromorphs and the finely forged story portraying Isaac descent into dementia made this sequel as good as the first game.			",16,1,0,6,0,0,1

												Dead Space 2 improves on the first game in almost every way. The story is more coherent and compelling, the action is more prevalent (without detracting from the survival-horror roots), the controls are smoother, and the voice acting, especially from the protagonist, is so good that it makes me yearn for a similarly vocal Clarke in the original.Also, contrary to my feelings on the first game, I found the side-characters to be very well-written and I really cared about the fates of the NPCs, including the villains.My only concern is that the game is too long for the format. There's only so much Necrmorph slaying one can indulge before it becomes repetative. And I feel that, like the first game, I hit that point about 5 or 6 hours into my 9 hour playing time.9/10			",286,54,2,37,37,0,28

 Little Over view Look past all the hate towareds EA (i did before posting this) in a few words This game is AMAZING, but still falls flat in cirtain aspects, my main gripe with Dead Space 2 is that on the easyer difficultys its not very scary because you have lots of ammo and health packs, i highly suggest playing on a higher difficulty that limits thre recorces that you recive making fighting Necromorphs harder when ammunition and health is hard to come by making you leurn how to drop enemys without gut shotting them with the plasma cutter (it is possible to play ONLY using the plasma cutter, ammo is very common for it even on harder difficultys) Overall Look and Feel Despite this game's age  and style it is very pretty in places when looking out of windows over looking satern when your not fighting for your lifeSome of the indoor sections are dark and gloomy creating an atmosphere that is emersive and demands the player to be alert of their sroundings  because you dont know whats going to try and chop your legs off Comparrison to the original Dead Space In many ways Dead Space 2 is an improvments to the gameplay and story, yet it has partly lost some of its mystery to were the necromorphs have come from, but on the other hand it explains a lot and adds more to the story out waighing the negatives, Newer versions of necromorphs vary the combat making stasis more useful in combat other than just to make an escape in a tight squeeze when your outnumberd or ammoless,  Seeing the Ishimora again braught back happy/tence memorys of Dead SpaceShould you play it?YES!, Get this game but i HIGHLY suggest you get the first game aswell because it set up the story for this game (there is a ""prevausly on dead space"" but you would find it better to play though it yourself What would be your rating?If i was to give this game a rating, i would give it an 8.5 out of 10, there are is a lot of good yet some annoying design decisions that EA have made (such as oragin account needed to play on multiplayer, but i consider multiplayer unessasry when the singleplayer is so good), dont let the EA stuff phase you from getting this game (you can decline the sign in ever you start the game so it dosent force you like many people say), With a strong story, tight combat and fun gameplay i encorage you to get this game despite its small design flaws----Biz			",227,17,7,12,11,1,6

												I'm playing my third run through of this game (Very hard mode) and I absolutely love it. There's a lot that Dead Space 2 polishes up from its predecessor and tries to improve upon, however, the key component I feel was missed in DS2 from DS1 is the aspect of horror that was present in the first game - no matter how good your weapons were or how quick your trigger finger was, there was a tension that DS1 offered that left my palms sweating. Not to say that Dead Space 2 is a bad game - far from it. Graphically, animations are more fluid and the interior of the Sprawl is far more varied compared to DS1's USG Ishimura with environments spanning from your DS1-esque machinery and engineering environments, to shopping sections and even a school with multiple classrooms and playground.  This does not mean you can breathe easy though, DS2 still has many environmental hazards and introduces some new ones not present in DS1 and the Necromorphs are a more colorful mix of flavours as well adding several more enemies that are as deadly as the DS1 line-up. Of course, new enemies and a new ship to explore means more toys to wipe out the opposition, right? DS2 has reworked a few of the weapons from DS1, replacing secondary functions such as the Pulse Rifle's ""Panic Barrage"", as I call it from DS1, to an explosive payload that's good for ensuring nothing's left of the bodies you just stomped flat. New ones have stepped in as well such as the slow, but powerful Javelin Gun and if that isn't enough, more RIG suits that can give you a fighting chance when you're a sliver of health away from having yourself torn limb from limb and gutted like a fish. While the game is fantastic, it lacks the same degree of tension I encountered from the first, making up for it with an increased arsenal of firepower, more enemies, more deadly environments and more bloodshed. If you're going to buy this game, I recommend you buy the first one as well.			",154,13,2,12,6,0,7

												Dead Space 2 is a great game, it is allot of fun to play. That being said I would like to point out some things I didnt like. When you get to the first store the game basicly throws you an upgraded version of every single wepon and armor. Some of you might think that this is awesome, you get every gun in the game for free, but to me it makes the game lose its magic. I first played the game on the Xbox 360 and my favorite part of the game is the fact that you have to be smart with your money and recorces in order to win. I would cary around a contact beam just so that i could sell its ammo for 1,000 credits when i reached the store. Every single time i would reach a store i would change from whatever suit i was wearing into the vintage suit just to make the prices go down, i would make my purcases and then change back to my previous suit. Since i carefully played the entire game like this it made newgame plus so rewarding because everything i had i earned. On this version of the game however i didnt get that experiance. I was basicly handed eerything i had worked so hard to get on the 360. As i mentioned at the begining this is a great game and i highly recomend it, but i wish that the free wepons and armor were only given to you after you beat the game once.			",45,6,0,15,2,1,6

 Little Over view Look past all the hate towareds EA (i did before posting this) in a few words This game is AMAZING, but still falls flat in cirtain aspects, my main gripe with Dead Space 2 is that on the easyer difficultys its not very scary because you have lots of ammo and health packs, i highly suggest playing on a higher difficulty that limits thre recorces that you recive making fighting Necromorphs harder when ammunition and health is hard to come by making you leurn how to drop enemys without gut shotting them with the plasma cutter (it is possible to play ONLY using the plasma cutter, ammo is very common for it even on harder difficultys) Overall Look and Feel Despite this game's age  and style it is very pretty in places when looking out of windows over looking satern when your not fighting for your lifeSome of the indoor sections are dark and gloomy creating an atmosphere that is emersive and demands the player to be alert of their sroundings  because you dont know whats going to try and chop your legs off Comparrison to the original Dead Space In many ways Dead Space 2 is an improvments to the gameplay and story, yet it has partly lost some of its mystery to were the necromorphs have come from, but on the other hand it explains a lot and adds more to the story out waighing the negatives, Newer versions of necromorphs vary the combat making stasis more useful in combat other than just to make an escape in a tight squeeze when your outnumberd or ammoless,  Seeing the Ishimora again braught back happy/tence memorys of Dead SpaceShould you play it?YES!, Get this game but i HIGHLY suggest you get the first game aswell because it set up the story for this game (there is a ""prevausly on dead space"" but you would find it better to play though it yourself What would be your rating?If i was to give this game a rating, i would give it an 8.5 out of 10, there are is a lot of good yet some annoying design decisions that EA have made (such as oragin account needed to play on multiplayer, but i consider multiplayer unessasry when the singleplayer is so good), dont let the EA stuff phase you from getting this game (you can decline the sign in ever you start the game so it dosent force you like many people say), With a strong story, tight combat and fun gameplay i encorage you to get this game despite its small design flaws----Biz			",227,17,7,12,11,1,6

												as a player who came from dead space 3 and went back to 2 (i know, im special) this game is a real jump. playing DS3 is a rush, you get the creepiness mixed in with the overused action cuts, but coming on to #2 is a real good choice. I've somewhat touched on the story mode, but the multiplayer is quite fun. it has the Call of duty style level-up-and-get-new♥♥♥♥♥♥and stepping into the shoes of a necromorph is definatly a change of scenery and a great change to the game. the enemy variety certainly keeps you on your toes, from small packs of pac, to the flying infectors. the game has it's bosses, from the armored brute to issac's own mind. and its got those necromorphs that are put in there like the exploders and the exploder/lurker crossbreed thing. gameplay is a bit different from the third game, as im not seeing as many human enemies, and there isnt a real ""sprint"" (if there is, im officialy stupid) theres always the classic curbstomping and melee combat, and the weapons youre given vary a small bit, from the old plasma cutter, to the line gun and spear-shooty-thingy. the variety of weapons and enemies makes for a unique playstyle. i definatly see myself playing this again after i beat itand go play #3 it isnt as bad as people say it is, ya'll need to stop comparing it to this game. (shut up about how i just compared the two)			",46,3,0,7,5,0,5

												Dead Space 2 is a great game, it is allot of fun to play. That being said I would like to point out some things I didnt like. When you get to the first store the game basicly throws you an upgraded version of every single wepon and armor. Some of you might think that this is awesome, you get every gun in the game for free, but to me it makes the game lose its magic. I first played the game on the Xbox 360 and my favorite part of the game is the fact that you have to be smart with your money and recorces in order to win. I would cary around a contact beam just so that i could sell its ammo for 1,000 credits when i reached the store. Every single time i would reach a store i would change from whatever suit i was wearing into the vintage suit just to make the prices go down, i would make my purcases and then change back to my previous suit. Since i carefully played the entire game like this it made newgame plus so rewarding because everything i had i earned. On this version of the game however i didnt get that experiance. I was basicly handed eerything i had worked so hard to get on the 360. As i mentioned at the begining this is a great game and i highly recomend it, but i wish that the free wepons and armor were only given to you after you beat the game once.			",45,6,0,15,2,1,6

												Great game, part of a great series.  The monsters are well designed, as is the general atmosphere.  The idea of dismemberment to kill is great (though toned down in this game compared to 1, to the point where the sniper rifle is the best gun in the game).  The acting and characterisation are somewhat weak though.			",93,15,1,31,11,0,22

If you want a scary game play Amnesia-The story is quite good if you don't count couple of rushes.-Waaaaaay too many terrible ""jump scares""-It repeats♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over. For example ""Power surge"" *Couple of monsters pop up* You better get used to it.-Difficulties seem to be broken. I'm playing on normal and it seems like it's on easy.-Boss battles are ♥♥♥♥♥♥-Suits are quite cool and each one has it's own benefits.-Ammo costs way too much. 1250 for 25 pulserounds? ♥♥♥♥ your♥♥♥♥♥♥-Seems like upgrading your gun doesn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥-Sometimes annoying level design, there is one part where you have to reaim solar panels and there are things flying perfectly in space...-The monsters are immune to the vaccuum of space. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-Only a couple of characters with good voice acting.-And still. This game is not ♥♥♥♥ing scary. Seriously, it's desperately trying to scare you. Bodies dropping from the ceiling ""♥♥♥♥ING SCARY!"".Overall this game isn't bad. Just little bit wanky. Still worth a buy though. If it's 75% in discount.			",130,17,0,16,9,1,12

												It's okay. I didn't find it scary, but I didn't think the first was either. The action and gameplay is still solid, graphics look(ed) shiny, and the multiplayer appears fun though I have yet to try it. My major complaint with the game is the loading. I'd prefer a good old fashioned loading screen, rather than watch Issac sit in an elevator for 30 seconds. I don't have much to say, if you're a fan of Resident Evil 4, or god help you, RE5, you'll probably enjoy this. This just has an upgraded gameplay style of them and attempts to be scary. You might need an Origin account to play online since EA went to trash, but the game is still fine in Single Player. The game really felt a little like the fighting at the end was rushed, and the story was left open for a sequel. 8.5/10.			",508,104,12,60,23,7,29

												as a player who came from dead space 3 and went back to 2 (i know, im special) this game is a real jump. playing DS3 is a rush, you get the creepiness mixed in with the overused action cuts, but coming on to #2 is a real good choice. I've somewhat touched on the story mode, but the multiplayer is quite fun. it has the Call of duty style level-up-and-get-new♥♥♥♥♥♥and stepping into the shoes of a necromorph is definatly a change of scenery and a great change to the game. the enemy variety certainly keeps you on your toes, from small packs of pac, to the flying infectors. the game has it's bosses, from the armored brute to issac's own mind. and its got those necromorphs that are put in there like the exploders and the exploder/lurker crossbreed thing. gameplay is a bit different from the third game, as im not seeing as many human enemies, and there isnt a real ""sprint"" (if there is, im officialy stupid) theres always the classic curbstomping and melee combat, and the weapons youre given vary a small bit, from the old plasma cutter, to the line gun and spear-shooty-thingy. the variety of weapons and enemies makes for a unique playstyle. i definatly see myself playing this again after i beat itand go play #3 it isnt as bad as people say it is, ya'll need to stop comparing it to this game. (shut up about how i just compared the two)			",46,3,0,7,5,0,5

 Little Over view Look past all the hate towareds EA (i did before posting this) in a few words This game is AMAZING, but still falls flat in cirtain aspects, my main gripe with Dead Space 2 is that on the easyer difficultys its not very scary because you have lots of ammo and health packs, i highly suggest playing on a higher difficulty that limits thre recorces that you recive making fighting Necromorphs harder when ammunition and health is hard to come by making you leurn how to drop enemys without gut shotting them with the plasma cutter (it is possible to play ONLY using the plasma cutter, ammo is very common for it even on harder difficultys) Overall Look and Feel Despite this game's age  and style it is very pretty in places when looking out of windows over looking satern when your not fighting for your lifeSome of the indoor sections are dark and gloomy creating an atmosphere that is emersive and demands the player to be alert of their sroundings  because you dont know whats going to try and chop your legs off Comparrison to the original Dead Space In many ways Dead Space 2 is an improvments to the gameplay and story, yet it has partly lost some of its mystery to were the necromorphs have come from, but on the other hand it explains a lot and adds more to the story out waighing the negatives, Newer versions of necromorphs vary the combat making stasis more useful in combat other than just to make an escape in a tight squeeze when your outnumberd or ammoless,  Seeing the Ishimora again braught back happy/tence memorys of Dead SpaceShould you play it?YES!, Get this game but i HIGHLY suggest you get the first game aswell because it set up the story for this game (there is a ""prevausly on dead space"" but you would find it better to play though it yourself What would be your rating?If i was to give this game a rating, i would give it an 8.5 out of 10, there are is a lot of good yet some annoying design decisions that EA have made (such as oragin account needed to play on multiplayer, but i consider multiplayer unessasry when the singleplayer is so good), dont let the EA stuff phase you from getting this game (you can decline the sign in ever you start the game so it dosent force you like many people say), With a strong story, tight combat and fun gameplay i encorage you to get this game despite its small design flaws----Biz			",227,17,7,12,11,1,6

												An okay game. Basically the same game as Dead Space (1) but with a worse story. Satisfying combat and good UI, very well built environments. Making Isaac a non-anonymous protagonist was a bad decision, since before the story was somewhat excusable. This game suffers from the same problems as the previous, in that the jump scares becomes really predictable after a while. The story is basically built around the formula: get to X to escape, X is broken/blocked/gone, get to Y to escape instead, repeat.If all you want is more of the satisfying Dead Space combat, I can recommend this game. Otherwise you should probably play something else instead.			",169,40,2,23,20,3,56

												I know my playtime at the time of writing this is just over an hour but on my 360 i have over 100 hours logged on that Bich,so without further ado lets get to the review!Singleplayer is an absolutly amazing 9/10The gunplay and movements are more fluid than the first game.The overall horror while not as creepy as the Ishimura was in the first game still holds up Supremly well.And Issac (The Main Protaganist) has a personality which very Damn impressive.Multiplayer on the otherhand seems rushed to me, like it was created in the last 2 months of Development rushed.Overall The singleplayer is the main focus of the game and what you should stick to.Also Nicole is a Bich!

												good game, wait for a week or two before getting it... patches needed for a few issues.edit:patches dont do much... still has the same graphic/video issues as the first one.it is a good game overall, slightly better than the orignal because of the armor stats and stuff... but they went overboard with armors, instead of making a single armor type and then allowing you to customize it they creating multiple versions of the same armor suite with different textures (lazy bastereds).end game is exactly the same as the first one, run away from special boss that you cant kill till the very last moment, and then do something incredibly stupid that clark wouldnt do (from the rest of the canon created in this and the first game) by being duped into stuff again.

												Dead Space 2 is a great game 8.5/10!The story is pretty good 8/10. Several twists and turns. It sure helps to have played Dead Space first.The difficulty settings give is some extra play through value. Along with the option to start a new game with all the items you gathered in a previous game. 10/10The game is really linear 5/10. If you like linear games it's great, but I'd rather explore and have to figure out may way. If Dea Space 2 was an open wolrd (for the most part), being able to go all over an entire space station, where enemies could pop up at any moment, this game would get max score. Because it's linear the enemies have predefined appearances and so the second go around you know where the enemies pop up. Very much tied to a set story.If the story was more tree like, with other endings or outcomes this would really bring this game over the top, but it doesn't do that.The graphics are great, nuff said.The movement is a bit restrictive, but they do this to add to the horrer effect. It's great that the enemies move much faster than you, other wise you would be shocked when something pops out.Enemy variety is lacking 6/10. Later in the game you see the same monsters but with slightly different color that have more hitting power and health, but their tactics are the same. They should come up with better kill strategies that are more complex than just shooting, like adding some environmental things into a strategy to kill bosses.They need to have a bit more movement in the charater, like jumping, which is none existent. But the zero-gravity sections are great, where you get to fly around. I wish there were a lot more of this kind of stuff though. 7/10The game mechanics are good. 7/10 They have leveling of items and a growth tier system, so you have a sense of progression, unlike Gears of War. It's nice to have a progression system but it is minimum, they should have a bit more with regard to progression systems.Sounds are great 9/10Overall, dead space is a safe game to add to your collection. Most of these recommendations are for the devs who should build out the game a bit more to make it a stellar game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a big fan of the first Dead Space I was waiting for this game anxiously. I did not get disappointed. Dead Space 2 is maybe little less scary than its predecessor but it creates even better atmosphere with excellent sound and level design. Also controls and graphics improved slightly.If you enjoyed Dead Space 1 - go grab this one too.			",173,19,6,21,41,1,7

												Pros:-A variety of unique weapons that allow for slightly varied combat approaches.-An equipment custimization system that is easy to use and provides opportunity for player choice.-Some interesting puzzle elements not often found in the genre.-Visual design is quite good in most areas.-Creates a strong atmosphere of dread, terror, and horror in some areas.-Good graphics quality, even for 2015, lots of well rendered gore.Cons:-Aside from a few unique enemies, most enemy designs follow the exact same formula.-Level design is very repetitive, be prepared for many enemy-filled corridors.-The game is quite dark, and although you have a flashlight on your gun, in some areas it's just an annoyance instead of being scary.-The 3rd quarter of the game onwards gets super grindy with just tons and tons of enemies being thrown at you.-The difficulty of the game does not flow well.  In the early parts, even the difficulty above normal is easy, in the later half, even normal can be frustratingly difficult.  Higher difficulty does not really make the game more challenging in a fun way and instead simply makes to so you die way more easily.-This game is full of shrieks and loud static noises.  I had to turn the sound down because it was causing headaches.-It's a gore-fest.I am not reccommending this game because I think that in trying to be a action-horror hybrid, it falls short of each of it's parent genres in many ways.  Dead Space 2 is not a terrible game, but it is also pretty forgetable, and doesn't really excel in any way.If you are looking for a gory space horror shooter to romp through I would recommend trying to pick it up on sale for a good price (<$10) and don't be averse to playing on a low difficulty.(Note: the game comes with a bunch of free DLC weapons and armor which can trivialize the game.  If you want to have the original experience, do not purchase any weapons or armor from the store that cost 0 credits)			",110,48,0,15,11,2,10

Keep in mind this is my personal opinion and if you are among the majority of people who enjoyed this game, then good for you, you can move on.I am a Silent Hill enthusiast, I like horror games and so on but Dead Space 2 is not a scary game. Of course, most people tend to♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants whenever a light flicks but if you aren't easily scared chances are you will find this game boring, tedious and tiresome. I thought the first game wasn't too bad despite being a tad frustrating at times, but blimey I wasn't prepared for the amount of frustration this one can create.First off, if you purchased this game and you expected to play it right away, you won't. EA will ask you to login with your EA account and they will try to convince you to do so by telling you you'll miss on some 'amazing' bonus content. But you can skip that part and avoid spending an hour trying remember what password your useless EA account had. Which is nice.The game is filled with QTE which I'm not a fan of but usually don't mind. But Dead Space 2's QTE are terrible. For some reasons you can't just casually press E but you have to mash it like a maniac and still, sometimes you end up dying anyway. It's like you are meant to die and enjoy your death scene - because they put so much effort into these - and retry. My childhood was essentially me playing Metal Gear Solid so I know how to repeatedly press a single key, thanks to the torture part. Dead Space 2's QTE are essentially MGS' torture part. Every five minutes.The atmosphere of the game isn't too bad but it's completely ruined by the staggering amount of cheap jumpscares. When will game developers get that jumpscares aren't scary, they are just downright irritating. It wouldn't be so bad if they actually had just a few of them but no, the entire game is based on that. This clearly doesn't help you getting into the story, which by the way, is utterly predictable and cliché. Not once, was I even slightly surprised by any of the ""plot twists"". Even Dead Space 1 managed to do that.You are also expected to do every tiny bit of action which adds absolutely nothing to the experience. I can't remember how many times I asked myself ""Am I actually supposed to do something or is this a cut-scene?"". And sometimes, the game also expects you to figure out stupid stuff you were never asked to do before like holding E instead of just pressing it. I did every single action just by pressing E, how am I supposed to figure out for this ONE action in the game I am supposed to hold E. I am not even kidding, there's actually some bloke in the devs team who thought for this ONE SINGLE ACTION it would add a lot to the game if you had to hold E instead of just pressing it. Unbelievable.It might sound like details to you, but believe me this ruins the entire purpose of a game, which is to be enjoyable. The only thing I was looking forward to was the end, so I could just let this game rot in my Steam library and never hit the play button ever again. But guess what, those were the longest 12 hours of gameplay in my entire life. This game feels like it never ends. Not to mention they thought it'd be a brilliant idea if that massively annoying regenerating necromorph would come and chase you while dozens of enemies kept spawning all around you.I won't even mention the final boss fight*.Overall this game is a huge let down. They apparently managed to make Dead Space 3 even worse but I find it hard to believe. There are a few nice things to say about this game like the details they added into the environment and level design. Isaac feels less ""stiff"" and moving around feels way more natural. You can also kill babies and children which is something I wished games like Skyrim allowed you to do. But that's not enough to compete with the tremendous amount of problems this game has.*PS:The final boss fight is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ",41,8,0,12,7,1,2

												don't buy this gameNot becuase it's bad, it's actually one of the best in the genere and the best DS game out of the 3.the problem is the DRM system that allows a max of 10 installs, after that the game is locked and unlocking it in my experience has been a pain in the rear to the point that i had to get the game through...other means. just to enjoy something i paid for			",79,6,1,12,2,0,3

												Honestly I think this is the best game of the series. The controls are improved from Dead Space 1, the surroundings are more expansive than the first one and the new enemies are also good. It's not as slow-paced and horror as Dead Space 1, but it's not as action based(and crap) as Dead Space 3.			",414,70,5,35,28,3,36

												It tries to sell itself as action-survival-horror, seemingly oblivious to the fact that action and horror are diametrically opposed.Just like every other game where action is meant to be balanced alongside horror, the horror falls flat.  If you want a gory shooter, this works well.  If you're looking for something actually scary, try Silent Hill, Amnesia, or some other choice horror games.			",82,7,2,6,8,3,14

												Don't buy it. I bought it a while ago, the single player is great, yes. But if you want to play the multiplayer, don't. Barely anyone plays it anymore, and I had problems with my Account at EA after a few weeks (Seems like my E-mail got cut on their end, since the jackass at the EA support said the E-mail given for the acount was ""@gmx.com without anything else.) Well, I tried my best to get them to make my account working again, and after months of ignoring they offered me a 10% discount if I rebuy the game. Just crack it, don't give those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s from EA any more money.			",111,19,0,20,10,3,7

												As you go through the process of playing this game, it is clear that this game is a labor of love. The attention to detail in the enviroment, sound design, and overall design of the necromorphs makes this game some of the best sci-fi horror ever made. Every necromorph has something especially disturbing that you notice about them after the first time you see them, wether that be the way that the pukers crawl after you with a vengance after you take out their legs, or the way those walrus lookin♥♥♥♥♥necromorph's jaws are horribly distended. I highly reccomend this game for its atmosphere and chilling enemy design.Things to consider:-The game is frame locked at 30 FPS if you enable some settings in the game. I wont explain it here, but just do some quick research if it bothers you, it is very easily fixed so you can play at 60 FPS with AA.-My personal reccomendation is on your first playthrough start on the easier difficulties: That way, you can focus less on being frustrated because you are constantly dying and more on the how fast things are going to hell-If you want to win, upgrade the crap out of your plasma cutter and keep the semiconductors the game gives to ensure you always have ammo for it (sell the semiconductors and buy ammo at the shop)and dont forgetaim for the legs :) ",38,4,1,2,2,0,3

												Dead Space 2 offers the same doggedly linear levels and repetitive but engaging combat as the original, while adding a dusting of Very Serious psychodrama that may be, in both concept and execution, the least insightful portrait of grief in narrative fiction history. Neither its good ideas or its bad ones are original; it plays it safe all the way, for a game that is super polished but doesn't leave much of an impression. I'm not really mad at this game, mostly because it's nice and short and I got it on sale. So long, Dead Space 2. You were 10-ish hours of my life I will neither miss nor regret.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hell yeah, the sequel to the only original IP that Electronic Arts has probably made in a billion years. So the series continues its sci-fi induced survival horror gore-fest, and let me tell you, this game gives me an incredible huge boner. The best part? They fixed all the mouse issues associated with the first game so it actually controls ♥♥♥♥ing normally this time! Beyond that, the game is bloody and awesome if you like killing mutated aliens by blowing off their limbs. If you do not enjoy such activities you are probably a homosexual and enjoy riding♥♥♥♥♥♥instead. Either, Dead Space 2 ♥♥♥♥ing rocks as much as the first game.So the first thing you will notice when booting up this game is that the graphics in the game are way superior to the first. The first game looked pretty damn nice but had a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of low-resolution textures which made my♥♥♥♥♥♥sad, this is less the case with this game. Everything has graphically improved by a good generation of so and makes it much more pleasing on the eyes. The environments, while still cramped to an extent to give a greater sense of tension, have a ♥♥♥♥-ton more detail as well as being better designed. You go through various environments and they actually feel more alive, like people were once living there and you jack-off as you watch them get brutally murdered. I probably came over a thousand times just watching people die. Murder Boner. Beyond that, the environments in this game can be much more varied since you are no longer stuck on the Ishimura, which still was cool. You actually take a trip back there in the game and revisit certain old locations, but now you are aboard a space station, travelling through malls, living quarters, medical labs, outside in a big satellite and a couple of other locations. In essence, you go through a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton more environments than you did in the first game but they will have the same ""space station"" feel. Beyond that, the game is still filled with the bloody ♥♥♥♥ing goodness of blowing off a ♥♥♥♥ ton of limbs off of different enemies. There are some of the same enemies from the first games but abunch of new ones you get to murder in the most brutal of ways. There are now these children who attack you and I LAUGH as I blow them all away and then stomp on their corpses to get all their ammo and money! DIE ♥♥♥♥ERS DIE! While playing this game you will notice that they fixed all the problems with the mouse controls so there is no longer some weird♥♥♥♥♥input lag whenever V-Sync is turned on, and thus makes the game less irritating. The gameplay is essentially the same with you going around blowing the ♥♥♥♥ out of enemies with different guns, upgrading them and your suit with power nodes, and buying new suits and ammo, not much has changed here. One cool thing they added was the telekinesis module so that you could blow apart enemies with their own limbs. I ♥♥♥♥ing rip spikes off of dead enemies and send them through the heads of other enemies. The gameplay is still fun as balls, and not so much scary, as it is just enjoyable to blow everything away.The brutal gory death scenes still take place in the game with my favorite being the EYE STAB! You have this puzzle of focusing a laser on an eye to extract some sort of information for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Well if you ♥♥♥♥ up it stabs out his eyeballs and the game ends with him screaming and blood flying everywhere. Haha. Enjoyable.The sound in the game is still ♥♥♥♥ing excellent with the audio soaked in reverb to give all of the audio a distant and eerie sound. It really makes the audio much more enjoyable and unique feel to it. One thing you will also notice is that Isaac talks quite a bit this time around. He no longer looks like an old man as he did in the first game and instead tells people to ♥♥♥♥ing die. Its excellent as I'm ♥♥♥♥ing mashing enemies into the ground with my mighty space boot he is yelling, ""DIE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ER."" Brings me back the days of Kingpin when I would laugh blowing someones arm off and swearing at them at the same time. The dialog is all fairly interesting and the sound is really well done with plenty of music and ambiance to fill the game with a creepy♥♥♥♥♥atmosphere.The story continues where it left off at the first game with Isaac being used for experiments to build new markers which abunch of ♥♥♥♥ing crazy people start worshiping. Eventually, after being betrayed by pretty much everyone around you, and one of your friends getting her ♥♥♥♥ing eye stabbed out, you make your way to the marker and destroy the new one. Not too much ground is covered but you learn a little bit about the universe. The whole ♥♥♥♥ing game is great with blowing away a♥♥♥♥♥♥of enemies, using stasis to freeze them in mid-air and blow their ♥♥♥♥ing legs off. The only problem I have is the boss fight at the end was ♥♥♥♥ing simply. I just blasted the big bulbous orb with my contact beam and killed everyone. It was glorious death and gave me a boner.The game is the same gore filled fest as the first with improved graphics, controls and a bloody boner-inducing continuation of the story 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you liked ""Dead Space"" you will most likely like it's successor as well. I did not. It's not like ""Dead Space 2"" is complete waste of time and money. It's just... great example that putting proven elements in one jar and making game of them is simply not enough. Dark environment? Checked. But instead of creating atmosphere of fear and danger. Something chocking? Checked. This time it's necromorph infested kindergarden. And come on... How many times we saw juxtapose of defnesless and innocent kid-stuff with something gore, hoping that the contrast will hit the viewer? Generally locations are poor and repetitive. While devs managed to avoid backtracking, they did not put much work in location design and you will walka lot through mirror imige of location you were just before... More - ""WTF is happening?!"" strat? Checked. Been there. Done that. Dozens of times. Plot twist? Checked. Unfortunately they are so predictable... And of course - some scary paranormal stuff. Checked as well. But again, ghost of Nicole is more irritating than scary. You can barely understand what she is saying. And when you do you will realize it has little sense. ""Dead Space 2"" has it's strong point. Like guns. I'm pretty sure everybody will find something for themselves. Personally  I favored combination of Plasma Cutter (one of few things that are awesome), Pulse Rifle, Seeker Rifle and Javelin Gun. Also graphics quality is really good. There are also few good movie-like parts. But too few, even for such a short game. Oh, and to be honest - since Chapter 12 interesting stuff starts. But whole games has 15 chapters. And last one is pretty much just Boss fight. So yeah, ""Dead Space 2"" has some strong points. But they are not enough to call this games good...			",118,10,0,17,5,1,15

												I was very much looking forward to playing this game. As I finally got the chance to play it, despite having it in my collection for a long while now, I played for around an hour. PROS:- The story seems very interesting.- Good graphics for its time.- Good cinematic scenes.CONS:- The camera kills this game. It was nauseating, and the fact that the camera is on the left shoulder of the character makes this game unplayable. - Lack of actual ingame options to modify makes this game feel like it's missing a lot of depth.- No actual save states - you can only save by going up to a terminal. Uhm... why are there checkpoints instead?-  During the first scene where you run, I could not for the life of me understand that you needed to press on a button to fight back a specific enemy (while in the straightjacket). I needed to go on youtube to figure out what I was doing wrong. As I was using my PC keyboard, the onscreen instructions - for some reason - did not properly appear. The fact that they couldn't even get this simple vital thing in the game... you know, onscreen instructions, made me so annoyed as I kept dying ~10 times as I tried figuring out what I was doing wrong. Which happened to be nothing, as it was the game that was improperly designed. ",57,9,1,19,16,0,35

												Throughout the game I was leaning towards a weak ""not-recommended"" rating, even though the maps were neat and there are worse ways to spend a handful of hours.  The ending of this game turned the weak ""not-recommended"" into a strong ""do not buy this game at any price"".First, at least if you are playing on a PC, this game has horrible field-of-view.  This is so the game designers can ""scare"" you by making monsters appear in the 320 degrees that you cannot see.  A lot of the game is swinging the view around to try and figure out where some hellspawn is shanking you with a claw.  That's a jump scare that gets old real quick.It's like a lot of other console ports, the gameplay is clunky.  However, in this game, there is zero redeeming story.  It's basically a less-playable DOOM with bad FOV.  Really nice graphics and really neat maps which is what kept me playing until the end, even though it is an unapologetic 100% corridor-shooter.And then the end, which drags on and on.  The game play changes suddenly and you die a lot.  Pretty sure the only reason for this is to show you several types of ""fatality"" animations for your character.  You'd think this could be interesting but you are so uninvested in the character at this point that it is simply tedious.			",111,52,0,6,6,0,6

												Interesting idea but poor execution. It is basically like any other horror survival game but is a direct port from a console game and shows it. The enemies just appear at random, the atmosphere (which should be a huge part of the game) is barely there, the path is just too linear. It feels like you are watching a grade B slasher flick instead of something like ""Alien"" (which does a great job of bringing to life the horror feeling).			",274,88,3,38,43,1,88

												While I'd recommend this one as it is one of my favorites in the franchise, I'd suggest going for a console version instead of the PC. Mainly due to the button for escaping nasty situations is really really hard to see on the PC, the keyboard controls are more clunky to deal with & for some reason the 360 Microsoft controller which works fine for Dead Space1 (and many other games with very little hassle to switch from keyboard to controller) isn't registering on Dead Space2.

												I played this game immediately after finishing the first, and was almost entirely disappointed with it.Dead Space 2 takes the essentials of Dead Space 1, and then scraps everything about the first that made it immersive by giving the main character a voice. Issac can somehow make sassy remarks and sharp quips for comic relief despite being an absolute mess of a human that talks to himself and frequently yells at his long dead girlfriend.  By sacrificing Isaac's anonymity, the game is able to produce story arcs where he can bond with whoever has his frequency, which pulls entirely away from the ""trying to survive and not think about all the things I'm killing"" vibe and brings it closer to the ""I guess I'll help this crazy guy get get off this station.""  By giving Isaac a voice, the game becomes less of a game and more of an interactive movie: You are not Isaac, you are just in charge of his fate.On gameplay, the puzzles are a little more interesting, and the minigames are reduced down to just one hacking-thing, which is a step up from the original.  Combat feels almost identical to Dead Space 1, with one major exception: Kill Rooms.  You will frequently find rooms in the game where you just back into a corner and kill 15 or so enemies as they file in, which is both tedious and frustrating.  Enemies go from being a obstacles (DS1) to being switches you have to flip (dismember) so that the next room will open up so that you can do it all over again. The fighting can only be considered difficult if you find that managing your resources is also hard; as long as you have ammo, you're fine.  I played this game on survivalist difficulty, and would definetly recommend that it should not be played so, as all it seemed to do was make me sell all my extra health packs for 3 clips of ammo to blow out at the next 15 dudes due to there being almost no ammo anywhere.  Healing is never really an issue in the game, as more often than not when you are taking damage you are just going to die anyway.As a side note, the game makes a whole bunch of side-grade weapons available to you in the shop for free, which is silly as the actual weapons are expensive and require schematics to be purchased.  I only used side-grades if I had already purchased the standard copy, but there is nothing stopping you from grabbing high-teir stuff at the first shop.I played this game with a controller, as all user interface and minigames are designed to be done using joysticks, not a mouse.Relative to Dead Space 1, this is not a great game.Ignoring Dead Space 1, this game is not bad, and probably worth playing if you enjoy some sci-fi horror in your linear plot driven shooters.Expect about 12 hours of gameplay, with some replayability in newgame+ mode.

Product received for free
												The game and the gameplay itself is legit.  Isaac Clarke became a dancer in this game if how often I make him stomp the yard (or enemies if we're splitting hairs here) is any indicator.  The environment and the overall survival-adventure genre gives your heart a steady workout as you play the game, but nothing too drastic to keep you from copping out.Despite all this however, I would have to give this game review a solid no.  And it's because the programmer for this game thought he was really funny and proceeded to ♥♥♥♥ up the programming or something for Dead Space 2.  More often than not, when you try to reload or respawn, there will be times where you will respawn empty-handed.  As in no weapons, which means not even the chance to perform melee haymakers.  You are straight up walking around empty-handed like a dumbass badass straight into a necromorph thinking you hot♥♥♥♥♥♥and all that only for you to expectedly get torn a new one.  Yes i've checked my inventory, yes i've tried to reequip my handy-dandy plasma cutter.  Nothing.  You're only option left is to reload the game again (if your dumbass saved while knowing this happened, you might very well have permanently lost that item forever unless you start a new game completely, fully-upgraded or not).  If you have really bad luck when you reload a last save, you might be caught in the loading screen forever until you decide to just quit the program itself and reload the last save (goodbye hours of progress).  But my biggest issue with this game is that for whatever the ♥♥♥♥ reason, EA thought it was a good idea to give the player every DLC weapon/armor at the start of the game, doesn't matter if you started fresh or beated the game.  From the moment you reach the first shop in the game, it's decked with weapons that can fill your inventory and armor that gives some pretty decent buffs.  Whats worse is that all of these DLC are free, no credits are needed.  If you're like me and you like the challenge of grinding through a game and actually earning your upgrades, then this is a serious turn off.  One can suggest to just ignore these free stuff and play the game as is, but the fact that these items exist at all without our say leaves a bad taste to the mouth.  There is a way to manually turn the DLC off through coding, but honestly the fact that you have to go through all that at all just to play a vanilla version of a game is jsut disgusting.  So to sum it all off, ignoring all the flaws that i've listed out, the gameplay overall is still similar to the first Dead Space we all played and enjoyed (or hated, i don't know how you roll).  It's still fun to literally curb stomp the♥♥♥♥♥♥on not just your enemies, but also dead civilians into delicious chunks.  My recommendation is that you take these complaints into serious consideration (check Google, it's not just me having these problems) and to get this game ONLY if it's on a serious sale or is given to you free.

												Amazing... Dead Space 1 was great. Dead Space 2 was something else. There was nothing wrong with Dead Space 1 but this is many times better. I am utterly speachless. I just don't know what to say.I had originally left a bad review due to extreme dificulty impeeding progression fairly early. It was at the church, there were these weirdos that gangbanged on you and they were nearly impossible. This isn't much of a spoiler by the way. If you get stuck here, make sure you get a Line Gun early on, and aim at their legs when they charge.This game actually disturbed me. The babies... They pop... There were a few WTF moments throughout the game, things like, you're just walking and SUPRISE!!!The story was actually a story this time. Isaac actually talks now. Alot of times, sequals tend to go far from what the original was. This is not the case, it is still Dead Space and you can tell. The only thing I didn't like was that there were no big bosses. In Dead Space there was Meat Wall (The Leviathan), Meat Patty (The Slug) and Wormy (The Hive Mind), and in Dead Space 2, there were a few boss like creatures but not really. I was really excited for a big♥♥♥♥♥monster like those but there was nothing really. Money is much more numerous and the ammo struggle isn't too bad. Power Nodes are everywhere now too. It used to be that you fought for every Powe Node you got. Shops are alot more complecated as well, there are fancy versions of each weapons with Pros and Cons that make it a bit confusing, there are also various suits that do that as well. This game is truely amazing. Worth every penny. I got about 9 hours off my successfull playthrough. The anoying thing is Isaacs PTSD or whatever he has. He's loony. But so am I.

												Dead Space returned us to what a proper horror game should be, the second entry takes the game more into the action. it also explores Issac Clarke's (the series protagonist) life and how he fights what the horrors he endures in the first adventure and how it affected his mind. very emotional and had some of the best moments I had in any game recently.I highly recommend this game, and for new comers to the series you should play the first Dead Space before coming to this as it is a continuation of the story, you won't be disappointed.

												Loved Dead Space 1 but this was just a big dissappointment. The game launches with stupid action scene filled with quick time events. Ie. press the prompted buttons quickly or you're dead and get to start over. Combined with the fact that you've just set up all your keys around the keyboard (not quite knowing when or how you need use them) and are not yet totally familiar with them, this is a huge oversight from the game developers. Vigorous mashing of buttons and joysticks is something console games often resort to and I guess EA can't be expected to port their games properly, with consideration. Seriously people, DO NOT TRUST EA. They make games for profit and let down their audience, time after time.The game was a gift to me and I'm sorry I ever added it on my wishlist. But honestly I hated playing it. Did I give the game a fair chance after playing the horribad intro scene for 40 minutes? No. Do I need to? No.			",39,4,1,2,1,0,2

												In Dead Space™ 2, you join Isaac Clarke, the Systems Engineer from Dead Space, as he wakes up three years after the horrific events on the USG Ishimura. The Ishimura was a Planetcracker-class starship besieged by grotesque reanimations of its dead crew, known as “Necromorphs.” After unearthing a strange artifact known as the Marker, Isaac finds himself on the Sprawl, a giant space station in orbit around Saturn. Unable to remember how he got here and plagued with demented visions of his dead girlfriend Nicole, he must survive another nightmarish outbreak of Necromorphs as he fights his way towards an answer he hopes will end all the chaos.

												I do not like this game at all! The statis thing is a bore and seems unneeded. Instead of giving you real world problems you have to do stupid little combos. The first time you encounter the need for this tool is to keep a door from closing due to an electric eye that scans you and makes the door close. You have to use this stacis tool instead of simply shooting out the damn electric eye which would work the same and disable it. Once again you have a dumb♥♥♥♥♥weapon that will blow the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of monsters yet cannot damage simple devices in the surroundings. If you are a game nerd and love to have ridiculous restrictions that require a ONE WAY OR THE HIGHWAY mode then this is for you. If you are wanting to play the game as a time killer for kicks to see monsters then go play Doom 3 which this is clearly a rip off of and the graphics are just as Poor! This game is about as much fun as Jericho which was a rolling piece of crap asmuch as this one. For me I like the idea of it yet it has too many restrictions within the realm of physics to work with! One thing I CANNOT STAND about Steam is that unlike prichasing the game where when you find it blows dog♥♥♥♥♥♥you cannot simply give it to a kid to play that might like this type of limited thinking! One again, if you want to play a game like this just go play Doom 3. Otherwise this is yet another turd in the basket.			",73,1,2,4,0,0,0

												Unless it's free, don't bother.I thought the first game was OK, this is terrible. Not worth the any amount of time or money in my opinion, just read up what happens and save yourself the trouble or better yet buy Serious Sam  3 and get about the about same experience except in first person. Almost every area is swarming with so many enemies you turn into Space Rambo, and spamming stasis fields so much they added (albeit lengthy) automatic recharge to it. By the time you are finished your cramped hands will thank you and you will be glad the awful story is over with. They offer a new game+ mode like the first but just one playthrough was  bad enough I don't want to go through THAT again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My hat is off to the developers and producers. Dead space 2 goes above and beyond the original game in every way. Its atmosphere, scope, storytelling, and user interaction are all flawless. Visceral Games is on fire with this title and i especially give a nod to the team developing the multiplayer experience. great work all around. my only complaint is the difficulty in the game. any gamer capable of keeping a cool head and fire accurately is going to find the default difficulty WAY too easy. The first game suffered from this as well. While its not a major gripe, i feel the lower difficulty takes away from the horror at times. Thankfully the harder settings are ready to go from the start. On a positive note, Visceral did a great job in giving the player a reason to use the collection of weapons they made. In the first Dead Space, the plasma cutter is by far the most powerful weapon and competitive players disregarded the other weapons, selling off other ammo in favor of power nodes and plasma rounds. However, by diversifying enemy types and weaknesses they have given the player viable alternatives which diversifies gameplay and lets the player have a reason to use the otherwise ignored weapons. (which are all very flavorful and very well designed.) great job. definitely a must have. 9/10			",187,35,1,14,13,0,21

												Dead Space 2 starts as a promising survival horror, but ultimately ends up being a generic, mindless shooting gallery, where one ambush is followed by another. The game is littered with closed doors that conveniently open the moment you clear the X number of enemies that spawn on you upon triggering a swarm event.The scariest thing in this game is probably the random noise you hear every now and then, till you realize its made by objects that are glitching in walls. The locations are pretty generic, often consisting of the same rooms and layouts copy-pasted together. Thoughout the story you will often be interrupted by unskippable video transmissions and hallucitations, in during which you are unable to progress due closed doors (which are open the moment everyone is done talking), so if you don't really care about the story or got killed and forced to restart a segment, then it will gets more and more irritating towards the end. The game is roughly 10 hours, and even less if you're playing on lower difficulty or don't look every in every nook and cranny, but despite its relatively short length it overstays its welcome. Get it on a discount or not at all. PROS- Visuals. The lighting in particular is quite impressive - Sound and voice actingCONS- Generic, repetitive shoot-em-up- Unskippable cutscenes and annoying, frequent video transmissions- Predictable jump scares and ambush locations			",608,144,15,60,34,7,68

												It's more linear, it's more cinematic, it wastes more of your time, it destroys the story and the gameplay is poorer. It's generally just worse in every imaginable way.Where before you could wander around a bit and explore each section you are now driven down a straight line with occasional loot chests ""hidden"" behind a short dead end turn. The excellent pacing is gone in favor of shoving cutscenes down your throat every five minutes.The gameplay is faster and more intense, in a system that isn't made for speed. Favoring memorization of enemies that will instakill/bumrush you over any kind of tactics or skill. Jumpscares will now gib you where the first game had the sense not to throw cheap deaths at you that you couldn't avoid.Zero G doesn't work that way, good night.The story contradicts the first game and adds nothing of value. All the way up until the end it is never made clear what is going on and you are left wondering who the villian is and why he is the villian. It fails to understand even simple concepts established in the first game, instead misrepresenting and retconning them as taken at face value.Additionally, the Steam version gives you late game stuff for free right off the bat. Making the game far easier than it needs to be.If Dead Space is Alien, this game most assuredly is Alien 3, complete with butchering of an earlier Earth invasion storyline that would actually have been good.

												Nothing like the first Dead Space experience. This sequel is more action/shooter oriented, most of the survival horror elements present in the first game are lost. Dead space 2 isn't a challenge at all since early in the game once you reach the first store you unlock all weapons and suits (which for me ruined the game completely). You don't have to worry about oxygen anymore since you can just recharge it at oxygen stations (no more air cans in the inventory).Jump scares are nonexistent. The atmosphere isn't as creepy as in the previous game.  Towards the end you get the feeling that EA just rushed through the game in order to give you a boring and upsetting ending.

												Bulls#$%. Fake. Difficulty.I hate it in games. It makes things harder, not by being challenging or clever, but by pulling every cheap, irritating trick possible. Dead space 2 is loaded with the stuff, and it angers me more because I enjoyed the first game so much. Once in a great while, Dead Space 1 would pull something like a monster attacking me just as I left a save point. I'd be startled and think, 'Oh, you goofy guys! Ya got me!'But when something like that happens SO OFTEN in Dead Space 2, I began to EXPECT to be attacked pretty much any time I was asked to concentrate on moving an item, hacking a lock, or repairing a macguffin. It's not scary. It's not even startling anymore. There's just the cringe of anticipation, the monster pops up, you kill it, then get back to the stupid puzzle you gotta solve so you can move onto the next room with another stupid puzzle and another jack-in-the-box monster.Worst of all? The enemies are magic and scouting is useless. Meaning, you can visually verify that a room is empty, and enemies will still spawn in. You can back yourself in a corner, and enemies will somehow spawn behind you. You can come from a room that was completely sealed, and enemies will STILL spawn behind you. To the best of my memory, the first game did not do this. Enemies would jump out at you from hiding spots, but once you killed them off, they didn't keep on reappearing just because the room wasn't finished being difficult.Perfect example: I fought my way through two red rooms that had no less than six enemies spawn in as soon as I turned a corner. Then, at the end of this, there was a LARGE, OPEN, COMPLETELY EMPTY room with a hacking minigame in it. I knew exactly what would happen. Soon as I started the minigame, I was bashed out of it by a gigantic monster that had somehow entered the completely empty room behind me without making a sound.BULLS#$%. FAKE. DIFFICULTY.Maybe if I'd just played DS2 by itself I wouldn't be as disgusted with it. But I just finished DS1 a few days ago and wrote a glowing review. Specifically, I mentioned DS1's immersion. The ship felt like a real ship that existed in physically-possible dimensions. DS2 is simply a long line from start to end. I thought the linearity would just be for the opening chapters until the familiar gameplay kicked in. Nope! Whereas in the first game, each chapter felt like you were accomplishing something, in DS2, all you're doing is scampering around trying to find someone who'll tell you what the hell is going on. It felt for half the game like I was just waiting to get to the part that mattered. And the blatantly-impossible monster spawns further broke any illusion that I was playing in a real world that existed. I wasn't seeing a space station orbiting Saturn: I was seeing a bunch of game devs setting up the next prank-like 'screw you' for the player. I stopped caring about anything that happened and finished the game only to be able to say I didn't quit.Though to be fair, let me list some positives: Graphics are better. The suits look great. The mall and daycare were visually-interesting designs. I loved the part with the drill machine. All of the zero-G sections were great and much-improved from the first game. And, to my pleasant surprise, there is a character who I grew to truly hate over time, and the game eventually let me murder the living daylights out of them. A small moment of catharsis. Nice.Overall though, Dead Space 2 is like any number of bad movie sequels. It tries to be better by throwing more action and danger at the story, but utterly fails to spend time appreciating the subtle things that made the first one work.If one of the best parts of your game is when you basically just replay the original for a few levels, you've screwed up.

The whole game was just an exercise in following the linear map and shooting the limbs off necromorphs. Where its technically an FPS so that's all you might expect, the first installment gave us a story where we had reasons to care and people with more complex personalities, both of which are lacking here.

												This is not nearly as challenging as the first one. It is too easy. Even on higher difficulites on first playthrough. EA messed up by making all the DLC unlock automatically. This eliminates many challenges before the game even starts. Picking up schematics is pointless unless it is for a suit. The higher difficulties DO NOT unlock new suits (so you must play on lower difficulties to unlock the elite suits). The camera is too zoomed in to the character, which makes CQB very difficult when surrounded.			",96,12,0,4,1,0,7

												I enjoyed the first part of the series, but this one was disappointing. The first half of the game was good enough, but after that the game just becomes too repetitive. You start noticing how you are again entering another room which will soon be filled with enemies and you're forced to get rid of 5-10 necromorphs. Towards the end these rooms are more frequent and the number of enemies higher, making the game more of an action game than an atmosphere based horror game. There are also other aspects that break the immersion of a doomed space station with other people and constantly remind you that events are only triggered by your character.This game has some memorable moments and some aspects, like zero gravity, have been refined for a smoother gameplay. Upgrading your gear is also interesting, as upgrade parts are rare and everything cannot be upgraded fully in one playthrough. The gear handling is a bit pointless though, as 90 % of ammunition drops from enemies are for the currently equipped weapons. Because of this you can pretty much choose your favorite weapons and not have to switch gear based on what's available.The sound effects and music also do their job well. The graphics are still pretty nice to watch almost seven years after the game's release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dead Space 2: 5/10 Not RECOMMENDEDDead Space 2 Impressions:This is a nice game and yes it is better then the first... or is it?It does have better graphics, it seems to have better controls... but something is off. It just does not feel as authentic as the first one... and it is (as the first one) highly repetetive... the story is... whatever... not really important... the circumstances are forced...What is cool, are the new Z-gravity controlls, this is a nice addition, that should habe been in the first one.This is a nice game... get it on sale... do not believe the hype... but I will not recommend this.On a side note... Only EA knows how to punish you with free DLC... you get some mighty weapons and armor right from the start FOR FREE because the game comes with some lame DLC pack that includes those. It does not really breake the game, but surely goes against the intended survival aspect and it does make the store window overcrowded with useless items.			",116,29,3,10,2,0,1

												More humans-turned-aliens pop out of walls and yell ""boo"" at you in their language in every other room or so. The gameplay is kind of fun, the story has a few interesting bits but overall is still just as forgettable as the original- not to mention the ending fight is just insultingly stupid. At this point it feels as if they're intentionally holding pieces of the story out for other media [Comics or movies] in order to milk more money out of this. In a confusing turn, they gave you the ability to buy multiple suits and variatons on weapons, which felt like they artifically padded out the list of useless weapons [Can beat the game fine with just Plasma Cutter, I've done it with both games] and suits so they could use them for a bullet point on the back of the box.tl;dr - kind of fun to play, completely fails in every way as a horror and/or story driven game. Probably would be better as a simple survive-the-waves game.			",414,51,10,41,14,5,26

												One of the most ridiculous endings I have seen.  Pushing it way too much over the border I would say.It is much better than the First with the controls and gameplay.  But, the way the game is designed is just to be nerve wrecking for the sake of it.  The deaths are unnecessarily lengthy.  And what is up with this ""Press E"" thing?  That is neither skill nor fun.At the end, you just say that ""Thank god it is over"".  Was it fun? No it was not. I picked this up when it was like 5 bucks but I wish I hadn't.

												I HATE THIS GAME.  I was very patient, and played through to chapter 15 (the last chapter)... despite the occasional spike in difficulty or ridiculous QTE sequence, like the blast from the solar array which is basically trial and error.  I developed a reasonable strategy over the preceeding 14 chapters as the difficulty remained generally even.  Then the last chapter arrived, and the difficulty shoots through the roof.  After spending about 2 hours playing the same sequence over and over, my opinion of the game dropped precipitously, mostly because the designers decided to  introduce an arbitrary mechanic to increase difficulty.  I rage quit and will probably not finish it,  I did enjoy the ambience, sound effects, general story, etc... but unfortunately the last chapter ruined it for me.  Not recommended.

												Well, I decided to purchase this as it was on offer.I've already requested a refund after just 17 minutes!Why you may ask.1. The game defaults to 1024 x 768, not your monitors native resolution.This meant, for me, that the registration menu (which you stupidly have to complete BEFORE you're allowed to change resolution) was only half showing on the screen, meaning I was guessing and hoping that my input was going into the correct box.After struggling with it for over 5 minutes I eventually had it done, only to be told that the email was invalid, so I just skipped it and decided to try the single player, after all I could always reregister later.2. At the start of the single player game you're forced to sit through a video, which you can't skip, of about 3 minutes, not long you might say, but long enough, after my earlier problems, to amke me♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and irritable, another minus point then!3. Eventually, when the game started, the controls were all messed up and constantly rotating, even though I'd reconfigured them before starting, so I got killed and there was nothing I could do about it.4. Restarted and guess what, had to sit through the video again!I didn't bother, I'm not going through all that again to have the same problems.To sum it up, a very frustrating experience and one I have no wish to repeat.You have to ask why the developer forces the game to default to 1024 x 768 instead of your monitors native resolution? I have a 144hz refresh rate monitor and that refresh rate is available via the options menu, which makes it all the more frustrationg and mystifying?There is, quite possibly, a decent game here but I'm not prepared to wade through loads of initial problems, due to shoddy programming, to begin with, then being kicked in the teeth by being forced to sit though a bloody video that I've already seen, through no fault of my own!Buy at your own risk!0 out of 10Shoddy and inexcusable!

												Like the first Dead Space, extremely linear and heavily scripted.  No variation at all in the game play.  You go in a straight line from one point to another.  Achieve your minor fetch quest get attacked by monsters.  Go to the next minor fetch quest, get attacked by monsters and so forth.  Similar to many unimaginative games like this it’s basically a 20 minute game stretched out utilizing insignificant fetch requests.   This game was clearly slapped together quickly to capitalize on the success of the first.  Game play is the same as the first absolutely no extra effort is put into this game.  Even when you get killed and have to replay that scene again the creatures attack from the very same spot, so you know where they are coming from.  The developers don't even bother to try mixing it up, it always the same.  You could almost see the script running in front of your eyes.  You even go back to the original ship from the first game thereby allowing the lazy developers to reuse assets.  Without a doubt, this is one of the laziest games I ever played.  The graphics are minor step up from the first and that's the only thing that has improved.  The character Isaac now speaks and he sounds like he's about 16 years old.  But he still moves like he's an old geezer who filled up his depends.  The shooting mechanics were abysmal in this game.  None of them were consistent in the damage they caused.   For instance a heavily modified Line Gun could kill a creatures at 20ft. away with one blast but requires 3 blasts if they are 5ft in front of you.  Except for the Ripper, I found this inconsistency in most of the weapons.  I found the same problem with Stasis.  The fact that the game even uses a gimmick like stasis, tells me that the developers know it’s an inconsistent shooter.  I don't know how many times a creature was in front of Isaac and nothing would happen none of the weapons would fire.  It was like Isaac was scared stiff and instead of trying to firing he just stood there filling his depends.  The only horror I found in the game was in the extreme linearity and bad controls.  I also think the developers could have better utilized their time by trimming down Isaac’s elaborate death scenes and put that same effort into creating something more practical, let’s say, I dunno, maybe a more original game?In conclusion I can't believe that a game created in 2011 that still uses tank controls on the main character can get such high reviews.  The character can't duck or climb all he can do is go left/right/backward/forward.  There is absolutely no variation in the gameplay whatsoever, it’s excruciatingly linear. This has to be the laziest way to create a game.  But I can only speak for myself and if you thought the original Dead Space was a wonder to behold then you will probably be giddy with joy with this sequel.  Anyone else looking for something more than a Resident Evil wannabe set in space should look elsewhere. ",46,1,1,0,1,0,2

												Just play resident evil 4 instead. This is just that but with an unintenionally stupid story rather than a camp masterpiece that came out 10 years ago yet still is superior. It is so clear that the designers of this played and enjoyed resi 4, but do not understand what made it work. It has the over the shoulder style shooting and closed in enviroments like in resi , but it misses out the other components for it to be complete. In resi 4, you run faster than enemies, so there is always an option to run and regroup. In dead space all enemies run faster than you, so the only choice is to not miss. In resident evil 4, the levels are designed so there is always an escape route, or a ladder to climb, or a place to drop down to. In dead space, there are corridors...and sometimes a table. Thats your level design. Another problem is that there is no personality to anyone in this. Im still not sure if isaac is voiced by nolan north or not, and the xenomorphs are absolutely in no way zombies how dare you make that accusation!? By tedious comparrison, leon had a goofy b movie charm to him and the boss characters were introduced, given plenty of screen time to convey their personality, and as such when the boss fight rolls around it has more intimacy, compared to dead space 2 which just has an alien not zombie thats bigger and has one extra ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t undodgable attack, so they by default are the boss fight i suppose.It may feel silly to just compare this to resident evil 4 but considering how much they clearly wanted to be compared to resident evil 4 (which is like a movie wanting to be judged alongside die hard. not brave. ♥♥♥♥ing suicidal), i cant help it. The combat is fundamentally fun because the sound design is solid and the visuals are great, but if youre looking for any substance, nah.			",71,4,0,6,2,0,2

												If Dead space one was not bad enough port then this one will make you wish you could kill the porters of the game. This is Console game on PC. This is not even remotely a PC game. Pure♥♥♥♥♥♥HUGE MOUSE ACCELERATION!!! HAVE TO use 125 mouse report rate and DPI 200 and all ingame speeds at minimum. and you have to be scoped in AT ALL TIMES!If you use Vsynk your frame rate gets locked to 30 no matter what your monitor is. Or what you set in the ingame settings your monitor to be.DO NOT BUY THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥GAME!Also This game is really good at reminding you that it is a console game and if you even try to do something smart you get punished for it because console peasants have no brainpower to do anything wise and everything wise would make the game easy for you like skipping few bosses cuz you stock piled some stuff by dragging them along with you. This game encourages people to be idiots and do what they are told to do and not what is the best way to do it. AKA the reson why console peasants pay for multiplayer.TO SPOIL THE GAME: The marker apparently exists to make everyone ""whole"" again. AKA kill everything and remake all daed tissue into one big thing. All the tissue on the walls and stuff is human corpses repurposed to make walls. And there are multiple Markers in the world and they are all some big corporations attempts to controll it. Isac feels quilt over hes girlfriends death and he has to let her go by destroying the marker what is trying to kill isac because isac made the one in this game. ""The creatort of the marker must be destroyed"" If you readed this far GG. This game is the reason why we PC gamers do not want ANY of the console exlusives to be ported to PC. They would just be as♥♥♥♥♥♥as this entire franchise is.			",101,6,1,7,6,0,3

												I'm no fan of the Dead Space games. In fact, I detest them. Dead Space 1 was, in a word, boring. Boring to the point that I barely remember anything about it. I remember the turret segments, which should have been awesome, were ruined by the atrocious controls, and I remember the two other people with Isaac being unlikeable jackasses. I haven't played Dead Space 3, and I really don't want to. Now, Dead Space 2 takes a cue from Empire Strikes Back and attempts to be better than the first game, which it manages to both succeed and fail at. The Sprawl is a great location to play through, being far more spacious and varied than the Ishimura, and we get a few glimpses of everyday life on the Sprawl. Isaac himself actually has characterization this time, albeit fairly clichéd, and most of the characters we interact with have different and compelling personalities, especially newcomer Ellie. Ellie and Isaac play off one another in ways that are both hilarious and heartbreaking, and it overall makes for better immersion.Unfortunately, that's all I have to say that's positive. The biggest, most glaring problem is: this game is basically Dead Space 1 with a new paint job and a camper attached. Most of the enemies are copy-pasted from the first game, including the ""elite"" recolors, gameplay is identical, the plot amounts to ""Dead Space 1, but on a space station,"" the wide array of weapons is, again, completely pointless since the plasma cutter is all you really need, Isaac is lead along by a female character who betrays him in sight of the oh-so-special Marker, (two this time!), and the monsters keep jumping out of the exact same ""vent"" (it doesn't actually go anywhere) as the first game. Oh, but wait! Now, there's extra varieties of incredibly obvious panels the monsters could be behind! Yahoo!Now, onto the series' bread and butter; the gore and body horror. They're there and they're certainly creative, but they start losing what edge they might have had when they're in your face (literally) from the start of the game right up to the end. Much of the game's gore allowance was lavishly slapped onto Isaac's numerous death scenes...which you'll likely never see if you play at all competently.In conclusion, Dead Space 1 is boring, Dead Space 2 is better but still boring, and Dead Space 3 doesn't look like it's worth the money spent.

												Dead Space 2 was a pleasant surprise for me. Which is odd considering it is a game all about dismembering nightmarish alien monstrosities in the sci-fi equivalent of a haunted house; pleasant is hardly the adjective I might expect to use. But after the disappointing experience I had with the first game of this franchise, it was a welcome change.The biggest improvement was to what I consider the major failing of the first game: Dead Space 2 is actually a creepy experience. Scary? Well, I might be too jaded for that (and let's face it, the monsters in this series are just too comic book to inspire real terror) but I'll admit some of its scripted sequences did make me jump in my seat (just a little bit, of course). The levels are meticulously designed, with excellent lighting and some good texturing, all of which work together to set the proper mood. And while the story and characters are also still sophomoric it was head and shoulders above the simple fetch-quests by characterless officers of the first game.The gameplay was improved too, leaning more towards pure action run-n-gun and discarding most of the chaff of the survival-horror genre (with the exception of save-points -whose presence I accept since I felt they heightened the tension of the game- and the limited inventory space, which I despised since it was a pointless and tedious bit of micro-management that distracted from the game's otherwise impressive pacing). The AI was a satisfactory mix of predictable and chaotic, interspersed with a handful of the mostly scripted sequences.Oh, there were a few rough edges; some levels overstayed their welcome, for instance and there were a handful of minor bugs but on the whole I can't look too unfavorably at this latest iteration of the Dead Space franchise. Its a good-looking, well-playing game with lots too see, even more to kill and lots of memorable (and often creepy) moments.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dead Space 2 is a science fiction survival horror video game developed by Visceral Games and published by Electronic Arts.Set three years after the events of the first Dead Space, the game follows protagonist Isaac Clarke's fight against a new Necromorph outbreak on the Sprawl, a space station surrounding a shard of Saturn's largest moon, Titan.This game is awsome. It's a game you complete in like I don't know, 6-10 hours , yet it's SO good i got 94 horus on it. I would have more hours if my pc wasn't trash.  The necromorphs are what they should be. They should be abominations that represent pain, obviously they also look like they were once humans.. Atleast some of them. Issac Clarke is the most bad♥♥♥♥♥guy I know. He's been trough everything. Fights. Betrayal. Depression. Hell. The mechanics are also really nice, I just LOVE the part where they catch you and you have to press E. Also love how guns have multiple abilities , and how all of them are very different from each other.rating ?10/10 - Boobie Manbuy it.			",83,10,3,4,9,0,7

												Well, I quite enjoyed that. The monotony of the first game was present for the first few chapters, but after that it got quite interesting, with some very cold moments. I like the changes to zero-gee, and I still like the solidity of the weapons (although I appear to have played some odd version where all the weapons were unlocked from the beginning, which means I'm not entirely sure whether I was playing fair with the xenomorphs - but, you know what, screw them, they get to hide in ducts and stuff like that). The story was a bit muffled although I did note some nice parallels with the first game. So yeah, I'd recommend this.			",329,67,8,17,16,3,24

												This is a very good game.It's not like all other sci-fi shooty shooty bang bang games. This take sci-fi and shooting to a new level. In the first Dead Space I will admit it's brilliant. But in the sequel, you go in to depth of engineer Isaac Clarke and see what is trapped in his cursed memory. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good story and is looking for a good survival game. The game also has a multiplayer which is good, (in my opinion singleplayer is better, I prefer stories to online playing). The story keeps you playing for hours, I have completed it 4 times because it's so good. So if you're looking for a good game, Dead Space 2 is recommended for most.			",88,6,0,8,3,0,4

												Dead Space was a pretty good game in its own right even though the USS Ishimura was essentially the Event Horizon, a ship where nothing could possibly go right for anyone at any time at all.  Titan is a welcome relief, as the outer space shopping mall getting trashed by the demonic and deadly is a fun little aside as you get your insides pulled out by a necromorph.  Issac Clarke's personal torment is ramped up and the dream sequences are all really well done.  Gratuitous, well-programed and even though it's not all that scary, certain moments that caught me off guard were really effective.			",99,15,0,8,6,1,7

												I have played the first one on Xbox 360, and thought this was a very good sequel. Isaac actually has a voice other than grunting in pain in this one, and the weapon/armor modification is much better than the first one. While I played this, I was simultaneously playing Dead Space 3, but was making sure to be further along the game on this one in case some reference pops up. -RATING- 8.75/10 Great game, just not as good as the third. .3.

												Dead Space 2 is the most satisfying sequel i've played since Half-Life 2 happened. Comparatively the two games are quite similar too in terms of how their respective story lines have developed since the events of the first games. To this end, Dead Space 2 is every bit as good as the first game only, bigger, flashier, shinier, more explosive and more intense.Yes, the once faceless and largely mute Issac now drops his mask more than a bride does her dress on her wedding night and speaks to camera during cut scenes a good amount which does start to wear a bit thin but it doesn't do it enough to spoil the game. It does also verge slightly on having too many of the 'tap the button to escape certain peril' but again EA pushed just past the line but not so far as to actually de-tract from it being an awesome game.If you liked the first, you have to play this. If you haven't played the first, buy it, play it and then come back and buy this one!			",141,4,6,3,16,0,18

												THIS IS A GREAT SEQUEL. YOU SHOULD BUY IT.The gameplay starts off by absolutely throwing you right into the thick of things in the most wonderful way possible, then it gradually fades back into Dead Space 1 style gameplay, where things never stop going wrong.Atmosphere is improved, and some areas have actually had a splash of colour added for good effect.It's a little disappointing that all the quicktime events are accomplished by either aiming and firing before something bad happens, or mashing the E key before something equally bad happens... but otherwise they're wonderfully executed. Not too many of them, but not too few either.And of course Dead Space 2 has more than one tip of the hat to events in Dead Space 1. You really get the most out of them if you've played the first game.The team who developed this managed to characterise Isaac Clarke really well with dialogue, so there's no need to be put off by the silent protagonist suddenly gaining a voice.

												Dead Space 2 is an excellent example of how sequel can be much better than the original. It has better story, gameplay is even more satisfactory, there is more action, more enemies, more weapons to choose, more ways to split bodies and also Issac has the voice.Now we know that he has some kind of personality. I can highly recommend this game to every fan of action-based story-driven puzzle platformer survival horror games out there.			",589,183,18,58,47,6,38

												It's cheap. It's fun. It's scary. It plays better than the first one. It has more weapons. It has more suits. It has improved on everything the community wanted, or at least that I wanted. It kept the ability to replay the game and upgrade all your weapons, like the first one. Basically if you were a necromorph and were in the middle of a feast, this game would have to simply be your prey.....simply irresistable. So if you fell in love with the first one, you'll be doing all that again and then some with this one. AND FOR GOD'S SAKE IT'S $15 TODAY ON THE SUMMER SALE YOU IDIOT!			",193,12,7,22,12,1,31

												Dead space 2 is the successor and full body improvement to Dead Space, Both are masterpieces and peak examples of the survival horror genre, toped only by such works as (the) Resident evils and Silent hills. Mechanically the game is brilliant, building on regional hit boxing it one ups and makes the player dismember entire limbs, ligaments and portions of enemy bodies, its character design is absolutely original grotesque and scary, with fine details taken from photographs of real car crash victims, Ontop of that the game is packed with unique yet feasible fictional weapons, from construction and mining utility tools converted into deadly tools of dismemberment to military heavy weapons and amours. Really quite the masterpiece. Packed with lore and explanation for every aspect.			",218,19,1,22,14,1,7

												90% - Welcome Isaac Clarke aboard the Sprawl!Dead Space 2 continues the story of the great horror sci-fi game, Dead Space. As engineer Isaac Clark, the protagonist of the first episode, you'll wake up in a mental sanitarium of the Space Station Sprawl three years after the Ishimura incident and while you awake into the same deadly nightmare you've experienced aboard the planet cracker ship, you'll have to learn what has happened in those missing years and how is it possible that the necromorphs came back after you've eliminated the threat in the past.One of the greatest improvement of Dead Space 2 is that the developers have cured Isaac's sure throat and finally he is capable to speak all over the game. The other greater improvements of the game, other than the great graphics which is finally much more colorful than the graphics of the first, that the game does not have any loading screen at all. The game loads at the beginning and up from that moment you won't see a single loading screen at all. The whole game plays fluid and without any interuption from the beginning to the very end. However not everything is perfect in Dead Space 2. The story is a bit weaker than the storyline of the original Dead Space, some of the twists are predictible at times and the characters are also a bit weaker than the core team of the USG Kellion.While Dead Space 2 is supposed to be a horror game the horror factor is slowly vanishing by time, mostly in the first quarter of the game and you have to realize that the game is more of an action game than a horror. And if you play Dead Space 2 right after the first one, you'll see this right from the beginning as you will have the routine to not be scared, but to eliminate the necromorphs easily with a smile on your face. Especially with the new weapons, which are even better than the unique weapons of the first one. Dead Space 2 is a great game, but in my humble opinion its more of an action game than a horror and unfortunately it is not better than Dead Space. Still it is highly-highly recommended.

												I would have said it would be pretty impossible to beat the original Dead Space in terms of have a brilliantly visualised world with enough variety, thrills and scares. I was wrong. DS2 is an easy contender for best game ever. Where it loses points for familiarity (having played the original a few times) it regains them for the stunning scenery, original storyline, and cutscene animations. Theres enough action to keep die-hard shoot em fans happy but plenty of variety in the little mini sequences (i.e. fling through space)So definitely one of the best games out there. Will score a very healthy 9 our of 10			",105,40,0,14,8,2,25

In this continuation you have more bad boys, bigger enviroments and new weapons to ensure that corridor will never look the same again. Graphics have improved, the engine runs smoother and if you have a controller attached, perfect. Immersive from the start, bar a few things that are ""scripted"" if you screw up, apart from that and if you managed to clear the first game perfectly, you'll love this one just as much.Top notch story, enviroments and kick assery comments from your Engineer of the future. You'll never want to scream in space again. Oh, just make sure you don't hit that glass ther... never mind.8.6 / 10			",233,8,12,16,31,1,42

												Dead Space 2 is a very good game. Despite some nitpicks I think it's developing into a really great series, and definitely worth playing. Two caveats: if you want a challenge play on a higher difficulty than normal; and don't expect to be terrified. Definitely play the first one first, as well; the second one does include a “last time on Dead Space” intro, but the first game is worth experiencing, especially now that it's dropped in price. And DEFINITELY play all the way to the end, because the ending does a great job of both wrapping things up and raising the stakes at the same time.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2011/10/dead-space-2.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												This game is intensely dark in tone. But this has to be the darkest entry in the Dead Space story. Honestly my favorite Dead Space game by far. This game really nails the atmosphere. The enemies are bigger, badder, stronger, and scarier. This is a must play for anyone who loves the sci-fi horror genre.(And theres an issue with this game too. Not major. For some reason the DLC suits and weapons packaged in this. I have no idea why.)			",84,3,0,1,2,0,0

												Where to begin.I LOVE this game.I haven't played the first one ( time of writing review)The game is a little creepy at times and there are a few jump scares ( some obvious, some not )Setting is nice and gloomy ( space station )Weapon customization is simple and not to over extended ( DS3 was imo )I play with music off so i can't say anything of that.Pro'sDescent story.Character for the most part believableArt style and setting are good and nicely worked out.Con'sWish it was a little creepier and scary.This game is good and worth a few bucks, you won't regret picking this up.

												I enjoyed this game.  I stalled out on it for a while, because it got too spooky and I found it difficult to play for extended periods of time because I got tense.  That being said, it wasn't a ding against the game.  The developers did an awesome job with the jump effects (monsters coming out of cielngs or behind)  The sound was awesome, you don't get queues when danger is coming and of course the music is stressful during battles.  There is always some spooky grating or machine noise going.  The story was excellent, it took off from DS1 and leaves it open for a #3.  The graphics were much more detailed while not sluggish at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is even better than the first, which I strongly recommend you play first, just for background on the USG Ishimura, and Systems Engineer Issac Clarke. While being presented as a well rounded third person shooter, the game does not do what other games of the genre do; Lose the plot. This game stays srong for the about eight hours od story, as it throws you through space in a thrill ride worthy of a Ridley Scott film.			",213,49,2,27,20,0,23

												A bigger and better thrill ride overall over Dead Space. Both are worthy of your time, but this one is a bit more refined in the gameplay dept. The scenery, movement, and weaponry is well done and easier to use, plus there are some great setpieces and new mini bosses. Still gives you the creeps but the scares are less terrifying. And only play it in the dark.			",187,56,1,10,5,0,30

												If you've played the first dead space then this one is a must! If you haven't I suggest getting the bundled pack as some of the horror elements might not resonate as strongly with you (I.E the return of the immortal necromorph or the giant necromorph plant in the hallway). This game really capitalizes on the mechanics of the first game and succeeds it fairly well. It has a nice combination of horror and action sequences that make for fluid gameplay and story. Dead space 2 really puts the player in do or die situations by forcing them to remove or shoot off specific parts of enemies so they don't revive. This becomes all the more tricky when surrounded by various enemies as each enemy is unique and MUST be disposed of in a specific way. The story of this one is okay but not great. My only compliant about the game is the last fight which felt like a cope out and was very simplistic compared to the rest of the game. Overall though I give it a 9/10 and recommend it to horror buffs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An action sequel to a horror original.While the first Dead Space brought back the space horror phenomenon established by games like System Shock and Doom 3, this game is less of a terrifying buildup and more of an action-horror game where the scariest thing is having to reload your magazine as a horde of creatures comes wailing at you.The storyline is not as good as the first, the gameplay is the same and the graphics and engine appear to be better, however; I won't say I've done my research on that.If you like Dead Space, pick this up - give it a play through and go on to Dead Space 3.

												Now I can't say that I played this game on the PC, so this won't be a performance review.  However, that being said. I gladly say that this was some of the best time invested into a survival horror game in a long time.  Not once does it let up, from jump scares to just a creepy atmosphere the single player campaign had me coming back more and more to hunt down the several achievements and master each difficulty, and the multiplayer was a surprisingly intense gorefest where two teams of four are pinned against eachother, one team being the humans trying to complete an object, and the other a swarm of necromorphs whos sole goal is to stop the humans in their tracks. However, while the game is very fun that doesn't mean that the core elements are always present.  This is expecially noticed in the single player. While the beginning is loaded with jump scares and an overall sense of dread as ou walk through the dark corridors, the latter isn't as promising. The dark corridors aren't so dark and the overall pace picks up, giving it a more action based feel than that of a survival horror game. I personally loved Dead Space 2, even with it not holding up in certain aspects it was a very polished game with tons of replayability with the strategic multiplayer and intense single player.  I mark this game as my favorite game for that year and one of my favorite games of all time.  Worth a playthrough atleast for any survival horror fan.			",35,0,0,13,0,0,0

Where it was a survival game (and a downright scary one at that) in Dead Space, Dead Space 2 ups the ante by haveing ACTUAL survivors and giving us more information about the marker and Unitology as a whole.

												I originally played this on Xbox 360 before I made the move to PC gaming. I think its actually impossible to be scared by DS2, so long as you played the first game first. In DS1 Isaac never spoke, it made it feel like the NPC's were talking directly to you, the player, it put you fully in his shoes, YOU were the character. For me that was what made the original Dead Space so immersive and so f***ing terrifying - that and the horrifying man in the wall monsters.They threw that out of the window in this one by having Isaac talk, sure it makes sense from a story point of view but it takes you out of his shoes and completely detaches you, makes you an outsider looking in, like any other game.That gripe aside this is still an awesome game, graphically a lot better than the first, hacking up necromorphs and impaling them with their own limbs is still as satisfyingly gruesome, and the stomping has been improved, now instead of one thud at a time you can keep on mashing that stomp until Isaac gets all angry and swears at the gloopy corpse under his feet. Another big improvement over the first is the zero G sections, where in the first game you'd have to slowly jump from point to point, in DS2 you now have full 360 degree flight with reaction thrusters on your suit, and this has been incorporated into some great puzzles involving the stasis module, pipes and fans.It still has its spooky moments and unexpected googlieman surprises but they lack the impact of the first game, and after an hour of playing you'll be completely desensitized to it. Well most of it, that man in the wall monster is back in this one too and he is still f***ing terrifying.Absolutely worth the buy.			",183,17,6,12,6,1,11

												Horror in a haunted house has an escape plan called a door. Even horror on water can lead you to dry land. But in space, if you get out, where can you go? Dead Space 2 exemplifies this despair and pushes the protagonist, Isaac Clarke, to insanity.StoryAfter the events onboard the USG Ishimura, Isaac finds himself in a psyche ward of a space station called the ‘Sprawl’, which is located on Saturn’s moon Titan, a moon famous for its thick atmosphere. After a harrowing introduction, you discover the alien necromorphs from Dead Space have arrived as well as Isaac. You are briefly tutored on the familiar third-person controls and Isaac regains his suit, his mining tools and stasis and kinesis abilities. What proceeds is a terrifying experience that takes you on a journey through Titan station with surprising twists, turns with many horror clichés from the first game subverted and contorted into new styles of horror.The atmosphere is thick with dread at every corner with save points being a god-send. The setting brings new ideas to the formula as Titan station was once a living, working permanent residence for workers and family. Far from the USG Ishimura’s cold steel, functional, workingman’s mining vessel, Titan has schools, shopping centres, churches, apartments, bars, clubs, restaurants all with colours and stylish architecture. Although some of the colour is blood red and still quite fresh. The eerie premise that not too long ago this station was sprawling with civilians is echoed throughout the game.GameplayThe over-the-shoulder perspective bares resemblance to Resident Evil 4 and Gears of War and all HUD is incorporated into the suit via light levels with the menu and inventory screen brought up as a holographic display. Isaac’s movement is slow due to his heavy mining suit but his gravity boots offer stomping abilities that turn necromorph corpses to mush. Instead of upgrading the standard suit, new suits can be purchased with credits at vendors around the station and your rig is upgraded at work benches using nodes. The more expensive suits can provide stronger armour with lighter material to increase Isaac’s flexibility when severing limbs. Removing limbs from necromorphs is still the best way of progressing and available to Isaac’s arsenal is several mining tools that serve well as limb cutters with traditional weapons, formally used by security personal, available on the station.The gameplay of strategic dismemberment is incredibly satisfying and experimenting with combining different tools on different types of necromorphs offers huge variety. Stasis was less relied upon in this game other than coping with bosses and puzzles but when dealing with smaller enemies it was useful to have kinesis to fire objects in order to preserve ammo. On the Zealot difficulty ammo is very scarce and precision and tactics are required at every step. Zealot is the difficulty to play on but playing on the Hardcore setting limits you to only 3 saves throughout the game if you are a crazy enthusiast who wants to be punished. New abilities include Isaac’s suit being able to be controlled with short bursts of thrust in zero gravity zones inside and outside the station. This made the zero-G zones a joy rather than the frustrating surface to surface thrust jumps in Dead Space.Being sucked out of space is a constant hazard that can also be a risk/reward. When there is a lookout window in an area, the glass can be shot out to suck all occupants, including you, out of the room but if Isaac is quick enough he can shoot an emergency shut down switch that raises a blast door. But leave it too late and the blast door will chop you in half. In fact, Isaac is subject to some of the most brutal death scenes in any game. The huge variety of deaths is staggering and the violence is fantastically visceral. Perhaps that’s why Visceral Games renamed themselves from EA Redwood Shores after the first game.TechnicalSound and lighting were Dead Space 2’s biggest technical achievements. The sound of Isaac screaming or shrills of a Stalker charging or even the electronic noises of walking near ammo, doors and recharging stasis is embedded into my mind and I can still hear them now. Isaac’s heavy boots on metal grating echoes through the station and the pulsating movement of machinery surges through the headphones. The zero-G sections also cleverly avoid sound with only the vibrations of shooting and jumping reverberating through Isaac’s suit further emphasizing the hostility of space. The lighting uses a terrifying blend of darkness and flashing bright lights and also soft candlelight and it’s some of the best lighting I’ve ever seen. The framerate is solid, the art design is stunning, the textures are crisp but due to the layout of the suit’s menus, it’s recommended to use an Xbox 360 controller.VerdictDead Space 2 is a sick, twisted, frightening experience that oozes tension due to its fantastic lighting, sound and satisfying gameplay.90%			",140,9,5,4,2,0,2

												Isaac has lost his mind after what he experienced on the Ishimura, and some have taken an interested in this lost mind.This time around, Isaac feels like an actual person because of his dialogue and interaction with others.Old enemies types return, new enemies arrive, and combat is still chaotic as hell.Resources seem moderate at first, then slowly dwindle as challenges peak.The graphics are worth screenshots at times, especially to catch that great glimpse of shocking gore.Stressful situations and paranoia will make you jump, so get comfy and turn off the lights.Sounds emphesizing an attack, guttural voices and monster yells, all make for a terrifying experience.The game does not feel short but can be beaten in about 10 hours on the first play through.A great sequel to the series that's just as good as the first.If you are a fan of horror action then this game is perfect!Certain weapons feel worthless, but there is a possibility that they may have value if fully upgraded.

												Having played the Demo for 360 a number of times, I decided that when Dead Space 2 came on sale, that it was time to try the full game out. Now, having played through the entire game, it has entered the select roster of my favourite games. As it stands, I would be prepared to pay £40 for this game. Right from the very beginning, the quivering threads of fantastically engineered tension captured me. The fear was vivid, real, and made me feel passionate, engaged and worried about a campaign and characters like I have not done in a long time. The only thing that I can even complain about is that sometimes, when aiming with enemies directly in front of my weapon (behind crosshairs) the shots went through them. However, this affected me roughly twice over about ten hours of solid gameplay. An utterly fantastic campaign. I'd buy it for that alone, forget the multiplayer. 10/10			",21,1,0,3,1,0,1

												Dead Space 2 is a very good game. Despite some nitpicks I think it's developing into a really great series, and definitely worth playing. Two caveats: if you want a challenge play on a higher difficulty than normal; and don't expect to be terrified. Definitely play the first one first, as well; the second one does include a “last time on Dead Space” intro, but the first game is worth experiencing, especially now that it's dropped in price. And DEFINITELY play all the way to the end, because the ending does a great job of both wrapping things up and raising the stakes at the same time.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2011/10/dead-space-2.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												Dead Space was a pretty good game in its own right even though the USS Ishimura was essentially the Event Horizon, a ship where nothing could possibly go right for anyone at any time at all.  Titan is a welcome relief, as the outer space shopping mall getting trashed by the demonic and deadly is a fun little aside as you get your insides pulled out by a necromorph.  Issac Clarke's personal torment is ramped up and the dream sequences are all really well done.  Gratuitous, well-programed and even though it's not all that scary, certain moments that caught me off guard were really effective.			",99,15,0,8,6,1,7

In this continuation you have more bad boys, bigger enviroments and new weapons to ensure that corridor will never look the same again. Graphics have improved, the engine runs smoother and if you have a controller attached, perfect. Immersive from the start, bar a few things that are ""scripted"" if you screw up, apart from that and if you managed to clear the first game perfectly, you'll love this one just as much.Top notch story, enviroments and kick assery comments from your Engineer of the future.

												Well, I quite enjoyed that. The monotony of the first game was present for the first few chapters, but after that it got quite interesting, with some very cold moments. I like the changes to zero-gee, and I still like the solidity of the weapons (although I appear to have played some odd version where all the weapons were unlocked from the beginning, which means I'm not entirely sure whether I was playing fair with the xenomorphs - but, you know what, screw them, they get to hide in ducts and stuff like that). The story was a bit muffled although I did note some nice parallels with the first game. So yeah, I'd recommend this.			",329,67,8,17,16,3,24

												I've finished dead space 1 & 2. So I know the difference between the gameplay. If you played dead space one and like it. The story adds onto it and makes it very interesting til the point you're like ""The .... just happen!?"" Therefore the story is good. The controls in DS1 where ok but the controls in two are much better. Instead of one stomp, you can literally stomp than your hear is satisfied in DS2 and I'll let you know that Issac speaks his mind when stomping. The weapons are better which I suggest upgrading the plasma cutter all the way til you get the bonus; it'll be familiar and your best weapon first time through. I had mines fully upgraded til chapter 7/8 and it made killing necromorphs easier as it added fire to each shot. My second weapon was the line gun. Anyhow good game.I liked the fact that certain items are available from the start (based weapons and suits).I liked stomping my enemies to my hearts desire (Loved the fact that he spoke his mind).Loved the controls (controller is much better).Story has been good since one.Also if you played chapter one and you play this long enough. You might get freaked out later on in the game. I turned it off because I was literally tripping.			",15,3,0,6,8,0,2

												Dead Space 2 é um jogo de cair o cu da bunda de tão tenso que é. O jogo tem um equilíbrio muito bom entre ação e terror, com um ótimo rítmo. Os gráficos são lindos, e os cenários muito bem detalhados. Cada área da estação Sprawl é de um jeito. Você nunca vai encontrar uma área repetida e são raríssimas vezes que você passa pelo mesmo lugar duas vezes, e nunca mais que duas. A história é excelente e te amarra até o final. Tem até um pouco de drama. Isaac Clarke é um excelente protagonista, com personalidade, voz, e isso faz dele um engenheiro mais bad♥♥♥♥♥do universo. To roubando várias opiniões do meu amigo Demolution, que tudo que cantou do jogo é vero e concordo plenamente. JOGUEM. E joguem depois de jogar o Dead Space 1, que também é um♥♥♥♥♥♥jogo de terror.

												A good sequel to the original Dead Space that emphasises combat over the first games more unsettling tone. That's not to say that Dead Space 2 doesn't have it's share of jump scares and tense atmosphere because it does feature one of the greatest chapters in a game since Dead Space. Further expanding upon Isaac Clarkes dealing with the Marker and the Necromorphs revealing answers asked in the original game but also introducing more questions. Imaginitive set pieces and some great enemy design make this a worthy sequel. 8/10			",287,38,7,10,9,2,16

												Dead Space 2 is an excellent example of how sequel can be much better than the original. It has better story, gameplay is even more satisfactory, there is more action, more enemies, more weapons to choose, more ways to split bodies and also Issac has the voice.Now we know that he has some kind of personality. I can highly recommend this game to every fan of action-based story-driven puzzle platformer survival horror games out there.			",589,183,18,58,47,6,38

It has improved on everything the community wanted, or at least that I wanted. It kept the ability to replay the game and upgrade all your weapons, like the first one. Basically if you were a necromorph and were in the middle of a feast, this game would have to simply be your prey.....simply irresistable. So if you fell in love with the first one, you'll be doing all that again and then some with this one. AND FOR GOD'S SAKE IT'S $15 TODAY ON THE SUMMER SALE YOU IDIOT!			",193,12,7,22,12,1,31

												An exciting, dark atmospheric shooter horror game. The game opens with the man who came to free you from an insane asylum ward turning into a Necromorph inches from your face while you're still in a straight jacket...RUN! And survive. The rest of the game you itch your trigger finger plenty, slicing limbs off infected like it's going out of style throughout a sprawling infected city built into an asteroid floating through space while rarely breaking immersion beacuse the HUD is just a hologram built into Isaac's suit. The sleek design is worth stopping to appreciate - although it's not up to Bioshock levels of artistry it is a true step up from almost any other shooter.The 'ghost' of your dead wife haunts you in demensia hallucinations until the very end of the game - when all is revealed.A suggestion - Play as Isaac the Amputator and upgrade the heck out of your basic Plasma Cutter, your first and most trustworthy friend in this infected city.

												A really scary game that brings the frights and thrills that you would expect from the Dead Space series. The story is continued in this one from the first Dead Space. It has a multiplayer which is hard to get into because not alot of people play it online, but from what I did play online, it was alot of fun. The story's great, the graphics and sounds bring you into the story, the overall game is very well done. Issac gets some new suits and new gear to aide him in his battle to destroy the marker, and he picks up some friends along the way.I highly recommend this game to anyone ready for a good fright and an in depth great story. Just make sure to always have your gun ready to fight because monsters come from the most random spots. If you get this you wont regret it!			",3038,1134,139,314,429,33,476

												It is fair to compare this to the first Dead Space.  - Its an action/horror game in the third person.  While the controls feel clunky, they actually work to make you feel as though you cannot control everything, thus making the game a bit more horror than precise control games.  The quality, graphics, and general gameplay are exactly like Deadspace 1 - both games about 7-9 hours each with simple upgrade mechanisms.  The guns themselves are very fun and satisfiying to use.  The cons to this game is that you feel no real sense of progression as each level you sort of.... fall, smash, break, and get stuck into.  You are not mearly on a path, but crash into every level.  The story and phsyco babble is decent and good voice acting.  I recomend it to people who love horror and 3rd person games.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												Если рассматривать Dead Space 2 с точки зрения первой части, где можно было найти, наверное, буквально все ужасы, что могут приключиться с человеком в космосе, то игра их не потеряла. По части сюжета вторая часть не блещет какими-либо крутыми поворотами, напоминает скорее ощущение, какое появляется при просмотре сериала по любимому фильму - то есть дешёвая мелочь. С графикой всё так же великолепно, как и раньше. Однако, лично мне понравился элемент звёздной Романтики, добавленной разработчиками, - когда поднимаешься в стеклянном лифте высоко вверх к солнечным аккумуляторам и видишь из окон Сатурн на весь экран, окружённый Звёздами - завораживает. Моя оценка - ""4"" с учётом звёздной Красоты.			",40,5,0,3,0,0,0

												Back into the labyrinth of space we go for a second time in the sequel of Dead Space and everything looks better, Isaac feels better and the ambience even creeps you out better. This is a game I'd recommend wholeheartedly because it almost does nothing wrong. If I had to attack one thing, it would be that the game didn't take any big chances on changing the gameplay. It's just more refined now, but this game is just to great to pass up. If you've used up Resident Evil and all of its sequel, this franchise will be sure to renew your need to disfigure a scary, threatening enemy in a variety of gruesome yet self-preservative ways.

												The Aliens to Dead Space 1's Alien, this is a much more action-oriented shooter than the first game.  Unfortunately, it pays for this by loosing a lot of the scare factor that permeated the first game, and I think it's weaker for it.  I never felt as vulnerable or challenged as I did in the first.  However, I will say the guns are a lot beefier, the combat is tighter, it doesn't have the visual issues like the stuttering v-sync problem and the zero-g sections are a lot more fun.  And, I will say there is one section in this game that is the creepiest in the whole trilogy.  All in all, it's still a decent game worth picking up on sale, especially since it's as close to a decent Aliens game as you're going to get for awhile.			",986,387,42,147,125,12,216

												If you enjoyed the original Dead Space, you may or may not enjoy this one.  It is the same exact gameplay, but a different location and a few more monsters/guns.  The new location really ruined the fear factor, with it being a huge city instead of a claustrophobic space ship.  The fear factor was also ruined by the main character being introduced more into this one, unlike the original dead space where it gave you the feeling you were that person.Save your 60 bucks and wait for a deal, unless you have a very strong urge to play the next installment of Dead Space.

												Dead Space 2 is a little bit of Resident Evil 4, a little bit of Half-Life 2, a little bit of Doom 3, a little bit of The Thing, a little bit of 2001: A Space Odyssey and a little bit of Left 4 Dead. It's a great game and a lot of fun to play, especially for its scripted sequences, like the ones involving zero gravity and flight, plus the areas in which you get to fight with the Stalkers, the velociraptor-like necromorphs. It has a very cinematic quality, although I wished its story and dialogues had been written better. This game has been made by people who love the horror and sci-fi genre, but it didn't receive the polish that it deserved. You will finish it in about 15 hours, maybe give it a second try in a harder mode, and then never play it again - also because it seems that nobody cares about its multiplayer. But for those 15 hours you're in for some great time.			",55,31,0,5,1,0,10

												Some games give its sequel demanding expectations to meet, and Dead Space is certainly one of them.  In Dead Space 2, the gameplay feels much smoother and the controls are more responsive than in its prequel.  Isaac Clarke has an entire wardrobe of engineering suits now, each having unique bonuses and advantages in combat.  Old weapons are modified and the new weapons bring more excitement into combat.  Some of the new enemies will swarm you in a pack, some will charge at you, and some are just overwhelmingly massive, but all present a fun challenge.  What really amazes me is that Dead Space 2 still managed to maintain an incredible story.  You’ll truly despise some of the characters, but also pray that others survive the necromorph massacre.  The graphics are gorgeous and sometimes breathtaking when venturing in space around Saturn.  If you enjoyed Dead Space 1, then this is a no-brainer.Gameplay: 20/20 … FLAWLESS (One of my best gameplay experiences ever.  Zero-G has never been this much fun.)Story: 10/10 … PERFECT (I truly grew to detest the antagonist and fret over the lives of the protagonists.  This is usually just analyzed in film/literature, but the character development was particularly impressive.)Graphics: 5/5 … PERFECT (Disable V-Sync in-game and force it on from your GPU control panel.  D3D Overrider eliminates micro-stuttering if you’re as picky as I am.)Sound/Music: 5/5 … PERFECTControls: 0/0 … OMITTED (The mouse & keyboard is better than in Dead Space 1, but I still strongly recommend a controller.)Overall: 100% (40/40) … WOW!!!

												Excellent sequel to the original Dead Space, with tighter controls, more elaborate storyline, and an arsenal of weapons and rigs that can't be beat. This game could only get better if it were packaged more like an RPG ala Mass Effect, but as a corridor crawler 3PS horror survival game, it is top notch. Only downside: the multiplayer tacked on and DOA (I wish these developers would at least invest some time in decent bots to let people have fun with the multiplayer; if Gears of War 3 and Black Ops can do it, there's really no excuse for other A list titles not to have that feature).

The good news is you have a new girlfriend that's actually living but she only has one eye. So, what do you do about it? Send her into space...Surprisingly as good as the first game, just make sure you do the hack to turn on full AA because the somewhat improved scenery is worth it.			",58,14,0,7,4,0,1

												Игра стоит внимания и денег. По словам разработчиков, игра реально страшная (а я и не сомневаюсь, особенно когда неожиданно труп встаёт и бросается на тебя, в результате чего нужно быстро жать кнопки). Графика хорошая, красок мало для эффекта темноты. Звуки устрашающие! Сюжет хороший. А сетевая игра подкачала, ибо непонятно, зачем убивать монстров в отдельной комнате, дак ещё управление в сетевой неудобное. Но в целом игра мне понравилась (8,5/10).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands down one of the most frightening games I've played in a long while. I recommend it for a few key reasons: 1) it is the bloodiest game, apart from Gears, that I've played in my lifetime...2) I usually hate horror, but its interesting twist of space faring science fiction and classic almost Resident Evil-esque feel to it kinda gets me on edge... 3) I love the idea of killing monsters with power tools... if you think about it, thats all Issac's ""weapons"" really are. 4) Zero-G!

												This game is basically what I said about the first game, except its ported better and is better designed (one of the best things about it is how player interaction with inventory and waypoints is handled).The story is worse in that everything you do is a lot less purposeful.  Monsters are all resused and basically the same, and the new ones are mostly canon-fodder types .  Even the regenerator re-appears but this time there is no explanation for his re-appearance.The game is... basically more of the same.  Not much to say about it really.  Pretty much expect every horror cliche involving off-screen monsters, long dark halways, and tempting items off to the side (that are totally not obvious monster traps) to come true.The easymode DLC is bundled with the game because of the EA fiasco, so expect to have a clogged up shop screen.

												An incredible game, unfortunately ruined by EA's ""Free DLC"" that breaks the pacing of the game by giving you all the most powerful weapons and armor at word go for free. Ruins the tension and difficulty for absolutely no reason. You can't turn it off, you just have to hunt for the legitimate parts through a menu full of high level equipment to find the stuff you actually have to pay for. Ruins the game.Find it on console and play it without connecting to the internet. That's the only way to play, which I still recommend that you do.			",302,145,4,25,32,3,23

												7 out of 10 The first Dead Space was a fantastic game with great atmosphere, suspense, interesting story and nasty enemies.  The second installment does exactly the same thing for the first 90% of the game.  Then suddenly it tries to be something it was not designed for - be a fast paced action shooter.  This last bit irritated the daylights out of me. The good - First 90% percent of the game is a great follow up to the first Dead Space.  Atmosphere, suspense and intrigue. - Interesting action where head shots don't kill enemies. - The new enemie-types adds an interesting dimension. - Not a game I wanted to play late at night. The bad - I am no fan of the camera style - over-the-shoulder 3d-person.  At least I did not feel like it hindered the game. The ugly - The last 10% of the game is just irritating.  Trying too hard to be a fast-paced action title. - Over the top gruesome death scenes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
