												RAGE seems like a strange lovechild if Fallout made love to Quake in the backseat of a racing car. It is a furiously fast-paced FPS with visceral and brutal combat, while at the same time mixing things up with off-road racing, RPG elements, mini-games and crafting.Sounds an awful lot like Fallout, doesn't it? Well, it's not. Despite many striking similarities, RAGE is entirely its own game. It does all the things Fallout does, but in its own way. If you leave your expectations and comparisons at the door and just play the game for what it is, you will find a competent and diverse FPS that may keep you entertained for a good 10-12 hours.RAGE is a linar post-apocalyptic action game with a twist. It has towns with NPCs, quests, exploration, hidden loot and collectibles, mini-games and even racing tracks.But most of all it is a hectic First Person Shooter, and this is where the game shines. The shooter element is the bread-and-butter of RAGE. It's fast, powerful, intense and it feels good! There are a wide range of weapons to use, each of which has numerous different ammunition types to spice things up even more. Take for example the crossbow; it fires regular steel bolts as one would expect - but swap them out with Dynamite sticks and watch your enemies panic as they realize they have only 3 seconds left to live. Swap in the Mindcontrol bolts and the crossbow turns your enemies into deadly walking bombs under your control!The variety of weapons and ammo has you swapping back and forth between them with glee as you leave wasteland mutants in exploded gibs, charred corpses and decapitated slumps. What is even more striking is how the enemies move. They will pounce at you, climb railings to reach you and leap off of walls. They deftly dodge and weave in zig-zag patterns to make your life as miserable as possible. Their movement is fast, sporadic and unpredictable - and it just looks awesome.When you're not dropping mutants by the dozen, the town offers a nice breather away from the gunfights and gives you the opportunity to pick up side-quests for extra challenges. Race for glory at the local racing track or shop and listening to NPC banter. The mini-games range from strumming banjos, throwing dice or even pitting your deck of special playing cards against NPCs. You can also craft your own specialized ammo, grenades and other useful gadgets with ingredients scavenged on missions or bought from merchants.RAGE also has a few downsides, the most glaring perhaps being the poor and sudden ending. The plot is likewise lack-luster, uninteresting and just overall trivial. More often than not I found myself skipping story conversation because it was so bland I just wanted to go back to shooting stuff.The graphics are a mixed blessing. Generally the sky and landscapes are mindlbowingly beautiful, but many of the up-close scenery looks washed out and blurry, sometimes to the point where you can't even make out what you are even looking at.The sound effects and music is very good. The guns sound punchy and futuristic, and the voice acting is excellent from start to finish. The vehicle sounds are, however, quite bland.Overall I feel that RAGE is a worthwhile game that offers a very solid shooter experience and a fairly mediocre ""everything else."" Definitely worthwhile if you enjoy FPS games and/or wasteland style games.+ Excellent FPS-style gameplay, shooting mutants is a treat+ Great wasteland atmosphere and setting+ Tons of fun guns and ammo to play around with+ Lots of variation; racing, minigames, crafting, collectibles, exploring+ Gorgeous graphics in the landscape/environment/character department+ Excellent voice acting and music, overall good sound design- Muddy and blurry graphics in many interior areas and on up-close objects- The story is uninteresting and lacks engagement- Horrible ending- The game is too easy even on the hardest difficulty- Poor mouse controls when navigating menus and inventory- Engine sounds while driving is pretty weak			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												People can compare Rage to many other games, however it reminds me most of Borderlands with a touch of Fallout and a pinch of Mad Max. However Rage has something new to offer. Yes, it is similar to other games, however what game is not? Rage has a style all its own and really pulls off what they were going for. This is a very grungy game, yet it has times of bright sunny skies and colorful scenes.The story is not heavily detailed but that's alright for the type of game Rage is. It's a FPS that gets to the point and you never feel bored while playing. I thought the story was enough for me to have an idea of what's going on and get me into the action very smoothly. The first few missions give you a better idea of what's going on and flow of the story feels balanced.The gameplay mechanics are very easy to use and to adapt to. Driving is fluid as is walking. The pace of walking is a bit quick, but I like it that way. Be that as it may, I often slowed down my pace to really take note to the detailed environments of the caves, tunnels and dilapidated buildings I scrounged through. The enemies are a joy to fight and have a mind of their own. From scaling the walls to jumping at the last second to dodge your attack, it quickly reminded me of the splicers who walked the ceilings of rapture in Bioshock. This makes it all the more challenging and enjoyable. Lastly, RAGE incorporates some RPG elements to help sooth that part of my gaming palate in the forms of customization, upgrades and side missions. All of that and a vehicle only multi-player tacked on? I believe that's a pretty good package.All in all, I am happy with this purchase and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys shooters with creative atmospheres. I have read mixed reviews about it's length not being what people had hoped (about 10-12 hours) but then again, many of the shooters I have completed were only about 8 hours. With the existence of towns throughout, this will allow me to pace my gameplay and savor the experience without blowing through it a la any other mindless shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A real gem in the rough, While this game has a lot of rough edges and if you do buy it you might want to look up some config or visual modification tools in order to make it work for you the game is well done for the most part. While it may not be as open as some other FPS/RPG games out there it does bring a few good things to the table that others do not have. The enemy models, animations and reaction are very well done, fluid and depending on which faction you're fighting against it might play out differently. NPC interactions are good, and facial animations are very well done making them feel organic at times. The story is a bit rough in places and if you've read anything about this game you will already know that the ending is well not great to say the least. While I do wish there was more to the game then what is offered it was mostly fun while it lasted. The tech in the game world is very nice and refreshing; the in game crafting is rather well done and very quick allowing you to use different items against different enemy types. the ""big picture"" of each scene is mind-blowingly beautiful. This game's canyon vistas are the most intensely gorgeous I've ever seen, and I include Skyrim in that list. Even the interior scenes, with their gross 1990s textures are are composed and lit with an obvious hand-crafted touch. Graphically, it's a ""don't miss the forest for the trees"" kind of situation. Make no mistake though, the art direction and craftsmanship in-game is absolutely phenomenal and despite the blurry textures,If you can buy/find it on sale like I did when I got it, it’s well worth the money, especially once you tinker with the game engine to make it look/run a little better. It’s far better then anything Gearbox has done to date I can honestly say that, it’s not a boring motionless world with singular friendly/peaceful NPCs, however it is no Fallout 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage, a post apocalyptic game developed by Id software (the makers of the Doom series) and running on there tech 5 game engine.I played this game for both Xbox 360 and PC on Steam. I pre-ordered this game when it was available on Steam so I paid $59.99 for it, its now (as of this re-review) $19.99 and the one DLC is $4.99.The game is your traditional FPS shooter game. Its heavily action packed and has lots some cool weapons. I personally found that the shotgun was the best one to use and favored that over all other weapons. There is crafting in the game as well but I find it very simplistic and only of use when you need to make items to break open locked doors, med packs or throwing blades.I did play both the solo campaign the coop and the multiplayer side of the game. I am amazed at how well this game looks and plays and the voice actors used for voicing the game characters. The graphics are also superb and very detailed and amazing to look at both scenery and attacking enemies.The game includes an addon that wasn't originally available unless it was pre-ordered and that's the sewers to explore. When it was released the game wasn't what gamers were hoping it would be, an open world post apocalyptic game as the media coverage lead you to believe. Once you started playing you quickly found it to be a closed world and once you go through a mission area you can't go back and do it over to get any secrets you left behind or want to find. I didn't find this game to offer any replay value in the solo campaign at all. Don't get me wrong the first play through it increasingly good and very enjoyable.The multiplayer side of the game is just a dune buggy race doing lap after lap and shooting at one another with mini guns and rockets. Its like deathmatch but with cars. Nothing new provided here by Id Software in this regard.The says there is Coop play however this can be misleading because you would expect that you can play the campaign with a friend but this isn't the kind of Coop play that Rage offers. Its basically playing objective based missions with a friend.Rage play's very good with the Xbox 360 controller and that is what I use for all my game play and its what I prefer over the traditional keyboard and mouse.Overall the game is totally amazing for my first impression and first play through but severely lacks for replay value. However the multiplayer and Coop play looks as if it was an after thought.In my opinion Id Software dropped the ball on this game or turned a tech demo into a game. Not sure which. This game made Id Software look dated and relying on its old game play style hopping for success. Had the game been an open world type game with the ability to play it cooperatively then it would have been ground breaking.Pro'sAmazing GraphicsVoiced CharactersBladed throwing weaponCon'sClosed worldNo replay valueCoop play is not campaign basedMultiplay is just deathmatch playCVGAnton's Ratingːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː

												I love RAGE up until the point where it suddenly railroads you into a final mission and then ends abruptly. The first half is great - made even better by the Scorchers DLC. The shooting and AI are first class, the environments and character models look incredible even in 2014 and until you get near the end of it you'll be wondering why everyone gets so down on it. But up until then, RAGE ♥♥♥♥in' rules. Also the racing and co-op are surprisingly well made and fun. Find someone to play them with. Also, wingsticks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: RAGE Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: FPS; Action; RPG; Post-Apocalyptic My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 20-45 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWRAGE is an extremely underrated game, and is definitely worth your consideration. It's another game where you find yourself exploring a post-apocalyptic wasteland performing missions for money and trying to survive— then wind up saving the world. In that sense, it feels a bit like a Borderlands game, but with a serious undertone and with realistic-style graphics. When you start to play it, though, you will find it definitely has the FPS experience of an ID game.It isn't an open-world game really in the true sense of the meaning. But it isn't exactly forcing you from one level to the next, either. I personally found the world immersive and the story engaging. The narrative is well written, even if it relies heavily on established clichés. And I thought the graphics were quite nice; very, very nice actually— there was several times I found myself taking a moment to look around at the scenery and grab screenshots. The gorgeous visuals and interesting narrative establish an undeniably captivating presentation.As far as gameplay is concerned: the mechanics and controls were solid, and the combat is exciting.  There is a decent amount of gun and enemy variety, but there definitely could be more. It’s enough to keep you interested, but it is certainly somewhat limited. The desire to explore more beautiful landscapes and to finish the interesting story will keep you intrigued, though, if you find yourself growing bored with the combat in the later stages of the campaign. It is certainly a decently sized game. And there are sidequests and minigames that are pretty fun if you are into achievements and extras.Besides the campaign, there is a coop multiplayer mode where you can clear dungeons with a friend. There are a good number of missions to beat and they tie into the main campaign as little background stories of NPCs and locations. It is quite fun, actually, and adds a very welcome bonus layer of content.Also, there is a racing multiplayer mode (for which I had trouble finding games, to be honest). I was able to find a few games with a low amount of people— but it wasn't living up to its full potential. It matters little in the long run, as the rest of the game is well worth it.And so: if you are looking for a story-driven, atmospheric, and action-packed FPS game with a high standard of quality, you would be wise to give RAGE some consideration.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												I've read so many things about RAGE, how it was a huge disappointment, what kind of a lacklustre game it was. I needed to give it a try and all I can say is that while the game is a lot better than its counterparts in many areas, it lacks some vital things to make the world more vivid.Pros:- Enemy AI is great, they are responding to how you play. If you're going head on with a shotgun in your hands, they try to stay far and shoot you down with AR's or surround you with their greater numbers. If you're playing one shot one kill, they act swiftly and try to mow you down with their athletic skills.- Enemy variety is good. You never find yourself killing the same type of enemy all the time. Even in missions and bandit clans, variety is good.- Town designs are good and based on real world architecture. For example Subway Town is based on Chinese style, Jackal Territory resembles Brazilian Favelas, Dead City is the classic metropolis.- Different accent and characteristics for every bandit clan feels great, a lot better than any other generic bandits in games.- If you play stealthy, there are a lot of times where you can see how bandit clans work, how they are small military dictatorships, ruled by benevolent and paternal figures. Great insight.- Missions are great, especially Dead City is one of the most memorable FPS missions for me.- Caricature NPCs, like J.K Stiles and Dietrich are great. - References in the story, things that are hidden shows that this game was made with passion and the goal was to lead the player to experience the game fully.- Boss fights.- Ammo and weapon variety can make any FPS player wet, but an oldschool LMG could add a lot to the gameplay.Cons:- Sİlent protagonist is a huge no for this kind of game. I've been asleep for years, I should speak, eat, drink, love, hate etc. I need to do things that makes me feel what it's like to be a human again. For example, one of the first missions could be getting in shape something like (Run 20 miles, do some push ups (like in GTA:SA)). The protagonist feels like a mindless robot.- Alienation of the protagonist continues with no personal story. Finding devices that contained data about him should have told who he was, all you get for motivation to play is ""this is this, that is that, now go kill them.""- Secondary missions could use some variety. Assassinate this guy, destroy that thing, drive for this person, try to convince someone, organize resistance, build up defences etc. would be great and very fitting for the personality as he was one of the ""chosen ones"" before the apocalypse. - NPC dialogues are weird. One step and he starts talking, one step to back, he ends talking abruptly.- Towns and settlements should have been more lively, developed according to your actions. For example you do one work for future expansions when you go back you should see that the town has expanded.- More enterable buildings could be better.- Subtitles inside the towns are ♥♥♥♥ed, your dialogues are interrupted with megaphone announcements.- Needed more quests.- Economy is♥♥♥♥♥♥ You do some quest, you earn money and you give it all back to get some ammo and upgrades for the next mission.- Eastern Wasteland is the definition of dull. All gray with nothing interesting to see around.- Last mission, ending of the story was terrible, no decent closure to the story and there was no boss fight. In general it was easier than most of the other missions.- If more sandbox elements were added it could enhance the game incredibly (actually I suspect that they were going for this at one point, but when they were acquired by Bethesda, the plans went to♥♥♥♥♥♥.Seems like RAGE has great potential to build upon and all of the Pros I listed are examples of great mechanics and level design. Only thing that they needed to improve upon is story and open world elements. I, personally, would be more excited about a RAGE 2 than the new DOOM.P.S: People said that they got lots of texture pop-ins that are of course pretty annoying. But for me, with my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop with Intel HD 3000 and 4 GB RAM, it ran like a charm. Even explosions did not cause FPS drops. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is a great game at first. Everything feels unique . The graphics are incredible and the atmosphere stunning. The weapons feel satisfying and the enemy AI responsive. The enemies are not too tough , but not too easy either. The story seems interesting in the beginning too. The driving can be fun and there are options to modify your weapons and vehicles. The world seems big enough for you to explore , which is also pretty nice. The crafting system is simple and useful. Additionally , the mechanics in total feel useful .There are also plenty of mini-games you can play in order to earn some extra cash which are pretty fun. The combat system is similar to most of the shooters today, nothing special , but was made better and more engaging by specific mechanics , like the wingsticks . Overall, the first few hours spent in the game were enjoyable and the game just felt great. After the first few hours of gameplay,however,  the game starts going downhill. The weapons  stop feeling that great and the game starts to repeat itself just to make you feel that it's longer. The missions feel incredibly repetitive and I just felt that the only thing I was doing was to drive from point A to point B and then kill endless waves of enemies.  I also started getting really mad about my character , since I never got to even hear his voice. Even the driving started becoming extremely boring and the challenge had all been lost , since I was never pressed for ammo. There were infinite supplies of everything : grenades , bandages , ammo. The enemies stopped being interesting and handling them was just too easy. I didn't even get to finish the game , since the atmosphere and gameplay became so repetitive that drove me mad! It felt like an endless motive.. Last but not least ,the lack of cutscenes took away the immersion for me as well. It felt like the game lacked something basic , apart from the other. As a conclusion , every aspect of the game was simply ruined by the unneccesary extreme length of the storyline , which caused repetitiveness.To sum up , RAGE is a fun shooter at first , but as you get used to the mechanics and the gameplay  , as well as the story and the mission patterns , it stops being  immersive and throws away the potential.Thanks for reading and I hope that this review has been helpful!

												I kept going hot & cold with Rage to start with, but my perserverence was rewarded when the story line kicked up a gear & suddenly, hours flew by. The whole linear story line holds no issues with me, there's nothing wrong with a single thread-story if it's an immerseive experience.On the one hand, it has the same issue Farcry 2 has; it's side jobs that extend the game time are little repetative at times, popping you out of the experience & it has a typical id trait that means the character feels slightly ponderous in his movement. Not a major thing, but something I need a little game time to adapt to.However, that said, the combat is excellent, the AI engages in tactics that vary from one group or tribe to the next; some use melee weapons, others keep their distance, the Authority uses armour & sheilds. They use grenades, they retreat when you over power a squad, they use cover... It really holds onto you as a player. The mutants, meanwhile, are aggressive, really fast moving & resistant to injury, so you have to be accurate & prepared to retreat yourself. They crawl on any surface so appear out of no where, giving some genuine tension when an NPC tells you to go into mutant-infested locations.Secondly, the little mini-games; trump cards, gambling machines, holographic games to bet on, racing... all make it feel like there are actual communities looking for entertainment & diversions. You're not forced to engage with these, but they do add detail to the 'world'.While the car segments aren't the worst in an FPS, OK at best, it's the FPS part that makes the game. All the weapons have different flaws & strengths, all have various ammo types to play with that give advantages but also have drawbacks. This means you have to use your loadout rather than just use one gun as everything is useful & necessary. Remote control cars with bombs, sentry bots/turrets. emp grenades... all of these can be built using parts found laying around, plus to get a dead characters ammo, you have to 'use' them, all making the player get involved in the game, rather than just shooting anything that moves. As different groups & tribes favour different weapons, you're forced to consider what guns to use depending on who you're fighting.The problem for Rage is that Doom 3 & id's reputation hangs around it's neck a bit, colouring what is a good story driven FPS. Give it a fair chance, put enough time in for the plot to shift up a gear, 5 hours plus at least, & it will reward you. For me, a fully filled-out world is more than just being a sandbox shooter & Rage is an example of that. It's not a top game, but it's pretty good & certainly worth spending time with.

												This is a hell of a game. I remember it getting heavily critizied when it first came out for technical issues, but these have been fixed now, you will need a decent rig to be able to play RAGE on full graphics, understandably though, since it looks absolutely stunning. The game play reminded me very much like Borderlands, lots of different types of weapons, and your vehicle that you can upgrade with different weapons and armour. The there so much content here, just the right amount of side missions to go along with the main story, that makes the flow of the game feel good. There is a few dull moment where you find yourself running from point to point in the cities, but they come part in parcle with this sort of game. Another interesting feature would be the racing, this is done very well, the controls are perfectly carried out, not difficult at all, and it is actually a really nice addition to the game, it gives a nice break between running and gunning. I would really recommend RAGE, there is about thirty hours of content here and you can always get this really cheaply now days.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was definitely fun. But there are a few things that really took away from it.Positive:- The graphics and environments are still amazing, even today.- The AI is incredible. Enemies are dificult enough to keep you awake. Their death animations are realistic, and make you feel like you actually just killed a real human being... yay.- The combat is fun and engaging, though you'll never be pressed for ammo. - The racing is pretty good, even if it's almost impossible to lose.Negative:- Your character is boring. He's silent, and has basically no personality beyond people telling him that he's awesome.- The main antagonists aren't even seen until the second half of the game.- The main antagonists are basically just future Nazis.- The textures take a while to pop in.- The final mission is really really short, and there's no huge boss battle. Just a bunch of easy♥♥♥♥♥enemies that I breezed through with a shotgun.- The ending isn't really explained, and makes no sense at all.I give it a 7/10. Worth at least one playthrough.

												First off, I think this game is awesome, which is made even better by the fact that I got it for free with my graphics card back when it came out.  However, its a VERY mixed bag in terms of quality in various categories.TEXTURES:  Terrible pretty much across the board.  The game engine also mishandles the loading of the textures so that they ""pop in"" if you rotate your view at even a modest speed.  The pop in problem can be minimized via config tweaks, but there isn't much that can be done for the low quality assets themselves.LIGHTING:  Disappointing to say the least.  The vast majority of shadows are baked in and ugly, and the few objects with dynamically-rendered shadows (enemies, cars, etc.) only cast a single shadow from the strongest light source, leading to shadows suddenly shifting when the strongest light source changes.  The particle and distortion effects created by things like torches look great, however.  The only other lighting effects to speak of are some weak HDR and specular maps.GAMEPLAY:  Once you fix the narrow default FOV (+cvaradd g_fov 15 in the launch options), the game is great.  The weapons feel epic and you can carry ludicrous amounts of ammo for them in up to three different flavors (e.g. buckshot, pulse shot, and exploding shells for the shotgun).  The racing side of the game isn't quite as good as the shooting, mostly due to a uniform lack of variety making it something of a chore later on, but everything handles well.  In addition, this game has some of the best animation I have ever seen, particularly the enemy behavior.  They jump off of walls and combat roll in an effort to avoid your fire, and their death animations are wonderfully unique, combining scripted sequence and ragdoll physics seamlessly.  Also, quicksaves!  Every time a PC game omits a manual saving feature, a puppy dies.  Fact.RANDOM STUFF:  The mouse feels janky in the menus, but feels fine in game.  The cursor becomes almost unusable at lower sensitivities.  Also, some areas of the game get blocked off as you progress through the main story, so you'll want to complete any and all side quests you see first thing upon entering a new location.  In addition, the game could do with being a bit more difficult.  The amount of extra money and upgrades that can be found through exploration is either good or awful, depending on how OCD you are.  Lastly, this game has little in the way of replay value or endgame content, as all you can do is run the Mutant Bash arena figher thing or any of the races over and over again.  Each co-op mission is standalone and the multiplayer is racing only.I'd give this game an 8/10 overall, the absolutely incredible old-school inspired gunplay quickly makes you forget that the game looks older than Half-Life 2.  Oh, and don't even bother buying this game without the Scorcher's DLC.  The extra weapons are a riot (nailgun and railgun, the quake classics), it allows you to keep playing after you complete the final mission, so you can backtrack and do any side quests you may have missed, and it grants you access to the Ultra Nightmare difficulty, which is as close to challenging as this game gets.  Thanks for reading!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First and foremost: RAGE is a strikingly beautiful game. Coming from iD, I would expect no less. Since the dawn of the shooter they've been at the forefront of cutting edge technology with a minimum of requirements. With new engine iD Tech 5, they've done it again - this is one of the most beautiful game worlds ever realised. It's staggering the amount of detail that can be seen in this title, from the cliffs and canyons to the exquisite characters. But for all it’s beauty, RAGE is a shooter very much stuck in the past, and while story and character have been beefed up a great deal from past iD products, they just can’t compare with shooters of today. RAGE is wonderful to play, but caring about the game world or having an emotional attachment to any character is a darn sight harder.You awaken in the beginning from a cryo-chamber after many hundreds of years of slumber. The world has mostly been destroyed by an asteroid, and various mutants, bandits and factions now control various parts of this ‘wasteland’. Upon exiting the safe confines of this vault, noting that the other inhabitants have long since deceased, you’re attacked by a mutant and saved by a local. In short time you’re given a gun and you’re told to start shooting. As is the pedigree of this developer, RAGE is a shooter first and foremost.It’s a very traditional shooter as well, corridors and small warehouses rule the day, and enemies jump out from the shadows and behind inaccessible doors. While the game world is at times large, this is more of a playground for vehicular destruction and transportation, getting from one location to another, and can be considered filler. While it has its moments it certainly feels like a part of the world to give it a greater ‘Mad Max’ vibe – there for the sake of being there, and it begins to lose its sheen the longer you play. However, it plays second fiddle to the shooting, and while no one could accuse RAGE of being revolutionary, it’s not held back by its lack of ambition.In fact, because of this, RAGE’s old-school gameplay feels a little fresh, even if it’s playing to its out-dated strengths. The guns, for instance, genuinely feel powerful, and the ragdoll physics really show their strength. Shoot a guy with an arrow, and he’ll stick to a wall. Blast out their legs and they’ll flip over as they’re in full pelt. Shields crack and splatter from impacts, skulls crack open, and generally, the various guns, each with multiple ammo types, feel creative and meaty.In addition, there are many single use items that can be crafted, found or purchased throughout the game world, such as bladed boomerang ‘wingsticks’, gun turrets, spider droids and RC bomb cars, to name a few. Occasionally you may need to be creative, with the enemy A.I being considerably good. They tend to work together, hide behind shield carrying allies, flush you out with bombs, call orders to each other, flank and generally do their best to kill you. Even suicidal mutants will jump back and forth, hop around corridor walls and ceilings, only to backstab you. The various enemies each have their own powers and weapons they favour as well, zig-zagging while they throw screen-darkening clutter at you, ducking and dodging as you’re blasting away. Thankfully, the pacing is spot on, you never feel over-whelmed, and there is always enough challenge.Apart from the shooting, there are odd jobs around towns, such as blowing up bandits cars in certain areas, various race types, delivering timed mail, and even a circus like murder simulation television show where you are literally put into arenas of death. None of it is as compelling as the main quest, but it does help break up the monotony, and helps create the illusion of a living, breathing world. The detail to RAGE is exhaustive, in only the best and most obsessive point possible.This obsession has been carried to some of the most detailed and amazing character models yet seen in any game. Sadly, they’re not all too interesting. Especially when the game attempts to shift gears and provide a sense of tension – I just wasn’t feeling it. The good guy archetype character is boring as hell, the corrupt characters as cliché’d and obvious from the start. Everyone plays their character, but there is no real personality, and there never feels like a compelling villain or even a compelling reason to your character. The world feels like it’s had far too much lavished upon it’s visuals that it’s characters have become secondary.The faceless bandits and “Authority” you fight throughout the game might as well be very detailed stick figures with some great artificial intelligence. Fun to shoot at but why should I care? For all the amazing detail, and terrific character animations, especially by the town folk, they might as well all be playing parts in a stage play. Yet even as I played away, hoping to find a payoff, I was quite disappointed. There is no real satisfying conclusion or encounter, and it felt like I was really only fighting for my own personal entertainment rather than any emotional connection.As of this writing, RAGE has been available for just over two years and it’s more interesting modes have been all but abandoned by gamers. The online multiplayer, once iD’s main claim to fame, is not supported, and the co-op mode, while fun, with a friend I was able to rope in, never felt like a compelling addition, just a very good one. And that really sums up how I feel about RAGE. It’s a game that feels rooted in the developer’s past while having the vision, the visuals, and the environment, to look towards the future. RAGE proves that iD knows how to craft a fun shooter, yet struggles to create compelling characters or even a memorable narrative. Why should I care about the town of Wellspring when I only just entered it? Despite the context, RAGE is still a blast to play. It may not be revolutionary, but its still a finely crafted shooter that is a whole heaping of fun and comes recommended as something a little old-school.8.0/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wish Steam had a ""Meh"" rating, because that's how I felt about Rage.  Not a solid ""No"" but definitely not a ""Yes.""  RAGE is, let's be clear, an old-school shooter.  In spite of slightly open visuals, most of your FPS action occurs in the same general tunnels and limited pathways that Id Software has been doing since Wolfenstein 3D.  Oh, and there's a driving/racing component which is decidedly ""meh.""  The IdTech 5 engine is visually reasonably pretty, but the game is, I gather, pretty poorly optimized to take full advantage of the highest resolution textures.  But to be honest, I don't find the graphics all that amazing, and graphics alone don't sway me without otherwise solid gameplay.The story itself is pretty humdrum stuff, and ends rather abruptly.  I gather we won't be seeing a sequel, at least not any time soon, since Id is busy with Doom 4.  Honestly, it's nothing special.  Post-apocalyptic wasteland controlled by authoritarian regime (very cleverly known as ""The Authority.""  Yeah.).  Plucky rebel faction fights against them and sees you as their possible savior because...aw hell, I forget why.  But whatever.  You're the chosen one.You fight alone through Id corridors using mostly typical weapons (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, etc.).  There's some variation there, but it's all the usual suspects.  The gunplay itself is kind of meh, really.  I found the sound design for the weapons to generally be kind of underwhelming.  They seem to ""clatter"" rather than ""boom,"" if that makes sense.  The wingstick is kinda neat, but limited in ammo.The minigames are generally pretty forgettable.  Gambling stuff, racing, and rhythm games, really.  Nothing special.Honestly, the game plays like an ""also ran"" to Borderlands, but it takes itself much more seriously and lacks any co-op component.  I'd say it's worth not more than $5.  At that rate, it's decently fun to run around and shoot stuff.  But it's a fairly disposable game and even at a $5 price tag, you won't be missing much if you skip it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For all the artistic and technical talent that Id has at its disposal, you'd think that after all these years they'd pick up someone who could write an interesting story. But Rage, like every property Id had created, has a shallow and generic setting, a mere framework for the gameplay it supports. And sadly, the gameplay equally lacks in innovation.That's not to say I didn't have fun; for an action-shooter FPS, the combat could be remarkably tense, thanks to some good AI and an impressive moveset for all the enemies. The NPCs advance, take cover, throw grenades, retreat, and even try to drag their wounded carcasses out of the firefight. The fights were probably the best part of the game, which is all the more odd since the weapons you fight with are so dismayingly underpowered (in fact, the bulk of my kills were with the pistol with which you start the game). I have equally little to say in favor of the mission-based gameplay and even less about the abysmal driving segments, both of which seemed tacked on to show off the open world technology rather than for interesting gameplay.And what about that technology? The graphics engine -IdTech5 - excels in creating large detailed levels with sharp textures; there's no low-res skybox in this game! But it rarely takes advantage of this technology; the outdoor levels are broken apart by narrow canyons so you rarely get a feel for the expansiveness of the world. Worse, this impressive long-range detail comes at a cost to the short; close up, the models are distinctly low-polygon in comparison to those used in other modern games. In many areas, Rage looks decidedly second-class.Throw in a variety of other gaffes - serious technical issues (albeit none that effected me), uninteresting ""mini-games"", unskippable cinematics and a noticeable lack of content - and its not hard to understand why some are calling Rage just another Id tech-demo. It has its moments, but as a complete product it is significantly lacking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun game. There is indeed a lack of variation in the gameplay but it is still strangely enjoyable, probably because they make up for it with the nicely made levels and pretty graphics. Cars are rather boring and not incredibly worth the time, could've been a lot better if they spent more time building on the cars. Overall; good game, pretty graphics, fun gameplay, boring story, boring cars, still fun and maybe wait for a sale to get this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I love all post apocalyptic art.

												+ Beautifully realised game world. When the textures are at their peak they're gorgeous, and this game is a prime example of Post-Processing done right. There is an unbelievable amount of visual fidelity & attention to detail in the game that makes the environments feel seamless, believable and immersive.+ Fantastic animations and voice acting make for lively, genuine characters.+ Great enemy AI - though their banter gets repetitive, they'll duck & weave and take cover to make combat more difficult for you.+ Satisfying gunplay, with weapons that feel like they have some kick on account of good audio mixed with realistic enemy reactions.+ Linear, but with PLENTY of exploration. Don't go in expecting Fallout's expanse or Call of Duty's hand-holding; RAGE sits fairly solidly as a mid-ground between these two ends of the spectrum.+ The driving is actually FUN. Vehicles handle nicely, and I found myself playing all the races out of enjoyment rather than necessity.- Horrible texture pop-in, which detracts greatly from the experience in some areas where flat, mushy Play-Doh surfaces are rampant. No, your eyes aren't blurry... that's just the game's major gaping technical flaw.- Easier difficulty than you'd expect from some of the godfathers of First Person Shooters. I'm usually a normal difficulty kinda guy, but if you have ANY experience with FPS games then ""Normal"" is a vacation and ""Easy"" is just insulting. ""Hard"" feels like the definitive experience, where it's difficult enough that you'll want to experiment with everything in your arsenal, but not SO difficult that you can't rely on the basic pistol to carry you through most situations. Seasoned shooter fans will want to skip right to ""Nightmare"" or ""Ultra-Nightmare"", but even then the veterans and masochists will probably leave unsatisfied.- Boring soundtrack that really doesn't live up to the standard of the sound effects & ambience. It's uninspired, and frankly too loud - I turned it down, but you wouldn't be missing out on much to just turn it off altogether.- Pre-order DLC shenanigans. Generally this isn't an issue because the content isn't worthwhile or players can buy it afterwards, but the Anarchy Edition content is valuable and can only be obtained by hunting down a DLC code for sale or cheating. Throw Pop Rocket ammo in the Double Barrel Shotgun and you have a dual grenade launcher that makes quick work of difficult bosses, and the Fists of Rage & Rat Rod buggy are straight-up statistical improvements over the vanilla versions. The armor essentially combines the game's 3 ""classes"" into one, making your life in the game much easier.On top of my playtime here, I also played on PS3 at release and achieved 100% - I bought it again to experience PC graphics and play The Scorchers.

""Immersive FPS & Road Rampage from ID""Rage was the long anticipated project of ID Software. Some mixture of a decent FPS and a wasteland stockcar racing like in Borderlands. Ofc the racing controls are not the most amazing but it makes quite fun to do some boost jumps and armed car fights. There's also a MP. But it's just concentrated on MonsterBashTV and some car arenas. Unfortunately it's quite laggy.However the end product has breathtaking good graphics, especially the 64bit version if you buy the DLC. Rumors tell the DLC ""The Scorcherer's Job Path"" was once included in the main game and just bought separately to make more money. Bad tongues consider the games as one unique 40GB texture because no stone seems like the other. The skybox looks just amazing. All human characters including the enemies feel pretty vivent and natural in their animations. Otherwise some plants are rendered as awful 2D sprites into the 3D world.  The enemy AI is also brilliant. They act smart and take cover, flee on losses or try to jump on you. The campaign is pretty linear. You will meet several families and communities that you can join after you finished some missions for them. Some new interesting features are a quick weapon menu for 4 weapons, different bullet types, several craftable items like spider turrets and lock grinder, melee weapon wingsticks, defib unit for after death revive (max 3 times). Rage is just an impressive graphics adventure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A semi-open world semi-linear FPS game. You are a survivor of a post-apocalyptic world, battling bandits and mutants at first until you are dragged into a resistance in war with a corrupted army of battle armor soldiers.This game have one linear main quest, and a number of side quests per main event. Each main quest involve you traversing an area like a city, a dungeon, or a tunnel to find something or kill everyone. Backtracking/sidetracking options are very limited, so there is no feeling of repetition at all.Weapon options are padded very nicely. The variety are there and not too overwhelming. Your guns are upgraded progressively, and each have their own pro and cons. Your most basic guns are still very useful near the end of the game when you have access to upgraded ammos. The crafting system is there, but I find myself only crafting a few items and ignore all the rest. The sentry bots are kinda OP though, they are very useful in a fight and their ingredients are cheap and common.There are plenty of mini-games to explore during your main-quest downtime. There's a racing game that is actually pretty good! And there's a collectible card game where the cards are part of the game's collectible items scattered throughout the world. There's an arena for you to kill mutants for money when you just want to kill stuff.Although it is considered an old release now, you will still need a powerful rig to run this game. The graphics are very good even when compared to today's standard. The gameplay itself is good, but the menu controls feels like a bad console port, mouse sensitivity is very inconsistent.For achievement huntersThis DLC is needed for 100% completion.The Scorchers DLCMinimum 2 playthroughs are recommended if you want to collect all the achievements. Single player achievements are all quite doable, and all of the missable achievements are no longer missable after years of patches. Except a few will require some luck and patience if you aren't very good in that mini-game. Multiplayer is dead, 3-player boosting is needed for 100% completion. Also, 2-player coop buddy will be needed for the coop campaign.The ending is kinda disappointing.Other than that, this is a very good game.My score: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pay no mind to the bethesda badge on the box, this is actually an id software game (and it IS in face developed by them). So straight out the door you should immediately remove fallout from your mind, and while you're at it borderlands (although the world is similar). Look at the games id made: Doom, Wolfenstein, and Quake are the ones that come to most minds and should be a great example of what kind of game this isNo, there is no real RPG element to this game. No there is no crazy loot system. No it is not a huge open world (although it is probably the most open world-ish of any id game). No it is not a multithreaded complex story. But then again, did any of id's games have any of that? So please stop thinking it's a bethesda game before you buy it, you'll thank me.So what IS this game then? It's an id game. For its time it had amazing ground breaking graphics (and still looks great to this day). It has very tight and crisp combat with very well done controls, perfect level design, and amazing ai. And when I say amazing ai i mean I put it in my list of games with best ai. It's not mind blowing because of it's complexity and intuition, but because of the variety and character it gives all the enemies.So what's the downside? This game is one of those games where a developer obviously is trying something new to the point where you feel it isn't in their typical style. As a result a lot of the ""fluff"" content and features feel not only mediocre, but also unnecessary. Also because this game does not focus primarily on level design it's not something I see myself going back and playing again and again like I would with the old doom and quake titles.In short I do consider this a great game, but certainly not id's best form. The combat and level design are really at the quality only id was capable of (I say was because id is no longer id), and the new tech that Carmake put in this is pretty awesome. It's a blast and, while short lived overall, it is well worth every penny of the $10 price. It might even make you feel hopeful about the game industry again, you jaded ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is actually really good.The weapons are varied and interesting.  It's primarily a FPS with car racing/destruction in a Mad Max style future.  You progress the story by doing fetch quests.Graphics are still pretty good and the shooting mechanics are satisfying.  I had fun with the wingsticks.As a con, I would say that there are few reverse levels here which is a bit of a cheat.I also had this game on PS3 so maybe double my play time on this.

												If you don't expect what it can't deliver, it's an amazing game.  Stunningly beautiful environment art and great guns with good variety (and I find myself switching all the time).  Good level design.  It's quite a rigid and pretty heavily scripted world but it's beauty never ceases to amaze and the gameplay keeps being fun for a long while.  The driving/racing component is a bit harder to like, I find, but it's still enjoyable.  Story is nothing to rave about and the characters are forgettable, but the setting of the game is so well presented, it never really becomes too much of an issue.  Overall, if you like good old FPS action delivered with a level of fidelity raised by a good margin, Rage is a really solid pick.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

RAGE is like Fallout meets Borderlands, it brings the players a good 20 hours of gameplay a world that you could free roam with assortment of vehicles found in the game, and shoot some enemies with your large arsenal of weapons.Overall the game has good graphics, pleasing environment sounds and in-game soundtrack even better, but what the game lacks is a good storyline, a bit of game lore, more challenging boss fights,and a better multiplayer system.

												Having finished the game I'm conflicted to 100% recommend the game.If we consider a game having a beginning, a middle and an end, then this game has a strong beginning, a heavily declining middle and a completely missing ending.Without spoiling anything of the story:You expect the final to be your last stand, having your strongest weapons at the ready only to find yourself finishing the game via cutscene.Personally, the ending was a letdown and I would consider it a key event which should trigger the finalphase, but it was the end of the game and I doubt we will ever see a fullfilling ending.All in all this game is a ""somewhat"" in every category it represents.An O.K. shooter with utility ammunition or gadgets which you will only ever use once to progress the story.Acceptable graphics once you follow the guide posted on steam to improve the visuals of the game.Weapon upgrading is shallow and only for the base weapons every other weapon stays unmodified and yet more effective than any of the upgraded weapons. (Excpect for the shotgun. Shotgun is god, especially with the alternative ammo.Story starts off somewhat strong but in the end you are the maid for everything; a simple goon that does what he's told.Enemy variety is scarce. They may look different but behave the same. They either charge at you fast with a melee weapon, slow while shooting with heavy ordnance and armor or hiding behind cover and shooting with their forehead exposed for a clean shot.The minigames are there but are neither lucrative nor rewarding.The DLC is available early and awards you with a ""one shot, one kill""-weapon. Noice.In conclusion:It's a borderline OK game, because graphics have to be improved from your side otherwise your experience is kinda ""blurry"".Worth the buy on sale but with an unsatisfying / abrupt ""ending"". You have been warned.PS: The video showing the devs of the game boasting about the features of the game is highly exagerated. Having experienced all listed features it's a meh : an attempt has been made out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I tried to like this game. I really tried. I played it ages ago and got up to Kvasir and then just stopped out of lack of desire to continue. Started fresh with the hope of finishing another game in my library and this time I'm knee deep in Subway Town's missions, but I got to a point where I just can't.The biggest crime this game does is being mediocre. It's a competent shooter with bad design choices, poor and convoluted writing, monotonous unskippable dialogues, bland characters, and even worse animation of said characters. But by far the weakest part of the game are the enemies.What broke the camel's back for me was the god damn Muties. I just... It's so frustrating to have to go through quest after quest that just has these shottie fodder running at you over, and over, and over, and over... Just to end it off predictably fighting a kraken mutie, and then run back through the same path you went in, cause yay boring level design. Bandits atleast have you facing off and picking them off from a distance while some either rush you or hop on a turret. FYI, car sections aren't any different. Once you've done the Wellspring races, and got annoyed by the bandits attacking you on your commute between missions, you're not getting anything new.But even then, there is no variety of gameplay styles. They give you crossbow and a section early on in the game where you have the option to do a somewhat stealth run, LITERALLY tells you to go stealthy, and then tears it away before you barely had a chance to pull the trigger when enemies start showing up with head gear and need two shots to drop. First shot hits, enemy shouts out before you get to lock another bolt in their skull, then you might as well get the shotgun out and go rush face.It's just... Dull.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished my third play through of Rage not because it’s such an awesome game but because it’s a 20 gb installation and I’m going to get my headache’s worth before I finally uninstall it. I actually bought the physical DVD version (free after rebate!) and it was a pain getting it installed and registered with Steam. Those of you who buy the game through Steam shouldn’t have any problems though.I heard that Rage got a lot of flak when it came out because it’s from Bethesda and people thought it would be an HD Fallout game with drivable cars. Instead it’s a mostly linear shooter with some crafting elements and side quests. The graphics really reminded me of Doom 3 (ID Software developed the game) right from the start except with the game taking place mostly in the sunny outdoors.  I suppose it’s technically “open world” but there’s no built in game map, so when you’re cruising in your car you really just follow waypoints. The world’s not that big anyways though. Rage is NOT an RPG, so there is no level up system or skill point system. Instead you rely on your array of weapons and different ammo types to blast your way through. Non-spoiler story synopsis: An asteroid hits the Earth and a bunch of “arks” are seeded around the world to wake up after the catastrophe. You play one of the ark survivors waking up and exploring the post-apocalyptic world. This means mutants, bandits, and high tech “new world order” enemies. Really, the story isn’t very well explained through gameplay. Kind of spoiler: There’s no final boss! You’re just playing along in the last area and after holding off a swarm of enemies the game’s over. I was surprised since I had been hording up ammo and didn’t get to use some of the special ammo I was saving up. In all I think the game took about 12 hours to finish but on this my third run I’m skipping some of the side missions. Like I mentioned earlier, there’s no level ups anyway so I won’t really be missing out on anything but story. Overall I’d give the game a thumbs up. Good graphics, a decent challenge, and pretty cheap nowadays (I think it’s about $5 on sale sometimes). Multi-player is dead though, so factor that into your buying decision. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hidden Gem!Wow, after having this game on my list for a while (I don't even remember when I bought it!), I finally decided I should play this before jumping into the latest DOOM. I was contstantly blown away by the graphics quality on a game from Oct 2011! Thats just over 5 years ago!! Runs smooth as silk - especially when forcing V-sync and Triple Buffering. Please be sure to buy the game now at $10, or on the next special, it is WELL worth it!!! And if you already have it, but put it down, pick it up again and finish it!! I can't believe I left this for so long!! 5 Stars for its time! And an easy 4 stars today! (Running on i7 and GTX 960, max settings)P.s. Scorchers DLC is also a great addition - Extra story playable anytime, and once completing the Wellspring Tunnels(?) you score a Nailgun/Rebar-gun (one shotpin enemies on walls) /RAILGUN (shoot enemies through walls with scope!)P.P.s. Just found this on Community Page - nice 4 min preview of the game. Pity its only 720P, as the graphics are so much better in game!

												I am slightly conflicted when recommending this game. People may enjoy different things out of a game than I do.As per usual with my reviews, I'll take my time to lay out why I recommend this game.I bares noting that I finished the game on the ultimate hardest difficulty, only available to owners of the Scorchers DLC.Rage has a combat system that I regard as fun. Especially in the beginning, assuming you went the hardest difficulty, the game quickly plays the resource game. I was challenged often to use my ammo sparingly, keeping my real good guns for emergencies.Money is on short supply as well, so it becomes a balancing act of fighting and earning money to cover your costs.The really strong weapons, like the shotgun (which remains a solid option throughout the game) will run out of ammo fast if you only use that. Sadly, this balance can be ruined by an exploit. It's a little convoluted, but workable. I tried it and felt I ruined the experience a little bit for myself, having large stocks of ammo now. There was no way I would waste 500 shotgun shells halfway through the story. If you feel honorable enough, you can avoid doing it.The combat itself is enjoyable. The guns feel like they have weight, and rightfully so. Hitting something with the full blast of a shotgun will annihalate a small enemy, and stun normal ones with a second killing them. Using a grenade to stun the really big enemies is a valid tactic to then unload shotgun ammo into them.But if you play on a hard difficulty, you'll not be running and gunning. In fact, much like the enemies, you'll be looking for cover often and peak out to exploit their unfortunate positioning, if any.And if you get shot? Well, the revive mechanic is there to save you, zapping you back to life if it has a charge.This is a good mechanic to balance the cheap lucky shots the enemies sometimes like to dole out.Storywise, the game is solid. It's not the best, but it tries to be comprehensible and cohesive. It feels like a potential that wasn't fully tapped into. This is noticeable in two things. One is the missions, where they objective is little more than progress through area's through, well, shooting and reaching the end. Then make your way back, often using a shortcut.But the worst part is, however, it's ending.Now, I would not skip on buying this game because of it. It's literally the last mission that is completely♥♥♥♥♥♥ You break in a facility, spend a few hallways killing and pushing buttons and then tough out a minor gauntlet. No final boss, nothing to really write home to.Everything before that mission seems fine and as the same quality as the rest of the game. Which makes it even more mindboggling. I cannot fathom why something like this was ended in such a way.It begs the question if it wasn't rushed or something.The same devs made Wolfenstein: The New Order, and I can taste some of the influences. Taking cover, the guns feeling good... But while Wolfenstein was more like a hallway shooter, pushing you forward into levels constantly, Rage has a bit of an open world aspect. Not as vast as you'd hope, but big enough to rummage around and see the sights. However, mission handling and such always happen in cities and such. Even races.Races are moderately enjoyable, and are required to upgrade your vehicle. But all in all, they're not something that ultimately stands out as extremely enjoyable, but a good enough time waster if you feel like trying. The races vary from time trials, racing combat to hunting random checkpoints that appear on the map. The enemy AI, especially in high difficulties, can be a real challenge though. So if you want those achievements, maybe do those on a different difficulty.I found Rage a worthwhile experience. The combat and gameplay, which matters more to me, felt good. Most of the weapons fit archetypes that you should be familiar with, but most of their design fits the theme. Except the shotgun. Damn thing looks like a modern polished weapon in a world of rusty and dusted weapons. It doesn't look high tech either like the late game villain's weapons do. Odd one, that.The exploration and story could have been better, but the atmosphere is very well done. There's lots to do, a few things to gamble in a few games, and tasks to do. The people in the cities don't repeat their lines, and often have interesting things to say. Not to mention that they seem to be all named. As if they were placed by hand.If the positive aspects I've described call to you, then Rage may be a worthwhile experience for you as well. As a game of age, it'll now be more often on sale, so be sure to grab it at your convenience.And if you want a game where the combat also feels just as good, Wolfenstein: The New Order will be the next game I may heartily recommend.

												RAGE is a really fantastic post-apocaliptic world with great narrative. Here you've got a heavy loaded with guns buggy to destroy your enemies and race around.Useful system of creating items allows you to re-new your stuff easily. Some kinds of weapons and different bullets make your game more interesting and creative. You decide how to fight. Be a sniper and attack from afar or just kill'em all hard. This is worth to play...

												It's quite hard to review RAGEI wish steam had more options, it's not really ""Yes"", but it's definitely not ""No"" Graphics: it's not that bad, the sky is uhm... just a ""wallpaper"", a static texture, yeah, they worked hard... some textures are quite embarrassing and sadly it's glitchy too...  overall as I said, it's not pure trash, sometimes looks really nice. Music\Voice acting: nothing impressiveLocations: some locations are really nice, some locations are like ""Ehy I feel too lazy today, I'll just copypaste some random corridors, that's ok ?""Story: what I said about laziness ?  I can imagine what happened in ID's offices:""Ok people, let's add those... uhm groups of people here because of reasons, then this guy will ask you to go there to pick that item because... he... needs it ?! Ok then we'll add a giant in this point, because you know, giants are cool, Well then we can... oh guys it's lunch time, gotta go !"" ""But we have to write the final and..."" ""Nevermind, the final is simple, the protagonist goes somewhere and kills everyone and he saves Rohan, that's all""""Rohan ?"" ""Rohan, Megaton, Narnia, whatever, I'm late, Bye guys"" Gameplay - shooting: it's nice, a bit repetitive but nice. Great potential not really used by ID, again laziness, tons of corridors to clean, just a few different ""encounters"", nice weapons feeling, different ammo for each weapon, a lot of extra items, nice IAGameplay - driving: Ok, it's not awful... it's bad compared to the ""shooting gameplay"" and tbh it's quite useless, maybe with a better implementation...Gameplay - in general: the dialogue system it's pretty bad, invisible walls (you can't jump a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥rock, really ?!), subtitles... ok let's pretend subtitles don't exist, side quests are pretty meh, some minigames are nice, but nothing extraordinary. Overall: tons of defect, sometimes it feels like devs were too tired to take it seriously.RAGE it's a Fallout\Borderlands wannabe, but it fails. The game is good enough to be finished.RAGE could have been a masterpiece, but ID decided to not invest... actions and consequences, RAGE is just ok.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is the perfect example of how a bad launch can irreversibly ruin a game. When the game was first released in 2011, the ""mega textures"" looked great - when it worked. Most of the time, it didn't. That ruined the game for me, and apparently many others as well. Fast forward to 2015. With all the problems patched, Rage runs perfectly. Plus, it looks gorgeous - even by today's standards. In fact, I'd dare say Rage is the best looking FPS game in my opinion (even though The Order: 1886 and Battlefield have more amazing tech, Rage has incredible artistic direction).Pros- Great selection of guns - Guns feel real, weighty and powerful- Incredibly interesting cast of characters- Interesting, varied and intelligent/believable enemies- Amazing graphics, even by 2015 standards- Great level design with varied levels- Fun distrations around town (i.e. the game's hub area), including a surprisingly addictive card game- Good range of difficulty levels- DLC that's actually worth the price! Cons- Given the intersting array of characters, the story really doesn't live up to its potential- WAY too few boss battles- NO RAGE 2!! (Ok this isn't really a con, but we need a Rage 2!)In summary, this is one of the finest FPS games ever made. There isn't an epic story to be told, but if you love to shoot stuff - this is as good as it gets. Old school gunplay (without any modern ""gun carrying limit"" BS) with new school gameplay variety and graphics. Rage is a steal even at full price. If you're a fan of FPS games (or even if you're not), this is one game that needs to be in your collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This isn't a bad game. I would compare the game's story to Blade Runner; They've created an interesting world that you want to see, but the story doesn't take advantage of that world as much as it could. Though, while the story is pretty lackluster and the ending is terrible, it has solid gameplay and level design which makes it worth playing in my opinion.Pros:-Enjoyable gameplay-Good level design-Co-op is fun-Very interesting and detailed worldCons:-Technical issues due to the engine (id tech 5)-The story and characters are pretty lame-The ending is incredibly anti-climactic-Not very difficult, even on the highest difficultyIf you like first-person shooters, you'll probably enjoy this. Just have low expectations for the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From the perspective of a storyteller and lore junkie, RAGE is cause enough to RAGE. It seems to get the recipe right: Post-apocalyptic setting, competent voice acting, guns that are fun to fire, enemies that are fun to dispatch, huge cars with huge guns, and good graphics and sound work. So where it goes wrong?The world is dull. It's about as derivative as post-apocalyptic settings can get and simply boring. None of the characters are particularly memorable (except for Dan Hagar and that's only because he's voiced by John Goodman, whom I adore) and the setting is... To say it's barebones is to be generous. There's very little world building and it offers no cohesion, nothing beneath the wallpaper of pretty graphics and animations. You'd think Apophis' impact would create an unique setting with special mechanics, but as it stands, RAGE could very well stand in for a particularly sunny day in Fallout or a mysterious new Zone of Exclusion in a game based on Roadside Picnic (yes, I could stay STALKER, but that's not a direct adaptation, now is it?).Perhaps the worst offender is the Authority. You are constantly being told how the Authority is bad and evil, but the game never actually shows it beyond a handful of comments about hunting Ark survivors (who usually join them) and their leader doing a Bad Thing by messing with the Ark timers. Oh, and they wear red, black, faux-runes, and their flag is a barely modified Reichskriegsflagge. So, Nazis AFTER APOCALYPSE, fought by a Generic White Military Dude. As derivative and boring as the story is, the gameplay is pretty solid. Scrounging up supplies and crafting stuff to fight enemies more effectively is fun, the alternative ammunition adds variety (well, when it isn't a simple damage multiplier), and the foes you fight offer for a varied experience (with the caveat that they tend to be bullet sponges by the end game). Still, there are far better alternatives on the market. Far Cry comes to mind, which does everything RAGE purports to do, except better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

RAGE is such an amazing game, maybe not story wise but the gameplay, the world, the visuals, the women, it's all good.I enjoyed the game very much, as it is quite similar to games like Borderlands and Half Life when it comes to the plot.It is not the most original(est?) concept there is. You are a survivor from a worldwide apocalypse and you become to hero who saves the day. We've all seen it before. But the story never was the strong point of this game.It's the actual gameplay itself, combat is very satisfying and the game is visually VERY appealing. It also works flawlessly on toasters alike. RAGE isn't really open world either, well I mean, it does have open world aspects to it but I wouldn't consider it to be a true open world game like the other Bethesda titles such as the Elder Scrolls games and Fallout games.But i do like the fact that you are able to interact with almost every NPC there is and can do minigames that mostly consist of gambling. There is also racing and bounty hunting.Keeps the game interesting.. For some time that is. You see, the game itself is quite short.And to make you even more doubtful wether you should buy this game, the ending of this game (NO SPOILERS)is one of the worst I have ever seen. It's like they planned to release a sequel soon after, but never got around to doing so. That and the fact that the plot (story line) is confusing and hard to follow and often makes very little sense, are the only reasons not to buy this game in my opinion. But hey, it's always on sale and full priced at 9.99 USD currently. So i guess the length of the game is justified with the current price tag.There are also bunch of sidequests to do so that the game won't be done in under 10 hours.I would also recommend buying THE SCORCHERS DLCas it lets you continue the game after the original endingand gives you a new side story (quest) that will keep you busy for few hours. Also, as mentoned before, women in this game are extreme appealing to look at. And THE SCORCHERS adds another hottie to your collection.It's a fantastic game ruined by a ending that leaves you feel unsatisfied and gives no real closure, none-the-less i will still recommend it, considering how cheap the game is.

												Mr. Rebounding Health, I want to ask you something.  Are you ashamed at all of how badly you ruin tension, pacing, excitement, difficulty, level design and strategy in video game experiences?  I would have enjoyed RAGE immensely more had you not wiped your feet on the experience.  Okay, sure, the story, characters and ending were bland, but as a game, it's pretty good, and it's a beautifully optimized 10 - 16 hour experience.  The enemies are quite smart and evasive, I got to hold 10 weapons at once with varying ammo types and the baddies responded to where they were hit and were ultimately satisfying to kill.  Hell, even the driving portion of the game was phenomenal, so much so I actually couldn't wait to travel and participate in races.  Then you came in and took away what could have been intense, exciting combat and instead, gave me tunnel vision with how easy and ultimately dull you made the shooting.  Now, thanks to you, I can only half-heartedly recommend RAGE.  Thanks a bunch.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is split in 2.Vanilla Game....great game, although a little on the easy side, even with Ultra Nightmare.  The hardest part of the game were the last 2 DLC levels with the Scorchers.  All in all, very fun game, great graphics, solid performance, and amazing shooting mechanics, as expected from ID.  Minigames are worth spending the time to play, and even though money is abundant, the side quests are fun to accomplish.  Racing mechanics are well done IMO, and i do not use a controller.  8/10Game with Rebalance mod 2.0......Oh my, this is what the game should have been.  It may not be fair to do a review of a game WITH a mod, but considering IMO this is how the game should have been i will include it.  ReMod2.0 makes items more expensive, ammo less powerful, and the regenerating health is GONE.  Engineering items is now essential to survival.  This mod + Ultra Nightmare is tough as nails and i loved every moment of it....9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.I remember hearing and waiting for this game back in '08, Yeah, that's how long I've been waiting for this gameThe new engine is astounding. The textures are amazing, It is very nice to see a new engine and not some re-used or re-updated albeit old engine like Unreal 3.0do not expect this game to be open-worlded in the same sense that Fallout 3 are, The world seems large but you are only confined to small and medium sized areas. As you play, but this game is mostly linear. Once you discover several towns, you can do fast travelOverall: the game feels like playing a Mad Max movie with the elements of Borderlands, Fallout, and Some Metro 2033 elements. But that is not to say that any ideas were stolen or re-used for this game. Rage is its own kind of animal, it is unique and it's got plenty of peculiar styles. The world is believable and immersive.Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game is semi open world its more like 2 maps with dungeons, if that will help You imagine.3. There is no character build, You can't play any other way.4. Choice doesn't matter as You have no choice.5. There is not much to do.6. There are moments when this game is too intense (too many hords)Would I buy it? Yes, but don't expect Fallout or Skyrim.

												Rage is fun to play, it's not a GOTY but it's a good FPS with some RPG elements: crafting, inventory. AI is really great, it's fun to see enemies and your robot(s) follow you, climb, hide, etc.You should totally play it, size can be problematic with slow or limited internet but it's a great experience ;) GraphicsThe graphics are good, but the texture caching is some time (most of time on dual monitor setup) a little ugly, if you see what I mean ... The Mega texture give good decors, but you can see that cars or rocks are paint on the texture (it's flat). Since it's Carmack, you can forget physics for objects: table, chair, some bottles are stick where they are.LengthThe game have a good length I've ~20 hours for the main story and side quest (the only things I haven't done are: little games (boring) and most of races). The last DLC add 2h30 of content, and you can still play after you've finish the main campaign. BTW it isn't a real open world, you can drive around, but you'll encounter many close doors and missions are in a close area each time: sewers, refineries, etc.SizeThe size on my hard drive is: 23814 Mo (with all the DLC: Authority pack, sewers and The Scorchers).

												I bought this on sale, which is the only way I would recommend it to others.The Shooter-bits are GREAT! Enemies run from grenades, react to flanking fire, and retreat. The acrobatic mutants roll and duck under your shots, and while returning fire.Graphics looked great for me. Some people complain about pop-in or sub-60 fps, so your mileage may vary.It's all the other stuff that is not very good - the  MANDATORY driving mini-games. The driving always feels... off. And for an ""open world"" experience, it doesn't feel very open at times. I figured once you knew where Subway Town and Wellspring were, you could drive betweeen the two, but you have to take a blimp. The Wastelands feel cramped (esp. near Subway Town).The abrupt ending is just slapped-on, and left a bad taste in my mouth. I was looking forward to a Big Boss Fight and then... nothing.

												This game is problematic. It's great all-around, but some of the complaints about it are warranted. The design is brilliant, but the execution just isn't quite up to snuff. Blowing off mutant heads is better than ever, and id has really kept up with the times. The gameplay here is completely unique to id. Some of the more blatant errors have to do with the balance of the weapons later on in the game. The machine gun/ironsight/cover play looks like it should work, even into the Gearheads lair, however this is not the case and suddenly you must change your strategy. Up until enemies get armor however, you can effectively just melee through the game if your aim is good enough. I was able to complete normal without purchasing bandages or saving mid-level, first time through the game. More subtle some of the maps don't make cover and terrain visually clear. Obstacles sometimes only come up to your knees, and you can jump over other stuff that's up to your thighs, it's a real pain to have to learn this in the middle of a firefight. Combat is not a place where you want to fool around with a player's ability to flow. Please only player clip for good, not evil.But these problems are far and away the exception, and not the rule. id is the best, this game is really quite good, and visually stunning. The uniqueness of the game far outdoes the slight problems with it. 10/10 would buy againps: this is one of a few fpses released in the last 5 years where the campaign isn't simply a drawn-out multiplayer tutorial. buy now!

												Addition to the review: I notice that a lot of people are saying my review isn't helpful, I am not saying this isn't a good game, in fact I quite enjoyed it when I played it on my 8800GTX, but the game has serious technical issues that hinder many people from playing the game and I have not found a fix that works. I can recommend the game itself because it is a lot of fun, just not on PC due to myself and everyone I know having SERIOUS issues with the game.RAGE... while it is a well done game, it is hindered by game breaking technical issues that they have not fixed and the game came out quite some time ago. If you read through the forums, you will find that a big problem with the game is the way that it caches textures with higher end graphics cards. This causes extreme pop ins for textures that really ruins how good this game looks and destroys your frame rate. This only seems to be an issue with higher end graphics cards. I have experienced this issue on the following cards: Nvidia 280GTX (and two of these in SLI), Nvidia 560 GTX, Nvidia 560 Ti, and the Nvidia 660 Ti. Normally I wouldn't bash on a game for an issue like this but for it to be such a massive and common issue really ruins this game and I can't say I would recommend it to anyone with a higher end rig because of this. Now if you have a lower end rig (ran this without any issues on a Nvidia 8800 GTX), you may be able to run this game without any problems but unfortunately there are no guarantees. I cannot recommend anyone buy this unless they are willing to roll the dice with this broken game. I really hope id Software can step it up after losing John Carmack and fix this engine. Go play it on consoles if you are dying to play it, you can probably get the Anarchy Edition at your local Walmart or EB Games for $20 or less on PS3 or 360.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

OverallWell, it is not a bad game. At least better than most of its era, but do not expect too much from it.It displays to you as a open word free roaming fps with car races, crafting, and a lot of collateral activities, more like mini-games.The game has indeed all of this features, but no one of them is deepened enought in durability e quality.They just put a bunch of different stuff together and developed them enought to make them look long and complex enought to persuade the casual player they are good and many, therefore this game is immense and cool!I bet every Hardcore player noticed that and reacted as I did.So, don't be surprised if you find reviews that describe this game as conceived to be a demo for their graphic engine more than a game itself, or to be an ""introduction"" to post-apocaliptic games for newbies.That was an overall, now let me talk about some details and the reason why i liked or disliked them.-----------------------------------------------------------------------GraphicsAgain, game for casual players therefore worths to spend half of the budget on it.It is really cool indeed, expecially textures of the rocks. The game is plenty of rocks and I really liked the way they look.FPS weaponsThat is actually the main element of the game. If you speed-run it you will spend 90% time shooting and ony 10% in racing and exploring. There is nothing particular here, you got the canonical set of weapons. Only thing is you can craft and find different kind of ammo for some of them. Three or four of them transforms your weapon in a different one. Well, actually this happens mainly with the shotgun, who can become a granade launcher or a laser rifle. Nice feaure, not deepened enought, like everything else.FPS fightsThe game is linear, but if there is something I liked it was the enemies AI. Most of them just run recklessly to you screaming and swinging their weapon, but they attemps to dodge your shoots, with jumps, flips, preventive dodges, almost of the times successfully! It gives you a reason to sharpen your reflexes and don't waste (too much) ammo.CraftingYou have less then twenty recipes in the hole game, including an handful that is an enhanced version of a previous project.Considering you have cod-like health recover, 2 charges of respawns that recharge in a minute or less, and lot of weapons, what makes you think crafting a wingstick (kind of a boomerang) or a bandage is of any need?Also some of them are not balanced. Let me tell you of the auto-turret which enemies will knock over istantly! You can place it and literally count up to three to find the turret on the ground, totally useless.INSTEAD there is the sentry-bot that is definety overpowered! It a spider-like robot with a machinegun that is hard to kill, hard to hit, can even melee attack, follows you like a pet, extremely powerful, efficient, and with perfect aim. You can drop it on the ground an almost make him finish part of levels for you! Oh, it costs as much as the turret.And lastly, the remote controlled explosive car! This is a fun one because enemies will see it immediately and one-shot kill it, no matter the distance. It is also has a short range explosion. 'Nuff said.ExplorationTotally useless. You actually have only a city and the arounds that includes entrances to fps levels, and race tracks. No reason to hang in there. Also, jumping (on feet) is useless: there are barriers everywhere and it is impossibile to try to be in places where you are not supposed to be. I literally counted that only ONE TIME I needed to jump to reach a place.CharactersThis is really a great point for this game! Every character is characterized, on its design, voice, way they talk, and they fight (if enemy). I really like of colourful this game is on this point of view, and even be surpriced of how much an npc can be detailed even if you meet only once.RacingVery simple but fun. Consider races more like kart-games-fashioned destruction derbys.MultiplayerWell, it's dead now, but i remember I played in 2013. It was focused on car races. They were fun, but the ease you unlock all the contents and the total lack of skill of players constantly pushed me to think devs already know it would be dead quickly. I even felt the lack of ambition in making something long-lasting.LongevityI beat the game in around 20 hours, consider it a completionist time. I am not surpriced if I'll hear of some speed-runner that beats the game in 4 hours or less. With my total time of 40 hours (including multiplayer) I think I long passed the expectations on longevity of developers.PlotI should say ""spoilers ahead"" but there is not much story to spoil. Plot is a disaster and you totally realize only when you beat the game.Story: Earth is destroyed by a meteorite (surpriced it was not a nuclear war). You were cryogenized and wake up in this post-apocalypse future. You are saved by a nice tought guy that only for coincidence was in that recondite place you were. There is the Authority who dictates the wolrd (even if it is not true). You join the resistance, then you literally just enter the Authority core base and press some buttons. No final boss fight. No horde of guards to stop you. Not even a red alert situation. Not even a out-field voice of the bad guy that curses you or a call from friends to tell you saved the world. Just that: buttons-cinematic-credits. You have done your job now GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE people have to work, ♥♥♥♥♥♥! That was my impression on ending. Also for 80% of the game you just do what you do because you can, no plot involvement.------------------------------------------------------------------------ConclusionsI bought it for 3,50€ while on sale in 2013. Today its full price is 10€ so it can easily be even cheaper.If you spend as much as I did and don't expect too much, you won't be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember when Rage was a highly anticipated title. The follow up to Doom 3 that was years in the making. When Rage came out the reviews were pretty mediocre. At least for a shooter that took years of development by the guys that mastered the genre.  Nothing really appealed to me about Rage, I'm not the biggest fan of ""open world"" games and the post apocalyptic setting has been done to death. But on a whim I decided to install Rage and a couple hours I was still playing it. Needless to say it a huge surprise this was me.  The good? The game looks amazing (though less so with up close textures) and ran smooth as butter on my OK PC. The gunplay is awesome. Tons of weapons and each has a distinct and satisfying feel. There is tons of stuff to do. Take contracts, race for upgrades, minigames or build things to help you kill stuff. Rage has you covered. The bad? Yes, the abrupt ending is indeed terrible and screams for a sequel (which will probably never come). Apparently the game was designed with a controller in mind because selecting turrets, grenades etc is wonky and not explained to you how to do it (Hold the F1 key, mouse click what you want to use). The racing parts I thought were only OK. Overall though I had a ton of fun with Rage. The $9.99 MSRP is absolutely worth it. A sale makes it an even better value. And definitely get The Scorchers DLC. There you get an actual boss fight at the end which was really well done. Even with its imperfections, Rage gets an 8.5/10 from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You would think with such big names behind it as Bethesda, id Software, and Square Enix, this title would be well worth its playtime in cash; unfortunately this is not the case. While the game-play is about as fun as any other post apocalyptic sandbox and the art is certainly a drawing factor, it is simply not all that fun to play. It is surprising just how quickly I found myself getting annoyed at the ""go fetch this"" quests and overall clunky mechanics behind some of the tasks. The challenge is not apparent on any difficulty and areas that are marked by NPCs warning of the dangers that lie ahead are little more than small scripted events where you fight a dozen enemies one at a time.That is not to say this is a terribly made game though. It delivers a mad max kind of vibe that seems to be trying to pull off some off mix of Elder Scrolls: Oblivion mixed with Borderlands. Quests, while predictable and somewhat unchallenging, offered some form of story progression and content delivery. Side missions like the racing ones featured in this game offer an interesting and fun diversion from the redundant primary mission progression, but were short lived and quickly showed their redundant nature as well.All in all I really wanted to like this game. Everything I experienced within the world Rage presents left me wishing it was good, but like any polished junk, at the end of the day it is still junk. 4/10 Buy at your discretion.

												Gameplay wise I really enjoyed RAGE. Its a nice mix of solid shooter mechanics with racing thrown in. It mixes up the experience and keeps the game feeling interesting throughout. The gunplay really shines here. Standard fair weapons with some uniques, but each with unique ammo types and functions that feel very satisfying to use. The explosive shotgun shell rounds for instance, or the electric bolts for the crossbow to name a few. Gadgets like the wingstick are fun as well. Combat is almost always in small corridors. Larger areas are mainly for travel or vehicle comat. Its not a bad thing but rarely will you ever do your fighting out in the wilds. The racing aspect feels pretty decent. Its got some fun challenges and upgrading your car is fun as well. It mixes the pacing up which I enjoyed. Graphics wise it has a uniuqe look. They use the mega texture technology to have no ""repeating tiling textures"" and for a more unique look. It does look very good, but it it lacks in other areas such as dynamic lighting, decent shadows, and high resolution textures. Still its got a very unique look compared to other games. Now the game is not perfect at all. The story and characters are very poor. The story barely exists at all. Some HUD features are obviously from the console and the game could make much better use of PC options. Standard PC features like mouse smoothing and FOV have to be changed via console or autoexec.cfg files. Really sad in this day we still get this crap from devs. Challenge is another problem. Im not an amazing gamer, but I played on hard and didnt have a hard time with anything except a couple encounters. Still in the end once you get your FOV and mouse set, and are playing the game its a great experience. Very fun simple good old fashion shooting with some racing to spice it up. Really recommend espicially now when its so cheap and is 5 bucks on sale every other month or so.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I finished RAGE two days ago, and I've spent the time since thinking about it. If you've read the other reviews of this title, you'll have seen the most common complaints:- no ending. The game just stops.- no character development- no explanations or justification for what you're doing- no real plot- no ability to resume playing the rest of the game once the main quest line is over- persistent graphics pop-ins- somewhat awkward save interface- very awkward weapon and inventory interfaceMy biggest complaint is that the game is clearly not finished. Playing the game in 2016 and most of the bugs are fixed, but this still leaves the gaping problems in the way the game works. To quote Shigeru Miyamoto, ""a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad"". How I wish that John Carmack and friends had spent a little longer fleshing it out. Then, RAGE might feel like a more viable proposition. As it is, once the game has abruptly ended, you will feel cheated. Cheated that you spent time strategising when no strategy is needed. Cheated that you spent time economising when no economy is needed. Cheating that you spent time improving when no improvement is needed.Save your money, buy a different game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands lite done in a realistic style. Bad:ID tech 5 games work on pc, but inexplicably are not set up to work properly from the start- so you have to apply a fix.Story is pretty minimal and often ridiculous. Not as open or long as Borderlands. Not as long as originally envisioned, feels like the ending could have been better.Good:Scorchers DLC adds a lot with a cool weapon and some variety to the environments. Overall this game is pretty and fun,  and the weapons are cool and do get upgrades and different ammo. Great shooting mechanics, ai gunplay, and the racing / combat racing is fun. Solid shooter, try it on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage has some interesting parts, but the package as a whole is a mess. The color of the world is dreary but every NPC you meet is somewhat cheery and treats you like their best friend. While I love racing games and did not expect realistic vehicle behavior, Rage's MarioCart-like take is off the wall arcade. The power ups add more chaos to the racing that's already silly in comparison to the shooting. Even the shooting isn't all that good. The AI is interesting in that it seems to react to the situation, yet it's still dumb and easy to defeat. Bad missions, bad driving, and a setting that isn't coherent and reminds me that there are other similar games with much better story and tone. There's probably a lot of games that have been and may be $5 on sale that I would take over Rage. The Rocket Rally races are just random nonsense where there's no consequence for dying and bares no relation to the rest of the game. I either end up playing whack-a-mole as enemies pop out from cover or just walk up to them with a shotgun when they are crouched. Mutants you just wait for them to run straight at you.

RAGE: an enjoyable and visually pleasing, Mad Max inspired first person shooter with some Borderland style vehicular action thrown into the mix.The GoodGraphics are on point as is to be expected from Id. NPCs are nicely detailed and there are some awesome vistas but sadly some textures don't look as good from up close. Character animations are amazing.The gunplay feels sharp and controlled. Weapons are interesting and can use different types of ammo. RAGE has an open world feel to it, even though it's essentially a linear shooter. Different areas are connected through a central wasteland that you navigate with your vehicle. Id succeeds in making this game feel big.The BadOne of the downsides is the console influence. There are quite a lot of invisible walls. The health regen system is present to make fights more forgiving (even a resurrection system like Borderlands)  and the game menus are clunky to navigate with your mouse.The racing aspect feels a bit forced and unnecessary and the same can be said about the crafting system. On the other hand, they work fine and give some slight advantages to the player. (Fat Mammas!)There is not a lot of variation in the enemy and monster line up. This creates a certain repetition.

												-Description-Story:The asteroid called 99942 Apophis is on a collision course for Earth and it will hit the planet at August 23, 2029, destroying civilization as we know it. The only hope for humanity to survive this event is to burrow down to ground with these Arks and submerge when the Earth is habitable again.  You are one of those survivors who were selected to enter one of the Arks. You submerge from the ground in the year 2135, only to notice that all your fellow Ark colleagues to be dead from the Ark malfunction and that the Earth has become a savage place, filled with raiders, mutants and things that has a dendency to kill you.The main story is somewhat average. It starts very strongly and keeps you in its grasp, but the ending was a little disappointment and anti-climatic for me. Not only that, but the ending also had a huge cliffhanger.Gameplay:The game is somewhat similar to the Borderline series, mixed with some Fallout's apocalyptic atmosphere. You can scavenge the world for items, which you can then use to build different items, depending what recipes you've discovered.The game has main quest line which you can follow, but there are also several side quests, which offers you money that you can then spend at vendors for items and car parts.Pros:+ Apocalyptic world and locations+ Infranty and vehicle mechanics+ Vendor system+ Crafting system+ Interesting characters+ Strong story, but...Cons:- ...Anti-climatic and gliffhanger ending- Main story is kinda short- Lack of character progression- Stealth gameplay could have been better- Not as challenging as I would have hopedDo I recommend?Yes. It has it's shortcomings, but if you enjoy playing apocalytic games, you'll probably enjoy this one too.Verdict: 8 / 10 - Good game( 1 = do-not-bother game5 = average game10 = must own game)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really, really wanted to love this game but instead I could only like it. Post apocalyptic shooting with vehicles and open world elements from the people that made Quake, sounds fantastic right? That's until you actually start playing. You're dropping into the world with the barest amount of exposition and rescued by John Goodman who within five minutes of meeting you, gives you a gun and asks you to wipe out a gang. Vehicles don't exist beyond mini-games and the odd moments where you need to traverse relatively short distances to mission ""dungeons."" You ultimately join the rag tag group known as ""The Resistance"" who fights against the tyrannical ""Authority"" (honestly guys, hire a writer and come up with better names) in the most cliched manner possible. The game does have it's standouts. The gunplay feels good, the animation is excellent and blowing up other cars is enjoyable. The characters are very well constructed and they make you want to just sit and talk with them but instead are used as one-shot interactions. John Goodman's character disappears after the first hour of the game. The game was unfortunately not everything I wanted it to be but it was still an enjoyable experience.Get it for $5 if you have a rainy weekend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I feel this game is very under-rated and under-appreciated. My first contact with this game was thanks to my local Game store where I picked this up second hand for only £4 (xbox 360) early last year. Within the first 5 minutes of playing I was completely absorbed and I fell in love hard. I've since had to re-purchase the game via Steam for another nostalgic playthrough and I don't regret it one bit. The game is based in the future amongst a wasteland filled with survivors, mutants, monsters and patrol units, not to mention bandit cars. You play a character that has crashed down to the wasteland from an intelligent craft which pre-dates the war. The war that is, that turned the land into wasteland in the first place. With your andvanced Ark technology implants and a funky selection of arsenal, you play through to liberate the wasteland and help the survivors as best as you can. Shotgun, machine gun, cross bow, sniper rifle and grenade launcher are some of the weapons that the character can play with throughout the game. My personal favourite are 'boomsticks', a boomering shaped object with blades that can be thrown to cut through advancing enemy heads with the chance of the stick returning to you for another throw. The story line and game start of very well but honestly I found the middle and ending not to live up to the first half. It was good, it was full of action but I just felt there should have been more, a bigger climax. Still I think it is well worth a play for any fps game fans. Plus it also has bonus games inside such as car racing (and fighting) plus gambling games ie cards, dice, roulette. Also has optional side missions. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

OverviewsighOkay, this was a tough one to rate. I gave it a ""yes"", but hear me out first: It's good if you're expecting DOOM, with a tiny bit of open world that was injected in. If you're actually looking for a game based on it being open world, then this is not the game for you.This is DOOM. With the added freedom of a tiny bit of exploration (though there's not much to discover... at all) and some racing aspects, which was.... fine, let's say.My reasoningLet's just go through the cons first.* Graphics, although nice, were poorly executed (ie. pop-ins)* The ""open world"" isn't much of an open world. At all.* The characters had SO MUCH potential, but they all ended up kind of dull. Like some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 90's caricature, but without much personality.* Story wasn't very interesting, and didn't have much explained.* Without spoiling anything for you, the ending was... well.... it wasn't much of an ending. I was saving up all my best weapons, and then suddenly... the game's over. It did not feel like an ending. No boss fight. The final quest felt like just any other side quest.With that aside, I want to say that, with the exception of that last point, as well as the point about texture pop-ins, those flaws are okay and can be overlooked.. IF you treat the game like DOOM. I played it on nightmare difficulty, and I have to say it was just as fun as DOOM itself. It really was. It also came with a few mini-games which I thought were also terrific. The racing aspect of it is no Need For Speed, but it's still a nice addition, and was enjoyable.So to recap: if you're looking for something like Fallout, turn away now. If you're looking for something like DOOM, however, I highly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best game I've ever played. I played quake for years until I found Rage and now I've played it over 600 hours and I've tried a dozen games and have never found one I like as much as Rage. Too bad they didn't make a Rage 2 because I would of been the first one in line to buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game didnt get great reviews, but i dont feel it deserves all the bad reviews. Its a very fun and fresh game with great graphics and ultra smoothye gameplay. Though in order to fully take advantage of all it has to offer you need to tweaki a few settings, in order to turn on the higher level advanced graphics options.The  car races are where this game shines, the multiplayer begins to feel like Twisted Metal after awhile.

												I snagged this game on sale years ago for me and my nephews but never played it until recently. This is one of those games that was over looked by many; which is a shame as it is a great game! I would say it's a mix of Borderlands and Fallout. +Fun gameplay!+Good car/driving mechanics+Great weapon mechanics+Great graphics-My nephew experienced a bug that required him to go to a previous save to complete a mission; I have not experienced any bugs myself.Definitely worth checking out when it is on sale!*Also; How to get the Anarchy pre-order DLC *Free* (alternative option works great):

												This will get a positive mark for 2 reasons, which are probably only worth it if Rage is on sale.  One and one thing only made this game an absolute blast for me, too bad I didn't discover it until the end of the game after I'd already beaten the game and loaded a save before the last mission to complete all the side quests and Sewers DLC.That one thing is the Dynamite Bolts for the crossbow!  I'll explain at the end.  The game and the world looked pretty good.  The gameplay, guns and quessts were just interesting enough to keep playing, but ultimately I was disappointed.  When Rage first came out, I remember all the commercials and such that kept showing these big epic battles versus these huge nightmarish creatures, and these epic ""fight for your life"" vehicle battles.  But these mechanics either fell flat or were almost non-existant. Overall, the vehicle stuff was boring.  It's easy to max out your vehicle's equipment and armor via the ""racing"" mechanic and once you've done that you are pretty much unstoppable when driving around the wastes.  I resorted to ramming into enemy vehicles while holding the Boost button to make enemy cars explode, just to make it interesting.Worse, is the fact that all those adverts suggesting that the game was littered with epic fights against these huge monsters, was in fact only ONE epic fight against ONE monster at the end of ONE particular quest.  In fact, that quest was the ONLY really fun and cool quest in the entire game as you always find yourself constantly encountering said creature as it lumbers/rampages through the city.  You always seem on the verge of getting caught, noticed, or accidentally killed by its random actions until you finally encounter him at the end and are forced to fight.  The whole atmotsphere and feel of that entire level was absolutely fantastic.  If the developers has made the whole game feel like this quest, I think people would have loved this game.The Problem:  This one quest is maybe halfway into the game.  The final objective that ends the game is downright dull and boring by comparison.  Yes, as everyone says, the end doesn't even feel like the end and is completelyh anti-climatic.    If only the developers had made the end game as exciting as the Epic Monster Quest Battle I talked about in the previous paragraph.Dynamite Bolts!  The one thing that that made me not go ""meh"" over the game, maybe second thing if I include the 1 Epic Monster quest.  I had largely ignored the different bolt types for the crossbow other than the basic one for stealth sniping.  But as I was going through and just completing all the sidequests (don't know why I cared), I got bored using the same guns/ammo over and over.  So to change things up and make things a bit more interesting I swapped to the killing from medium range distance with the dynamite bolts.  This is wherre hilarity insued.  The bolts hit their target and then explode after a few seconds.  It was easy to use them on human npc's because they tend to use cover and shoot from a disance, unlike mutants who charge you causing you explsive damage.  Anyways, I found out that if you use the dynamic bolts, the npc's get scared when hit.  Once they get hit, they yell things like ""Oh No!"" or ""Son of a B----!"" or ""Oh Sh--!""   Most of the time the npcs physically react to the bolt and start running around in a frenzy, or his buddies try to scramble away. Sometimes the individual body parts react to where he was hit.  So hitting a bandit in the arm could make him start flailing the arm wilding around, yelling ""Oh Sh--!"" then explode.  Some times the explosions lead to these ""laugh out load' ragdoll glitches where the npc body would catapult across the map, or smack another npc, knocking him over to act woozy from damage, etc.  After I discovered this, I spent the rest of the night laughing uncontrollably as bad guy after bad guy experienced the horror of my Crossbow of Kaboom! The one Epic quest and Dynamite bolts made this game worth the $4.99 Steam Sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game with a bipolar mix of great ideas and some pretty heavy misses. I'll start off with the good, get into the mixed, then get into the bad. Overall, though, I think it's a great game.So, the game starts off with a pretty epic cinematic of an asteroid hitting earth. You are one of the chosen few to be put into a life-sustaining pod of sorts to be released when it's safe to live again. How lucky! Everyone else in the pod died. Not lucky. In the meantime, civilization has adapted to a post-apocalyptic scenario by survivng in small pockets of the wasteland. Some people mutated, others formed gangs, and others complain about ""the authority"" being a general pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Really, they're called ""the authority."" This is the entire plot of the game.The gameplay is actually great! I had followed this game for about three years before its release, and I soaked up the tidbits that they released of their design philosophy. Carmack really admired Half Life 2's weapons, in that the sound they made gave you a real sense of how powerful they are. I think the weapons are one of the best parts of this game. The shotgun has bass, and it LOOKS beautiful. The crossbow looks like a technological marvel, and the sound portrays silent but deadly. Even the crappy starter pistol portrays ""Yeah, this gun is crap but it'll get the job done for the first few stages."" Also, all of the weapons are fun to use. There aren't many (they all fit neatly on the 0-9 keys), but they're well done.My favorite part of the inventory is a wingstick. It's a bladed tri-tipped boomerang with a target acquisition microchip. You sling it out (like a boomerang) and it'll do its best to locate and subtly track an enemy near your crosshairs when you threw it. Sometimes it'll bounce off walls and still manage to behead an enemy. Sometimes it'll break on the enemy and knock the wind out of them. Sometimes it cuts their head clean off and returns to you, ready to be thrown again. It's the best secondary weapon I've ever used in a video game, in both functionality and fun.Additionally, they spent a lot of time creating a wide range of possible movements for enemies. This means that enemies are, by and large, unpredictable. The same kind of mutant will stagger and roll in one way, while another will duck, jump, roll, and then try to hit me with a stick. Also, they die in different animations. It's not as dramatic as id said (""you won't see the same animation twice"" was really overshooting it) but it's nice detail.Also, the car aspect of the game deserves a lot of praise. It's post-apocalypse, so of course everyone attached rocket launchers to their cars. You get homing rockets, and can explode bandits' cars - and the explosions are beautiful. The cars also handle really well with a controller. To be honest, this game's car sequences could have been an amazing game on their own. You have a regenerating speed boost, you have kneecapper tires, upgradable car armor, multiple cars to pick from, car races (time trial, normal race, rocket combat race, and a neat kind of ""point"" race). The game left me wanting more of the car content.Now, for the mixed...It's clear the devs didn't really know what they wanted this game to be. It's a fun FPS with a really fun driving experience, but the racing aspect kind of gets dropped after an hour of gameplay (at which point driving just gets you to the next FPS objective). Also, it wants to take itself really seriously as a shooter. Stealth? Aww yeah, wingsticks and the crossbow are silent, go ahead and have fun - the game actually explicitly encourages it. Except there have been multiple occasions where I've been sneaking and enemies know the split second an ally silently dies across the room, or enemies in one area KNOW where I am and where I will be coming from even though I'm crouching silently. This is paint-by-the-numbers stealth. You'll stealth where the game wants you to stealth, and even that is kind of half-baked. The crossbow is fun but just not viable unless it's the first enemy in an area, which is a shame.Next, the areas are VIVIDLY beautiful. They've put so much effort into making detailed canyon lighting, ambient graffiti and statues, and just general neat touches that make everything come alive. But everything looks good from a distance. When you get up close, you'll notice the textures have this weird black dot patterning (examples are in my public RAGE screenshots). I'm running a ""great"" (RAGE-rated) Nvidia GPU with the latest drivers. I think it's just an afteraffect of id's grand idea of ""megatextures"" which seems to have been ahead of its time. That's another topic, and I won't get into it - this paragraph pretty much sums up its relevance. There's also massive texture pop-in if you use mouselook, and that's never been resolved. Oh well.Last, but not least, the bad parts of the game...Areas are shockingly linear. You will see slabs of rock that are reasonably sized for jumping. You will see paths in levels that you could reasonably assume you could go down.  Maybe there are a few doors you could force open, or something you could climb if you actually tried. No. The game has ONE path that you will always take, and it's frustrating. The game is about exploration in story, but it's really not in actual gameplay. This is made worse by the fact that they hide collectibles - cute nods to past id games, collectible cards to boost your ego, and crystals meant to be sold for money - off the beaten path. Actually, not so much ""off the beaten path"" but ""on the one path you're allowed, to the side where you have no reason to look."" Again, it's ""exploration by the numbers."" You'll explore the way they want you to. Even in a town, you can't save time by jumping around. You need to walk down the stairs, down that one corridor, down the other stairs - it's like I'm playing a responsible citizen simulator. Let me jump 10 feet over those stairs. Let me jump this 2 ft high wall along the corridor. I need to waste so much time wandering around a town with no guidance, the least you could let me do is save some time.Next, the game will just NOT work on an AMD GPU. On release it worked with terrible performance, and within a few patches (and despite tweaking it as much as I could) the game would NOT run on a mid-level AMD GPU. The game relies on CUDA cores. If you're not playing with an Nvidia GPU, you're going to have a hard time. They never fixed that.Also, the game was sold with the promise of day-one mod support, which was an outright lie. Mod tools were not made public available for (iirc) three years after the game's launch. If there was day-one support, as promised and advertised, the community could have done some wonderful things here. As it stands, it seems that most people have just moved on from this game, and that's honestly a shame. Based on the footage they released, the mod tools looked great.The last gripe I have with this game is the multiplayer. Let's see. id software...kings of the FPS genre. A FPS game. That means the multiplayer is going to obviously be...half-baked vehicle combat!! Wait, what? There's no kind of TDM or even just campaign co-op (although I think this is undoubtedly best done as a single-player experience). Instead, the game has vehicle combat in circular maps, which is really an odd direction for it to have taken. I know that I praised vehicle gameplay, but this doesn't relate to any kind of racing. It's literally car deathmatch free-for-all, which is enjoyable up to a point, but really just ill-fitting as the only multiplayer offering. There's also co-op in a number of sort of vignettes of game areas stripped of context and filled with tough enemies. That's cool, I guess. There was never really any driving force to try that other than achievements (and even at that, I just gave up on it). The game's multiplayer has been dead since three months after the game's release, so...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now, i just want to start out by saying, the PC port in this game is awful, if you have a console, you should get it there, but if texture rippling doesn't bother you, than let's get started.Rage is a very great breath of fresh air for FPS games, It blends in nice open levels inside the overall world design of the game. You can have up to 4 weapons equipped at times, and they all feel powerful and immensely satisfying, They have complex recoil movements and different weapons are used for different situation. It's FPS aspect is fun, frantic, and intense, though you will be finding yourself covering behind objects a bit too frequently.The Graphics are very well done, the objects and everything looks good in the game, but you may need some help from mods to get rid of the texture rippling.The story is the weakest point of this game, as you play the game, it is backed up by either way too generic characters, or promising ones that you barely get any dialogue from. Even though the world is somewhat decent in size and filled with crowds. It felt rushed and unfinished, and put together at the last second.But, the game is good overall, i never usually put scores on games, but since this review is a bit crazy, i would give it a 7.75/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very generic story nowadays with your character waking up in a post apocalyptic wasteland, going against ""The Authority"". The influence from Fallout and other similar games is readily apparent. However playing this game, as with most ID software games, for the story isn't the point! The weapons are fun, sound good, and I like the different ammo/things you can craft to aid in killing things. Although some of the textures in game can be messy, the facial animations and attention to detail there is quite good. Would recommend this game when it goes on sale with the Scorcher's DLC. For approx $5, great deal for the amount of content. Not the most amazing game, but fun for fans of the FPS genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Interesting; very different theme and setting.  Graphics are really good, however a lot of the dialog is either dumb or lame.  Combat and driving can be pretty challenging if you crank up the difficulty.  Despite my lukewarm statements, I find myself returning to the game repeatedly - there's just something enjoyable (addicting) about the whole package.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: July 15, 2016
												Despite being a game I can recommend, this is a really interesting, nuanced title. A retro offering in more ways than one, it is crucially retro in the way that it is simply not a perfect, uber-polished shooter, and that this becomes a virtue as it delivers a title that stands out from the crowd, has a point of difference and, if one is prepared to compromise somewhat, a real charm.So what do I mean by RAGE being a retro, unpolished title? Well, let's look back to the first half of the 00s. This was a time when, before a relateively select span of companies (EA, Bethesda, etc) begun to dominate the industry, there existed a teir of titles that is somewhat less evident these days. A sort of B-teir, these games were identifyable by their newbie or unknown developers, somewhat strange production objectives, relatively unoptimised or scratchy graphics, etc.Take a look at Operation Flashpoint. Produced by Eastern europeans, the game was by no means a beautiful, watertight package. Don't get me wrong, as I said in my OpFlash 2 review the original Flashpoint was the best title in the whole of the ARMA and Flashpoint series combined, but this game was not perfectly made! Cutscenes and set pieces were all built within the simplistic mission editor engine, the English language script was iffy, models were boxy and only vaguely humanoid, textures were cloudy and the foliage was all just a collection of two-dimensional sprites arrayed rotationally around a Z-axis. Everything looked vaguely amateur, especially when held up against a game like Halo: Comabt Evolved, but as I've been hinting at thus far this was by no means an indictment of the gameplay experience: Operation Flashpoint was an era-defining, industry-leading title in it's own, specialised ways.And while RAGE does take on the look of a AAA title, at least in screenshots, it is in actually a half-baked, simplistic, technologically incomplete offering. It is an experiment for the IDTech 5 engine which, while a success in certain targetted areas, is by no means a holistic gaming experience.So why am I recommending it? Because it is a really fun, lightweight, occasionally stunning and even thrilling title.First of all a word on the graphics. This engine is obviously an intellectual triumph. Famous ID mastermind John Carmack came up with some magic method that allowed game artists to basically do whatever they wanted with a setting at no cost to performance, and the result of these innovations in RAGE is that it is a bloody georgeous game - at least when viewed in stills. Landscapes simply cannot be faulted, nor can the really intelligent way that lighting has been handled: this game can be really breathtaking.The environments, the lighting, even the movements of the characters are all really well done - but it isn't perfect. Character models move in a really expressive way, but the way they distort to accomodate this movement is somehow unrealistic and spoils immersion. Likewise the pace with which you move through environments, and the relatively low attention you are asked to pay to them (it plays like a rail shooter more often than not), prevents you from truly appreciating them and feeling as if you are part of an environment. In sum, and this is a point that highlights the quirkiness of this title: The game looks great, until you're playing it, then the visuals become forgettable until you stumble upon the occasional well-made set view.The gameplay is also pretty simplistic. Intended clearly to be a vehicle-heavy game, there are races and Mad Max-style road battles featuring limited vehicle physics and auto-aim guns. The shooting play is solid - greatly boosted by the elusive movements of your impish enemies which make aiming a really active experience - but repetetive. Missions are short and not too difficult (though occasionally you come up against big bad enemies who can be a real exclamation point) and in general there is a really light touch on the gameplay on the part of the creators (you would have expected more from Bethesda), something which isn't called for, since the gameplay is so clearly lacking something.So, I'll have to meld this hodge-podge review into a coherent final statement: This is a great, lightweight game. Get it when it's on sale. Get it for your weaker laptop to play on international flights. Get it for the fun gameplay, get it for the occasionally stupendous visuals, get it for the very low drain the game will exert on your mental resources. Don't get it if your machine can play Witcher 3, or somesuch, and can afford those games too.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Underrated gem. Yes, the story is full of cliches and isn't very interesting. Yes, the ending is dissapointing. Yes, the textures could have been better. However... It is very fun to play when it comes to shooting stuff - it has that old school touch that makes wielding weapons so satisfying. Combine that with an interesting enemy behaviour and on higher difficulties it can make gunfights rather challenging, yet still enjoyable. I can also say that I did find some joy in racing and driving around.If you can get RAGE for 5$ it's really a no-brainer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Surprisingly brief. It is a great shooter/racer with alot of little mini games you can have fun with from the battle card game you can play to the hand knife roulette type game all the way to the simple guitar memory game. I found crafting and the battle areas also to be quite fun. Ok now for the down side, The game was buggy as hell when I first picked it up but it got less buggy after some graphics card driver updates. I never once met the mysterious general running the bad guys, The last battle was also more of a gauntlet with no actual boss fight to speak of. Kinda left me surprised and disappointed. It actually felt like the game lost funding and so they just ended it with a happy ending cut scene. Do I recommend it? Yes but know what you are getting into and try to get it on sell. Right now it is 4.99 on the summer steam sale and that is a good price for it. Enjoy it while you can and make it drag out as much as you can but it will end. If you want a better game, get Borderlands (any of them), won;t be as visually impressive but will be more fun and complete and less buggy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite the hugely anti-climatic ending that WILL leave you disappointed, Rage is a very under appreciated game, that got a lot of hate due to its crappy PC port on release. Most of the problems it had were fixed, but it still feels like a console game. And playing on PC, that is unacceptable.  If you're able to get past the graphical issues, Rage is a very well made game. Think of Borderlands but without the RPG stuff: that is Rage. At first it may seem like an average game, but as you play it you'll discover that it's a lot of fun and it has a strange charm that will hook you up before you know it. I can't tell where that charm comes from, because thinking back, it's not better than similar games like the mentioned Borderlands, but it's still fun, which is what matters when playing a game.  Sure, it's rough around the edges, not for perfectionists, but if you play a game to enjoy it, trust me, you will like this game. Also, if you have the chance, get the Scorchers DLC, it makes the game better and adds content to the endgame, which the original was missing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having played 690 plus hours of this game (so far) confirms my total commitment to another brilliant production from the id people.  The fact that you can enjoy not only different difficulty levels but also vary your playing direction every time you start a new game is a bonus. Yes, you must follow the given format to complete tasks and levels but they also can be varied in actual excecution (You don't have to do what you are asked or told to do in the order given). Plus you can upgrade and vary upgrade choices as you go which is made much easier once you establish the best way to make money quickly to make purchases.For 'Hints' and 'Bonus' material please refer to my guides section for this game to learn more. There is quite a deal of information there that will assist with gameplay and the acquisition of money required to purchase upgrades.In short 'Rage' is a great game that can be left alone for a while and comfortably returned to at a later date and played again and again. Great graphics, good story line and flexible playability. Extra DLC's would be great to expand this game as it lends itself to more missions.First time through took some 30 - 40 Hrs and this will vary depending on how much or how little you feel you want to do. The game is extremely flexible and I would rate it 9/10.I have uploaded many screenshots that will giva an indication of what to expect.Have fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

IntroductionRage is smi-open world FPS game. The main reasons to get this game is the gunplay, level design,ai and enemy animations.GameplayThe gunplay in the game is really good because if you shoot an enemy leg he will start to crawl to behind cover while at the same time try to shoot you, if an enemy charges you and you shoot him in one side of their body they will spin and at the same time go foward due to their momentum and headshots are truly satisfying where the enemies heads just explode in a really statisfying way.You play as an ark soldier that has regenerating health and has an emergency defibrilator that creates an emp blast that stuns nearby enemies so it basically gives you a second chance but it has a fairly long cooldown. A good portion of the game you spent going into bandit's hideouts and kill them and sometimes collect some quest related items and in that department the game has a fairly large enemy variety. The second kind of enemies you fight are the mutants where the small common ones usually charging at you in wide angle so that way it is harder to shoot them instead of just going at you in a straight line, and then there is the large mutants that are kinda like mini bosses that are quite tough and deal a good amount of damage. And finally the last kind enemies that you face are high tech soldiers with plasma guns and shields.Besides that you also have races that give you tickets to improve your cars and change their appearance based on the upgrades that you get and also have a few diferent paintings to choose from.And finally you have a decent variety of minigames that fit the game theme and one of them is a card game where you play with the cards that you collect throughout the levels, so in that way the game collectables are actually used for something and if you miss one that is in an area that you cant acess anymore the game shops will sell you that card for 1k dollars which is quite alot but the minigames can give you a decent amount of money so it isnt so bad if you miss one or 2.StoryThe story is alright but it is good enough to fit the overall gameplay theme. The ending some people dont like it but in my opinion it kinda fits because the whole game you are just a lone wolf that deals with stuff that people ask you to do in exchange for armor, weapons, money and recipes that will help you make cool stuff. However if after the ending the game continued it would be just an all out war between 2 factions which would be pretty much a completely different game so in my opinion it ends where it is suposed to.ConclusionRage is a pretty good FPS that i strongly recomend to play at ultra nightmare dificulty which is the highest if you just want  to have a truly great FPS experience however the only issue that I have with that dificulty is that the time trials are bit bs because they literally ask you to make perfect run in the first and last time trials but out side of that it is a quite enjoyable experience.

												Very impressive from a visual and technical standpoint, and passable gameplay-wise, though it doesn't do anything too inventive. The game itself feels a tad generic and lacks cohesion.

												Although being the less loved cousin to Doom and Quake, Rage is still fun to play in its own right at least once.... maybe twice 4-5 years later.... while your waiting for the next iD game to come out..  It's great they tried some new IP, pity not much more was done with it.Don't expect an open world shooter.  Lots of stunning visuals and great detail in the environment design.  Unfortunately invisible walls won't let you fully explore your surrounds.  Exploding people with big guns is still fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Solid FPS with some nice Open-world and RPG elements.Don't expect too much from the story. Even though the whole post-apocalyptic universe this game is set in seems very authentic and well done, there could've been done so much more in order to make the story more compelling. There are a great amount of interesting characters, both enemies and allies, which add to the atmosphere.The gunplay overall is not on the level of Killing Floor 2 for example but above average nontheless. The guns handle well, the sounds are realistic and shooting feels satisfying. Different types of ammunition help spice things up especially later on in the game.Throughout the game, RAGE wants you to believe it's an open world shooter. Between quests, it does a relatively good job at it. During missions, however, there are a LOT of invisible walls which can get annoying at times. Most missions consist of going into a cave/dungeon/city/building and pick something up/deliver something etc. and then go back to the quest giver. The levels are generally linear but well designed. You don't have to run back the way you came which prevents the player from losing attention quickly. There are not a lot of areas that I felt like I want to get out of immediately.If you're planning on playing RAGE on hard difficulty, I wouldn't bother. All they did was turn the enemies into bullet sponges. It doesn't necessarily make the game harder, but you just end up wasting a lot more ammo and it just doesn't feel right to see a bandit without any heavy armor take a couple dozen bullets before eventually dying.Overall, I didn't feel like quitting the game at any point, the game kept me interested enough to play it for about 13 hours. If you're into games like Fallout or the Metro series this might just be something you should consider picking up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Borderlands meets Fallout without the charm of either.  I've been playing this for a few days now and I have to say it is interesting but a bit inconsistent.  The save from death system is a bit of a pain, and doesn't always work.  You get a chance to save yourself after being blow up by a rocket, but not falling from a not-so great height.  The lack of an auto-save is infuriating, or should I say, again, inconsistent.  There are checkpoints, not that it'll ever inform you that you've hit a checkpoint, and when you transition through a load screen you get an autosave but the missions are so long it's basically a useless auto-save.  The game is still worth playing if you can snag it on sale like I did, but in the current world of constant auto-saves just get used to having to save your game manually every 5-10 minutes or face the 90's world of starting over two hours ago.

												A post-apocalyptic setting, you know I love it. The plot is simplistic but ""effective"". There's nothing here that you haven't seen before but what is there is done well. This game came out years ago but at the time of this writing the movie Mad Max: Fury Road [2015] came out a month ago and the look of the movie is very reminiscent of this game, in a good way. Sometimes I drove around in my Cuprino just to listen to the purr of the engine.Whenever I think of this game I remember a specific moment: When I enter the Blue Line Station (an area about 2/3 through the game) during a mission I always come upon a single mutant who spawns in a non-agro state coming out of the bathroom. For some reason or another this lone mutant always spawns and never attacks me. He just comes out (hope he washed his hands) and slowly patrols the hallway. It throws me off everytime. Do I have to kill him? Should I? He's not threatening to me, not right now at least. Even if I block his path he doesn't attack, he just stops and looks at me until I step aside. This mindless shoot-em-up made me think about the morality of killing virtual creatures.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoyed the game. It's not AMAZING or anything but I enjoyed it. If you're getting this game, keep in mind that while the game might look like it's open world, the world is just a hub for different missions, which are mostly linear. The missions are still fun though. If that's fine by you, then go for it. People say the graphics are bad, but I think the graphics look good overall, if you look at things from a distance. It's just the closeup textures that are bad.Also be warned that the ending is absolutely garbage. But the game is still fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Atmosphere of earlier missions quite engrossing, but as the game wears on atmosphere seems to decline as weapons improve and enemies stay predictable. The ending is unfortunately quite underwhelming. If you get a nice weapon towards the end of a campaign, you expect to be able to use it, right...well I think they may have missed the mark there. Overall however I can't say I didn't enjoy myself.

												This game is fun :DThe gameplay is good and feels complex enough to immerse you but not so complex as to slow down the action.The gun combat feels good to play and the kills are satisfying. The post-apocalyptic environment is immersive as well and looting enemies and their bases is fun.It's not perfect - the ""open world"" feels limited at times and the graphics can look a bit bland. Also the driving sections feel a bit tedious when you just want to get into the shooting action! But hey these things aren't a big deal.The co-op seems pretty cool as well. Poor matchmaking but the gameplay is good.So yeah, definitely recommended if you want a casual, immersive and satisfying shooter, but perhaps not ideal for those who want a lot of depth.

												Perhaps it's a bit late to write a review, considering the game came out in 2011, but I decided to do it because of constant negativity surrounding the title. Let's take some common misconceptions out of the way from the get go: Rage is NOT an RPG game and it's NOT an ""open world"" game. Its design is mostly reminiscent of games such as ""Quake II"" or ""HeXen"", which used hub levels. In Rage, the wasteland is the hub level. Long story short - the game is an FPS full of action, as expected from id Software.What I really liked about the title is that despite features taken from modern shooters (iron sights, regenerating health) they don't really define the gameplay. You can switch off regeneration via the game console and iron sights aren't really needed - I beat the whole game using solely HUD cross hairs. If you REALLY want a challenge, I highly recommend id.dav81's fantastic ""Rebalance Mod"", it's hard though, you've been warned.The gunplay is excellent - weapons ""feel"" just right and enemies react to being shot accordingly to the wound's location. The graphics and music are also on a very high level - the atmosphere of post-apocalyptic wasteland and its danger is palpable.There is plenty of additional side-quests and mini-games to try, but their number is well balanced not to divert the player's attention from the game's focus - action. They help in building the atmosphere and immersing the player, that's all.The only downside is the ending of the game. It feels rushed and not thorougly thought through. However, at the time of this writing (September 2014) Rage is still the best single-player FPS game I have ever played. Great graphics, balance and, most importantly, gameplay. The ending didn't change my opinion, because in this game's case the journey truly is a reward in itself.I wholeheartedly recommend it to all fans of FPS games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Graphics are what you'd expect from an ID engine, not bad...though I wasn't overly impressed with the muddy looking textures.

												This game was...underwhelming, especially after hearing people compare it to Fallout. It feels like started out like a great game, but the developers got bored with it.  Rage plays alot like borderlands, but without the fun of co-op, building a skill tree through level progression, or finding better/interesting weapons.  -The vehicle combat in the game is pretty stagnant and just ends up feeling like a chore when driving from place to place.  +There's some content to explore outside the main story; a handful of sidequests/jobs and mini-games that might keep you busy for a little while, but have no real impact on the game.+The combat can be chaotic fun, the game offers a variety of ways to kill baddies.  There are a handful of interesting boss fights.  Some environments can be used to your advantage to surprise enemies with fire, electricity, spinning blades, etc.  There's no way that's really significantly better than the others at dispatching enemies, however it can be fun to use these things in combination.  My personal favorite toy in the game was the sentry bot.  The only disappointing part to combat was that it was too easy.  I played through the game on normal and NEVER used a healing item because your health regenerates quite quickly.  And if you do die, your character has a built in defibrillator that will instantly revive you (as well as killing surrounding enemies).  So I would highly recommend playing on a harder difficulty setting.-If you're looking for a good story, this is NOT the game for you.  Where the environments are interesting and varied; the story is very vague and un-engaging; it merely exists as a medium so the game can pit you against seemingly endless waves of enemies.  The ending of the game is by far the most disappointing aspect of the game. (Minor SPOILER ALERT:  there is no final boss, just a few waves of easy enemies.)  The game ends just as the story is getting started.  You have no real choices or impacts upon the world.  Your experience through the game will be the exact same as everyone else, which is why I'm not recommending the game.  I paid $5 for this game on a sale, and I wouldn't advise you to spend a penny more than that on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Get the game when it's on sale.  Honestly, the game does an incredible job of hyping itself up, and then dropping you like a sack of bricks. I remember playing this on PS3 years ago, marvelling at the beautiful visuals and the somewhat-unique post apocalyptic aesthetic of Rage. Of course, I never got farther than the Dead City, or else I would never have purchased it here. The massive mutant boss fight was the most fun, exhilarating part of the game. The rest is just new types of small fry to shoot at. The game, however, has excellent gameplay and I had a lot of fun shooting em all up, but the weapon switching system was just so clunky.  And the saddest part about the whole game, for me at least, was the utter lack of a real relationship with Sarah. She just sits in the ""trophy room"" as a sort of superficial ""trophy"" after the scorchers and never returns to the outside world ever again. ""I don't want to go outside. I want to play video games with you!"" Seriously, ID? SERIOUSLY?? AND THE ENDING. ARGHH the ending.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game awhile ago and on sale, and didn't really get into it. The driving bugged me, and held me back from progressing in the game. Then I tried it again about a year later and really got into it. Once I realized that the races and the upgrades you buy with winning the races made driving a whole lot easier it became really fun, and addictive.  Also the Bandits you kill for the bar owners also give you racing certificates to buy upgrades for your vehicle which is good if you never get into the whole racing thing.In ways it started to remind me of Borderlands.  Although the story line is different obviously.Worth playing for the achievements, even in Ultra Nightmare difficulty the enemies are the same as the Easy difficulty.  However you take serious damage fast, which makes you step up your strategy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Often described as ""Borderlands meets Fallout"", RAGE comes to us from the godfathers of the FPS: id. Due to a number of technical issues at launch, this game never got the credit I felt it deserved - the fundamentals are done really well, but there are some shortcomings as well: Guns sound and feel really solid - as you would expect from an FPS master like id. AI is decent as well - maybe a bit predictable, but their movement is fluid and natural. A well fleshed-out world, containing mini-games, crafting, a wide variety of locales, and more.BUT The ending is obviously a setup for a sequel - seems like this will never happen, thus it feels unsatisfying. The decision to make multiplayer racing only is strange from a company of id's calibre. Even today, optimisation is poor - I still get drops on a GTX 970.If you have issues, I recommend trying the below guide (all credit goes to OP):

												Extremely dull storyline, the maps are tiny enclosed hallways with invisible walls guiding you through the paces.  I have no idea why this game has so many people admit it's bad then give it a positive rating after a bad review.The graphics are not impressive, certainly not to the point of carrying this game into a positive rating.  The shooting is okay but in this generation of games, the bar is much higher than this game could achieve.  I see no reason anyone should ever spend their money on this rather than any number of better games in every area of gameplay.  I respect id, but the gaming industry is fast and fierce and this release just doesn't keep up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is like the kid who got straight 'A's in school, knew all the answers to every test, then went to university, smoked too much pot and dropped out in the second term. In other words, it's a disappointing under-achiever. It looks very pretty (even though it's getting on a bit), and it provides the illusion of some sort of open world, but that's all it is. An illusion. You're ultimately just shuffling from room to room and looking at what's going on. Of course, ""it's a corridor shooter by ID! That's the point!"" You might say, but it's even disappointing in that regard. You have too much health, there's too much ammo, the enemies are too stupid and there is basically no way to actually lose the game. I think I fell over about 3 times in total. And I mean ""fell over"" - I never actually died because you get a 2nd and 3rd chance through a ""defibrillator unit"" which wipes out enemies and revives you if you can manage to mash the E button at the sound prompt. And when I did fall over, it was because I couldn't be bothered using cover when I should have been. On top of the fact that you self-revive for no penalty, you get an endless supply of bandages that you can stuff down your throat to instantly restore your health. I used about 5 of those in the entire game, because it was just so easy. Of course, I was playing on normal, and I *could* have upped the difficulty (and I did for a while), but disappointment on top of disappointment, the higher difficultly levels just give the enemies more HP. This doesn't actually make the game difficult, it just makes every fight take longer and become not just easy but actively boring.I think the actual worst part, and what left me with a sour enough taste in my mouth to leave a review, was the storyline and the ending. The game is hurtling along, introducting all sorts of characters, many of whom are absolutely brilliantly realised and fantastically animated, and then it just stops. Suddenly you're on the end mission, you're handed a minigun and told to go activate a satillite uplink in the enemy base. You do so, get a 15 second cut scene and that's the end. There's no boss fight, no challenge (because you just mow everything down with afore mentioned minigun) and you don't even meet the big bad leader of the Authority (the badguys). Seriously, you hear his voice, once, and that's it. You never even see him. There's absolutely no sense of closure, no sense that you've finished up the story, nothing. It just stops dead and gives you the credits.I suppose I could also mention the races and vehicle combat. The races are ok. They're fun for about 30 minutes, but again way, way too easy and end up just a chore. This is compounded by the fact that the loading times are atrocious, so you spend almost as long waiting for the race to load as you do racing. Great. The vehicle combat exists. It's... there. That's about all you can say about it. If you want a corridor shooter, go play Wolfenstein: New World Order. It's slightly longer, has almost the same story line, but is way more entertaining, occassionally actually difficult and has Nazis to murder. What more could you want?If you've run out of everything else to play, and want to waste 7-10 hours clicking on bad guys, there are worse ways to spend your time than RAGE, but that's not exactly a recommendation, is it?

												As the credits began rolling I finally understood why the devs chose the name Rage for their gameIt's what the player feels once they realize there's no final boss. This is totally unacceptable for a game that gats so much right. Oh you say it's in the $5 DLC? You and Evolve can go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves.Overall it's still good though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A rather mediocre game. The gameplay is fun and the driving is alright but not fantastic. the weapons are interesting and some of the characters are engaging as well. But it tells you almost nothing about the world you emerge into, the story is rather weak and the ending is even weaker than that. And admittedly a am a bit of a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but the textures were all grainy and frankly quite bad looking. I had fun playing it but I would not recommend it to others, it's not worth your time. 6/10 proaly will not play again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												2 words, F*cking Amazing. If you haven't played this game you have to!If you love driving kick♥♥♥♥♥cars and blowing stuff up then this is the game for you. And who doesn't love throwing a three bladed boomerang at people that cuts their heads off? This game is like Mad Max meets Fallout but it is not copying either and is a genuine game with ACTUAL creativity and art design that I respect a lot considering that most of the games out now are the exact same thing.Playing this game again brought back my memories as a child of having an amazing time and constantly smiling while playing and it gave me the feeling of actually being in a apocalyptic wasteland. Sure, the maps are a little linear but who says that this game is bad because of that? It looks like they had to animate each map with extra care and time so I don't complain, because I could never make something as pretty as the maps in this.id software and Bethesda game studios created an incredible game.

												So the game is good, one of my favourites. It's pretty much a shooter with some very basic RPG elements like crafting and items, not to say this is an RPG in any way though. There is also Mad max style cars with some pretty fun vehicular combat. So the gameplay is fun, but what really does it for me in this game is the setting and environment. Its like the mad max post-apocalyptic wasteland but there are these super high-tech sci-fi♥♥♥♥♥overlord rulers and its pretty dope. However the game isn't perfect and the vehicle bits get pretty repetitive and the story isn't that interesting, also the ending is complete wank.Overall I recommend it as I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic and sci-fi worlds and this has it both.

												This game left me feeling conflicted in a bad way. So much promise, a neat post-apocalyptic setting, but there were too just way to darn many ""buts"":""The graphics are gorgeous, BUT despite fantastic hardware I had to manually tweak config files to get it to work decently""""The gameplay was smooth, BUT for those times when it would freeze up every two seconds inexplicably""""The NPCs are interesting, BUT no one cares  or says a thing when you return to base from beating the game. Most of your team isn't even anywhere to be found.""""The combat mechanics are cool at first, BUT then you get to fight the same three kinds of minions a thousand more times.""""You get all kinds of cool guns and keep waiting for the big bad guy that you're going to need them for, BUT the big bad guy never shows up, you saved all your cool weapons for nothing.""""That boss fight in the middle of the game is awesome, BUT  it's the only one. """"Your reasons for helping people start off as a means to survival, BUT later on you are just treated like a lacky and sent on 'get-me-a-beer' and 'make-me-a-sandwich' missions.""""The gearhead boss will taunt you and you can't wait to kick his♥♥♥♥♥ BUT he's just a dude in red armor who dies like a flop.""""They build up a subplot of the mutants being curable , BUT  the doctor inexplicably disappears before the end and  the subplot is left completedly unresolved.""""You defeat the bad guy base at the end, BUT never get to face 'the-bad-guy', just a bunch of faceless minions.""""You defeat the bad guy base at the end, BUT those ***holes are still camping out in your town when you get back and still flipping you dirt.""""The environment is complex and interesting, with huge vertical maps, BUT you can't fall to your death because of invisible walls.""""Your character can jump like a pro basketball player, BUT still can't jump onto a shoebox or other small rocks and stuff.""""You can build stuff from components, BUT aside from door lock breakers, you will probably never need to.""Can I recommend it? It was fun, to the middle, but such a let down at the end. I don't want my friends to be let down, so sadly this game gets  a NOPE.

Posted: January 24, 2014
												id Software has written several pages of videogame history, creating the archetypal '90s shooter with Doom and bringing the third dimension to gaming with Quake. John Carmack and John Romero have created such legacy for themselves that their promises and opinions are to be taken seriously today, even after all the years that have passed since they went their separate ways. So when John Carmack lets it be known that he is about to deliver a shot heard round the world it is quite understandably taken as an accurate description of future events.RAGE is known to most gamers rather from the circumstances surrounding it than the actual game itself. To call the pre-release buzz a hype is a true understatement. Many believed the hype only to be disillusioned on release, with ""is this it?"" being the collective response. And as history has shown, the reaction was justified since RAGE came and went without impacting much of anything, let alone becoming legend. Now that the circumstances have changed a quiet appreciation has grown around the game as it it taken for what it is and not what it's creators meant it to be.The world has ended and the player character awakens to a wasteland, as is custom, and meets the people and the factions that have survived or emerged in the meanwhile. Unfortunately there is no imagination or surprise involved in any of this. There are The Raiders, The Authority (!) and The Resistance as well as The Mutants and finally the common folk. Everything is so generic and lifeless that the names in capital letters are also the only description required. Even more unsettling is listening to the NPCs talk. An abstract, Lydia-like cheer has descended on the survivors and not a single line of dialogue sounds like actual speech. A vendor says ""All my stuff is A-one premo"" in an attempt to simulate humanity with literally everything else being poorly disguised information about the game mechanics involved. Fortunately the protagonist is just as wordless as Gordon Freeman or the Doom Marine before him so there are no attempts at drama. The main story is so straightforward I am hesitant to call it a story and all the characters are merely their occupations. There are no themes introduced or points made. And although many many women dress extremely impractically to say the least there is absolutely no romance or sex anywhere, not even married couples among the NPCs. All the writing involved in RAGE is words, nothing more, and my mood always soured when I had to stop playing the game and listen to the people in it.What makes the world of RAGE even more unwelcoming are the excruciatingly slow and dull opening hours. There are so few places to go, weapons and tools to use and things to do that it takes some self-discipline to soldier on. This is undoubtedly where the synthetic if not downright artificial nature of the world shows its very worst. Fortunately the first day of gaming is misleading: as the world in which you can wander in gets bigger the game gets better as well. The farther away I proceeded from settled areas the more I enjoyed myself. The levels are highly linear but well-designed and even the typical ruins and bunkers are interesting to explore. I was most impressed by the ruins of a great city that felt like nothing had been spoken in them for decades. Exploring these streets was the equal of any other post-human gaming experience and conveyed more meaning than any amount of words could have done.While all the characters are just happy automatons they were at the least well-made automatons and much thought has clearly gone into them, despite well-known influences showing here and there. The animations were exemplary in many cases, especially those of the melee chargers found on many levels. Mutants charge forward in berserk parkour and should they get decapitated they keep running for a few more paces until realising that they have died not a moment before. The gameplay in RAGE is the traditional first person shooting seen many times before and since. It is made enjoyable by the large variety of weapons and quick-use items as well as the enemy behaviour. Only those equipped for close combat will charge forward, while those with firearms shoot from behind cover and finally retreat and regroup at the next defensive position with fresh troops coming in as well. Enemies will also get visibly injured and hobble around in pain or shoot from a sitting or lying position in their last moments. Doing this to the bad guys requires of course appropriate tools and RAGE delivers. There is a large arsenal and while it mostly consists of time-tested pistols, assault rifles and shotguns they universally look, sound and feel good in use. The basic ammunition types are nothing compared to the specialist ones you need to craft or buy at a high price. My personal favorite was the crossbow with four different types of bolts. One of these variants was a mind control crossbow bolt which lets an enemy to be walked to his comrades in remote control to be then exploded by a button press. This is one of the best But Of Course weapons in recent memory and there is undeniable glee in using it. The craftable quick-use items are even better and I was able to use most of them at a constant rate which is to say I appreciated the system very much. The first one accessed is the Wingstick, a throwable weapon looking something like a cross between ceiling fan and huge shuriken. It has limited guidance in flight and will return to the source to be used again later. Decapitating a charging mutant with one and retrieving the implement gave me a self-esteem boost against my better judgement.Controls felt natural and all the menu systems were ideally clear and informative. It is most unfortunate how blurred things can look on close inspection, especially the clutter items. RAGE looks great in motion, however, and my game was a stable one as well. There is a command console and mod support for the technologically skilled. I used a keybind to hide my HUD and weapon to take screens as my only modification. A full third of my 300+ screens are from my RAGE playthrough which is certainly a testament to my gaming experience as a statistic alone.RAGE has one major DLC, The Scorchers, which merits a separate mention. It plays to the strenghts of the base game, with spectacular level design and highly intense gunfights. The story is kept to the bare minimum, thankfully, and the missions are well integrated on the main campaign. The weapon added is also one of the very best available, useful but well-balanced and with three distinct forms. The titular Scorchers also feature some of the most amusing battle chatter available and must be quoted here. Melee berserkers tell you that they love you during their charge and shooters remind themselves of their ""Happy place!"" when wounded. Should a comrade fall the survivors exclaim in sorrow ""We lost what's-his-name!"" and remark how the player needs more therapy. All in all The Scorchers is a highly polished addition to RAGE, equaling the finer levels in the base game and even surpassing them in places.RAGE is one of those games that feel better out of context. It did not change the course of game design and will not give gamers reason to reinterpret the enjoyable hobby in question. But it is beyond any doubt a well-made shooter experience, carrying on certain traditions and expanding on others, all the while being an imaginary world well worth the visit if only for the places alone.

 It's a small open world	""Welcome to the wasteland son. It's pretty ugly out here. I need you to do something for me. We've lost communications with the scouts at the northern outpost. We need medical supplies from them but fear something has happened. Can you please go and check out what's happened to them""And so - after stocking up on supplies and ammunition - you leave the safe haven of the settler settlement and head north towards adventure...for about 10 seconds.Are you kidding me old man? The Northern outpost is about 200 yards away. You could find out what's happened to the scouts with a good pair of binoculars.Oh btw they're dead and you will have to fight 38 mutants, but that's the fun bit.RAGE is a game that's all about scale. It has everything a good open world game has. Wastelands, Cities (well, 2 of them anyway), crafting, side-quests, races, a smash-TV style battle arena, stunt jumps, delivery jobs, gambling mini-games, a really awesome trading card game, and more.And it fits all of this into a match box. This is the smallest ""open world"" you'll ever see. I swear that everything is within a minute distance of everything else. It's both ridiculous and amazing.For the rest, it's pretty fun, the game doesn't take itself too seriously - I think there was a story but it's not that important - the combat plays a bit like borderlands minus the loot but with a nice variety of weapons, ammo, and sentrybots, and all in all it's definitely worth a playthrough. The game ends like it started: abruptly, not far from the start, and without getting boring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In a lot of ways RAGE is a simple game. It's a game where you will drive to a location and shoot things. If you get tired of shooting things, you can build a robot to shoot things. Or RC cars to blow up things. Or throw computerized, bladed boomerangs at things. Either way, the formula is still ""Go here, kill things."" So if you want to chill out, not stress your brain cells, and shoot things, this is for you like it was for me recently.There are some interesting aspects of the game other than the core formula. That would be racing which is effectively kart-racing at the end of the day. I recommend plugging in a gamepad for these to maintain your sanity. It's not bad with the exception of the Rocket Rally, which is a poorly designed game mode as it is based too much on RNG and not enough on skill.The high point for me in this game is the nailgun added by the Scorchers DLC. The rebar firing mode is too fun. Takes a while to reload each shot, but it one-shots all the the stronger enemies. And you can pick up your launched rebar!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is the last FPS developed by id software, the mother of the genre. Combining few RPG elements with free roam and vehicle races, the gameplay is somehow unique. The FPS mechanics are well crafted and gun feel is really good, while races and short travels only represent a break from linear levels, adding some poliedricity wich never results boring. Enemies movements will test your shooting skills, like few games do, and crafting system will need your creativity to choose the right strategy for every fight. Even if the abientation is immersive, the plot is however poor, expecially in the end, making Rage a good game but definitely not a masterpiece.85/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Graphics and the general ""mechanics"" of the game were good, but there just seemed to be something lacking throughout. The story felt like a very weak attempt at blending elements of other post-apocalyptic worlds where everyone decides to go back to gang culture. Not one of the characters felt real. The racing and shooting were great, but with completely flat and unengaging characters and a bland storyline, I never really felt any real incentive to go on (aside from that intrinsic need to finish games just for the hell of it).To top off a vanilla storyline, some parts of the game (dialogue and cutscenes) were just a grind and involved furiously tapping various keys to try and skip poor dialogue from characters speaking ridiculously slowly.To be honest, I feel like the game was a lacklustre FPS version of Fallout plus a bit of Borderlands, but with only a fraction of the fun factor.

												RAGE sets you in a ravaged wasteland world that is home to mutants, bandits and the Authority which all want a piece of you or should I say, a nice chunk of you. The wasteland environment looks gorgeous both in the way it has been designed and the graphics itself which easily helps with emersion. There are perhaps a few iffy textures when it comes to some of the interior levels, but if you can look past that and enjoy the wasteland, it's easily cancelled out. The character models and weaponary also look fantastic.Apart from the main story, the game offers some decent side missions, events and numerous amounts of things to collect. Schematics, recipies (these allow you to craft various things as long as you have parts), collectables, mini games, stunt jumps throughout the wasteland and of course, racing events where you can earn racing certificates to be used in upgrading your vehicles. There are also various ammo types you can use with your weapons.There's a few co-op missions you can do with one friend or a random. They're fun, but unfortunately a little short. There's also multiplayer by way of racing, but as to be expected, the multiplayer portion has fizzled out. The ending could be viewed as somewhat disappointing in the fact that it's left rather open and perhaps there could have been some stronger emphasis on the story, but all small negatives considered, the gameplay is solid, the graphics fantastic and there's plenty to keep you busy with for quite some hours. Having played three playthroughs of RAGE on Normal, Nightmare and Ultra Nightmare, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed the game each time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is a fantastic game with an interesting story line, the intro towards the game is brilliant and makes the game moving and interesting to play on to find what happens. The game does have bad points but also bring good points, my bad points towards the game is, it’s too short, you will spend around 8 hours on the game and you’ll complete it, if you do the side quests and try for 100% completion, it may take up to 15 hours. When you get into your first town area, it’s hard to find your way around the area and can take up time, me personally I don’t want to get lost and waste time trying to find a place where I need to be. However in the towns, you have a lot of stuff to do, such as go to the merchants and buy ammo, items for building items and also you can play mini games to earn extra money in the game. They is also a race events that you can attend to which gives something extra to do in the game and something to complete.The ending of the game seems dull and could have been better and could tell more information on what happened.The graphics towards the game is amazing with a lot of details towards the scenes with shooting and driving around in the care.The mechanics of the game for me personally were hard to get used, but eventually I got used to them, they even easier with a controller. Driving is fluid, walking is fluid and both seem realistic.The game reminds me of Borderlands and a slight hint of Fallout, with rage having it’s own elements towards the game.I am happy with buying this product and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys shooters with a different atmosphere.

												Looks decent, it's a great concept, but the execution didn't quite take. The story was minimal, and the guns, to me, were iffy (I didn't know there were that many left handed AKs after the world ended). It's kind of a fun game to mess around with, but I would say that there are better games out there, most definitely.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent weapon technology! The mechanics in this game are amazing, and I don't just mean the actual mechanics that fix up your badass kill mobile. Running around and shooting people, driving around and shooting people. Mega wasteland FPS version of GTA if I've ever seen one. Favorited.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is pretty fun. The shooting is awesome, the variety in weapons is neat, and the enemies are apocalyptically crazy! For whatever reason, I had the profound thought when I first started this game that the shooting just felt really good. It felt comfortable and just great in general, beyond what other games have done.The driving works well enough, and blowing up enemy cars is always awesome, but there's just a little something missing that keeps it from being great. It was neat to get to use my apocalyptic car to race others, it was a good change of pace sometimes from blasting psychos and mutants. I enjoyed that I could customize my car up a bit, adding upgrades and changing out weapons and such.The world is kind of open, but not in the way The Elder Scrolls or Fallout or Far Cry are, it feels much more linear than that. The places where you can drive feel open but like there are only certain paths to take. Each area you explore on foot has some room for a little side exploration to discover hidden stuff, but it doesn't have the same sense of adventuring as other games do. You can do whatever you want, but there isn't much more to do than shoot up your enemies. To make up for what I'm going to say next a bit, the game does have a unique storyline, interesting characters, and the graphics are really beautiful. It was interesting listening to the voices of all the variety of characters, they had neat dialogue and were voiced well. Unfortunately, even though the characters were neat, the game just couldn't make you care less about what was going on, why you were doing what you were doing, or make you want to care about any of the characters. The storyline is unique, but it wasn't done well enough that it gripped you.Overall, it's a fun game and definitely worth your time, but there is definitely potential for so much more. I'd love to see another game in this franchise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But because its short and hell of fun during that time its worth a game through. It looks amazing and the violence is fantastic! However atm there seems to be some bug with its graphic so the game crashes when entering/leaving other areas and this needs to be fixed pronto.

												Graphics and the general ""mechanics"" of the game were good, but there just seemed to be something lacking throughout. The story felt like a very weak attempt at blending elements of other post-apocalyptic worlds where everyone decides to go back to gang culture. Not one of the characters felt real. The racing and shooting were great, but with completely flat and unengaging characters and a bland storyline, I never really felt any real incentive to go on (aside from that intrinsic need to finish games just for the hell of it).To top off a vanilla storyline, some parts of the game (dialogue and cutscenes) were just a grind and involved furiously tapping various keys to try and skip poor dialogue from characters speaking ridiculously slowly.To be honest, I feel like the game was a lacklustre FPS version of Fallout plus a bit of Borderlands, but with only a fraction of the fun factor. SummaryGOOD - graphics, racing (if you like that part)BAD - storyline, pace, originality			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Scorchers DLC opens up a new series of missions that start in the Northern Wasteland, inside Hagar Territory, where you headed first in the original game. Don’t worry, if you’ve already finished the main story in Rage, this DLC also brings in a new feature that allows you to continue to explore the Wasteland after you’ve completed the main campaign.When you load up your game you’ll be given a mission that asks you to investigate a new gang of bandits called The Scorchers. As you investigate this new threat you’ll meet up with new allies, gain access to new weapons and visit new locations. The great thing about The Scorchers is that the missions integrate into the main game, and the new areas all branch off existing areas in the game. You’ll still be able to visit the same shops, and talk to the same people, in between each part of the Scorchers mission....Nailgun is coming...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is a first person shooter (FPS) with gorgeous graphics in a semi-open world game where there are numerous side quests, racing, and collectibles to accompany the main story line. Covering everything in the game should take a little more than 20 hours giving the game great value. Aside from your typical FPS game there are some RPG elements in this game where you have an inventory to craft some unique items and to collect misc. items just to sell them. The weapons are varied with multiple types of ammo which differentiate the weapons even more. Overall, this game puts the player through a fun filled adventure with amazing graphics and awesome gunfights!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												4 year later does Rage still holds up?Well i am happy to say that it surprisingly aged well.A mess up hybrid (that combine FPS Gameplay with 3rd Person Fast paced driving mechanics) from the minds of ID software.Driving in rage work like you'd expect Fast Paced,Total Destruction Comparable to Twisted Metal.The A.I. is challenging and at moments unpredictable especially the mutants are insane.Were Rage fails it's at being a good Pc Port It's unoptimised.It took me 4 year to Finish it (Because of the lack of support by AMD and there drivers) on Pc with a stable Frame Rate. I had to do my first run on Ps3 (Console version are awesome)And let's not talk about the Horrible multiplayer components of RageAt the end of the day i should not recomend Rage on Pc but Rage is an Excellent Game that should not be missed8.7/10 Verdict: Buy this classic Hybrid when it's 75% off on a Steam Sale. Ps: If you can run it then great and if you cannot run it but you need to play it then ask for steam refund and buy the Xbox 360 or Ps3 version of Rage			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I liked this game. It gets a lot of flak for not being a ""landmark"" title like people seem to expect from id, but that doesn't automatically mean it's terrible. But it's not fantastic. [Note: I did not play the co-op or multiplayer modes]The world is one of the more interesting post-apocalyptic settings I've seen in a video game, with obvious inspiration from Mad Max but with its own twist on the setting. The characters aren't really anything special, just basic NPCs that tell you where to go and what to do, then inexplicably disappear. Despite the cardboard characters, the world itself feels very lived in and real. The various throw-away NPCs scattered throughout towns comment on the events of the game as they unfold, they walk and move around so they don't just stand in one place for weeks on end like many other games, and some even move to new locations entirely.The plot and story start out simple and strong. It's nothing amazing, but it's done well enough that it works. The entire first half of the game is spent doing odd jobs for the various citizens of the wastelands (mostly killing♥♥♥♥♥♥. Turns out, that's just a way of gaining notoriety so they can explain the terrible second half of the game. Roughly half of the way through the game, the game thrusts you into an anti-authoritarian resistance movement that has literally zero connection to the previous arc, with very little buildup to this sudden switch. You go from a wasteland survivor to ragtag rebel toppling a technologically superpower (that's never been done before!). What really blasts the story's coffin into the dirt is the ending: there basically isn't one. You go to a building, press some buttons, and there's a cutscene. Literally no issues brought up throughout the game are resolved. Literally none. You do not win. You do not lose. The ending is totally irrelevant to the overall story.Mechanically speaking, the gameplay is solid. The combat in general is really fun and just feels nice. I did feel as if certain weapons (the assault rifle, pistol with normal ammunition, the DLC nailgun's default mode) were totally useless once you get alternate ammunition or different guns, but they still served a purpose in the long run. What really surprised me is the variation in enemies. There's really only ""two"" enemies in the game: mutants and humans. But each faction of the humans has its own unique look and sound and combat style, which makes combat with different factions feel very refreshing despite the enemies more or less having the same set-up. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the vehicle combat, personally. Late in the game, the opposing vehicular forces mostly just spam missiles and shields and it's just exhausting to fight them. That being said, the vehicles themselves felt very nice and responsive - even with mouse and keyboard.tl;dr It's a really solid and fun game. Don't go into it expecting a masterpiece and you'll probably be impressed. It's not a bad game, and it's definitely above average in terms of quality and quantity of content. Very much worth its current price, and most definitely worth it at a discount. Anyone who disagrees is a bad person!! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												well... I bought this game expecting a fallout-esque post apocalyptic adventure game from reading the reviews, and what I got was more along the lines of a modern DOOM with the look and feel of fallout, with the dungeon design of Oblivion/Skyrim.and what do I mean by that... well: The game is set in a post apocalyptic wasteland after an asteroid has struck earth, there are people buried in things called ""Arks"" much like the vaults in fallout. The guns, landscape, and enemies you face scream fallout.so the gameplay: Not fallout at all... I almost feel like the ability to aim down the sights of your gun is out of place in this game. It is extremely fast paced, I equate it to DOOM or another oldie FPS because I spent a good 90% of the game running around with a shotgun and my boomarang knives rather than hiding behind cover waiting for a headshot, and I am perfectly fine with that. I can't really describe the rush of throwing a wingstick at an enemy for the first time to have it take off their head and come back to you perfectly, It did not get old.and the level design: I really enjoyed the level design and it reminded me first and foremost of Oblivion style dungeons. That is to say that they were very straight-forward and hard to get lost in and wrapped around themselves wonderfully so that there was no backtracking to get back out. One thing you might frown upon is that you get sent into the same dungeons multiple times, even if they do send you through different paths and give you different enemies to kill, it seemed a bit lazy on some of the levels, but was executed perfectly on the Dead City level. The overworld is boring, The car segments boring - but take this with a grain of salt because I hate pretty much all racing games except MarioKart This game gets a thumbs up at it's discounted price which I got it with the DLC for 6,24$  I really wouldn't recommend it for any more than 15$ because it is only about 10-15 hours of good gameplay, unless you love twisted-metal-ey racing			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE:RAGE is a game in a post - apocalyptic world, or if you rather, the Wasteland.This is a game that includes looting (Ammunition, collectives and such) and a big arsenal of weapons that allows you to choose how to kill your enemys in serval different ways. One more cool thing this game have, is CARS, YES! On the campaign you get cars that you can ride in them trough the Wasteland and use them to crash\shot\explode your enemys, or just use them for racing and such.Beside the main missions, which are awesome by the way.... There are also alot of cool side missions that can either give you money or either grow your arsenal if you complete them. The gameplay is so fun, I have to say. Its very smooth and easy to control. And now about the soundtrack, its also OK... They really fitted in the music to the location and the environment you're playing on, the characters, the weapons and the cars soundtrack.. This game is really fun and its awesome!!Highly recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Outside of actual graphics, it is not too great. Although the world is open, the missions make it linear in nature. This is not too scary either, no dark places, so the previous spirit of games like Doom and Quake are lost. The main strength is the graphics, beyond that, it does not really take off or do anything particularly well. The vehicles add some fun but makes the game come off as a jack of all trades. I will likely play it out but lost interest after playing it a couple times and put it down. Not what I had expected for an ID game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thanks to Steam's free-to-play weekend I gave RAGE a jam, what first drew me to download and play it was Snoop Dogg, RAGE is Snoops favourite game.I was a little reluctant at first because as a gamer I can become easily addicted to chasing achievements and didn’t want to delve into yet another post apocalyptic FPS, but RAGE is seeming more like a diamond in the rough.RAGE is a FPS developed by id Software. It uses the company's OpenGL-based id Tech 5 game engine and was released in October 2011.The game is set in a post-apocalyptic near future, following the impact of the asteroid 99942 Apophis on Earth. The game has been described as similar to the movie Mad Max 2 and to video games such as  Borderlands.The mixture of FPS shoot and loot based missions and demolition derby type racing is just enough to be entertaining, if you get board of the same go to point [A] and kill random bandits to recover some junk missions you can enter a race, zoom round a circuit and bash and crash your way across the finish line to earn more upgrades.In RAGE's story, the asteroid 99942 Apophis impacts the Earth on August 23, 2029, leaving few survivors. Human survivors have come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, including race tracks. These fragile homes are diligently defended by the inhabitants against bandits and mutants, which are divided into various gangs and organizations of their own.RAGE has two multiplayer modes: ""Road Rage"" and ""Wasteland Legends"". In Road Rage, up to four players compete in a free-for-all match that takes place in an arena designed to make use of the vehicles. The objective is to collect rally points that appear around the arena while killing your opponents and stealing their points. Legends of the Wasteland is a series of two-player co-op missions based on stories that are heard throughout the single-player campaign.So aside from the basic gameplay and plot overview my personal opinion on rage is to give it a go, even just a few casual missions and there are fun or get right into the game and get all those delicious achievements.If you find yourself really getting into the RAGE universe, Bethesda and Dark Horse Comics announced a three-issue comic book series based on RAGE, also there is an entire novel based on RAGE game.Enjoy killing bandits and making the roads a safer place, but watch out for Mutant's...

												This game have all the necessary potentials it needs to become a perfect game, but it fails to make a final touch to it.RAGE is an open-world, rogue-like fighting game similar to BORDERLAND but with quality graphic. The game concept and art is well made, and the progression of the storyline is indeed very unique and interesting.But what could have been a perfect game falls short when the plot of the game suddenly came to a sudden end that leaves all loose end... well, loose! It is a very anticlimactic, and it just leaves me blank when the game suddenly rolled to the ending credit.As I mentioned before, this game already have all the necessary components ready, but failed to utilize the ultimate ending that would make this game into a perfect piece.The gameplay time is significantly short.Nevertheless, this is still a great game to play, and very enjoyable while it last until the plot ended.I would rated it 8/10, where the -2 is deducted from the loose end plot			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is a great game. many say its bad because of the ending which the ending leaves you kinda on a cliff hanger. but the overall gameplay is amazing and all the different varieties of enemies is very fun and keeps you on edge. the racing just add more fun while you get to blow cars up and take first place to upgrade your car. if you like racing and blowing things up.. first person shooter with awesome guns and cool upgrades.. oh and you get to beat the authorities♥♥♥♥♥which is fun too.. your character makes them look like a ant beneath your boot. anyways this game is very interesting and the story is nice too.. i highly recommend this game. 20/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another solid game from Bethesda and id. Although not revolutionary, it has its own flavour.+ Vast weaponry+ Open world+ Decent graphics and sound effects+ Challenging at times, but not frustrating+/- Car races (necessary to finish the game)- Weak plot- Repetitve side-quests- No replay valueAll in all, I recommend the game to everyone who enjoys a good FPS.P.S.

												I just love post-apocalyptic games. This one is in particular one very atmospheric one. In the world of RAGE everything is just about your ""clan"" and racing. Though I am not really a racing gamer, the racing parts in this were kinda fun. You got different cars, to equip and to arm. Then you take it to the road. I just finished all the racing events in Wellspring the night I started. Although the ""Rocket Rally"" competitions are really getting on my nerves...The other part of the game is about the dangers of the wasteland, especially bandits and mutants. There are some small civilized groups and there are several bandit clans, which each got their own tone. Some are cannibal like, some are in control of the power plant and raise high prices for the energy. It just all really fits well together. The two main things that bothered me was the main story, which at first is nice and you get to love the characters, but later in the game is a little too ""rushed"". The later the game, the faster everything is done.  The other thing was a complete lack of decisionmaking you get to do. You are more of a mindless robot than a symbol for humanities best. All in all a solid game with good atmosphere and characters, that will not get too repetitive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Suprisingly okay despite its huge critisism. Dont get me wrong its quite an console aimed title. Positive: Interesting weaponry              Amusing driving              Fast movement              Variety of enemiesNegative: Linear               Too many scripted spawning events before being able to access foward.               Silly bugs. Like dropping randomly from an elevator.               Many scenes with invisible walls               No real end boss... Like seriously iD..  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is one of the first open world games i've actually enjoyed, while all the others mainly consist of travelling miles to an area then killing a few enemies, RAGE keeps travelling to a minimum and puts most emphasis into its amazing combat. Every shot feels powerful, as every bullet sends your target stumbling and limping. The first person combat sections are usually set in corridored levels full of enemies to mow down, making it a blend of Borderlands 2 (the driving, setting and open world) and Quake 4 (the frantic action set in the fairly common linear area). I recommend this to anybody who likes FPS and open world games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is a mixed bag. There were times, when I was thinking ""Wow, this is one of my favourite games"", and then there were times, when I was cursing the devs for lack of balance (or my lack of gaming skills – depends on your perspective). But I definitely would recommend this game as a great example of FPS.Features:- Great setting that really provides a genuine sense of a post-apocalyptic world.- Decent amount of weapons with different kinds of ammo (a pistol, an assault rifle, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a crossbow, a nail gun, a rocket launcher, a machine gun, a pulse cannon).- Crafting options that improve your statistics and arsenal (health upgrades, armor upgrades, wingsticks, bandages, turrets, sentry bots, bomb cars, EMP grenades, lock grinders, mind control bolts (!), health boosts, damage boosts etc.)- Four types of vehicles: a quadricycle, a buggy, a pick-up truck and an armored vehicle. The latter three are upgradable and eventually have three types of guns (a mini-gun that shoots bullets, a rocket launcher and a pulse cannon).- Three types of character customisation. Not that it matters much.- Fun side-missions- Mini-games (a card game, a knife game, wingstick throwing, roulette, poker, a kind of board game and banjo play). I basically played only the card game, the others were too boring.- Racing challenges where you can earn racing certificates required for vehicle upgrades- Interesting characters and enemies. There are basically three kinds of enemies: bandits (Vasted Clan, Shrouded Clan, Jackals, Ghost Clan, Gearheads, Scorchers), mutants and the Authority. Each of them require different approach.- Easter eggs and hidden arenas with references to previous iD releases (Doom and Wolfenstein). See the guides and YouTube for more info.- Sexy girls with funny monologue lines- A trophy room- Collectible cards (hard to obtain, but you have no other choice if you want to win the card mini-game). There are two achievements for that: one for collecting all cards and one for beating the most difficult deck.- Multiplayer and co-op. They're basically dead. Couldn't connect with my friend to play the Co-Op missions- An option to change difficulty during the gameplay.PROS:- Great, vivid graphics, but, as far as I've heard, they're better on consoles. Though, this is true only for landscapes, because the close-ups are lacking detail (e.g., blurred text, simplified texture).- Tactical gameplay. It's not just straightforward shooting. Your weapon and ammunition choice really matters, you need to use different approaches for different enemies. You can rush forward and take your chances with fast and strong weapons or take your enemies out one by one from cover or you can throw grenades and set back or you can take their heads off with wingsticks or a shotgun or you can stealth-attack with arrows and wingsticks - the choice is yours. You can even use turrets and bomb cars or mind-control enemies turning them into suicide bombers.- Interesting (though a simple) storyline with gradual and smooth progression but and abrupt ending.CONS:- Too much focus on racing for my taste. Also, some of the rally point missions and the third mail delivery mission are too difficult in my opinion. I managed to complete all of them, but seeing, how AI drivers steal rally points right under your nose half the time, was a bit frustrating at times. - Everything is expensive. You're constantly out of ammo or out of money. I had the same problem with Wolfenstein: NWO. I guess it's a kind of iD/Bethesda thing.- Some of the missions are too challenging. Challenge is a challenge, but when chordes of armored mutants are rushing towards you and you don't have time to properly aim and you require a whole magazine per enemy, it's no fun at all.- Video tearing on camera turns. You either need to lower your video settings or try manual configuration (see the guides for more info).- An abrupt ending of the storyline. Leaves a feeling that game was not fully completed.Nevertheless, I think that iD is a great developer and all their games are great, with RAGE being no exception.My overall rating: 9/10. And, yes, the DLC is worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just a bit miffed, I’d sayThere’s a great game in here somewhere, struggling to get out. Unfortunately it never quite succeeds. RAGE was hyped up enormously prior to its launch and I was one of those gamers who looked forward to getting around to playing it. Don’t get me wrong,  I enjoyed the game but I was always aware that it could have been so much better. The story is standard post-apocalyptic fare and, more notably, the script lacks humour. The gameplay and combat, while good at times, are never outstanding. It tries to create the illusion of open-world play but in fact it’s pretty much a corridor shooter with defined routes and little opportunity to explore. The graphics are also deceptive: the landscapes look good from a distance but close-up the textures are disappointing. It should be noted, however, that the background music is quite impressive. There are echoes of both Borderlands and Fallout 3 here, but RAGE is a subpar game when compared to either. It’s a shame that the people who brought us the excellent Doom series failed, on this occasion, to match their earlier success. I’ve no doubt, however, that they will regain their form in the future.3.5/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best FPS experiences I've had in the past decade. It's kind of shooter I was looking for since the original DOOM and Duke Nukem 3D. Relatively short shooting sections go after even shorter story scenes with questing and a bit of a post apocalyptic world exlploration. And the game benefits from that approach. Most redundant features were cut off. Guns look amazing, sound beautiful and interact with enemies and environment so well that after a few minutes I found myself switching weapons only to look at how another goon would die from my beloved 45 caliber compared to the shotgun. It's fun, it's oldschool and it's that rare sort of John Carmack-style games that he doesn't make anymore. So this game is definitely worth checking out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very underrated game. Gave me a solid couple of weeks of entertainment. Con: driving is very fiddly and tricky, and winning races is required to advance plot. Major con: getting graphics working right was a nightmare, especially on ATI, but some samaritan posted a config file guide that solved the problem pretty neatly. Otherwise, one of the best action games I've played. Recommended on sale, naturally.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An underrated game that's ahead of its time. I bought it when it came out, and then dropped it for something else new at the time. Decided to revisit this game after watching the Mad Max movie that recently came out. This game captures that kind of feel, with the wasteland style world, guns, bandits, cars, etc. One of the few games out there with this style!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story: Now a massive asteroid hits earth in the year of 2029. There is several areas that have pockets of survivors that are forced to begin a new civilization. The world is populated by human survivors of the impact, who have come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, including racetracks. These fragile homes are diligently defended by the inhabitants against bandits and mutants, which are divided into various gangs and organizations of their own. Now you the ark survivor comes into the world in the year 2135. Now this game gave me the feel of Fallout which I liked very much. Now people may say fallout rip off. Which I admit ok. But really its not exactly the same. It might start nearly the same but its just a different game. Any way. You fight your way through three area's to help bring the world back from the brink of its near destruction from the Asteroid. I liked this. A nice fit for survival.Game Play: The game primarily consists of FPS and driving area's, with the you using vehicle's to explore the world and travel between missions. Combat is in first person view. You are armed with a variety of firearms from pistols to a nice rocket launcher and my favorite weapon wing sticks (They are like boomerangs). You get different ammo for each weapon. Which you can change to your style. There is two types of enemies Shooting and melee, no need to explain what they do since its easy to figure out. Now there is several vehicle events for you to participate in. Races and checkpoint rallies. Racing events may or may not have opponents, and some of them are armed races while others are not. You have the ability to augment you cars with various items and upgrades you can gain by completing events. Rage also some (RPG) elements, inventory system, looting system and Also able to build a wide assortment of items using collected recipes. There are also side missions and a number of other minor exploratory elements to the game.Now this game is not fully open world like many out there. Yes you are restricted. But there is still a lot you can do. So do not let the closed world put you off. The game is fun and an interesting story to it to.Controls: Easy and simple for anyone to use. Not much else to say on that. Controls can be customized to how you like it of course via keyboard and mouse. The Graphics: The Graphics are really great. The characters and weapons had me drolling. Never seen such good graphics on my system like that and I am not usually some one for graphics.Music: It was good for the game. But for this game I turned it off so I could pay more attention to the game, sometimes I find music distracting in games.Bugs and Glitches: Right this was a big issue. Poor pc compatibility with this port. Rendering issues on the graphics and glitches in the sound along with (CTD's) But with user tweaks and fixes the game got better there was still issues but not as many for me it was just CTD's caused by my xfire. Technical issues with the PC version has led to articles explaining to users how to ""fix"" Rage's problems. AMD had released drivers that attempt to fix some the issues. Then on October 10, 2011 patches for the Windows version were released which added various graphical options to the game and fixed a number of driver-related graphical issues.Reply Value: Sadly I do not find any reply value in this game at all. Its a one time play in my books.Overall: Now the story is good in my books. Game play is good to but there is room for improvements. Controls are easy as I have said. Graphics are amazing. Music is good. Graphics really great. There is bugs and glitches in the game and most are fixed via user help and drivers and a patch. Even for a poorly ported game. This was quiet fun and exciting for me. The ending was nice to shows for a possible squeal. But I am not going to tell you the ending. So my rating for this game will be 7 paws for this good game.

												This game amazing, yes it got it's fair share of problems like texture popins (You can fix most of the texture popins)or framerate problems especially if you're using an amd processor like me. But everything else than?The story, characters, enemies, the world itself. All of these are good things in the game. Let's start with the story, what about it? It's quite interesting even do you're like a errand boy from the past. Characters, they are cool and you will remember them after you have finished the game. Enemies are cool and interesting, some lack design like some of the tribes but the mutants don't get me started on them, they are the coolest thing ever. The design is so ♥♥♥♥ing good and cool. Every mutant look a bit different.The world than, how's it?  I can tell you that I have never thought that a wasteland was cool, but after playing this game. My opinion is completly different, I'm a #1 fan of wastelands now. I even prefer wastelands over the post-apocalyptic zone that we faces in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R serie. So in the end do I recommend this gameA big fat YES			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It isn't a bad game perhaps I was expecting much!!I have played through the whole game in 28.7 hours, completed each and every side quests (left a few), but after 28.7 hours of my life that I devoted to this game in hope of getting something, i was left with an empty stomache and with a bad taste in my mouth. Rage is a fully open world game, which involves sweet elements like the old school arcade type racing & fast paced combat. At first when I started, the opening sequence blew me away, the graphics looked sharp, art design and every graphical fidelity was top notch. I could see vast landscapes, people, bandits running around in their buggeys and all sort of♥♥♥♥♥♥and It made me super hyped up that I want to explore every bit of it. However that soon came to an end.ProsThe game looks stunning considering the fact that it came out 4 years ago. It does an awesome job of introducing new combat mechanics and enemy types. This isn't just an open world fps game, it also involves old school arcade style racing, something that reminded me of some of the classics I palyed back when I was small. This game might not have tonnes of guns but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥! it has tonnes of different bullets!! (Yup! you heard me......Bullets!!). Each enemy type requires you to switch ammunition type. Heavy bullets for heavily armored, insanely heavy bullets for insanely armored. This requires you to plan ahead before infiltrating a bandit camp, stocking up on ammo, best suited for that faction and resources. The game has a good variety and amount of enemy types that it will throw at you to keep things interesting. Weapons are awesome and every enemy reacts differently to different weapon, shoot their legs and they'll stumble and fall or shoot their faces and they'll try to reassure that their face isn't missing by touching it with their hands. The enemy ai is good, really good.The game also has a decent crafting system which let's you craft items on the fly. You usewhatever parts scrap metal, junk you can salvage from the wasteland and dead bandits to create turrets, medkits, lock grinders, RC bbombs etc.THE MULTIPLAYERSince I am playing the game 4 years after it's release, I couldn't find any matches online, Sorry!! ConsRage creates an illusion of being an open world I say this because at first it will tempt you by showcasing these sewers that are scattered all around the wasteland, the bandits carrying on with their work, doing their business but then it hits the speed breaker. When you finally get to explore these things you realize that their aren't that many sewers in the whole god damn game, and one of them unlocks only for one mission. The game will have you infiltrating the same camps again and again and again and again........ and for some f***ing reason you encounter enemies exactly at the same location you encountered them before, so even before you can see them you can fire a rocket straight to the location you had your last encounter and it will work. The world is big and filled with detail but there is not much to it, it all ultimately feels so dull because it lacks the depth feels too much abandoned, there's not a whole lot of things to do in it and it always holds your hand, restricting you from exploring it. Some of the locations which look interesting are locked out even though you could see the enemies shooting at you from a distance. I mean to say why give the players access to a place, which isn't ready to be discovered for another 2 to 3 hrs, so early. The sidequest are probably the weakest part of the game, the game itself is like stuck on a replay button, you do things which you have already done over and over again until you say ""f*** this....I'm out"". The end mission also feels a ♥♥♥♥♥slap to the players face, because the ending does not liveup to the hype that was earlier built throughout the campaign, the excitement to see the fate of the world, the future of your protagonist, what happend to your buddies etc, it's just so out of place and will leave you scratching your head. The NPCs look interesting (but are not) and have fluid animations but they don't have much to contribute towards your immersion and the world itself. This makes me feel so bad, this game feels like a wasted opportunity at the least, it certainly had tonnes of potentiol to become the next fallout people were hoping for.<SPOILER WARNING>   and don't even let me remind you how pathetic and cheap the end mission is, when you are finally ready to rumble in rages final round, you hear your companions warn you, saying things like, ""no one knows whats in there"" or things like ""whatever they are hiding in that facility must be big"" hearing all this got me pumped up, and since they gave me a big f***ing gun to handle with the mess, I started to believe that an epic boss battle awaited me. I stocked up on all my resources, built every sentry turret I could afford and then the big moment came but guess what!! you get to fight chimpanzees, yup! you heard me mother f***ers!! you fight chimps (mutated ofcourse, if that was the plot twist you were looking for)......""they litterally give you a futuristic big f***ing plasma gun to kill chimps"", WTF! VERDICT 7.8/10Sorry! but I just can't give it an 8, even though 7.8 pretty much means the same, In the end, I would just say go ahead and buy it. It is a fun shooter, which will really hook you to it self, as combat is certainly the one part of the game, where Rage shines. Just don' t expect much given that it is an open world game published by none other than ""Bethesda"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For 10 dollars it's alright though I can't imagine buying this for full price at release. Good gunplay. Story and world aren't really interesting. The game never gives you any reason to actually hate the ""authority""/the main antagonists. Ending is♥♥♥♥♥ Some people will hate the driving.It's like fallout without the rpg elements.Or in other words it's like fallout 4 \salso due to how this game renders textures, performance isn't the best. the game likes to crash occasionally			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Put ""Rage"" on your wish list and buy it on sale. ""Rage"" is pretty mediocre. Not *bad*, just mediocre. It plays like an extended tech demo (which is probably is seeing how the marketing is hyping the game engine) that is, it takes the ""kitchen sink"" approach to game design, lacking focus. Everything you could want to do with a  game engine is represented and is polished to a glorious shine and it is shiny, just mediocre. The first person combat is entertaining enough. The driving sections are OK-ish and not actually broken in any way so they get a pass, I guess. There are RPG elements, but they don't *really* matter. There is crafting, which also doesn’t really matter. There is an evil authority, there are vicious mutants and there are good and noble rebels - which in game are called ""The Authority"", ""The Mutants"" and ""The Rebels"". You see? Mediocre. What wasn't strictly mediocre was the enemy AI which would (depending on enemy type) rather effectively take and use cover. This made the combat sections with those enemies stand out from the rest of the game, but not too far out, because this game doesn't really get to far past mediocre.  I would also like to point out that for the PC you will most likely have to create a config file to fix several graphic and performance issues. Once this is done, the game will be beautiful and run very well, but a player should be able to run a game out of the box without having to do this, so instead of ""Rage"" getting and outstanding for polish, it again achieves mediocre.

Although the gameworld can be restrictive and some missions repetative the game flows well enough to keep you interested, there aren't too many side missions and the racing is pretty fun. The physics are good and the weapons have a weight feel to them, plus the AI is pretty good and provides lots of entertainment in torturing them with limb shots.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Surprisingly, after hearing so much negative press, I find that RAGE is quite enjoyable. The gunplay could use some work at times (a magazine of 7.62x39 should be more than ample to take down a human, when all shots hit the head), but the driving is quite good for a game that's a mix of shooter/driver. I haven't completed the entirety of the campaign yet, as I'm playing through the DLCs at the moment (both of which follow the campaign instead of adding end-game content, though Sewers is part of the base game now) but the story is not nearly as hackneyed as many have accused it of being. It feels like Mad Max, Borderlands, and Car Wars had a disturbing little baby.The weapons are nice, there is a good selection of generic staples (the assault rifle, machine gun, shotgun of course) in addition to some fun takes on things like the crossbow and pistol (which uses a removable cylinder and multiple caliber options--not possible but pretty fun in a video game), minigun toting spider drones, turrets, RC car bombs... it's taken a non-RPG shooter and given it some pretty entertaining, though not genre defining, upgrades.All in all, though it is a Bethsoft published product... it's worth purchasing when on sale.

												This game is great!  After purchasing, I immediately played through it 3 times, trying out the 3 different character classes,  increasing the difficulty and finding more hidden locations each time.There's plenty of variety to the game and it's loads of fun.  The story is sufficiently engaging and the world has an immersive atmosphere.It delivers very well as a shooter and the driving isn't bad either.  The weapons are great - they look/sound good and feel terrific.  Combat is very satisfying.Some (all?) of the guns have alternate ammo types (ie: armor piercing, explosive, electric) which you will learn to use strategically (or to completely steamroll the enemy).It features a fairly unique open world which is fun to explore in your upgradable offroad vehicles which you also get to use to partake in violent races through the badlands.I also think the game looks beautiful as far as settings, NPC's, weapons, vehicles, etc go.

												Rage is lacking. I did enjoy some of its parts, but mostly it was just that feeling of unused potential.Pros:-	I liked the fighting system, weapons felt okay-	Locations were well-made-	Plot was a bit blunt but turned out okay-	Ability to drive vehicles – I enjoyed that part of the game the most (I always missed that in Fallouts)-	Games world’s atmosphere similar to Fallout’s (but definitely inferior in all the aspects)-	Cities were alright-       I like the graphicsCons –-	Boring races… Seriously that could have been done much, much better…-	Bandits on the roads – annoying-	Not opened world (something that only pretended to be opened, but was really few closed locations connected by closed roads)-	World was boring and too small-	TOO SHORT! Game ended so suddenly…-	Compatibility problems – some of the add ons made my game to crush in my native language (was okay when I changed to English)-	Dreary NPC-	Gameplay “on rails” – no choice where to go or what to do… Just go forward with what game had for you.-	Side quest were… boring…Conclusion,Well, I expected something better…. But maybe my expectations were just a bit too high after playing in masterpieces like Fallout 3 or New Vegas.RATING 3.50/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The only reason I brought this game was for the co-op.I literally thought the co-op was the campaign, which it is not.You can do the co-op in less than 6 hours and then multiplayer which is fun for abit before you realise that there are only few modes and maps.Graphics: They are actually very good for this game and have a weird style which makes this game very enjoyable with the added graphics. Audio: I find the audio very unique with some very well made sounds from guns to voices...Controls: Very easy to get used too, which is a pickup and go game, seriously it's easy. Game: The campaign is suprisingly fun though, so you will have fun playing it.  It just really really cries to play the campaign co-op which I hoped it would have. The campaign it seems to be very very long, I've been at it hours and not made a dent but has taken me on a wild journey already. The game is decent made, with lots of hidden secrets and thing put around which you might not notice, like a character wearing a Doom T-Shirt.  Fallout 3 bobble head.  Characters names from games, Quake walk arounds etc.This game is unique and fun to play and I hope they make a Rage 2 but do full co-op.Would I recommend this game? Yes because it is a very unique game and worth the money to play if you are after a long story driven diverse different wasteland game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: November 27, 2013
												I remember hearing and waiting for this game back in '08. I actually remember them announcing that Rage would be coming out sometime in April, 2009. Yeah, that's how long I've been waiting for this game. Long and behold, it's finally here.For those who didn't know, this game occupies 3 DVDs. That's right, the game weights 21 GB. Well, at least Sony's Blu-Ray format doesn't have that problem. I am also extremely glad that the developers didn't trim down the game so it could fit on one DVD (you know, if it can fit on one DVD for the Xbox, then it can fit anywhere, kind of like what happened with the trimming down of the GTA 4 world map because of the DVD format.)Anyways, the new engine is astounding. The textures are amazing, especially the faraway ones. I get a stable 60 FPS with my Fermi, 8 GB Ram and 2.93 icore. It is very nice to see a new engine and not some re-used or re-updated albeit old inherently engine like Unreal 3.0.However, do not expect this game to be open-worlded in the same sense that Fallout 3 and New Vegas are. The world seems large but you are only confined to small and medium sized areas. As you play, more of these areas become available and you can go back if you want to, but this game is mostly linear when it comes to navigating the world itself.There is not enough exploration to go around but I absolutely love the environments - none of the environments repeat. I love the abandoned buildings, hotels, sewers, back alleys and such. It is something that I always wanted to experience in the last two Fallout games but couldn't because of the lack of the said environments, because of the recycled areas with the same textures and objects and because of the outdated engine. This time however I can't stop taking snapshots via Fraps and Steam.There are several types of enemies. Some of the punks however speak with a British accent and have British flag tattoos, but most of them look the same (a homage to Mad Max and Doomsday (2008) perhaps?). There are some other medium and large-sized mutants.I like the fact that there are several vehicles and that you can customize them. There are also several ammo types for each weapon, however all I really ask for is for head shot to equal instant death, which is not the case in this game unless you use a shotgun up close.You can also create some new items that will help you advance in the game as well as access some closed off areas so do not hurry to sell every junk you find because you might need it.As far as the weapons are concerned, well I'd say that most of them get readily available within the first few quests, so you do not really have to work hard to get them. Plus the ammo is not that scarce for some reason, so do not expect any Metro 2033-kind lack of ammo. Also, half of the weapons look like they were taken from Crysis. I would also expect some weapons to be home-made.There' s no way to skip the occasional cut scenes or hurry up the monologue, BUT if you take a few steps away from the person giving you the quest, then the quest becomes readily available without you having to hear the whole story.The enemy AI is good. They dodge bullets, take cover, retreat, advance and throw grenades - everything that you really need. It is also satisfying to blast some of the melee-wielding enemies. They don't always rush at you either, they actually try to surround you.This brings me to another point. The gameplay itself is what truly shines in this game. The fire fights and the shooting just do not get old. It is extremely satisfying to fight the hordes of mutants. You can craft sentry turrets and sentry bots(like in Doom 3) to help you out. You can also craft various types of special ammo, and since there's no weight limit, there's little reason to sell junk that can be used to construct the dozen or so different things.When you die, the nanomachines that were implanted in you moments before the asteroid collision and the subsequent hypersleep serve as a defibrillator. Meaning if you die, you can revive yourself once or twice before the defibrillator recharges. There's a tiny minigame involved that determined how much health you get once you are revived. And by health I mean how red your screen is before it turns normal since the game has regenerative health.The characters you encounter are all unique. They all have different clothes, voices and personalities. Some give you new quests, some just do small chit-chat. The secondary characters even have names.There are some easter eggs scattered around including a few that pay respect to Fallout, like the bobble head and the water purifier chip.The minuses:Let's get this out of the way: You can't see your legs and you cast no shadow.Oh, and you are also mute. All you can do is listen.I like the fact that you do not have any maps or minimaps when you enter new unknown areas ( I don't like excessive HUD), but friendly towns could use some indicators because it causes some confusion when you enter a new friendly place and are trying to navigate between the newly introduced characters and quests.When you drive a vehicle you get a third person view, however you cannot look around or behind you which really constricts your view.The sky looks amazing although it is static. It's like a giant wall paper.The dead bodies disappear quickly, but at least they won't do so unless you loot them. So if you want to increase realism, do not loot the bodies.I don't think I've encountered a single checkpoint or an auto-save. That's right, your entire progress depends on your manual F5 saves, what's more is that every time you save, it takes 4 seconds for the screen to unfreeze. Annoying but necessary. So if you forget to save and die, you will have to repeat your last progress from your last save.The game is also extremely easy. I'm playing on the hardest (Nightmare) mode and I steam roll over everyone and everything. The quick regenerating health is part of the issue.The most important thing is the lack of a good and consistent story. This game nailed almost everything but the main story. You wake up from cryosleep and you get thrown into the semi-open world of fetch quests. For some reason people around you assume that you are a killing machine who is able to take out hordes of enemies and fetch supplies. No one ever explains why you should be doing the things you are doing. One might think that there is no need for one coherent story in the huge 21 GB single player post-apocalyptic world but I beg to differ since this is not an open-world game. You cannot bypass quests and go wherever you want, there ARE constrictions.Overall, the game feels like playing a Mad Max movie with the elements of Borderlands, Fallout, and Some Metro 2033 elements. But that is not to say that any ideas were stolen or re-used for this game. Rage is its own kind of animal, it is unique and it's got plenty of peculiar style. The world is believable and immersive. And the game itself gets better and better as you play it.Highly recommended. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun and intense first person shooter set in the future of wasteland earth. So, it’s a little bit like Mad Max then? Well, it’s about 99% Mad Max-like. I mean you’re going to see insane weaponry, vehicular combat and bandit gangs, so it’s safe to say that this is a Mad Max themed shooter, but definitely not a movie clone. Graphics: 10/10For a game that is nearly 5 years old, it still impresses me on how good it looks. It’s not “perfect” by any means, but its good enough that you will think that this game is newer than it looks. Not to mention that you don’t need an overly powerful graphics card to run it; a GeForce 9800 GTX or an AMD equivalent is just enough to get playable framerates. This also goes for both the CPU and RAM. No need for a fancy £1000 rig to enjoy this game. Storyline: 7/10You are emerged into a wasteland earth full of bandits, gangs and mutants. You are seen as the ‘hero’ of the game and you learn more about the places and the people the more you play further into the story. It’s the generic story where you defeat all the mutants and gangs, whilst doing unrelated side-quests along the way and eventually “save” the world. It’s nothing new to the table in terms of storytelling and I wouldn’t personally call this one “story heavy”, the game is an experience and is for experience, not to be fully immersed in it. It certainly delivers that experience in a decent sense. Sound: 10/10The sounds of gunfire, the roaring engines and the clarity of the voice acting is at its best. Every bit of soundtrack has been fined tuned to sound how they were supposed to be heard. I am proud of what id Software did here. What an impressive achievement. Gameplay: 9/10It delivers very smooth and very polished gameplay that many is sure to enjoy for hours. The controls are responsive and the game difficulty is well balanced. The only downside is that you have to keep checking if you have enough ammo for a weapon as ammo in this game is very scarce, especially at the start of the game. Price: 10/10For the price of £12.99 and an additional £3.49 for a DLC, it is reasonably well priced and is definitely worth buying. Although, I suggest waiting until it goes on sale to get it.

												There are so many amazing things about this game, it is entirely underrated. Unfortunately a lack of marketing combined with the overall lack of content are what ultimately made this game less successfull than its 2011 classmates such as Skyrim. With that said, to this day this is easily one of my favorite games that I have played. What the game lacks in content is makes up for a million times in character, beauty and overall fluid gameplay.In comparison, RAGE vs. Bioshock (any of them) Rage wins in actual gameplay and mechanics while Bioshock would win with the strong storyline. They are  both incredible games, but put the stoy-type that Bioshock has into this game and honestly you have the perfect FPS game.I'll start with Cons:-The game is short, there is no way around it.-There is more more that they could have done with the 'racing' aspect of this game. It really is more of a mini game within the game but it offered versatility in a fairly constricting game.-This is a FPS with linear story progression, there is very minimal sandbox-type capabilitiesThe Pros:-Gameplay is just delightful-Weapons are varied and the bow with environment interavtivity and ammunition types is just increible.-The various ways to approach every single fight whether it is through exploding remote cars, guns blazing, etc... The game boasts strong versatility in gameplay.-TONS of mini-games within the game that are all pretty fun.-The story is very entertaining-The game is full of vibrant characters and monsters-The art style is great-The graphics are just beautiful considering a 2011 release date.-The engine was truely a pioneer, boasting ZERO, I repeat, NO replicated areas or terrain types. (To explain, in most games, areas are replicated, reconfigured and reskinned. For example, in Fallout you may notice that a lot of areas are quite similar. This does not happen in RAGE as the engine was developed to be able to specifically alter each area, each rock, each spray painted wall.) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is a difficult game for me to recommend or even describe my thoughts on. On one hand, there is one main (and important aspect) to the game that the game nails in spades (imo). However, on every other hand the game fails to deliver with…just about everything else. For me: The most important aspect to a videogame is that of its gameplay. With that in my mind on games, RAGE, to me, is the biggest counterexample to that claim that I have ever seen and played.The basic premise is an asteroid fell to Earth and ravaged the planet creating the homeland and setting to the main game, the Wasteland. You play as an Ark survivor who awakens to find the rest of your Ark members dead. Afterwards, you activate a panel that opens the door and step out into the desolate world. You enter the Wasteland and encounter some of the enemies that you will be fighting later on your journey and after being saved by Dan Hagar (played by John Goodman). You and him set off for town to begin your adventure and help in the ongoing battle against the bandits who rule the Wasteland.Right off the bat, story wise, you can tell this isn't going to be any more than just a slapped on, Grade B, generic story that's sole purpose is a background for you and your rampant annihilation that you bring onto the enemies of the Wasteland. To be fair, id isn't really a company well known for their story telling, characters, or even their open worlds like say the Fallout series. However, in RAGE it feels like id was putting more emphasis on story and characters than their previous works; it felt as if id really wanted to break free from their simplistic shooter roots of just running and gunning with barely and reasoning behind except, ""Screw it! Why not?"" That and the modern warfare market the FPS genre lives in now makes it difficult for future FPS games to not include it in the main game. Either way, the singleplayer portion of RAGE story wise is painfully average at best with characters that are barely memorable or interesting; they leave absolutely no impression on you and are there solely to have you help them in the form of missions. Missions in the game aren't really good either, they're your standard RPG-esque affair of, ""Clear out X area."" Just like about everything else in the game, missions are typical, offer no variety, and ontop of everything else is uninteresting and stock; it makes for one very average package. Voice acting is decent, some voices sound rather strange for the setting they're in and some voices don't feel right with their character design but otherwise the voice acting isn't too terrible, but, with such stock and uninteresting characters it hardly matters. Again, this wouldn't be too much of a big deal given id's previous works but considering how much more emphasis id has put on the world and the characters this time around it's a shame that this is the end result.The big surprise for me, though, was in the graphics. Graphically, RAGE is stunning; the textures are crisp, the detail is insane, and the models on characters are incredibly well done as well as their animations. Id's new Tech 5 engine is quite a looker and is better than most of the other engines FPSs and games in general are running on these days. What really stuns me is just how well the graphics worked for my PC; I'm not well versed in PC terminology and graphic fidelity but here's what I will say: I can barely play Skyrim on high without my computer struggling to run 15 FPS let alone 30; RAGE, however, was buttery smooth throughout my whole time playing it. The game didn't lag for me, I didn't need to downgrade the graphics, and, besides a few graphical issues here and there, looked absolutely amazing and ran impeccably well given my machine. Graphically, RAGE looks incredible but visually, it's very unappealing; that does more or less have to do with the setting at hand rather than the art department’s fault plus I’m not a fan visually of post-apocalyptic settings. Even if I was I feel RAGE would still disappoint me on that ground; it lacks any personality and doesn't stand out from the rest. It has no defining characteristics and is just as stock and generic as the characters that inhabit the world. Yes, it is a post-apocalyptic setting so it's rather hard for the game to have ""personality"" but, come on. You can't say that no games set in the post-apocalyptic future setting don’t have personality. Again, going back to the Fallout series, some of the games have personality to them and are much more interesting than anything and anybody in RAGE. Graphics are great on RAGE and look great on my PC, it's just that the graphics that make up the world are uninteresting and lack any real defining characteristic that sets it apart from the rest.As stated previously, the biggest aspect that this game and id knock out of the ballpark is the gameplay (well, half of it at least). Keep in mind, I have not played a previous id title before RAGE; I have seen footage of their other work but I have never really played any of their other games so I have no previous knowledge on how well their previous FPS mechanic offerings have been. I can say, though, that between all my other FPS games that I've played previously, RAGE might just be the best that I've played in that aspect. Every gun feels excellent and meaty to use, gunning down enemies is a blast, and besides one gun (shotgun wasn't really as good as I was hoping it would be) all the guns sound great to fire; though, in my time with the game there were barely any guns outside of the pistol, shotgun, assault and sniper rifle, and rocket launcher. RAGE isn't as fast paced as Doom or Quake so there is a little bit of weight and slowness to your character but even with that restriction the FPS mechanics in RAGE are some of the best I've seen since the original Crysis.On top of the excellent FPS mechanics, RAGE also offers racing and car combat gameplay. Driving mechanics, for the most part, aren't to terrible; there were some weird moments like whenever I made a reversal U-Turn so that I could go back and destroy the bandit's buggies I turn a little faster than when I'm turning normally so instead of a 180 degree turn around it was like a slight 270 degree instead. It was weird and frustrating but for the most part the driving is pretty solid in the game; it's just not as good as the FPS mechanics and is really only used as a means of travel. Car combat I found, mechanically speaking, OK but personally for me I just found it rather boring more than anything else. Also should mention that I have not played a single second of the multiplayer as, from what I've heard, the multiplayer focuses more on the driving and car combat aspect. I also didn't play any co-op because, I had no idea co-op was even apart of RAGE. Though, honestly, co-op is co-op, it's practically a given at this point that with friends co-op can be an absolute blast especially if co-op focuses more on the FPS part of RAGE than the multiplayer did.Overall, RAGE is a difficult game for me to like. It nails the FPS gameplay and the graphics are great but everything else in the package ranges from decent to below average. There's barely any creativity to the game, you don't care for anything or anybody in the game, strange design choices, while OK not a fan of the driving or car combat, and because of the emphasis on story and characters the game pulls you out of the gameplay more so than it should. RAGE is not a bad game, but it is a very weak game given the id's broad history. Keep in mind I only played it for 12 hours if even that, maybe later the game picks up the pace but from what I played these are the feelings I am left with. If you can focus more on the meaty and excellent FPS mechanics more so than I could then you'll probably find RAGE a more enjoyable game. If not then there's not much else that the game really has going for it so my advice: skip it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is a mix of FPS and Driving genres, set in post-apocalyptic desert setting and with some dose of RPG elements, this comes in form of inventory and hub world. Yep, still developed by id Software, who mostly were doing FPS games, and released in 2011, published by Bethesda by that time. It runs on id Tech 5, main point of which were mega-textures.There were few versions of RAGE. If you pre-ordered then you would recieve Anarchy Edition. You can also buy it separately but no on Steam. Anarchy included few unique items to make players more powerful, including Double Shotgun. From what I understand some of Anarchy editions came with code for Sewers DLC. You could also buy this DLC separately on consoles. There are also some comics and ""making of"" videos, Collector Edition came with those. And then there was Campaign Edition for Mac OS X that included Anarchy Edition content plus Sewer DLC, but was singleplayer-only.While Steam version is not Anarchy Edition, it comes with Sewers DLC for free. And that's good, because this DLC gives sewers levels that are filled with mutants which can challenge you only in the very beggining. Not something worth after beating game.As far as I know the only good difference between consoles and PC is that consoles support split-screen for multiplayer.The thing is that this game apparently was hyped as being really open-world RPG, but in the end people got hub of corridors between each traditional level, making people dissapointed. And because id is a brand and people expect revolution, even though id only did it with Doom1/Quake1 long time ago. And since people want everything post-apocalyptic game to be either Fallout or Borderlands, well, it got underrated.Technically, it had a lot of problems at the launch. John Carmack came up with new feature called Mega-Textures. You may think of it as super-detailed textures, but what it means is that artists can can place something nice in one spot without it looping all over the wall. He must have been expected that hardware people would be the one who would rush to give proper support for that feature, but RAGE wasn't Quake 1 and no one cared. And so majority of players experienced huge issues with textures pop-in, where everything will take seconds to become clear when you look at it. Thankfully, game was patched around and hardware moved ever since, so it should be fine now.At least it shows that programming fancyness of John Carmack is better at developing cutting edge VR tech than games, where ""can most average players hardware run it"" is more important.It also has a multiplayer component. Which is being run by lobby system. And community of which is quite dead.It has two modes. No, not Deathmatch and Capture The Flag.The first mode is Road Rage, which is competetive and uses Racing genre of a game. Has a few sub-modes and is designed for 4 players. Didn't get to play it. Just check YouTube for gameplay.Second mode is Wasteland Legends - cooperative FPS. It's designed for 2 players and seems to use unique short missions. Or you could play them in singleplayer, alone. Well, not all that unique, it uses assets from single-player, but it's not same layouts. Plotwise they tell stories of behind-the-scene events, something silly like ""how Dan got Sniper Rifle"". There are no inventories, few weapons, you occasionally come across supply which will max out your ammo, if you run out of defib then your friend will have to come and revive you. Not much value for singles, better drag a friend into it.And yes, as many people will tell you, plot isn't good. For RPG. If forget that this is mainly linear FPS/Racing game. So it does job fine. Then again, seeing the hype it was dissapointed. But don't worry, setting combined with amazing graphics are still fun. Seeing all the new amazing NPC designs and hearing the way that each enemy clan communicates with each other, as well as finding out in what enviroment they live, is what was the driving force for me. Game also has great atmoshpere. It goes from surviving wasteland, to more of feeling of just well-stocked desert and then ends with more of techy and resistance feel.The bad thing is ending. If you played enough id games then you will be smart not to expect epilogues. And then many games have some ""you are awsome"" ending, teaching players to appericate journey, not the ending. But then this time they forgot to put final boss or any climax battle in. You just got this cool gun that can shoot BFG rounds and you just derp through weak enemies. Still, not a huge flaw.As for gameplay, it's a classic id shooter. Well, in modern linear level design, where you have one path and any other path is usually filled with knee-tall trash that you can't get over. But the shooting and action itself is great fun. Do people still consider having 9 weapons at same time as old-school?Weapons can use different kidn of ammo types. Like shocking water with elector-bolts. Or beating the hell out of heavy armor guys by loading your pistol with Fat Mammas.And you have a few items you can use, most notably explosive RC cars, placing turrets and using wingstick. Wingsticks is a boomerang that homes at enemy, is strong and can even return succesfully. It's Rage's title weapon, so to say. Shame that whether it breaks or returns seem to be based around randomness than skill.Animations of enemies makes it feel like proper FPS too and not some RPG, with them getting wounded while running, falling onto ground and shooting at you from there. It's mostly hitscan-abuse type of game, but at least regenerating health keeps it sane. And defib, where you can still revive after death. Most common enemies are melee ones that rush you straight or ranged ones that hide behind cover. What is great is that later they take more hits than your average modern FPS cannon fodder and can maneuver around, while giving a look of intellegent enemies by communicating, making it dynamic. It also helps that each clan is a bit unique, like Shadow clan has bandits that are more acrobatic.I once got sneakily killed from shotgun from behind, so it's cool.Racing/Driving part takes a secondary place sadly. It delivers finely, in that you can drive between missions in a hub world or do a racing. Boosting, minigun and rocket-launching and all that. It has arcade physics and feel to it, aside from having to purchase ammo. But it doesn't have much aside from shooting rockets at enemy. And racing events don't have many tracks and don't seem to be too crazy, they just kinda get repetetive after a while. It still a good part with explosions and ramming, just not deep. If they had some physics rampage and destroyable objects, then at least it could be as ""aw yeah"" as Flatout games.You also get some open-world stuff that are very few towns. Where you can grab some quests of racing. Or play some not interesting mini-games. Cards one is kinda cool. Or you can take a job quest, which is mostly redoing the beaten levels. Still cool lively locations, but don't put focus on them. Don't forget to purchase some ammo and ingridients. Game has too many ammo for few weapons to be survival, but very few for stuff like Sniper Rifle. Oh, and you can craft. This game also gives a bit of survival feel by making you scavenge, picking various trash in missions to sell it later.Main issue with it is that it doesn't manage to mix FPS and Driving well. Those are kept separately. Hub and races for cars, missions and towns for on-foot. Which may be good, as FPS people have to beat only 2 mandatory races. But still, could make it more interesting this way.Oh, and music provides background for action and varied but nothing to remember. And there were like, two bosses.But overall, if you come here for your linear id Software FPS with a bit of racing and not some Fallout or Borderlands, then you will have fun there. Hub world with linear missions are still good games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are so many amazing things about this game, it is entirely underrated. Unfortunately a lack of marketing combined with the overall lack of content are what ultimately made this game less successfull than its 2011 classmates such as Skyrim. With that said, to this day this is easily one of my favorite games that I have played. What the game lacks in content is makes up for a million times in character, beauty and overall fluid gameplay.In comparison, RAGE vs. Bioshock (any of them) Rage wins in actual gameplay and mechanics while Bioshock would win with the strong storyline. They are  both incredible games, but put the stoy-type that Bioshock has into this game and honestly you have the perfect FPS game.I'll start with Cons:-The game is short, there is no way around it.-There is more more that they could have done with the 'racing' aspect of this game. It really is more of a mini game within the game but it offered versatility in a fairly constricting game.-This is a FPS with linear story progression, there is very minimal sandbox-type capabilitiesThe Pros:-Gameplay is just delightful-Weapons are varied and the bow with environment interavtivity and ammunition types is just increible.-The various ways to approach every single fight whether it is through exploding remote cars, guns blazing, etc... The game boasts strong versatility in gameplay.-TONS of mini-games within the game that are all pretty fun.-The story is very entertaining-The game is full of vibrant characters and monsters-The art style is great-The graphics are just beautiful considering a 2011 release date.-The engine was truely a pioneer, boasting ZERO, I repeat, NO replicated areas or terrain types. (To explain, in most games, areas are replicated, reconfigured and reskinned. For example, in Fallout you may notice that a lot of areas are quite similar. This does not happen in RAGE as the engine was developed to be able to specifically alter each area, each rock, each spray painted wall.) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The only problems with the game is that it is too short, it lacks content and is limited on explorable land/areas.- AMAZING story- AMAZING gameplay- Very unique in almost ALL of its aspects- Beautiful graphics - Cool npcs...- The list goes on and on.Its unfortunate however that the game had SO much more potential and I WISH they included more and perhaps even a more open world as I loved the story and path of the protagonist (even though the protagonist himself lacked importance - perhaps because he had no voice) and simply would have given this a 10/10 if there were more towns/interesting places to visit.Therefore im forced to give the game an 8 out of 10 :P Still amazing. Praying that they release RAGE 2 with a more open world/longer story line to follow.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am really baffled by how much Id missed the mark on this. Aside from the blatant copying of Fallout and Borderlands, the game doesn't really do much to peak any interest in the post-apocalyptic-FPS-barren-wasteland-desert-survival games. Like, Doom and Quake, Rage just continues to throw enemies at you as you trek through the same areas over and over (and sometimes backwards). Yes other games make you return to the same areas (Borderlands) but Rage's linear single hallway design makes it tiresome. The racing feels so out of place and the in-game economy is very broken. Yes it's pretty when you're looking at stuff far away, but when you're close it's really gross. No wonder Carmack left Id.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This one's a mixed bag for me. For one, the story is pretty good, considering the usual stuff we get in FPS at least. It's interesting, well written and it's got good dialouge. Just don't expect Metal Gear levels of depth and you'll be fine. Gameplay-wise it's also on the good side, with varying locations and enemy types as well as good boss battles. Don't go in expecting this to be fallout though, as much as it is ""open world"", the world is fairly small with not a lot to do in it, compared to other open world games.The AI is servicable if predictable, they will however react to getting shot in different ways depending on where you shoot them (yes, that includes groin-shots). Overall, pretty good again. This game also has a fairly big focus on verhicles and racing aswell as vehicular combat.What kills it for me is the port. The mouse acceleration and -smoothing is oh so very strong with this one, and you need to dig in the config files to get rid of it. And trust me, just setting mouse sensetivity to zero doesn't help. The performance is equally bad. Even on my GTX 760 I can't play this game on any higher than medium setting without having the framerate go lower than 30. And the texture pop-in is massive, it can take take multiple seconds to load texture if you turn.Conclusion: I'd recommend this game for anyone who was gonna use a controller anyways or is willing to fix stuff themselves. I've had my fun with it (~20 to get through with the campaign and some of the sidestuff) and don't regret the purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As single-player FPS, it's quite good (if easy). Imagine Borderlands but with better characters and upgraded graphics. Controls are responsive, and there are very few cutscenes or slow character animations to interfere with gameplay.Unfortunately, you'll spend almost as much time driving cars as you will shooting guns, and as a driving game, it's overly simple and not much fun. No multiplayer.If you have a fast enough computer to run this at the higher graphics settings and if its on sale cheap enough, this is worth picking up for the eye candy... but don't expect to replay it.

												The whole idea sounds like fun: doom meets post apocalyptic wasteland with an open world. The only problem is that the wasteland is a carefully built walled garden with no openness at all (invisible walls galore) - actually it felt like a dated corridor shooter. The graphics are quite nice, but I'd rather play with brutal doom with a couple of mods than this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is an interesting game considering its pedigree. It was a game that was released too late. Allow me to explain.Rage had many features that were standard in the industry by the time it was released, which made the game feel like it was either behind the times or just not developed with enough substance. I felt it impossible to not compare it to other games that were released in the same time frame and felt that it brought little unqiue gameplay mechanics to the table. The tropes of older games are also present such as bountiful backtracking, red shirt enemies and linear layouts disguised as open world.Had this game came out a few years earlier I think I would have received it better, but the entire time I was playing the game, it reminded me of something better I had already played. So take my ""Not recommended"" with a gain of salt.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No variation. 100 men the same, each level.-Not enough vehicle customisations.-John Goodman*-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI*The Good Stuff:-RAGE delivers a great FPS Single Player Story.-Interesting guns, vehicles and locations-Doom and Quake fans will love it. Lots of moments that take you back.-Despite the low detail textures, RAGE looks amazing in some areas.-Regional AI damage. Shoot them in the foot, they limp. Shoot their knees - they fall.

												Mind numbing missions, that provide zero motivation.Paper thin plot.Average gunplay.Very linear.I have only been able to play 2 hours of this game because the texture pop-in is so extremely distracting. Nothing is cached so any 180 degree movement causes the world to be plastered with textures lower resolution than the original Quake for a second. Graphics are well done so are the animations, thats really all this game has going for it. Not a bad game, I enjoyed it initially but it is missing character, substance, storyline.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some days I thought of on what game to make the review, and here Rage fell into hands. The distinct plot in Rage actually begins and comes to an end with an introductory roller. The asteroid Apofis slowly flies by through external limits of Solar system, punches a huge hole in one of rings of Saturn, at all takes down a half of the Moon and under sad music falls to the Ground. There for the guest already wait — participants of the special Ark project plunge into hibernation in underground shelters to wake up in many years and to restore the destroyed civilization. You — one of the volunteers chosen for burial, and your ark after more than hundred years of expectation at last wakes up and at the same time awakes you. All other inhabitants of a shelter were lost as a result of refusal of life support systems, behind a window — the desert filled in with the sun. Welcome to the wonderful new world. Everything that occurs after that, only creates visibility of advance. To you don't explain with sense that occurs around, don't help to get used to the new world, don't represent the villain who wants to be destroyed immediately and without trace. NPC constantly give different tasks, but each new mission is desperately similar on previous, and all of them as a whole are necessary only in order that you had a formal occasion to go to the next cellar and to pull a metaphorical eye on a metaphorical♥♥♥♥♥to the next company of mutants. No real subject movement in Rage happens. The same history — from an automobile component of game which developers too very much advertized. In reality cars are necessary to move first of all between not numerous settlements and kvestovy locations. In the second — for participation in boring races, whose only mission — to allow you to lift enough means to buy new wheels or to decorate the car with skulls. Fortunately, it is not all that is in Rage. It at all the most important. Because the main events of game are developed in catacombs and mines, underground dens and laboratories. To put it briefly, in an action part. And here is how a pure shooter of Rage — one of the most fascinating and worthy games this year. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).

												RAGE is one of those games that I love to hate. I frequently find myself wanting to punch my screen, and continue on at the same time.I started this game on Ultra Nightmare difficulty because I am somewhat of a masochist. I held my own after learning the mutants attack patterns, and figured I could progess slowly through the game using a decent plan of attack and ammo conservation. I quickly realized that not only would I never finish a Bash TV episode without a hypochondriac's collection of bandages, but I also could not win a race that involved a time clock. I spent the entirety of my UN attempt broke and without ammo in my guns and my car. I was basically reloading the same pathetic attempts to ""luck out"" without pulling my hair out of my scalp.After 20 plus hours of this anxiety attack inducing frustration I dialed it down to Nightmare and have been progressing at a steady rate. I am totally addicted to the game when it comes to fps combat and enemy commentary. I find myself giggling as much the last time I heard ""Hey he killed what's-his-name!"" as I did the first. I have found most of the weapons have a direct purpose at least once, and the art style is somewhat of a favorite of mine.The downsides I have noticed as a current player of at least mediocre knowledge of the game would definitely include the racing controls and overall uselessness of most weapons in the game. I am not using a gamepad so maybe that contributes to my problem, but it seems like the more I upgrade my cars the worse they perform. Every situation I use the car in (combat races, open world, time trial, etc) the car seems to perform differently. I assume there is some form of scaling invovled in different scenarios, but I don't know if that's true. Either way it keeps me from grasping a familiarity with the vehicle I have invested in, and takes away from the overall level of enjoyment when it comes to racing. Once I have the story mode racing achievements finished I'll probably avoid it all together on future playthroughs.The weapon selection is farily decent for a standard single player game of this kind. The problem for me is that even on Nightmare (and Ultra Nightmare for a short time) I find myself using four guns. Two of them for all average encounters and two of them for special ones. I used standard buckshot in the shotgun and steel tipped bolts in the crossbow in every fight I find myself in. Crossbow is for human combat, and the shotgun is for mutant combat. I never bother with anything else leaving most of my weapons forever ammo capped. In circumstances out of the norm I use the double barrel shotgun (Anarchy DLC ftw) armed with Pop Rockets, and the pistol armed with Fat Mamas or Killstrikes. The double barrel with Pop Rockets takes down any large scale boss or DLC related special mutants in seconds, and the pistol with said custom ammo destroys armored humans in a similar fashion after I shoot off their helmet using the crossbow. Perhaps my experience will change once I reach the end of the story and battle the Authority, but that has yet to be discovered. I find the automatic rifles to be ammo dumps that destroy my accuracy overall, and even with armor piercing rounds just feel totally underwhelming. The nailgun fits into that category as well, and I haven't used it since I finished the achievements related to it. I know its ammo is retrieveable (rebar only), but so are crossbow bolts that don't take 4 seconds to reload.The crafting system is keeping me interested until I have all the schematics aquired. I mostly only use it for turrets (still trying to kill 5 enemies for the Steam achievement and will probably have to do this on normal difficulty) and lock grinders for obvious reasons. I only spend four more dollars on bandages if I just buy them compared to buying the pieces (Crimson Elite armor from Anarchy DLC ftw) and after earning $40,000 at the poker machine 4 bucks just isn't all that much compared to crafting time. So basically the best part of this system is crafting my pistol ammo. Kudos for putting a crafting system in, but 90 percent of the time I'll just skip it.Multiplayer in RAGE seems like an afterthought. I generally don't get too invovled in fps multiplayer modes due to general lack of interest, but in RAGE the coop was very fun for a few days. The voice chat feature worked great and saved me from needing to be on my Mumble client. My friend and I cleared everything on both difficulites except three missions. We never finished the Bash TV episodes on Nightmare (good God), and due to an end level glitch we could not finish Grab and Go on Nightmare.Also, where are all the people for the races? Even on the f2p weekend I saw no one on it. We sat for quite a while and I tried solo que a few times with no luck. Two Steam achievements I won't get unless I get two more people on my friends list who have the game and we just que up with four of us. C'mon now...so many in game badges based on the multiplayer races and no one is attempting it? Requiring four people before I can even launch the race keeps us forever alone. Seems like a waste to me, but then again maybe I just missed the golden era for this games racing mode.After almost 40 hours in my playthrough (I take my time and try not to miss anything...the first playthrough is the most important to me) I already know I will at some point play this through again. Most likely on Ultra for the achievement and normal to clean up any missed achievements after that. This game offers much more than some folks would have you believe as long as you can get past the occasional pop in and fairly standard story line. I would definitely invest in future DLC or anytihng related to this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE presents the most solid FPS experience to date, the controls are perfect, smooth and plays out just how you'd want them to, which isn't suprising considering ID software is the father of the FPS genre. They try to expand the genre by adding vehicular combat, and some RPG elements, but unfortually, these aspects of the game, while not entirely bad, dont compete with the FPS portions of the game.

												it doesnt really deserve a recomendation but it doesnt deserve to be condemed either, its more so-so.RAGE doesnt live up to the hype that it is advertised as, it can be vissually spectacular but most of the time it isnt and looks like id has been lazy when making it. The only part i would say is not lazy is the scorchers DLC. it is a good DLC but doesnt off set the poor qualities of the game like the laziness of the construction, the lack of respawning enemies outside missions plus salvage doesnt respawn either (both of which leaves completed areas desolate after missions and can make it difficult for the more trigger happy players to keep ammo up to stock), the story line starts off good but gets weaker and weaker closer to the end and the ending makes the game feel cut short with no final boss, the racing elements of the game feel like they have been jammed in where they arent really needed and dialoge is not skipable which can get irrirating, weapon customisation is available but is very limited on only applies to a handful of weapons, gadgets are only usable in a handful of occasions (with the exception of grenades and sentury bots) and finally voice acting is mostly appauling. The mini games are decent, nothing overly special but decent to earn a little extra cash. The AI is a redeeming light of the game and does make the combat more interesting and the differnt ammo types can give additional punch when needed.over all the game was okay to play and leaves me feeling that the game didnt live up to all i expected it to be and doesnt make use of all of its potential with the exception of the scorchers DLC which is good but ends up being fairly short and objectives can be a little vauge.

												Its another great game made by id, a little diferent from the previous ones but if anyone used to play their works, landed in the middle of the game, soon realized that it was made by id bc of personal touch.The campaing is lenght enough to keep you busy playing for some time, there are main quests, secondary quests, challenges or mini games, races and some exploring to get all the collectibles.The plot is simple enough to follow, but it is the world that make me come back, with some interesting characters and funny enemys, there is always something to do to keep up the pace.The multiplayer is very diferent that what most are used to, so many said ""tackled"", Spec Ops the Line is a tackled multiplayer at is core, Rage is a diferent concept only ""have fun but not to serious"", that is what most people forget when launching multiplayer games now days, we see online, on foruns, well almost everyhere, the same old bla, bla, bla K/d, bla, bla, bla noob, bla, bla, bla, win, but very few talk about fun or enjoyement, and trying to make rage mp a competitive orienteded mode will only lead to frustration for something that wasnt mean to be.Last you still have wasteland legends, that is coop mode, pretty much like the horde mode, but with a more controlled pace of the fight, that extend even more the fun in this game, there you have all enemys that you faced in the campaing divided by sections/levels and each one with its own story, that can be named of second campaing mode, but with friends/randoms.So if you are not a speed demon rushing to finish games and go to foruns say that they lack content, you have many hours of entertainement in Rage, many possibilitys of gameplay  and very relaxed moment, for that reason, i would recomend you the package.

												I would recommend it as a good play because it really is a good twist to an RPG. Hard to hit characters in first person and lots of vihicle explosions in third person.The storyline is....cut short. Great beginning, exciting climax, and dissipointing finish.In the end the game isn't GREAT because you have too much health, there's way too much ammo, the enemies are too stupid and there is basically no way to actually lose the game.

												This is a must-play for any shooter fans tired of Call of Duty rip-offs and unimaginative zombie games that plague the market.Rage takes a format of shooter I never knew I wanted and brings it into the light: fast-paced, frantic, edge-of-your-seat, run-and-gun chaos.  The best and most memorable moments include walking through a creepy corridor before being ambushed by bandits (essentially Rage's zombies) wielding knives, fighting a mutant boss while sprinting around and making use of the last of your weapon's ammo, or picking off bandits from a distance with a perfect headshot from your sniper or silent crossbow.  I could go on.  This is a game that, when at its best, relentlessly aims to leave you on the edge of your seat.  If you want the comfort of cover or friendly A.I.'s by your side, or like casual shooters that you can unwind and relax with, RAGE is not for you.  For everyone else, keep reading.Besides the frantic action, the game succeeds in equipping the player with awesome weapons and providing enemy A.I. that actually pose a threat.  Nothing ruins a shooter more than a bland array of generic assault rifles and pistols.  Rage provides the player with numerous guns all available at the tap of a button and every single one is fun to use.  The standout of them all isn't a gun at all, but rather a letal and silent boomerang called the Wingstick.  It specializes in decapitating bandits at the press of a button and was by far my favorite weapon in the game.  Every other gun performs remarkably too, leaving the player with a number of options to tackle a threat.  Will you take out that bandit from a distance with a crossbow headshot?  Maybe you'll run and gun with your hip-fired shotgun.  Or why not drive a C4-strapped RC car into a few bandits and blow them to bits?  The options are nearly limitless and always entertaining, leaving a satisfying feeling every time I achieved a creative kill. Thankfully, the remarkable enemy A.I. prevents you from becoming too OP.  I was repeatedly stunned by how seamlessly the A.I. would find the most direct route to eliminate the threat (a.k.a. you).  Think that low wall in front of you will deter a bandit?  Prepare for him to scale it without a second thought.  Missed a headshot with your crossbow bolt aimed at a bandit 50 feet away?  Get ready to frantically pop off shots as he jumps from platform to platform and weaves in-and-out of obstacles in an effort to slice you to pieces.  The occassional bosses and mini-bosses also put your twitch reflexes to the test.  This is a game that puts your aim and reflexes to the test.The frantic gunplay is where Rage truly shines.  Unfortunately, Id Software tried to change up the formula with driving/racing diversions and ""open world"" elements that ultimately fail to deliver.  I say ""open world"" because the game is really rather linear.  The only real exploration you'll do is on your brief, 5-minute drive to your next location.  As I mentioned earlier, the tight corridors and frantic, edge-of-your-seat gunplay are where Rage stands out from modern shooters.  Id's decision to tack on generic open world elements is not only surprising, but also takes away from what makes Rage unique and entertaining.  You are encouraged throughout the game to battle enemy vehicles with your vehicle-mounted minigun/rocket-launcher combo and compete in races.  While the on-foot A.I. are challenging, the driving A.I. never pose much of a threat.  The game encourages you to spend money on vehicle upgrades, but the enemy vehicles are so easy and the ""open world"" is so small and lackluster that I never bought any car upgrades beyond what I was required to to progress.  Usually an engaging story and entertaining missions can save a boring open world and crappy driving gameplay.  But the story and missions are easily Rage's worst features.  The game opens with an epic scene of a spaceship crashing onto a planet.  The player steps out of the reckage to witness a beautifully rendered, post-apocalyptic wasteland and through a series of conversations essentially finds out he is the chosen one from a distant past.  Beyond that, I had absolutely no idea what was happening in the story.  For some reason, my character was special and the enemies wanted me dead.  The narrative was so poorly explained and random that I can't imagine anyone playing the game to actually follow along.  Unfortunately, the missions aren't much better.  Prepare for fetch quests galore that you perform for no real reason.  The main storyline is essentially ditched in favor of short tasks that involve getting upgrades to ultimately defeat...something?  I was never sure who the main enemy was or what I was working towards in the game.Thankfully, I didn't really care.  The gunplay was so fun that I was eager to help gather some generic supplies for Mr. Cartoonish Mayor, just to decapitate a few more bandits.  The driving segments are short enough to never be game-breakingly annoying.  And the enemies were engaging enough to never stop me from sitting on the edge of my seat, anxiously anticipating the next bandit to sprint at me with a knife.  The odd steampunk setting mixed with a generic post-apocalyptic wasteland didn't do much for selling me on the narrative or goofy characters.  But ultimately it didn't matter, as Rage is a stellar game that every shooter fan should play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gaphical Fidelity: ID outdid themselved with the visuals of this game. The texture qualities themselves may not be astounding. But the vastness of the world and details of each individual component make it quite a breath-taking sight. For me, it is still one of the most visually appealing games i've played. The artstyle is damn impressive.Performance: As much as i'd like to say all good things about this game. The texture popping is something that was an issue on release, and still has not been properly patched till this day. It's not a major issue, and not too noticeable on my computer rig, but it doesn't exactly make ID look like they put a lot of time into fixing the game.Design: I love the character and map design. Each enemy type has so many different variations, it doesn't feel too repetetive when fighting them. Plus the characters you talk to are each unique and memorable in their own way, wether it be serious and rought around the edges, or kind of goofy.RPG Aspects: This is something that kind of looks like it was shoved in last second. Don't get me wrong, it works, but it feels unfinished. You don't have any stats you can mess around with for your character. The clothing you wear is picked out of 3 different variations near the beginning of the game, meaning not a lot of variety. There are basic upgrades for armour, and for your individual weapons, but they are very basic. The coolest part would probably be the item crafting. Even though it is quite simple. It makes you go looking for the unique parts required to make certain items, such as the explosive RC cars, lock drills, bandages, etc.Story: Honestly, story could have been better. It sets the tone quite early on and I quite liked how it began, but without spoiling anything, the ending was a bummer and quite of left you hanging. Plus, you can't continue playing after the campaign to explore which I thought was silly. The ending really allowed for it...Voice Acting: Voice acting was fantastic, I don't have any issues with it. Frankly they had me at John Goodman.AI: The enemies AI was frankly one of the best parts of the game. They aren't your typical baddies that just stand there or rush directly at you. They were far cleverer than I expected. I found that enemies with melee weapons would duck and weave to avoid your shots, plus jumping, rolling and climbing to make them quite adept at reaching you without being hit. Any with ranged weapons wouldn't just stand there, but use cover wisely. Retreat if you were bearing down hard on them, advance if they found they had an advantage. Not just that, sometimes they would work together; for instance, the Authority had units that defended with a energy shield, and other units would hide behind him for protection.Weapons: The weapon design was quite good, but what made the guns so much fun to use, is their sounds, kickback, and also the phsyics implemented when an enemy was downed. If you shot an enemy in the head, their helmet would fall off, shoot them in the leg, they'll limp or topple over. Hit them with a shotgun, they'd go barreling through the air. As a FPS, I absolutely approve, and found the shooting aspect solid.____________________Presentation: 7 (Clearly high production, but story was weak and not all the characters were that memorable)Graphics: 7.5 (I would of given this a higher rating if the texture popping issue was fixed)Sound: 8.5 (Sound was overall impressive, especially on the weapons. Plus voice acting was above par most of the time)Gameplay: 8 (Excellent shooting sequences, but I did find the car comabt kind of tedious)Overall: 8 (A large amount of content for Single player, but only about 7-8 hours for the campaign. Does include co-op missions and a car combat competetive mode which is nice)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The best and most memorable moments include walking through a creepy corridor before being ambushed by bandits (essentially Rage's zombies) wielding knives, fighting a mutant boss while sprinting around and making use of the last of your weapon's ammo, or picking off bandits from a distance with a perfect headshot from your sniper or silent crossbow.  I could go on.  This is a game that, when at its best, relentlessly aims to leave you on the edge of your seat.  If you want the comfort of cover or friendly A.I.'s by your side, or like casual shooters that you can unwind and relax with, RAGE is not for you.  For everyone else, keep reading.Besides the frantic action, the game succeeds in equipping the player with awesome weapons and providing enemy A.I. that actually pose a threat.  Nothing ruins a shooter more than a bland array of generic assault rifles and pistols.  Rage provides the player with numerous guns all available at the tap of a button and every single one is fun to use.  The standout of them all isn't a gun at all, but rather a letal and silent boomerang called the Wingstick.  It specializes in decapitating bandits at the press of a button and was by far my favorite weapon in the game.  Every other gun performs remarkably too, leaving the player with a number of options to tackle a threat.  Will you take out that bandit from a distance with a crossbow headshot?  Maybe you'll run and gun with your hip-fired shotgun.  Or why not drive a C4-strapped RC car into a few bandits and blow them to bits?  The options are nearly limitless and always entertaining, leaving a satisfying feeling every time I achieved a creative kill. Thankfully, the remarkable enemy A.I. prevents you from becoming too OP.  I was repeatedly stunned by how seamlessly the A.I. would find the most direct route to eliminate the threat (a.k.a. you).  Think that low wall in front of you will deter a bandit?  Prepare for him to scale it without a second thought.  Missed a headshot with your crossbow bolt aimed at a bandit 50 feet away?  Get ready to frantically pop off shots as he jumps from platform to platform and weaves in-and-out of obstacles in an effort to slice you to pieces.  The occassional bosses and mini-bosses also put your twitch reflexes to the test.  This is a game that puts your aim and reflexes to the test.The frantic gunplay is where Rage truly shines.  Unfortunately, Id Software tried to change up the formula with driving/racing diversions and ""open world"" elements that ultimately fail to deliver.  I say ""open world"" because the game is really rather linear.  The only real exploration you'll do is on your brief, 5-minute drive to your next location.  As I mentioned earlier, the tight corridors and frantic, edge-of-your-seat gunplay are where Rage stands out from modern shooters.  Id's decision to tack on generic open world elements is not only surprising, but also takes away from what makes Rage unique and entertaining.  You are encouraged throughout the game to battle enemy vehicles with your vehicle-mounted minigun/rocket-launcher combo and compete in races.  While the on-foot A.I. are challenging, the driving A.I. never pose much of a threat.  The game encourages you to spend money on vehicle upgrades, but the enemy vehicles are so easy and the ""open world"" is so small and lackluster that I never bought any car upgrades beyond what I was required to to progress.  Usually an engaging story and entertaining missions can save a boring open world and crappy driving gameplay.  But the story and missions are easily Rage's worst features.  The game opens with an epic scene of a spaceship crashing onto a planet.  The player steps out of the reckage to witness a beautifully rendered, post-apocalyptic wasteland and through a series of conversations essentially finds out he is the chosen one from a distant past.  Beyond that, I had absolutely no idea what was happening in the story.  For some reason, my character was special and the enemies wanted me dead.  The narrative was so poorly explained and random that I can't imagine anyone playing the game to actually follow along.  Unfortunately, the missions aren't much better.  Prepare for fetch quests galore that you perform for no real reason.  The main storyline is essentially ditched in favor of short tasks that involve getting upgrades to ultimately defeat...something?  I was never sure who the main enemy was or what I was working towards in the game.Thankfully, I didn't really care.  The gunplay was so fun that I was eager to help gather some generic supplies for Mr. Cartoonish Mayor, just to decapitate a few more bandits.  The driving segments are short enough to never be game-breakingly annoying.  And the enemies were engaging enough to never stop me from sitting on the edge of my seat, anxiously anticipating the next bandit to sprint at me with a knife.  The odd steampunk setting mixed with a generic post-apocalyptic wasteland didn't do much for selling me on the narrative or goofy characters.  But ultimately it didn't matter, as Rage is a stellar game that every shooter fan should play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is the perfect combination of FPS, RPG and Open world with good graphic and good gameplay.If you like Dead Island style, talk to npcs and get quests for them and they'll pay you. You can not miss this game.There are a lot of things to do, missions, bets, races, minigames, etc.In town. You can get main quests to continue the story or get side quests to get money or races flags to buy things, weapons, supplies, vehicle upgrades, etc. Or you can sell your treasures for money.Wasteland. There are bandits that will take you off so you have to take them of before by shoot them or crash them with you veh.You won't be bored if play this game(fast). I'm not good at talking so I don't know what to say you have to try this.Have fun ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was surprised with how much I enjoyed this shooter due to the otherwise ""meh"" reviews.  If you prefer the more mobile, traditional shooter without cover and few cinematic cutscenes, RAGE is a must have.It also has operworld vehicle sections which frankly I didn't care for.  Also, the story is a very flimsy device to send your player from set piece to set piece.  Yet, those set pieces are mostly of very high quality.If you like shooting enemies and watching fantastic animations react to bullets, this is the game for you.  Throw in some light RPG elements to give the gameplay that little extra punch.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun game. played it through a few tiumes now and never gets old. I do with id would have made a FPS multiplayer instead of vehical based gameplay seeing as they are the pioneers of the FPS genre but a minor gripe considering how fun the campaign is to play. Noticed alot of texture popping wasn't sure if that was my system or the game itself. slightly dissapointing are the boss battles but I feel as though this game is more meant for the experience of the world rather than an assembly of boss fights.

												RAGE is one of the greatest flops that I have seen in video games, but it is still blows my mind every time I play it. RAGE is a first person shooter! A lot of people don’t seem to understand that, but it has been pretty clear from the start. This is NOT another Fallout or Borderlands! I don’t understand where everybody keeps getting this from. RAGE differs from Doom 3 in the fact that there are “safe” areas and the main world map has opened up a little bit giving you freedom and a break from shooting stuff with your shotgun, but at the heart of things it is still a FPS.Pros: Rage was created by id software meaning that the shooting is superb. Every weapon just feels good and sounds like it should. Wingsticks: The wingstick is the best weapon in the game. It is essentially an offhand quick use weapon that is a sharp boomerang of decapitations.Mega Textures: Id Tech 5 uses mega textures which make the game look gorgeous (when you are far away). Driving around in your armed buggy outside in the wasteland looks amazing and has a great feel to it.Water: The water in RAGE looks really good. There is not a whole lot of it and there is no swimming, but it does look good.Memorable Characters: The townsfolk that you run into are often a bit goofy like they stared at the sun too long, but they stick in your head.Enemy Mobility: The enemies in RAGE are very agile (especially the mutants) and often climb on the walls or ceiling or are jumping over a rail or down a floor. Other “Weapons”: There is more to RAGE than the shotgun (though the shotgun is always a good bet) there are items that you can “build” such as the sentry turret or bot and use them to help you out on your journey.DLC: If you are liking RAGE get the DLC and play it after you finish the game, since it gives a better ending.Cons:Mega Textures: The down side of mega textures is when you are close up. If you go up to a soup can on the self it is all but a blur. There are some resources that can help to make this problem better, but it can only get so good due to the lack of higher quality texture file released by id.Texture Popping: Basically you have a higher texture quality popping into place when you turn around in the game. This is a fairly common issue among lower end computers, and can be a primary reason to not play this game. There are some fixes for this but generally if you have a higher computer it won’t be an issue. Note: AMD cards have been known to have performance issues, but I haven’t experienced this. Saves: The auto save feature in RAGE is all but broke. Don’t rely on it. Save your game whenever you want manually… Simple as that.Story/Game World: The story of the game started out pretty good, but went downhill quite quickly. I felt like you are the only person in the game world that can do anything, and things like money are only there for you to use. The world is fairly static and default jump height doesn’t allow you to jump up on boxes or crates.Ending: RAGE is essentially the first part in a two part story/game and the ending shows it. The ending makes since, but ultimately it is a letdown.At the end of the day I really like RAGE and think that it is a great game, though it has been overlooked because of these issues. Hopefully id can fix this stuff and produce an amazing Doom 4, but we will have to wait and see. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone that likes FPS games and to pick it up with the DLC when it is on sale.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage. a mediocre game, nothing more, nothing less. The game itself is visually appealing and has good shooter mechanics, physics, driving combat mechanics and voiceacting. On the other hand, the story experience although being a fair length, is uninspiring, subpar in both content and execution and the gameplay feels like a series of fetchquests you would find in an MMO. The world is a postapocalyptic one, with mutants, human settlements/shacks, and bandits all fighting for control. There is limited freeroam, most of which is in your vehicle which is arguably the most polished part of the game. The driving combat is relatively well done, and overall is fun, and with towns offering race challenges you will honestly have a blast with this fair bit of content, so much so that you wonder why there is even a single player shooter game outside of this. Returning to the singleplayer story, it can be best summarized as Fallout 3 with better visuals, a very linear focus, bland execution and even vaguer cliche story. The game wobbles back and forth between relatively inspired story driven missions, and pure padding (fetch this, kill that), which although extends the duration you will spend on the game detracts from the overall experience (this is of course following main story arc, if you branch there is much more tedius missions). The game does feel like it is marginally unfinished or rushed in terms of the single player experience, and it answers few questions and returning to the previous points, some missions are well done, others not so much. The multiplayer experience is a nice touch, but has minimal longterm appeal, again the car racing is arguably the most enjoyable portion. Despite all this, the game is a worthwhile playthrough, although it is nowhere near the caliber of the obvious comparison of Fallout 3/New Vegas, it is however a mediocre first person shooter experience, worth a buy if you have the time and the patience.

												Rage is fantastic! It was automatically in my game favorites within the first 10 minutes of gameplay. This game is like Borderlands meets Fallout with a bunch of other game love sprinkled in. It features explosive post apocolyptic shooter style gameplay with races, minigames, and  a ton of secret items to find. Oh and did I mention crafting and upgrades? This is serious business! Although the baddies are hilarious. Definitely a must play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful graphics, good controls, ok storyline, ABSOLUTE♥♥♥♥♥♥ENDING.Very good for a Kill Everything time waster, but don't go in expecting more than guns and guts.  Everything storywise falls apart in the end.I still enjoyed the guns and the various ammo types, but was disappointed to see so few upgrades for your weapons, and a rather limited number of hidden secrets, or build schematics.If you go in just wanting to see some pretty visuals and glorious gory deaths, this is visually worth the cost. Just be warned, the game will leave you wishing they had taken advantage of many of the introduced features.I won't spoil any story, but I will say that the ending felt like a boat, sailing smoothly until it plummets off of the face of a flat flat Earth.I had to verify that I had in-fact, beaten the game.

												Amazing game! Great gameplay, stunning visuals and interesting characters. This game just has the full package! The story sets in a post-war, apocalyptic world, and the visuals could not be better. From the landscapes to the tiny details, everything looks great with a unique art style that reminds borderlands. The gameplay is probably the strongest point in Rage, and it was probably the main focus of the producers. And what a great job they did! I was actually searching for a FPS that suited my gameplay style, and Rage just hit the spot. It has loads of guns, some of them pretty creative, lots of different ammo for each weapon, turrets, RC bomb cars, you name it. It has diferent enemies too, which requires you to play a different style against each one, and has some fun bosses too. The roaming areas are open world, while the shooting areas are narrow spaces, clearly telling you where to go (despite sometimes I get lost for a moment, but that's becaus I like to search every bit of floor searching foor goods :P). This game also has a car racing component, which is not bad at all. you can roam in the open world by car (or other ground vehicles) and you can race with them. The driving is quite arcade, keeping it simple, but is well balanced, nevertheless. The vehicles also have diferent weapons to shoot the other vehicles, so there's that. The characters in this game are rich and well done, and despite of what they say to you won't be crucial information, you just want to listen to them, because of how interesting they are.The only downside in my opinion is the story. While it promisses a good story at the start,  the story simply doesn't develop too much, wasting all the potential it had. This game also has some few frequent minor bugs related to the image, like showing the desktop for a fraction of a second (nothing to worry about). Overall, a really great game for people who just want to have a nice session of shooting, repeating their favorite missions on the highest difficulties (and they are challenging) and dont care that much about the story. Highly recomend it! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is one of those games that I love to hate. I frequently find myself wanting to punch my screen, and continue on at the same time.I started this game on Ultra Nightmare difficulty because I am somewhat of a masochist. I held my own after learning the mutants attack patterns, and figured I could progess slowly through the game using a decent plan of attack and ammo conservation. I quickly realized that not only would I never finish a Bash TV episode without a hypochondriac's collection of bandages, but I also could not win a race that involved a time clock. I spent the entirety of my UN attempt broke and without ammo in my guns and my car. I was basically reloading the same pathetic attempts to ""luck out"" without pulling my hair out of my scalp.After 20 plus hours of this anxiety attack inducing frustration I dialed it down to Nightmare and have been progressing at a steady rate. I am totally addicted to the game when it comes to fps combat and enemy commentary. I find myself giggling as much the last time I heard ""Hey he killed what's-his-name!"" as I did the first. I have found most of the weapons have a direct purpose at least once, and the art style is somewhat of a favorite of mine.The downsides I have noticed as a current player of at least mediocre knowledge of the game would definitely include the racing controls and overall uselessness of most weapons in the game. I am not using a gamepad so maybe that contributes to my problem, but it seems like the more I upgrade my cars the worse they perform. Every situation I use the car in (combat races, open world, time trial, etc) the car seems to perform differently. I assume there is some form of scaling invovled in different scenarios, but I don't know if that's true. Either way it keeps me from grasping a familiarity with the vehicle I have invested in, and takes away from the overall level of enjoyment when it comes to racing. Once I have the story mode racing achievements finished I'll probably avoid it all together on future playthroughs.The weapon selection is farily decent for a standard single player game of this kind. The problem for me is that even on Nightmare (and Ultra Nightmare for a short time) I find myself using four guns. Two of them for all average encounters and two of them for special ones. I used standard buckshot in the shotgun and steel tipped bolts in the crossbow in every fight I find myself in. Crossbow is for human combat, and the shotgun is for mutant combat. I never bother with anything else leaving most of my weapons forever ammo capped. In circumstances out of the norm I use the double barrel shotgun (Anarchy DLC ftw) armed with Pop Rockets, and the pistol armed with Fat Mamas or Killstrikes. The double barrel with Pop Rockets takes down any large scale boss or DLC related special mutants in seconds, and the pistol with said custom ammo destroys armored humans in a similar fashion after I shoot off their helmet using the crossbow. Perhaps my experience will change once I reach the end of the story and battle the Authority, but that has yet to be discovered. I find the automatic rifles to be ammo dumps that destroy my accuracy overall, and even with armor piercing rounds just feel totally underwhelming. The nailgun fits into that category as well, and I haven't used it since I finished the achievements related to it. I know its ammo is retrieveable (rebar only), but so are crossbow bolts that don't take 4 seconds to reload.The crafting system is keeping me interested until I have all the schematics aquired. I mostly only use it for turrets (still trying to kill 5 enemies for the Steam achievement and will probably have to do this on normal difficulty) and lock grinders for obvious reasons. I only spend four more dollars on bandages if I just buy them compared to buying the pieces (Crimson Elite armor from Anarchy DLC ftw) and after earning $40,000 at the poker machine 4 bucks just isn't all that much compared to crafting time. So basically the best part of this system is crafting my pistol ammo. Kudos for putting a crafting system in, but 90 percent of the time I'll just skip it.Multiplayer in RAGE seems like an afterthought. I generally don't get too invovled in fps multiplayer modes due to general lack of interest, but in RAGE the coop was very fun for a few days. The voice chat feature worked great and saved me from needing to be on my Mumble client. My friend and I cleared everything on both difficulites except three missions. We never finished the Bash TV episodes on Nightmare (good God), and due to an end level glitch we could not finish Grab and Go on Nightmare.Also, where are all the people for the races? Even on the f2p weekend I saw no one on it. We sat for quite a while and I tried solo que a few times with no luck. Two Steam achievements I won't get unless I get two more people on my friends list who have the game and we just que up with four of us. C'mon now...so many in game badges based on the multiplayer races and no one is attempting it? Requiring four people before I can even launch the race keeps us forever alone. Seems like a waste to me, but then again maybe I just missed the golden era for this games racing mode.After almost 40 hours in my playthrough (I take my time and try not to miss anything...the first playthrough is the most important to me) I already know I will at some point play this through again. Most likely on Ultra for the achievement and normal to clean up any missed achievements after that. This game offers much more than some folks would have you believe as long as you can get past the occasional pop in and fairly standard story line. I would definitely invest in future DLC or anytihng related to this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE presents the most solid FPS experience to date, the controls are perfect, smooth and plays out just how you'd want them to, which isn't suprising considering ID software is the father of the FPS genre. They try to expand the genre by adding vehicular combat, and some RPG elements, but unfortually, these aspects of the game, while not entirely bad, dont compete with the FPS portions of the game.

												Got to admit, this game is really fun. The story is nice, graphics are great, the atmosphere of the game really makes you wanna ""stick around"". The gameplay and game mehanics are really diverse and it is full of extra activities like races, finger fillet and all sorts of gambling,The only thing that I dont really like about the game is that is short. It feels like the game has all the elements to be a big game ... but it isn't.

												Awesome game!!! It looks like if Fallout and Borderlands had a baby. Finally, driving vehicles is possible and enjoyable! (Not like freaking mouse steering ""shtako"" in Borderlands.) The interaction with NPCs, the quests, the minigames, the easter eggs, the wingsticks - AWESOME. Dealing with enemies is just fun. You can collect or buy parts and build your own turrets, bots, RC bomb-cars... I just wanted the game be bigger, because you obviously want the good things last longer. The ending is just... Ending - and that's it. But it is not about the ending, it's about the journey... 100% recommendation. As a huge fan, I had to have the Anarchy edition too. And yes I also have the Scorchers DLC which was worth buying. SPOILER: Don't expect any nasty things with Sarah... ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty good FPS. Great mechanics and graphics. Ending could have been better as far as the ""boss fight"" goes.One day, you wake up from your capsule and saved by a local from the bandits. You make your way through the main quest, which is mostly linear, by travelling with various vehicles. The game has fantastic gameplay, graphics, and a decent story. The ending was largely disappointing though. I knew that the final mission was the final mission, but the ending was still very sudden and not as difficult as other ""boss"" fights. I mean, at one point, you fight a giant monster with just rocket launchers and only have a small room to navigate through, while the giant monster is outisde a gaping hole in the wall. The game certainly has its ""wow"" moments, and there are neat side things to do, like racing and delivery quests, but the main story could have used a little bit of work.The setting is fantastic though, the world design is great for the coloring and character. It's semi open world, as in you could explore the every corner, but the main missions are the priority. After a while, you go to a different area and you can tell how vastly destroyed and different it is in the color pallets, it's clear that id games put a lot of work in the design.8.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like racing and FPS then you should definitely get this game. It has a lot of shooting, different items like grenades etc. and many different missions/quests. Also, if you get this you should get the Scorcher's DLC as well. It's for sure worth it. You'll know why;D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Actually, this game not so bad with singleplayer, it has great animation and game graphical, but color with the camera angle will make you dizzy, headaches and even sick, that is very awfully one of parts.Second worst is vulgar stories, boring task and  you even can't use your bullet headshot the enemy. If you really love the Borderlands, you may feel this game copied Borderlands.So I suggest you don't have too much expectations with this, although metascore give it a high score of 79 points.P.S. The multiplayer almost entirely dead.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a spoilerfree review of the entire game played in singeplayer at pretty much 100% on normal difficulty. This was fun, there is many titles out there that do many things better, but this still was a nice enough game. The post-apocalyptic setting justifies for some mindless shoot people action. The game would have been a lot better as a cover-based shooter. The way it is you basically guess if cover is high enough not to get shot. The quests arent very memorable. Its pretty muh always ""shoot enemy type x do thing a come back"" While the characters did have a lot of personality none of them where very memorable. There is a small variety of minigames and sidestuff to do, play a cardgame, make cool jumps, participate in a race, allthough that one can become important since you get to most places via car and races are pretty much the only way to earn points to upgrade your car.  The weapons arent anything special either. Shotgun, crossbow, 2 types of machinegun, pistol (seriously who uses that thing once you get the other qeapons?) sniper rifle, rocket launcher and later minigun, some of them with multple types of ammunition. What it boils down to though is that you either use the shotgun or the sniper rifle. The only reason to not use the sniper rifle is if melee enemys are rushing towards you. Seriously, why bother with rocketlaunchers when a few good sniper shoots to the head kill any boss just as well? The crossbow is for a stealth approach in theory, but this suffers from 2 problems: Half of the time the enemies are already waiting for you and later on in the game the crossbow doesnt oneshot anymore, therefor rendering it useless for stealth. You can also craft some cool items, like an explosive RC car, a spiderlike killer robot (just like the sniper you need not bother with anything else once it is upgraded) and others. The races are all managable but require multiple tries sometimes. The story itself is nothing you havent seen or heard of before and mainly serves to connect one place you shoot people at with other places you shoot people at. The soundtrack gets the job done, particularly since its drowned in gunfire half the time anyway. The only soundtrack that stands out is the credit song (that I think is also the theme song? I dont know I always started the game before it had a chance to start playing)There are two main weaknesses: 1: a lack of maps. Half the time a map would have been really really helpful. Particularly in areas like the city where it at least took me a while to finally figure out where everything was leading to frustrated running in circles. The missions themself are so linear and leave so little room for exploration that a missing map usually isnt a problem though. 2; That ending. As I said spoilerfree so here is the main problem: There is a huge buildup. You get the freaking minigun and the special ""BFG-Ammo"" with it. Sounds like a hell of a fight doesnt it? I even used up all the money I had left on ammo and bandages (health potions). What actually happens is that you gun done a couple of goons and boom done. Not even a boss. I dont even know what the BFG ammo looks like because I saved it up for something epic. Im not even saying that I think the story should have gone on more, just a boss even if its a little one, would have been very nice. The goons you gun down arent even all that hard to beat, I used a total of 1 bandage. The game had many harder sections than this.Still I recomend this game. Why? Because its fun. It is fun running face to face towards the enemy and pumping a shotgun round in their heads to watch them flying. It is fun picking them off one by one with the sniper. It is fun running around wreaking havoc in your car. At least it is to me. I dont think this game should have been much longer though because the fighting is growing rather stale over time.

Posted: February 21, 2014
												RAGE is one of the greatest flops that I have seen in video games, but it is still blows my mind every time I play it. RAGE is a first person shooter! A lot of people don’t seem to understand that, but it has been pretty clear from the start. This is NOT another Fallout or Borderlands! I don’t understand where everybody keeps getting this from. RAGE differs from Doom 3 in the fact that there are “safe” areas and the main world map has opened up a little bit giving you freedom and a break from shooting stuff with your shotgun, but at the heart of things it is still a FPS.Pros: Rage was created by id software meaning that the shooting is superb. Every weapon just feels good and sounds like it should. Wingsticks: The wingstick is the best weapon in the game. It is essentially an offhand quick use weapon that is a sharp boomerang of decapitations.Mega Textures: Id Tech 5 uses mega textures which make the game look gorgeous (when you are far away). Driving around in your armed buggy outside in the wasteland looks amazing and has a great feel to it.Water: The water in RAGE looks really good. There is not a whole lot of it and there is no swimming, but it does look good.Memorable Characters: The townsfolk that you run into are often a bit goofy like they stared at the sun too long, but they stick in your head.Enemy Mobility: The enemies in RAGE are very agile (especially the mutants) and often climb on the walls or ceiling or are jumping over a rail or down a floor. Other “Weapons”: There is more to RAGE than the shotgun (though the shotgun is always a good bet) there are items that you can “build” such as the sentry turret or bot and use them to help you out on your journey.DLC: If you are liking RAGE get the DLC and play it after you finish the game, since it gives a better ending.Cons:Mega Textures: The down side of mega textures is when you are close up. If you go up to a soup can on the self it is all but a blur. There are some resources that can help to make this problem better, but it can only get so good due to the lack of higher quality texture file released by id.Texture Popping: Basically you have a higher texture quality popping into place when you turn around in the game. This is a fairly common issue among lower end computers, and can be a primary reason to not play this game. There are some fixes for this but generally if you have a higher computer it won’t be an issue. Note: AMD cards have been known to have performance issues, but I haven’t experienced this. Saves: The auto save feature in RAGE is all but broke. Don’t rely on it. Save your game whenever you want manually… Simple as that.Story/Game World: The story of the game started out pretty good, but went downhill quite quickly. I felt like you are the only person in the game world that can do anything, and things like money are only there for you to use. The world is fairly static and default jump height doesn’t allow you to jump up on boxes or crates.Ending: RAGE is essentially the first part in a two part story/game and the ending shows it. The ending makes since, but ultimately it is a letdown.At the end of the day I really like RAGE and think that it is a great game, though it has been overlooked because of these issues. Hopefully id can fix this stuff and produce an amazing Doom 4, but we will have to wait and see. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone that likes FPS games and to pick it up with the DLC when it is on sale.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is frustrating at first, but it promotes the use of some of the more unusual ammo (rebars, pop rockets, kill-bursts) which makes for a way better experience.

												Rage is fantastic! It was automatically in my game favorites within the first 10 minutes of gameplay. This game is like Borderlands meets Fallout with a bunch of other game love sprinkled in. It features explosive post apocolyptic shooter style gameplay with races, minigames, and  a ton of secret items to find. Oh and did I mention crafting and upgrades? This is serious business! Although the baddies are hilarious. Definitely a must play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The story on my part was amazing I liked how their were side quest aswell and you could buy a good amount of guns like nail guns and more, but the better part of this game is the  GRAPHICS  they are purely amazing and stunning.I really spent tons of time in this game 16.4 hours and that was with school, this game was worth all my time, but as all games they come and go and I ended my road a long time ago.I highly reccommend playing this for this is when I realized that Steam was worth it. 10/10 Would play a sequel ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is quite scenic and has a lot of character. The NPCs are interesting. Combat, economy, side quests, etc. all good. I made it as far as Wellspring, where I needed to get guns for my buggy to continue the storyline, and getting guns required me to win races with said buggy. This is where I hit a wall, literally and figuratively. The driving pretty much put an end to the game for me. At first with the keyboard, I did pretty well with the ATV, but the buggy was absolute crap. I tried my Logitech joystick, which has given me many hours of driving enjoyment... well, I had to use joy2key to make it work. And, again, driving the buggy was crap. I spent as much time in reverse to extricate myself from an obstacle as I did in forward. So I pulled out a controller. Again, driving the buggy was just not driving well (slightly better than the joystick). Additionally, the controller is just not comfortable because I haven't really used one much since the Atari 2600 days.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												===Note: The Steam Review Police are trying to keep me down and limit my text, so like half of this review is in the comments===4 years ago, I purchased RAGE. It was $30, and this was back when a game dropping to $30 within the year of its release was a deal of a lifetime and not an everyday occurrence on GMG, so I thought it was a great deal. I had heard the horror stories of its launch regarding things like ATI and general pop-in issues, but I figured enough time had passed that those bugs had been worked out. And they had, for the most part, but that wasn't why RAGE became one of my most regretted purchases on Steam. But instead of reviewing the game as I remember it, I decided to replay it just to articulate everything that I found wrong with RAGE.First off, if you have two or more monitors and your primary isn't on the left, RAGE is going to default to try launching on your left monitor. It doesn't matter how big or small it is, or if it's set as your primary monitor (which is what most sensible games launch to); it's going to make it fit until you get in and tell it not to. The engine is also locked at 60 FPS, so if you're like me and have a nice 144 hz monitor and want to get the most of it then you should go somewhere else. But enough technical nitpicking - what about the game?Well first off, I should mention the graphics, because it's obligatory that whenever someone mentions RAGE they have to talk about the graphics because that's the only memorable thing in this game. I could sit here and laugh at how bad the texture pop-in is, or how low resolution the textures are for hours, but I actually can't because I hit the text limit that I didn't know steam reviews had, so instead I'm just going to just leave you these videos I recorded throughout the last few days, and screenshots to accompany them, so you can laugh at them yourself. Just let me know when you're done so I can continue - they're compressed to 720p, but they still demonstrate the effects enough. These are all recorded and screenshotted on a GTX 970 with an i5 3570k overclocked to 4.4 GHz.http://puu.sh/jvyNH/9ed9b1eb9f.mp4http://puu.sh/jvOqm/6589f38244.mp4

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=499374777http://imgur.com/a/Qmc3xSee, the thing about RAGE's graphics is that they look great when you're outside, but the game's interiors pretty much universally look like garbage from a game from 2004. Of particular note is that the game has no dynamic lighting that I could see, so instead of giving you a flashlight or something they just made all the darkness the color green, which just makes it look even uglier. Thankfully, this also has the unexpected side effect of making the pop-in not very noticeable, because even if the textures haven't popped in at all you won't be able to tell if it's using placeholders or if that's just how the game looks. What you will notice, however, is how barren the world feels. The items that can be picked up have a noticeable contrast in texture quality with the rest of the world, and since RAGE is a game where you're expected to search every nook and cranny to find said objects, there's no excuse for said nooks and crannies to look so completely awful. Nothing else in any given level can generally be interacted with - you can't break bottles, you can't push chairs, you get the idea; it feels like the entire map is just one big model that you're moving through, and combined with the total lack of any dynamic lighting it makes the interior environments feel extremely dull. Oh, but what's that you say? You want to know about the wasteland itself? The one you've seen so many beautiful scenic screenshots about? Well, the problem is that those are just that - they're scenic wastelands that you drive through, take a screenshot of, and drive past. And that's a good thing, because even if you're outside and you get too close to a rock, or look down, the graphics just don't hold up. Now, regarding the pop-in demonstrated above there is a config that you can put in your launch options to remove it (supposedly, that is - I didn't try it, since I wanted the ""full RAGE experience""). The catch? It requires a GPU with at least 3 GB of VRAM. For a game in 2011, this is unacceptable. For a game that looks like it was made in 2004, this is laughable. But with all that, the graphics aren't even the real flaw of RAGE. As I said before, the interiors of the game are generally extremely ugly and bland. But while you might think that doesn't matter because of how much you've heard about the wasteland, the fact is that about 80% of the game takes place in those ugly interiors. For all you've heard about the wasteland overworld, it's essentially one big kodak moment, made for you to take a screenshot of on your way to the next interior. The wasteland is essentially just a big race track from one place to another, and you'll notice that feeling if you decide to play it. RAGE, despite its appearance, is an extremely linear game. Every  area in the game is either blocked off or locked until it's time to go there in a story mission, and half the time once you finish in said area, it locks off again, meaning there's plenty of missable content to be had because that's what gamers want in modern games. They don't even do a particularly good job of blocking the areas off - sometimes paths are just obstructed by almost waist-high blockades that you just can't jump over. Like these.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497667786http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497667076Furthering the linearity is that you aren't allowed to pick up weapons from the ground until you're at the point where you're ""supposed"" to obtain a particular weapon, even if it's a weapon that you do find later on. I can understand why we can't pick up a fallen enemy's assault rifle which is visually different from any of the ones you obtain. I can't understand why I can't pick up this shotgun, which was lying beside the person I killed.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=497668166Except while I don't understand it, I do know exactly why I couldn't pick it up - it was because that person was in the area where I was doing a side quest that was all but forced into my hands. The reward for the quest in question was a combat shotgun - not that exact combat shotgun, but the same combat shotgun, except it was blessed with the almighty quest reward status. That's the extent of the linearity of this game.So what about the actual levels, then? What are they like? Well, for the most part they're pretty much just the winding linear corridors you would expect from a standard-fare FPS. There are little bits and bobs that you can pick up to craft doodads and then immediately forget about, and every now and then there will be a neat secret that references Wolfenstein or Quake or something else to remind you that you could be playing a game where you can actually have fun right now. Each level involves running to the other end, grabbing the thing that the person who gave you the quest wanted you to grab, and then leaving through the new convenient exit that wasn't accessible from the beginning. Then if you're feeling really dangerous, you can go to the ""sidequest board"" and get a ""sidequest"", which basically involves going back through that exit, going back through the same level backwards, and grabbing another thing for some other person. One or two of the ""sidequests"" are particularly risky and try to break the mold and put you in a little cage and have you snipe mutants while defending a bunch of idiots. ===CONTINUED IN THE COMMENTS===			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is one of those shooters that either you like it or hate it, honestly the only reason why I tried it is because I love borderlands and this looked so similar that I had to try it and hey I was not disappointed it may not be as big as borderlands nor have that many weapons but in it still has that touch you know..all I'm gonna say is that it felt a bit short and the graphics problem where they don't render till you look at them really bothered me but besides that its great.I would give it a 7/10 definitely get it in Sale.

												If you are a looking for a postapolyptic fast 'n' solid id Software First Person Shooter combined with entertaining car combat races (like in Mad Max or Death Race) and a whiff of RPG-elements like crafting, RAGE could be worth a look.Don't expect a Borderlands or even an open world Fallout 3 - There is a lot of wasted potential, the story is thin and the id Tech 5 Engine is not well optimized:There are annoying texture popups and ugly environment textures (but awesome character textures...). You can find some .ini-tweaks online, which will improve the texture size, but it's sad enough you can't just adjust it in the graphic options.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												age combines all the things we've come to expect from an id FPS with some Fallout stylings thrown in for good measure. The art direction is fantastic, and the intro cutscene was unexpectedly moving.Multiplayer is presented through neat little flashback narratives, and I'm looking forward to playing through more of them. There's also a multiplayer racing mode that I haven't yet checked out.The vehicle sections and minigames are good diversions, and it's nice to see some of the stock weapons enhanced through upgrades.It's just a shame that the last third of the game feels comparatively unfinished and the finale seems to be missing. Don't expect any kind of story or gameplay conclusions.That said, Rage is still a solid, enjoyable FPS with old school style gameplay, as well as decent arcade racing shooter.First two thirds of the game: 10/10Everything from about halfway through the Gaining Influence mission onwards: 4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is a game from Id Software, one of the most iconic game developers of all time; Id is responsible for classics like Doom, Wolfenstein and Quake, and are a household name amongst the gaming community. Rage was pretty highly anticipated before its release, and the game itself created a pretty divisive fanbase.Rage is set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland as a result of a meteorite collision with Earth. This makes for an environment made up of rocky canyons, dusty valleys and dark caves. This setting has been done quite a few times before, but the various gameplay mechanics and impressive use of visuals means that the world is rather nice to explore.You navigate a moderately open world, similar to the first Borderlands. Using a wide array of guns with various ammo types, you'll collect quests from a hub, find the location in the world, complete the quest; rinse and repeat. The missions don't really have much variety as you'll often be completing the same tasks, consisting of killing mutants and bandits to get some item or pickup. Despite this however, the game will make up for it with some surprisingly solid shooting, and enjoyable racing mechanics.The variety of guns definitely works in the game's favour. There are revolvers, assault rifles, shotguns, bazookas, plasma rifles, wingsticks, remote-control bomb cars, grenades, crossbows and sniper rifles. Not many games give you this many guns and I commend the game for doing so. The shooting itself is quite tight and responsive, with all of the weapons handling quite well. Enemy AI is also rather excellent; the enemies leap and sidestep around the levels to avoid your attacks, and it made the shooting really enjoyable and entertaining.The game's best asset is probably the racing. With different tracks and game modes, Rage allows you to use modified racing cars to face off against other foes from around the wasteland. You can upgrade your cars with missles and machine guns, and this made for genuinely interesting moments of the game. The 'Mad Max' feel the game was obviously aiming for was really noticed her, and was one of the more addictive/memorable parts of the game.Rage is a fun experience due to the sharp visuals, polished shooting and awesome racing. With little to no story and unmemorable characters, it is difficult to get invested in this game. If you enjoy mindless shooting and racing with visual flair, Rage will probably satisfy you. 7 / 10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is smooth, which is as it should be with any game coming from Carmack. I was very impressed with the game's technical execution, BUT the substance of the game is lacking, unfortunately. At the time of my playthrough, I believe I had already played tons of hours in Borderlands, which I had also already beaten, so it really felt like a clone of that experience. RAGE definitely has more in-your-face moments than the aforementioned game, which I would characterize as one of the main drawbacks of Borderlands seeing as I could defeat just about any outpost by utilizing ranged (sniping) tactics. RAGE, on the other hand,has more realistic graphics, which comes as a plus basically because there were more visual ""WOW"" moments over BL. But at the gameplay level, which boils down to movement and shooting accuracy, the two games are virtually identical. Also, I completed RAGE much quicker then BL, why I'm not entirely sure.. maybe because I was used to the gameplay style via BL, or maybe it was somewhat less challenging seeing that most of the encounters were close-up, trying to surprise me -- which was a lesson previously taught by Doom 3 by the way. Overall, I would have to not recommend this game if you have played Borderlands, which came out before this, so...y'know. Otherwise, I give it my full recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was actually in rage when this game came out. It was full of glitches and id software released a game with barely any graphics options to choose from in the main menu. Websites popped-up around the net to provide advice as to how to change the graphics settings by modifying the game's cfg file. I hated this - this was not user friendly and also even to check small changes you needed to quit and relaunch the game again and again.After a while some patches were released and corrected these issues of the game. RAGE, by the way, has a very mediocre story and in my opinion Bethesda being the publisher here did not help the case. You are a survivor after an asteroid almost completely annihilates mankind. Just before the catastrophe a handful of people - scientists, soldiers and other high rank personnel - were frozen and put in a so-called ark that was taken below ground levels. Many years after the event you wake up as your ark automatically hits the surface. You realise everybody else from your team perished and you are the sole survivor. You are immediately attacked by mutants and then saved by a stranger. He takes you to his settlement and the game practically starts.There are several small towns where you can interact with a lot of people. There are dozens of side missions to complete and a couple of minigames, as well. So, as opposed to what we got used to in previous id software games RAGE now follows a non-linear path. Completing sidemissions earns you money which you can use to purchase new weapons or upgrades to your equipment. In addition to this there are races you can participate in. You have your own vehicle and beside the races you can use this to go from one town to the next. I liked how smoothly the developers completed this - transitioning from the FPS perspective to the camera-behind-the-car view happens smoothly. There are really no loading times; getting in and out of your vehicle happens fast.There are two things where RAGE shines, in my opinion:1) Art design: Some of the places you venture through look amazing. An example: You need to go to Dead City to acquire an object. You climb narrow steps in-between huge, collapsed multistorey buildings. You truly get the feeling of a post-apocalyptic setting here. You race in vast wastelands, go down to the sewers to eradicate mutants, participate in a mutant reality show, go through deadly caves in the Scorchers DLC etc. Textures could have been more of high quality nature, still, the game's art design compensates for this.2) Combat: I loved Doom and Quake for their weapons. And how good it was to eliminate waves of enemies. RAGE delivers the very same experience. Enemies hide behind cover and they react realistically: headshots do count and in case you shoot them in the leg they stumble and fall. Some run at you with clubs only and you think it is easy to get rid of them but you realise that you cannot hit them: they do somersault and jump on and off walls and drive you mad. Also, all weapons are valuable. Remember how quickly we stopped using a pistol in Doom? As the minigun used the same ammunition. Or simply because weapons obtained later on were more efficient. In RAGE each weapon has different ammunition types and some upgrades, as well. Believe it or not - the pistol is one of the strongest weapons in the hands of a good shooter. You can craft a very strong bullet that can easily eliminate bigger foes with some good aimed headshots.RAGE can remind gamers of old-school shooters. If you look at it like that you can enjoy this game from start to finish. I am not saying my expectations weren't higher for an id game but following my initial disappointment I gradually came to like this game. Although the story is mediocre and the game has a disappointing end and a short DLC, it is a highly recommended FPS game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage un juego que inesperadamente me ha sorprendido. Shooter, carreras, minijuegos de cartas, cuchillos, dados y el Bash TV concurso de televisión en donde tienes que ir superando hordas de mutantes. Un juego completo sin duda alguna.No consideraría el juego como ""mundo abierto"" por las barreras invisibles y por la facilidad del camino a seguir durante las misiones. La ambientación post-apocalíptica, los efectos de sonido, los movimientos de los enemigos, las armas y sus variantes como diferentes municiones, el robot araña, los coches teledirigidos, la sensación de como te va envolviendo el juego, todo esto ha cumplido con creces mis expectativas del juego. Y por decir algo negativo pues mencionar que la última misión y como ha terminado la campaña no ha sido del todo muy sorprendente pero bueno todo lo demás compensa.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												AWSOME!!I looked for something like this for a long time!Classic post-apocalypse setting, without zombies, too mutch futurism and too mutch realism, and not cartoonish (like Borderlands for example). Rusty cars with spikes and miniguns, gangs of punky-savage-biker mad raiders, scavenging and crafting, vews of desert, destroyed towns, abandoned post-industrial buildings... This game has everything that I wanna see when I say ""post-apocalypse""! It's true Mad Max style, car-oriented, I call it ""PostaPunk"", that is vary rare now.This is what I expected, when I first started Borderlands (I like Border too, but it's just not what I looked for).Yeah, the game has it's flaws: it's too corridor, sometimes there are same models for diferent characters, it's pretty short.. but the whole atmosphere is just too awsome!+ Custom post-apocalypse cars+ Road gangs+ Crafting+ Save when you want! + So beautiful rocks and abandoned towns!+ True Mad Max atmosphere- Too corridor- Too short! Need MORE!!100 interceptors of 10!!One of the best games I played in my f*** life! (And I'm playing since early 90-s)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was actually in rage when this game came out. It was full of glitches and id software released a game with barely any graphics options to choose from in the main menu. Websites popped-up around the net to provide advice as to how to change the graphics settings by modifying the game's cfg file. I hated this - this was not user friendly and also even to check small changes you needed to quit and relaunch the game again and again.After a while some patches were released and corrected these issues of the game. RAGE, by the way, has a very mediocre story and in my opinion Bethesda being the publisher here did not help the case. You are a survivor after an asteroid almost completely annihilates mankind. Just before the catastrophe a handful of people - scientists, soldiers and other high rank personnel - were frozen and put in a so-called ark that was taken below ground levels. Many years after the event you wake up as your ark automatically hits the surface. You realise everybody else from your team perished and you are the sole survivor. You are immediately attacked by mutants and then saved by a stranger. He takes you to his settlement and the game practically starts.There are several small towns where you can interact with a lot of people. There are dozens of side missions to complete and a couple of minigames, as well. So, as opposed to what we got used to in previous id software games RAGE now follows a non-linear path. Completing sidemissions earns you money which you can use to purchase new weapons or upgrades to your equipment. In addition to this there are races you can participate in. You have your own vehicle and beside the races you can use this to go from one town to the next. I liked how smoothly the developers completed this - transitioning from the FPS perspective to the camera-behind-the-car view happens smoothly. There are really no loading times; getting in and out of your vehicle happens fast.There are two things where RAGE shines, in my opinion:1) Art design: Some of the places you venture through look amazing. An example: You need to go to Dead City to acquire an object. You climb narrow steps in-between huge, collapsed multistorey buildings. You truly get the feeling of a post-apocalyptic setting here. You race in vast wastelands, go down to the sewers to eradicate mutants, participate in a mutant reality show, go through deadly caves in the Scorchers DLC etc. Textures could have been more of high quality nature, still, the game's art design compensates for this.2) Combat: I loved Doom and Quake for their weapons. And how good it was to eliminate waves of enemies. RAGE delivers the very same experience. Enemies hide behind cover and they react realistically: headshots do count and in case you shoot them in the leg they stumble and fall. Some run at you with clubs only and you think it is easy to get rid of them but you realise that you cannot hit them: they do somersault and jump on and off walls and drive you mad. Also, all weapons are valuable. Remember how quickly we stopped using a pistol in Doom? As the minigun used the same ammunition. Or simply because weapons obtained later on were more efficient. In RAGE each weapon has different ammunition types and some upgrades, as well. Believe it or not - the pistol is one of the strongest weapons in the hands of a good shooter. You can craft a very strong bullet that can easily eliminate bigger foes with some good aimed headshots.RAGE can remind gamers of old-school shooters. If you look at it like that you can enjoy this game from start to finish. I am not saying my expectations weren't higher for an id game but following my initial disappointment I gradually came to like this game. Although the story is mediocre and the game has a disappointing end and a short DLC, it is a highly recommended FPS game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage an example of an amazing corridor FPS(its an 'open world' filled with corridors and the 'open world is another huge corridor linking all the smaller corridors together), it offers a very different experience of corridor shooters, by giving me the choice to continue on with the story or to hang around doing side missions and races, many other linear games does not have this feature, they make you go on without giving you a break, thats why I didn't get bored playing this game.This game is a shiny gem among other linear games, theres some great weapons to use, and I mean it, every single weapon is unique, and each has different ammo types to apply. The game even employs a decent crafting system, u can craft some items like meds to heal or bombs and stuff like that to kill your enemies with different styles. There are few types of enemy in this game, mainly u kill anything that moves, make use of your weapons, there is so many approach to killing besides shooting.The graphics are beautiful from far, it's like a painting come alive, but up close its terrible, its so blurry that u can compare it to the graphics of the 1st Half-Life game. The driving is a bit off, it just doesnt seem real, banging a wall at full speed and u get a little knock back and thats it. I must say the ending fight is kinda lame, I saved a lot of bullets for the boss fight I imagined would be tough, but instead its just dissapointingly easy, its the lamest♥♥♥♥♥♥I've ever seen, they decided to keep the story hanging there, so there will be a sequel to this. I just hope they improve everything, this game has lots of potential but not enough content.Overall I think that it's definitely worth your time and your money, get it on a sale			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												  RAGE is a unique experience in the post-apocolyptic genre. It's got gunfights! It's got scaveging/crafting!  It's got... Racing!  What it is, foremost, is a fast-paced FPS, and it does this quite well with a wide selection of weapons and enemies that make you work to put them down.  After the introduction you are left to explore or thrust yourself into the first quest.    ""But I thought you said this is a FPS!""  It is, the story is driven in a nonlinear-linear fashion.  Which I thought was a brilliant way to let me decide how I want to play the game.  When I'm not busy running for cover, deciding what weapon (of which there is a plethora of options if you take into consideration the different ammos available for wach gun) would be most effective in the current combat situation, or scavenging for items, I found myself appreciating the the work put into making each location truely unique and beautiful.  It was refreshing to be emmersed in a post-apocolyptic world that is desolate, and at the same time rich in color.  It's too bad that there are inconsistances that broke me out of the trance:      For some reason random areas of both the world and level maps would just not be accessable due to some invisible barrier.  ""Why can I jump on top of this flaming trashcan but not the the short stack of tires right next to it!""    Found myself in the heat of a firefight and taking cover to change to a certain weapon/ammo selection.  The act of getting to the right type of ammo or crafting a few things would sometimes take longer then the battle.  ""Let's take a five mutants/raiders/authority soldiers!  I'm not ready yet!""  Overall I found the game very fun and emmersive.  I suggest waiting for the game to go on sale to buy though.  It's a blast, but not $20 worth of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is an odd game.Don't get me wrong, it's pretty darned fun, but it feels unfinished, which is uncharacteristic of id.It looks gorgeous from a distance, but up close, the megatexture technology displays its weakness and ends up making every texture in the game look muddy.There's still that odd moment when turning where the engine takes a microsecond longer to render textures in your peripheral vision.For a world that invites exploration, it's remarkably linear, even down to your character not being able to jump over knee-high obstacles.And the abrupt ending is one of the worst in gaming.Still, the shooting and movement possess that unique id solidity, even down to strafe-jumping working like it does in Q3. And the character models and animation are sublime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Solid shooter, though you deal a lot with bullet-sponge enemies, or enemies of the same variant. Interface is very poorly designed for a mouse and keyboard. Very little difficulty curve, and the game more or less just dumps a ton of upgrades on you without even trying.Driving is okay, but is limited mostly to races which get boring very quickly. All the upgrades aren't really necessary for survival.Completed first playthrough focusing on side-quests and got 10 hours out of it. Bought it for $20, and would not recommend purchasing for anything more than that. Felt like iD was going for a very broad, Borderlands-esque shooter with about 30 hours of content, but ran out of time and shortened it considerably. The game ends when you feel like it just gets going.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Please note that this review is a little biased, since I bought the game on sale for 5$, and for 5$ it is a damn near perfect. But I will try to judge it if I got it full priced. Rage is pretty much a odd wannabee post apocalyptic middle child. It seems to have broken into the house of Fallout and Mad Max, but didn't have enough time and only managed to steal a few things. It got the vehicle combat done quite well, and the enviroments look very stunning, even playing in 2016. Though combat gets a bit repetitive at times, the game can't seem to decide if it wants to be a run and gun, or a ""next gen"" cover based shooter. Though the guns feel new and fresh, it seems every enemy has a copious amount of health. But even through that, I played on the highest difficulty and only died twice thoughout my entire playthough, once when I got bombarted by 3 rocket launcher dudes, and once when I tested to see if you could exit your car mid jump. Unfortunately when Rage broke into Fallout's house it forgot to take the open world aspect, maybe its sneak wasnt high enough. Also if you buy this game, don't buy it for the plot, the plot is basically a really bad chinese knock off, diet, watered down version of Fallout 3. But buy it for being Mad Max with rocket lauchers strapped to your car. All together for 5$- 8/10Full priced- maybe 6/10Final note: you may of encountered spelling mistakes and gammaical errors in my review, I could say that english is not my frst language, but it is. I really couldnt give a Mel Gibson about it.  Final final note: I do have a bone to pick with the pick up noise. Every time you pick up a collectiable it makes the sound of gun cocking, and every single time I think there is a baddie behind me. I guess thats what cs does to you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is a lot to like about this game.  A nice, vibrant post-apocalyptic world, even if it does have weird western and steampunk elements, nice guns that all feel different to use, have great animations and sounds.  The crafting system is simple, not tedius.  And the driving was just enough, not too much especially for someone who prefers shooters over drivers, so this didn't wear on me, which was nice.The basic plotline of a survivor of a near ELE brought awakening into a nightmarish world years after being put into cryo sleep is not unique, but works well enough.  The first part of the game is just doing odd jobs to get things.  Most of those odd jobs involve brutal murder, but hey, it's the world you're in, right?  Unfortunately, the plot is purely driven by the NPC's in the same mold as the Half-Life series, you never utter a single word, there are no cut scenes to drive plot.  So, effectively you have to take the word of these people you just met, that murdering 100s of people is the right thing to do.  Of course, everyone shoots on sight.  But when strangers are constantly conspiring to murder you, who wouldn't?The story goes down hill once The Resistance is brought into it.  Yes, another story with a Resistance, which is fighting against an evil, oppresive and technologically superior supressor power.  This trope is so over used, that it has lost all meaning.  What starts as an interesting survival in the post-apocalyptic wasteland soon becomes the same as every other resistance storyline ever done.  And whilst the gameplay is fun, the story lacks immersion and anything that you'll remember a day after completion.There is no explanation given as to how, in such a desloate landscape, such technology is freely available to the bad guys.  It just is.  There are some nice moments of horror in the game, going through Dead City especially.  Some good FPS battles, and each of the enemy types you come up against does have some nice and unique feel to them.  Mutants, the different bandit tribes, the Authority, The Gearheads etc.  They all look, fight and feel authentic, meaning that even though there is a lot of shoot XYZ, the combat never seems to drag.  It's rare that you end up fighting the same kind of foe more than 1 or 2 missions in a row.Ultimately, i thoroughly enjoyed this game, and even though i got it on special, i'd have been happy to pay full price.4/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game...but barely. I actually sort of got interested into trying it after playing through The New Order earlier this year, even though the games don't have a lot in common other than their engine...which most people don't care for. Anyways, figured I'd give one of id's only ""recent"" games a try. Rage doesn't know what it wants to be. I guess that's a common criticism so I'm not breaking new ground here. At a surface level, it looks reminiscent of Fallout 3, with a similar setting and even a rudimentary quest structure. However, this game is clearly an FPS and not an RPG. It also has vehicle traversal, even including racing and time trials. This wasn't what I was looking for going in, so outside of using the vehicles to go from objective to objective, it wasn't something I put a lot of time into. So I pretty much played this as a straight FPS, to the extent I could. I was instantly soured at the layout of the game. You are fairly readily given the ability to explore the Wasteland, which while not a sprawling overworld that you can really get lost in, it does have some size to it and I was happy to be able to simply roam around, look for enemies, get off and find places my vehicle couldn't go. It at first seemed like I had a fair bit of agency to do what I wanted. I found a little nook with a few enemies, eventually I found a body with a piece of clothing marked ""Juno"". How interesting. I then found a one-way shortcut to a radio tower of sorts that I couldn't get to before. ""Oh, this is how to get here..."" but I couldn't do anything. Later I go into an encampment and I'm told that I need to find out what happened to Juno, and also that I need to press a button on the tower or whatever. That's Rage. It's not the best setup.Rage is all about being told where to go, and after this first anecdote, I was never in a hurry to explore past where I was told to since having to revisit the area once under orders just seemed like no fun at all. So instantly, the game goes from initially coming across like a fairly open environment to one where you're shackled to where whatever the npcs want you to do. This isn't bad in itself, since many shooters are linear without much choice in direction, but it certainly makes beelining across the Wasteland on the the buggy following the objective dot to be far less engaging. To make matters worse, many of the game's sidequests, conveniently stashed onto a conspicuous notice board, just require you to revisit mission areas, and maybe traverse them backwards with a swapped enemy set. It's a little uninspired. There are a few sidequests that require you to converse with town npcs, but most come from the boards, which I've never really enjoyed that set up.The game performs well, outside of the infamous texture pop issue of the engine. I thought I was prepared after having played TNO but it's significantly worse here. Luckily the pc gaming wiki was able to provide a near-fix, but those first few minutes of getting out of the Arc were certainly an eyesore. The raw gameplay is solid, I love being about to hold all of the weapon types. The game starts out fairly modest with a pistol, a machine gun, a shotgun, grenades, etc. After 5 hours though you're given multiple weapon types with multiple ammo configurations, and even quick use items ranging from emp grenades to boomerang blade and rc cars. There's lot of options, and I found myself willing to change up my loadout just to get a feel for everything. The quick menu configuration I thought was a little clumsy, with having to access the f1-f4 keys and having all of the various items just be mapped to a single button. Changing weapons and ammo, however, felt very natural. There were also a fair variety of enemy types the made different weapon usage quite the necessity (even on normal mode). Mutants that charge you straight on were better taken out with the shotgun and quickblades, while gearheads and more typical enemy soldiers would be better engaged with scoped weapons or grenades. Throw in the later game enemies with armor and shields and it was never really boring until...the end. The ending is supremely lame. I suppose look it up if you haven't played it.The story is forgettable. You're just fetching stuff half the time. All in all, the game is enjoyable once you get a texture pop fix and get over the rather lame quest structure and mini games and racing, And deliveries and sidequests. So yeah, a lot of fat that could have been trimmed. I think the game could have been a lot more polished if it had a focused goal. I suppose that's a bit tautological but I guess I see this game as being pretty exemplary of having unneeded side systems. I thought the crafting items were interesting enough, even if I mostly made the ammo and lock grinders and grenades and ignored the various boosts and bandages. The gambling games and various money sinks like trading cards, however, just seemed unneeded. Luckily that gave me more dispoable income to just try out various ammo types and build crafting items I normally wouldn't have tried. It also meant I didn't have to put a lot of effort into money-gathering events like deliveries and the monster tv segments. I just wanted to shoot stuff, you know?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												9/10 - no rage quitting here, you'll probably play this in one goRAGE is the reason I like the STEAM free weekends, because otherwise I would have never played and eventually bought this underrated jewel of a game.It's a mix of post-apocalyptic FPS, car wars and CCG (yeah thats right, RAGE includes an in-game collectible card game thats as fun as addictive). And on top you get to craft all kinds of useful stuff.Took me 40 hours to finish but I'm a slow player and had both the Scorcher and Sewers DLCs. An average player will probably spend about 15-20 hours on the base game and 30 tops on the whole package.++PROS+++ World design, characters design, weapons design, everything is original and great looking+ Engaging firefights in extremly varied locations where tactics count and cover is important(!)+ An AI that lives up to its name, from mutants running on the ceiling to soldiers throwing grenades to get you out of cover+ Original weapons like razor-boomerangs (that do return!) or RC bomb cars+ An ingame trading card game where you have to find/buy/kill for cards you use to construct decks which you play against NPCs for cash+ Car races&fights that are just complex enough to be fun but simple enough to enjoy even playing with mouse/kb+ A crafting system that has you hunt for scraps and recipes to craftt everything from ammo to small robots.+ Conversations are mostly voice acted and human(oid) enemies do a lot of trash talk during fights. VO quality is good and even the music is mostly enjoyable.--CONS--- Too less of everything. Places, npcs, quests, weapons, vehicles....had the game triple it's size, it could have become a contender for FO- Not exactly railroaded but far from open world, regions have to be unlocked and the longer the game goes the more often you drive along the same routes over and over again- The story starts out very good but somewhere in the last quarter it looses grip and logic and the ""end"" feels rushed and unfinished- Some boss fights can hardly be won by intuition, you will have to google the tactics once or twice- An autosave system you will have to get used to (it's not unfair though)If you decide to give RAGE a try, get the DLCs from the start - imo they are not much fun to play after the base game's end.

												Get this game,it's one of modern greats up there with DOOM,Quake and Wolfenstein.Having played The New Order (we're talking about id tech 5,2014) it couldn't hold a candle to RAGE's gunplay.Many people will say that RAGE is boring/flawed etc. but they are just spoiled and prefer extensive storylines over gameplay.RAGE's gunplay is hands down the best in a modern shooter and the car combat is very well implented.If you don't like the fetch quests and car combat after a complete playthrough you can play  ALL the combat sections on the Combat Scenario mode minus the travelling.Also,The Scorchers DLC is definitely worth it's money and will only do to add to your experience.All in all this game is criminally underrated and you should play it if you think of yourself as an FPS fan.P.S. After your first playthrough experiment with the console to get the most out of this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Visually the game is good. The characters animations are great. Atmosphere is nice for a post apocalyptic game.It remains a corridor shooter with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending (can't roam for free once you finish the last mission, and that last mission is very very bad). Story is bad.Overall it's a good game if you like to shoot and post-apoc game.Can be compared to :* Borderlands with less guns, less story, less fun, less loot.* Farcry 2 with more sands and less car travel.

												This well designed game, combines a post apocalyptic world, with intense vehicle combat and racing, with mind blowing weaponry. Amazing gear along with amazing weapons with fantastic abilities. I'v played this game many times before and so have many other people, and not once have I ever heard anything particularly bad about RAGE. If you like open-world action/adventure games, in a post apocalyptic world, with many hours of gameplay, this game is with no doubt a great choice for you!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Side effects may include: ○Nausea and vomiting ○Some users may see a change in health insurance coverage or something like this. ○You should discuss this product with you doctor before starting RAGE ○ No user has reported a rash, yet one may actually happen. ○Fatal in cases where you are subject to the Canadian government.

												It would be a competent but forgettable shooter, but as much as I wanted to like RAGE, the id Tech 5 engine is atrocious.  Wolfenstein had many of these problems, but MachineGames did their best to utilize its strengths and cover its weaknesses.  Here, we get to see just how terrible the engine really is.As far as the game itself goes, it's your generic old-school/new-school mash-up game.  The gunplay is still satisfying, as you'd damn well expect from id, but there's just some clunkiness to it I can't put my finger on.  I suspect this also has to do with the engine, as when it isn't microstuttering and streaming 128x128 textures two feet away from me, I start enjoying it again.  I'm not even a graphics snob either, and it still gets to me with just how jarring and distracting the pop-in problems are.The game puts you in a post-apocalyptic world, where bandits are everywhere and you go around doing quests for different people.  You can also get some vehicles along the way, and carry four weapons at a time.  Sound familiar?  Correct, this game hits pretty close to Borderlands in its gameplay.  Sadly, Borderlands takes what it does and does it well, while RAGE focuses more on its slightly-decent gunplay, so it's more of a ""Borderline"" than anything.Let me go out and say, I f@#king hate the car physics.  They're just awful.  You've got turbo and a single handbrake that's way too efficient.  Your car is pretty much glued to the floor, the smallest pebble can stop your car altogether, and moving fast with boost only exaggerates the problems I stated before with pop-in.  I dread any and all cars in this game.On an Nvidia card, the game will be slightly more playable with GPU Transcode as a feature.  However, since they cashed out to Nvidia and decided AMD users (even with their own CUDA, ""Stream"") weren't worthy of a playable game, fellow AMD owners should avoid this steaming pile of sellout♥♥♥♥♥♥like the plague.  Even if you own an Nvidia card, the unoriginal story and only-decent gunplay still isn't worth full price.  id, I'm seriously disappointed.  How such a legendary studio could come up with an end result like this is honestly pathetic.  I'm sorry to say this, but RAGE is my first victim of the almighty Steam Refund.Also, a little texture compression would be nice.  If you're not even going to have these full textures appear in-game half the time, why do they need to take up 30GB I could be using for games with actual effort put into them?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE. What an approriate title. It's all I feel when I play this awful game.This is easily id software's worst game. I played on normal difficulty and it gets super hard for no reason at all. The weapons and shooting are terrible, which is a massive surprise since these guys made DOOM and Quake. The game looks pretty I guess but you can't see anything in dark areas, especially when being shot at by enemies. The enemies in this game take an eternity to go down, but they can kill you with only a few super accurate shots and it's stupid.Just skip this one. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A mixed bag.  What would have been state of the art in 2006 was dated and poorly designed on arrival in 2011 and is postivly archaic in today's market, but there is a charm to the mostly linear experience that is a hallmark of id software games.  The levels are interestingly laid out and look stunning from a distance, but the appalling ""Megatexture"" technology which just wasn't worth the time of day, and lazy placement of objects that feel very clearly placed to cheat you out of exploration do end up frustrating you a lot of the time.The first half of the game feels like it's building up to something interesting, but what feels like a severely truncated second half feels uneven, bland and much weaker than the first half.  Missed opportunities in the story, gameplay and design make this an overall failure, but one that for a few quid, is enjoyable enough to warrant playing through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR MONEY.This games starts very well, but it seems like they must have run over-budget as they were nearing the half-way point, and some pointy-haired, evil corporate-type with a Masters in Business Administration made the developers throw together an ending in a weekend. THERE ISN'T EVEN A FINAL BOSS!!!! Didn't even fire a single BFG round: I was saving them for some huge monster mutant, but the game just ends after you fight a bunch of small ones. Very unsatisfying.This game is also buggy. One problem which is very annoying: the elevator to the secret lair of the resistance will often keep going down, right out of the game map, leaving you stranded in darkness.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well... - I finished this game in Nightmare mode. On a Top computer. Graphics are now a bit outdated.- I dont recommend it if you loved ID software: DOOM, QUAKE, etc... all those legendary FPS games that made the PC computers real tools to play real games. ID software... Just the name is surviving now, not the spirit... What a shame. I'll go back play all those good all games, and will never buy again anything ""made in Bethesda. RIP in peace, ID..- I recommend this game if you are a 60yo fart. If you are a call of duty fanboy. If you are one handed and blind player. This game is a good CASUAL console action game, but dont consider it as a FPS. Its not. You CAN'T even JUMP properly on a bench. HOW can they then promote the ID engine while physics are so miserable. There is no challenge, this is a technical graphic DEMO at its top. Everything is linear, everything is scripted, the IA is ridiculous.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												id Software, the inventors of the FPS genre, find themselves in a rough spot, these days. They leave the gameplay innovation to other developers. Doom 3 was already an 'old-school' retro game, when it came out. RAGE is a classic FPS in many ways. The weapons feel good. The enemies are popping up the same way as always. But the fidelity of the presentations is top notch. The animations are maybe the best you can find in new games & the levels are worth exploring, because id tried something new. They left the familiar ground and gave you loot and stuff to sell in shops. And they added a racing game in between the shooting levels, which is quite fun. You won't find pre-rendered textures. Instead, the lead programmer and mastermind John Carmack worked on his infamous ""Megatextures"", giving artists unprecedented freedoms to craft unique landscapes and levels without the usual restrictions. It's if 2D concept art would have come to life thx to virtual texturing. Worth seeing & playing, IMHO.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: March 5, 2013
												My take: RAGEThere seems to be a lot of mixed feelings on this game. Most people either love it or hate it, and while I think it has some issues, the good outweighs the bad.The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic near future, following the impact of the asteroid 99942 Apophis on Earth. The protagonist, Nicholas Raine, emerges into this setting in the year 2135, with no memory of his identity or objective. There is a lot of potential here but unfortunately it gets pretty generic towards the end, being probably the game's weakest point.In terms of presentation the game is nothing short of amazing. There might be some blurry textures here and there, but they blend so well with the environment that they're hardly noticeable. The draw distance is to the horizon, the characters look and act very realistically, right down to head tracking if you move around during the conversation and the animations are top notch. The audio is pure perfection with a stirring score. There is a lively mix of western and folk music combined with some haunting themes that will send shivers down your spine as you explore a vast underground water facility, a massive dead city, or the sinister lair of mutant cannibals.Gameplay wise this game has a lot of variety: card games, racing, shooting. There are plenty of other things to do within the in-game world than just run down through a list of missions. In addition to the core gameplay, the game also offers numerous side-games within the story to diversify the experience even more. There are a variety of RPG-esque elements, including inventory management and a crafting engine that will help keep you stocked with the supplies and tools that you need to survive. My only gripe in terms of gameplay is the fact that the game is too easy even on the harder difficulties.The multiplayer features a 2 player co-op mode in which you can replay a few memorable levels from the campaign and a racing mode called Road Rage. Classic DM, TDM and CTF are surprisingly absent.Graphics: 9Sound: 10Gameplay: 9Story: 8Multiplayer: 8Overall: 8.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When the basic controls of a game feel tight and responsive, everything you do feels more substantial, and the rest of the game becomes that much more fun.  Nintendo realizes this, Infinity Ward realizes this, and apparently id does too.The stuff you’re doing in RAGE isn’t even that interesting.  While playing the game I realize that I’m just doing basic errand boy crap that would be boring in any other game – but I still want to do it.  The objectives aren’t at all important beyond being new excuses for you to engage in the game’s tightly crafted gunplay. http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9092083 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

graphics, sound and characters when i fist started the game i was like WOW. my rig could hardly run it, i could hear my old nvidia gts250 gpu fan making crazy noices while loading the hardly medium settings. ok the grapgics are very nice, even with those settings i could see a great work done for environments, effects, mappings and textures. awesome designs of characters and vehicles, it was like playing a realism mode of boardelands. the animations are also very nice and the face designs were very well done although they had no expretions. the sound effects were overwhelming, and the direction was so damn great it can make you staring around the enviroment while mouth droolling.game play the game length was very short actually... yes there are quite a variety of things to do in there, but still the quests are few and your options are narrow. plus you dont get to play free roaming around the wasteland after finishing the game.HOWEVER. the physics... god... the physics FAILed so badly. very very badly. VERY narrow gaming, you can't even jump over a 30cm obstacle just because the designers don't want u to go that way even if its way too obvious that you could go there. everything around you is just for looks, no interactions AT ALL. absolutelly non. all items are fixed inside teh environment graphics. Rage is actually a quake game with an upgraded engine. That's exactly what it is.the price for such a game is unacceptably high. i mean comon, after playing scifi games like crysis, mass effect and fear, RAGE looks like an old retextured game. they put too much efford for designs and environmental graphics, but they didnt work on the rest. it is... just weird...! wait for a sales opportunity, the game is worth playing, but not for such a price..

												WARNING! This game may send you to sleep. DO NOT play when operating heavy machinery or baby sitting.All been done before. All of it. Every single part of this game is so generic and has ALL been done before. There is nothing that stands out at all.Imagine Borderlands with a slightly more realistic art style and all the humour removed. Then call it Boringlands. Then imagine every FPS moment you've ever experienced replayed in the most average way possible. That's Rage. Boring quests, boring characters, boring driving sections. Oh and a boring environment. I couldn't stick around long enough to learn more about the (boring) plot.If this was the very first FPS with driving and side quests in a post apocalyptic world then it would have been fun. It simply arrived too late and does everything in such a standard way, never trying to make its own impact on the genre.Rated BG (Boring and Generic)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bad PC performance, boring, repetitive, I even heard someone mention that the sound was bad. If this game had been released today in 2015 all patched up from an indie developer - it would probably receive high praise. This thing is $20 now and you probably spent about as much to go and watch Mad Max: Fury Road... if you did I suggest you pick this game up. The graphics are fantastic (some low res here or there), the sound design is impeccable (ambient, soundtrack, environmental and combat sounds layered nicely at all times), fantastic level design - the game oozes fun. The AI, though certainly not great, is at least very interesting, the weapons are huge, feel great and look great. The buggy sounds great and feels great, the character design is great. Everything is streamlined and simplified, almost like they took an arcade racing game, Borderlands environment inspiration, added some Doom 3 elements and tried to guess what Blizzard would try and do with merging the gameplay & streamlining to make it fun, polished, intense and somewhat goofy. This game doesn't dissapoint; however, the gaming public's past attitude towards this game certainly was.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I kinda whish steam had a star rating system rather than a yes/no. I had to give this game a yes because if it is on sale for a few bucks I'd buy it again. That being said. This game tries way to hard to be borderlands, which it is very clearly not. It has some cool aspects and is entertaining.The worst part is that it is a obviously a very poor console port. It really doesn't even look that good for how crappy it runs with AMD hardware.Overall if its on sale give it a go. I wouldn't spend more than 5 bucks on this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												All the hype and fan-♥♥♥♥♥ing aside, despite some of Rage's flaws, it is a mindblowingly fun and gorgeous gaming experience for those that love certain things about first person shooters - violent, bloody death scenes and an arsenal that kicks serious♥♥♥♥♥ The AI was pretty darn decent (and amusing), the different ammo types were fun, and I absolutely adore sentry bots/turrets so had a fab time trying out the different gear. The racing elements weren't necessarily my idea of fun but the mixed genre was different for me and I quite enjoyed that. Its a beautiful, fun first person shooter. Did I mention poprocket ammo for the shotgun, mind control bolts and dynamite bolts for the crossbow and sentry bots / turrets? Noice. Grab it - if your gear is decent and can handle the game, you won't have much to complain about! :) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 16, 2014
												RAGE is the newest first-person shooter from ID software, the company that created famous FPS franchises like Doom, Wolfenstein and Quake in the past.The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world, where an asteroid destroyed civilization as we know it. Instead, the world is now ruled by mutants, bandits and a group of mercenaries called The Autority. You, as a player, are still human and a survivor from the asteroid crash and will fight these enemies that plague your world together with your friends known as the Resistance.As you probably noticed, the story as I tell it here seems pretty mediocre and unoriginal, and that's because it is. The characters  you meet in the game are in no way remarkable and the missions itself are almost every time fetch quests with the following structure:A) Drive to the location on the mapB) Shoot enemiesC)Fetch the itemD) Drive backThe game has an open-world structure where you can drive vehicles, but you probably won't be doing much exploring, because the world itself is pretty boring and there's really nothing to do except from the main quest and some side quests. It makes you wonder why this is an open-world game in the first place. Maybe the creators had bigger things in mind with the game but could not work them out due to time limits? I don't know. Most of the time, you will spend in a town where you get all your missions and where you can restock on ammo (which is really necessary, because during the missions itself you won't be finding much ammo at all).When you make it past the driving sequences and into the real missions, the game really delivers with great shooting mechanics. You have a lot of options to defeat you enemies: you can use weapons like shotguns, assault rifles, snipers, pistols and rocket launchers, which all can use different kinds of ammo. You can also craft a lot of stuff like grenades and robots that can help you. Although the shooting sequences are fun, the enemy AI isn't always that challenging: I had moments where enemies were all lined up, not moving, while I could kill them one by one with a sniper. Most of the time this wasn't the case though, but overall AI could have been better. During the shooting missions, I liked the boss fights the most, and it's too bad there were only a handful of those.Graphically, RAGE is a bit schizophrenic: sometimes it's really beautiful, especially the characters, but at other times it can look like crap due to some really bad textures. It also suffered from pop-ups, where the textures first look really blurry at first, then to become more detailed.The sound was very good: the voice acting was OK and the weapons sounded really good. Music during the action scenes was well chosen.While the game clearly has some issues, like the story (probably one of the worst and dullest endings I've ever experienced in a video game) and the open-world setting, I would recommend this game to people who like FPS games that can look past these shortcomings I listed, because as a shooter it really is a lot of fun.

												Played and finished this game offline about a year ago and just thought I’d revisit it a bit. It’s a constricted open worlder, it runs well, the graphics are brilliant, sweet enemy AI, shooting/ driving mechanics feel a little constricting (but overall good however), there are some compulsory mini games/ missions and they suck. Final battle was anticlimactic AF!I’d say pick it up if you’re into post-apoc style and nice fps ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When the basic controls of a game feel tight and responsive, everything you do feels more substantial, and the rest of the game becomes that much more fun.  Nintendo realizes this, Infinity Ward realizes this, and apparently id does too.The stuff you’re doing in RAGE isn’t even that interesting.  While playing the game I realize that I’m just doing basic errand boy crap that would be boring in any other game – but I still want to do it.  The objectives aren’t at all important beyond being new excuses for you to engage in the game’s tightly crafted gunplay. http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9092083 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was fun but highly overrated. For ID fans, this will be a romp down memory lane. Not much has changed since Doom and Quake except better graphics, a racing component and new gun modes. Gameplay was a lot like Doom where the only real problem was running out of ammo when too many enemies are thrown at you.  Calling this an RPG shooter, when one has played Fallout and Borderlands is a little laughable. The story is really, really unimaginative.Still, the racing can be fun (albeit not tied well to the main game) and the Magic-esque mini-game was entertaining.I think Metacritic was extremely charitable  to give it a 79/100. I would give it a 65/100 at best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Until I get a new subscription for Fallen Earth, I'll be playing this for a while.8.5/10PROS-Great visuals-Great gameplay-True to the FPS and RPG genreCONS-Stiff vehicle handling and animation-Voice acting is iffy-Almost as buggy as Dead Island and Fallout NV ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage had a lot of hype behind it and rightfully so. id Tech 5 introduced ""Mega textures"" and bolstered some other neat features. So did the engine and the game deliver us the true ""next gen"" id experience? Yes and no.You are an Arc survivor, one of the best [badass] and brightest of humanity before a major calamity befell earth. You wake up from your cryo-sleep ready to rebuilt society. Only to find the world has been reduced to a wasteland filled with bandits, mutants and is under control of the ""authority"". While getting on your feet, helping some of the more civilized natives you come across an overarching plot that ties everything together.The wasteland that you find yourself in is a pseudo open-world. It has a clear structure of progression with separated locations on the two over-world maps to clear out. You'll take on quests from people you meet in the hub towns and you're free to tackle all your quests in any given order. You travel to each location with a selection of quads and cars, all upgradeable at your leisure. While traveling from location to location you'll notice that the big draw here is the variety the id Tech 5 engine provides. Repeated textures are few and far in between, creating some wonderfully diverse scenery of sprawling vistas. This however comes at a cost.Rage uses immensely large singular texture maps [""Mega Textures""] for each location, streaming in only that what's being looked at at that moment. The most noticeable problem is that if you spin around 180 degrees or round a corner you'll see the textures clearly stream in. Another problem this generates is that because each location essentially has one large texture file the resolution of individual objects might seem rather low at close proximity. Because of these issues and the lack of directly being able to resolve them in the video settings menu [without going into the developer console], it is recommended that you use a GPU with 2GB of VRAM. I would also reckon that because of the sheer size of the textures a SSD drive would greatly speed up this streaming process as well.Do these glaring problems still make it worth exploring? Yes. Despite it's shortcomings Rage presents a wonderfully hand crafted world for you to explore. Each location you'll visit has a clear flavor, look and feels completely unique.The level design varies and changes per location, as do it's natives. Enemies come in a variety of flavors and the AI's tactics will be completely different from one faction to another. How each faction navigates their environment differently can make initial encounters jarring and tense. All that being said, everything can be disposed of with a well placed buckshot or two. The gun-play feels like the signature id Software gameplay we all grew up on, while also throwing in some new elements [vehicle combat] that can be hit or miss. All you need to know about the guns is that the signature id Shotgun and BFG are properly represented here.To sum it all up, Rage is an interesting, gorgeous but sometimes frustrating ride that stumbles in it's execution. With John Carmack's departure from id Software it might be the last ""true"" id game we see. And that's exactly what it is, it's an id game. Now suck it up, strap in and blow some bandits away.- Full disclosure - I played and 100% completed the SP component of this game on Hard. I have as of writing this review not touched any of the DLC or MP components.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage has to be one of the most enjoyable fps games that I have played. In its own chaotic way it manages to keep the ever so used post apocalyptic wasteland fresh. There are more colours, lots of cool weapon upgrades, decent vehicle battle system and even RPG elements - skills, crafting and quests. If I think about it in retrospective none of the components where really staggering but it’s the way they come together that makes Rage feel like really solid title. Mowing down hordes of nimble zealous wasteland freaks with mind control crossbows or zapping their heads off with wing sticks is for some reason just a ton of fun. Also the pace of the game is really awesome so you never feel stuck in one town too long and the explorer types get their rewards from all the cool little guns/upgrades you can find from the wasteland too.The characters/dialogue part is also well done in comparison to your average FPS, but it really just serves the purpose of getting you into more trouble rather than telling an amazingly deep and interesting multilayered story.Additionally there is a pretty cool card collecting minigame in Rage and a racing league. A few others as well. Cool.All in all, an 8,5/10 in my book and well worth looking into, if you like shooting people.E: just did some coop action with a friend and my god the was that fun. just like intensest moments of the sp, just concentrated. well worth looking into. Adds another several hours to the game play!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I absolutely LOVE this game. Have played it through 3 times now but I'm amazed there has never been (as far as I know) a Rage 2 follow-up. I'm sure it did well both at full price AND reduced so come on ID, what happened?! :)If you've not played this before, play it now. You won't regret it if you enjoy FPS games with great graphics and game play. If there was a Rage 2, which is unlikely now sadly, I would STILL definitely buy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really enjoyed what I have played so far.  It is true that the driving isn't as fun as the shooting parts but the driving parts arn't bad either.  This game actually does a lot right.  It is varied and gives you lots of different things to do.  The guns feel powerful and meaty, as in any ID FPS, and it gives lots of options to customise the ammo you put in your gun.  It has a crafting system so you can make your own ammo and sentry bots and remote control car bombs and ....etc.  Wing sticks are a good addition and adds a new level of strategy when 4 guys are running towards you twirling through the air with flaming baseball bats.  The enemy AI is really well done.  In fact I think this game has the best AI I have ever played against in an FPS.  Graphics:  Are really well done.  The scenery is really beautiful as well as character models.  Some of the inside textures are low quality but it doesn't really detract from the overall feel.  You just might not be able to read what it says on a vending machine or on a computer screen.  Does not affect gameplay one bit and there are plenty of high res textures in the game.Sound: Very interesting soundtrack with the different guitar noises whenever you complete a quest.  It almost made it that much more satisfying to beat every mission.  The music in the FPS sections really sucks you in how it adds urgancy and scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you at the same time.  Overall I would recommend this game for ID FPS fans.  If at first you are discouraged because of the racing parts, just keep going, it gets much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is absolutely one of my favorite games because of the smooth-as-silk gameplay, beautiful graphics, excellent story, great sounds and ambience- an incredible AAA title for a super low price.I played this game to the bitter end and it left me wanting to play more! I have the expansion but I could have kept playing this game through more missions. The character actors too are fabulous. You'll recognize a famous voice right at the start. I'm not going to spoil anything but there was one scene where I jumped! I don't jump or get frightened easily and certainly not for a PC game but this game GOT ME! Wow. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I keep coming back to rage. Most people ask why? I just love rage. It must be the ID software fan dedication that keeps me glued to rage. The gameplay is ok, the graphics are ok, and the physics are ok. Nothing spectacular about rage, but it keeps me coming back for more each time. I do like the wasteland and the story, but everything else is just sub par. The hype it created before it released was huge, and maybe that is why I keep playing this game.

												This is a great game with a few drawbacks. Gameplay is amazing... (reminds me a lot of Wolfeinstein) but the story is only about 6/10. There is no end boss; in fact the biggest boss in the game is about halfway through. There is some repeditive busy work but again, taking people out in this game is amazing. It took me about 17 hours to go through everything and I believe it has some good replay value. Now that I know the game, I am replaying on NIGHTMARE mode and finding it a lot of fun.This game goes on sale every once in a while so I suggest you wait and pick it up then but I don't think you will regret your purchase.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can only comment on the single player campaign of the game and I did not buy the DLC 'The Scorchers'.- Game is from 2011 but graphics are fine in my eyes. Well, they are good enough that you also will notice that a lot of textures look low res when you come close, for me this was not a big problem, I had a very old display and system a few weeks ago. If you think a game like for example Skyrim looks bad then you may already be used to something different and please keep that in mind if you continue reading.I had very little texture popping after I found a fix for the issue on the net. Once I bumbed into an invisible car.- Music and sound effects are good too, music I often turn off because I like to concentrate on the effects and ambience but this music I listened to, it was quite fitting, situational and well done.- Difficulty: The game was so easy in the beginning that I switched to the highest difficulty early, you can do this without restarting. I have a tendency to slowly explore and hold my position in a single player FPS if that is possible, this and the fact that there is no gun swaying when you zoom in with certain weapons was the death sentence for a lot of the standard enemies in this game. There is recoil of course but you just need to be a little patient and use your cover. Enemies use grenades but you have the time to get away, they will yell 'use a frag' or something similar and then you know you soon need to retreat a bit, also grenades tick and the direction you need to avoid can be seen on screen once the grenade gets close. If enemies decide to leave cover and charge then you usually will hear about it too. Being patient also meant I did not need any healing besides the auto healing most of the time, the auto healing in this game especially means that scouting will not cost you anything in a lot of situations. Then there were agressive standard melee enemies, mixed sometimes with other enemies and this was a bit more challenging. But you may know what is the standard close combat weapon and it's powerful. The last mission again was a little more difficult but of course you also have the most powerful weapon then. For some reason I did not get myself to use self made rules, if you give Rage a try and are an experienced FPS player then maybe hurry sometimes though there often is no need, you could limit the amount of ammo for certain weapons per mission in the beginning at least, something like that. Later the game got a little more difficult but for me the highest setting was ok and I finished the game with a lot of unspent resources in my inventory.There was a side quest that was a challenge and there may be more side quests and/or races that are difficult, I did not play through all of them because side quests from the job boards often lead you back to an area you know already. And I am bad at race games, winning the easier races though was sufficient to be able to buy enough upgrades.- Characters look good and one in particular was done well enough to let me hope for some more story telling at a certain point, though I did not expect a story rich game. The tension after all did rise after that, there were 3 boss encounters, the atmosphere changed to be more threatening and a tougher fight. It's ok when a game has its climaxes and its weaker moments, the alternative can be boring.- Story: Do you know the line 'Skip that if you want.' ? It's the beginning of the 'story' of the first Doom iirc. The developers have come a long way, skipping text is required regularly now (joke). Seriously you should not try to skip the story completely although - to quote a line in the game - 'no one reads' in the world of Rage. Not going to spoil it, I just suggest we don't let it come to this. Though the game is not too short imo the story was almost over when I found the main purpose for a hero in the wasteland, from that perspective the game seems unfinished. Overall the story is very shallow.- Easy difficulty does not mean it is a game with weak level design, after exiting the wasteland everything is quite linear and some places indeed were a little boring but other locations were well done and there are a lot of scripted encounters. Actually 'scripted encounter' is just a category I'm used to, the 'standard AI behaviour' if something like that exists in this game separatly is not bad at all too. Enemies behind cover for example often are not stupid, you just are too powerful for them usually. Compared to what I am used to the AI has improved a little. But I also have to say the last mission is a letdown. It also is quite short..- Some of the buildings look like from a different planet, maybe they hired an architect tired by the restrictions of reality, nice.- No bugs besides the invisible car I think. Well, once two enemies looking at me did not shoot until I got very close which I 'had to do' because I guess sometimes I need to be shot at first to feel better when... yes. Rarely enemies did not correct their position when only partially behind cover and when being shot at.- Violence: I may be getting closer to the point when I simply saw it often enough, be it a simulation only. I already focused in this ID game on the technological progress I could witness for 10,- € because of my very old PC before this one and the developers deserve full credit for it, and I forgot most of the bloodshed already or so it only seems to me because I also know now there are some consequences in our brains if we make violence more than an occasional experience in our life, there is scientific evidence for this afaik and there is a lot of killing in this game of course, the killing of images of human beings most of the time. What I certainly do remember was ""The best idea a 12 year old ever had."", it was the description of a weapon. There was at least one other description which I personally would not want to be responsible for. I may return again to an ID game to watch true progress too but I will give a decision and consequence heavy experience more than one try before getting the new Doom if at all, guess I will wait and buy when and if I get the honest feeling that they get what they deserve, from the demo it seems you shoot evil daemons and possibly with good reason, so all right. For me and increasingly it really does make a difference if there is a good reason for the killing. Now there certainly are reasons for the violence in Rage but the justification feels done halfheartedly 'on the way'. It gets a little better at some point when you get an explanation why the main opposing faction indeed needs to be stopped but behind the shallow story the bad guys certainly are out of their minds simply because we sometimes like to be out of our minds in games. According to the achievements 65% of the players have not even seen the said explanation btw, maybe single player is not important for many and/or the game does not update achievements when you get them in offline mode. Anyway, Rage is bad science fiction at best, certainly a game for 18+.- Though not really a new idea the early setting of the game is ok. Asteroids are a potential 'civilization ender' as someone from NASA did say. You pay with paper money called 'dollars' in the post apocalyptic world, that's another thing I did not forget but this somehow was funny at least.- Some people claim to have finished this game in 12-16 hours, in my case the in game timer (not steam) showed 24 hours at the end. Well, I tried to avoid death but that's quite a difference still. And the (last) hope of the wasteland was destroyed anyway 5 times total in my case, 4 times because of impatience if memory serves.

												People can compare Rage to many other games, however it reminds me most of Borderlands with a touch of Fallout and a pinch of Mad Max. However Rage has something new to offer. Yes, it is similar to other games, however what game is not? Rage has a style all its own and really pulls off what they were going for. This is a very grungy game, yet it has times of bright sunny skies and colorful scenes.The story is not heavily detailed but that's alright for the type of game Rage is. It's a FPS that gets to the point and you never feel bored while playing. I thought the story was enough for me to have an idea of what's going on and get me into the action very smoothly. The first few missions give you a better idea of what's going on and flow of the story feels balanced.The gameplay mechanics are very easy to use and to adapt to. Driving is fluid as is walking. The pace of walking is a bit quick, but I like it that way. Be that as it may, I often slowed down my pace to really take note to the detailed environments of the caves, tunnels and dilapidated buildings I scrounged through. The enemies are a joy to fight and have a mind of their own. From scaling the walls to jumping at the last second to dodge your attack, it quickly reminded me of the splicers who walked the ceilings of rapture in Bioshock. This makes it all the more challenging and enjoyable. Lastly, RAGE incorporates some RPG elements to help sooth that part of my gaming palate in the forms of customization, upgrades and side missions. All of that and a vehicle only multi-player tacked on? I believe that's a pretty good package.All in all, I am happy with this purchase and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys shooters with creative atmospheres. I have read mixed reviews about it's length not being what people had hoped (about 10-12 hours) but then again, many of the shooters I have completed were only about 8 hours. With the existence of towns throughout, this will allow me to pace my gameplay and savor the experience without blowing through it a la any other mindless shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A SOLID AND UNDERRATED FPS! In short, Rage has all the basic pros of what old fps games did fun and ""right."" The world and setting is interesting enough, the guns are plentiful and diverse enough not to become too stale. The car racing/ car combat functions well enough and is fun if you are into that stuff. The RPG mechanics that are in Rage are not deeply implemented, but are a fine side distraction that allows to build a better, flavorful arsenal. Which in turns lets you choose how you want to plan and play. Although, the stealth combat in this game is honestly pretty half asssed, and non too stealthy. BUT! The MAJOR PRO(S) for me in Rage is the animation. From how the enemies move, interact, and just...animate, and down to the facial expressions looks amazing! Especially condsidering how old this game is, for when it came out for its time of modern FPS, and... it just looks and moves pretty damn good. Now, the MAJOR CON(S), with the ending being the biggest con of all, is that the ending just ends. Like a blatant, ""Hi and Bye"" where the build up was already lukewarm, and felt ham fisted at the very last second. Yet, it is not a bad ending. It just is what it is. An end. Who knows, maybe one day, hopefully, they make a sequel to Rage. Anyways, another gripe I have with Rage is the fact that there only two enemy types throughout the game: Guys with guns who shoot, take cover, occasionally throw frags, and repeat. The second type being melee-only enemies who charge at you with caution thrown to the wind. NOW, these last two cons are personal, and may not even affect your play experience in the game, but the shotgun has no ♥♥♥♥ing spread along with missing point blank at times!! Plus, the first assualt rifle you pick up/buy is pretty crap, mate. Even, when you upgrade it, and use armor piercing rounds, for the most part takes half a clip to kill a guy ON NORMAL DIFFICULTY. Especially true halfway through the game. Not to mention it's spread is♥♥♥♥♥♥even when ads. Half the time it is inaccurate so much it becomes annoying to use. OVERALL I GIVE RAGE A 4 OUT OF 5.

												I really wanted to like this game, I preordered it, I tried so hard to like it, I waited for patches and hoped that this game would improve, but it just dull and forgettable.Nice looking graphics though but everything is just so empty, you cannot properly explore, the characters are lifeless and forgettable. The story starts off interesting then bust goes nowhere.The game feels like a tech demo that was stretched into a game.There is little to no variety of gameplay. At one point there is a stealth element then every mission becomes the same dull shoot everything mantra. There is very little challenge to this game.For its asking price, you could buy several other games, fallout New Vegas is a few dollars more than this game and will offer you a far more rewarding experience. This game is pretty much a lame tech demo, soulless story and lifeless gameplayAvoid!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So after finishing the game that I was really looking forward to, I have mixed feelings with RAGE.PROS:+Great action. +Addictive driving and fun car combat. Fun races too! +Great weapons with good sounds+Impressive graphics once setup properly.CONS:-VERY linear -LITTLE exploration. No free roaming à la Borderlands / Fallout 3. -Few side quests / jobs to do.-No deathmach mode for multiplayer (very unlike id Soft)-Online racing can be tedious to find other players.-No BOSS FIGHT in the last chapter (quite unlike id Soft)-No proper closure of the campaign mode (still no DLC)-ATI Drivers issues at game launch made the game unplayable till months later. (Waited 5 months till the game was playable!)Saddening this game took MANY MANY YEARS in development and it ended up like this. Promising game with many letdowns. OVERALL:A disappointing game with fun shooter elements like id Soft are known for and that it could've been so much more. RATING:7.0 / 10UPDATE:If you loved playing RAGE, you may consider playing the single player DLC which is decent but don't expect more story into the game, unfortunately.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly one of my favorite games so far. I do not own many games, nor have I played many single player shooters, but I thoroughly enjoyed the graphics, the broad choice of very interesting weapons (my favorite is the crossbow), and the way the maps were set up; The way the mobs would come at me either freightened me or made me wish I had been better prepared (playing on the hardest mode with the dlc) but was always very enjoyable. All in all, I loved the game because of how extensive the mini-games or maps were,- the story was decent enough to place many interesting game aspects into it-, but was left broken hearted with how the game ended. I feel like there could have been a better way to end things, without just having the whole game come to a close and being forever kept away from completing other sideline quests.If you like games with great visuals and fun gameplay, I would highly recommend this game to you.P.S. I have been playing this game on and off several times for the past 2 years, and the best tip I can give you is to try and get as much cash as possible as QUICKLY as possible. It will seriously save your life and make some of the most intense parts the easiest. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

graphics, sound and characters when i fist started the game i was like WOW. my rig could hardly run it, i could hear my old nvidia gts250 gpu fan making crazy noices while loading the hardly medium settings. ok the grapgics are very nice, even with those settings i could see a great work done for environments, effects, mappings and textures. awesome designs of characters and vehicles, it was like playing a realism mode of boardelands. the animations are also very nice and the face designs were very well done although they had no expretions. the sound effects were overwhelming, and the direction was so damn great it can make you staring around the enviroment while mouth droolling.game play the game length was very short actually... yes there are quite a variety of things to do in there, but still the quests are few and your options are narrow. plus you dont get to play free roaming around the wasteland after finishing the game.HOWEVER. the physics... god... the physics FAILed so badly. very very badly. VERY narrow gaming, you can't even jump over a 30cm obstacle just because the designers don't want u to go that way even if its way too obvious that you could go there. everything around you is just for looks, no interactions AT ALL. absolutelly non. all items are fixed inside teh environment graphics. Rage is actually a quake game with an upgraded engine. That's exactly what it is.the price for such a game is unacceptably high. i mean comon, after playing scifi games like crysis, mass effect and fear, RAGE looks like an old retextured game. they put too much efford for designs and environmental graphics, but they didnt work on the rest. it is... just weird...! wait for a sales opportunity, the game is worth playing, but not for such a price..

												When the basic controls of a game feel tight and responsive, everything you do feels more substantial, and the rest of the game becomes that much more fun.  Nintendo realizes this, Infinity Ward realizes this, and apparently id does too.The stuff you’re doing in RAGE isn’t even that interesting.  While playing the game I realize that I’m just doing basic errand boy crap that would be boring in any other game – but I still want to do it.  The objectives aren’t at all important beyond being new excuses for you to engage in the game’s tightly crafted gunplay. http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9092083 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A little bit Borderlands, a little bit Fallout 3. Well made, pretty looking, and fun to play. Doesn't have the warped sense of humor like Borderlands and not as expansive as Fallout, but takes a lot from each franchise and ultimately makes something quite enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game the day it came out for xbox 360 (My PC was 100% linux at that point)I played it all the way through and while it felt a bit short I loved every minute of it.I've since upgraded my PC's GPU, dual booted windows, bought it on steam (with the DLC) and am playing through it again.I'm finding it just as enjoyable as the first time I played it and I would like to see more games like it in the future.In my opinion, too many games recently have tried to add far too much content and forgotten to add the fun.These games start to feel like a chore to play and you end up never finishing them. Of course there are exceptions but I have far too many games I will probably never finish because they got boring.Sure RAGE doesn't have the best graphics (although that painted sky is beautiful) nor does it have the greatest storyline, however, it's the kind of game that's genuinly fun to play.The mechanics are fun (I especially like the wingsticks and deployable turrets) and who doesn't like blowing up a mutant with an explosive projectile fired from a massive shotgun? The missions are all slightly different and (at least for me) the game never feels stale or lacking in content.Once you've finished the main storyline and the missions from the jobs board there are always the sewers to clear and now the scorchers DLC which, while quite short, I found to be increadibly entertaining.I get bored very easily and so there are very few games I have played all the way through, let alone gone back to for a second play though. Rage however is one I just can't get enough of.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've already played it for a few hours and have yet to experience a worthy game-killer bug.Now that that's out of the way, RAGE is a really great game with great FPS and RPG elements. Seemingly numerous quests can keep you busy in a seemingly infinite, post apocalyptic wasteland. Until I get a new subscription for Fallen Earth, I'll be playing this for a while.8.5/10PROS-Great visuals-Great gameplay-True to the FPS and RPG genreCONS-Stiff vehicle handling and animation-Voice acting is iffy-Almost as buggy as Dead Island and Fallout NV ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bad PC performance, boring, repetitive, I even heard someone mention that the sound was bad. If this game had been released today in 2015 all patched up from an indie developer - it would probably receive high praise. This thing is $20 now and you probably spent about as much to go and watch Mad Max: Fury Road... if you did I suggest you pick this game up. The graphics are fantastic (some low res here or there), the sound design is impeccable (ambient, soundtrack, environmental and combat sounds layered nicely at all times), fantastic level design - the game oozes fun. The AI, though certainly not great, is at least very interesting, the weapons are huge, feel great and look great. The buggy sounds great and feels great, the character design is great. Everything is streamlined and simplified, almost like they took an arcade racing game, Borderlands environment inspiration, added some Doom 3 elements and tried to guess what Blizzard would try and do with merging the gameplay & streamlining to make it fun, polished, intense and somewhat goofy. This game doesn't dissapoint; however, the gaming public's past attitude towards this game certainly was.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To really enjoy RAGE, you have to go into it with the right expectations.  If you're expecting open world exploration in the vein of Fallout or Skyrim, you will definitely be disappointed.  However, if you go in expecting a well-made FPS with solid third person vehicle driving, then you'll enjoy your time here.The game gives the illusion of a vast open world at the outset, but there really isn't one - most of your traversal is just getting from point A to point B to start a linear FPS mission.  But these missions are where the game really shines.  ID is still at the top of their game when it comes to exciting gunplay and threatening enemies.  The guns all have their own feel and weight to them (instead of feeling like pea shooters like a lot of modern FPSes), and the enemies are smart enough to dodge and duck so you have to constantly stay on your toes. It's really just well designed, fast-paced twitch shooting.While the textures definitely look blurry sometimes, the art direction honestly makes up for it.  Every area has fantastic atmosphere and attention to detail.The biggest problem with RAGE is that it feels like half of a game.  It starts with a relatively slow intro, and then suddenly you're apparently the savior of the human race (because of course you are). There are a bunch of enemy types that are introduced and then suddenly dropped, and the plot never really forms a cohesive narrative. Also, as many have said, the ending is abrupt and anticlimactic. It's a shame it sold so poorly, because I would have loved to have seen a sequel that brought things together.  Having said that, if nothing else, RAGE has me pretty excited for Doom 4.  It proves that ID can still do twitch shooting better than almost everyone else in the biz.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So... I start up Steam. It doesn't show RAGE as an installed game. Interesting... I've been playing it for a past few days now, and why does it suddenly think it's not installed? So I click the Install button... Since the files are already there it won't take long until I'm able to start the game again. Now the plot thickens... Save game corrupt. Verrrry interesting... So I google it a little to no avail. I look inside the allegedly corrupt savefiles: most definitely they are corrupt. Although the file size seems legit, the files seem to contain only ASCII 32 characters. So yeah, no useful information there to be found. Fortunately it seems I don't have to start over, not all the savegames are corrupt, but at least 6 hours of playtime is down the toilet. Also I thought it is syncing the savegames with the Steam cloud but it doesn't appear to be doing so. It is syncing something but definitely not the savegames. Savegames are stored ""safely"" on local drive folder ?:\Users\?\Saved Games\id Software\Rage\base\savegame folder. Extremely frustrating experience.But, all that aside I'm finding the game quite fun and playability is also good. I would recommend playing it. It takes many good aspects of other games and combines them. So there's nothing groundbreaking or original, it's all been there and done that. It's been fun and I've found nothing overly irritating. Durig the whole gameplay I didn't experience a single notable bug or glitch or a crash. Ok,that's not entirely true: only once I fell out of the map. Overall I am positively surprised, because all that negative feedback I read prior to playing the game had led me not to expect too much of it. But it seems that the bugs have been fixed and all the other issues addressed. Second part of the game (Eastern Wasteland) feels kind of short or rushed and the game ending is kind of anticlimatic. About downloadable content: Scorchers campain is just fine, but The Sewers - pointless... I played the game on Hard difficulty, it was challenging enough, didn't try any other difficulty levels. But it is a 7/10 game definitely, worth playing. Nice post apocalyptic game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game can't quite decide if its a non-linear open-world game or an on-rails corridor shooter. It's still fun though, especially at the beginning. Racing, shooting, gathering, crafting.... the game even gives you a believable reason for regenerating health.  The setting and gameplay will grab you, maybe not as tightly as some games but still to a degree.It's only at the end that it all starts to fall apart.  While so much of RAGE's setting is fleshed out and detailed a few key things aren't, things like the bad guys.  The obligatory ""Evil Empire"" you're supposed to be fighting is really ill-defined and only vaguely talked about, except in the context of ""well they're evil, duh.""  Since the end game deals extensively with them, the game starts to suffer.The absolute worst point of the game is the end.  The ending literally took me by surprise, as in ""wait, that was the last level?!""  I will not spoil the ending itself, but I guarantee you will be disappointed. Disappointed not for what happens, but for what doesn't happen, specifically ANYTHING.Still, the beginning is pretty fun, and the underlying mechanics of the game are sound.  I would have been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as hell if I'd paid full price for the game, but it was well worth the Steam Sale under $10 price I paid for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is something of a departure for Id in that there is more to Rage than simple FPS mechanics. Sure the shooting is there and what shooting there is is incredibly well done with locational damage and some decent weapons. As well as some amazing enemy animations as well as AI that is impressive in it's ability to take cover. Rage offers more than this though with it's light RPG elements such as crafting and ""quests"" and the buggy driving mechanics which will come in to play while travelling to your quest locations. Here Id's abilty shines with car combat that wouldn't be out of place in a dedicated arcade racer.What really impresses though are the NPC animations, such as the blind Dr with the shoulder robot or the Mayor of Wellsprings who all show movie quality animations and facial tech. Just be wary if you're an ATI owner as there are some driver issues related to this game. 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To really enjoy RAGE, you have to go into it with the right expectations.  If you're expecting open world exploration in the vein of Fallout or Skyrim, you will definitely be disappointed.  However, if you go in expecting a well-made FPS with solid third person vehicle driving, then you'll enjoy your time here.The game gives the illusion of a vast open world at the outset, but there really isn't one - most of your traversal is just getting from point A to point B to start a linear FPS mission.  But these missions are where the game really shines.  ID is still at the top of their game when it comes to exciting gunplay and threatening enemies.  The guns all have their own feel and weight to them (instead of feeling like pea shooters like a lot of modern FPSes), and the enemies are smart enough to dodge and duck so you have to constantly stay on your toes. It's really just well designed, fast-paced twitch shooting.While the textures definitely look blurry sometimes, the art direction honestly makes up for it.  Every area has fantastic atmosphere and attention to detail.The biggest problem with RAGE is that it feels like half of a game.  It starts with a relatively slow intro, and then suddenly you're apparently the savior of the human race (because of course you are). There are a bunch of enemy types that are introduced and then suddenly dropped, and the plot never really forms a cohesive narrative. Also, as many have said, the ending is abrupt and anticlimactic. It's a shame it sold so poorly, because I would have loved to have seen a sequel that brought things together.  Having said that, if nothing else, RAGE has me pretty excited for Doom 4.  It proves that ID can still do twitch shooting better than almost everyone else in the biz.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is something of a departure for Id in that there is more to Rage than simple FPS mechanics. Sure the shooting is there and what shooting there is is incredibly well done with locational damage and some decent weapons. As well as some amazing enemy animations as well as AI that is impressive in it's ability to take cover. Rage offers more than this though with it's light RPG elements such as crafting and ""quests"" and the buggy driving mechanics which will come in to play while travelling to your quest locations. Here Id's abilty shines with car combat that wouldn't be out of place in a dedicated arcade racer.What really impresses though are the NPC animations, such as the blind Dr with the shoulder robot or the Mayor of Wellsprings who all show movie quality animations and facial tech. Just be wary if you're an ATI owner as there are some driver issues related to this game. 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game. Good fun. Unfortunately I felt a bit like I just wanted to play Borderlands during the gameplay. However there are many fun 'mini-games' and car races/events. Enough to satisfy a change of scenery from shooting bandits.The missions felt a bit too 'samey', going into a hideout or area and shooting bandits to bits, you pass an area you can't get into as you go in and you start to realise you're just going to poke out of their in about 10 minutes time. But, the story within the hideouts change which makes it enjoyable nonetheless. The addition of screaching and random moments of being trapped in with muties bouncing around made me jump quite a few times as well which is always a bonus.The ending [no-spoilers, don't worry] was a bit of a let down for me. I thought the story was going to be dragged on a bit more but it seemed to end quite suddenly and was easy to get to in the last area. Was expecting some kind of huge boss (like Borderlands) but only got waves of armored-muties.Recommended weapon:The wingstick. Mandatory in this game. Never known a game where a modified boomerang destroys all.Haha.In all, 7/10, would recommend if you havn't tried Borderlands or have finished both and want more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is a beautifully crafted FPS with modern tweaks, which feels strange coming from the veteran of the genre. I don`t see ID trying to implement modern tweaks into their new games as a bad thing, atleast as long as they don`t over do it. RAGE is beautiful, has a powerful and satisfying array of weapons along with crafting unique items such as sentries and bots. The game is full of minigames, some fun and others just frustrating. The multiplayer could use some work, and the PC version could be tweaked a little more to satisfy long time ID fans. Not ID`s best work but is still pretty damn fun and entertaining.

												People can compare Rage to many other games, however it reminds me most of Borderlands with a touch of Fallout and a pinch of Mad Max. However Rage has something new to offer. Yes, it is similar to other games, however what game is not? Rage has a style all its own and really pulls off what they were going for. This is a very grungy game, yet it has times of bright sunny skies and colorful scenes.The story is not heavily detailed but that's alright for the type of game Rage is. It's a FPS that gets to the point and you never feel bored while playing. I thought the story was enough for me to have an idea of what's going on and get me into the action very smoothly. The first few missions give you a better idea of what's going on and flow of the story feels balanced.The gameplay mechanics are very easy to use and to adapt to. Driving is fluid as is walking. The pace of walking is a bit quick, but I like it that way. Be that as it may, I often slowed down my pace to really take note to the detailed environments of the caves, tunnels and dilapidated buildings I scrounged through. The enemies are a joy to fight and have a mind of their own. From scaling the walls to jumping at the last second to dodge your attack, it quickly reminded me of the splicers who walked the ceilings of rapture in Bioshock. This makes it all the more challenging and enjoyable. Lastly, RAGE incorporates some RPG elements to help sooth that part of my gaming palate in the forms of customization, upgrades and side missions. All of that and a vehicle only multi-player tacked on? I believe that's a pretty good package.All in all, I am happy with this purchase and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys shooters with creative atmospheres. I have read mixed reviews about it's length not being what people had hoped (about 10-12 hours) but then again, many of the shooters I have completed were only about 8 hours. With the existence of towns throughout, this will allow me to pace my gameplay and savor the experience without blowing through it a la any other mindless shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are also some very fun misc items you can craft like remote control bombs and turrets. There is a very well developed driving element and the driving combat is fast and fun. The biggest downside I have found to this game is that it does not have the strongest central story, so don't go in thinking that you will care deeply about the characters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall, this game delivers a constantly fun experience throughout the whole game, which is more than what many FPS games can claim. It feels as if the designers thought about what's fun first and let the rest of the game fall into place around that concept.I consistently enjoyed the core shooting gameplay. It rewards precise aiming in that headshots do lots more damage. However, the enemies can feel like bullet sponges at times. I overcame this by using the strongest ammunition I could find. I ended up playing most of the game using the starting pistol with Fat Mamma and the shotgun with Pop Rockets. A headshot from a fat mamma or a direct hit with a Pop Rocket is an instant kill on normal enemies. So, if you start to feel frustrated by enemies seeming to have too much health, try that out. Even then, the frustration factor is mitigated by a revive mechanic AND a quick save and quick load mechanism.There's also racing. The racing controls on a keyboard kinda suck. The wheels turn before the camera, so you'll often end up turning to sharply. I didn't try playing with a controller because I didnt' know how it would handle switching between schemes, but I bet that would be better. That issue aside, it's actually a really fun addition to the shooting gameplay and a nice way to break it up and make the environment seem bigger and more lived in. In particular, I liked how they would put challenges that would reward bonus money when you were driving to an objective. It made it feel less repetitive even when you were driving back and forth. between the same areas.It's not without issues. They re-use several areas a few times. I didn't find this to be much of a problem because you're honestly just more focused on the shooting and what the enemies are doing, and they change up the enemies when you re-play through those areas. Also, if you play on a low sensitivity like me, the menus are very unpleasant and difficult to use effectively. It's the fact that they use mouse acceleration combined with a low sensitivity setting that just makes it possible the worst menu experience I've ever seen. Thankfully, you don't need to spend too much time in menus, but it would've definitely enhanced the experience.If you want a fun, precise FPS, definitely get this game.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is so uncomfortable to play. Sights/Ironsites  are slow as a snail and upping the mouse sensitivity makes them just about usable except when not in sights/ironsights the sensitivity is extreme and ridiculous. This basically killed the game for me.I also can't stand how tough enemies are. I wasn't expecting the combat to be super realistic but the first kinds of enemies encountered can survive getting shot in the head in close quarters and they're not wearing helmets, masks or anything else that would protect them (they're actually all bald) and they're surviving pistol rounds to the head! Sorry again this kinda killed it for me and I really couldn't take the game seriously. At the very start of the game there is a shop and you may notice there's a monocular on sale. Anyone with a braincell would assume straight away hey a reconassiance tool that'll be my first purchase! But oh no no no. Whilst you can actually use the monocular... It replaces your ability to use your weapon sights (which is you know... kind of a requirement for combat) it's supposed to be a 'weapon mod' yet it doesn't attach to your weapon and you simply bring it out when you press the weapon sights button. It's so thoroughly ridiculous it's baffling. I'm glad I got this in a sale for £2.59 as honestly I regret this purchase and just want my money back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tough call on on if I should recomend this game or not.  On the one hand, I was very enjoyable.  The shooting felt good, the AI was challenging (even if it realied on bullet sponges) and the visuals where great, but on the other, it was not worth a full price game despite clearly being a great quality game.  I think my biggest complaint is the lenght.  It plays like a quest hub game with a splash of exploration and open world, when in fact this is completly on rails.  It just felt ""off"" at the quality that went into this game only to have it so shockingly short.  Expecially when the plot, setting, and myself where just begging for more.  Over all I recomend as I enjoyed the game and was not disapointed for the low price I got the game for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Must admit, I enjoyed this game much more than I thought I would.  I was stunned by the quality of the graphics and character modeling (every NPC is 100% unique).  Think Fallout as a first-person shooter/racing game.  The story line is pretty generic, and there's far less content that I hoped, but what is there is great fun, especially for something that started life as a mere tech demo.  I can't stop playing Tombstones, one of the many gambling side-games available.  I sincerely hope they revisit this world and give us more to explore in the future.  I'll be waiting in line, eager for more insane dune-buggy combat!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Game falls short right in the second wordlmap - this is ID´s post apocalypse shoot gallery with vehicle races, but if you tought ""ELDER´S SCROLLS!"" when you saw BETHESDA in the credits, look more carefully and you´ll see ID´s software is there too. The graphics are amazing and the game is open-world... if you consider a two-square mile canion with uninteractive gorgeous scenarious where you CAN´T GO open-world. You race in normal races and stupid ones where the objective moves constantly - so even if you tuned up your car you end up losing because you have no idea where to go - and battle with them, either against easy enemies or an horde of final ones, inside and outside the lanes. This was supposed to be a post-apocaliptic race battler with RPG elements. What´s the problem with it? ID´s software dumb touch is the problem. Closing the player in a dead end with either a wave of enemies or big bosses, dumbly blocking strategical positions and exits with impassible little fences, like DOOM does. limiting ammo and grinding, removing maps from interiors so you get lost after you finish the level (the old 'where the ♥♥♥♥ next?!?'), and the most imcompetent corpse-looting in the history of games (not like STALKER where you can loot weapons, or Elders Scrolls where you can even loot armor: this♥♥♥♥♥♥get 5 Bucks per corpse and a little random ammo). Yes, it´s just like a Bethesda game... if you diminished scenario, casualized inventory and cutted the open world to a little canyon. I rarely write reviews, but after THIS game all i can feel is... RAGE.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm glad I gave a second chance to this game. It gets better and better. But somehow it is repetitive and could get boring quickly. It seems I misjudged this game.Stunning graphics.I've never seen this kind of artificial intelligence in any other game. It's Perfect. Definitely raises the bar for FPS genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is THE game that made last year's remake of DOOM possible; DOOM 3 was good, but it still divides fans today.Sure, RAGE may come off as more of the tired, but classic post-apocalypse setting cliches, but id made them fresh again, with their know-how, and from borrowing asteroid 99942 Apophis from the headlines of 2004. Wingsticks are one of the game's trademark weapons, a pity they didn't get quite the following I for one expected them to get.Your rogues gallery of enemies consists of a fairly fresh take on the standard wasteland faire, including the Ghosts, who may or not be the unintentional forefathers of the Warboys from Mad Max: Fury Road. You are also up against the Authority, whose flag, weapons and red-and-black power armor evokes Hitler's SS; then there's the Mutant Bash TV gladiatorial show, hosted by the hilarious J.K. Stiles; RAGE's twists on After The End are the emphasis on vehicles, both to cross the wasteland, and to compete in racing and demolition derby mini games.One of the last adjustments RAGE makes to the recipe is its weapon and vehicle customizations, bought here and there from merchants, or from mechanics with special credits earned from racing. Yes, id put in a version of the BFG from DOOM - and no, I'm not gonna tell you WHERE exactly!Like a nice little bow atop RAGE's neat package, you also have bit roles of John Goodman voicing the first character you meet, and sexy voiced Steve Blum as John Marshall, the leader of those fighting the previously mentioned Authority.Let's face it - without the Scorcher's DLC, RAGE is actually pretty damn short; but with the Scorcher's, you can keep your game going long after the credits, AND you have more reason to hope for a sequel or an HD re-release.Fans of id Software's 26-year track record shouldn't pass this one up.""Ashes scatter, Burnin' Jacob's Ladder, I'm afraid I might fade away!""

												Careful before buying: the game doesn't use steam cloud it only saves locally so back up your saves with Gamesavemanager.This is unimpressive compared to masterpieces from id like Doom and Quake 1-3 mainly because those games redefined and changed everything, but it still has it's merits. To id's credit it is a creative game that has solid, smooth combat and great weapons and enemies, one of the smoothest running engines I've ever played, and also great sound effects. It has great graphics (besides the god awful mushed textures up close) and very nice presentation value and is a lot of fun to play. The combat is really very good, top notch. One big thing that makes combat so awesome is that all weapons sound very good. The weapons sound loud and hard hitting, especially when I blow a guy into outerspace with a point blank shotgun blast and it kabooms in my ears through my headphones.id software worked with Bethesda so Bethesda had some say in it and probably nudged them towards making it a wasteland game like Fallout 3 since it was so wildly popular at the time. That's OK, but I miss the evil satanic neo-gothic stuff from Doom and Quake. It also has a horrible last boss and ending. You do many things and craft and quest and so on, then the game just ends. But id knew they ♥♥♥♥ed that up and there's an expansion that lets you play even after the final boss.This game was an experiment for id to showcase their new engine which is incredible, as I said one of the smoothest game engines I've ever seen. It performs flawlessly. Although the graphics are beyond horrible in some areas, like ground and stationary surface textures. Just a blurry mess. Actually you know what, the graphics in this game just suck balls, period. Fantastic art direction, suck balls graphics quality. Oh and if there is one thing that id absolutely cannot do, it is racing. The racing parts in this game just ♥♥♥♥ing suck and are horribly sleep inducing. Also, the mouse pointer in game menu's, all of them, never feels right. It just doesn't move normally, but loose and crappy.Despite the games numerous merits, it doesn't live up to id's standards when you compare it to Doom and Quake 1-3. It was like they said ""we are going to create a good game even if it kills us"" and to their credit, they did that, but therein lies the argument that prevented this from being their next mega-hit. But RAGE holds it's own for what its worth: a wasteland FPS with very solid mechanics, a phenominal game engine besides the suck balls graphics, and not much else to complain about other than id's standardized approach to it's production quality.Lets just hope that John Carmack didn't leave id software because this game and future projects are what their production mentality is starting to curve towards. Let's hope that we actually see them bring back the magic when they put out Doom 4.Edit: DOOM 4 is the BEST GAME EVER7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is a classic first person shooter with a post-apocalyptic scenario.Graphics:     7/10The good news is that the game on the whole looks very good. When you play it for the first time you will have the ""wow-effect"" as soon as your character leaves the survivor capsule. The particle effects are not exeggerated and suitable. When you get the first weapons you will agree that the developers put some work into them. They may not be everbody's taste but the visual quality is unquestionably good. You can say the same thing regarding the environment.The bad news is that if you look a bit closer at the textures you will be very disappointed. Some are very blurred and directly next to them some are razor-sharp ones, what underlines the blurring even more. It looks like someone mixed Crysis 3 textures with Minecraft textures. Nevertheless the game has a good appearance concerning the graphics.Sounds:     6/10The weapon sounds are really powerful (especially the shotgun). Usually the rule is ""the louder the gun the more damage you do"". The cars have a nice engine noise. While most of the enemies say nothing or have nasty sounds you don't want to hear the villagers have pleasant voices. I appreciate that the developers tried to give everything a sound. That made the game lively and authentic. Due to the really bad enemy sounds I give 6/10. The developers could have made it better than that.Gameplay/Handling/Equipment:     9/10It's an ego-shooter, you will get what you expect. You will spend most of the time shooting mutants and bandits. To keep the player entertained the developers wisely added some side missions to break the monotony. Besides that you can gamble, enter an extensive racing competition to win car upgrades and new cars, play cards with a ""trading card game"" or risk some fingers in the knifegame. The handling is nearly perfect. You can quickly change weapons and ammo type, draw your grenade or fix yourself up. Steering a car is really easy. The equipment is very nice. The different ammo types make the game interesting. If you are tired of normal shotgun ammo then craft explosive ones to transform your shotgun into a grenade launcher. Especially the crossbow has a lot of special bolts.Level design:     8/10The level design is pretty narrow with some exceptions. This makes the combat straightforward and the shotgun your best friend in close quarter combat. The exceptions are mostly the parts where you are driving the car. Sadly there are only two or three sniper side missions. The level routes are very interesting and sophisticated. You will have few monotonous areas in the game. The only really monotonous part is the open world which connects the mission locations.I loved the level where I had to go to the destroyed city to get the defibrilator-upgrade. It gave me a real apocalyptic feeling.Enemies/AI:     5/10The AI is relatively poor. Except for some scripted events the enemies are just charging at you or are not using the covers properly. They don't have teamwork or act structured. Well at least some enemies use special abilities like the ""octopus-like"" enemy with the hook. The enemy variety is relatively low but it doesn't really matter.Story:     3/10The beginning and the basic idea was actually cool but it seems that the developers lost their creativity in the end. You are a survivor of a meteor impact and then... well and then you have to deal with the new world. There are some people who want to use the rescue-capsule for something and you want to free the civillians from the enemy influence and make sure that the capsules don't fall into enemies' hands. I don't really get it, what's so damn important about the capsules? They missed the ""legendary"" reason to fight a big bad company. Im sad that they wasted potential here. Even I could have made a better script for a story. And the biggest disappointment awaits at the very end. No big fight (not bigger than before), noone really cares and nothing you could call an ENDBOSS. The game was made to have an endboss. I was 100% sure of it: There has to be one. But poof. Nothing at all. Borderlands 1 had a crappy Endboss but at least they developed one.Critic summary:     6,3/10Personal fun rating:     8/10     [very good game]With all it's problems and missed opportunities the game is still worth a try.If the developers make a sequel I desperately hope for them to implement an endboss.The game may not have an exciting ending (extremely boring to be honest) but the gameplay and the atmosphere at the beginning and midgame is really enjoyable.I recommend it to buy it for 10 bucks or less.

												It's a strong single-player game and the DLC was good.  Story and action had a good blend and I never felt starving for ammo or firepower like other shooters that are strategy-heavy.  Sure, you had to mind your ammo count but I was never lacking.  Graphics and scenery were cool and it reminded me a little of Borderlands and maybe a bit of Stalker in a different situation.  I would play more DLC if they made it.  Pick it up cheap and enjoy the single-player I say!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its basically Borderlands but with prettier graphics. The plot's a bit loose around the edges and the grand finale is both abrupt and unchallenging. It is very visual, but you're going to need a monster of a graphics card to see it in all its glory. All in all its an okay game, there are some nice touches with sub-games, racing, and tech you can build. But ultimately it feels like half a game. Its pretty short and you kinda get the feeling that there should be more. My score is a 7 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I HONESTLY BELIEVE THIS GAME SHOULD ONLY BE BOUGHT ON SALE!!!Alright, now that I've gotten that out of the way. .  If you're a fan of Fallout 3 and post apocalyptic settings, first person shooters with a variety of guns, like driving vehicles around and even racing them in a side game, then you'll enjoy this game. It's a linear fps with an okay story, some very repetitive quests, lots of driving around like in Borderlands, and it's not all that intricate. You don't assemble any weapons, but you can buy an upgrade every here or there. The voice acting isn't the worst in the world. You don't get to set what your character looks like at atll. The game starts you right in the middle of nowhere, but you're immediately given a mission and a gun. From there on out, you do his missions to gain a couple more weapons and your own race buggy, though you don't really have to race all the time. I hated the racing aspect of this game, but since I went into it with gloomy expectations, I wasn't let down much at all. It was pretty simple, laid back and had a lot of tacked on side games and side quests. I hear the multiplayer is d-e-a-d dead! So it'd be for the single player experience if you're thinking of getting it right now. Which I've heard lasts around 8-10 hours to beat, depending on how much exploring or time you sink inot the side games. All in all, for what I paid, I got a good amount of play time just waiting for me to log back in, but I wouldn't have purchased it if it hadn't been on sale. I'd say if you like SP FPS and a good sale, get it. If you like shooters that have a multiplayer slaughterfest of 1 on 1 or team vs. team, then this is definitely not the game fore you. But I think if you can get it and the DLC for 7 or so bucks, you should.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love RAGE when the rest of the internet says I shouldn't. The internet also wanted some sort of Fallout-like game just because Bethesda published it. What's actually here is a great, visceral FPS with that special brand of id Software flavoring. Do your best to ignore the extraneous racing and hubs and instead hoof it as fast as you can to the next great sequence of unmatched shooting gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being a big fan of any post-apocalyptic media of any kind, I had to buy this when it was 75% off... and I have been very pleasantly surprised. The graphics are different to any other game I've played: they are slightly odd - I don't know the technical reasons why, but the textures from afar look ultra-real, and even the far-distant cliffs and the background horizons are modelled (rather than being 'flat' images). However, sometimes nearby objects can look comparitevly pixelated. Overall though, the graphics are spell-binding. When I first emerged from the Ark, I had to loiter, agape, for some minutes. id have tried to make a 'free roaming' game, and come close to lulling us into beliving that it is one. Certain things make it essentially linear though - the 'internal' levels are 'one route only' and so feel like a simple shooter (I hasten to add that the gameplay is far superior to the tedious shoot-strafe-shoot Doom 3). Also, there is some choice as to the order of missions attempted, but really, it has nothing like the content of other Bethesda titles like Oblivion, Skyrim or Fallout 3. As the Gamespot reviews of Rage correctly say, the characters are animated well and brilliantly imagined, the driving is fun and destructive, and the mini-games are simple but enjoyable. And ok, when you compare Rage to Fallout 3, its an unfair contest. Rage doesn't have even close to the same amount of content (it even has you going back to locations to complete only slightly different missions, evidently to reuse their painstakingly-constructed maps). Having said that, Rage is a step up from Fallout 3 graphically. Overall, if you accept that Rage is a different sort of a game, you won't fail to enjoy it. Rage is all about simple destructive fun, and it looks good while it does it. Highly recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After three attempts at getting through this game (twice on Steam) and 15 hours of my life, I can safely say that this is the most boring post-apocalyptic ""sandbox"" game I've ever played.First of all, there is nothing aligning ""Rage"" with sandbox. The world you're thrown in is absolutely not open and there is fairly little you can do outside of missions. ""The Saboteur"" is a sandbox game. ""Just Cause 2"" is a (great!) sandbox game. ""Rage"", on the other hand, is a dreadful experience of clunky game mechanics, blurry textures with loading delays, cumbersome inventory screens, and most importantly, BORING fetch/kill missions with a little driving mixed in and mini-games that make me want to jump off a building.I can't tell you how many times I've gotten lost within cities or big quest areas (like the Blue Line) without a minimap; it is exclusive for when you're driving around the Wasteland. I also cannot possibly count the amount of times I've tried finding something, coming to a door only to see I can't open it - even inner-city areas are completely devoid of rooms and exploration, unless they're tied to a quest character or a merchant.The graphics of this game - well, we all know how bad they are, and for me no amount of patches and workarounds made a huge difference, except perhaps that the textures are loading a bit faster; but that's still not enough.I have yet to be interested in the soundtrack enough to listen to it outside of the game - the opening cinematic was good but the rest sounded entirely uninteresting.Unless you get this game dirty cheap on a sale, like I did, I suggest you avoid this disaster.

												If you're thinking Fallout, DON'T. This is NOT an Action-RPG! RAGE is a Story-Driven FPS.It wasn't until I understood that^ that I was able to really love RAGE. EVerything about this game is fresh. The combat isn't linear, the AI don't (usually) just sit there and let you shoot them. They push forward, they retreat, and it's always fun to hear the dumb baddies screaming in terror, ""HE TOOK OUT THE WHOLE SQUAD!!! FALL BACK! FALL BACK!!!"" You have a wide variety of weapons and tools to make it quite clear that you are one sick BAMF.I think one of the coolest things that Id has achieved here is that the racing/driving around doesn't feel like an afterthought. It's freaking sweet. I'm not racing expert, but I never got bored of it. If the Authority wasn't so hell-bent on icing me, I would have just raced them for the fate of the world.Finally the multiplayer. It's dead, no denying that. I don't know how popular it was when the game first came out, but it's dead now. You can find people to help you get the Multiplayer achievements in the Steam Community, but that's about the only people who play it. The racing multiplayer is kind of a let down, I never came across a single actual race, it was all objective stuff. The 2-player co-op was quite fun, but really I just did it for the chieves.All in all, 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What is rage, you may ask?  Let me answer that question of yours.The game is set in a post-apocalyptic future, where the civilization as we know it, has been destroyed by the asteroid 99942 Apophis in 2029. Survivors have created settlements and other habitable locations and have been divided into various clans and organizations of their own. Bandits and mutants constantly roam the world and try to salvage and destroy the settlements.The story is your basic, “save the world story”. I could not get into the story of this game, it did not draw me in with anything special. I found no connections to the players actions except saving the world, but you are not greeted with an explanation to why the protagonist do the things he does. The protagonist is a mystery, who just happens to emerge and wants to save the world. I guess that you do not need more information to why you save the world, but it is a detail I would like to see, as to why the protagonist to the choices he does.The protagonist, is an “Ark Survivor”. You emerge to the surface as the sole survivor from your Ark in 2135, and you are immediately thrown into the harsh world that is left. You are greeted by some bandits trying to salvage the wreckage of your ark, you are in an bad position as you lack weapons and equipment, but fear not because you are saved by a wasteland settler, who will teach you how the new world works. From here on it follows a linear story, where you do quest after quest which takes you further up in the world, and soon people will start to hear rumors of the “Ark Survivor”, and form here on the journey only gets harder as you try to save the world from its misery.It is not that I disliked the story itself, I just could not find myself caught in it. I just followed the quest, did what I was told, and not long into the game I started to forget the story itself. But fear not, the story may have been weak for me but there were many other things that weighted in for it.The gameplay itself is what lured me into this game, this is what kept me coming back to the game. It is very action based, with a lot of gun-play, and a few stealth mechanisms if you manage to pull them off.This action is where all the fun resides. You can find yourself stuck waist-down in a firefight, with grenades flying from both sides, until you emerge victorious or die trying. But you do not actually die, since the Ark suit that you wear through the game has a built in defibrillator, so when you are about to die you enter a second chance mode, where you can revive yourself with a percentage of health and take out the enemies around you.I found that the AI was very good, and they have some of the more interesting mechanics, comparing with other games. Bandits dodge your shoots by doing acrobats, tactically advance and fall back depending on their amount, their health and how much health I seem to have. Mutants however swarm the area around you and charge head in, towards you, and jumps around to confuse you.There are not so many different enemies. There are three main categories, Bandits, Mutants and Authority. Each of the three has a number of different subcategories, where you find a handful of changes like, different weapons and different armor, changes in movement and size. Sure there are only three main enemies, but with the subcategories and all the changes in between the enemies, you get a very dynamic feel towards what you are fighting. There are some bosses in the game, which are a nice asset. One is the huge of a ten story apartment and takes some time taking down until you learn the tricks, and another might just be a bandit in some bulky armor shooting rockets at you. I found the bosses to be a nice change from the regular creeps that are sent at you, and they offered a nice amount of challenge, to keep it hard and interesting.The enemies had some changes with weapons, but what do you get?  You get an arsenal of ten weapons if I am correct. At first I thought that this was not enough, that it became to repetitive running about with the weapons you had, but all of that changes soon enough, when I was introduced to different kinds of ammo and equipment. Some weapons got explosive ammo, some got electric, some even got mind-control ammo. There was so many joyful ways to take down your enemies that I had a hard time choosing which was my favorite. The game rewarded you with different types of equipment, your primary were regular grenades, but you also had EMP-grenades, wingsticks (A triple-bladed boomerang), RC cars and some other things that I did not pay so much attention to.There was a nice amount of side quests that you could do, from eliminate, protect, save, gather, races and delivery missions. They offered a nice variation to the linear and dull story, but there was one thing that blew away all of the side missions and that was BashTV, and arena where you could fight through some of the weirdest, immerse, amusing and engaging rooms filled with mutants of all sorts. I spent a lot of time in this arena, rampaging about with my weapons as I had to dodge enemies, spinning blades from the roof, spikes from the floor, you name it.A game cannot be perfect, while there was a lot of things that stimulated, but there were also some things were dull and for me destroyed the feeling of immersion. The first thing I have already mentioned, and that is the story. Then we have the world. From time to time the world appealed me, with how everything seemed to have adopted to the apocalyptic world, how the some areas felt unique. I found it to be way to empty from time to time, and I saw repeating patterns in how the enemy areas were made. There were no weather changes, which withdrew some of my immersion. I also felt like the textures on the environment were to low res from time to time, and badly made, compared to the weapons, characters and vehicles. I had some trouble with the rendering from time to time as well, seemed like the textures were not loading as they should. Other than the problem I had with the look of the textures and their rendering from time to time, the game looked good. It fitted the scene of an apocalyptic world as it was supposed to, sure there was the feeling of it being to empty at certain points, but what else is there to be expected from a game like this.The controls were completely fine, everything did as I wanted it to, when I wanted it. The only thing I disliked about controls was that the camera was locked when you were in a vehicle, I would have liked it to be move able so you could watch around more. but I managed to look past it and enjoy the game for what it was.The voices were well made, sometimes you got the feeling that some of the voices did not fit in at all, but it was quickly overlooked. The game had a nice soundtrack that kept the immersion in place, and made you feel like you were in the heat of the moment. Then we have the weapon sounds, I loved the sound of the weapons in this for some reason. To me they were very realistic, and the sound of someone blowing up or being electrocuted was amusing in so many ways, that it was close to disturbing.Conclusion:The game Rage, is a very fun game to play, if you are able to overlook the issues that I found. I enjoyed it once I overlooked the issues, and I played through the story in about 8-9 hours. For me this time was well spent, by blowing stuff to pieces, blasting them in the face with a shotgun or trying the stealthy approach with a crossbow. If you are a person that likes the action based games where it is a lot of shooting involved, and do not mind if the story is the weak part, f			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I feel this is a title that gets less attention than it deserves, so I figured Id farm up a steam task and do a lesser known game some due justice in the process...RAGE is a game developed by one of my favorite developers of all time: ID Software. Because of this, I have massive fanboy goggles on, and am aware of this fact, and now you are too. Keep this in mind, and so will I whilst writing this.My first impression when playing this game was extremely positive. The opening cinematic, while being incredibly simplistic, does wonders for this game's atmosphere and is just downright beautiful. You are placed into the game without being assaulted with exposition, and I like that, so long as I can get it at my own pace during play. Discovery is one my favorite aspects to any game. The Visuals in this game are fantastic, ID has always been ahead of the curve in the graphical department, and this game really had me drolling with its visi-porn. This game gave me a gamer erection right away, and it persisted for much longer than 4 hours. The meat of the gameplay consists of roaming what remains of civilization while both on foot and in a vehicle with the goal of surviving, learning about your own history, helping remaining survivors that want to help you, and obliterating everything that wants to eat you. Driving, shooting, and shooting while driving are what you do in this game: and those things are FUN. The gunplay is quite good because the weapons are fun, visceral, and ammo is customizable. Each meaningfully unique weapon has meaningfully unique ammo types, making it one of my favorite things about the entire game. Enemy AI being strong also helps make combat satisfying. Driving is fun because cars are customizable, badass looking, responsive, and responsible for lots of great vehicular manslaughter moments. I thought I would dislike the driving, as its main purpose is for what you'd thinks its for: going places. Thankfully, going places is actually fun, and it never takes a painful amount of time, even when you have kill people who get in your way when all you want to do is get to the mission location.Exploration in this game is done in a way unlike any Ive seen. The game is a linear game but manages to not feel like it, and rewards mucking around and looking behind buildings and rocks that you would never need go near in the first place. Random junk like wires and cans all have resale value, and some can even be used to make random gadgets and gizmos on the fly, most of which are there just so you can mess around with more ways to murderize your enemies. The 'Engineering' in this game doesnt feel like a way waste your time or gate your progress, it feels like something a wastes wanderer would actually do given his circumstances and is way more fun than something so mundane should even be. Making RC cars with bombs stuck on them to blow up enemies who arent aware of you is fun, and is just one of 1000 ways to kill your enemies. Enemy and location design is also very good. Some missions are much scarier than I thought they would be just because of the locale and enemies within. While everything has that ""crumbly, abused, neglected, dirty, or repurposed"" design that most post-apocolyptic games have, it still remains memorable to me even though its been awhile since ive played. Variation in the urban and natural areas keeps it not feeling all samey, at least most of the time. The story remains vague initially, which like I said before, is something I actually like. As you begin to discover and learn more and more, the game becomes truly engrossing, and had me invested fully, since it all felt as though I had discovered it, rather than it being rammed up my bum because I needed it to understand whats going on. Unfortunatley right during the biggest highs this game's story creates, the game ends unforgivably abrubtly. The sudden and supremely limp ending to the narrative and game as a whole is THE WORST IVE SEEN IN ANY GAME EVER. YES, EVEN WORSE THAN MASS EFFECT 3. Overall: The game succeeds at being a wasteland explorating, baddie smoking, vehicle smashing, scavenging and wrecking fun fest. I had a really great time with this one, and I recommend it to anybody who has liked any game where you pick up a gun and rearrange a guy's face with it. This game is very underrated and underplayed.GOOD:-GUN DESIGN-AMMO TYPES-VEHICULAR COMBAT/RACING-VISUAL QUALITY-ENGINEERING/SCAVENGING-ENEMY AI-F%$#ING STUFF UPACCEPTABLE:-ENEMY DESIGN-LEVEL DESIGN-NPCS-LORE-LEVEL NAVIGATIONBAD:-THE ENDING IS ATROCIOUS-A FEW SERIOUS BUGS			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I HONESTLY BELIEVE THIS GAME SHOULD ONLY BE BOUGHT ON SALE!!!Alright, now that I've gotten that out of the way. .  If you're a fan of Fallout 3 and post apocalyptic settings, first person shooters with a variety of guns, like driving vehicles around and even racing them in a side game, then you'll enjoy this game. It's a linear fps with an okay story, some very repetitive quests, lots of driving around like in Borderlands, and it's not all that intricate. You don't assemble any weapons, but you can buy an upgrade every here or there. The voice acting isn't the worst in the world. You don't get to set what your character looks like at atll. The game starts you right in the middle of nowhere, but you're immediately given a mission and a gun. From there on out, you do his missions to gain a couple more weapons and your own race buggy, though you don't really have to race all the time. I hated the racing aspect of this game, but since I went into it with gloomy expectations, I wasn't let down much at all. It was pretty simple, laid back and had a lot of tacked on side games and side quests. I hear the multiplayer is d-e-a-d dead! So it'd be for the single player experience if you're thinking of getting it right now. Which I've heard lasts around 8-10 hours to beat, depending on how much exploring or time you sink inot the side games. All in all, for what I paid, I got a good amount of play time just waiting for me to log back in, but I wouldn't have purchased it if it hadn't been on sale. I'd say if you like SP FPS and a good sale, get it. If you like shooters that have a multiplayer slaughterfest of 1 on 1 or team vs. team, then this is definitely not the game fore you. But I think if you can get it and the DLC for 7 or so bucks, you should.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I thought that it was overall not a bad game, but it lacked depth. This game competes with Fallout 3 in terms of setting and mood. The graphics are nice. The shading and lighting is a lot better than Fallout. It feels a bit low poly and some of the textures are washed out despite the otherwise impressive engine.It is very smooth, even at highest settings.The gameplay is nice, but not ground breaking. I severely disliked the feeling that you are on rails the entire time. You can not even jump over small obstacles. There is always only one way to get to where you need to be. Everything is very scripted. Enemies will appear out of nowhere because of the way things are scriped. Your path will frequently close behind you, blocking your way back. As a result there is no finesse to the combat. You can not sneak up on the enemy and take them out silently (forget about the boomerangs, they are worthless). This is something that games like dishonored did a lot better.The engine would have provided the technology for an open world game like Fallout but they did not use it. It is a bit of a shame.There is no way to advance your character and learn new things (it is just a shooter, alright). You can buy a few items to boost but that is about it. There is the whole driving and racing element to the game. While it is fun, it feels like a separate game all together and very disconnected from the shooter part. The story is very linear and is lacking depth. It is also quite short. Where do those mutants come from? Why did they mutate like that within 100 years? We never get to meet people behind the authority. Why are they doing all of this anyway? We meet a lot of characters but we never get to really know them.Finally something for the game designers (and not just in this game but many post apocalyptic games): Why does no one clean up?! People occupy some ruins and install all sorts of traps and machinery but no one bothers to clean up and make the place livable? And why is there is still power in all those abandoned ruins? It makes so sense!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love RAGE when the rest of the internet says I shouldn't. The internet also wanted some sort of Fallout-like game just because Bethesda published it. What's actually here is a great, visceral FPS with that special brand of id Software flavoring. Do your best to ignore the extraneous racing and hubs and instead hoof it as fast as you can to the next great sequence of unmatched shooting gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would reccomend rage on a sale or free. (That is how I got it).  It was very visually appealing, lots of rich terrain and infastructure. I felt like as soon and I got a feel for the game it was over. There are two main areas with what seemed like a dozen or so quests per area and then it is over. (I logged about 30 hrs, but really 20 of that was pushing the quests).The weapons were pretty fun (like watching enemies dance when you hit them with a dynamite dart in the hand) but again I wanted more interaction with the Authority. I wanted more technology from them coming at me and more difficult bosses.  The weapon ranges were pretty cool and I wish there were some challenges in the game that demanded creativity in the choice of weaponry and bots.  You could basically go through the game and use only the shotgun pop rockets and the fat mamma's and be fine.(another fun one is the flame thrower guys.. just shoot them with anything you have and they will sort-of turn away... when they turn away exposing their fuel tank shoot the valve and BOOM)From 0 to 100 I would rate it in the low 70's.  I won't likely play it again.  Pretty fun though.Seems like a book, or series of books about this subject would be better. I really wanted more detail about the post-apocolypse and how the authority came to power and what sort of technology they had. Didn't get much of that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tough call on on if I should recomend this game or not.  On the one hand, I was very enjoyable.  The shooting felt good, the AI was challenging (even if it realied on bullet sponges) and the visuals where great, but on the other, it was not worth a full price game despite clearly being a great quality game.  I think my biggest complaint is the lenght.  It plays like a quest hub game with a splash of exploration and open world, when in fact this is completly on rails.  It just felt ""off"" at the quality that went into this game only to have it so shockingly short.  Expecially when the plot, setting, and myself where just begging for more.  Over all I recomend as I enjoyed the game and was not disapointed for the low price I got the game for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is DOOM creator´s Jhon Carmac last piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥Bethesda should know better than join up with ID software. The Game falls short right in the second wordlmap - this is ID´s post apocalypse shoot gallery with vehicle races, but if you tought ""ELDER´S SCROLLS!"" when you saw BETHESDA in the credits, look more carefully and you´ll see ID´s software is there too. The graphics are amazing and the game is open-world... if you consider a two-square mile canion with uninteractive gorgeous scenarious where you CAN´T GO open-world. You race in normal races and stupid ones where the objective moves constantly - so even if you tuned up your car you end up losing because you have no idea where to go - and battle with them, either against easy enemies or an horde of final ones, inside and outside the lanes. This was supposed to be a post-apocaliptic race battler with RPG elements. What´s the problem with it? ID´s software dumb touch is the problem. Closing the player in a dead end with either a wave of enemies or big bosses, dumbly blocking strategical positions and exits with impassible little fences, like DOOM does. limiting ammo and grinding, removing maps from interiors so you get lost after you finish the level (the old 'where the ♥♥♥♥ next?!?'), and the most imcompetent corpse-looting in the history of games (not like STALKER where you can loot weapons, or Elders Scrolls where you can even loot armor: this♥♥♥♥♥♥get 5 Bucks per corpse and a little random ammo). Yes, it´s just like a Bethesda game... if you diminished scenario, casualized inventory and cutted the open world to a little canyon. I rarely write reviews, but after THIS game all i can feel is... RAGE.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Careful before buying: the game doesn't use steam cloud it only saves locally so back up your saves with Gamesavemanager.This is unimpressive compared to masterpieces from id like Doom and Quake 1-3 mainly because those games redefined and changed everything, but it still has it's merits. To id's credit it is a creative game that has solid, smooth combat and great weapons and enemies, one of the smoothest running engines I've ever played, and also great sound effects. It has great graphics (besides the god awful mushed textures up close) and very nice presentation value and is a lot of fun to play. The combat is really very good, top notch. One big thing that makes combat so awesome is that all weapons sound very good. The weapons sound loud and hard hitting, especially when I blow a guy into outerspace with a point blank shotgun blast and it kabooms in my ears through my headphones.id software worked with Bethesda so Bethesda had some say in it and probably nudged them towards making it a wasteland game like Fallout 3 since it was so wildly popular at the time. That's OK, but I miss the evil satanic neo-gothic stuff from Doom and Quake. It also has a horrible last boss and ending. You do many things and craft and quest and so on, then the game just ends. But id knew they ♥♥♥♥ed that up and there's an expansion that lets you play even after the final boss.This game was an experiment for id to showcase their new engine which is incredible, as I said one of the smoothest game engines I've ever seen. It performs flawlessly. Although the graphics are beyond horrible in some areas, like ground and stationary surface textures. Just a blurry mess. Actually you know what, the graphics in this game just suck balls, period. Fantastic art direction, suck balls graphics quality. Oh and if there is one thing that id absolutely cannot do, it is racing. The racing parts in this game just ♥♥♥♥ing suck and are horribly sleep inducing. Also, the mouse pointer in game menu's, all of them, never feels right. It just doesn't move normally, but loose and crappy.Despite the games numerous merits, it doesn't live up to id's standards when you compare it to Doom and Quake 1-3. It was like they said ""we are going to create a good game even if it kills us"" and to their credit, they did that, but therein lies the argument that prevented this from being their next mega-hit. But RAGE holds it's own for what its worth: a wasteland FPS with very solid mechanics, a phenominal game engine besides the suck balls graphics, and not much else to complain about other than id's standardized approach to it's production quality.Lets just hope that John Carmack didn't leave id software because this game and future projects are what their production mentality is starting to curve towards. Let's hope that we actually see them bring back the magic when they put out Doom 4.Edit: DOOM 4 is the BEST GAME EVER7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the better FPS shooters I've played in quite some time !!  The visuals are varied througout the game. A very lengthy single player  campaign at around 18 hours which offers many variables with side missions for extra $$ and upgrades. The characters (enemy) aslo vary from mission to mission whom hold the storyline well. As with many of the FPS genre they all seem the same --this one has variety to keep you interested and value in the length of the single player campaign.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you can get this game on a budget, then its a great buy....granted most purchases are... ha ha ha. This is a good game.  Its not quite as action heavy or remarkable as say ....""Doom"" made by ID, but it still has good things about it.    If you've ever played Fallout 3 you may have been impressed with the vastness of that game regarding the places to travel, guns to use, things to shoot, and people to meet.   Rage takes a diffrent approach by offering ""quality"" over ""quantity""  Not saying that Fallout didnt have quality, but Rage gives a smaller, more polished and prettier experince.   You dont have as many places to go, but damn it looks georgous and you even get some sweet rides to take you there (the optional races in those rides are fun too).  You may not level up your character, but you get some wicked high-tech gadgets to become force multiplyers.   There may not be as many guns, but the guns you do get all have a role that never gets tossed aside and you obtain deadly new varities of ammunition  that changes how they operate and the level of carnage they can cause. The graphics are amazing.  The character details are amazing.  The animations and behavior of the things trying to kill you are amazing.  No joke, its great to have one of the Ghosts do a parkor flip off the side of a wall to avoid your shotgun blast.  I was even suprised to notice that a NPC computer controlled ally of mine maintained realistic gun control and even kept their trigger finger outside of the trigger guard until he was ready to shoot.  Its this great level of detail that makes Rage a new experince that I would encourage others to try.  Whats not so amazing?  The way it ends.   It seems like such a great build up for something that doesnt ever seem finished.  Perhaps they put too much detail in other things and they just ran out of time and/or money, but it seems like it ends to abruptly for a proper ending.  Not really timewise, but gameplay wise.Also after completing the main story and the DLC you're going to be quite constrained.  In fallout and borderlands you can at least go around the land and shoot things.... in RAGE ( please correct me if I'm wrong) you cant unless they changed something in an update that I dont know about.  Once you beat an area enough times that area is closed off.  Kinda lame.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is a classic first person shooter with a post-apocalyptic scenario.Graphics:     7/10The good news is that the game on the whole looks very good. When you play it for the first time you will have the ""wow-effect"" as soon as your character leaves the survivor capsule. The particle effects are not exeggerated and suitable. When you get the first weapons you will agree that the developers put some work into them. They may not be everbody's taste but the visual quality is unquestionably good. You can say the same thing regarding the environment.The bad news is that if you look a bit closer at the textures you will be very disappointed. Some are very blurred and directly next to them some are razor-sharp ones, what underlines the blurring even more. It looks like someone mixed Crysis 3 textures with Minecraft textures. Nevertheless the game has a good appearance concerning the graphics.Sounds:     6/10The weapon sounds are really powerful (especially the shotgun). Usually the rule is ""the louder the gun the more damage you do"". The cars have a nice engine noise. While most of the enemies say nothing or have nasty sounds you don't want to hear the villagers have pleasant voices. I appreciate that the developers tried to give everything a sound. That made the game lively and authentic. Due to the really bad enemy sounds I give 6/10. The developers could have made it better than that.Gameplay/Handling/Equipment:     9/10It's an ego-shooter, you will get what you expect. You will spend most of the time shooting mutants and bandits. To keep the player entertained the developers wisely added some side missions to break the monotony. Besides that you can gamble, enter an extensive racing competition to win car upgrades and new cars, play cards with a ""trading card game"" or risk some fingers in the knifegame. The handling is nearly perfect. You can quickly change weapons and ammo type, draw your grenade or fix yourself up. Steering a car is really easy. The equipment is very nice. The different ammo types make the game interesting. If you are tired of normal shotgun ammo then craft explosive ones to transform your shotgun into a grenade launcher. Especially the crossbow has a lot of special bolts.Level design:     8/10The level design is pretty narrow with some exceptions. This makes the combat straightforward and the shotgun your best friend in close quarter combat. The exceptions are mostly the parts where you are driving the car. Sadly there are only two or three sniper side missions. The level routes are very interesting and sophisticated. You will have few monotonous areas in the game. The only really monotonous part is the open world which connects the mission locations.I loved the level where I had to go to the destroyed city to get the defibrilator-upgrade. It gave me a real apocalyptic feeling.Enemies/AI:     5/10The AI is relatively poor. Except for some scripted events the enemies are just charging at you or are not using the covers properly. They don't have teamwork or act structured. Well at least some enemies use special abilities like the ""octopus-like"" enemy with the hook. The enemy variety is relatively low but it doesn't really matter.Story:     3/10The beginning and the basic idea was actually cool but it seems that the developers lost their creativity in the end. You are a survivor of a meteor impact and then... well and then you have to deal with the new world. There are some people who want to use the rescue-capsule for something and you want to free the civillians from the enemy influence and make sure that the capsules don't fall into enemies' hands. I don't really get it, what's so damn important about the capsules? They missed the ""legendary"" reason to fight a big bad company. Im sad that they wasted potential here. Even I could have made a better script for a story. And the biggest disappointment awaits at the very end. No big fight (not bigger than before), noone really cares and nothing you could call an ENDBOSS. The game was made to have an endboss. I was 100% sure of it: There has to be one. But poof. Nothing at all. Borderlands 1 had a crappy Endboss but at least they developed one.Critic summary:     6,3/10Personal fun rating:     8/10     [very good game]With all it's problems and missed opportunities the game is still worth a try.If the developers make a sequel I desperately hope for them to implement an endboss.The game may not have an exciting ending (extremely boring to be honest) but the gameplay and the atmosphere at the beginning and midgame is really enjoyable.I recommend it to buy it for 10 bucks or less.

												Its basically Borderlands but with prettier graphics. The plot's a bit loose around the edges and the grand finale is both abrupt and unchallenging. It is very visual, but you're going to need a monster of a graphics card to see it in all its glory. All in all its an okay game, there are some nice touches with sub-games, racing, and tech you can build. But ultimately it feels like half a game. Its pretty short and you kinda get the feeling that there should be more. My score is a 7 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a strong single-player game and the DLC was good.  Story and action had a good blend and I never felt starving for ammo or firepower like other shooters that are strategy-heavy.  Sure, you had to mind your ammo count but I was never lacking.  Graphics and scenery were cool and it reminded me a little of Borderlands and maybe a bit of Stalker in a different situation.  I would play more DLC if they made it.  Pick it up cheap and enjoy the single-player I say!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In this game you play as Trigun.  You and your astronaut buddies get to sleep in the space shuttle, but it's actually just a set on the hoover dam.  You wake up 40,000 years later to find that the world fell apart because the UAC decided to use the Moxim bolts, instead of the higher quality Mixom.  You drive around in a mad max esque waste land, throwing propellers at guys, even though there are no boats.  The end boss of the game is John Carmaks head sewn onto a 3d high res model of Commander Keen, who throws flaming garbage cans at you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was a decent game. To start things off we'll talk about the setting. Rage is set in a post apocalyptic wasteland, the scenery is mostly vallies of stone and sand with remnants off dead trees and various other small flora like dune grasses here and there. Not a whole lot,though it is a desert like setting where water is scarce so it makes sense. The general vibe is very steam punkish with a lot of rust and metals with weapons ranging from modified crossbows to machines to plasma cannons etc.. Indoor settings are mostly tech like and/or mutatant infested sewers or a combination of the two.The graphics were well enough. I played through on medium settings and it looked good and ran rather smooth on my laptop. No blocky square head or hands, the animations weren't clunky and looked proper enough for the actions. The controls were easy enough to get accustomed too ( you can change them anyhow if you don't like them in the settings) and were accurate. They were a bit sensitive though.... During gun fights they were well enough but the cursor on menus was insanly sensitive. Straffing was very fast as well, peaking around corners for stealth turned into full blown assaults very quickly lol. The jump button was pretty pointless as well, I couldn't jump over anything at all in the game and I tried just about everything >.< .Sound was alright along with voice acting. Never had to shove my head into my screen to here characters speak or had stuttered speech. Few well known actors voiced.Haven't played alot of multiplayer yet but from what it seems it is  Racing, V.S, and Team version campaign missions from the game. All in all I loved the game and reccomend it to others. My biggest dislike was the fact that after the main quest line there is no free roam.   SPOILER:After Lassard has go you collect the I.D decryptions  just before Marshall has you activate the Ark Capsules  be sure to get all of your exploring and side quests in. After you leave wellsprings for the resistance you can go back to the other settlements at any time, prior to the last mission. As stated I advise you do for the full experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is mostly underrated if you take it for what it is- a well done first person shooter with amazing graphics and some basic driving capabilities. It could have been great if they made the world more interesting with much more life to it. As it stands the story is ok, the graphics and basic mechanics are well done, it just feels empty and does not introduce anything new to the genre. It is definately worth the sale price if you have unlimited internet and tons of hard drive space.  I managed to get 20 hours out of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 For years many First-Person shooter RPG Hybrids taken place in some wasteland has been for many of us just a regular tradition each year. With the release of Fallout and even earlier games have made it fun; Rage took up the reins of 2011 for the wasteland First-Person shooter game. Does it stack up as good as the others such as Fallout? Or would it be lost forever, post-apocalyptic style?Story/Design: The story goes that in 2029 the real life meteorite Apophis is on a direct collision mark with Earth and nearly causes mass extinction; however with the world taking precautions they start to send out volunteers in Arks with cryo-genetic hibernation. It didn't go so well, and you are the only survivor of your own particular Ark. After 106 years off that, you step out in the world for the first type, post-apocalypse...Sound familiar? Anyway, the game starts out with a great starting cinematic, yet the story is only decent, if not weak. It takes time that you can try and change the story in general and find out what exactly happened to all the other Arks. The starting point is extremely slow and it took me real motivation to try and push through it in the first hours and not completely stop the game. . Furthermore, just before the game starts to heat up and get you interested it abruptly ends. The ending is certainly jarring (and extremely disappointing) it could serve as a quality story based DLC. The game is quite beautiful though, it honestly depends on your PC though, just like any other game. With the new id tech 5 engine they say it doesn't use any of the same textures twice which is nice; however, this means that your graphics will change once you rotate the camera and will load in accordingly. This can mean textures take in at least a full second or two to load in and can make some gamers lag. It's beautiful, but as a closer look in towns you realize how fuzzy and low-style they are. Overall, I'd like to get this through to everyone, if you're buying Rage then you should NOT be buying it for the story, it's slow and disappointing and forgettable. The textures are nice while driving around, yet in towns it can a whole second or two to load in at least a simple one.Gameplay/Mechanics: This is obviously a First-Person shooter. And I'd like to say that this is a game based off its shooting mechanics and it does a fantastic job of it. It feels smooth enough and has multiple guns to choose from. The game is also a RPG mixed game, obviously trying to take from other wasteland style of games, but is nowhere near as complex as say Fallout, or even a few mechanics of Borderlands. It results in using different type of ammo, selling and trading items, building things with objects for opening doors and other objects. It's simple yet does well. It also has quests and side quests to do multiple things along with just running around, killing, or just collecting. Racing and vehicle combat is also a big part of the game, races are critical to upgrading your vehicle. The driving controls are odd though, realistic they are not and you must keep using it to feel comfortable behind the wheel. The FPS feel is great and well done, the RPG elements are simple yet for some groups can be just what they want, with more experienced RPG players it will seems a bit too simplistic for them. The vehicle combat is actually fun and is a key thing from the game. It's a fun game to play but as I said, just to play, not to hear about the story.Rage is a game not based on story; it tries and fails with disappointment. The combat and gameplay is fun and engaging. The wasteland is beautiful yet with the hiccups it might seem like an aesthetic blemish to some, yet game breaking for others. It's an above-average FPS shooter, but it's just that. Slightly above average, the same bland story as some, and not memorable as I had to force and push myself to get through it. If you want a good FPS, without good story then you can try to get this on sale. If you want story...you're going to need to find something else. 6.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Im not a fan of FPS games but i have never had so much fun shooting bandits and mutants before.If you get bored just shooting stuff you can always ride on your bungie you can get a couple of hours of fun having a race around the beautiful open landscape of this world of Rage, occassionally you will get bandits who are just jelous of your swag wagon and wanna kill you.Just a friendly tip though... when you move on to a city infested of mutants, make sure to stack up on alot of shotgun ammo.

												Rage is a fantastic shooter, id really hit a homerun with this game. The enemies are dynamic, the weapons are fun, and the gadgets are lethal. There's this great Mad Max feel to the game as you're racing around from settlement to settlement doing odd jobs and missions. The only issue I have with this game is the graphical issues that plague it. It's a fantastic game if you can run it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For me the only frustrations that arose with RAGE surrounded the fact that it comes so close to greatness.  A troubled PC launch seemed to kill the multiplayer community and the DLC adds little to the experience.  Yet even the limp ending and slim illusion of player freedom cannot hide the fact that ID know all about shooting things in the face.  That is where the fun is to be had in this game; shoot all of the things, then throw spiderbots, turrets and boomerangs into the mix.  The world and character design are enjoyable, although you never really interact with them in a meaningful way.  Whilst the racing and mini games are briefly entertaining, they prove to be little more than resource grinding.  RAGE also harbours RPG and crafting pretensions that do not get in the way, but feel strangely unimportant as a result.  If any one of these elements worked as well as the shooting, ID would have been on to a real winner here.  Just imagine what this could have been like if they had nailed them all......As it stands, RAGE has a solid core hidden amongst elements that either time, money or skill (all three?) prevented from truly coming together as a whole.  Seven out of ten seems fair, perhaps the ambition sends it a point either side of that mark, depending on how you take to the games weaker elements.  Should ID have focused their effort a little better?  Perhaps; the game shines when played with a controller and employing a gung ho approach to ammo and resource expenditure, as the title would seem to suggest.  It's just a shame that other aspects of the game never hit those heights.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great post-apocalyptic game with stunning graphics, considering it was released in 2011 it still can compete with some present games. If you like crawling around in deep tunnels of neverending sewer network, passing through abandoned city or fighting bandit clans this game is for you! Lots of minigames, including great racing system with multiple wehicle types and tons of upgrades for them this game has a bit of every post-apocalyptic rpg and pristinely combines it together. Oh did i mentioned it has cooperative missions and multiplayer. So i'm gonna take this slow, so you can unerstand it: ""Just   Buy  It!""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was a decent game. To start things off we'll talk about the setting. Rage is set in a post apocalyptic wasteland, the scenery is mostly vallies of stone and sand with remnants off dead trees and various other small flora like dune grasses here and there. Not a whole lot,though it is a desert like setting where water is scarce so it makes sense. The general vibe is very steam punkish with a lot of rust and metals with weapons ranging from modified crossbows to machines to plasma cannons etc.. Indoor settings are mostly tech like and/or mutatant infested sewers or a combination of the two.The graphics were well enough. I played through on medium settings and it looked good and ran rather smooth on my laptop. No blocky square head or hands, the animations weren't clunky and looked proper enough for the actions. The controls were easy enough to get accustomed too ( you can change them anyhow if you don't like them in the settings) and were accurate. They were a bit sensitive though.... During gun fights they were well enough but the cursor on menus was insanly sensitive. Straffing was very fast as well, peaking around corners for stealth turned into full blown assaults very quickly lol. The jump button was pretty pointless as well, I couldn't jump over anything at all in the game and I tried just about everything >.< .Sound was alright along with voice acting. Never had to shove my head into my screen to here characters speak or had stuttered speech. Few well known actors voiced.Haven't played alot of multiplayer yet but from what it seems it is  Racing, V.S, and Team version campaign missions from the game. All in all I loved the game and reccomend it to others. My biggest dislike was the fact that after the main quest line there is no free roam.   SPOILER:After Lassard has go you collect the I.D decryptions  just before Marshall has you activate the Ark Capsules  be sure to get all of your exploring and side quests in. After you leave wellsprings for the resistance you can go back to the other settlements at any time, prior to the last mission. As stated I advise you do for the full experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While this game has a lot of rough edges and if you do buy it you might want to look up some config or visual modification tools in order to make it work for you the game is well done for the most part.  While it may not be as open as some other FPS/RPG games out there it does bring a few good things to the table that others do not have.  The enemy models, animations and reaction are very well done, fluid and depending on which faction you're fighting against it might play out differently.  NPC interactions are good, and facial animations are very well done making them feel organic at times.  The story is a bit rough in places and if you've read anything about this game you will already know that the ending is well not great to say the least.  While I do wish there was more to the game then what is offered it was mostly fun while it lasted.  The tech in the game world is very nice and refreshing; the in game crafting is rather well done and very quick allowing you to use different items against different enemy types.  The game could have been better, defiantly, the story could have been a bit better and my god the texture pop in is the worst I have ever seen in my life, however it may not have entirely been iD’s fault based on what I’ve read.  Even on current gen systems you will at times get odd FPS loss and major screen tearing and if you have an ATI card you might want to look else where because I have read that people are STILL having trouble running this game.  If you can buy/find it on sale like I did when I got it, it’s well worth the money, especially once you tinker with the game engine to make it look/run a little better.  It’s far better then anything Gearbox has done to date I can honestly say that, it’s not a boring motionless world with singular friendly/peaceful NPCs, however it is no Fallout 3, it is very much in between, far better gun play then FO3 for sure however.

												The game is mostly underrated if you take it for what it is- a well done first person shooter with amazing graphics and some basic driving capabilities. It could have been great if they made the world more interesting with much more life to it. As it stands the story is ok, the graphics and basic mechanics are well done, it just feels empty and does not introduce anything new to the genre. It is definately worth the sale price if you have unlimited internet and tons of hard drive space.  I managed to get 20 hours out of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 27, 2015
												I'm a decent way in to the game now - got all the gear, fairly certain where the end game is headed. I definitely have a good feel for the features and style of the game, and while I've selected yes - I do recommend the game - that comes with several important caveats. iD have created a shooter with some really interesting ideas in RAGE. Unfortunately, it suffers from a stunning lack of ideas in many important respects, also - most of which have to do with the actual playing of the game. It's very old fashioned, in many ways, which you may view as a good thing if you're nostalgic for FPS games of old. Weapons assigned to number buttons, 1-10? Check. Unlock them in sequence, just as they're needed? Check. Tight corridors and fast enemies for shotgun splooshing? Check. Open spaces and cover loving baddies for sniper or machine gun play? Check. Oh, and here's a crossbow. Because crossbow. The enemies, while spouting some interesting dialogue, are of very limited variety, models reused with alarming frequency. Likewise, their move sets are limited. The challenge arises here in presenting you with more enemies, or sometimes enemies with higher hit points, than in providing smarter baddies. I can't think of a single interesting villian - or hero, for that matter - in the game so far. The characters are massively cliché. Attempts at making the world intimidating, or even horrifying in terms of things you see in bandit camps, are immediately undone by slapstick bad guys with cartoonish animation. Also, it's always jarring to be lectured endlessly about the dangers of this horrifying world, how every step outside the secure towns is taking your life in your hands as hordes of unspeakable monstrosities await the frothy goodness of your very blood...and then to saunter from place to place on a quad bike or stupidly heavily armed buggy without so much as an insult shouted from a nearby hillock. RAGE is not a dangerous world. Glasgow pubs are, literally and figuratively, more dangerous than RAGE. This is a game with too many ideas, some of which conflict stylistically with each other. And despite, or perhaps because of, the implementation of these ideas, other things are just left to the side. The world is very small, with some areas getting reused numerous times, just filled with different baddies. There's no true free roaming, in that you follow a limited set of canyons to a few major hubs. Occasionally you blow up a dam, or other obstruction, to unlock new canyons and a new hub. Quests are just places to go and collect things, with set pieces all along the way. A little bit on rails for a modern shooter. RAGE also features an incredibly annoying set of outdated features which aren't directly related to the gameplay. ALL the button prompts are for xBox controllers, even if one isn't hooked up. I know it's a console port, but that's just lazy and off-putting, and the mapping for controls is far from explicit about what the assigned key will do. The game actually prompts you to save on some occasions (only seen this in DLC missions so far, to be fair), stating that ""The action is about to HOT up, better save"". Any immersion you managed to achieve in this game, you just shattered with one pop-up. It may sound like griping, but the menu is just plain silly. Select quit game...get the ""Are you sure"" message. Select yes...get dumped to the opening splash screen, prompted to press enter. Press enter, get the main menu. Select quit game, and...get the are you sure window *again*. The game also features something worth special mention: The Most Pointless Weapon Upgrade Ever. Yes, the MPWUE can be found right here in RAGE! An otherwise neat little gun, the Authority LMG, features an optic with decent magnification, good accuracy, large magazines, and an armour piercing ammo variety. It's a staple, and it comes in very handy. And you can buy a laser pointer for it. Now this would be fairly useless anyway, as the shotgun takes care of anything short range and for long range - duh, optic. But the laser beam actually fades away within a few virtual inches of the gun. Even if you stand beside a wall, you realise it's just ""painted on"" - no red dot ever appears. And, and - there's an aiming reticule anyway! Granted, I've never tried disabling it. Maybe you can. Even so, this somewhat expensive upgrade feels like a lot of ideas in this game: it doesn't matter whether it WORKS, we just think it's cool. So why would I recommend RAGE? The vehicle combat between hubs actually feels pretty good. They got the feel and speed very nearly perfect. The weapons, while outlandish and old school, are very fun, especially the alternative ammunition types. Some of the town characters are kind of fun - Kvasir is a favourite, with the little cute robot head on his shoulder nodding or shaking its head along with his conversation. The crafting aspect is pretty well implemented without being intrusive. The little turrets, sentry bots, RC bomb cars and so on, are all fun to scavenge for and use. The areas you go to for missions - should have mentioned, they load up when you enter, they're not part of the open canyons directly - are well laid out, though the path is fairly linear. A little exploration is rewarded with spare parts and such. RAGE kinda sorta tries to be a more action oriented Fallout, but falls way short of the depth and story of that remarkable world. It also tries to be a single player Borderlands, a bit, and that's just absurd. A showcase of great ideas pinned on an ungainly donkey, pick it up cheap, laugh at its absurdity, enjoy smooshing mutants with an arsenal of stuff...but don't expect awe or major adrenaline rushes, nor a deep, post apocalyptic experience.

												First of all, i dont wana teach people how to write reviews or match rating with the written review.. but i must say that imo 2 points out of 10 are a question of personal taste. Not only that, but i must also say that you can review black without knowing white, same goes for saying x is great if y doesnt exist... this means that rating is possible and legit when you compare to other games in its category or atleast with similarities... With this said... i give this game a 10 and i am surprised with the low rating and reviews...Where can i start? well with the fact that, this is a bethesda game... so to those complaining about graphics.. they are perfect to me.. if you want a game to escape your CoD or Battlefield addiction dont low rate a good quality game just because graphics arent similar... On the same road, i must say that i am surprised that this marvelous fps game is from bethesda, since they are renowned for their rpgs. So it was indeed a great positive surprise for me...The shooting is great, the combat smooth, the whole idea of wasteland violence and surprise attacks is just... 10... right of the bat i got spooked out with a bandit jumping on me. The fact that ammo keeps running low is also good imo, since it adds to the difficulty (which may i say, scales awesomely well... hard to see a fps with such a great difficulty scaling(usually its either dumb dummies or headshot bots))The vehicle combat is really fun and interesting. Side quests (even though it is not an rpg) exist and are great.helpful and fun...Now... to all negative reviews.. i just gota say that, ofcourse you cant compare this game to cod or battlefield.. this game has a great story, and alot more than mere shooting, its bethesda... Comparing it to fallout is also silly, even though both are bethesda and involves wastelands, 1 is a rpg and the other fps with little rpg elements. I must say that this is also a great point for this game, the rpg elements are genious... they are just enough to maintain fps status but still give some extra stuff to do and work on.This game cannot be compared to Stalker also... Stalker is also fps true, but has way more elements of rpg.. Its a great game also, BUT simply cannot be compared to RAGE. Whole different ideas, 1 has intense combat which is cohesive to the fact that you are being hunted down, the other is honest and loyal to the idea that you are a stalker... and therefore is just existing like other stalkers (scavenging)Compare this game to metro last light... which as i reviewed... is really really unfinished. Compare both games... both fps, both of them are post apocalyptical games and both pursue the idea of intense combat. However... metro has no side quests, no minimum rpg elements... many strings that you pull only to realise there is nothing on the other end...Rage does have a story and its pretty linear... you cant simply cant get lost... if you get lost playing rage.. you should stick to basic left to right games.. STILL it manages to give you room to work on smaller stuff.. Yes the story aint deep... but tell me 5 fps games that get you immersed in its story....I sincerly find it pretty sad, to see critics unable to match their writing to their number rating. Even more to see players and pro critics alike comparing this game to cod when it comes to shooting and graphics and story to other bethesda rpg games... seriously... giving metro last joke a 8 and this game a 4.8 user rating is just ridiculous.... If you played stalker or metro the joke and like post apocalyptical fps games... Rage is an awesome surprise... dont trust ratings from people who compare it wrongly... just give it a chance... its bethesda ffs.... ID made great game aswell... why on earth wouldnt you try it?Oh and to all bug this.. crash that... graphic that"" seriously... people dont downvote jokes like darksouls for its pathetic almost unplayable pc version but will downvote this because it has better graphics on console?!? ilogical imo... The game runs fine... if by any chance you think its lagish due to low fps, press esc, go to options and there you shall find video options that you can change... judging by what i see on many reviews, this is apparently really hard to do...

												RAGE is an extremely fun shooter with a lot of fun weapons,impressive AI,and it makes great use of its somewhat limited level design by throwing interesting enemies at you,like those dudes who run on the walls and grab stuff on the ceiling and will even roll on the ground to avoid your fire.It's one of the very few good modern shooters.The health regen isn't even a handicap to the game,because there is lenty of cover and you don't have to wait for long.I might add that your view doesn't spaz out up and down like in most horrible modern first person shooters.AND YOU ARE NOT FORCED TO ONLY CARRY 2 WEAPONSThe fighting feels visceral,the animations are brilliant,there is a lot of blood and gory headshots,and when enemies explode,they leave a big splat of blood and tiny gibs go everywhere,painting the walls red.The driving aspect of the game is neither fun or interesting,and the races are absolute uninspired garbage and seems to have been thrown in there at the last minute.You'll spend your time between cool epic firefights driving back home to get new missions,and then driving to said missions.With random events like meteors made out of goodies that fall in front of you and you have to catch them.Or bandits you can fight,but it's not nearly as interesting.The vehicles only have 2 weapons,and the game auto locks on an enemy for you.They happen way too often and you should have the option to only make them spawn when you want,or be able to teleport back to town.The story is not really interesting,and gets buried deep underground by the annoying voice acting.It's not badly voiced,but it's pointless.The game takes 5 minutes to tell you ''good job,here is reward.''And you can't skip the dialogs.(or in this case,monologs) so you have to run backwards until the NPC stops talking and come back to him to hear the next part,and keep repeating this until you can finally accept the mission.One of its biggest qualities is the the level design.It's not just the ''point A => cutscene QTE cutscene QTE hide shoot hide shoot cutscene QTE point B end'' formula.There are no cutscenes during fights.Or annoying QTEs.That deserved to be said.The game uses fairly open linear levels,with a bit of exploration.The ''open world'' isn't really that open or that big,but it doesn't affect the game in a negative way.I still wonder how fun it could have been to roam around a huge map,enter a random building,and have super fast paced firefights.There is a little bit of RPG in this game,as you can collect junk,sell it,and craft stuff.Like some kind of door opening thing that will open locked doors that lead to stuff for you to get and sell/use to shoot baddies.You can also craft RC cars that go boom.Overall it's an amazing shooter with small problems that you can easily overcome.And it has fun coop!

												Un excellent FPS post apocalyptique, même si on le rush, il est quand même long à faire est il est plutot agréable.Le mode en ligne des légends du Wastland est vraiment sympa à faire, car ça retrace certaines parties du jeu solo que l'on fait à 2 dans se mode.Graphiquement il est laid mais alors très laid, le choix d'arme est plutôt excellent gameplay simple à prendre en main.Le jeu est un semi open world, niveau mission y a ce qui faut est mission secondaire aussi. Surtout, c'est très varié.Fonctionne très bien sur W10 Pro 64 bits.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's start immediately with the only thing I didn't like: weak finale. Really? Come on Id, you've a long list of weak finales (quake, quake2,doom3 was better though) but this is probably the weakest.Ok. Cons list done. Apart from that, Rage is probably a MASTERPIECE. You start being an old-era apocalypse survivor and, before you have enough time to understand what's happening you're diving in a BEAUTIFUL post-apocalyptic HUGE scenario. A world, so various that goes from broken highways to dead cities, filthy sewers and many many more.Graphics, The detail is UNBELIEVABLE, every single aspect of every map is placed carefully and planned deeply. You can almost smell the garbage in wasted garage or gasoline in Shrouded Bunker. It's awesome how level designers pay attention to every single insignificant detail. Beautiful. I didn't see any popping artifacts, I must say, Probably because my video card is very old engine just decides to use low texture by default (most of all in Dead City level apparently), which it's ok for me.Gameplay, It's id, come on, Obviously the best in town. Every shot you fire it seems that really hurts enemies, and their bodies react with damage + previous movement so it really seems that a running mutant, coming after you, after been shot to death, has still some inertia to die in front of you making two more steps. This is art, imo.I noticed they add a little ""RPG"" addition, like the possibility to buy / sell items and to create objects from blueprints but developers decided that, very wisely imo, this is an FPS and has to remain an FPS, so this is the only ""non FPS"" insertion they added.Environment. Various, huge, well detailed. East and west waste land differ very much one from the other.Open Word. The entire game level is open, sure. But, during missions, you've the sensation that there's only one way to finish the mission and one way to follow to reach the end of the level but, it's done so beautifully that imo is a pro and not a con.Summary. I really don't see a reason why not to buy (maybe in sale if it's possible) this masterpiece from ID Software. If new Doom will be at least 40% good as Rage, it will be awesome!! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most beautiful & horrible looking game I've ever seen. Looks great until it comes under scrutiny. I bought this on sale for very cheap since I ignored it on release because of it's early issues. I found it to be a solid FPS with some great driving mechanics (although driving didn't really rock my boat). Not a bad story and a couple of wow moments. The ending, although poor, looks to feed into part 2 so I would've forgiven it.. I can't see Rage 2 coming, so unforgiven :)Buy Rage when it's 3 or 4 quid and it's bob on.I did speed to the end as I had something else on the go, still took me 16 hours to push the main story. I would have gone back to finish the side quests if I'd got the option but the game denies you access once the credits roll, DLC fixes this I am told and even more DLC gives you a better and more fitting endgame.All in all; fair to good, 7 lollipops out of 10.

												I have no idea why the whiney ♥♥♥♥♥es that review games did the hatchet job on this game. Loads of fun to be had with an Electro-crossbow and bots that remind me of good dogs I've owned. Not too easy, not too hard - the TV show segment was a hoot, the bank vault episode and the Jackal level were serious fun. Not having a single issue with my hardware, I enjoyed the game - with nostalgic tips of the hat to Carmageddon, Mad Max and Duke Nukem 3D (the old 2 + 1/2 D version) I had a great old time. A nice addition to the ID stable. Three thumbs up !!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Loving this game. Much more into the Mad Max theme than Borderlands. It's like Mad Max meets Resistance. The car parts, missions and races is like your Mad Max. You even have theses guys that look like the Warboys. But than it also has Mutants which starts to feel like Resistance in the FPS parts. One mission even reminded me of Resident Evil, was a bit scary. Wish this game had more DLCs or even a more open world sequel. If your waiting for Mad Max and also played the hell out of Borderlands, try Rage. I think you'll like it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hard to believe the age of this game, the GFX are still great today and will still tax your machine for full details. This tries sooo hard to be Borderlands but falls short as no RPG level up sort of elements to it, Not a bad game by any means, I am having good fun with it so far. As with all iD games the combat is fun and the engine great.Grab if on sale, although if Borderlands 2 is on sale and you have not played that get BL2 instead with all the DLC you will not regret it.

												In this game you can carry 10 weapons (and probably unlimited ammo)  and shoot mutants along with  high-tech supersoldiers in a postapocalyptic world. You can also be a race driver with your very own cars. Pro:The combat system is excellent (these guys made the Doom series..), and I must mention, that the enemy death and combat  animations are exemplary. If I shoot somebody in the stomach, he falls to the ground, then drags himself to the nearest cover, and prepares to die. But he's still alive, so until then, shoots some bullet at you. If I hit somebody's feet, it limps, like in reality. You can be an engineer and construct items such as sentry bots and turrets. These bots are overpowered in my opinion, you can spawn 2 at the same time, and they clear the area for you. The races are exciting, but won the first place always at the first try. The minigames are also cool. Never facede any bugs (fell off the map once, but it was my fault). Contra:However, you can't really jump. Apart from the race fields, the whole game is very linear. You go into a building through the front door,  kick some♥♥♥♥♥inside, then return to that door again. And almost every single mission is like this.  The characters are boring, but their mimics and gestures are detailed. The textures sometimes look correct, but when they don't, they're ugly and low detailed. You have to save manually, because the game saves only at the beginning and the end of the mission. Forgot that when I started, and had to start again a mission. This game offers much more then 25 hours of content, in overall, it's a great FPS. If it has 75% off, or more, don't hesitate, buy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I'm gonna try to keep this short and sweet.I really liked this game it was a great FPS with more ways to kill than just unloading into a guy the weapon selection and execution was one of the best I have ever seen and the way your enemies react to them is perfection.The story is linear but it's done the right way and keeps you pretty well immersed in the game the side missions are fun but do get a bit repetitive.The graphics are decent, My PC is no where near that great so it was a little rough for me but not game breaking and the controls are great I played mostly with a gamepad but did use the mouse and keyboard some as well.The mani complaint I have about the game is the ending, the final battle wast really anything special I expected something pretty big after talking to NPC's and given the gun I was given was ridiculously huge but it was quite a let down when the fight was over and the cutscene started. As for the ending cutscene it was good and I did like it but I wish they would have shown more and explained it better and also acknowledged the fact that you had beaten The Authority after it goes back to the game to let you finish anything you wanted to do.All in all the game was great and I really liked it despite the ending seeming like they just wanted to be done with it.I do reccomend it to anyone that likes the FPS and post apocalptic style games as his was a different spin on a great genre.8/10and so mch for short and sweet oh well			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game shows off what id does best: technology and shooting.  As an FPS, it's top notch.  The guns feel great and the enemy AI is fantastic.  Each type of enemy behaves differently and gives you nice variety throughout the game.  When you go out into the open world, the vehicles feel great and combat is solid.  id also did a great job modestly expanding their usual game archetype with driving, missions, and crafting.  And most surprising, the voice acting, sound, and music are top notch.On the technology side, it is nothing short of groundbreaking.  It had a rough launch mostly due to driver issues which have since been resolved;  Now everybody can enjoy the entirely hand-painted world (check out my screenshots).  Of course the downside is, since every texture is unique, things don't look so great close-up.  But I choose to enjoy the game rather than look for faults and it's just amazing my computer can crank out 60 fps when it looks so good.Just don't expect a fantastic story.I'd also like to add how impressed I am with the DLC.  It costs $5 and has more content than most $10 DLCs while maintaining the same high quality as the rest of the game.  id managed to integrate the DLC seamlessly with the rest of the story so you never feel like you're actually playing a DLC.  The only real change is that the DLC content is significantly harder than most of the rest of the game.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed RAGE.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: November 29, 2013
												I have read pretty much everything and its opposite about that game. So I wanted to write a review, to try to give a comprehensive list of the pros/cons of that game.First of all, this game is NOT a Role Playing Game. Of course, like every single game, it can fit into its definition, since you play the role of a character in an imaginary world. Now, it is not what is conventionally accepted as a RPG. This game has no character levels, it has no skills, it has no skill-tree either of course, and so on.This game is a shooter. By the people who invented the genre, id Software. Now, if it is from the people who invented the genre, how can it only have a User Score of ""49"" (at the time of writing) on metacritic? The reason is simple: this game is really different from what id Software usually does (or did. I did not play, by far, all the id Software shooters; but I played Doom and Quake).So, what are the pros and the cons?Pros:The overall experience is rather original, refreshing, with a definitely solid and consistent shooter feeling (think of other id Software games, the weapon handling is really close to that). The id Tech 5 graphical engine is incredibly slick, does a wonderful job, and even if the textures are sometimes ugly, or even horrible, when inspected from up close; the game has really neat graphics.In addition, the world, even if not so deep (remember, this is by no mean a RPG), has some interesting aspects, and the artists did an unbelievable job making each part of it unique and authentic.Cons:id Software used to do PC games. For a company that pretty much invented the FPS genre, it was perfectly logical. Whereas I can understand why publishers decide to make every single game available on consoles, it still is a mystery for me when developers also take that direction. Not for all games, of course, Mario and Sonic were totally fitting for consoles, and so were many arcade games I played as a kid.But for FPSes, one can only wonder. I know that the fingers are probably the most precise appendices we have, but even; how can someone imagine to replace two hands with five and three fingers (for the keyboard and the mouse respectively), plus one arm (the mouse movement has more amplitude, and therefore, more precision, than a stick) by only four fingers (thumbnails and indexes), for the same result?And even if id Software managed (thanks to their extensive experience?) not to get the main gameplay cluttered by such a decision, ALL the rest of the game has been affected. Not only the interfaces.And the game also features some mandatory races, there are achievements for random games (random achievements? what's next, unobtainable achievements?), and trying to 100% the game will be an incredibly frustrating experience, for those reasons.It's also worth mentioning that the difficulty is somewhat low (that goes with the ""console"" aspect I presume: the game has to be accessible to as many people as possible), or at best inconsistent (the Scorchers DLC increased the difficulty a bit, but also gives the nail gun, which has an unlimited ammo (rebar) and a rail gun mode, allowing to see the enemies in advance, and even to kill them without exposing yourself), even in ultra nightmare (which is turning the game into a binary experience (who shoots first) rather than into a harder one), and that in spite of the obvious efforts to make the game as non-linear as possible; all the missions are constructed with the scheme: talk to X, go to Y, kill all the baddies along the way.Bottom line:The game still is worth some money, as it has a strong shooter feeling, various encounters, an awesome atmosphere. But don't expect the usual id Software FPS, it is not.Additional Note:I got an ""Anarchy edition"" (the pre-order bonus) key in order to get all the additional content. I would recommend to do the same, or at least, to unlock the pre-order content (there is a console command for that) when you play the game, as it deeply changes the gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is a first-person shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world that offers plenty of enemies to shoot, and a variety of other mini games to play.As far as the world is concerned, there will definitely be a lot of comparisons to Borderlands. It is certainly a darker, and grittier version of that world, but it is less expansive and even less characterful than Borderlands. Also, the game tries to progress the story through a series of quest-givers to make it feel even more like Borderlands, however without any of the RPG elements such as character progression, talent trees, or loot, it seems out of place. In fact, because there are no RPG elements, the story could have been presented in a much more immersive way. The game tries to add in other diversions to make the world feel more immersive. Crafting allows you to create various gadgets and weapons, but you can easily get through the game without crafting anything. Often, it is simply easier to just buy whatever you want instead of crafting it. There are a variety of mini-games, including a card game where you can collect cards found throughout the world. However, not everyone in this world plays it. In fact, only a very few NPCs play this game, and they can be beat without finding all the ""best"" cards, so it takes the incentive away from trying to hunt down the cards. The game also tries to shoehorn in a driving aspect and even lets you upgrade all the parts of the vehicle: and you can only get these upgrades through a currency you get from racing. But in the end, the racing is not really challenging nor particularly fun. So finally, that leaves the shooting element of the game. There are certainly many enemies to shoot in this game. But none of your guns seem to pack a visceral punch. They don't sound or feel strong enough, and even when at point blank range with a shotgun, most average-grunt enemies still require 2 to 3 shots to down. All-in-all, Rage is a game that has many dimensions, but none of them are fleshed out particularly well. If you are a fan of first person shooters, you may find some interest in playing through this title, but it's certainly not going to be a title you will have a great experience playing, nor will it be particularly memorable. It's pretty much the definition of ""middle of the road.""5/10 ""Mediocre""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely abysmal port; worse texture pop-in than Mass Effect 1, extreme mouse acceleration (that resets itself even when changed in the config files), and frequent dips in framerate to around 15 fps on lowest settings (on a rig that runs Metro: Last Light on high at a solid 60) all make the game virtually unplayable. It's possible that these are only issues on AMD cards, but either way, do your research before buying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At every possible moment this game threatens to become a good shooter.  There's really no reason it shouldn't be.  It's got a gorgeous graphics engine, entertaining guns... what else do you need?  Oh right.  What we don't have here is pacing, good level design or interesting enemies.  On top of that the game just decides to end at one arbitrary point.  On my first playthrough I got through the whole game without ever firing the game's 'super weapon'.  I was saving it for a climactic boss fight or final level that never actually came.Too easy, as well.  I played through on nightmare and felt no sense of accomplishment having beaten it whatsoever.

												I would definitely recommend buying this game. It has a very Mad Max vibe and provided hours of entertainment. There is a standard FPS weapon spread (pistol, shotgun, SMG, AR, etc) and a fair variety of enemies to shoot at. I found the story to be standard post apocalypse fair but this games take on it is good. There is a decent amount of sidequests and even some races both with and without weapons to provide some more thrills. Vehicles and weapons can be customized as the story progresses. There is also decent multiplayer based off events that take place during campaign to keep you going after the campaign is finished.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(review for single-player only)RAGE is a strange game. It's a mash-up of different scenarios that doesnt really fit together. It's one part Combat Cars Racing game, one part Mad Max, one part Steam, one part Zombie fps and a small but significant part sci-fi. If the dev's had only stuck to one or two and then really seen that through, it would have been great.The mechanics are good, the main story is ok to a start, side stories and quests are easy to find and do, character progression is ok, but not great but somewhere in mid-game, the devs just stopped working and the result is not what the game could have been.Too bad really, I really liked it the first hrs.It's not really a bad game, I just got really disapointed after awhile.Buy it on sale if you wanna shoot stuff in a mad max futuristic steamish world, and race cars at the same time.

												There is a lot of things I dislike about this game, but I still quite enjoy playing it. But there is some things that just irritates me about it. Let's start of with what I dislike.Negative:*You do not have an in-game town/world map, kind of sucks cause I'm one of those guys who likes to explore everything and check off certain areas as ""done"" with memorizing the areas through world map. On the other hand the game seem to be so linear that you don't need one.*The jump seems worthless, there are obstacles in the game that's not even up to your knees that you can't jump across, which makes me think ""why did they even give you the option to use jump at all?"". You can't even climb over desks, or big windows with stuff in it, you have to get a lock grinder or whatever it's called to blow up the door. That's so poor.*A headshot with the crappy pistol doesn't kill the enemy, not even 1 feet away. A bullet through the skull on a human being should kill him. (And no, I do not mean the guys with helmets)*The co-op was a bit dissapointing and really short, I was expecting being able to play full campaign with my brother and not some short missions. Maybe I did my research badly before purchasing the game.*Using bandages or creating them seem to be quite useless. I mean you do regenerate full health by just not getting shot anwyay and if you badly need a bandage you're probably screwed over anyway cause you need to swap to the bandages from whatever you're currently using, like HE grenades or whatever. A heal button is missed in those scenarios, like pressing ""H"" on your keyboard.*The mouse feels bad when you're in the menu, checking inventory, quests and things like that. Feels like it's lagging.*In combat you can't lean!! I hate that you can't lean and take cover, best you can do is to crouch behind a desk or things a like and just stand up to shoot and then sit again. I think it's rreally poor that you can't lean when your opponents can do all kind of stuff, lean, jump over desks, climb though windows, take their arm up with gun only shooting at you while taking cover.Postive:*The vehicles looks good and are fun to drive.*The FPS is overall nice, except you can't lean!*The enviroments and graphics are okay for being a couple of years old game, don't see why people complain over it really.*The enemies move good and make up for the lack of leaning.*Quests are OK.Overall, there is more negative things to say about the game then positive.I would recommend this game at a low price on sale, but no chance of getting it at it's full price, there for I do NOT recommend buying this game. It kills some time sure, but if you're out after a good fps game, spend your money on something else. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just another spam spawning, bullet sponge rail shooter with mediocre graphics and AI.Honestly, Rage is a step backward from the 2009 release of Wolfenstein.As with every other iD installment, area triggers spam in mobs, even in areas you just cleared. The term ""one clip, one kill"" applies here, as mobs which aren't mutants will require a full magazine pumped into them to take them down. It takes a minimum of two head shots from the sniper rifle, which is just a forced waste of ammo. One human enemy in white armor took 3 and 1/2 magazines of ammo to drop, and that was at 5 paces using short controlled bursts so no bullets missed. It was not a boss, but just a trash mob bad guy.Graphics.I keep seeing people praising the graphics of this game, but cannot see why. I got it shortly after it was released, and even then it was sub par compared to other titles. Sure, outdoor scenes can look quite picturesque overall, but the moment you get near any items, their mediocre look really shows. It's as if, even when on the highest graphics settings, that Mipmap number 2 is being used. Some items in the game haven't even been properly UVW mapped, so they just have distorted, splotchy pixels on them. I feel this is a symptom of iD being bought out by Bethesda. Several of us had been discussing whether Bethesda would bring iD down, or iD would bring Bethesda up back when iD was acquired. Unfortunately, Bethesda won, and iD's quality has suffered.Maybe it's due to the game being a port, but that is just breaking the 8th commandment of good game development and not an excuse for releasing a bad looking game on the PC.Gameplay and AI.The game handles like your average iD game. Mouse wheel through some of the guns (have to hit the numbers on the keyboard to access the rest), shoot spamming mobs of respawning bad guys, run out of ammo and punch the rest to death while strafing backward. Grab quest item and repeat. The formula worked better in the original Doom.The AI seems like it wants to work, but frequently just starts bouncing bad guys around until you Whack-A-Mole them to death one or two bullets at a time. After an hour in game, it becomes apparent that the AI is sorely lacking, and the game becomes painfully redundant and predictable. Maybe I just played too many iD titles over the decades.If you like redundant rail shooters with mediocre graphics, AI and love spamming hordes coming and going, then grab this game. If you want any kind of sophistication or thought provoking gameplay, avoid it like the plague.After thought.iD attempted to include aspects of all types of genres, and did manage to mix them together well. They even included card games. So you have rail shooter, racing/demolition derby, platformer/killhouse, Magic cards all in one game. I don't play Magic or Borderlands because I don't like Magic or Borderlands. I bought Rage because I thought I was getting another Doom style experience according to their hype. Nope.

												First things first.  If you do not like arcade style play do NOT buy this game!  There are certain sections early on that require arcade play and a must win (Dusty 8 Race) before you can progress any further.  If you can't hammer away at these sections you're done playing the game (which is where I am now).The FPS portion of the game is great.  Fun weapons and very challenging.  It is unfortunate that many encounters are proximity triggered so there's not as much sneaking up on the enemy as I personally prefer.  Great for those 'run in and kill' player style folks though.The monetary system is a bit of a challenge early on, but as with most games it gets easier.  Some of the side betting games in Wellsprings help.  On the downside, I think there are too many games within the game.  They're nice distractions I guess, but they don't lend to the storyline (as far as I got that is).The explorable world is really not all that big.  This is not some large open map, but rather a nicely textured backdrop in which missions are narrowly bracketed into the surrounding landscape.  It takes little to no time to find the outer boundaries of the map in each mission.  No climbing over the boulders, sneaking around, and getting the lay of the land before you proceed around that blind curve... you're just gonna have to proceed. In as much as the previous mission areas remain open, creating an ever expanding environment... ""vast"" hardly describes your gameplay area.The flexibility in assigning key controls is good.  I prefer to keep as much as possible on the keypad and the number of commands allows things to fit nicely.  The graphics are beautiful.  The responsiveness in game (on my machine anyway) is great!I can't recommend the game though.  The game description does not accurately reflect the limitations in play and as I noted previously, there's no clear mention of game stops at arcade style missions much less mention of arcade play at all.  Had I known they existed I would never have purchased the game.  After a mixed bag of high enjoyment in FPS and extreme disappointment and frustration in arcade play the game will be unloaded and placed in the virtual trashcan.There are those that will greatly enjoy the mix of play.  To you I tip my hat!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An ideal game for someone like me. Non linear in most places, linear in some, story driven, GREAT characters, even greater animations, solid gameplay + good focus on combat.The game is immense. It really plays as good as it looks and that's rare in most games. The levels are vast and detailed and the weapons and gadgets are loads of fun to upgrade and play around with. There's a good mix of linear and non linear gameplay which means that there's an equal amount of attention to the story and the rpg aspect (rpg's usually have a not so deep story).Although it's post apocalyptic, it's seriously original and the detailed environments and genuine atmosphere prove this.

												I don't know, Rage isn't all that bad. The game does look great, but there are so many technical issues that prevented me from truly enjoying it. The fact that V-sync, at first, wasn't implemented was a bad choice. The texture pop-in was awful as well. Combine this with the freezing problem (every few minutes the game freezes for at least 1-2 seconds) and I'm sure you'll understand what I mean.The gameplay itself is like any other shooter. With some added RPG elements. You'll  collect a lot of worthless junk (which is a shame) and complete simple, sometimes fun, quests. But since there is no real reward for the sidequests there isn't much incentive to do them at all. You'll gain money and some licenses for your vehicle, but no weapons, schematics or anything else. Not even XP. So in the end there's no feeling you're getting any stronger. A missed opportunity. The driving segments are actually ok, but quite easy.Anyway, I did have fun with it, but I expected more to be honest.[Rating: 81/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best way I can sum up Rage is... if you are interested in playing Rage, you've already played this game. It is the next generic post-apocolypse shooter. It's like the sampler appetizer that has just a little bit of pieces of other games. However, this is the best looking of these games. Some of the textures look like total crap, but some areas and vistas look very nice. The game does take a lot of hard drive space for a fairly short game. Overall, it wasn't bad. It took around 13 hours to finish. The story is generic. Most of the combat is done in linear corriders. I didn't care for the hit detection when shooting enemies. Shoot them once and you gotta wait to shoot them again or the hit won't register. A lot of bullets and time were wasted having to wait through the AI recovery  god frame animations so the next bullet will register. Most of the exploration is done with vehicles that let you travel the map. I'd recommend getting Rage if it's on sale and you want some mindless fun. It is unremarkable in every way, but I still managed to have some fun with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I suppose this game was okay, and the mechanics were pretty good, but I couldn't stand listening to the characters. The voice-acting is okay, but I hated how I couldn't skip the boringness of the dialogue when picking up a quest. It's not so bad at first, and then it just gets so boring and I do not care about the story. I liked playing it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personal Rating: 6 of 10Good graphics but linear and repetative gameplay and story. There are almost zero customization in the game except for fixed weapons and vehicles upgrades and ammo types. Do take note that this is a ported game from console and its really buggy with choppy graphics specially when running on ATI graphics card. There are some alternatives out there but it won't resolve the issue completely. If you are looking for the Anarchy Edition, try third party legitimate website for the DLC pack.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wanted to hate RAGE, but I couldn't help having a fun time anyway. From the feeling that its a tech demo first and a half hearted entry into a new franchise second, this game is one of missed opportunities and shows how far behind the competition id Software has gotten when it comes to designing memorable experiences. Blurry textures and pop in are a small price to pay when you realize how beautiful and revolutionary MegaTexture streaming actually is from a technical standpoint. On the artistic front there's some truly standout character design and setpieces, but again, they're used only as excuses for shooting galleries. I suspect the lukewarm reception to RAGE stems from people expecting something along the lines of an open-world RPG with idTech behind it: an amazing proposition indeed, but not what this game actually is. It's a punchy shooter with amazing animation (seriously, shoot a bandit and watch him dance) with the smallest concessions to RPG design, paired with a surprisingly robust vehicular combat component. The plot is shockingly thin, unresolved and downright lazy towards the final act. The game does more of its world building through visual shorthand rather than exposition, and its cliched post-apocalypse is better at conveying pixels and polygons than real heart and soul.You'd never mistake this for Borderlands or Fallout, and while it lacks the variety and breadth of its distant cousins, it's still very much its own experience, and one that's worth playing through at least once (and probably only once).

Driving segment in the game controls good with Keyboard.  You can also craft items that you picked up on missions or just wandering.  You can craft medkits, bullets, weapons, etc.  Get Rage and Witness the Shotgun with the Special ID Sauce!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So i finished RAGE for a third time, finally on steam as perfect game. Great idea of story, only shame they nailed end like that. Storyline has medium lenght (approx. 25hr), couple of sidequests, not very exciting, basically, just repeating already completed location reversed etc. I really want to appeal on main story quests environment and sceneries and hardest game difffficulty, its quite hard from beginning (like death on 2-3 hits, need to be very carefull), but right after purchasing first, second armor upgrade its basic game difficulty.Next BIG plus is ARENA, RACING and MINIGAMES, especially minigames are very funny and challenging.Graphic is a bit less anime than Borderlands, so haters of BL dont be scared of it. More music would be appreciated.Multiplayer - Racing and derby would be fun, but no one plays it.CO-OP missions are very funny, BIG plus for the maps of coop missions (Wellspring street fights, or reversed demolished arena etc.).DLCs - Scorchers dlc is very worthy, contains big storyline, new, freaking OP weapon (Ultra nightmare difficulty is a bit easier from the beggining with that gun), and hard enemies. Also very hot lead character Sarah <3 xDAchievements - Perfect game could be done in one run (only Jetpack achievement requires lower difficulty). I dont like MP racing achievements (2) where u need to be in four players (coop achievements /4/ requires only 1 aditional player), and since nobody plays it, theres just chance u will find someone on steam game discussions. Few PROS- no inventory limit- plenty of zombies (especially sewers missions)- not pointlessly giant map ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's unfortunate that RAGE has been subjected to so much negativity. I'm not sure what the origins of it are. Perhaps people expected something different, perhaps people expecting something more on some level because it was the next big game by id. I always loved RAGE. Pretty much everything about it. It plays superbly, being one of the few shooters I've ever played where firing a weapon actually feels powerful and great. It has AI that, while not smart in the sense that FEAR did, they are fun to fight because they move so oddly and realistic at times. I just started playing the new DOOM today and that game is just not for me. Having to search the environment to find something specific is just so boring in that game. I recognize that DOOM just isn't doing something that I like. In the same way I feel that RAGE was subjected to such criticism because it did something a lot of people didn't like. But it is a fantastic game if you like the thing it's going for, because it nails it.(For the record, I played RAGE on 360 when it came out. Intending to play it now on PC, which is why my play time is effectively 0 hours as of this writing).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is a great quick first person shooter with a lot more added in. The racing and minigames are fun diversions, and I recommend playing the coop mode Legends of the Wasteland. It gives more backstory on the various characters you met throughout the campaign, and is a quick but fulfilling playthrough. Don't expect a revolutionary gameplay experience, but this game will satisfy any first person shooter fan.7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I acquired RAGE on a sale, and for the price I paid, I'd recommend the experience.  The world is gorgeous, in a post-apocalyptic, Fallout-like style, with some obvious Fallout-like ripoffs.  Still, it's worth it just to experience some of the really immersive visuals.  The characters and people are reasonably good, beautifully crafted, fully voiced with a variety of personalities (even if some of the acting is forced).  Also, the first ""Dead City"" experience was really memorable.The game is largely good, but suffers from a lack of direction and from trying to do & to be too much.  The crafting system is interesting and provides some value, but largely unnecessary to complete the game.  The various minigames, too, are value-added, but in the same way that finding spare change in your pocket is value-added.  The vehicles actually drive very nicely and are enjoyable, and the vehicular combat isn't bad, but the entire racing circuit side-game is virtually mandatory and--as such--is a detriment.The game is arguably broken up into three sections, by ""hub"".  The first and third sections are really short, while the second is probably over-long.  The first section, being short, makes sense.  Its an intro to the game; the starting quest hub.  The brevity of the third hub, however, and the entire third section of the storyline--including the anticlimactic end stage and ending--feels shockingly unfinished, especially compared with some real gems in the section section (Wellspring), most notably the first visit to the Dead City.Ultimately, I'd recommend the game, if only to experience the first half to two-thirds of it.

												I like this game. It is a few years old now but the graphics are still fairly good overall. Overall it is a first-person shooter style game, but they added in a driving/racing aspect that not only seems to work fairly well, but to me adds a degree of realism to a post-apocolyptic world that so many other games seem to lack. And unlike some other games, while you can just walk around out on the main map; taking the buggy or the monarch to drive around definitely gets you there both faster and safer. There is a good amount to do in this game aside from the main quest line in the form of side quests and challenges, as well as several easter eggs from the older id software games that are just kinda cool to collect.Now for the bad. Thw game is fairly linear overall. You can miss out on things by progressing the main storyline too far too fast, and I'm not a big fan of that in open-world games. It's not too bad as long as you do optional side quests first then the main 1 but on initial playthrough it might not be obvious. Also, might just be because I'm late to the party, as in I did not buy this game when it was brand new, but there is never anybody on the multiplayer side of this so I can't unlock the rest of my acheivements. not a huge deal, but a little disappointing.Overall, like I said, I really do enjoy the game. I would rate the overall experience as about a 7 out of 10. Definitely worth trying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The world is gorgeous, in a post-apocalyptic, Fallout-like style, with some obvious Fallout-like ripoffs.  Still, it's worth it just to experience some of the really immersive visuals.  The characters and people are reasonably good, beautifully crafted, fully voiced with a variety of personalities (even if some of the acting is forced).  Also, the first ""Dead City"" experience was really memorable.The game is largely good, but suffers from a lack of direction and from trying to do & to be too much.  The crafting system is interesting and provides some value, but largely unnecessary to complete the game.  The various minigames, too, are value-added, but in the same way that finding spare change in your pocket is value-added.  The vehicles actually drive very nicely and are enjoyable, and the vehicular combat isn't bad, but the entire racing circuit side-game is virtually mandatory and--as such--is a detriment.The game is arguably broken up into three sections, by ""hub"".  The first and third sections are really short, while the second is probably over-long.  The first section, being short, makes sense.  Its an intro to the game; the starting quest hub.  The brevity of the third hub, however, and the entire third section of the storyline--including the anticlimactic end stage and ending--feels shockingly unfinished, especially compared with some real gems in the section section (Wellspring), most notably the first visit to the Dead City.Ultimately, I'd recommend the game, if only to experience the first half to two-thirds of it.

												Visceral - an impressive thrill-ride. Starts off gently but ramps up pretty quickly and sucks you into a very real post-apocalyptic world. Some crafting, many varied mission types. Enemies just get more varied and nastier as you go. I'm officially addicted to this game. Will be getting the extra content when I finish the base game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know, Rage isn't all that bad. The game does look great, but there are so many technical issues that prevented me from truly enjoying it. The fact that V-sync, at first, wasn't implemented was a bad choice. The texture pop-in was awful as well. Combine this with the freezing problem (every few minutes the game freezes for at least 1-2 seconds) and I'm sure you'll understand what I mean.The gameplay itself is like any other shooter. With some added RPG elements. You'll  collect a lot of worthless junk (which is a shame) and complete simple, sometimes fun, quests. But since there is no real reward for the sidequests there isn't much incentive to do them at all. You'll gain money and some licenses for your vehicle, but no weapons, schematics or anything else. Not even XP. So in the end there's no feeling you're getting any stronger. A missed opportunity. The driving segments are actually ok, but quite easy.Anyway, I did have fun with it, but I expected more to be honest.[Rating: 81/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished this plus the DLC and I have to say I enjoyed it quite a lot. It is an amazing FPS experience with a lot more to it than other big FPS games, it's pretty long, with a lot of stuff for you to play around with.I get that numerous people have had technical problems in the past, but most of them didn't at all apply to me, even the infamous texture pop-in wasn't present in my case, with some of the settings tweaked. Even my potato (GT635M) could handle the game at most graphical options high without dropping bellow 35-40FPS.I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, fresh, FPS experience. It's sad that the game was plagued by numerous technical issues upon launch and most people just gave up on it. Just don't go in expecting a more actiony version of Fallout, instead appreciate the effort put into all the different little details and you're gonna have a good time. This isn't an open world game and is quite linear despite giving you the freedom to explore the wasteland. Think of it as an open linear game if that makes sense and I doubt you're going to be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hmm what to say...Well at first I saw this game as a Fallout 3/Boardlands rip off. Because of the fact we're in a distopian future, there are vaults and people want to get to the vaults. Game also seems kinda sexist as every woman (apart from elderly woman) I dressed with no tops besides a thin bikini or one-trap bra ann the either wear shorts or jeans in the rare cases.So...good things about the game:*Your weapons have a varied types of ammo such as armour peircing rounds or explosive on some weapons.*The opening of the story is very engaging and interesting, thought your character being a silent protagonist doesn't add to it.*You end up straight into the action, but not in too much of a jarring way.*There are many side-missions and minigames to earn cash such as bulletin board, gambling and others.*You have a crafting system*it's a lot of fun.*You are not stuck to one vehicle and get to change to more advanced ones as you go.However there are many bad parts.*The characters are all quite forgettable*There aren't nearly enough side-missions as Boardlands, which does in a way make it more enjoyable.*The rendering is HIDIOUS. I bought this game late in the date. It's been out for 2 years and they havn't fixed the horrible rendering? If you move around a corner too fast all the textures become blobs and enemies, in a few cases, dissappear until the texture loads up.*There is a lag at times, which means you can miss a good shot or, most frustraitingly, you can mess up at five-fingered fillet.*The story, whilst started strong, has a very lack-luster ending.*Numerous bugs, including a loss of sound leading to watching the end movie on youtube because it cut out and was silent.*Despite your character never been seen in 3rd dimensions apart from end of mutant bash, you cannot customise your character nor does he appear to have a name.*SOME weapons are upgradable, but not many.Over-all it's a fun game and I found myself addicted to playing it, having fun decapitating people with the wingsticks and so on. Despite it's many errors, I would recommend it, if you were just after a fun fps to burn off steam. However if you're looking for something better in storyline then I suggest something more along the lines of Half-life or Portal or even System Shock. It's sad to see Id Software♥♥♥♥♥♥this out with Bethesda. At times there seemed to be good ideas, but at other times they either aren't expanded upon enough or fall flat. Almost like Id Software had a suggestion, Bethesda tried it, then failed misirbly and didn't even put any effort into it.One final thing, this game was obviously made for a controller. You cannot scroll through all your weapons, only 4 pre-sets which, based on the shape, probably are accessable with the D-pad. If anything get this game on a sale and only if you have no other FPSs to play. However there are many funny Id software easter eggs in there :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An ideal game for someone like me. Non linear in most places, linear in some, story driven, GREAT characters, even greater animations, solid gameplay + good focus on combat.The game is immense. It really plays as good as it looks and that's rare in most games. The levels are vast and detailed and the weapons and gadgets are loads of fun to upgrade and play around with. There's a good mix of linear and non linear gameplay which means that there's an equal amount of attention to the story and the rpg aspect (rpg's usually have a not so deep story).Although it's post apocalyptic, it's seriously original and the detailed environments and genuine atmosphere prove this. I cannnot believe only 7 people on my friends list have this game! :D9/10 (because no game can be completely perfect ^_^)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game isn't terrible, but it has too many faults to be worth buying in this day and age, where we have so many great games out there. -After a certain point in the game, maybe 7 hours in, I started to get dizzy whenever I played it. Once I beat the area where it all began, I was fine again. However a bit later it came back, and it turns out that a lot of areas in the last half of the game, just induse dizziness. -Enemies soak up bullets so much! I expect 30 bullets to mean I potentially have 30 kills in my magazine, if I get headshots. In Rage this means 1 kill, maybe 1 kill and injuring another enemy. Boring as ****-It is super linear, and you get no choices anywhere, except for what weapons to use and what upgrades to put on your car.-There is no sensitivity option for your mouse, so you just end up sliding all across the menu, never getting the mouse where you want it to be.It's okay to play and certainly not the worst I've had, but it could have been done so much better.

												Lackluster and anticlimatic are about the right words that can be used to sum up this game.The combat is decent. It's nothing awe inspiring, but it holds its own. The AI seems a little smarter than the norm, as it will allow squads of enemies to work as teams to advance, retreat, or attempt to outflank the player. It has its holes that can be exploited and sometimes does some dumb things, but for the most part provided for satisfying combat.Car combat can be a little frustrating due to clunky controls. It also seems to serve no point other than a novelty or to disguise the game world to seem more open and exansive. It is mostly a boring affair that wouldn't have been missed if it was not in the game.There is an illusion of an open world, but the game areas are actually quite linear. There are many side missions that seem pointless and unrewarding. It probably didn't help that rewards were mysterious and the game is not very forthcoming in communicating what they were. They also tell little about the world you are in. Very thin and bland and could easily be avoided, in favor of sticking with the main mission, without much loss to the experience whatsoever. The game world itself felt rather shallow and it was difficult to relate to or care about anyone or anything within it.Lastly, and probably my biggest gripe, the game just seems to abruptly end in a very anticlimatic fashion. There really wasn't any real main antigonist in the game. You hear rumors and details of the promise of some kind of rival that the player may have to face, but none of it ever comes to fruition. There is never even a single encounter, dialogue, or anything with a supposed main antagonist. The ending of the game lacks any kind of boss encounter at all, even though it leads the player to believe that one should be expected. It's as if the developers ran out of time and resources to flesh out anything the game teases the player with and just abruptly ends. Very lackluster and disappointing, nearly feeling like a waste of time.Only get it if you have a serious hankering for a single player FPS and you've played everything better already. Only get it on sale as well. Or better yet, save your time and play something better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So i finished RAGE for a third time, finally on steam as perfect game. Great idea of story, only shame they nailed end like that. Storyline has medium lenght (approx. 25hr), couple of sidequests, not very exciting, basically, just repeating already completed location reversed etc. I really want to appeal on main story quests environment and sceneries and hardest game difffficulty, its quite hard from beginning (like death on 2-3 hits, need to be very carefull), but right after purchasing first, second armor upgrade its basic game difficulty.Next BIG plus is ARENA, RACING and MINIGAMES, especially minigames are very funny and challenging.Graphic is a bit less anime than Borderlands, so haters of BL dont be scared of it. More music would be appreciated.Multiplayer - Racing and derby would be fun, but no one plays it.CO-OP missions are very funny, BIG plus for the maps of coop missions (Wellspring street fights, or reversed demolished arena etc.).DLCs - Scorchers dlc is very worthy, contains big storyline, new, freaking OP weapon (Ultra nightmare difficulty is a bit easier from the beggining with that gun), and hard enemies. Also very hot lead character Sarah <3 xDAchievements - Perfect game could be done in one run (only Jetpack achievement requires lower difficulty). I dont like MP racing achievements (2) where u need to be in four players (coop achievements /4/ requires only 1 aditional player), and since nobody plays it, theres just chance u will find someone on steam game discussions. Few PROS- no inventory limit- plenty of zombies (especially sewers missions)- not pointlessly giant map ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really would like to recommend this game, but I can't. It gives me headaches, no kidding. There is something wrong with the perspective, FOV, movement of objects, I don't know. Even adjusting the FOV by entering startup parameters doesn't help.Maybe it's the buildup of the textures every time I move: I turn arround, low quality textures are loading, looking back, low quality textures are loading, and so on. After 30 minutes I get dizzy and have to quit.I tried to like the game, but I can only play it casually.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is a very good post-apocalyptic game - a veritable fusion of Fallout and Borderlands.I'm a big fan of Fallout, Borderlands bit smaller (but always xD), post-apocalyptic game stoke in my veins for a long time - I love the atmosphere.When I learned the game RAGE is available on the PC, which is based on schemes such games as Fallout and Borderlands - we had to look at this title closely.- Initially the game it was a massacre, but:RAGE, unfortunately, was initially bad optimized for the PC, texture errors occur today (are less intrusive, but they are perceived), CPU 100%, Bugs and jams / hang-ups - are problems that PC gamers received a start. I have a powerful computer, and the above problems experienced in person - on yet another powerful hardware was the same.Today, it is already well but minor bugs related to graphics (textures) sometimes happen.- Okay now time to move on to the more pleasant part of describing the game.Plots game is great, but i shall not say anything about it. :)Graphically, the game looks very good, beautifully but darkly, like a post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The music is nice, it's OK. Map of the world large, open, move along it mainly vehicles (because after every run xD). Opponents of the computer on high (Nightmare) difficulty are strong, fast, difficult to hunt. - With bosses and mini-bosses no longer remember xDCrafting system is good, the collected things on the map create useful us the tools to fight / break in this hostile us world - weapons, ammunition, dressings etc. Missions major and minor are pleasant, varied so you will not be bored - and for the execution of them get cash (+ special additives), which can be spent on in-store purchases, improve our vehicle.Polish Dubbing, because this version I have the pleasure to have - is good, you can safely compare it to that of Fallout 3.To summarize the above, the game RAGE had a difficult beginning to the PC, but now it is a game in which you need to play - is simply very good.I surely recommend!

												I like it so far. Car combat is very boring compared to borderlands. However the guns are fun to use. The graphics look good. Not all the stuff in game looks good. Some stuff does look blurry close up. Phones for an example. However overall it looks good for its age. My main complaint is the dumb save system. Grrrrr. Your forced to save every 10 to 20 minutes unless you like starting over from the start of a mission. Ugh. If your looking for a good first person shooter then this is a solid choice.Ok just finished the game. Took me 12 hours for just the main game. I own the DLC so I am starting on that part next. You get a nail gun. The ending for the main game is lame like everyone says. But until then its mostly good fun. I still hate the races. Ugh.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm kinda split on this game. It's fun, but only in places. It feels somewhat like pulling a cookie out of dirt and trying to eat it. The cookie is still delicious, but it sucks to have to chew dirt. And there isn't a lot of cookie and plenty of dirt. Another analogy, Borderlands without the loot and RPG system, but with slightly better gunplay. Only slightly better.My PC is a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥ so I had a fortune to experience the game the way it was intended: with textures loading out of blurry mess right in front of my eyes (sarcasm alert). Megatextures, and the game's graphics overall, look great in static, but not that great in dynamic. Apart from the aforementioned problem with megatextures, there is a problem with inconsistent quality. Or rather, high quality where it doesn't matter and low quality where it does.  You'll ride by gorgeous canyons and small graffities that you won't even notice, to then have to stare at ugly bushes and muddy wall textures when fighting indoors. The combat is a bit fun. The gunplay feels nice, that's the only thing where I could see the id's fingerprints. Other than that, there isn't much good to say about it. Overall, the combat borrowed too much from cover shooters and was clearly designed for consoles. Guns are underpowered and there seems to be a great reliance on melee and special items.The control scheme is ♥♥♥♥ed, because it was made for consoles. Rebinding doesn't help much. Instead of having separate keys for healthpacks, grenades and wingsticks, they are all grouped as ""quick items"" and you have to switch between them before using them. And you also have different ammo types that you have to switch between. And you have ADS and melee buttons, which you'll have to use. I don't know why anyone would need healthpacks though. The game uses this atrocious no healthbar, bloody screen, hide to heal system. I thought it has already been prohibited in one of the UN conventions. If it hasn't, it should be. The guns are pretty inaccurate, unless you ADS. The grunts constantly move around and the combat distances are pretty low.  There is a lot of opportunity for melee and a special melee attack button. If you don't use melee, you'll run out of ammo pretty fast, because guns are inaccurate and don't deal a lot of damage, and because the enemies are either behind cover or in a jerky movement. They can also shoot from behind the cover, which you can't do. The classic strafe dance gunfight doesn't work either, because the guns are inaccurate and low damage, enemies move unpredictably and can close the distance rapidly if they want, or hide behind cover and shoot from behind it, and because there isn't much space to strafe around and the floors are uneven so you won't have a steady aim. I think I'm ranting already. If you can try it for free, do it. See if you enjoy it before buying it. I didn't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most disappointing aspect of this game for me is the hit detection on the enemies.  Too often, when my first bullet would hit an enemy they went into an animation telling me they were hit, and then my second bullet seemed to do nothing because it couldn't disrupt the animation.  Meaning that I always wound up using a ton of ammo just on normal enemies where, despite my relative accuracy, only so many bullets actually made contact.  On top of that, the structure of the level design for the shooting portions was a tiresome repeat of enemies ambushing the player, there were next to no times when you would come upon enemies just hanging around giving you the option of first contact.  Enemies only ambush you.  Very disappointing for a game by an acclaimed FPS studio.  I wanted to like it but the shooting gameplay was simply not fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The PC version of this game is horrible.  First off, the port was a complete disaster.  The tutorial and on-screen hints are all based on controller schemes.  I.E.  Screen will tell you to press the ""A"" button to open a door, and the same button to enter a garage with your car, but in a keyboard, each function is bound to a different key.  So you're standing there pressing every key to figure it out.  ""Check the bindings on the settings screen."" you say?  Well, good luck there cause it doesn't tell you anything there.Second, the texture resolution seem stuck on low, and you have to do some googling/hacking to get a slight improvement, which still looks like garbage.Finally, and the worst crime of all, there is barely ANY content in this game.  It's barely longer than a playable demo.  There are only 2 main towns, and about 10 side quests, and maybe 15 or so main quests.  The expansion DLC's are both just mediocre.  And one of the extra weapons you get is not bound to a number by default!Not worth the money, even when it on sale for like $6.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A truly underrated gem.RAGE is a visceral first-person shooter with vehicular combat.Many mistake the game for an open world-type; RPG. It does implement RPG elements in the vehicle and gun categories - allowing you to upgrade and customize your guns and vehicle the way you want to play. Each unique gun has multiple types of ammunition to kill mutants with, and the vehicle comes with many different options such as turrets, mines and rocket launchers. The game is somewhat ""open world"", but in a linear fashion - i.e., there are only so many places you can go and the canyons between factions usually provide more of a driving segment than a trek on foot. That being said it is still a big game with plenty to explore and take in. The Wasteland is home to many factions, such as: RESISTANCE - A group of people who seek to destroy the Authority's power over the Wasteland.AUTHORITY- A highly organized and weaponized military force that controls and shapes the Wasteland how they see fit. Unlike the mutants and bandits that wander the Wasteland, the Authority knows what it's doing. They use personal energy shields, recharging stations that refill their energy meters, and utilize cover and tactics.BANDITSGearheads - They are the strongest, most intelligent bandit clan in the whole Wasteland, and are best at using heavy machinery and producing energy. They are heavily armored and have the second strongest Minigun soldier. Their combat preference centers around explosives and robotics, making extensive use of Sentry Bots and Turrets.Ghosts - An insane group of cannibals whose dwellings and vehicles are littered with decorative skulls and blood smears as signs of their victories in the Wasteland. They are very agile, maneuvering around the environment with ease performing jumps and other tricks to disorient enemies. They prefer close-in, hand-to-hand combat, making use of Wingsticks and bladed weapons like sickles and kitchen knives. They also sometimes use pistols and assault rifles.Jackal Clan - They're the second most powerful clan, bested only by the Gearheads in manpower. Being agile and tenacious of life, they wear minimal armor and are armed mainly with improvised hand weapons and crossbows. They also use a unique explosive called the Balloon Bomb. They howl and yip, using the the canyon walls to amplify the echos of their shouts and make intruders think that there are more of them in any one spot than there really are. They surprise and swarm their foes, rushing in groups of up to six at a time.Scorchers -  Much like the Ghosts in the way they use environment to their advantage, but they aren't cannibals. They use improvised hand weapons, including spiked baseball bats, as well as firearms and grenades. They worship the Apophis asteroid as a God and decorate themselves, their vehicles and their residences with images of fire and destruction. They're masters of ambush, hunting in packs and surprising their victims in the most unlikely places.Shrouded Clan - They are the most technologically advanced and intelligent Bandit Clan in the Northern Wasteland, and also strong enemies. They tend to use assault rifles and grenades, and use cover frequently.Wasted Clan - A group of British-accented bandits with gung-ho mentality, which means they will suicidally charge at you. They prefer hand weapons, explosives, firearms and are particularly adept at vehicular combat.9/10 Highly Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(RAGE: Wasteland Legends multiplayer mode will have a review soon!)PROS: - Amazing gunplay - Vehicle gameplay is full of control - Extra goodies, minigames, and easter eggs - Exploration is key for a good time - Side missions are so enjoyableCONS:(None of these take away from the game itself, they just get annoying) - AMD Driver issues - FOV is way too lowOVERVIEW:     RAGE is an amazing experience, one that will be remembered in my heart for a long time. I originally played through RAGE on the Xbox 360, but during that playthrough, I only went through the game in a linear fashion. For my second playthrough on the PC, I thought i'd explore the content some more. RAGE starts off with you waking up in an Ark. ""Welcome to the future!"", the game tells you as you come to realize that the future looks terrible. Turns out, an asteroid had collided with Earth, wiping out nearly every city, or at least all the cities around you. People are still around, but they are from the future, as you are considered to be from the past. RAGE emphazises popularity and community, and with all the enjoyable characters, amazing voice acting and sound design and art design, the game can grab you easily and fit you in with the world to help you understand all the struggles these people are going through. Every character is unique and equally lovable. The world is huge and fun to explore. Tons of side missions can be optionally accepted, which can also lead to new areas you would have never explored before. 4 well hidden easter eggs which are, not only rewarding, but very reminisant (Once you find them, you'll know what i'm talking about). Tons of collectable cards around the entire game which can be used to make some extra cash by playing a game of cards in town, which is actually really fun, despite how simple the game itself looks. The gunplay in RAGE is amazing. There is not a complete plethora of weapons, and I do wish there were more, but what's given to you is great in its own entirety. Upgrades can be purchased and found in side missions as rewards which is a great way to encourage these missions, because the upgrades from side missions, like the auto-sniper upgrade, are really really useful. Every single area you explore is insanely fleshed out and impressive at the same time, thanks to id Tech5, showing off amazing visuals with strong gameplay. One they you may notice about RAGE is how difficulty balances with your items. It's weird, but it works. I played through the game on Normal, which, later in the game, does get pretty difficult. Enemies become a lot tougher. This is where id's genious balancing comes into play. You have 10 bandages and you're fighting against heavily armored bandits. Yes, as you keep getting low on health, you can just hit Q to quickly heal, but as long as you keep getting shot and low on health, you'll quickly use up your bandages, meaning you have to use other things to kill your enemies quickly so they dont deplete your bandages. What goes along with great gunplay? Your choices of ammunition. This is where RAGE becomes so much more fun, trying to play with the different ammo types, seeing what each one does, ranging from Electric Darts to Dynamite Darts to Mind Control Darts, all holding their own unique ability. The mind control darts allow you to take over an enemy and guide them and blow them up, killing them and damagin enemies around them. Electric darts allow you to shock enemies, of course, but also can hit water to shock anyone touching the water. It's all basic stuff, but makes RAGE so much more enjoyable. In RAGE, there is a lot of driving and a lot of combat while driving. New cars can be unlocked in races, which are extremely fun thanks to how much control driving actually has. After winning Race Certificates, you can buy upgrades for your car such as armor or themes. Different cars have different gun limitations, such as the Anarchy Edition Rat Rod, only being able to have one type of gun at a time, while cars like the Monarch allow for all types of weapons on the car at the same time. Bandits in cars can also be killed for extra cash in both sides of the Wasteland. Overall, i'm impressed with how much content is actually in RAGE.     RAGE is a great game, amazing at best. It does very little to upset me besides the occasional FPS drops and the annoying FOV, but those don't take away from the game's atmoshpere and gameplay. I recommend RAGE to everyone. It's fun, interesting, and a game that encourages all types of play rather than a few, which is done well in every way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At 4 years old i still come back to this every year because it is a lot of fun! Looks great, sounds great. The DLC (yes only one) was also great fun.The characters and locations are memorable. The wingsticks are the best original weapons i've used in a FPS. But the other craftables are brilliant and satisfying too!Go Buy this! 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a game released in 2011, it does have quite an impressive look in terms of video quality and realism. The world design and artwork is beautiful, and really does make up for the mediocre story line. Don't get me wrong, it's still an enjoyable game with the combat, vehicles and visuals. Definately worth a play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Deeply disappointed. I had been very excited about a new game from ID. It was Doom that had dragged me into the video game world (and ruined my university days) and another game that could distract me from how much my life sucked seemed impossible to say no to. Well, except that I was broke...because my life sucked. Then I found it on sale and had to have it! And I opened it knowing I would love it. Except I didn't. The first thing I ran into was how unappealing  NPC characters were  (though Goodman wasn't TOO bad), or even outright creapy (but not in the good way, but in the ""hide your children way""). The interaction with the the NPCs is very limited and two-dimentional. Although it does have  the benifit of limiting the amount of time you have to spend with the creapy ones... There was a little eye candy (Marry me, Jani!), but not like you are getting personal time with them.The bad guys are also disappointing. I swear, one of the groups (the guys with the remote control exploding toy cars) was a perfect rip off of the bad guys from game Fear. The exact dialog and voices. I can only hope it was done ironically. The other bad guy groups are neary as bed. One group sounds the they are auditioning for the Grumpy Bears (Care Bear's mortal enemies), and one group sounds like ""bad russian stereotype"". The battle models are nice but still predictable, fine, but it is difficult to take seriously when your killing what sounds like an ogre that was eaten by a teddy bear, or that cartoon Boris character. You want to have faith in the fantasy, but you just can't.The guns are not bad, but ""select one of 4"" for a quick scroll through is stupid. Actually most of the ""self"" interface is a disaster. And where the hell is the health bar??? If you see ""red"" you are almost dead? Was that the plan?? Granted scrounging for health packs is so 1992 (when I was failing university), but it did give some purpose to all the wandering around. Hide and you heal? Right...nanites. Just don't get shot with something too big or too often. Granted, the whole thing did work for Call of Duty pretty good so maybe I shouldn't judge that one.Next, the cars are a pain is the♥♥♥♥♥to drive, and the game leans heavily on their use. Not only do you need to use them for transportation to missions across the waste lands (fair enough) and engage in combat on the way their (rip off Mad Max much, but that is alright too), but the game forces you to constantly upgrade your car by doing these frustrating off-story racing missions. The vehicle controls are so bad that instead of hours of fun, it was hours of screaming (literally) frustration. My carpal tunnel stress made my teen years look like a knitting class. In terms of game benefit, there is none; in no way does it push the story along. And the race tracks are the same space as the road warrior-ing. You could say irony, but to me it says the producers were to lazy/cheap to program more space, or to add more to the story. Driving itself is the complaint, or my skill at it; I had just finished Borderlands 2 and Far Cry 2, and there is HJGE driving in both, but those two games didn't have me on the edge of rage-quit (no pun intended) every time I got behind the wheel. The most frustrating thing was the narrow path that the levels follow. The driving sucked but the play space is extremely limited. With the current focus in gaming being giant sandbox worlds, not being able to climb a rock thats knee high, or jump a waist high railing seems kinda silly. Far Cry 2 has you wandering all over the place, looking for new angles on a problem or for monetary resources. Borderlands 2 does the same (A). The Rage developers create a rather nice (or nasty) world that you want to go look at up close, but they keep you locked on a tight path leading from A to B, and thats it. And there were some REALLY cool scenery, with the classic ID giant biomass...gunk...whatever the hell that was about. They never explained it but it was attention grabbing.And how many games can you rip off at one time? Fallout? With Arks and post-apocolyptic cities and mutants and waste land bandits and picking up trash to sell to buy bullets? And an empty bottle is worth money but no one has stripped the vending machines for parts or food preservation systems? And no one has thought to take the pre-disaster money out of it yet either? Oh, right, its a video game and internal consistancy is optional. What other games was there...Oh yeah, all that spreading alien biomass, line Doom. Well it is ID software so, why not. And Bethesda so sure, nobody to claim copyright infringement. But the lack of originality is a disappointment for the people playing. When you go ""hey, its just like Fallout"", that should be an indication that you are lacking in creativity. And the voices from Fear? This doesn't inspire...I will give the credit for the conspiracy with Apophis though. Not original, but at least its timely.In all, I would NOT recommend this game to anyone. Panic firefights, yes, but too much unnecessary frustration and mood  breaking faults. I give it a >D< for Disappointing. And I bought it on sale!I will say thanks for the Shotgun. I can never have enough shotgun...And also for Jani, Friday and Destinee...but don't tell my girlfriend.0)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is a shooter set in a post-apocalyptic future. RAGE is strictly a shooter (with no RPG mechanics like you'd find in the newer Fallouts), and its world is far less believable - more Mad Max than plausible future prediction. I must say that the story is linear and boring, but in the light of the previous sentence, criticising it would just seem petty.Let's get the good over with first. RAGE looks fantastic: the graphics and the overall design are very good indeed. Character models are great and the gestures natural-looking, although most of the characters have little to say. The shooting is better than I am used to as well, with dead enemies tumbling over obstacles and maintaining momentum instead of just slumping over or ragdollizing ridiculously. Most factions have some lore tacked onto them, and the enemies fight accordingly: some gangs prefer to take cover behind each other, others like to use explosives, while others might prefer to close in without too much organizing.That's about it for the good stuff, unfortunately. So here comes the flak:1) The weapons are poorly balanced. The assault rifle and machine gun are particularly useless against regular enemies, and I noticed almost exclusively favouring the shotgun and wingstick (bladed boomerang). Most weapons have different ammunition to choose from; this can transform the regular pistol into a powerful magnum, the shotgun into a grenade launcher, the crossbow into a kind of long-distance taser. While this makes otherwise poor weapons at least feasible, it also moves the good ones further ahead of the game.2) The world is tiny. It attempts to give an impression of a biggish sandbox, but there are only two hub towns and there's fairly little to do outside of missions (which are few as well). Exploration is basically useless. If you're here for a Fallout 3/New Vegas experience, forget it.3) Remember those great graphics I mentioned? Well guess what, there is a problem: texture pop-in is a major issue without unofficial fixes (which are easy to find on the Internet, thank Christ). Even with powerful hardware, you can turn 180 degrees and have to wait a second or two to wait for the textures to load, then turn back and have to wait for the game to load the same textures you were looking at not five seconds earlier.4) There are maybe two boss fights, both of them boring, and neither of them at the end of the game, so the rocket launcher and BFG are pretty much useless unless you go for some über-difficult playthrough. Makes me wonder why they bothered with said weapons in the first place.5) You may have guessed this already, but the ending is crap. You just throw wingsticks for fifteen minutes and get confetti dropped on you with a ""you win"" cutscene on the background (metaphorically, of course). There is no build-up to a grand end, the game just sort of stops short and goes ""fine, you've won.""Probably the most mediocre game that I have ever played, if that makes any sense.

												It feels like this game just doesn't try to entertain you and bring something new or exciting. The gameplay is pretty linear and so is the story. Stupid limitations from the start like not being able to pickup the gun from the fallen enemy until the friendly NPC gives you an exact same weapon ruins any hope for experience you would expect from a game based around large post apocalyptic world. The environmental art is great and sometimes is truly wonderful but it's not helped by the story and characters, so it doesn't work. I know I haven't play much of it, but I had enough and I don't really want to continue. It's a high budget mediocre game, if you're not easily impressed by yet another FPS game, just stay away from it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion, Rage isn't so bad, for the price at least ($4.99 Discount) ($9.99 Original price). The game suffers greatly from pop-ins, boring story, and stiff gameplay. For some reason lowering the graphic settings seems to help simmer down the pop in issues for me. The FPS combat aspect is fun but still lacking. The enemies' movements are pretty cool, but you as the player, your movements are very poor in comparison.If the player had the abilities to evade and maneuver more like or similar to the enemies it would be a great asset to the gameplay. I haven't gotten far into the story, but I can tell you now it isn't something great. While the beginning shows something unique it quickly starts to fall bland and boneless. So far it has been missions such as:""Go to this person and get something.""OH, that person's something has been stolen. ""Go to a Raider's camp and retrieve it.""There is no actual Open world, everything is oddly convenient. Also, you can't pick up enemy weapons and gear. The game is very, very, basic. Which is unfortunate, it had potential. Rage has a Mad Max feel to it, you can race with your buggy and combat enemies with mounted weapons, but sadly the world just isn't open enough to justify it. This game is simply nothing exciting, but truth is I'm enjoying the game for what it costs. I would say give the game a try if it's on discount. I wouldn't recommend paying $10 as for this game honestly doesn't feel like a $10 game.Final Rating: 6/10 Could've been much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like it so far. Car combat is very boring compared to borderlands. However the guns are fun to use. The graphics look good. Not all the stuff in game looks good. Some stuff does look blurry close up. Phones for an example. However overall it looks good for its age. My main complaint is the dumb save system. Grrrrr. Your forced to save every 10 to 20 minutes unless you like starting over from the start of a mission. Ugh. If your looking for a good first person shooter then this is a solid choice.Ok just finished the game. Took me 12 hours for just the main game. I own the DLC so I am starting on that part next. You get a nail gun. The ending for the main game is lame like everyone says. But until then its mostly good fun. I still hate the races. Ugh.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is a game that fails to live up to any of its potential. If you go in expecting Fallout you will be sorely disappointed, since it's a linear shooter with (bad) vehicle sequences in a hub world. The weapon variety is excellent, but there's really no reason to use much more than the handgun. Enemies take twice as long to kill as they should, and their AI isn't nearly good enough to make an extended firefight against 3 guys interesting. There's no real challenge, since if you know how to circle strafe you can beat most enemies with just your fists. The story is as forgettable as it gets, and the ending is the biggest anticlimax I've ever experienced in the game. The biggest offense this game commits is that it is dreadfully boring. I had to force myself to actually finish it, as all of the combat was boring as hell, the level design is muddy brown and blurry thanks to an obnoxious film grain effect that can't be turned off. Don't buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 21, 2014
												Where to begin… So as stated on the box art: RAGE, from the creators of doom and quake. This would seem promising considering this game comes from the creators of two of the best series of all time, but does it really? The answer is no… RAGE falls way short of even being somewhat decent. Here are the reasons I found RAGE to be a complete disappointment and the only rage that came from this experience is the rage that I now have towards id software. Shame because id software was my favorite developer.And just a fyi, my pc is perfectly compatible to play anything you throw at it, Tomb Raider, Bioshock Infinite, Dishonored, Shadow Warrior (2013) and Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 all work on the highest settings without a problem.First of all, the graphics… I’m sure we all have heard the nightmare about the graphics being terrible, but let me be more specific. Long story short, the game wasn’t programmed correctly. For example, when I look at something, it will take a few seconds before the textures load in, then I’ll look somewhere else and those textures do the same thing, then I look back at the first place and those textures have to load BACK in. Please explain the logic in this game, the textures are not supposed to vanish when you look away, they’re supposed to stay there until you are far away or have loaded another map. Aside from this, the textures are a very low quality/low resolution. So even after the textures are loaded 5 seconds after you look at them, they still look ugly anyway. I have seen various solutions to fix all of this, and none of them have worked; although the game should be programmed correctly so you don’t even have to waste your time on this. Is it really too much to ask for? All we want is a game that we can load up and be ready to play, we don’t want to spent 2 hours trying various solutions just to get the stupid game to work. Then to top all this off, considering there so many problems with textures popping in, we are also given the worst problem of all… lag. As I said before, my pc has more than enough power to run this game. I can play Bioshock Infinite and Tomb Raider on the highest settings with no problem, but I can’t play RAGE (a game that’s 2 years older) on even the lowest settings. So good job id software, I’m sure you’re very proud of yourselves; you successfully created a game that is nearly unplayable. So aside from the game looking like something you found in the back of the refrigerator from 3 months ago, and the game running like a truck with cement tires…. that are shaped like squares, maybe the actually game play will be fun?…… Who am I kidding, they can’t even get the game to run properly, why on earth would the actual game be fun? I will admit, the first 2 hours were certainly fun, brought back memories of the classic id software games, just with horrible graphics. But then after the 2 hours of the fun shooting/exploring/collecting, it decides to take a rather stupid turn in events. First of all, the entire aspect of driving just literally killed the game. I didn’t come here to drive a buggy that explodes every 5 min and am forced to upgrade and waste all the money I just spent 4 hours collecting. If id software wanted to make a driving game, then they should of made a driving game. There is a reason we have different genre’s of games, not so that we can take each genre and awkwardly merge them together that does nothing but fills you with rage *cough cough* So aside from the stupid driving/vehicle upgrade monstrosity, ok lets go shoot things! “NO TO HELL WITH THAT” says id software, “HOW ABOUT YOU GO DELIVER MAIL INSDEAD!” yes this is correct, after 3 hours, the shooting completely stops and you find yourself delivering mail and doing other completely stupid/boring/uneventful tasks. After many hours I had absolutely no use for my weapons and the game didn’t even let me carry them (I guess they disappeared to Narnia) Long story short; the game play sucks, it’s probably better to just replay the first 2 hours a few times then go buy another game.So what’s left? Oh, yes, the story….. *falls on the ground laughing* yea there’s absolutely no reason to even talk about that.So taking everything into consideration, we have a game that wasn’t programmed correctly, stupid graphics, stupid game play, horrible merging of two completely different genre’s and little to no story. 1/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game had the potential to be alot more than what it delivers to the player. The wasteland looks beautiful & very highly detailed. However, up close the textures look hideous, probably a compromise they had to make to accomodate the limited memory available on the consoles. Despite its many shortcomings, the game had potential, its too bad they didn't expand it much further with variable side quests (most of them are merely repeats of the same map in reverse).Its sad to see ID failing to deliver what they did so marvelously on their past releases. Quake, Doom & Wolfenstein were some of the finest shooters of their time. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The FPS from Father of FPS...RAGE provides us the combination of original FPS, racing, and engineer system in semi-open world. RAGE has great gameplay. Pretty solid gunplay and various items. AI Enemies are bit challenge, but it's still easy even you play on nightmare mode. (I can fist all mutants without dying)  RAGE also has great design in Wasteland..both terrain and each city. NPCs look natural and thanks to animations. which they help to express story beyond Wasteland..and fun racing.However, I mention on ID tech 5 engine as developers try to introduce. It looks great from distance and NPCs, but most of them suffer from low textures becuase of multi-platforms. From the beginning till the end, I feel very fun shooting at bandits and mutants, but RAGE doesn't have cilmax gunplay, becuase of too much ammunition and just 5-6 enemy per groups. Lack of challenged boss fight and unlike DOOM 3, most of maps are blocked by invisible walls which it's really non-sense in free-roam concept.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personal Rating: 6 of 10Good graphics but linear and repetative gameplay and story. There are almost zero customization in the game except for fixed weapons and vehicles upgrades and ammo types. Do take note that this is a ported game from console and its really buggy with choppy graphics specially when running on ATI graphics card. There are some alternatives out there but it won't resolve the issue completely. If you are looking for the Anarchy Edition, try third party legitimate website for the DLC pack.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is a game that does a lot right but has enough frustrating elements to keep it from truly achieving greatness.  The weapons are satisfying, enemy encounters are fun, and the presentation is great but it's wrapped around a terrible semi-open world progression and bland car combat.  I would have preferred Rage if it was just a linear corridor shooter because the combat is so much more enjoyable than all the vehicle and hubworld exploration segments.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Right, I wanted to write the review a while back, but just kinda forgot about it... So here's my list of pros, cons and miscPros:-Good looking game-Good gameplay mechanics-Suprisingly good driving(Was expecting it to be messy to be brutally honest)-Decent soundtrackCons:-Forgettable characters-Forgettable Senario-Pleanty of useless weaponry(I only used three weapons out of the lot)-Errand boy syndromeMisc:-Mad Max and other post apoc refferences are there-Shows that is was a game made by heavy hetal loversI recommend this game for anyone who likes a decent shooter that goes out of the COD mold and it is quite fun to play, even though the senario is really... Inexistant... But still, Mutie Bash and stuff like that keep it quite fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An ideal game for someone like me. Non linear in most places, linear in some, story driven, GREAT characters, even greater animations, solid gameplay + good focus on combat.The game is immense. It really plays as good as it looks and that's rare in most games. The levels are vast and detailed and the weapons and gadgets are loads of fun to upgrade and play around with. There's a good mix of linear and non linear gameplay which means that there's an equal amount of attention to the story and the rpg aspect (rpg's usually have a not so deep story).Although it's post apocalyptic, it's seriously original and the detailed environments and genuine atmosphere prove this. I cannnot believe only 7 people on my friends list have this game! :D9/10 (because no game can be completely perfect ^_^)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is an awesome FPS, it has stunning graphics, fast mechanics but it isn't too easy though.Every weapon feels great, you ""feel"" every bullet you shoot. The enemies are cool, each of them has a great design.I can't say that the story is great, but you don't focus on that when your objective is to shoot everything you see, am I right? ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Short: An unsuccessful blend of genresThe Long:With a setting very much like Fallout 3, RAGE instead focuses on being a straight 3D Shooter (not surprisingly given that it’s an id-game) and throws in some fancy driving/racing for good measure. But all these elements never quite gel. The driving feels very much like an afterthought to amp up the game (or an attempt to channel Mad Max 2) but not only does this feel like a separate game within the game (which the racing basically is) but it very much sabotages any kind of open world feeling games like Fallout 3 offer, since you don’t explore the world, you simply drive through it … fast!Also the pacing of the campaign is terrible. It’s basically the concept of a linear shooter disguised as a RPG quest system. The player is rushed from one mission to the next. There are few side quests, mostly lazily designed by revisiting a previous location playing it backwards from end to start the second time. RPG elements are rudimentary and never quite pay off.Characters are superficial and you never get emotionally invested in their stories or fates. But at least the voice acting is fairly good.The storyline is badly constructed. Starting from the initial point from the player being rescued by Hagar just to be send out again to do missions, over establishing the faceless Authority (which way too  much looked like Half-Life 2’s Combine troops) as villains before even properly explaining what makes them villainous, to shoving the player towards joining a Resistance he knows little about. As in fact the whole background of this world is never properly established.On the bright side the game looks very good and plays quite well as a shooter. The locations are well designed, with a decent amount of attention to detail.In my opinion the game would have been better had it focused on being a 3D Shooter. Driving could still have been part of the game, but in a way harmonious to the gameplay (e.g. like Far Cry 2 - as mediocre as that game was).The way it is RAGE pretends to be more than it is and fails on living up to that pretense. It’s not a bad game, but playing it leaves one disappointed because it promised more than it delivered. The ending is also fairly unsatisfactory, but I assume the developers pretty much envisioned it with some ""RAGE 2"" in mind. In a better game it would have disappointed me. Here I really didn't care.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage was a rather enjoyable experience for me. It was somewhat similar to the Borderlands experience however I did find it quite difficult to get into at the beginning. The story, if you could call it that is difficult to follow as you're thrown into the deep end, and then you're asked to do a bunch or errands. Hang in and eventually it'll pay off. I would recommend Rage but only if discounted and I would recommend you buy the DLC's up front if discounted. It's a solid 7.5/10 from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm tossed on this game. Everything about me wants to love this new shooter from the gods that damn near invented the fps genre. However, it appears IDs design team thought it would be best to stick with game play from the 1990's. Rage looks great, no doubt. The enviroments look amazing for a post apocalyptic game. Combat is fierce and all the weapons sound and feel great. So whats wrong you ask? Everything else! ID isnt know for storytelling, but after 10+ years of creating games, you would think their narrative abilities would have improved over the years. It feels like they just made a moderate sized world full of things to gib and tacked on some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story a 5th grader wrote. Vehicles feel more like a afterthought. The fact that its you main mode of transportation really hurts too. In a nutshell, if you like mindless, boring shooting elements with a halfed♥♥♥♥♥crafting system and a lame♥♥♥♥♥travel system. Then you will like this over priced, over rated, over hyped release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To put it bluntly Rage is dumb.I sorta got behind the idea of Rage, being a post apocalyptic Mad-Max style game. The only problem is that Borderlands and Fallout 3 did it first. Indeed while playing Rage it feels just like playing Borderlands without cel shaded graphics and the humor.The lack of humor is what startled me with Rage. All the character are stock action movie grizzled veterans, the plot is extremely generic, almost everything about it is treated like the characters are incapable of laughing at their ridiculous situation. There are good things about it, I mean the gunplay is alright and the maps are spectacularly detailed. But all the maps are tediously linear and while there are reasons to backtrack through them, you wouldn't want to. That's not even mentioning the technical problems with the game's engine, many of which still exist and have yet to be patched outI question why this game was made and why Id would stoop so low to just make a more generic Borderlands with Call of Duty elements. One that feels like nobody put any time or attention into detail and just surgically inserted elements because they thought it would sell better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A disappointing clone of Borderlands, Rage really has nothing to recommend it at all. It smacks terribly of a brilliantly designed engine in desperate need of a game to make the most of it. It completely lacks artistic flair, unlike Borderlands, which has oodles. The game just doesn't have any character at all. Did you ever watch the series Tru Calling? Well the game-play strongly reminds me of that series. You would have to watch the series to know why. And if I sound harsh, well, yes I am, but I expected much better from the company that pretty much invented the FPS game genre.Recommended? No, I am afraid not. I guess when it's in the sales, then OK, but in the mean time buy Borderlands instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hey! Now that my PC can actually play this game (not that it couldn't have on it's release) I can write a review! It's a linear world almost presenting itself as open world. The performance issues of the past seem to not exist anymore. Texture pop-in can be annoying if you're looking around too quickly. The story and characters are amusing and it's a shame the game wasn't developed further to make use of them. Oh well!!RAGE is a good, fun, and relatively easy game to play in my opinion. It provides a casual FPS wasteland story and experience. Plenty of racing and fighting to be had.Not that anyone cares anymore, but I'd recommend it with a  7/10... A worthwhile game. Graphics are pretty good too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lackluster and anticlimatic are about the right words that can be used to sum up this game.The combat is decent. It's nothing awe inspiring, but it holds its own. The AI seems a little smarter than the norm, as it will allow squads of enemies to work as teams to advance, retreat, or attempt to outflank the player. It has its holes that can be exploited and sometimes does some dumb things, but for the most part provided for satisfying combat.Car combat can be a little frustrating due to clunky controls. It also seems to serve no point other than a novelty or to disguise the game world to seem more open and exansive. It is mostly a boring affair that wouldn't have been missed if it was not in the game.There is an illusion of an open world, but the game areas are actually quite linear. There are many side missions that seem pointless and unrewarding. It probably didn't help that rewards were mysterious and the game is not very forthcoming in communicating what they were. They also tell little about the world you are in. Very thin and bland and could easily be avoided, in favor of sticking with the main mission, without much loss to the experience whatsoever. The game world itself felt rather shallow and it was difficult to relate to or care about anyone or anything within it.Lastly, and probably my biggest gripe, the game just seems to abruptly end in a very anticlimatic fashion. There really wasn't any real main antigonist in the game. You hear rumors and details of the promise of some kind of rival that the player may have to face, but none of it ever comes to fruition. There is never even a single encounter, dialogue, or anything with a supposed main antagonist. The ending of the game lacks any kind of boss encounter at all, even though it leads the player to believe that one should be expected. It's as if the developers ran out of time and resources to flesh out anything the game teases the player with and just abruptly ends. Very lackluster and disappointing, nearly feeling like a waste of time.Only get it if you have a serious hankering for a single player FPS and you've played everything better already. Only get it on sale as well. Or better yet, save your time and play something better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The driving as boring and and story very linear and boring but the combat was great.The subquests were mostly ""point B to point B"" kinds of quests do something for this guy and he'll doi something for you. Get object from here and give to guy. Go to dungeon kill enemys. Etc. The story is simple. Emerge from vault/ark/bunker thing and help people. After helping people take down the government that you know nothing about. Are they good? are they bad? We dont know. Were told by some rebelian members that their bad and being the amazingly intelligent survivors we are we blindly follow this man to the end. And when the end comes. We get basically nothing.My awnser for this game is yes and no. Replayablity level is 0 but run and gun shooter level is 6 or 7			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lackluster and anticlimatic are about the right words that can be used to sum up this game.The combat is decent. It's nothing awe inspiring, but it holds its own. The AI seems a little smarter than the norm, as it will allow squads of enemies to work as teams to advance, retreat, or attempt to outflank the player. It has its holes that can be exploited and sometimes does some dumb things, but for the most part provided for satisfying combat.Car combat can be a little frustrating due to clunky controls. It also seems to serve no point other than a novelty or to disguise the game world to seem more open and exansive. It is mostly a boring affair that wouldn't have been missed if it was not in the game.There is an illusion of an open world, but the game areas are actually quite linear. There are many side missions that seem pointless and unrewarding. It probably didn't help that rewards were mysterious and the game is not very forthcoming in communicating what they were. They also tell little about the world you are in. Very thin and bland and could easily be avoided, in favor of sticking with the main mission, without much loss to the experience whatsoever. The game world itself felt rather shallow and it was difficult to relate to or care about anyone or anything within it.Lastly, and probably my biggest gripe, the game just seems to abruptly end in a very anticlimatic fashion. There really wasn't any real main antigonist in the game. You hear rumors and details of the promise of some kind of rival that the player may have to face, but none of it ever comes to fruition. There is never even a single encounter, dialogue, or anything with a supposed main antagonist. The ending of the game lacks any kind of boss encounter at all, even though it leads the player to believe that one should be expected. It's as if the developers ran out of time and resources to flesh out anything the game teases the player with and just abruptly ends. Very lackluster and disappointing, nearly feeling like a waste of time.Only get it if you have a serious hankering for a single player FPS and you've played everything better already. Only get it on sale as well. Or better yet, save your time and play something better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It feels like this game just doesn't try to entertain you and bring something new or exciting. The gameplay is pretty linear and so is the story. Stupid limitations from the start like not being able to pickup the gun from the fallen enemy until the friendly NPC gives you an exact same weapon ruins any hope for experience you would expect from a game based around large post apocalyptic world. The environmental art is great and sometimes is truly wonderful but it's not helped by the story and characters, so it doesn't work. I know I haven't play much of it, but I had enough and I don't really want to continue. It's a high budget mediocre game, if you're not easily impressed by yet another FPS game, just stay away from it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm tossed on this game. Everything about me wants to love this new shooter from the gods that damn near invented the fps genre. However, it appears IDs design team thought it would be best to stick with game play from the 1990's. Rage looks great, no doubt. The enviroments look amazing for a post apocalyptic game. Combat is fierce and all the weapons sound and feel great. So whats wrong you ask? Everything else! ID isnt know for storytelling, but after 10+ years of creating games, you would think their narrative abilities would have improved over the years. It feels like they just made a moderate sized world full of things to gib and tacked on some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story a 5th grader wrote. Vehicles feel more like a afterthought. The fact that its you main mode of transportation really hurts too. In a nutshell, if you like mindless, boring shooting elements with a halfed♥♥♥♥♥crafting system and a lame♥♥♥♥♥travel system. Then you will like this over priced, over rated, over hyped release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To put it bluntly Rage is dumb.I sorta got behind the idea of Rage, being a post apocalyptic Mad-Max style game. The only problem is that Borderlands and Fallout 3 did it first. Indeed while playing Rage it feels just like playing Borderlands without cel shaded graphics and the humor.The lack of humor is what startled me with Rage. All the character are stock action movie grizzled veterans, the plot is extremely generic, almost everything about it is treated like the characters are incapable of laughing at their ridiculous situation. There are good things about it, I mean the gunplay is alright and the maps are spectacularly detailed. But all the maps are tediously linear and while there are reasons to backtrack through them, you wouldn't want to. That's not even mentioning the technical problems with the game's engine, many of which still exist and have yet to be patched outI question why this game was made and why Id would stoop so low to just make a more generic Borderlands with Call of Duty elements. One that feels like nobody put any time or attention into detail and just surgically inserted elements because they thought it would sell better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Short: An unsuccessful blend of genresThe Long:With a setting very much like Fallout 3, RAGE instead focuses on being a straight 3D Shooter (not surprisingly given that it’s an id-game) and throws in some fancy driving/racing for good measure. But all these elements never quite gel. The driving feels very much like an afterthought to amp up the game (or an attempt to channel Mad Max 2) but not only does this feel like a separate game within the game (which the racing basically is) but it very much sabotages any kind of open world feeling games like Fallout 3 offer, since you don’t explore the world, you simply drive through it … fast!Also the pacing of the campaign is terrible. It’s basically the concept of a linear shooter disguised as a RPG quest system. The player is rushed from one mission to the next. There are few side quests, mostly lazily designed by revisiting a previous location playing it backwards from end to start the second time. RPG elements are rudimentary and never quite pay off.Characters are superficial and you never get emotionally invested in their stories or fates. But at least the voice acting is fairly good.The storyline is badly constructed. Starting from the initial point from the player being rescued by Hagar just to be send out again to do missions, over establishing the faceless Authority (which way too  much looked like Half-Life 2’s Combine troops) as villains before even properly explaining what makes them villainous, to shoving the player towards joining a Resistance he knows little about. As in fact the whole background of this world is never properly established.On the bright side the game looks very good and plays quite well as a shooter. The locations are well designed, with a decent amount of attention to detail.In my opinion the game would have been better had it focused on being a 3D Shooter. Driving could still have been part of the game, but in a way harmonious to the gameplay (e.g. like Far Cry 2 - as mediocre as that game was).The way it is RAGE pretends to be more than it is and fails on living up to that pretense. It’s not a bad game, but playing it leaves one disappointed because it promised more than it delivered. The ending is also fairly unsatisfactory, but I assume the developers pretty much envisioned it with some ""RAGE 2"" in mind. In a better game it would have disappointed me. Here I really didn't care.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A disappointing clone of Borderlands, Rage really has nothing to recommend it at all. It smacks terribly of a brilliantly designed engine in desperate need of a game to make the most of it. It completely lacks artistic flair, unlike Borderlands, which has oodles. The game just doesn't have any character at all. Did you ever watch the series Tru Calling? Well the game-play strongly reminds me of that series. You would have to watch the series to know why. And if I sound harsh, well, yes I am, but I expected much better from the company that pretty much invented the FPS game genre.Recommended? No, I am afraid not. I guess when it's in the sales, then OK, but in the mean time buy Borderlands instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 21, 2014
												Where to begin… So as stated on the box art: RAGE, from the creators of doom and quake. This would seem promising considering this game comes from the creators of two of the best series of all time, but does it really? The answer is no… RAGE falls way short of even being somewhat decent. Here are the reasons I found RAGE to be a complete disappointment and the only rage that came from this experience is the rage that I now have towards id software. Shame because id software was my favorite developer.And just a fyi, my pc is perfectly compatible to play anything you throw at it, Tomb Raider, Bioshock Infinite, Dishonored, Shadow Warrior (2013) and Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 all work on the highest settings without a problem.First of all, the graphics… I’m sure we all have heard the nightmare about the graphics being terrible, but let me be more specific. Long story short, the game wasn’t programmed correctly. For example, when I look at something, it will take a few seconds before the textures load in, then I’ll look somewhere else and those textures do the same thing, then I look back at the first place and those textures have to load BACK in. Please explain the logic in this game, the textures are not supposed to vanish when you look away, they’re supposed to stay there until you are far away or have loaded another map. Aside from this, the textures are a very low quality/low resolution. So even after the textures are loaded 5 seconds after you look at them, they still look ugly anyway. I have seen various solutions to fix all of this, and none of them have worked; although the game should be programmed correctly so you don’t even have to waste your time on this. Is it really too much to ask for? All we want is a game that we can load up and be ready to play, we don’t want to spent 2 hours trying various solutions just to get the stupid game to work. Then to top all this off, considering there so many problems with textures popping in, we are also given the worst problem of all… lag. As I said before, my pc has more than enough power to run this game. I can play Bioshock Infinite and Tomb Raider on the highest settings with no problem, but I can’t play RAGE (a game that’s 2 years older) on even the lowest settings. So good job id software, I’m sure you’re very proud of yourselves; you successfully created a game that is nearly unplayable. So aside from the game looking like something you found in the back of the refrigerator from 3 months ago, and the game running like a truck with cement tires…. that are shaped like squares, maybe the actually game play will be fun?…… Who am I kidding, they can’t even get the game to run properly, why on earth would the actual game be fun? I will admit, the first 2 hours were certainly fun, brought back memories of the classic id software games, just with horrible graphics. But then after the 2 hours of the fun shooting/exploring/collecting, it decides to take a rather stupid turn in events. First of all, the entire aspect of driving just literally killed the game. I didn’t come here to drive a buggy that explodes every 5 min and am forced to upgrade and waste all the money I just spent 4 hours collecting. If id software wanted to make a driving game, then they should of made a driving game. There is a reason we have different genre’s of games, not so that we can take each genre and awkwardly merge them together that does nothing but fills you with rage *cough cough* So aside from the stupid driving/vehicle upgrade monstrosity, ok lets go shoot things! “NO TO HELL WITH THAT” says id software, “HOW ABOUT YOU GO DELIVER MAIL INSDEAD!” yes this is correct, after 3 hours, the shooting completely stops and you find yourself delivering mail and doing other completely stupid/boring/uneventful tasks. After many hours I had absolutely no use for my weapons and the game didn’t even let me carry them (I guess they disappeared to Narnia) Long story short; the game play sucks, it’s probably better to just replay the first 2 hours a few times then go buy another game.So what’s left? Oh, yes, the story….. *falls on the ground laughing* yea there’s absolutely no reason to even talk about that.So taking everything into consideration, we have a game that wasn’t programmed correctly, stupid graphics, stupid game play, horrible merging of two completely different genre’s and little to no story. 1/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know what gets under my skin, no one seems to know what this game is, or more specifically how good it is. In case you were wondering this game is AMAZING and doesn't deserve the ghostly existence it has, even after all of this time. Let me go over a list of the pros and cons.PROS- Variety of gameplay (with tons of weapons and custimizations there is a variety of ways to take out your target (ex. the crossbow can allow one hit kills from a distance like a sniper rifle, can mind control an enemy so that he suicide bombs the other enemies behind cover, and can EXPLODE to do extra damage to enemies with heavy armor and such. However this is if you have the ammo for it))- Brightly colored cast of characters (and trust me there are ALOT)- Bullet realism ( every shot counts and you can tell when you land a hit)- Overall enjoyment and entertainment (and really whats better than that)CONS- There isn't a solid storyline and it can get confusing at time to time- The game is designed for consoles and you can tell especially when it comes to switching weapons which can be a major pain at times- Some aspects with the graphics (random trees and some other objects just spawn in with the ugliest sprites at times.)The cons aren't THAT big of an issue and using a controller is almost a necessity when dealing with the switching weapons which can be a bit crippling when your switching ammo types to match the enemy your facing and the mouse just takes too long to find and drag and etc. But I digress. This game is a most have for those who seek a bit of a challenge (and I don't mean with the pc controls) with a brightly colored cast and a variety of ways to play. Ignore what anyone has told you, this game is GOOD.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another fantastic game from id with awkward graphics. The main campaign will take you about 10 hours between two hub cities filled with side activities to do, like playing a CCG, ""wanted board"" quests, gambling, and car racing. In fact about half of the game takes place in your vehicle of choice; whether you are traveling to the next mission objective, farming upgrade tickets, or just hunting for sewer entrances (hidden DLC missions that comes free), there is a lot of non-FPS stuff to do. The main problems with this game are engine issues. There is a lot of texture popup without .cfg tweaks and a lot of the environmental objects (tables, radios, books, etc.) look like they have a single texture on them. It's a bit jarring when characters have real fluid, complex animations and top-notch texture and model work but they are surrounded by untextured objects. If you can deal with the uneven graphics, this is a real solid (albeit too easy) game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The FPS from Father of FPS...RAGE provides us the combination of original FPS, racing, and engineer system in semi-open world. RAGE has great gameplay. Pretty solid gunplay and various items. AI Enemies are bit challenge, but it's still easy even you play on nightmare mode. (I can fist all mutants without dying)  RAGE also has great design in Wasteland..both terrain and each city. NPCs look natural and thanks to animations. which they help to express story beyond Wasteland..and fun racing.However, I mention on ID tech 5 engine as developers try to introduce. It looks great from distance and NPCs, but most of them suffer from low textures becuase of multi-platforms. From the beginning till the end, I feel very fun shooting at bandits and mutants, but RAGE doesn't have cilmax gunplay, becuase of too much ammunition and just 5-6 enemy per groups. Lack of challenged boss fight and unlike DOOM 3, most of maps are blocked by invisible walls which it's really non-sense in free-roam concept.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The driving element adds a twist and vehicle combat plays well enough.  for a 2011 game the character graphics are extremely impressive and attractive. The wasteland is, as to be expected i suppose, a bit drab and not all the much fun to look at.  but whaddaya want?  its a wasteland.  if you like games like wasteland, fallout, or borderlands you will feel right at home here with RAGE.

												I really beautiful and well made game. However, singleplayer is rather short with underwhelming multiplayer. It seems like this was a Bethesda side project rushed to the big time before the story became really good. That being said, for a 15-20 hour single-player with good FPS elements, I would not pass on it when it goes on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR:In all honesty, the game is perfectly competent in what it does. In terms of presentation, it was consistently at 60 frames a second with only a few performance issues. It’s just a game that comes across as boring and heartless. It felt like there were a series of extra check boxes that were added to their list of necessities in development to try and appease various niches when they should have focused on making a good/creative shooter without all these flat bells and whistles that take away from the core experience. As a result, instead of standing out from the crowd Rage manages to look more bland than its competitors.For the full review, go here: http://dagondogs.com/2015/02/17/rage-review/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While playing the first few hours you may think it's primitive and generic but when the second part of the game with its comic and  caricature NPCs starts, you can forgive all to this game. It doesn't prevent you from having fun: a lot of ammo and buffs are provided.Developers were trying to make the world more vivid and alive but i can't say they succeeded. Still it's FPS not a RPG.Anyway, everything about this game was written in other reviews, that's just my two cents.P.S. How the hell can you set up a rally on the most dangerous territory in the middle of the game, before you capture it? This is ridiculous.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hey! Now that my PC can actually play this game (not that it couldn't have on it's release) I can write a review! It's a linear world almost presenting itself as open world. The performance issues of the past seem to not exist anymore. Texture pop-in can be annoying if you're looking around too quickly. The story and characters are amusing and it's a shame the game wasn't developed further to make use of them. Oh well!!RAGE is a good, fun, and relatively easy game to play in my opinion. It provides a casual FPS wasteland story and experience. Plenty of racing and fighting to be had.Not that anyone cares anymore, but I'd recommend it with a  7/10... A worthwhile game. Graphics are pretty good too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While the game might be shorter than others, you'll guaranteedly enjoy every second of it. Reasons why you should buy this game:1. There are several different guns and various ammo types for each of them2. Driving in the game is very fluent with its physics and control3. Very fair and balanced with its gameplay4. It has a multiplayer gamemode5. Higher difficulties can really enrich the game*I've played this game more offline so my hours on my profile are less than they actually are.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An underrated and unique shooter where excellent gameplay and enemy AI make up for a weak story and ending. Lots of weapons to choose from with different ammo types. Environments can get repetitive. The Scorchers DLC allows you to play after the conclusion of the story. Recommended at full price for post-apocalyptic fans, or at a discount for those on the fence.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Surely being a fan of ID Software, I had to try out their new game RAGE.Thinking it could be as fun as Doom or Quake, but I was wrong, this wasn't a game for me.There's nothing to complain about the graphics, using the ""MEGA TEXTURE"" technology it sure looks prettyBut I didn't like the gameplay, and I didn't like the ""Mad Max"" setting with the combined FPS and driving.Last time playing RAGE was back in 2012, and I thought that maybe I should give it another chance, but about half an hour in, I recognized it hadn't changed for me, so I gave up and quit.Now, writing this I've played the new Doom (2016) and that's more like it, much more up my street.If you are like me, prefering the old Doom and Quake, I will not recommend RAGEbut if you like the ""Mad Max"" style combined with FPS elements....you should give it a go.

												Seriously... BORING UNEVENTFUL STORY.I actively wished the entire game to have a CHOICE in ANYTHING, especially being able to side with the so-called 'authority' because they got cool armor and seemed to have some sembelance of an idea what the hell they were doing.I do not recommend this game for someone who wants:1) A good storyline with a thorough ending.2) Interesting characters you can interact with3) An open worldAdditionally, if you DO NOT want the following; beware:1) Racing is REQUIRED in the main storyline. (I do okay in racing games and was able to complete them, but I do not like them)2) a couple mini bosses but no real skill requirement to fight anything3) Endless random vendor trash to sell for no apparent reason.4) Endless ammo if you so choose.5) Enemies which while having some intelligence, still seem to put their back to you when you throw a grenade at them. (seriously, just watched 2 people run around cover and turn to face the grenade with me looking at them... smart.)6) A lack of 'fun guns' to play with. Ultimately, I ended up using the shotgun almost the entire game because using 'Pop Rockets' (grenade ammo) is simply the only weapon I found enjoyable, side for shooting mutants with an assault rifle and then slamming them in the face with melee. (other than this, wingsticks were my only other weapon choice)-Some BACKGROUND:I played RAGE originally back in 2012 and after getting bored with it, I stopped playing. This was after about 2 hours of the game and I had not completed the game.Then, again in 2014 I picked up the game again (figuratively) and played past the part I stopped at previously. Again, I became bored out of my mind and uninstalled it.Finally, in 2016 I finished it.Yes, I was bored with an id game. Three times now. I only beat the game to prove I could and... dear god it was still a waste of my time. (Surprisingly, yes I always enjoyed Doom 1,2 and 3, also played the original wolfenstein games and commander keen. So, I love id and I think they have a great staff.)Sadly, this game has dissappointed me greatly. When I first picked it up, read the cover and thought back to the trailers; I said ""My, this would rock if it's anything like what is described."" That is simply not the case.I was hopeful of a Fallout3/NewVegas with a doom atmosphere, because out of everything I want a survival horror wasteland game if I can get one. (Even if doom is a bit shooty ;-)Regardless, this game at first tries to fool you. It gives you quests, loot drops, corpses to desecrate and thereby steal gear from; but ultimately none of it matters. On top of all this; characters all spew dialog for long enough to make me decide to step away from my desk to grab a snack while they yammer, before I can actually get a quest or shop from them.If you want to jump into a shooter and just blow people and mutants up, it can be fun. I won't deny that. But ultimately, I have stopped playing it two other times because some areas are just so unbelievably boring.A final thought, the higher you crank the difficulty the higher enemy HP is. (very annoying as that is the only noticable difference)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not entirely sure how it is that I have this game on Steam but I played this game on the Playstation and I love this game. I enjoyed getting all the achievements and playing the story. There were a few points where it got slightly repetitive but the second I got tired of it was the second it changed and just became fun again. I am not sure if there is anything different to the PC version but if not enjoy yourself a nice action packed game. This game is perfect for players of all kinds. Not just the hardcore gamers but also the casual gamers or those who have never played this genre of game before. Easy but not boring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The artistic direction for this game is phenomenal. Everything from the way the weapons feel, to the lighting and town layouts, straight through to the enemies' costumes and level design really set this title apart from most any other game I've ever played. Gameplay is very very similar to Red Faction Guerilla, but better (also in first person except for the vehicle bits). If you enjoy a game that blends modern shooters (regenerating health) with RPG elements (you can construct items that buff you, or act as sentry turrets or companion robots) and old school gunning (but with great enemy AI that actually uses cover and tactics) then this game is for you. TLDR: Post-Apocalyptic FPS goodness. Buy this game, you won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite shooters. I understand the flaws that it's known for - over promised and under delivered ""open"" world, so-so driving mechanics, and some graphical glitches. My view may be slightly tainted by the fact that I played this game after having actively avoided shooters for a couple years and purchased it a few years after it came out, so I paid very little for it and played it after all of the patches were released. Having said that, I had a blast with this game. The shooting mechanics and ""feel"" of the guns is one of, if not the best I've every played, and I enjoyed the atmosphere, enemies and NPCs. The story was not great but I wasn't expecting it to be. The single biggest detriment to the fun of the game for me was the backtracking, but it only occurs a few times, mostly in sewer tunnels and other indoor environments. Some people like their games to last 100s of hours, but if you are like me and tend to lose interest in games when they get long in the tooth (Borderlands), then you will still be having fun when this game ends, which is a plus.If you haven't played this and can get it on sale, and you enjoyed the mechanics of Wolfenstein: New Order, I would highly recommend it.

												This is a game, IMHO that gets canned for being what it should be.  It's a mini-mad max.  If you played Mad Max, or think you want to but want to play something similar, this is it.  Awesome fun game, very replayable for me, looks great on PC.  A great game if you want combat where you don't have to memorise the seven sequence master kill moves for each individual boss.Not an overly difficult game, which is why some people can it.Not an overly long game either, which is why some people can it.But definitly solid and worth playing, if you like this kind of thing.A solid 8.5/10 for me.Having now complete the campaign on PC, it's taken me about 20hrs, completing most of the side missions and getting about 50% of the steam achievements on one playthrough.This game is definitely solid value that is exactly what it pretends to be.  So it's not perfectly an open world environment - who cares!!!  So you revisit some locations a couple of times (they're slightly different each time) this doesn't bother me either.The atmosphere is great, the graphics are very good especially considering a console port.If anything, considering the price I'd bump my rating to 9/10.Get it if you like FPS.

												RAGE was mostly a boring generic FPS with a cliff hanger ending that disappointed me even more than the game play.While playing this game the only weapon I ever used consistantly was the shotgun. The shotgun pretty much does everything all the other guns wont. once you get ahold of the shotgun upgrade it and spend the rest of your money on ammo and armor and healing items because running up point blank and blasting nearly every bullet sponge enemy will get you almost an instant kill or it'll take 2-3 shots.The game seems at odds with it self it wants to be a realistic FPS but it also wants to be borderlands and mad max at the same time but doesn't have a big enough world or time to set such things up. It's very clear ID or bethesda wanted to do so much more with this game but it was forced out the door in a some what unfinished state which leads to it's awful ending and it's lack of any real world building. I didn't care about anyone I came across or even my own main character because.... HE DOESN'T TALK. Silent main characters can work but they can be so damn boring sometimes and this is one of those boring cases.The enemies are boring bullet sponges that will have you groaning as you fight them rather than cheering for some action before too long. I'm pretty sure ID or bethesda just sat around playing borderlands and said ""we can make it more realistic"" and I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not there are actually psychos from borderlands in this game. they're called the Jackals and they just spit out a fake cave man mad man language that sounds like the psychos from borderlands.The only truely good thing I can say about this game is that the female NPC's looked very well animated and diverse for the most part. You'll see repeat faces and find many of the NPC's teleporting from one area to another and it'll have you going ""huh.. weren't you just down stairs""The voice acting made me go ""hey that's John Goodmen, Oh that's Steve Blum"" but never surprised me or impressed me with any emotional scenes. These people are just basically mission information dumps and No one sounds like they had fun at all with their roles.about around 78% of the time I didn't know where the hell to go if the town had a person I needed to talk to or a person to take a mission from due to there being no in town map or navagation. The implications of this make me believe this game was originally meant to be linear or mission based and not an open world. There are only 2 town hubs in the game and one is surprisingly more cool but more confusing to navagate than the other.The graphics HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥What happened to the graphics. Summery: Things look beautiful from a distance when you get close they look like PURE♥♥♥♥♥♥Basically if you walk to close to anything that isn't an NPC you'll see a very ugly and disgusting low res texture that would make you think you were playing an N64 game. I've seen what the ID tech 5 engine can do in the hands of other game developers but apparently ID can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥with their own engine because everything about this game's texture work is ugly.as for the story it's all over the place. it's cleary they didn't have enough time to make ANYTHING happen the way they wanted. the ARK's that all these ""amazing"" people are barely talked about and are incredibly confusing. you get called an ARK person by everyone but nothing interesting comes from it. after playing this I see where they got Ideas for doom and THANK GOD doom was actually good because if it was like this I'd never trust ID again.needless to say don't buy this game at full price. I recommend it but just barely. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is so under-rated. The car versus car action I could take or leave, but the FPS sections (i.e. most of the game) are sublime. Some of the best realised locations I have ever seen and excellent enemies with great AI, delivering visceral and extremely enjoyable combat (SOOOO much better than the combat in the average CoD, for example). A criminally under-rated masterpiece. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Short: An unsuccessful blend of genresThe Long:With a setting very much like Fallout 3, RAGE instead focuses on being a straight 3D Shooter (not surprisingly given that it’s an id-game) and throws in some fancy driving/racing for good measure. But all these elements never quite gel. The driving feels very much like an afterthought to amp up the game (or an attempt to channel Mad Max 2) but not only does this feel like a separate game within the game (which the racing basically is) but it very much sabotages any kind of open world feeling games like Fallout 3 offer, since you don’t explore the world, you simply drive through it … fast!Also the pacing of the campaign is terrible. It’s basically the concept of a linear shooter disguised as a RPG quest system. The player is rushed from one mission to the next. There are few side quests, mostly lazily designed by revisiting a previous location playing it backwards from end to start the second time. RPG elements are rudimentary and never quite pay off.Characters are superficial and you never get emotionally invested in their stories or fates. But at least the voice acting is fairly good.The storyline is badly constructed. Starting from the initial point from the player being rescued by Hagar just to be send out again to do missions, over establishing the faceless Authority (which way too  much looked like Half-Life 2’s Combine troops) as villains before even properly explaining what makes them villainous, to shoving the player towards joining a Resistance he knows little about. As in fact the whole background of this world is never properly established.On the bright side the game looks very good and plays quite well as a shooter. The locations are well designed, with a decent amount of attention to detail.In my opinion the game would have been better had it focused on being a 3D Shooter. Driving could still have been part of the game, but in a way harmonious to the gameplay (e.g. like Far Cry 2 - as mediocre as that game was).The way it is RAGE pretends to be more than it is and fails on living up to that pretense. It’s not a bad game, but playing it leaves one disappointed because it promised more than it delivered. The ending is also fairly unsatisfactory, but I assume the developers pretty much envisioned it with some ""RAGE 2"" in mind. In a better game it would have disappointed me. Here I really didn't care.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First, I want to say I think they should of put more resources into the writing staff.  As you can tell from the other reviews, the end is pretty bad.  But it isn't just this.  There are these choppy transitions, as well as events that totally negate actions that your character just fought over.  It makes no sense.Secondly, the main reason why I do not particularly like this game, is the enemy AI.  What gets remotely difficult are the bandits that run at you, but you can pistol shoot them two or three times, and then melee them, and they drop.  The wing blade helps, but let me get to that in a second.  Or, just use a shotgun.  I literally had the BFG gun, and I used it once in the last dungeon.  I pretty much used the shotgun in the very last fight.  The shot gun wrecks face, and a lot of these enemies run into your face.But that's not the only aspect of the AI that's bad.Enemies with a gun, will hide behind cover, and literally stick their head and upper torso out from covery, to just LOOK.  They don't shoot at you, it isn't quick, they literally position themselves there, and look.  So yeah, I'm going to shoot them.  But it's incredibly dumb.  It turns into this waiting game, because they peak out of cover and you just shoot two to three bullets at a time, and you maximize on the amount of ammo saved, and you don't get hit!  You just have to be patient.I didn't like how there was such a strong limit on the race track.  They make a huge deal about decking out your vehicles, but there isn't nearly enough racing credits to be able to do that.  You start decking out one car, and then another comes along, and you start decking that car out.  Which means, you don't have a fully decked out car.  That annoys me.  :)I wish they didn't increase the difficulty of the game by increasing the amount of ammo it takes to kill a guy.  Like, there has to be some other way.  By increasing the amount of ammo you use, it essentially decreases the amount of money that you have because you have to buy ammo for the next ""dungeon.""  This component, actually makes money worth something in this game.  However, it is there because it takes a stupid amount of bullets to kill someone.The writing and AI were the two main things that really took away from this game.  It was enjoyable, but I felt dissapointed, especially during the last dungeon.  If you are going to get this game, get it cheap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved it. Great playability, straight forward, brutal, the punch of the guns, the really really cool design of the characters, the whole ambient.

There is a background to the whole thing, where we are and why we came to this place and time and what has happened to the world and then a way to fix it and regain hope in a better future. in between lots of cool missions and car races. Its all good! The game itself doesn't need anything else and I'd recomend it 100%. Its just that I find all these designs so so cool that I would love to play in all this environement with a more complex storyline... and with a more dense storyline, a much longer game. Even if it ment to have sequels... part 2, 3, 4, etc. Anyway, I'd wear a Rage t-shirt anytime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok...first, the good stuff: I really enjoyed the animation and the gameplay action of RAGE.  I particularly liked the sounds, which gave the weapons exquisite and unique textures - some of the best sounds of any RPG I've played.  Moreover, the opportunity to craft weapons and items is really cool.Now, the bad stuff:TOO EASY:I played Hard and I got through most of the final mission with a Settler pistol and a machine gun.  Granted, I didn't try Nightmare level, but I don't imagine it would be too much more difficult.WORST ASPECTS:RAGE was way too short (which is the main reason I wouldn't recommend this game: I love to be immersed in a large world and narrative, and this game really has neither).It was also quite difficult to find my way around the game at the beginning - I found myself having to hop online several times to find out how to get to certain menus (since even the PC version is tailored to a console interface).Moreover, RAGE is the Dexter of RPGs, with absolutely, undoubtedly the most anticlimactic, lacklustre, disappointing ending of any RPG I've ever played.  It's as if they ran out of budget close to the end and some CEO told them to wrap it up quick!  I know most don't care about this, but the grammar used to describe the missions reads like the bad undergraduate essays I have to mark.  Come on, Bethesda - pick up your game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like this game, the story is nice. Wish it wasn't trying to be Mad Max, they should of added a few things. But otherwise feels sorta like a old Doom 3 or Quake feel of combat to ME of course. But the textures do take a whiel to load, after loading a area, which I can wait 15 secs to let them. But otherwise it looks fine, I can go back and forth later on in the game. Wish there was more areas. Even if it's DLC. But whatever 8/10 game, stuff is missing but it's a solid game.

												Rage Review.I just beat the game a few minutes ago and my first initial reaction was...was that it? I beat the game and most side quests in about 12 hours and was left feeling like the game ended in act 2 when it should have had at least 4 acts, if that makes any sense. This review contains minor spoilers.  Overall storyline was a 5 out of 10. Definitely a fail. I didn't feel invested to any of the characters or even the faction I was fighting for, the Resistence. Vehicle Combat again a 5 out of 10. It was horrible but it wasn't overly fun.  Very basic driving, and it felt like a mechanic that was added to the game just for a bit of filler. Ground Combat 7 out of 10. The game does  a bit better here. At times the combat turned towards a very Serious Sam type feel as hordes of enemies bear down on you, which I've never been crazy about. The AI of the combat is poor and the only challenging parts of the ground combat was when they put hordes of enemy against you in a very close room, otherwise all other enemies could be fought every easily by simly moving backwards and having the enemies come to you.Weapons 7 out of 10. Very basic weapons. The upgrades for the weapons were nice but not enough of them. The customized ammo was a nice addition but I felt like their could have big a bigger variety instead of just more powerful bullets (essentially). No weapon in particular stuck out as being really cool. They do have a mind control weapon but IMO they messed it up and it's not very fun with limited effectiveness. Quests 6 out of 10. The have a very repetetive feel to it.  Quests didn't endear me towards certain characters. Graphics  6-7 out of 10. When you think of this game, think Borderlands Graphics. Everything looks semi-painted on the screen and while I wouldn't give Borderlands a lower rating I would this game.  Borderlands has a very unique atmosphere, it has some very beatiful landscapes that add a sense of mystery to the game.  Rage for all it's painted landscapes doesn't offer anything really unique. And because effort wasn't put into making this stand out with interesting textures it gets a lower rating.Other thoughts The game is incredibly linear. If you want to explore a new area, you pretty much need to quest to be able to interact with the environment. The game feels very similar to Borderlands without the funny jokes or interesting landscapes. Overall the game felt rushed, linear and very short. Overall I'd rate the game a generous 6 out of 10.

												With CONTROLLER ON for driving, RAGE asks me to HIT ENTER TO START yet every other prompt in the game is Xbox controller centric.  Why? I'm not using a controller during the non driving segments.  ALTTAB to desktop results in the loss of VSYNCH everytime.  Rocket Rally isn't fun and the races and time trials are too easy.   Music is lost when loading from inside the game until I guess the folks at id think I'm worthy.  A myriad of ultra cool quick use items await yet I can only bind them to 4 keys.  The variances in ammo per weapon are amazing yet to cycle ammo in a weapon that holds 4 types I have to cycle through each with full change ammo animations to get to the one I desire.  Car combat is poorly designed, the Car AI stinks and the mounted minigun is worthless due to the superiority of the other mounted weapons.  Textures are trash and id should be embarassed. Usage of RED X's and ! signs in game break immersion.Combat,Guns,Ammo,AI movement and all animations are the best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

General ThoughtsInteresting little FPS.  I did enjoy playing, however there were a few things that drive me a little batty.  There was an interesting story that ended aburptly right when it was getting good.  Once completeled I was left with a feeling of, ""That's It?!?""  While the game is visually stunning, it did suffer from some issues like LOD popup constantly.  Thankfully these can be 99% eliminated with custom configs.  All in all I had fun playing the game.  I just wished for a more climatic ending.The Good Solid Shooting Mechanics Quest Driven Storyline Adaptive AI Plenty of Eye Candy Caters to multiple playstyles Plenty of timesink distractions (minigames, racing, gambling to name a few) Rewards explorationThe Bad Story Abruptly Ends Funky graphic issues (mostly fixable with custom configs) Crazy economy.   You'll consistently be dumping your earnings into ammo. Vehicles a bit wonky for keyboard/mouse controls.  Controller recommended. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I LOVE  this game, if you like fallout, borderlands, and mad maxx, then welcome home cuz they just got together with a new wastland and man it's brutal.    made by Bethesda you should already expect a great game no there's no skills no character creation, kind of a linear story but the world and the things you can do are endless and fun. every mission will usually involve your vehicle in every way (here's where the customization and the mad maxx theme come in. within your 1st hour hour and half of the game your gunna get your first vehicle done right? NOPE once you get your own vehicle now it's time to beef it up with a wastland style of pimp my ride.  you need to win races in town (and man they're addicting especially when you win and get good rewards for your vehicle) to get tickets for an npc to upgrade your vehicle in anyway you want cuz lets face it an open world wastland is gunna be filled with bandits and vehicles of thier own, so your gunna want to make that baby look as bad♥♥♥♥♥as you can. gunplay feels just as smooth and is fun especially exploring sewers where the mutants live, and it's creepy down there but you'll get good loot.   loot EVERYTHING and kill EVERYTHING do as many jobs as you can cuz 80% of the money you make in this game will go towards your vehicle if anything if you choose, you can also spend upgrades on armor, and weapon  mods, so come to the wastland and prepare to RAGE at everything you see!!     only $10 for an awesome Bethesda game just do it i know your contemplating it.

												I've owned the game for years but other than a couple of half hearted starts where I barely put half an hour into it each time I've never played it, Until last week that is.I've just finished my first playthrough which was on Nightmare difficulty, It took over 30 hours to complete and I managed to get 60% of the achievements (which is good for me). I really enjoyed the game, I had no crashes, no bugs and great performance (60 fps at all times) with everything maxed on a 60hz 1080p monitor with vsr pushing it at 1440p. Visually it looks great tooFrom what I remember this game was never one that got rave reviews and I just don't know why.It's a good looking, enjoyable game and the most important thing is that it is what a game should be. FUN. It's quite an old game now meaning you can often pick it up dirt cheap but even at the current price without a sale deal it is well worth getting. If you haven't ever played Rage and it looks like your thing don't wait no longer. Treat yourself as I'm sure you'll enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you just ignore for a moment the fact that something that could've been a great free-roam, Borderlands experience, This games damage models are awful, on ""normal"" difficulty it takes around 3 headshots on an unarmoured, regular enemy. Couple that with their nice free running attack patterns, making them even more difficult to hit.I spent the majority of this game trying to get as many stealth kills as possible, to avoid the only other valid tactic of spraying the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of every. single. guy.The only useful weapons are the shotgun and the assault rifle. The LMG has a pathetic magazine and♥♥♥♥♥♥damage, The sniper rifle is only useful for certain 'defend the dude' side quests. The bow is used as the sole way to get stealth kills.The pistol has 12 rounds, of which you will use at least 8 killing one guy, if you dont headshot him, or you use the Fatboy rounds, and dont ♥♥♥♥ing miss.The rocket launcher is used to kill a few big enemies.Considering this came from the guys who made Quake, its a good job I only paid £3 for it. No charm, no depth, no fun and every sodding thing you do is a fetch mission.This is as bad as Serious Sam 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Other than that it's an okay game for the 5 dollars I paid. And that's what you get, a five dollar game that feels like the devs just didn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's a faux free roam game, the game is linear with invisible walls galore. It has a mini map, but no world map. WTF? The game had potential, but they♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it away. It felt rushed and incomplete. And it feels even more incomplete when you learn the game was to have multiple DLCs and was abandoned. I let curiosity get the better of me and bought the game when I should have left it abandoned.

												In spite of all the critical acclaim for RAGE, id has made a boring cross between Borderlands and ... well, generic shooterness. The graphics aren't anything to really write about despite the praise heaped on it and the sound effects are terrible. Story and animation isn't particularly engaging either, and vehicle handling isn't particularly interesting either. There isn't much customization to the vehicles either, with just one upgrade per customization type, apart from the tires.Oh, and it doesn't really run smoothly, either.While this game can be some decent entertainment for a while, it doesn't live up to any of its claims. Actual missions are nothing but corridors.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To put it succinctly, Rage was designed to look good in screen shots.  Graphics engine performance, low-res textures, and confining invisible walls are glaring weak performers.For the graphics engine, id relies on Tech 5 version of their in-house developed engine circa 2011.  It is plainly developed with consoles in mind and not the higher performance standards of today's PCs.  Texture pop-ins are unavoidable even after implementing patches and id-suggested tweaks.  I've never seen pop-ins so bad on a modern game.  Pop-ins are extremely evident when you turn your character and terrain textures appear as extremely low-res for a split second before the engine loads the higher resolution texture.  It's kind of sad that id doesn't have the shiniest, red-hot, smokin'-est game engine.  Especially since they've always been crap for story--the graphics were always the ""but at least it looks AMAZING!!"" fall back.  Not anymore.I don't understand the prevalent use of extremely low-res textures for items and objects in your immediate viscinity.  It's mind-boggling.  I can't fathom how anyone thinks that was a good idea for a PC release. Now, there are some post-release tweaks you can do to some config files that will load higher resolution textures but it's odd that they make you do that little tweak yourself.Lastly, another unavoidable issue is the ""on-rails"" feeling of the areas.  Invisible walls are prevalent and obnoxious.  Call it console-itis.  It's a sad artifact of porting from a console.Some high points are the character's facial animations and the models themselves.  They're quite nice and rival any of the better implementations seen in LA Noire or even Borderlands 2.The ""crafting"" and RPG elements, while not amazing, are strong enough to lend some depth to the game especially for an id story.  I've no real complaints there.All in all, I purchased the game for $5 and that's about what I think the game is worth on the PC.  It's worth a shot at a low price point. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Technological abortion that is MEGATEXTURES notwithstanding, RAGE is not a bad game.  Unfortunately, as AAA games are wont to do, cramming in every mainstream gameplay gimmick like racing, 'open world,' tacked-on multiplayer, rpg lite elements, etc. end up watering down the shooter aspect and results in something that plays like shallower version of Borderlands.   Had id focused on level design and improved AI this would be a much better game.  The fact that this took six plus years and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop is inexplicable (yet par for the course for AAA).All of that said the setting is atmopsheric, the outdoor visuals are pretty, and you're provided with a variety of guns and gadgets to blow stuff up.  A colossal mismanagement of time and money but still an enjoyable experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My initial impressions of Rage left me with disappointment. As a huge fan of the DOOM franchise, I was expecting the id Tech 5 engine to be the basis for DOOM's next installment. So I saw Rage as the engine's test title. While it impressed me graphically, I felt the many subgames within the game got in the way of the plot. I didn't want to spend my time racing or playing cards. I was here to chew bubble gum and kick♥♥♥♥♥ and I was all out of bubble gum. When I got to the end of the campaign, I felt like there could've been more. Then when DOOM never materialized after two Wolfenstein releases and The Evil Within, I felt unsatisfied even more.After a nearly 5 year hiatus, I'm reinstalling it now to start over and give it a second chance. Now that I have my DOOM keeping me happy, perhaps I'll find more to enjoy in Rage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Frankly, I'd feel really ripped off if I'd gotten this game for more than five bucks during a sale.Narrative-wise, it's got nothing going for it. A standard jacked, non-speaking white guy wakes up after an apocalypse and is really good at shooting stuff. There are the obvious mutants and bandit clans, and an authoritarian regime with all the fancy electronics. There are also rebels, and they take a liking to you (for no obvious reason--your character is as bland as they come) and you wind up being the chosen one they've been waiting for to help take control for the good of the people.As much as I love overthrowing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ governments, the rebel characters are all just as bland as you are, they have absolutely no moral complexity (every character falls into the categories of A: kind of annoyed with the oppressive regime and naively waiting around for a Messiah or B: shooting you in the face screaming gibberish), and the story barely wraps up. It's obvious that the game was counting on a sequel  to pull it together, but all the big reveals are already glaringly obvious and I can't see anyone being engaged enough to buy another one.Gameplay-wise, it's almost a bit better. The FPS elements are pretty solid--there's a nice blend of enemies who shoot from cover, stand out in the open with big guns blazing, and leap at you from crazy angles, so you get to play around with your strategy a bit. But even that gets old by the end, and the painfully average vehicle levels (which feel like they were thrown in as an afterthought) don't do nearly enough to break it up. I managed to play all the way through by making a personal challenge to use nothing but crossbow headshots, but frig was that ending ever /not/ worth the work.Basically, if you like the cutthroat FPS combat in gritty, scenic tunnels, you should get Bioshock instead, and if you like the shooter/racer duality in a wasteland survival setting, you should get a PS2 emulator and Jak III. I suppose that's my beef with this game, for everything kinda good about it (the crossbow and the cute steampunk NPCs are literally it for me), there are a dozen other games that do it much better, and have a much more positive overall experience.Don't needlessly subject yourself to this inanity.

												Rage is a game brought you by Id Software ( Makers of Doom ) and Bethesda (Skyrim,Fallout, Dishonored). When the gamewas first released it was considered one of the best looking games on the market. Rage is set in wasteland Mad Max type of setting. the story in this game is weak but not horrible. The voice acting, animations, and graphics are all great. The Gameplay is also great. Theres something for just about everyone in this game. Rage is a FPS that has 3 different character  traits to chose from. You can chose one of them each with thier own benefits. Rage features side quests, Boss battles, crafting,Combat driving, and more. Rage also features Co-Op gameplay ( Not in Campaign ) and multiplayer Online. Although this game is older and there is almost never anyone online to play with. This game is definitely worth atleast one play through.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Creatively bankrupt. There was hardly a shred of this game that didn't feel lazily borrowed from some other, better game, it should have had twice as much content, and most of the side missions involved running through the same instanced 'dungeons' you'd already been through once.

												This game looks good. Real good. However after several hours worth of struggling with drivers and fixes on the Steam forums I couldn't even get the mouse to work. I've verified the issue is only in RAGE as a quick Google search results in plenty of other people who can't get their mouse working either and this game has already been out for several years at this point. I downloaded this on a free weekend and still feel like I got robbed somehow. What a waste of time. Pass.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE.The plus points about this game are overlooked by all the negatives. I bought this game hoping it was an open world, exploration game, sort of like Fallout or Borderlands. I was very mistaken because this game is very much story driven and although initially, you get to explore a bit, but afterwards, it feels very linear. The fact that you can't even open your map(wtf, you can't explore without seeing a map) says a lot about ""exploring"" the world in the description of the game. The combat is also very..shaky, so to say because, well firstly, you can't reload while running and secondly you hesitate for a second to shoot after aiming. There's a small pause in shooting even though you've aimed. Its very irritating if you're not used to it. Other than that, you don't get a lot of side quests unless you absolutely exhaust dialogue with anyone you can talk to. This might infuriate someone, might not. Combat with cars is very aggressive as you can actually die if you're not careful even if your car is at full health. The plus points would be the graphics & textures and the realism of the game. but that is about it.I also hate the fact that so many doors in so many buildings are just ""closed"". It completely ruins the feeling of exploring the world. It just puts you on a very linear path of ""do this and go here"" instead of ""don't do this, just explore stuff and come back and do this."" You can't do that. I almost feel like this game can be compared to Singularity or Crysis because of the linear quest line and your inability to explore the world. The AI racing bots can be easily beaten in races. They're not even a threat after the first lap if you race well. Also, this game is really huge; around 18GB. All in all, I was highly disappointed from this game because I was expecting SO much more and it failed to give me what I had in mind. That being said, this was my opinion and I know people like this game a lot but I did not like it all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												All the issues with this this game can be summed up in one statement. ""Not optimized for PC."" Given the pedigree behind this, that's unacceptable.There are disappearing elements of the HUD, pop in textures, all the prompts using x-box controls, or that in many menus (including the defibrillator mini-game) won't accept the corresponding button input. Looking in any direction causes the worst chopping I've ever seen in a game.There could be a great game in here, but it's unplayable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is almost like a ""Fallout-lite."" With a linear storyline and fairly intuitive controls, this game is great as a first-time post-apocalypse game exposure. The fights can be challenging, but the Easy difficulty setting mitigates that. The racing mechanic is easy to learn, but the control is somewhat erratic (although that could be user issues). The DLCs are fun extras, and I wish there were more. Overall, RAGE is an enjoyable (if short) game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The shooting is great.Open world but story is very linear; lots of backtracking which is made worst by the fact that exploration rewards very little.Driving plays a big part in the game (need to race to progress through the story) but the handling of all vehicles, even with the performance tires and engine tuning, is clunky.I would recommend Borderlands or Mad Max over RAGE.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												tldr; first, then further reading below:Pros:- Beautiful game. From the graphics to the color choices to the excellent level aesthetics, RAGE has an immersive world to explore.- Plenty of tense, enjoyable moments blasting everything from raging mutants to the coordinated assaults of the authority- Enemy animations are a joy to watch. Enemies jump, duck, roll, climb from the ceiling and react to hits from your weapons in a way no other game does- Mixes up the standard shooter genre with driving sections, a light crafting system and different ammo types for most guns offering various ways to use weaponry in interesting waysCons:- The ending is cut short with a fairly anticlimactic assault sequence- Driving mechanics and AI are not as well fleshed out as could be, almost an afterthought for the way some of it works- Multiplayer feels tacked on with the co-op missions being rehashed levels of the campaign and racing that feels dry and boring- Fairly easy game, even on the ultra nightmare difficulty added by the DLCRating: 4/5RAGE... It's a game that a lot of people like to hate on. Looking at it from a perspective purely focused on game design and implementation, yes RAGE is lacking. There's one thing that most people don't take into account when enjoying games however and that is the perspective from games as art. From that standpoint, ID nails it with RAGE. It's a simply beautiful game that stands the test of time even now and because of that:I LOVE RAGEBy far some of the most fun I've had with the game has been bullet spraying, sniping, shotgunning, wingsticking or otherwise pulverizing enemies and seeing their death and reaction animations. Having enemies duck and dodge at the last second, swing across the ceiling and stumble and roll as they're shot in the shoulder is extremely satisfying to watch. It makes the game much more immersive than most shooters where enemies stand there and then die like robots repeating the same motions over and over.The graphics help with this and to this day RAGE has some of the best looking graphics there is. The textures may not hold up to modern ones but the overall aesthetic and graphical fidelity certainly does. RAGE looks gorgeous, check out some of the screenshots I or others have taken and see for yourself the colorful environments that are pleasantly in line with the setting of the game. Ruined cruise ships sitting on top of cities made from industrial steel sheets, a town converted from an old subway station, a maniacal TV host with a carnival themed arena of death, RAGE continues to amaze with each chapter of the game fitting a well crafted post apocalyptic theme.Also of note is the attempt by ID to try new things with the standard shooter genre. Weapons have alternate ammunition types which alter the way they're used, some to a greater degree than others. There's also a light crafting system in the game that lets you construct items from health bandages to stationary turrets and even robotic spider turrets. While the game doesn't ever require you to need these items as even on the hardest difficulty the game can be completed without any of them, it's a nice addition that does allow for some different approaches to combat if desired.---RAGE does have it's negative sides however and it's unfortunate that this is all some people see in the game. It's been heavily criticized for it's ending sequence and yes, it does leave something to be desired. The last half of the game in general does seem rushed and not as creative as the first half although again the aesthetic and attention to detail is still there. Even right to the end the game each sequence is fantastic to behold with the level, enemy and weapon design being the saving grace for me.With the mechanics ID added to mix up the genre they came close to creating something magical but ended up stumbling a bit in the implementation. The driving mechanics first of all could have been done better. While it's fun to turbo boost yourself around the wasteland firing machine guns and rockets at other cars in a Twisted Metal fashion, the vehicle controls and enemy AI do feel lackluster compared the rest of the game mechanics. An afterthought kind of feeling can't help but be conveyed especially after your tenth or so race with the enemy cars driving ever so cautiously behind you as not to be too hard on you but not too easy on you either and then immediately dumping their ammo supply upon pickup in a very predictable way.While appreciated, the crafting and ammo system is also somewhat lackluster in it's implementation because while everything in the game is indeed fun to use on it's own, the game is not balanced well enough nor ever requires you to use any of what's given to complete the game. In fact if you play on normal difficulty you can very easily use nothing but the shotgun and the occasional showing of a rifle for the entire game. The disconnect between the ideas in the game and the implementation in conjunction with the enemy AI shows although. Again however, the fun in using the available mechanics is there should you choose to enjoy the game in it's fullest.One more thing to note and is as much of an afterthought as the mode itself is the multiplayer element. While nice to have, multiplayer does indeed feel tacked on offering two modes that are entirely forgettable. First there is a co-op mission mode but the missions are just rehashed levels from the campaign. You and your partner compete for points by killing enemies the fastest and most efficient. The other mode is up to four player races and destruction derbys that are more fun than the co-op mode but the race mechanics are dry enough that it doesn't redeem it as something that will last you more than a few plays.---Overall I certainly enjoyed my time with RAGE, enough to buy the DLC and complete the achievements. It's going up as one of my favorite shooters despite it's flaws and it's a game I wholeheartedly recommend everyone try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												5/10On the surface, RAGE is a great game. Great graphics, the gameplay is smooth, the vehicle integration is great, and the item based system is actually seamless. HOWEVER, I do not recommend this game as it has literally no story line. All those side quests you play in Skyrim, or pretty much any RPG now, that's exactly what this whole entire game is, a side quest. The character has no backstory, no progression, you aren't told what's going on until three quarters through the game (you can accurately assume the story, but no concrete statements are given). Even after you are told what's going on, it's not even a solid plot! There is no end game bad guy, there is no final boss, there isn't anything!I played on Hard right away, as I usually do with games, and it was WAY too easy. I never fully died, only went into the 'downed' state three or four times. You make money way too easily when you get a half decent card deck, and there isn't really anything to buy. There are a ton of guns which is great, but at a certain point the alternate ammunition is so powerful, that you can just use the shotgun for every enemy and one shot them on Hard difficulty. I realize there is nightmare and 'ultra' nightmare, but one shotting end game guys on Hard shouldn't be an option. Also, if you just use wing sticks through the entire game, you'll never die, and decapitate multiple guys in one shot. Hide behind a corner, pop out, throw the stick, hide, wait a second, and pop out to catch it.Those game mechanics break this game. The wing stick makes the few middle game bosses extremely easy as well, just shoot them all in the head a handful of times and death. What I'm saying is, this game is a level of easy that shouldn't be allowed in mature games.Lastly, they push you to go out and explore in the loading screens constantly, but there isn't anything to explore. The handful of areas that you can explore, are all tied to missions. This is a game that tries to make it seem like you can explore but really just forces you down a set path, it's almost useless to get out and explore because you'll end up going back to the same place, only this time no extra loot. AND the job boards that add the equivalent of side quests, they just send you right back to the same places that the main mission sends you. I'd say there are probably 15 explorable areas in this game, and each one you go to multiple times. Save your money folks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me tell you a story. Bought game. Installed game. Couldn't play game. Updated graphics drivers. Updating graphics drivers disabled my graphics drivers control panel ( huh?). Tried to play game. Game plays! BUT... it locks up every 5 seconds for 1 second. So basically unplayable. Tried to figure out how to fix. Adjusted settings up, adjusted them down. Googled. Found solution. Must change setting in graphics driver control panel. Can't do that. ♥♥♥♥ U JOHN CARMACK!Amendment: Okay, so in January of the year of our lord 2013, AMD updates their drivers again, and I install the update for Bioshock: Infinite. Check real quick, and yes i can use graphics driver control panel. Reinstall RAGE(!!) and loandbehold it works perfectly. This game is♥♥♥♥♥ I mean, its just bland and unexciting, with the only really interesting bits being the visual detailwork. EXCEPT, texture warps are ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere. If you turn your head even slightly every single texture in the game loads right in front of your eyes. Yes, megatextures sounds like the worlds best ♥♥♥♥ing idea, but if you can't implement it properly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage has a lot of problems…. Now I love ID games but rage is worse than brink and brink was quite bad itself I will leave that for a different review… What is wrong with rage’s story:Rage has a very short story that could be told in a few sentences to a few paragraph in video format it could  be told in 30 seconds and nothing would be lost. Nothing at all…. Once you get to what you think would be the end of the introduction to the story you are already 2/3rds the way through the game. Once the story starts to pick up the game just ends in one of the worst ways I have seen in a game. Nothing is explains, the big confendation with the “Bad guys” which has no face or character behind them or explaining why they are “bad guys” other than they make a mutant army and they want you to help them  to crush a small resistances group makes little to no since at all.The Sewers DLC:You are greeted with a man claiming there are sewers you can access throughout all of the game you just have to look for them. Guess what I only found the one sewer and I looked.The Authority Pack DLC:You get a set of armor that combines what all the other armors pick, making it pointless to pick from them. A car that is not worth using at all. You also get a double barrel saw off shotgun which is over powered. The gameplay:It’s a choir typical random door closes can’t move on till everything in rooms are dead. Wash rise repeat for most of the game. A few boss like mutants none at the end of the game other than mutants with guns which are still easy to kill and not a threat at all. Just save your ammo and punch them.  Has a racing part and driving parts which are meh. The over all game:The game suffers from a identity crisis it trys too hard to be a fallout, wasteland, borderlands clone with no depth to it's story or gameplay then randomly tries to be a racing game. Then near the end of the game tries to be like a game it should have been to begin with. Then it just cuts short right when I actually started to enjoy it. It’s a waste of money a waste of space, and a waste of ID’s time clearly Bethesda rushed ID to finish it because the engine, story, and gameplay is so bad. There is nothing to redeem itself.

												This game is a disgrace to the gaming community.Pros: The game has a fitting name.Cons:1. There's no autosaving, meaning that if you don't save for a long time and you die, you get sent back to the point in time that you saved the last time.So, I saved in the beginning of a dungeon. I then completed the dungeon in about 30 minutes, and then got out and hopped on a vehicle and started driving, and when I got out, I clipped through the ground. http://steamcommunity.com/id/FallingFist/screenshot/3281173896709564961There was no way to get back up, other than reloading that 30 minutes old save, which I obviously don't want to re-do.I know what you're thinking, but:2. There's no fast traveling. There's so much driving back and forth, and it's really boring after some time, and if there were fast traveling, I wouldn't be stuck in this situation, falling through the ground.3. Invisible walls. They're everywhere. I'm not even joking. Every place possible. The entire world is linear and horribly boring and pale, and you can't even jump over a 2 foot fence because of the invisible walls.4. The textures. Everything in the world that you're not looking at is unloaded until you start looking at it. This means that if you turn around quickly, the textures will have to load properly, which sometimes takes up to 2 seconds. This could easily have been fixed with motion blur or something. I guess this is good if you have a bad computer, but in that case you should probably consider getting a better one. It's 2014. 5. The modding community never took off. I realize that this isn't ID's and Bethesda's fault, but the companies never even released a proper dev kit. WHY EVEN HAVE SUPPORT FOR MODS WHEN YOU WON'T GIVE THE DEVS SOMETHING TO WORK WITH!? All in all, I strongly recommend you to not buy this game. It's most definitely not worth 20 euros. In fact, don't even buy it on sale. If you want a futuristic RPG, play Borderlands 2.

												Another game I bought on release, stopped playing then picked it up later to finish. Where to begin?- Release for this game had a BUNCH of problems. Most notable was the Megatexture system they tried. While they fixed most of it. Some of the problems still linger, such as texture pop in, blurry and mushed textures. Like any other games associated with Bethesda. The game looks great indoors and at close ranges, looking into the distance is nothing but blobs and blotches.- The Gunplay is alright. There is some downs, some ups. But most of all, it stays average throughout the entire game. There is a good assortment of weapons and equipment you can use. But you'll just find yourself sticking to the same few weapons throughout the game, as using anything else is rather pointless.Lets start off with the Wingsticks. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥these things are OP. There is no reason to use any other sort of equipment besides these. HE Grenades take to detonate, and won't always kill everyone. Turrets take forever to kill someone and can be destroyed with a few shots. Wingsticks however, once thrown will fly towards the enemy and one shot them, occasionally they'll fly back or you can pull them out of their skull. Which makes it easy to keep a surplus of them, later on in the game you can upgrade them so they'll fly around walls or cover, kill multiple people and then come back. You could compete the game no problem only using wingsticks.Some of the equipment is useless, or very situational. You do a quest in the first zone to get some RC car bombs. During this quest, you can use them to great affect and to complete objectives. They have small tunnels where you can drive these RC bombs through, kill people in cover and all sorts of stuff. However, no where else in the game features these tunnels and all the NPC enemies will focus fire these car bombs down. So there is no reason to use them again.Same thing can be said with all the ammo and weapon types in the game. Once you get a certain type, there is no reason to using anything else. Most of the pistol ammo is useless once you get Fatboys/FatMammas. The Crossbow is completely useless, as there is no stealth in the game so the Sniper Rifle works better for long ranged, all of the bolts are situational and much like the RC cars, useless outside of missions. Including the Mind Control bolts, which are supposed to be a ""superweapon"", but its just quicker and easier to dispatch people with another gun.The Weapon Upgrades, Inventory, Crafting system and everything else feel forgotten about. There is little reason to craft anything, the inventory has no limits. The weapon upgrades can be checked, but they're so few and used for four weapons. In the all, they all feel useless and you'll likely very rarely use any of them.- Racing and driving is seriously the best feature of this game. It handles better than anything else and feels great. - The Story is a mixed bag, I really enjoy the first area to the game. Its much bigger and most of the content takes place here. The theme is nice, people trying to make it by. Bandit and mutant troubles all over the place with people occasionally mentioning ""The Authority"" like they're some big bad. However, as soon as the resistance comes into play, everything else is practically forgotten about and you're thrust in with them with little explanation. By the time you're done listening to people mentioning that they're TOTALLY NOT IN THE RESISTACNE. You go do a quest in the Dead City. Which has a lot of hype built up around it, but in the end, it has little to do with the game. (Not to mention, it has a great atmosphere). You go in there, fight an extremely busy boss and then you're back out again. Then you're thrust into the resistance with no real reason to join them, other than ""The Authority is bad mmkay."" You finally get to run into the Authority and they seem to be a real threat compared to bandits and mutants you've been fighting. But midway through the mission they become a trival experience, as you get everything you need to fight them. Including pulse shots that oneshot them. EMP Grenades, which disable armor and shields, and armor piercing rounds. Which leave little reason to use anything else when fighting them. Besides Wingsticks. After doing all this, you have to do a few more missions, the town you're in starts becoming occupied by Authority. Which provides a good feel and some seriousness to the story. Then you're offered to head to the second area with the Resistance to help take the fight to the Authority and help end them for once and for all. The second area is completely devoid of any good feelings, atmosphere, etc. Its gray and bland. The most interesting thing in the entire area is a broken apart cargo ship. Which is only there for some neat factor. The rest of the story is suddenly thrust into your face and you're dropped in the middle of it. Then its promptly pushed to the side and you need to go do some errands for the towns Mob Boss Mayor and reputation so people don't rat you out to the Authority. However, the latter doesn't really affect anything. If you talk anyone in the town, they'll tell you that they already know who you are and that they're counting on you.You run around, do about 2-3 errands for the Mob Boss so you can get his approval to work out of his city. Which once again, doesn't make any sense due to the entire having been there for ages, and him being anti-authority. (Not to mention, everyone says you need to do this before you can do any sidequest/shopping. But as soon as you talk to him you can do it all anyways without completing any of his quest). So you do them, and then suddenly it doesn't matter anyways, because the Mob Boss was taken away by the Authority. Which gives a feeling of ""Why did I even bother?"" Then you need to go back down and talk to the resistance to carry on.You also have the option to do a few side quest, there is about 1-2 given by NPCs, and a few on the job board you can find. But is insanely lacking compared to the first zone. The second task given to you by the resistance, is to finally take the fight to the authority. You need to go disable some shields on the bridge and finally get to encounter some new Authority units, like their vehicles. However, you can one shot any of the authority vehicles with the pulse cannon on your own. So its another moot point.Once you're at the bridge, you take the lift up kill a few guys (literally about 6-10 guys). Disable the shields and head back to talk to the resistance again. Which then they inform you that you're now at the end of the game and this is the final mission and you're gonna take down the authority. You get in your vehicle, head across the bridge and find a conveniently place side entrance. The final mission is a cake walk, they give you a OP gatling gun so you can blow apart what few enemies you come across. You go through a few hallways, take a elevator ride up. You're now at your objective.It gets even worse, the final ""fight"" of the game is nothing more than a wave attack of about 6 fodder infantry, on three waves. So yeah, a total of 18 weak units. There is no boss fight with the General Cross, who everyone mentions throughout the game. You quickly dispatch these last few units, hit the console. Boom, game done. Cutscenes, credits. Overall, it feels like they ran out of production time. The second zone/part of the story is about 1/4th the content of the first area. The story is hamfisted and shoved in your face, which overall leaves a unsatisfying taste in your mouth. Which is a shame.I could describe a lot of other things, but I'm hitting the character limit. Overall, the game is mediocre and is only worth to buy when on sale for cheap. Its something good to waste a few hours on. But the racing and driving is great. I'd recommend buying it for a few dollars just for that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another game I bought on release, stopped playing then picked it up later to finish. Where to begin?- Release for this game had a BUNCH of problems. Most notable was the Megatexture system they tried. While they fixed most of it. Some of the problems still linger, such as texture pop in, blurry and mushed textures. Like any other games associated with Bethesda. The game looks great indoors and at close ranges, looking into the distance is nothing but blobs and blotches.- The Gunplay is alright. There is some downs, some ups. But most of all, it stays average throughout the entire game. There is a good assortment of weapons and equipment you can use. But you'll just find yourself sticking to the same few weapons throughout the game, as using anything else is rather pointless.Lets start off with the Wingsticks. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥these things are OP. There is no reason to use any other sort of equipment besides these. HE Grenades take to detonate, and won't always kill everyone. Turrets take forever to kill someone and can be destroyed with a few shots. Wingsticks however, once thrown will fly towards the enemy and one shot them, occasionally they'll fly back or you can pull them out of their skull. Which makes it easy to keep a surplus of them, later on in the game you can upgrade them so they'll fly around walls or cover, kill multiple people and then come back. You could compete the game no problem only using wingsticks.Some of the equipment is useless, or very situational. You do a quest in the first zone to get some RC car bombs. During this quest, you can use them to great affect and to complete objectives. They have small tunnels where you can drive these RC bombs through, kill people in cover and all sorts of stuff. However, no where else in the game features these tunnels and all the NPC enemies will focus fire these car bombs down. So there is no reason to use them again.Same thing can be said with all the ammo and weapon types in the game. Once you get a certain type, there is no reason to using anything else. Most of the pistol ammo is useless once you get Fatboys/FatMammas. The Crossbow is completely useless, as there is no stealth in the game so the Sniper Rifle works better for long ranged, all of the bolts are situational and much like the RC cars, useless outside of missions.

												This game came out shortly after the first Borderlands; everyone pretty much agreed the game was basically Borderlands.  Problem was Borderlands had a ton of weapons.  This game, well, I haven't played it in a while, I remember there not being a lot of weapons to choose from; but no more than the numbers on your keyboard.  So, yeah, I'm playing along, nothing special, but eventually start to feel something that feels like enjoyment during the game, when all the damn sudden credits roll and the game is over.  What the hell?  Yeah, super abrupt out-of-no-where ending.  If you love steampunk type stuff, you might like this game.  Otherwise, just play Borderlands.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												All the issues with this this game can be summed up in one statement. ""Not optimized for PC."" Given the pedigree behind this, that's unacceptable.There are disappearing elements of the HUD, pop in textures, all the prompts using x-box controls, or that in many menus (including the defibrillator mini-game) won't accept the corresponding button input. Looking in any direction causes the worst chopping I've ever seen in a game.There could be a great game in here, but it's unplayable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disclaimer: This ""review"" isn't really meant for you, it's meant for Steam so I get better recommendations for games I might like. The first thing I think of when I think of RAGE is: Yawn. Though I love post apocalyptic games I am thoroughly burnt out on 'mindless' first-person shooters where the solution to every problem is shooting someone in the face. Very boring. I actually fell asleep playing this.The story, guns, level design, and gameplay all seemed boring. I had more fun playing Quake in 1996.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I made the big mistake to believe in the many reviews of others before I started to play Rage on my own. Thats why I finished the game like 2 years after release and the most bugs are fixed now I guess.  Anyway, as one of the last survivors of the human race you leave your vault to discover whats left after the apocalypse. You realise quick that there are a lot of others survivors out there which are spending their time in the wasteland. And thats how it begins, you shoot your way through sweet looking caves, mountains, bandit-hideouts and other places where monsters like to hide from the sun. To your assistance you have a big shipload of weapons to murder everything thats dumb enough to pass your way. As example, wingsticks, RC cars with c4, automatic turrets, railguns and way way more stuff. The open world is not really open world...You have in the beginning that feeling that you can do what you want and that there are a lot of places to explore. But in the end every place on the map has a purpose and is part of a quest.  COOP Whats worth getting mentioned is the coop campaign which is a complete seperate storyline and is very challenging either. Grab a mate and murder some guys! All in all I LOVED this game. Due to the many critics, I already had a bad feeling when I started playing... But instead I got blasted away by the charm of the game. ID Games did everything right in this game. PS: IF YOU CONSIDER BUYING THE DLC!!! Do it before you actually start the maincampaign. This dlc adds some new quests and locations and makes the game more complete. But you can do those quests as the campaign progresses, so buy it before you start playing the campaign.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One night I sat in my boxers in front of a gas heater whilst contemplating life and as I gently cupped my wrinkly nuts I thought, ""Let me write a review for a game"". The game is good, but not 41 hours+ good, yes I am ashamed of myself. Now, for the love of sweet baby jesus, why the Fnck oh wise one, why do thee rate it positive then? Well, I'll explain brutus. It looks nice, sound design is also good because the gun makes pewpewpew and that is fun, I guess. I swear to you I'm not fncking drunk. It's like wanting a zombie apocalypse to happen, thinking ""Fnck, surviving will be so exciting"", and then realising that you're basically just cowering inside a bunker until you starve to death. That's what this game is like but instead of hiding in a bunker like a coward you run and pewpew mutants...that's all, but the game does look really nice.Now there is racing, but just like the mutant pewpewpew'ing, you wroom wroom wroom with the 'WAS & D' keys.

												One night I sat in my boxers in front of a gas heater whilst contemplating life and as I gently cupped my wrinkly nuts I thought, ""Let me write a review for a game"". The game is good, but not 41 hours+ good, yes I am ashamed of myself. Now, for the love of sweet baby jesus, why the Fnck oh wise one, why do thee rate it positive then? Well, I'll explain brutus. It looks nice, sound design is also good because the gun makes pewpewpew and that is fun, I guess. I swear to you I'm not fncking drunk. It's like wanting a zombie apocalypse to happen, thinking ""Fnck, surviving will be so exciting"", and then realising that you're basically just cowering inside a bunker until you starve to death. That's what this game is like but instead of hiding in a bunker like a coward you run and pewpew mutants...that's all, but the game does look really nice.Now there is racing, but just like the mutant pewpewpew'ing, you wroom wroom wroom with the 'WAS & D' keys. You have a super boost wrOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOm when you press space which makes wrooming past other cars easier. My down syndrome kid can basically win these races with ease if his grandpa would stop bullying him but that's a story for another review.Ok, Mutant PewPewPew: CheckCar WroomWroomWroom: CheckOh...there's a built in card game, it's like Gwent (The Witcher 3) and Hearthstone (Blizzard) had a baby that recieved little to no oxygen at birth, so the parents (Gwent and Hearthstone) were forced to do a C-section, kind of thing.

												There are several reasons I stopped playing this game part of the way through the first level:1. Texture pop-ups. In case you haven't heard, they are incredibly egregious. They haven't fixed them since launch, and mods were only able to partially alleviate the problem for me- and I have a pretty powerful system.2. Gameplay was cookie-cutter whack-a-mole shooter. Enemy pops up, you shoot them. Sometimes they charge you, sometimes they stay in one place. Not very interesting.3. My gun was not fun to shoot, nor were my enemies fun to kill. The revolver feels like a peashooter, and my thoroughly unarmored, half-clothed enemies only seemed to emphasize the weapon's lack of power by dying only after being soaked in bullets. Some may say I should have stuck with the game, but I really couldn't find any redeeming quality in the early moments. With all the other options out there, it needs to do better to hold my attention. Thank Gaben for Steam refunds.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game thinking it would be good. It certainly didn't look bad on screens and reviews weren't that bad either.What a mistake this was.There's some kind of story that isn't that easy to follow as you are too busy being a good dog and fetching stuff for incompetent people who can't drive 500 meters to do it themselves.The graphics is okay, but definitely not good. While models look quite pretty and detailed, textures of the environment are blurry and very low-res. There's an option to turn details for textures on, but if you do, FPS goes WAY down and the change isn't even that remarkable.The sounds are standard. There's not much to say about them. There's also music that fits the atmosphere, but sadly isn't very memorable.When it comes to gameplay, the game takes some time to get used to. Enemies run around doing parkour stunts, so it's sometimes quite difficult to hit them (in the head). You can also drive vehicles and install weapons on them to be able to defend yourself from bandits who also own vehicles. Driving feels okay as long as you don't race. It's not like the racing is so bad, but AI drivers are masters of rally and you might have a hard time winning the first place. Races in the second part of the game are extremely frustrating.What kills this game are the minigames. They are mostly based on luck and even if they aren't, the game is ready to♥♥♥♥♥♥in your mouth anyway. It doesn't help that the game has achievements, which means more frustration for achievement hunters like myself as you MUST win all those unfair minigames. Did the lousy developers really think this was fun?To sum it up, this game is pretty much average. It's fine for people who don't go for 100% and avoid all the frustrating stuff the game has to offer. I personally was in rage several times, so at least the bloody title is fitting.EDIT: Finally did it. What were you thinking, idiots? Why so frustrating?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another in a long line of solid but shallow releases from id software.  This game has not been as revolutionary as id promoted, but the engine is legit, providing good visual quality, optimized and stable performance, and polished-smooth fps action.  Even the driving is fine.  But overall, like many id titles (post-Quake) the gameplay is shallow, streamlined, and simple.  The settlements in this game are filled with static npcs that might as well be statues, 95% of which you can't interact with.  They just spout a line of flavour dialogue as you walk past.  I beat the game last year but couldn't tell you anything particular about the plot.  Still, if you like post-apocalyptic shooters, this game may scratch that itch.  It doesn't have any of the inventory management minigames like the Borderlands series.  Rage probably won't hold your attention much beyond the initial playthrough, but if you like games of this type, it's probably worth $5 bucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's confusing, there's no clear path, everything is just over-wasted and over-textured, the bad guys are all nuts, the good guys are too nice and calm, and there's nothing to do for the first couple hours of just running errands before you can do races and get lost in some cities.  Just buy a racing game and a shooter separately so that you don't end up with a game that makes you work on one to get to the other.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Specially for 5€.Yes, there is the texture popping issue (resolved quickly) but it's not that bad for a 2011 game. Shooting is good and the AI decent, driving part can be repetitive but I've seen worse. Probably after these years with the patches and better hardware it's easier to enjoy RAGE.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Many reviews compare this game to Fallout or Borderlands. Personally I was extremely bored with both of those games but very entertained when playing Rage.  It has nice graphics, fun weapons (wingsticks, Crossbow, Nailgun), and ability to make Sentry Bots and Turrets to help you in large waves. The racing challenges are a great edition to the game where you can earn extra money for purchasing supplies or upgrading the vehicles. The Scorchers DLC adds a decent amout of extended game play along with  a second challenge of Bash TV :PHighly Recommended  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The shooting itself is fun and all (all ID games typically tend to deliver in this regard), but driving from location to location is a chore.  It's a game which at first feels open world, but really it's just a bunch of short linear quests which you get to by driving to each of them.  Again the driving controls suck in this game which is why I already gave up on Rage due to sheer frustration (or should I say rage lol).  And then as part of the story, they require you to ""race"" to move along in the story.  Screw that.C'mon ID.  No one is asking for linear corridor games with driving requirements.  If I wanted a driving game, I'd but a driving game.  You should do what you do best and just put together awesomely fun FPS games.  Or make driving optional and put a ""fast travel"" option to quickly get from place to place.  Or make driving fun like it is in Borderlands.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Refer to the Rage config customization guides online if you are having any performance or graphical issues. Have tested this game on a socket 775 Dual Core Celeron with Geforce 630GT 4GB, 4GB DDR2, managed to run at full graphical settings, hitting fps ranges of 35-60 fps. Looking forward to the sequel.

												Good game, i enjoyed it. It was alot of fun to play. But wait! There's More! Nope! Just Kidding! This game is so short on content that i completed it in 11 hours. Yep, granted i was playing on easy so it was not difficult, but what, the battles i played would have lasted an extra 15 minutes a peice, so thats 13 to 15 ""real"" hours of content in the game. Its extremely small. Its like a dumbed down version of Fallout, as in Wasteland with freeroam and quests and such. But its way too short. After you save the group of people thats going to win the game, ""Take the fight to the enemy!"" the game ends. Like thats it. Congrats, you started the revolution that will destroy the bad guys, but you dont get to take part in it. There are only two (2?!?!?!) real ""cities"" in the game. Two or three small towns and just 2 city like places which add up to the content of goodsprings and novac in the fallout series. So yeah, its fun, if you can get it for cheap get it. But dont expect to play it over and over again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a fun game.... if you like Elder Scrolls and Fallout games. It has the fun of Borderlands, but the difficulty of Fallout. I would give it 4.9/5. There are still some glitches with elevators, so save often. I would like a Rage 2, but they scrapped it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game, great shooter. Only downsides where that it felt too short and the modding tools is a bit heavy for most systems, also multiplayer was only limited to racing. Refer to the Rage config customization guides online if you are having any performance or graphical issues. Have tested this game on a socket 775 Dual Core Celeron with Geforce 630GT 4GB, 4GB DDR2, managed to run at full graphical settings, hitting fps ranges of 35-60 fps. Looking forward to the sequel.

												This game is not that bad, it`s actually maybe even better than Borderlands, i think. But still you can`t jump from anyplace like in Borderlands so that wasn`t cool at all. But it sure has some * Rage * in that game. You can`t pass that easly thru some bandits, you have to kill them all in order to pass out. Well yeah i have 1 hour of play and this game started to get serious at one mission that i`m on right now. The guns sure are really good, with optic is really easy to get a clean shot and kill someone, well at least for the pistol it was pretty smart to shoot while watching closer. So yeah it`s worth buying this game. I did brough it from other site cause it cost only around 3$. I defenetely recomend this game for playing. It`s worth it.Oh yeah, and the pretty fun part is - when they shoot you from distance with big guns that caused a lot of explotion i did fly a lot, fall down on rocks on low health, got down from them an died. But first my buggy was destroyed and i had to run while they were shooting at me, and then someone shoot me with a rocket launcher i think and i flied a lot. So yeah you got my point of view. xD Get high, fall down on rock, than jumped from them cause you have to get down on the land ofc, it wasn`t so high and yet i died because of low health. So close to get alive... >.<  c.c grr... anyway have fun with the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is a post-apocalyptic open world shooter with racing and minor RPG elements. It sounds like it has some great potential, but it fails in multiple key aspects to the point where I only find it worthy of a neutral score.The gameplay blends all of these genres and ideas together surprisingly well, but that does not mean it executes them well. There is a decently sized arsenal with several attachments, but the gunplay itself is mediocre at best with few differences between each weapon. Both assault rifles function very similarly. I should also mention that the attachments barely seem present with only half of the weapons having a single one.All weapons have special ammunition types but they are very poorly balanced. The pistol's ""fatboy"" rounds can down most heavy enemies in about 8 shots and can be used effectively for the entire game. On the other hand, mind control bolts for the crossbow are weak, expensive and near completely useless.There is very little variety in enemies. Most enemies just mindlessly charge your position with no care in the world and the few that don't just hide behind cover until you take them down. Even the boss type enemies tend to follow these patterns.The racing is unable to save the poor aspects of the gunplay. Steering is astoundingly bad, there are few different tracks for racing and rally is just not fun at all.Crafting has some interesting components and items that can give you the tactical advtange. However, it is extremely underwhelming with few items to craft and little emphasis on it. I played through most of this game crafting almost nothing but bandages. The atmosphere isn't post-apocalypticy enough. The enviroment makes me feel like I'm in the middle of a desert or a canyon. The atmosphere is especially weak in the eastern wasteland. The soundtrack is also pretty bad.I want to point out that the end-game is extremely dissapointing and easy with the end itself being very weak. The mutant bash levels are more difficult than the ending and that's saying a lot.I would give this game a 5/10. With about 10 hour long playthroughs (probably 15-20 hours if you are a completionist), decent replayabillity and sometimes fun gameplay. But all of the flaws balance out with these good things creating a very neutral game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Just buy a racing game and a shooter separately so that you don't end up with a game that makes you work on one to get to the other.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definately not worth its price!I will tell you why.Rage is an FPS game set in an post apocalyptic and vast land. You are some guy striving through the lands, while surprisingly a mutant attacks you, another guy comes in and saves you. After that you will probably think ""Oh this is quite big open world"", well ♥♥♥♥ that. You have atleast some open world, which you will only see from your vehicle, because everything else is absolutely nonsense (You'll probably die, atleast in Ultra Nightmare, but i can't tell about the other difficulties). Once you accept a quest (you have to in order progress in the campaign) your destination is set and you move yourself in front of a dungeon-like entrance (no, seriously there is an entrance for every quest). Later in the game some scripted events in certain places will delay your arrival at your destination, if you are not cautious From that point on even Call of Duty is more open world than this game (also applies to each single level). The game also tells you to play a level again, in reverse. That happened to me once or twice i don't really remember, nevertheless it is definately too often in my opinion.To be honest, the animations are really good. Although they repeat themselves (no-few variety) as you can imagine. The graphics load themselves as you move on, none of them are preloaded so prepare yourself to see some washy/blurry textures if you really want to buy it.I spent about 7 hours and i was about half-way through, then i apparently ""RAGE quitted"", because i could hold on to see the lack of variety in this game.I hope my review on this game will keep your hands from RAGE.

I forgot about this game and it was brought up in a recent discussion. I was asked if I thought this game was worthwhile.There is a clear answer for that, absolutely no.I loved how this game felt, how combat handled and alot about this game just clicked. However, I took my time with the game and still completed it in such a short time that its just silly...and the story was awful. I don't remember the story actually. I do remember my utter and complete shock when I stumbled upon the ending tho. I was literally taken by surprise and had no idea it was right around the corner. My girlfriend still remembers me swearing up a storm over what a waste of money this game was when that ending came out of no where.It's very seldom that I would say a single thing can ruin a game,..Cons: Game lengthPros: Almost everything else. It has great graghics, near perfect performance, combat feels right, and I enjoyed playing and interacting with the world. This probally only contributed to the great slap in the face when it all ended.*For anyone looking at my time played on this game... keep in mind there were 3 savefiles ran thru the game*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awful.  It's confusing, there's no clear path, everything is just over-wasted and over-textured, the bad guys are all nuts, the good guys are too nice and calm, and there's nothing to do for the first couple hours of just running errands before you can do races and get lost in some cities.  Just buy a racing game and a shooter separately so that you don't end up with a game that makes you work on one to get to the other.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Single Player Campaign Review ONLY.RAGE is flat-out an awesome shooter, even despite its numerous problems on the PC version. There are numerous problems here: it's not the best technically running game; texture quality is all over the place; recycled areas (often on side quests); no real end-game boss; and a very abrupt & horrible ending. The game has lots of charm and atmosphere; it's somehow one of Id's better stories (if that's saying much); the voice-acting is excellent; and the combat and some weapons - i.e. RB bomb cars & mind Control Darts - are awesome.Even after all of its issues, RAGE is still a pretty good shooter. It's just that RAGE could've been greater than what it is, if only Id would fix the numerous issues & actually finish the story. With the game still shining even amidst all these problems, that's saying A LOT and speaks volumes about this game.SP Campaign -- Grade: B-If I touch the Multiplayer, I will re-review this game & include that in there...

												Definately not worth its price!I will tell you why.Rage is an FPS game set in an post apocalyptic and vast land. You are some guy striving through the lands, while surprisingly a mutant attacks you, another guy comes in and saves you. After that you will probably think ""Oh this is quite big open world"", well ♥♥♥♥ that. You have atleast some open world, which you will only see from your vehicle, because everything else is absolutely nonsense (You'll probably die, atleast in Ultra Nightmare, but i can't tell about the other difficulties). Once you accept a quest (you have to in order progress in the campaign) your destination is set and you move yourself in front of a dungeon-like entrance (no, seriously there is an entrance for every quest). Later in the game some scripted events in certain places will delay your arrival at your destination, if you are not cautious From that point on even Call of Duty is more open world than this game (also applies to each single level). The game also tells you to play a level again, in reverse. That happened to me once or twice i don't really remember, nevertheless it is definately too often in my opinion.To be honest, the animations are really good. Although they repeat themselves (no-few variety) as you can imagine. The graphics load themselves as you move on, none of them are preloaded so prepare yourself to see some washy/blurry textures if you really want to buy it.I spent about 7 hours and i was about half-way through, then i apparently ""RAGE quitted"", because i could hold on to see the lack of variety in this game.I hope my review on this game will keep your hands from RAGE.

												It's a boring shallow experience. It's just a trek through a boring wasteland with hardly any memorable characters.People praise the graphics for being incredibly well done, which I will agree in some parts it's a beautiful game... However... in some places they were just lazy. Incredibly lazy. Things like vending machines were nothing but flat textures. And this is an item they expect you to interact with. It just brings an insanely bad contrast with really good looking textures and god awful ones that break imersion.The checkpoint, or autosave system is garbage. It's seriously the worst thing ever concieved by a developer, and all it does is bring attention to the terrible menu system. Seriously let me control with both mouse and keyboard. I don't understand why that would be so difficult to do. Let me use esc to exit from in game menu's. Every other game in existence does that already, but apparently it was too difficult for them to do that.The intro was slow and boring, which just really shows how terrible their pacing in this game is.The pacing in this game is just garbage. You are spending half your time walking or driving in a wasteland, or walking to an area to get a mission, only for that mission to have you go back to where you were before. This happened 4 times in the beginning of the game within 5 minutes. It's forced backtracking, and since there is absolutely nothing in between it's just boring.No enemy respawns. Seriously what the hell is up with this? It just makes exploring old areas boring, and basically pointless. As there is no extra loot.Almost every gang was the same. They fought the same (minus a bit of flipping), and used pretty much the same weapons.I haven't beaten the game yet, but when I do I will update the review to cover what I thought of that... if I can even bring myself to finish it.Edit: After about 4 hours into the game, it has picked up a bit. It's still slow and boring for the most part, but there are at least a few entertaining things. Also why does every single character feel like telling me their damn life story every time I talk to them. Since the only way to skip it is to walk away and come back, it's just a huge annoyance.

												This game was met with mixed reviews on release, while I can accept some of the criticisms about this title I think it has been unjustly referred to as a mediocre game and I feel that if you are an FPS fan then this really is 100% worth playing.This is an FPS game set in a post-apocalyptic world, it has limited looting, crafting and RPG elements but it is at it's heart a shooter and a vehicle combat game. I personally would recommend playing this game on a pad, as it's not a competitive FPS title. The game was definitely designed with a pad in mind and the interface is much easier to use (switching quick use items for example). Not to mention driving the vehicles!Graphically I think the game excels, the landscapes are superb as is the detail and you can tell a lot of thought has gone into the level design. The characters are well done, although many of the unimportant NPC's have similar features. The negatives I can say about the graphics though is some texture 'pop in' from time to time. On the whole this is not a problem and doesn't detract, the one point at which I would say it was noticeable to the point of distracting was in the level 'dead city'.The sound on the whole is well done, the weapon and engine noises are very good. The voice acting on the whole is also good although they have clearly used the same actor for multiple NPC's. What I would say though is it is quite annoying that you yourself do not speak, it ruins the immersion a little bit as this game is really supposed to a bit of an RPG lite. Also the most annoying sound quirk is when driving in game, quite often a change of speed or action appears to cause the engine sound to cut out. This is very poor and it did annoy me quite a bit.The gameplay was enjoyable, it is a classic ID shooter really. Although it has open world sections most of the fighting is really done in well-designed levels and set pieces. The enemy character movements are top notch and they jump and dodge your fire, heading for cover and shooting from behind obstacles. Although within the gameplay is my biggest gripe about this game, when enemy character enters an animation when hit in a certain place. i.e. they fall to the ground injured. You can quite often rain a hail of bullets into them and they somehow seem to resist significantly more damage than they would ordinarily while in this state. This really did get on my nerves and was one of the reasons when I first starting playing this I was a little put off.If you can look past this games few flaws and appreciate the love that appears to have been poured into creating this game then there is a solid 30-40 hours of very enjoyable gameplay and some really fantastic graphics. Even by today’s standards. Also the achievements are quite straight forward and rewarding to play towards giving the game a bit of extra replayability. I would highly recommend this game to any FPS fan, it really is a must play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love sci-fi, and the cyberpunk look of this game is outstanding!  For me, this is such a great game I have to place it a solid third behind the Mass Effect series and the first two Bioshock games.  Killer graphics, perfect game play, great music, interesting characters and acting, decent story, effective and varied weapons, and good overall play time - pretty near a perfect combo, for me.  Coming back to this game after a few years I'm kind of shocked at how well the graphics in this game have held up!  Add some exciting and intelligent racing (if you want), and anytime saving and health regen, and you have one of the all-time greats!  The ending is a little lackluster, but I can't judge a 30+ hour game experience on a less than perfect ending.  Highly recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage puts you in a wasteland, full of twisted minds, and mutations. The game is not emotional, it does not have the greatest writing, and it is pretty much a Racing/Slaughterfest hybrid. And I love it. The game is linear, yet not so linear that you feel bored. It does have sidequests, and collectibles, that you can pick up along the way. This makes for a great game for those, who seeks the 100% Completion.There is lots of killing, and explosions, infact, they could most likely ship it as a Micheal Bay movie, however, it doesn't get tiresome. However, there is some flaws with Rage, and first and formost, the textures. The textures, which look awful, and many have considered this a core issue of the game. I also dislike the gambling part of the game, because, you rarely lose money, and more often than not, the money you get from simply gambling for ten minutes, can often throw you far ahead in weapon and veichle upgrades, that the game gets easy.I highly recommend this game, if you want to have a fun singleplayer game, however, you shouldn't expect any masterpiece. 7.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Моя оценка этой игры 8 из 10.Игра мне понравилась неплохой графикой,наличием разных мини-игр,и вооружением(для каждого оружия 4 типа патрон на ваш вкус буть-то скажем динамитные и электрострелы или же для любителей стелса просто стальные наконечники или стрелы контроля разума к примеру)геймплей в 18-20 часов если доп.задания выполнять в принципе не надоедает как и перестрелки с врагами  при этом можно использовать различные средства к примеру(машины мины,турели,роботы,бумеранги срубающие врагам бошки)и всё это можно сделать самому как и особые патроны и медикаменты но тем не менее сюжет довольно схож с  фалаутом 3( то же от  этих же создателей бифездэй)и концовка то ли отсылка на следующюю часть то ли просто создатели решили над ней не слишком  напрягаться. Ну в общем  я советую вам поиграть в эту игру если вам понравился фалаут3(или 1 и 2)  или вы просто любитель постапокала но если вы в целом ненавидите творчество бифесдэй то можете ненадеятся что этот проект обелит их в ваших глазах.

												Rage is what you feel while trying to get the game to run reliably and stable. It would be a pretty decent game if the framerate didn't flop to sub 30fps regardlesss of the settings. Streaming textures from the HDD like they did was in fact one of the dumbest things they could have done for real world performance.What were they thinking? You turn to your right and the textures just pop in like crazy.If you an an AMD GPU your essentially boned from all that I have read.The acutal game part dousn't seem that great, run of the mill shooter but in an interesting local. UI design and UI visuals are ♥♥♥♥ing nice and crisp though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game had a lot of potential and fell short. You get about 25% of the way through and the game starts repeating. The dungeons have the same enemies in the same places. There are only so many weapons. It all gets pretty repetative. And, even with that, the game isn't all that long overall. Half of the game is racing your car in combat arenas, sort of Twisted Metal style.The graphics look great. Some of the better character models I've seen recently. I would say pick this game up on a $5 sale if you're looking for a single player to complete on the side.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, this is a pretty fun game, but I probably wouldn't have bought it if it wasn't in a Steam Sale. It's pretty reminiscent of Borderlands; hell, even one of the towns looks like it was lifted right from Pandora. I had fun playing it but, it was really lacking in two things: a story, and a freaking resolution.The whole time I was playing I kept thinking to myself ""okay, I'm going to find out more about why I'm randomly just teaming up with people hundreds of years in the future"" and ""I'm totally going to meet that crazy Ark survivor everyone's talking about and duke it out!"" WRONG.You have no context. You're literally a robot following orders for no reason. Why would you have any incentive to do anything? YOU DON'T. The player character has no name, no place to call home, and no friends. He has zero incentive to help anybody, and no one even bothers to ask what he wants to do, if he's confused, or even give him a moment to realize he's IN THE FUTURE. And as for the no resolution? Well, there's no conclusion to the story. IT JUST ENDS. Right when you think you're at the halfway point, BAM!!! Game's over!!!! I don't even care if there's DLC to continue the story, that's horrible game design right there.All in all if you want to shoot people in the face with neat guns and pay a crap tonne of money to keep well stocked, or if you just didn't get enough Borderlands, play RAGE. >: (			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While it lasted I enjoyed RAGE.It was over to quickly though - even with The Scorchers DLC there just wasn't enough of the game.More could've been made of the wasteland areas, sure it fun to drive around but in the end the areas were quite small. The same problem also occurs with the various areas you visit - I wanted more of the Dead City, a lot more. While it was fun to revisit areas just going through them in reverse let me feeling that id cheaped out.Don't get me wrong it was a fun game to play and, provided you pick it up cheap, I would recommend the game. Just don't be surprised when you complete the game and think ""was that it""!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a horrible game. When I first tried to play it, it was mired in horrible graphics bugs. After those were fixed, I picked the game up again. It doesn't take long to complete but the ending proved that everything you did to get to the end was a collossal waste of time. I would preface this with a proper spoiler alert, but you can't spoil something that didn't even happen. The game doesn't have a proper ending. You fight a few waves of weak enemies and then you're treated to a five second cutscene. That's it. Nothing else happens. You don't have a showdown with the ultimately faceless antagonist. You don't really see the fruits of your labour. The game. just. ends. I felt cheated.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm writing this review for one reason only: the bad rap that some have given this game is wholly undeserved. If you like fast action shooters (with a fair amount of pulse pounding racing - something I struggled with at times), then you don't want to miss this action shooter. It's got great guns and weapons, which actually can be modified to increase their power. The simple pistol you start out with can be turned into one nasty killing weapon with the right parts and money. You have all types of guns (the modded shotgun is awesome), and even a deadly crossbow. Money is hard to come by, but it is available. Sell as much as you can to the traders to use on upgrades. Sure, the plot is a bit thin, this isn't Skyrim or a plot-centric game, although it does have a plot. The enemies are at times relentless, so never stand still. Keep moving, shooting, use cover when you can. the Sniper rifle is awesome. My only complaints are the two of the BOSS fights are ridiculously hard (might need to cheat on one of them, but that's possible, google it). Single player only for me, but tons of enjoyment, never a dull moment. The car racing is very hard using just a keyboard and mouse, I have the feeling this was a console port that used controllers  but if you persist and really push the pedal to the metal, eventually you can win enough to pimp your ride to badass fighting machine. I loved this game for just one reason - it's just freaking FUN, something so many games today seem to forget. It should be fun. Fun, fun, fun and gets the blood pumping. I hate that I have to delete it (there is still more to do, but I've completed most of the game and I need the disk space for Wasteland 2! :)9.5/10 for fun. (what better reason than to play a game?)8/10 graphics6/10 racing9/10 action and excitment. 9/10 for weapons and nice rpg-like elements like upgrading weaponsOverall, I cannot give this less than 8.5/10. Get the scorchers DLC and it's 9/10. This game is so underrated and under appreciated it sucks, but if you like what you read above, get this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is a first person actin shooter set in a post apocalyptic earth. The shooter mecanics are good even though the pistol seems a bit inacurate at times. All guns fits in to the game setting and have their place. There are a veichal part of the game wich is welll executed and pretty fun to play. You have to race to upgrade your cars. I found that fine even if i at times would have wanted to be able to buy uppgrades with cash.The story is good and you are introduced to the game world at a good pace. I have heard differing oppinion about the later part of the story and the end of the game. I feel the end was a bit weak but it did not affect my oppinion of the game that much (might be that i did not have that high expectations of the ending).Rage is not a hard game if you are used to shooters (FPS). I played it on normal and on the hardest dificulty and even if it was harder it was not to dificult.I recomend the game. It is fun and a good shooter with a strong story (exept maby the end).It is also good if you want a post appcalyptic setting without the zombies that are flooding the games these days./K4tch			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rage is an excellent first person shooter. The graphics are great - especially on my pc spec - they look well lush. The wasteland scenery is immersive; the game-play is great, with a good interesting story. This game IMO has many fun elements to keep one playing it: The shooting mechanics in this game are superb, and very well balanced IMO, all the guns look and sound great, and killing with the special ammo adds a whole new creative dynamic to game-play. I was always being surprised by the many ways I could use them to kill enemies in certain situations,  The crafting engineering system is good to use, it's well balanced and not too deep when creating special items. The vehicles are fast and fun to drive while travelling the huge open wastelands, much needed when getting around from place to place. I really enjoyed the wide open atmospheric wastelands; they were always encouraging me to explore new areas of interest.In a nutshell: I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good graphics and moderately good gameplay. the bland story, setting, and characters bring this game down. Odd control scheme too; I found myself too slow because of manu navigation. It took a while to get used to it.RECCOMMEND?: Not particularly. If you can find it for super cheap, it may be worth it at that point.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Reminded me alot of ID Soft's older titles Doom and Quake for the atmosphere of the game.  I was surprised, as I expected the gameplay to be the same as well.  Instead they have made this world based around a storyline and quests, as well as sideline quests to keep you entertained, as well as giving you a chance to slow things down for a while in town buying supplies and doing events such as racing.  The vehicle battles were a nice change as well, to add to the game.  Highly recommend.  And will be buying the DLC when it is on sale again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Моя оценка этой игры 8 из 10.Игра мне понравилась неплохой графикой,наличием разных мини-игр,и вооружением(для каждого оружия 4 типа патрон на ваш вкус буть-то скажем динамитные и электрострелы или же для любителей стелса просто стальные наконечники или стрелы контроля разума к примеру)геймплей в 18-20 часов если доп.задания выполнять в принципе не надоедает как и перестрелки с врагами  при этом можно использовать различные средства к примеру(машины мины,турели,роботы,бумеранги срубающие врагам бошки)и всё это можно сделать самому как и особые патроны и медикаменты но тем не менее сюжет довольно схож с  фалаутом 3( то же от  этих же создателей бифездэй)и концовка то ли отсылка на следующюю часть то ли просто создатели решили над ней не слишком  напрягаться. Ну в общем  я советую вам поиграть в эту игру если вам понравился фалаут3(или 1 и 2)  или вы просто любитель постапокала но если вы в целом ненавидите творчество бифесдэй то можете ненадеятся что этот проект обелит их в ваших глазах.

												Playing 64 bit version even though no achievements cause it works better on my PC. Great game. Works excellent at 21:9. Sat on this for a long time cause when I first got it had all kinds of texture issues. Set it aside for the day that it was fixed. After getting new monitor and looking for cool stuff to try on it, decided to see how this was doing. Noticed 64 bit version. Tried normal one first. Same kinds of problems as before. Just terrible texture pop-in. 64 bit version is perfect for me. No achievements is a bummer, but the regular one just plays poorly in comparison.Great game. Love the combat. Look forward to encounters. Playing one notch above standard difficult. Good xbox controller support. I prefer gamepad now for these games at least when playing campaigns as I consider it a more realistic challenge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not very good, not very fun. Small open world with nothing to do and no reason to spend any time there. Levels are reused multiple times, and there are only a handful of them and they are the definition of linear. 70% of combat is just fighting off waves of enemies while locked in small areas, the other 30% is a corridor shooter with bullet sponge enemies. Invisible walls EVERYWHERE. It runs like garbage for what it is. Tons of audio glitches. Some textures, specifically environmental ones, look beautiful from far away, but terrible once you get close. The game as a whole seems poorly thought out and the story and missions rushed and incomplete.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its been a long time coming but today i finally finished this bloody game.I bought it a few weeks after launch, but it hasn't taken me this long to beat it because its difficult or long, its just.. a frustratingly beautiful game.I think i uninstalled / installed this game 4 or 5 times. Its 20 bloody gigs and there were times when i needed the space and felt the game just wasn't worth playing any more. Being a huge fan of Doom and most of i.d's games, i forced myself to give it another crack.I'll say it again. This game is frustrating. Not due to difficulty, but because of how often you will ask ""what were they thinking?!"".There is just far too much back tracking across the landscape for running pathetic errands. I was turned off immediately by how quickly your pulled into a conflict rather than a slow build up. Within 5 minites of the first guy saving your life after you step out of the life pod, he's asking you to go to a bandit camp and wipe them all out. Sorry, but the player JUST woke up from some kind of hyper sleep pod thing 5 minutes ago and 100 years has passed. He should be walked through the game and given some warm up missions and shown what kind of word he has woken up into.A big problem that will hit PC games early, is how much this game feels like its on rails. Lets not beat around the bush. This is a console game, designed for boys with game pads. You don't have any freedom to go where you want. See a hand rail thats only knee high and want to jump over? Nope. Invisible wall. Want to jump onto that rock? Nope, invisible wall. See all that cool environment around you that you want to explore every inch of to find hidden stuff? Nope, its all blocked off by invisible walls.To be fair, this is probably i.d's finest work. Its the best attempt at a story yet and the art is simply amazing. The Jackel Canyon level has got to be one of the most visually stunning game environments i've ever seen. The megatexture tech making every rock wall of this level look unique and truly beautiful. The final level, for all its failures, is still an incredibly detailed level that few games can compete with for detail. Including Crysis 3. That is until you get up close and everything looks as if its made from poor quality printed photos on paper. Its grainy and blurry and possibly some of the most heartbreakingly awful compression thats ever happened to a games textures. Those poor artists!Surely they must've all played the game and thought to themselves ""wow, all our lovel art looks terrible now, we should really release a different version for the PC on Bluray with uncompressed textures"", right? No. This is where the problem of a developer being at the mercy of a publisher rears its ugly head. The publisher pushes them to release on all platforms at once to maximize sales and keep the consumers happy. The days of releasing a top quality ground breaking game for PC, then scaling it back for console gamers is over (ahem crytek..). Plus, no one wants to deal with complaints from hoardes of twelve year olds that the PC version looks amzing, yet on their console it looks like its viewed from the eyes of an 18 year old fox terrier with glaucoma.If you have not yet played Borderlands, wait till you've played Rage. Otherwise you'll spend way too much time cringing at just how ""on rails"" this game is. Play Borderlands afterwards, and see what potential Rage had.The combat is ace and the art and animations are first class, but the scale is let down by limited freedom to explore and a weak vehicle element.Sure its an enjoyable shooter and i'll recommend it simply for the combat, but only if you pick it up from a bargain bin for $5.

												Behold, fetch quest, the game.Might change my mind after i play it more.Edit: Nope. Opinion not changed at all.Its still fetch quest and ""Go here, talk to ths guy. Accept his quest. Do it. Go back to the quest giver, get reward, go to other guy.""You're basically everyones post apocolyptic errand boy. The funniest part is that you just woke up from cryo sleep or something not an hour ago and people are already making you drive around like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mailman. One guy STILL owes me an armor suit that he said he'd give me, but never did, nor did he tell me where to find it.There is one thing i will praise and one thing only. I like how the friendly NPC's seem bizarrely cheery. Its almost surreal given the environment. With mutants (That dissolve on death for some reason) and angry psychopaths everywhere. Its like they're all on ecstasy.Ok another thing, the animation is spectacular. NPC movement is fluid and natural.Now onto the rest.The gunplay is average and thats whats wrong with it. Theres nothng particularly fun about it, its just pointing metal things at soft things and pushing a button until the soft thing stops moving. This is the basic formula of most FPS games and theres nothing wrong with it. But somehow in this game its just monotonous and not entertaining in any way.Ok i have this one somewhat odd gripe, the ragdolls. They're abysmal. They make the skyrim ragdolls look like they have actual human joints instead of being broken animatronic dolls. They're so stiff its just not fun to watch them fly around. It also gives them this bizarre twitch when they transition from fluid animation to unreasonably stiff physics. Which is a shame because the death animations are spectacular. They also twitch oddly when you loot them. And sometimes get  partially stuck in the ground.The graphics, They're ok. Average. They don't stand out as being good or bad, they're just ok. Skyboxes are awesome, but since the maps are basically linear hallways with little room to explore, the graphics engine never gets a chance to shine.The maps. As i said above, i haven't played much. I also said that the maps are basically glorified straight lines. And linearity is ok if the gameplay is fun and the story is interesting. But since RAGE has neither of that. Its just really dull. Again, the engine seems perfect for rendering massive expansive worlds. But i have yet to see even a medium field in this game.The story. All i've really got is that a big rock hit the earth and almost everything died. Thats about it. Because now all i'm doing is running between two clans of hicks fetching things for them so they can continue to stand around doing nothing.Sound. Nothing special. The voice actors atleast sound like they're into it. But haven't really noticed anything unique.In short. This is what you get if you stick fallout and borderlands in a blender and set it to ""Boring"".3/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

MASSIVE loading times for every zone transition you'll be making every twenty minutes, and an ending that comes VERY quickly and out of nowhere.It's not terrible, but it's not great. It's very run-of-the-mill, nothing special. Only worth purchasing at low sale price and if you're bored.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At its present asking price of approximately twenty clams - this is a great game... It is as advertised a First Person Shooter and you have specific missions and tasks that are handed to you in interesting ways. You'll likely be able to set your PC to full video settings and blast away - although it is a fine looking game, I think it's nicer than METRO REDUX in its appearance and playability - and they are both corridore (path) shooters... Rage was more fun in my opinion and less pretentious. This game does not take itself too seriously and that is a PLUS. The Card games are fun and worthy of mastering / The car races are fun and make for interesting vehicle upgrades - the missions are almost always cool looking and intense... I give this shooter a HIGH SCORE at twenty bucks			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not really a bad game, but coming from ID, it kind of disappointed me. Yes, I am aware that its also Bethesda now, but that might just be the problem. The mechanics are fair, the enemies are pretty interesting, and the textures are nice, along with the weapons in my opinion. However, the weapons are more typical of the more common first person shooter. Having devastating ammo types was a good move, but I believe that the weapons in general should be lootable from various enemies. The other issue is that this is a pretty bad port for a beloved studio such as ID. All in all, it's worth the current price, but don't expect to much out of this game. I have noticed that people have bashed this game for ripping off borderlands. That is actually false, as this game was in development before borderlands, even if it came out last. You can thank 2k for their brilliant rip-off known as borderlands. This game does borrow a lot from fallout, which is only excusable if you count the fact that both this game and fallout 3 through 4 were made by Bethesda.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing and it is very fun. It does have the graphics issues and it is rather short. I completed the game first time round in nightmare within 19 hours. They should of done this as an open world as once you finish it you cannot go back and do the stuff you missed. Really good FPS and RPG aswell.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having a blast with this game, finally getting around to it in late 2015.Update: Finished the game finally.  I'm going to keep things generic to avoid spoilers.It's a light shooter with great atmosphere and (mostly optional) racing elements.The first (larger) half of the game is in an awesome Mad Max desert kind of world.The game then moves to a different (maybe a bit shorter) area and gets more cyber-punk blade-runner.This game alows going between the two areas but does have ""can't go back for it"" elements within specific dungeons.  Mostly finding cards for the minigame and hidden areas (which usually require a couple lock grinders handy at all times), but occasionally a weapon-based achievement is much easier at a very specific point in a dungeon.The ending is a let-down.  The closest thing to a spoiler is that...... there's no boss fight.The multiplayer community is non-existent.  Let me know if you get this game and want to play it, I'd love to get some multiplayer achievements!Verdict: $10, play it casually like a movie.  Good for ""between"" epic games when you need a break.Get the DLC if you liked the first area of the game.  It's even lighter with a very stereotypical ""babe"" added.  It adds itself automatically as a quest you can complete during the original game (actually the DLC lets you continue after the ending as well).  Just go back to the original Wasteland area and it will have a quest marker.  It does have a boss fight but is really more of the same.  If you're looking for story or depth forget it.

												Its a shame rage wasn't more popular, I REALLY enjoyed playing it through, even though it has its problems, I recommend anyone do the same, there is a good game here waiting to be played.Good things :   -Clearly a good game engine		-Game feels nice and a pleasure to play		-The game design and therefore the end product seems much better than it initially seems		-You are not drowned in possibilities of this open world which seems like your going back and forth for no                     reason...  Bad things :  -Can feel quite Linear at times	             -Difficulty because of gamedesign is Abysmal  - this is not a diffcult or chllenging gmae in any form! RAGE is very shallow on the exteria, but if you give it the time, it does introduce a very wide variety of fairly intersting, (though most are not ground breaking) dynamics and makes them work quite well(which is what is so good), it is not the sort of game that strikes you as being elegant that much at all. But trust me it has has plenty of decent stuff to keep you busy and not keep you running around for hours doing nothing and getting bored.  Combat is good enough, shooting  and conquering is nice on Rage, in the usual ID way (Doom, Quake etc), but from the start the variation of weapons feels like it could be better(irronically in the ID way :P), as most are similar to any other game, though, I would suggest that all players endure this , until you get the full load of weapons and multiple ammo types which much more liberty with tactics and stratgy in combat; even with your seemingly standard load-out.Whats more becuase there is a simple crafting system , it extends the weapons further and even accessories like sentry bots, whcih is pretty cool.Its clear it trys to be Borderlands and emulates the environment, but the story is actually better than Borderlands and so is the game(or at least I prefer this).  In saying that I never really liked borderlands that much... I would play this over BL any day... The story was good, and infact the usual 'you are a special kind of soldier type' in ID games is apparent on this game too, though the different kind of Post-Apocalypse scenario is quite intersting when you think about it. The main forte of the gmae is an impressive engine via ID, which makes shooting, racing and exploring a really nice experience.  It looks nice, it feels nice in all aspects.Because of this engine, the racing/driving  doesn't look shoddy(like Borderlands) and feels ok.  There was an issue at the start of the game with the handbreak that is not balanced with the first vehicles, but trust me when I say that it improves when you get your 3rd vehicle(you may have to upgrade it).  You can adapt to using the hand break in some capacity on the 2nd vehicle though...  Racing, though I am not really fussed about racing games, is not too bad, I enjoyed it.  There is plenty of variation in racing matches, from standard racing matches to the sequential  'Domination' matches(the first to get to a check point get points, the first to 40 points wins(Blowing others up gives you points too...) which does throw the strategy to race on its head(which I think is quite good).The Music is fine, parts of it sounds un-natural to me, and some of the style of both the composer and the music suck, *To me*.  But in saying that, its not too bad and the music is good when you are playing through the game, and can actually be quite good in parts.I will add the worst thing about this game was the difficulty.  This game is SSOOoo easy!  If you are bad at FPS: PLAY RAGE!  You have at least 2 lives and you heal constantly, so unless you keep passing out on the keyboard, you will be fine!  I played this on Hard and found it not much of a challenge at all and perhaps after some days that was nice, but I want a challenge from any game I play and Believe me , RAGE isn't challeging in the slightest!  I am keen to play through in nightmare mode , just to see if they actually have ANY challenging difficulty modes at all!Word of advice:If you are buying this on steam, Dont play on 64bit mode unless you have to:i.e. this mode:		* Rage 64bit(not supported) for mods*When you start up the game.  If you want to stick in the hours to finish the campaign and you want to play to get achievements, dont play on 64bit mode, also 64 bit mode takes a LONG time to load an area, and its not like 2x the time, but more like 50x.. literally my computer takes 5minutes just to load town or the wasteland from any loacation... In standard 32 bit mode, it takes about 10 seconds... So avoid 64bit mode unlesss you really want to use it!  I got half way through the game before realising achievements were not logged and had to start again on the 32bit mode ( you cant access 64bit data in 32 bit game!) .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WINGSTICKS! buy right away, because these things are more deadly that bullets in this game. i really enjoyed my time with RAGE. you'll see the most beautiful sky dome in anygame.. then look at the most ugly plant in any game ever. for the most part this game looks amazing and plays well. The Scorchers DLC is worth trying out. adds a little extra to the game which in itself is rather short. and to quote my lovely & adoreable Steam friend ""did the ending make you RAAAGE?!?"" i know they're very funny lol, but no. i enjoyed the experience. the story was alright.caveat emptor (buyer beware): this game does not play nice with anything other than Nvidia cards (cards with CUDA). also, look to buy the retail copy (physical media) of the game, the special Anarchy Edition. it comes with some unique DLC which you can’t purchase on Steam.turn on smart v-sync & GPU transcode in the options menu in gamecreate a cache folder in this location name/AppData/Local (Windows start menu, ""%temp%"" click entre and work backwards)  “id software” go into it and create a second folder called “rage” (all in lower case) and once you start the game again it’ll create cache files to reduce stutter and texture pop.in the""base"" folder where your copy of RAGE is installed. copy the .cfg file and rename it to rageconfig.cfg if you don’t already have one. open with notepad and delete all the text. write “+cvaradd g_fov 10” which adds +10 to the base field of view. *optional lines to add*com_videoRam 2048fc_maxcachememoryMB 2048vt_useCudaTranscode 0vt_maxPPF 128vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly2 8192vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly 8192vt_pageimagesizeunique 8192vt_pageimagesizevmtr 8192vt_restartvt_maxaniso 4image_anisotropy 4			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ID Software at it's finest!This game runs on the polished and refined ID Tech 5 engine that was brilliantly engineered by John Carmak. The game uses a beautiful new texture rendering system that gives the game a beautiful look to it that is unmatched by most games. Gameplay wise, the game has such a wide variety of things to do! It's a perfect FPS game with unbelievably incredible AI, interacting with the environment making sure that each battle is something new as well as an undefined RPG system to accompany the game. Sure, it's pretty linear compared to other RPG titles such as Fallout and S.T.A.L.K.E.R, but the game still offers an extremely large amount of exploration and side quests to complete. The game is also followed up with a nice racing addition with intense races and awesome vehicle combat. RAGE is definitely one of the best shooters I've played this year and should be checked out by anyone who appreciates the FPS genre with a little twist to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not very good, not very fun. Small open world with nothing to do and no reason to spend any time there. Levels are reused multiple times, and there are only a handful of them and they are the definition of linear. 70% of combat is just fighting off waves of enemies while locked in small areas, the other 30% is a corridor shooter with bullet sponge enemies. Invisible walls EVERYWHERE. It runs like garbage for what it is. Tons of audio glitches. Some textures, specifically environmental ones, look beautiful from far away, but terrible once you get close. The game as a whole seems poorly thought out and the story and missions rushed and incomplete.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Behold, fetch quest, the game.Might change my mind after i play it more.Edit: Nope. Opinion not changed at all.Its still fetch quest and ""Go here, talk to ths guy. Accept his quest. Do it. Go back to the quest giver, get reward, go to other guy.""You're basically everyones post apocolyptic errand boy. The funniest part is that you just woke up from cryo sleep or something not an hour ago and people are already making you drive around like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mailman. One guy STILL owes me an armor suit that he said he'd give me, but never did, nor did he tell me where to find it.There is one thing i will praise and one thing only. I like how the friendly NPC's seem bizarrely cheery. Its almost surreal given the environment. With mutants (That dissolve on death for some reason) and angry psychopaths everywhere. Its like they're all on ecstasy.Ok another thing, the animation is spectacular. NPC movement is fluid and natural.Now onto the rest.The gunplay is average and thats whats wrong with it. Theres nothng particularly fun about it, its just pointing metal things at soft things and pushing a button until the soft thing stops moving. This is the basic formula of most FPS games and theres nothing wrong with it. But somehow in this game its just monotonous and not entertaining in any way.Ok i have this one somewhat odd gripe, the ragdolls. They're abysmal. They make the skyrim ragdolls look like they have actual human joints instead of being broken animatronic dolls. They're so stiff its just not fun to watch them fly around. It also gives them this bizarre twitch when they transition from fluid animation to unreasonably stiff physics. Which is a shame because the death animations are spectacular. They also twitch oddly when you loot them. And sometimes get  partially stuck in the ground.The graphics, They're ok. Average. They don't stand out as being good or bad, they're just ok. Skyboxes are awesome, but since the maps are basically linear hallways with little room to explore, the graphics engine never gets a chance to shine.The maps. As i said above, i haven't played much. I also said that the maps are basically glorified straight lines. And linearity is ok if the gameplay is fun and the story is interesting. But since RAGE has neither of that. Its just really dull. Again, the engine seems perfect for rendering massive expansive worlds. But i have yet to see even a medium field in this game.The story. All i've really got is that a big rock hit the earth and almost everything died. Thats about it. Because now all i'm doing is running between two clans of hicks fetching things for them so they can continue to stand around doing nothing.Sound. Nothing special. The voice actors atleast sound like they're into it. But haven't really noticed anything unique.In short. This is what you get if you stick fallout and borderlands in a blender and set it to ""Boring"".3/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

MASSIVE loading times for every zone transition you'll be making every twenty minutes, and an ending that comes VERY quickly and out of nowhere.It's not terrible, but it's not great. It's very run-of-the-mill, nothing special. Only worth purchasing at low sale price and if you're bored.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												it's a poor attempt at borderlands.  pros:-fasted pace action, after running around like a minion talking to people-semi-open world environment and numerous (briefly entertaining) side games- AI is okay.  Baddies hide and run from spot to spot, sometimes they storm you in your hiding position.cons:-max 60 fps, which is pretty poor.-many low res textures in the game look weird, perhaps it was intended...-the game is very simple, no puzzles.  You just face forward and shoot.-it is very tiresome tried to find people in the bases, whereas you have a map and destination points when outside of the base.  So you end up running around like an idiot trying to find things in the base and have your hand held when outside.  not ideal.-this game would be a major disappointment without the scorcher DLC, still it was pretty disappointing.

												Overall, Rage is an OK game.  It tries to be part Mad Max, part Fallout, and part Doom but never seems to do much else that is original (other than the boomerang, which was neat).  You get to drive and do vehicular combat, shoot lots of things, buy and upgrade equipment, and go on many side missions.  Voice acting and sound are done very well.The graphics, while very unique, look great from afar but getting up close to anything looks crappy.  There is absolutely minimal interactivity with the environments so it's  very much focused on getting to the goal and not doing much else.  The story itself is mildly engaging, but really finishes with a blah ending.I can't say I loved it, but I never hated it either - I just wished it could have been something more.  It had all the potential to be. I've played it a few times now, so I guess I'll recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What could have been? RAGE had so much promise but in the end fell short. The story is pretty ordinary and the ending feels like it was created only to have a sequel come out immidiately afterwards as it doesn't really explain anything. Not much is explained throughout really. So if your looking for a FPS with a decent storyline, look elsewhere. What you will find here though is a solid FPS. The combat is great if you enjoy old school FPS action where waves of enemies come at you in arenas and corridors and you blow their heads off with a decently varied arsenal (special mention to the wingsticks which are kick-@ss). And let's be honest, who doesn't enjoy blowing mutants away in a Mad Max-esque wasteland. Come to think of it they could have just called this Mad Max. The setting and art style are very familiar in that respect. As is the driving where you'll be kitting out various vehicles with armour and weapons to take on bandit vechicles in the wasteland. The driving generally is reasonably forgettable and only serves to get to the next destination to blow away more bandit/mutant/authority scum.  There's a bunch of mini-games thrown in that are all pretty crap except for the card game. I actually thought that was cool. The graphics deserve a mention as they still hold up 4 years later and it still looks beautiful. Largely the graphical issues that plauged the PC port when it first came out have gone. Some of the scenery is amazing and the characters models are great and well animated. If you like good old school shooting then do yourself a favour and go bury a wingstick in a bandit's head.

I was ready to unenstall the game at that point, beacuse I could not run the car with my mouse, had to use my key board, reminded me of netendo64! But ince I mastered the car it was ok.

												A flawed gem.  Really cool guns with fun ammo types and interesting enemy AI, countered with bland mini games and a clumsy, tacked-on driving mechanic. The main town is a confusing labrynth, the missions are busy work and the story falls flat on its face just after the intro, but some of the characters are almost likable and Mutant Bash TV is a lot of fun.  Compared to the rest of id's catalogue it's garbage, but if you knock it over like a raccoon you'll find a scrap or two of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is a great game but you need to add a lot more to it like they did resident evil.  The cars are great and the challenges are cool.  Figureing out how to kill or destroy some of your enemies takes a lot of trial and error sometimes and that is what make the game so cool.  So please add more to it as fast as you can.

												I wasn't going to get this game, but after some careful thought and watching many trailers and game play videos, I decided to go out and give it a shot. I do not regret it one bit. This game is amazing. The graphics, sound, setting, ai, animations, mechanics, everything looks, and feels so good. Any fan of post-apocalyptic games needs to give this game a try. Any fan of shooters will not be disappointed, the enemies are always behaving in different ways, allowing you to utilise your entire arsenal in many different ways. The driving is a welcome addition and I found it a very enjoyable way to get to your quests. I've heard a lot of bad things (from critics and gamers alike), mainly in regards to story, but with a solid set of mechanics and awesome location and graphics, a less than awesome story is fine with me (I've only played 3 hours, so I am unable to give my own comments on the story). This game is definitely worth the money and you will not regret your purchase!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Apparently the game was plagued by buggy video drivers and issues when it came out and so there's still a lot of dismissal of it online, but when I got this game it ran perfectly and looked great. Texture quality could be better when you get right up against things, but from normal viewing distances it looks fine for when it came out. The gameplay is pretty bog-standard FPS with minimal RPG elements, but FPS is iD's bread and butter so it very well done for what it is.If you're going into it looking for something like Fallout or Borderlands, you're going to be very unsatisfied - the only commonalities are the general setting concept. While the visuals may not be the best in the world but the atmosphere itself still really stood out and I did at times wish it was a deeper or more open game set in that world.Campaign was about 18 hours for me which is pretty good for an FPS in my book - certainly more than any of the Quake single-player campaigns. There is a vehicular DM mode and short coop campaign mode, but I didn't try any of the multiplayer. I wish the main campaign supported coop as I would have loved to play through it with a friend.

												This is one of my favorite games. I absolutely loved the world and gameplay so much I beat it 3 times and did virtually everything the game has to offer. The story is nothing special but the characters are fantastic. The game runs very well and the graphics are fantastic with some of the best animations I have seen. Overall, a 9 out of 10 for me. The dlc for rage is short, but enjoyable, I would also recommend that if you enjoyed the base game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First the good:  Rage looks great.   The graphics, animations, character designs, etc, are all fantastic.  It also plays great.  The gameplay isn't anytihng really new, with the standard fps weapon selection and enemy types.   However, good enemy AI combined with their unique tendency to bob and weave and climb around levels, combined with very solid game mechanics, keeps things fun enough.   Vehicular combat is also enjoyable; rally racing itself seems like it could be a fun PVP standalone, and I'd love to have a local multiplayer version.  Now for the bad:  Nothing in Rage feels like it matters.  While the world and the characters in it look and sound great, none of them do anything or have any particular characteristics to make you care about them one way or the other.  They are merely window dressing.  The storyline itself is a bare bones mash up of Half Life 2 and Fallout, with bland generic factions like the Resistance and the Authority.  There is no main antagonist.   Missions are repetitive, with side quests basically just sending you back to zones you've already cleared in story missions.   It's also far too easy to actually be engaging, and you'll never really experience any of the tension that the games great looking enemies could have inspired.    Also, the game was also clearly designed and optimized for console, and some of the UI elements are just awful on PC (for example, only being able to assign 4 useable items to quickslot keys, rather than just allowing the player to assign them to whatever keys they like).  The game doesn't intelligently determine when you're using a keyboard/mouse or a controller, so controller propmts will stay on the screen even when using a keyboard until you disable the controller in settings (something I don't like doing, because generally I  use a controller for the driving portions of the game, and a keyboard/mouse for shooting).  There are also notiiceable performance issues, with framerates occasionaly plummetting for no good reason, and textures bouncing back and forth between high and low quality versions (this is on a gtx 960, which should be more than adequate to run this game at full settings).   I'm kind of on the fence about whether to recommend this game or not; really I'd give it about a 60-70 at most, and there are certainly better games out there to play.    Since Steams system requires giving it either a yay or nay, I'll recommend it with a couple of strong caveats: If you're looking for an engaging story, avoid it.  If you want a game that's perfectly optimized for PC, avoid it.   If you are strictly looking for a pretty looking, decent FPS, by all means give it a shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WINGSTICKS! buy right away, because these things are more deadly that bullets in this game. i really enjoyed my time with RAGE. you'll see the most beautiful sky dome in anygame.. then look at the most ugly plant in any game ever. for the most part this game looks amazing and plays well. The Scorchers DLC is worth trying out. adds a little extra to the game which in itself is rather short. and to quote my lovely & adoreable Steam friend ""did the ending make you RAAAGE?!?"" i know they're very funny lol, but no. i enjoyed the experience. the story was alright.caveat emptor (buyer beware): this game does not play nice with anything other than Nvidia cards (cards with CUDA). also, look to buy the retail copy (physical media) of the game, the special Anarchy Edition. it comes with some unique DLC which you can’t purchase on Steam.turn on smart v-sync & GPU transcode in the options menu in gamecreate a cache folder in this location name/AppData/Local (Windows start menu, ""%temp%"" click entre and work backwards)  “id software” go into it and create a second folder called “rage” (all in lower case) and once you start the game again it’ll create cache files to reduce stutter and texture pop.in the""base"" folder where your copy of RAGE is installed. copy the .cfg file and rename it to rageconfig.cfg if you don’t already have one. open with notepad and delete all the text. write “+cvaradd g_fov 10” which adds +10 to the base field of view. *optional lines to add*com_videoRam 2048fc_maxcachememoryMB 2048vt_useCudaTranscode 0vt_maxPPF 128vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly2 8192vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly 8192vt_pageimagesizeunique 8192vt_pageimagesizevmtr 8192vt_restartvt_maxaniso 4image_anisotropy 4			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not very good, not very fun. Small open world with nothing to do and no reason to spend any time there. Levels are reused multiple times, and there are only a handful of them and they are the definition of linear. 70% of combat is just fighting off waves of enemies while locked in small areas, the other 30% is a corridor shooter with bullet sponge enemies. Invisible walls EVERYWHERE. It runs like garbage for what it is. Tons of audio glitches. Some textures, specifically environmental ones, look beautiful from far away, but terrible once you get close. The game as a whole seems poorly thought out and the story and missions rushed and incomplete.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 5, 2015
												Its been a long time coming but today i finally finished this bloody game.I bought it a few weeks after launch, but it hasn't taken me this long to beat it because its difficult or long, its just.. a frustratingly beautiful game.I think i uninstalled / installed this game 4 or 5 times. Its 20 bloody gigs and there were times when i needed the space and felt the game just wasn't worth playing any more. Being a huge fan of Doom and most of i.d's games, i forced myself to give it another crack.I'll say it again. This game is frustrating. Not due to difficulty, but because of how often you will ask ""what were they thinking?!"".There is just far too much back tracking across the landscape for running pathetic errands. I was turned off immediately by how quickly your pulled into a conflict rather than a slow build up. Within 5 minites of the first guy saving your life after you step out of the life pod, he's asking you to go to a bandit camp and wipe them all out. Sorry, but the player JUST woke up from some kind of hyper sleep pod thing 5 minutes ago and 100 years has passed. He should be walked through the game and given some warm up missions and shown what kind of word he has woken up into.A big problem that will hit PC games early, is how much this game feels like its on rails. Lets not beat around the bush. This is a console game, designed for boys with game pads. You don't have any freedom to go where you want. See a hand rail thats only knee high and want to jump over? Nope. Invisible wall. Want to jump onto that rock? Nope, invisible wall. See all that cool environment around you that you want to explore every inch of to find hidden stuff? Nope, its all blocked off by invisible walls.To be fair, this is probably i.d's finest work. Its the best attempt at a story yet and the art is simply amazing. The Jackel Canyon level has got to be one of the most visually stunning game environments i've ever seen. The megatexture tech making every rock wall of this level look unique and truly beautiful. The final level, for all its failures, is still an incredibly detailed level that few games can compete with for detail. Including Crysis 3. That is until you get up close and everything looks as if its made from poor quality printed photos on paper. Its grainy and blurry and possibly some of the most heartbreakingly awful compression thats ever happened to a games textures. Those poor artists!Surely they must've all played the game and thought to themselves ""wow, all our lovel art looks terrible now, we should really release a different version for the PC on Bluray with uncompressed textures"", right? No. This is where the problem of a developer being at the mercy of a publisher rears its ugly head. The publisher pushes them to release on all platforms at once to maximize sales and keep the consumers happy. The days of releasing a top quality ground breaking game for PC, then scaling it back for console gamers is over (ahem crytek..). Plus, no one wants to deal with complaints from hoardes of twelve year olds that the PC version looks amzing, yet on their console it looks like its viewed from the eyes of an 18 year old fox terrier with glaucoma.If you have not yet played Borderlands, wait till you've played Rage. Otherwise you'll spend way too much time cringing at just how ""on rails"" this game is. Play Borderlands afterwards, and see what potential Rage had.The combat is ace and the art and animations are first class, but the scale is let down by limited freedom to explore and a weak vehicle element.Sure its an enjoyable shooter and i'll recommend it simply for the combat, but only if you pick it up from a bargain bin for $5.

												Not really a bad game, but coming from ID, it kind of disappointed me. Yes, I am aware that its also Bethesda now, but that might just be the problem. The mechanics are fair, the enemies are pretty interesting, and the textures are nice, along with the weapons in my opinion. However, the weapons are more typical of the more common first person shooter. Having devastating ammo types was a good move, but I believe that the weapons in general should be lootable from various enemies. The other issue is that this is a pretty bad port for a beloved studio such as ID. All in all, it's worth the current price, but don't expect to much out of this game. I have noticed that people have bashed this game for ripping off borderlands. That is actually false, as this game was in development before borderlands, even if it came out last. You can thank 2k for their brilliant rip-off known as borderlands. This game does borrow a lot from fallout, which is only excusable if you count the fact that both this game and fallout 3 through 4 were made by Bethesda.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RAGE is a First-Person Open World Shooter with Survival Horror elements and inspiration from Mad Max. The graphics look very well polished, for a wasteland, and the gameplay is well done. The storyline isn't anything good, to be honest, the worst ending of gaming. Back to Gameplay, the combat is fun, same to Coop. So here we go for Pros and Cons!Pros:+Completly Gorgeous Looking Sky+Great Gameplay+Fun Coop Mode+Mad Max Inspiration+Creepy at points+Weapon Variety and Idle Animations+Easter Eggs+Well Used Cars (like Mad Max!)Cons:-Bad Storyline-Slightly Small Open World-Texture Pop-Ups and Rendering Delay-Graphics are not SO good-Short-Optimization Issues-A.I isn't very good-Shooting is inferior than 1993's DOOMOverall, RAGE is a good game but it isn't great. It's fun and a lot more, but for a long time of development, 1 TB of size when compressed, and the wasted potential, RAGE slightly falls short, but for me, RAGE is a game definately worth playing.7.9/10 ~Great Mad Max Inspiration.

												It was pretty good but I feel like there should have been a lot more to the game after the long dev time. I don't really know what all the jazz was about the engine, certainly wasn't an ugly game but not what I expected. I found that the only weapons I used were the sniper, shotty and rocket launcher (for the bigger guys), never used one turret or health pack, maybe 2 or three bots, I never found any reason or incentive to be creative with the ammo types (just stuck with the standard) or craftable items. I did enjoy the game but I'm glad I didn't pay 60 dollars for it. Racing/driving sections were meh and the game was overall VERY easy even on the hardest mode. Oh yeah the ending was balls. I guess I expected more from id but it seems all the old school devs are not putting any heart into their games anymore (with the exception of a couple). Probably just me getting old and cranky.

												The fact that it's an iD game creates certain expectations and it may not live up to that hype. But if you look beyond that, then there's a fun game with really good graphics and atmosphere. The firefights may not be all that challenging a lot of the times but the game brings a lot of diversity with driving sections and minigames (some of which are cool, others quite boring). While the story is mostly fluff, the wonderfully designed environments it takes you through are easily worth the effort.The PC version works fine (download the rageconfig file to fix the texture memory usage!) but all the UI hints are still for an XBOX controller and it's never clear what key on your keyboard maps to A, B, X or Y.Don't let that stand in your way of enjoying a very entertaining game though.

												Pretty cool game, feels like the oldschool shooters but missed the final boss fight. I usualy play every game in normal diff and this game did not sweated me at all, so you may take it on hard diff. The maps are beautiful but linear at construction, so very easy to find your way even in heavy action. Authority and their mutants are too weak in the whole game, just one pop rocket do the work in most case... It's ridiculous that Gearheads are tougher then Authority.I armed myself to the teeth for the finish, but could run through with just only pop rockets with some wing sticks and EMPs. At first time I didn't even need a single shoot with that plasma cannon at all. Really disappointed me the short end game, so where is the boss of Authority? After all the impressive game time I've only got that weak finish. Waited for more action, to return from Capital Prime and win a war or sg, but credits just interrupted.I feel there were more potential in game, just like viper rockets. When should I use those? Never ever was in a situation to get down a vehicle on foot... Mind control bolts? See the enemy as his head blows into pieces is fun, but there is no real need to use it. Maybe on higher difficulties player has a need to economize the resources better, but if you have plenty of everything, that ruins the game and I even didn't cheat a single dollar to simple get everything I would need. By the way are there any cheats? You won't need them.Oh and finally the low-mid VGAs with extra lot vram makes sense now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its been a long time coming but today i finally finished this bloody game.I bought it a few weeks after launch, but it hasn't taken me this long to beat it because its difficult or long, its just.. a frustratingly beautiful game.I think i uninstalled / installed this game 4 or 5 times. Its 20 bloody gigs and there were times when i needed the space and felt the game just wasn't worth playing any more. Being a huge fan of Doom and most of i.d's games, i forced myself to give it another crack.I'll say it again. This game is frustrating. Not due to difficulty, but because of how often you will ask ""what were they thinking?!"".There is just far too much back tracking across the landscape for running pathetic errands. I was turned off immediately by how quickly your pulled into a conflict rather than a slow build up. Within 5 minites of the first guy saving your life after you step out of the life pod, he's asking you to go to a bandit camp and wipe them all out. Sorry, but the player JUST woke up from some kind of hyper sleep pod thing 5 minutes ago and 100 years has passed. He should be walked through the game and given some warm up missions and shown what kind of word he has woken up into.A big problem that will hit PC games early, is how much this game feels like its on rails. Lets not beat around the bush. This is a console game, designed for boys with game pads. You don't have any freedom to go where you want. See a hand rail thats only knee high and want to jump over? Nope. Invisible wall. Want to jump onto that rock? Nope, invisible wall. See all that cool environment around you that you want to explore every inch of to find hidden stuff? Nope, its all blocked off by invisible walls.To be fair, this is probably i.d's finest work. Its the best attempt at a story yet and the art is simply amazing. The Jackel Canyon level has got to be one of the most visually stunning game environments i've ever seen. The megatexture tech making every rock wall of this level look unique and truly beautiful. The final level, for all its failures, is still an incredibly detailed level that few games can compete with for detail. Including Crysis 3. That is until you get up close and everything looks as if its made from poor quality printed photos on paper. Its grainy and blurry and possibly some of the most heartbreakingly awful compression thats ever happened to a games textures. Those poor artists!Surely they must've all played the game and thought to themselves ""wow, all our lovel art looks terrible now, we should really release a different version for the PC on Bluray with uncompressed textures"", right? No. This is where the problem of a developer being at the mercy of a publisher rears its ugly head. The publisher pushes them to release on all platforms at once to maximize sales and keep the consumers happy. The days of releasing a top quality ground breaking game for PC, then scaling it back for console gamers is over (ahem crytek..). Plus, no one wants to deal with complaints from hoardes of twelve year olds that the PC version looks amzing, yet on their console it looks like its viewed from the eyes of an 18 year old fox terrier with glaucoma.If you have not yet played Borderlands, wait till you've played Rage. Otherwise you'll spend way too much time cringing at just how ""on rails"" this game is. Play Borderlands afterwards, and see what potential Rage had.The combat is ace and the art and animations are first class, but the scale is let down by limited freedom to explore and a weak vehicle element.Sure its an enjoyable shooter and i'll recommend it simply for the combat, but only if you pick it up from a bargain bin for $5.

												Linear gameplay, with the enemies saying the same boring lines over and over. ""There he is sue-ka!"", ""Get HIM Sue-ka!"" If you like games where the rocket launcher does nothing and the enemies play hide and shoot. Give it a try. Otherwise buy Metro, Fallout, or Borderlands.The only thing I enjoyed in the game was the car battles, but hey Gas Guzzlers offers a similar play in that field.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not really a bad game, but coming from ID, it kind of disappointed me. Yes, I am aware that its also Bethesda now, but that might just be the problem. The mechanics are fair, the enemies are pretty interesting, and the textures are nice, along with the weapons in my opinion. However, the weapons are more typical of the more common first person shooter. Having devastating ammo types was a good move, but I believe that the weapons in general should be lootable from various enemies. The other issue is that this is a pretty bad port for a beloved studio such as ID. All in all, it's worth the current price, but don't expect to much out of this game. I have noticed that people have bashed this game for ripping off borderlands. That is actually false, as this game was in development before borderlands, even if it came out last. You can thank 2k for their brilliant rip-off known as borderlands. This game does borrow a lot from fallout, which is only excusable if you count the fact that both this game and fallout 3 through 4 were made by Bethesda.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is a great game but you need to add a lot more to it like they did resident evil.  The cars are great and the challenges are cool.  Figureing out how to kill or destroy some of your enemies takes a lot of trial and error sometimes and that is what make the game so cool.  So please add more to it as fast as you can.

												I wasn't going to get this game, but after some careful thought and watching many trailers and game play videos, I decided to go out and give it a shot. I do not regret it one bit. This game is amazing. The graphics, sound, setting, ai, animations, mechanics, everything looks, and feels so good. Any fan of post-apocalyptic games needs to give this game a try. Any fan of shooters will not be disappointed, the enemies are always behaving in different ways, allowing you to utilise your entire arsenal in many different ways. The driving is a welcome addition and I found it a very enjoyable way to get to your quests. I've heard a lot of bad things (from critics and gamers alike), mainly in regards to story, but with a solid set of mechanics and awesome location and graphics, a less than awesome story is fine with me (I've only played 3 hours, so I am unable to give my own comments on the story). This game is definitely worth the money and you will not regret your purchase!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Apparently the game was plagued by buggy video drivers and issues when it came out and so there's still a lot of dismissal of it online, but when I got this game it ran perfectly and looked great. Texture quality could be better when you get right up against things, but from normal viewing distances it looks fine for when it came out. The gameplay is pretty bog-standard FPS with minimal RPG elements, but FPS is iD's bread and butter so it very well done for what it is.If you're going into it looking for something like Fallout or Borderlands, you're going to be very unsatisfied - the only commonalities are the general setting concept. While the visuals may not be the best in the world but the atmosphere itself still really stood out and I did at times wish it was a deeper or more open game set in that world.Campaign was about 18 hours for me which is pretty good for an FPS in my book - certainly more than any of the Quake single-player campaigns. There is a vehicular DM mode and short coop campaign mode, but I didn't try any of the multiplayer. I wish the main campaign supported coop as I would have loved to play through it with a friend.

												This is one of my favorite games. I absolutely loved the world and gameplay so much I beat it 3 times and did virtually everything the game has to offer. The story is nothing special but the characters are fantastic. The game runs very well and the graphics are fantastic with some of the best animations I have seen. Overall, a 9 out of 10 for me. The dlc for rage is short, but enjoyable, I would also recommend that if you enjoyed the base game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First the good:  Rage looks great.   The graphics, animations, character designs, etc, are all fantastic.  It also plays great.  The gameplay isn't anytihng really new, with the standard fps weapon selection and enemy types.   However, good enemy AI combined with their unique tendency to bob and weave and climb around levels, combined with very solid game mechanics, keeps things fun enough.   Vehicular combat is also enjoyable; rally racing itself seems like it could be a fun PVP standalone, and I'd love to have a local multiplayer version.  Now for the bad:  Nothing in Rage feels like it matters.  While the world and the characters in it look and sound great, none of them do anything or have any particular characteristics to make you care about them one way or the other.  They are merely window dressing.  The storyline itself is a bare bones mash up of Half Life 2 and Fallout, with bland generic factions like the Resistance and the Authority.  There is no main antagonist.   Missions are repetitive, with side quests basically just sending you back to zones you've already cleared in story missions.   It's also far too easy to actually be engaging, and you'll never really experience any of the tension that the games great looking enemies could have inspired.    Also, the game was also clearly designed and optimized for console, and some of the UI elements are just awful on PC (for example, only being able to assign 4 useable items to quickslot keys, rather than just allowing the player to assign them to whatever keys they like).  The game doesn't intelligently determine when you're using a keyboard/mouse or a controller, so controller propmts will stay on the screen even when using a keyboard until you disable the controller in settings (something I don't like doing, because generally I  use a controller for the driving portions of the game, and a keyboard/mouse for shooting).  There are also notiiceable performance issues, with framerates occasionaly plummetting for no good reason, and textures bouncing back and forth between high and low quality versions (this is on a gtx 960, which should be more than adequate to run this game at full settings).   I'm kind of on the fence about whether to recommend this game or not; really I'd give it about a 60-70 at most, and there are certainly better games out there to play.    Since Steams system requires giving it either a yay or nay, I'll recommend it with a couple of strong caveats: If you're looking for an engaging story, avoid it.  If you want a game that's perfectly optimized for PC, avoid it.   If you are strictly looking for a pretty looking, decent FPS, by all means give it a shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had lots of fun playing this game.  The environments are very interesting, and the weapons and cars are great.  Sometimes I ran out of ammo which was not too great. The story is immersive and understanding each of the characters and towns is important for this story, and the environments tell part of the game's story too.

MASSIVE loading times for every zone transition you'll be making every twenty minutes, and an ending that comes VERY quickly and out of nowhere.It's not terrible, but it's not great.

												I love this game, even though it looks terrible nowadays compared to some titles from 2011. My main complaint though? 60fps cap.This is the first game I fired up after getting a 144hz monitor, and it looks so incredibly stuttery it's almost unplayable compared to virtually every other game that supports an uncapped framerate. Why, id, why couldn't you uncap the framerate to make it future-proof? Anyone else playing on a 144hz monitor will know exactly what I mean by stuttery (it has nothing to do with spec, I'm playing on a GTX 980/4th Gen i5)Is it a good game? Yes. Can I play it in its current state? No. The juddering is too much to live with I'm afraid, not when 98% of all fps games haven't capped their framerates.			",562,91,9,80,49,2,77

												This game gets a bad rap at times, and people want to compare it to the Borderlands games. It's a fun game and the only big similarities it shares with Borderlands is the sandy/dusty/craggy landscape and driving cars around. The driving is a fairly big part of the game, as you can race for money to upgrade your vehicle further and thus have better armor out on the ""roads"" when doing missiony stuff. The rest of the game is a first person shooter with a nice 90s-style like...dozen weapons or so, as I recall, at least with the DLC...which I would recommend getting a few hours into the game if you find yourself enjoying it so far.There's some crafting, a few little minor upgrades (increasing max health and weapon parts), and NPCs to get a small number of quests/missions from. The story is alright, though not very engrossing. The setting and gameplay are the big draws here. I will say now that the ending sucks. It's boring and weak. That is all. With that out of the way, though, I found myself liking this game quite a bit. If you find it cheap, you might pick it up if you're not hurting for cash.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Моя оценка этой игры 8 из 10.Игра мне понравилась неплохой графикой,наличием разных мини-игр,и вооружением(для каждого оружия 4 типа патрон на ваш вкус буть-то скажем динамитные и электрострелы или же для любителей стелса просто стальные наконечники или стрелы контроля разума к примеру)геймплей в 18-20 часов если доп.задания выполнять в принципе не надоедает как и перестрелки с врагами  при этом можно использовать различные средства к примеру(машины мины,турели,роботы,бумеранги срубающие врагам бошки)и всё это можно сделать самому как и особые патроны и медикаменты но тем не менее сюжет довольно схож с  фалаутом 3( то же от  этих же создателей бифездэй)и концовка то ли отсылка на следующюю часть то ли просто создатели решили над ней не слишком  напрягаться. Ну в общем  я советую вам поиграть в эту игру если вам понравился фалаут3(или 1 и 2)  или вы просто любитель постапокала но если вы в целом ненавидите творчество бифесдэй то можете ненадеятся что этот проект обелит их в ваших глазах.

												From graphical issues (even on high-end machines) to awkward physics, RAGE dissapoints. I had bought this game a few years ago and was not able to play it until recently, due to an issue where certain processors caused the game to fail to run. Having finally been able to play it, I can tell you with full certainty that it is a waste of the ten dollars I paid for it (physical retail price). Textures due not load quickly, meaning that one shopkeeper looks like an oversized deformed baby prior to his stubble and facial features loading, which takes a few seconds of staring at him. Textures un-render as soon as you turn away, meaning the whole game is played while staring at a child's first attempt at a watercolor painting. The physics are laughable as well. You obtain vehicles early in the game, and while backing up (slowly, I might add) I bumped into a wall. My character was ejected from the seat, hurled into an overhanging roof, and slammed back down into the ground. Respawn. This game plays like the unwanted child of a three-way between Fallout, Borderlands, and Call of Duty. It is clunky, enemies are relatively unintelligent unless they posses the ability to one-shot or two-shot you with their weapon, in which case they have impeccable aiming. Fetch-quests are rampant, and you will be going back and forth between locations within five minutes of completing the tutorial. Less than two hours of playtime, and the game is being uninstalled from my computer. It takes up more space than it's worth.			",286,85,18,51,29,5,39

												An underwhelming engine demo from id.  This time they just packaged it in a bargain bin version of Borderlands.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
