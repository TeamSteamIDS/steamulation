												I really, really wanted to like this. Vlambeer is one of my favorite developers, and I do have a small soft spot for serious sam. The problem with Serious Sam: The Random Encounter is it's a bit like Space Jam, it's an idea that sounds really great on paper but doesn't work so well in execution. It's pretty much a heavily scripted pixelated turn based RPG which has one of the oddest turn based/action combat hybrids I've ever seen. You pick a character, pick a weapon or if you want them to use an item, and then point them in a direction to fire said weapon or use said item. Then you get around 5-10 seconds of action while you try to dodge bullets and hit targets with the aim you set. The problem with this is that especially when you gain a third party member, it becomes almost impossible to actually dodge anything or have any real ""skill"" with dodging or hitting. As hordes get bigger later on, aiming gets less useful too, as hordes will get so big that it pretty much doesn't matter where you aim. Keep in mind this is a scripted RPG, so no shops, no ""real"" overworld and every item or weapon you get is found as part of the rigidly scripted story that's underwritten even for Serious Sam. There are technically ""Random encounters"" (heh), but with the rewards they dole out it's actually more resource efficient to just skip straight to the next area.It's just not worth it. You will probably get about 3-4 stages in like I did and quit when the Texan comes into play because of how impossible it is to keep going. Buy it maybe it if goes on sale for like a dollar and you're curious. You won't even get an hour out of this.			",240,21,1,20,5,2,17

												This is an old school RPG based around the Serious Sam franchise. You'll have a top down map with enemy encounters and be taken to a RPG style battle system. The map worlds are literally one screen sections, if your party is wiped out three times, you need to restart that one map. It would feel right at home on the original Gameboy or a mobile phone. Random battles can happen when you walk one space on the map, so if that angers you, avoid this game.The real game is the combat, each battle pits you and your allies against several if not dozens or hundreds of enemies chasing after you. You select fight, swap weapon or item. Any of your characters can use any weapon. Here's where it gets interesting, the weapons and enemies have uses like in an action game. The revolver will shoot at the closest enemy, the shotgun is a defensive weapon if any enemies or big projectiles get within a proximity of the user, the rocket launcher sends a spread of 3 rockets one per turn, the grenade launcher does big damage.... if you can hit your target in it, since enemies move, they might be gone before the grenade lands, and there's a mini gun where you aim the line and fire until the end of the turn. Enemies have different properties too. Some will stay far and shoot, others will chase after you and damage you, killing themselves. Enemies are quicker and slower than you, so you can either outrun them or they'll catch you. All of the combat is a really fresh take on RPG turn based combat. Oh and as your turn is happening, you can move your party up and down on the screen to dodge projectiles or stall for time as you wait for the next shotgun blast.After every battle, you get full health. The items mostly consist of armor power ups, health, attack buffs. All of which seem to be needed for bosses at the end of each one screen map.So if I enjoy the game how could I give it a negative rating? The game is a steep climb in difficulty before you know it. Walls of bullets, things become unavoidable, deaths are inevitable even if party members are revived with full health after a battle. Everything needs to be done in battle and that is the real downfall. You cannot use any items such as armor outside of battle. So if you're facing a wall of bullets against dozens or hundreds of enemies, you'll just get slaughtered again and again. Luck of who you fight plays a big part of your survival. You can grind all you want before a boss battle. The catch is once you've used your 3 lives, you'll need to start that map over again without all of the grinding you just did. Another problem with lack of grinding is that you can't go back to a previous map to grind and no amount of grinding will save you from bullet walls that comes with every enemy encounter past a few maps. Another downfall is there is no native controller or steam support. Not even key binding, but everything else is a much bigger glaring issue.In all, its just a fresh take on old school RPGs and I like it, but its as if the developers didn't play the game past a certain point. If you're looking for a very difficult new RPG that is unforgiving and makes grinding meaningless, this is the game for you.			",1126,324,51,104,96,15,167

Short version: 39%Unless you are a Serious Sam fanatic, skip this one; while it is mercifully short, this turn-based action game is plagued with terrible choices that just kill most of the fun.Long version:Serious Sam: The Random Encounter is not a complex game: the player roams around on a top-down 2D map with Sam and two nameless guys – banded together with the intent of shooting Mental in the face (this is the entire plot, by the way) –, where they randomly end up in side-scrolling battle sequences. This sounds simple (and looks simple thanks to the 16-bit style graphics), yet somehow the developers of Nuclear Throne still managed to mess everything up.The core flaw of the game is that it is nothing but randomness. It is only mildly frustrating that the same level can throw in three encounters or a dozen during the exact same trip. The real pain starts during combat when one realises they have zero influence on the outcome, as the player can issue exactly one command every five seconds (shoot, swap weapon, or use item) but the enemy horde attacks in real time; winning is just a question of luck on enemy composition and movement patterns. Due to this unpredictable and aggravating mechanic, it takes an unjustly amount of patience to even get to the final boss; a patience most players will probably lack.			",78,260,0,12,9,2,21

												Don't be fooled by the trailer with all those camera close-ups, it's doesn't have that much action, You have 3 guys, sam and 2 his friends, you have like 5 seconds to shoot something then you have to pick what to do next for every single character attack again, change weapon or use skills. It's something between FF and SS but as this game shows FF+SS=FFS:+This game has plenty of manly sam jokes in-between levels+Notable monsters from the SS series-This game is unplayable boring - you ever thought that serious sam game could be boring AF? No? Here you go. Somebody thought it would be fun to breed action and turn-base but its sucks so much, it takes like 80% of the time to pick what to do and 20% of the time you see any action + with most weapons you use shoot instantly and then you try to dodge stuff but this level design don't let you understand where the projectile going + you have 3 characters so you cant dodge all the stuff even if you want,-This game so hard to beat, that with the addition of how boring it makes you want to kill yourself when you die from the huge wave of random crаp because you have to play this level all over again. Wow such a nice game, so you don't want to waste your time on it, isn't it nice?-it has no steam achievements or steam cards So, in conclusion, there is no any reason to buy this sh`tty game other than to fill your library with 1 more Serious Sam game if you want to collect them all. Otherwise, i highly recommend not to buy this crap.Join my curator grouphttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/garbage_games_challenge#curation ",2056,824,59,208,221,16,291

												Although I can't recommend Serious Sam: Random Encounter at the full $5 asking price, it is a fun little game to kill some time. Not something you'll spend a bunch of time on, but it's something that can be played here and there. It's like the original Final Fantasy with guns, but it's not as strategic. Unless you buy the Serious Sam Complete Pack, this is on sale for $.49 again, or you're into very plain turn-based games, this should not be in your library.			",208,25,0,13,4,3,3

												If you're thinking that this cheap game will keep you going for a while, you are awfully wrong!Serious Sam: The Random Encounter is a short Run'n Gun game that features only 9 levels which roughly take up to about 2 hours to beat. After finishing the campaign, the player will be given the opportunity to play in Endless Mode, but without any real goal in mind, this would just be a waste of time.Because the game is so short, the developers made sure to make it extra hard just to frustrate the player into believing the game took a really long time to beat. This also has a big impact on it's replay value, because without featuring any kind of achievements or incentives(like extra content), a typical user will not want to have another go at it just for sheer fun.Also atypically for any game, Serious Sam: The Random Encounter encourages you to die a few times during a level just to cheat and get a couple more copies of a weapon that can make the rest of the game a lot easier. This is sad and game-braking at the same time, but judging the overall quality of the game, it is something that should have been expected.On a side-note, screenshots made in fullscreen mode will look weird. The picture will feature a small screenshot in one of the corners followed by a black background and some traces of any pop-ups that may have appeared on screen during this time.Although I have bought it for about 0.80€ I still believe this game to be a terrible waste of money and I wouldn't recommend buying it. Please, do note that the game has compatibility issues on some systems, so make sure you can play it in case you want to pick it up.			",174,44,3,27,11,2,21

												SS:TRE is a turn-based action game that lives up to its name: there are a lot of random encounters. On the overworld screen, you play room by room, top-down view, moving a space at a time and opening crates for items, solving minor puzzles and beating random encounters, while making your way to the exit/boss. Battle is turn-based and takes place on a separate screen, where a horde of classic enemies from the series rush you. You have three options: fight, swap (guns), and use item. Choosing fight lets you aim your current weapon at the horde and, when you confirm, the action takes place. You then run backwards while shooting at the horde of enemies, and they run forward trying to reach and kill you. This goes on for five seconds before the next turn. You'll recruit additional party members and find plenty of weapons to choose from but, contrary to the description, there's no RPG here. Resolution is ridiculously small, the difficulty is too brutal and random and, overall, it's the worst Sam game I've played, which is saying something.			",2958,1175,116,358,419,33,494

												This is a cool game. The mechanics of the game are simple. Passed it in 2.5h of playthrough.I will do some pros and cons for the gamePROS-The game is simple and easy to play-No bugs and glitches in the game (I never experienced one)-You have 3 characters with which you play-The game has classic Serious Sam weapons-The game looks small, but it has a lot af aliens you can kill and there are a lot of fights in which you participate-There are bosses at the end of different sets of areas you play in-The art for the game is awesome. Even for this kind of a game-You have 3 lives on each map (I don't know if this is a pro or a con, so I will leave it here), and when you spend all of the lives you restart the whole map from the beginningCONS-Community is almost dead-Game gets me angry when enemies always spawn when I have spent all of my Special ItemsI recommend it. I rate it 7/10. Would kill 100 aliens in one fight again!			",89,1,3,1,7,0,7

												It's not often that words fail me, but in this case I think they might.  There's just no way to fully describe the variety of reactions that I get when playing this game.  I can describe SOME of it - enjoyment, amusement, mild frustration, more amusement - but more than anything this is something I simply did not expect in a Serious Sam title.Briefly, the game plays a bit like a classic turn-based RPG, with you selecting actions (primarily attacking) while facing off against enemies.  What makes this a Serious Sam game is that it's initally just Sam against 20+ enemies per encounter, and you're running backwards as they're running towards you.  The format is also a bit different in that you can move Sam around as wave after wave of enemy heads towards you, allowing you to dodge attacks, or try at any rate.  As you progress through the game you gain two other allies who you can control during fights.  This improves your damage output but makes dodging much harder, as all three move as one unit.  In between fights you move around on an overhead view map, encountering enemies randomly as you move; thus, the name.Of course, what also makes this a proper Serious Sam game is the weapons you are given.  Initially limited to a Revolver and Minigun, you eventually pick up nearly the full compliment of Serious Sam weapons: shotgun, rocket launcher, laser rifle, sniper rifle, grenade launcher, and even the Cannon.  Each has been balanced fairly well for the way the game plays, with differing strengths and weaknesses. Last but not least, the game has no shortage of humor, perfectly on tone for Sam and his usual shenanigans.  Many of the jokes are aimed at the game's new format, with Sam complaining about ""puzzles"" (read: having to pick up a key) for example.In the end, Serious Sam: The Random Encounter is an amusing and enjoyable spinoff of the Serious Sam brand, though admittedly a very short one.  On my first attempt it took me about an hour to get through the entirety of the game to the final boss.  I won't say that's a dealbreaker, especially since the game has a reasonable replay value, but it's worth knowing when you're deciding how much you're willing to pay for a copy.  If you need something to kill an hour or two, you could do far worse.			",348,79,4,32,12,1,19

												If you don't want to read all of that then read the last paragraph.Well, let's see, I love Serious Sam, the first one is my favorite, I consider the second as one of my favorite game too (don't ask, I have a lot of favorites since I love many genres), the third one was good but for some reasons, I didn't like it as much as the rest of the players did even with the modern FPS settings off, not saying that it is a bad game, just not as great as it should be.Serious Sam Double D XXL is a great game, different but great, not the greatest of the platformer ever it's a good game anyway.The other Serious Sam games are just remasters so I won't be talking about them.Now, we got this game, Serious Sam: The Random Encounter.Is it good? No, not really. I tried to like it, I tried to, but I just can't.It's just boring, I thought that Call of Duty was the most boring game ever, well, I may be wrong... Or perhaps not, but anyway.This game needs one thing, and it's a whole new gameplay, new mechanics, new of almost everything.This game was made by those who made Nuclear Throne four years later.If this game would have been similar in terms of gameplay to Nuclear Throne, now that would be something!Serious Sam bullet hell/twin stick shooter with rogue-like elements.Now I would play that.But it ain't the case.It's just a boring game with a guy on LSD and cocaine who thinks he's Serious Sam while he's not... Just... Just look at him... It's horrible... He doesn't looks like Serious Sam at all... But anyway, if you decide to play this game, it will be the last of your problems. I actually love games such as Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and Chrono Trigger but it just don't work well with this game.In a few words, it's boring, the problem mostly come from its gameplay mehanics, it's just blend and boring.Luckily for me and for probably most of the people who owns this game, I/we got it with the complete pack/bundle.3.5/10			",972,203,71,193,128,3,223

												The game is a fun little time waster. I'd pick it up for the fiver because I love sam but waiting for a sale wont kill you since its not a must buy.Only problem is the game does crash repeatedly on windows 8 and 8.1. It's completely unplayable so be aware of that.			",199,51,4,21,16,0,12

												I really liked the Serious Sam series, but this game was just an unfair challenge from the begining without any real sense of skill-based rewarding gameplay. Imagine if I set you up with an FPS game, where you have to pick 1 axis to move and are allowed to spam in a locked angle with one weapon for 5 seconds at a time. This game does exactly that. I felt like I had about as much an advantage as anyone does with a crane machine full of frightened birds.In short, do yourself a favor, and spend those 5 dollars on a nice friggin cheeseburger, because at least that burger wont request to be eaten from within a tube sock, using nothing but a set of plastic chopsticks.

												Do not consider buying this unless it drops to £2 or lower; it is a 2-hour game at best, and the Endless Mode you eventually unlock probably won't be played more than once.The challege the devs set themselves was to combine Serious Sam gameplay with its polar opposite gameplay type (turn-based RPG) and make it work. They succeeded, but the result wouldn't be good enough to support a large campaign, hence the tiny length of the main 'Story' mode here. The minimalist dialogue is both appropriate and funny, and the game itself doesn't try to hold your attention any longer than it ought to.I love the idea and most of the execution, but I can't say I've had my money's-worth of entertainment from it.

												It's not as bad as the reviews lead you to believe. Yes, the graphics are incredibly simple, and yes, Serious Sam is involved (good thing) with some other, random characters (bad thing). It's all pretty forgettable. The humor is cheesy and the gameplay itself isn't all that spectacular, but the combat is kind of original. It's 2D and turn based (nothing new so far), but during battle you can increase the radius (and, therefore, power) and the aim of your weapon. I personally haven't seen this mechanic before and it's somewhat exciting. It works well if you ask me.But unfortunately the rest of the game is a total letdown; it's just not as bad as people want you to believe. Give it a chance.[Rating: 66/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												As much I want to recommend this game I can't. Simply because it is boring. It is turned based like last remnant. But the action isn't the middle of the game. You have 2 characters which you control. In each round you can decide which weapon they use and which area you want to attack it with. After the fights it is a different map, e.g. pokemon. You are walking around till next battle. Overall I found it pretty lame. The enemies and the characters  aren't compareable to the normal serious sam games. To the sound: The sound is relativly good compared to the rest of the game.Overall I give the game a 3/10. It is playable when you have nothing to do and need to chill a bit. But wouldn't recommend it for hardcore serious sam fans.			",113,23,1,4,2,0,6

												Unless I missed something critical, this game takes about half an hour to complete. Maybe not even that. Good, mindless fun ... maybe a little too mindless. It's a fun take on the old school, turn-based JRPG genre. I just wish there were better options for weapons and greater variety of enemy attacked. Basically, you're swarmed by enemies. That's it. I'd rate this a 6, but one really needs to factor in price when deciding to buy. I paid about $1 for it and am quite happy with this purchase. But for $2.50 and up, given the other things you can buy on Steam on sale at that price, I probably wouldn't bother.			",725,284,47,114,46,8,71

												The idea of this: A Serious SAM RPG Parody seems like it could work.  At first this game seems like it will be a lot of fun and silly.  By level 3, 3:  I was upset at the random volume of monsters and how the charactors shoot per turn.In this game you select which guns you want the chars to use each round.  They shoot one-three times depending on the gun and then the next round you pick again.  You can move them up/down to dodge bullets but mostly stuck since you cannot really move around hardly at all once you have three chars on screen.It was fun, I enjoyed it.... then the difficulty went random.  You can sometimes get smacked down on the first round no matter what guns you pick.  If you do not farm on the first couple of levels for items, then the later levels you will use up all your items and be kind of stuck dealing with hordes and no power ups.Anyways, liked the idea but it did not come through near the middle.

Serious Sam: The Random Encounter is a mash-up of Serious Sam, old-school JRPGs (say, Final Fantasy) and, unexpectedly enough, a bullet-hell shooter. Yes, it is definitely all of those things!ContextJust a little bit of history, this was part of a series of promotional Serious Sam games, created by Devolver Digital to promote the (at the time) upcoming Serious Sam 3.The other game of the series I've played, was a 2D side-scrolling shooter, where you could mount guns on top of other guns, and had massive mobs of enemies exploding around you. It was a blast!With that said, when I saw this available on a sale, I decided to give it a go, as ridiculous as the premise sounds!It's a byte-sized game made by Vlambeer, so you know what to expect, knowing them -- sometimes unfair, yet really fun and chaotic arcade gaming!PresentationThe visual style in this game immediately shows what the game is. It features the indentifiable Vlambeer style, with the whole SS crew of headless guys with bombs for hands and lava monters! I'm not too familiar with the Serious Sam games (I own them, just haven't gotten around to playing them), so I can't say how faithful it may be.Regardless, it looks pretty cool. It's a retro looking and sounding game, but not in a lazy way.You'll literally fight dozens of enemies at once, in each battle, all with a big flare of explosions and bullet flying around. You may argue that it sometimes obfuscates the screen and isn't very clean -- but honestly, that's not the point. It's supposed to be silly, mindless and over-the-top, and that's exactly what it is! In a good way.Each area has a very characteristic look, and it's really great to see hordes of enemies on screen getting obliterated.The music is a bit strange. I can't tell if it's a different and more retro arrangement of SS's music. Regardless I think it's pretty good! Some of it (especially the drumming) sounds like MIDI, and the rest is simply synth based music. It does fit the theme, though! Futuristic levels sound futuristic, egypt level sounds oriental, that sort of stuff. I really enjoyed the music while I played the game!In the way of options and interface, it's a bit limited, but it doesn't really matter very much. I beat the game in less than 2 hours, so there weren't any major problems that I've found worth mentioning.The writing isn't at all serious, being very self aware and constantly poking fun at both SS and JRPG tropes. It was amusing to me, taking the context of the game into account.General StructureIn this game, you have 3 different levels, each with 3 different stages. It plays like a JRPG. You have a topdown view and a small map, sometimes with ""puzzles"" to solve. I say ""puzzles"" but I don't think they count as that. It's more the concept of puzzle that the game uses to poke fun at. Go to A, press switch, door opens -- with guts and explosion in the middle.In these maps, there are, as the name suggests, random encounters!Yes, about every 2 steps. Literally. Don't worry, the maps aren't all that big. At the end of each battle, your characters gain a bit of armor, if they didn't get hit, so it definitely rewards ""decent"" play -- skill isn't a big factor in this game, no worries!You'll have to balance exploration (very minimal, each stage fits easily in one screen) and just rushing to the end. Why? Because there are chests spread around the stages. These chests contain weapons and items that will certainly prove useful. On the downside, you'll have more encounters, which is more dangerous.At the end of each level there's a Boss fight, which mainly involves a big horde plus a really big unique monster.Death is punished, buy it's not too punishing by any stretch. I find it completely fair! You have 3 lives. If you die in any encounter, you'll go back one step behind that encounter, and lose a life. If you lose all your lives, you simply restart the stage. Since the stages are really short, it's never a problem.You start with only one character, but then pick another 2, on later levels.General Mechanics and Combat SystemOk, this is the interesting part of the game, of course! How exactly do they combine JRPG combat with bullet-hells?Well, honestly, not very well, from a design standpoint. It is, however, a fun idea to experiment in a game like this!Basically, it's a turn-based bullet-hell game. The game stops every 5 seconds. When it stops, you get to choose an action. Use an item? Change weapon? Or maybe you'll simply attack. When you attack or change weapon, you'll chosen which direction you'll want to shoot, and that's about it.While it's really simply, conceptually, it has many more ideas thrown in, which I'll talk ahead, regarding weapons. (1)Outside the turn, you basicaly move vertically, trying to shoot your enemies, and dodge bullets (which is worth mentioning by itself (2)). The items aren't very interesting, although they certainly are useful. There are items that heal the party, give them full armor, 4x damage, speed, huge bombs, etc. Nothing very unique, but I'm glad they're there regardless! It adds variety and some degree of tactic to the combat.I think that's enough to give you a general idea of what the game is. Now, I'd like to discuss some aspects that may make-or-end the deal, for you.1.WeaponsFirst off, I'll write about the weapons, since I think it's the coolest aspect of the game. There are several different weapons. And when I say different, I mean different! Not just more powerful, faster, bigger -- they actually feel different, and have mechanics of their own, playing with the turn-based side of the game.For example, there's a Revolver that is a bit weak, but auto-targets close targets, killing them one by one. There's a  Shotgun that shoots only in a certain range that you assign to it when you choose your turn-action -- Trading individual damage for less, spread damage.There's a big Cannon that is piercing and very large shot, basically killing everything in front of it (or the direction you choose) -- however, you always have to wait for a turn for it to recharge! And using items doesn't count.Then, there's a Grenade Launcher and damage a radial area of your choosing.I could go on, but this gets the point across. The weapons are really different from one another, and it adds quite a lot to the combat! It also adds interesting aspects to the weird, unique concept of this game.2. Dodging enemies and bullets with 3 charactersI've talked about my favourite aspect; now it's time for by biggest problem!The game is very unbalanced. Period. There was certainly some thought put into it, since the game is beatable for sure, and item placement helps with that. However, this is a very byte-sized game, and such a thing wouldn't work on a bigger game. But I'm digressing.The point is, when you're in battle, it's almost impossible to dodge enemies and bullets. Your only defense is actually a brutal offense. If you can kill everything before it gets to you, you're in a good spot! Otherwise, you're screwed.I mean, there are 3 characters, with a decent space between them. So, if you want to dodge, you'll have to dodge with all three at once. Besides, with the amount of enemies that there are, you'll often be overwhelmed, at one point or another. It happens a lot, but you can be more prepared on your next try.ConclusionThe game doesn't require a lot of skill, directly because of this. It's a mindless game about slaughtering hordes of enemies at once, with big guns. Still, it's chaotic and fun! If you want a short, little, but mechanically ball-sy game, look no further! It's not perfect, but it has its moments!			",474,130,11,42,29,3,58

												Pretty original title. The game is fairly cheap, and worth every cent. It's a pretty short game, which shouldn't be a deterrent. It's a very fun game. The campaign is around 2 hours long, and provides you with enough insane victories and spectacular defeats. There's also an endless mode, which is very chaotic. If I had to rate game on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give it a solid 8/10. This game is definitely a buy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Heck yeah I like Serious Sam! Only a dollar, effin A.The chest in the corner took me 3 attempts to open. Cool an item, how the hell do I use it? Oh only in battle... and if you sacrafice a character action (which will probably get you killed). Hrm well okay. Battle time... hey I think that went pretty well. It was kinda fun right? (Too bad you get more than one character)Alright badass I get a black dude with a minigun. Wait how do I control him? Oh he moves with Sam, I see. So to dodge bullets I must move two characters at the same time with the same keys. Bleh, okay this seems like it could be a problem ♥♥♥♥♥).Well I guess it's time to fight this big boss whom is on the starting screen. 20 seconds later... BAM owned. 3rd fight.

												Well, it is a neat idea for a Serious Sam game but it's not that fun to play. When I first played it I was happy but as I progressed through the game, it became relentlessly difficult. Also, the game glitches sometimes and it has a few bugs. The game is not good or bad, but it's just challenging and it can be beaten in like an hour, depending on how good you are.

												After you get a third party member, dodging is completely impossible. Very unfair after that and the game is totally ruined for me.

												As a Vlambeer fan, I want to like this game. I just can't. It is a hybrid between a shmup and turn based RPG. It's hard to explain. Basically, you select the gun and the range/aim, and then once your characters shoot, you can move them up or down to dodge bullets or shoot certain monsters. AFter 5 seconds, you get another turn, usually setting up the same shots. It was kind of repetitive. The turns aren't step based, they're time based. You shoot for a few seconds and then go to the next turn. The RPG gameplay is like Pokémon, where every step you take, a monster could randomly appear.I love the artwork, but the gameplay mechanics are just, different. It's not as simple as other Vlambeer games. Try Super Crate Box, that game is the bomb, and it's free. I'd actually pay for it if they decided to charge for it. It has so much more strategy than this.			",347,99,20,34,43,5,38

												Short story: This game is sheitLong story: don't let the names of the developer you know trick you into thinking this game is 'good' it's not. Everytime I try to give this game a chance it just fails horribly.What seems like nice simple game in the beginning quickly and I mean quickly just becomes frustrating bullsheit. As the game just doesn't seem like it is properly playtested and doesn't give you a reasonable chance to beat the game.The gameplay just doesn't work out that well when the number of enemies just overwhelms your ability to fireback enough. Dodging only literially only works within the first couple of minutes because immediately you get an ally that limits your dodging ability. On that note because of having an ally it limits certain weapon ranges. You can't use items outside of combat. Going back to the overwhelming enemies, using items is sometimes a waste of time as say if you use a revive the one using the revive would probably die afterwards thus making it a waste of time.Bottom line The Random Encounter is a sheit game that looks like a decent game.

												Serious Sam: The Random Encounter had massive potential, but the lack of expanded mechanics killed the game.  To be honest Serious Sam: The Random Encounter is super creative in design. It somehow combined classic bullet hell with turned based RPG. Quite a blast to play for a bit, but its problems become very apparent by the end of your first play through. The definition of bullet hell in this game is a giant wall of bullets with no way to dodge. The gameplay is super repetitive and becomes a chore due to little enemy variety. Their sprites look different but their mechanics are the pretty much the same; they run faster, shoot lasers, or explode in to a bloody mess. If you are in the market for games that contain new ideas that have yet to be expanded upon, try this. Just don’t expect much staying power or replay-ability for this game.

												I had just gotten back into Serious Sam after much avoidance. This almost made me decide to change my mind. It's not good. It's almost like someone with no experience with the games other than a trailer decided to write a game to capitalize on the recent resurgence of both Sam and sprite RPGs.Hrm... Almost like that indeed.It's a turn based game with an overhead sprite view and a party of 3 guys. The gimmick is apparently that it's only partially turn based in that you have control to move your party to dodge bullets and enemies. Much like the game proper. Problem is. There's no freedom of movement and at least one member of your party will be hit even in the best of circumstances. I saw someone else say that this is a bullet hell with no way to dodge the bullets and that's pretty much spot on.It's difficult, but not in the way Serious Sam itself is. The game proper is difficult but fair and there's always a way to win. Here it's basically luck and hoping you only get hit by most bullets rather than all of them. Plus the weapons aren't in any way like you'd think.For example, the minigun. In Sam proper do you use it to shoot in a straight line or do you spray back and forth for crowd control? This game seems to think it's the former. The shotgun is probably the most useful hilariously enough because you can use it to shoot down some of the bullets.Nothing else to say really. Croteam should be slightly more paranoid of who they allow to use the franchise name and aesthetic though.			",212,50,0,19,13,1,17

												Quite possibly one of the worst games I've ever played.Now don't get me wrong, the graphics, sound and music are all great and it does a good job of looking like Serious Sam but the game itself is an UTTER JOKE.It professes to be an action twist on a classic turn based RPG combat system but utterly fails on all counts. You're supposed to dodge incoming enemies and attacks while shooting and aiming weapons but every time it adds a new character up to the maximum of 3 you lose 1/3rd of your mobility because you can't go higher or lower than the spread out characters.By the end of the game I was just praying for a lucky streak and hoping to get through the abhorrent last couple of stages so I could delete this poorly thought out garbage from my machine.Thank ♥♥♥♥ that's over, don't buy or play this game.

												This game isn't really Samish. The dungeon styled ""whatever it is called"" gameplay isn't the proper way to create a Sam game.  What's gonna be the next one, Serious Sam: The Ugly Jigsaw Puzzle Encounter? Let's not downgrade the name Serious Sam into something that can be put to anywhere, ok Croteam? Don't let it happen!

												A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little game classified as abandonware because the devs won't fix the crash issue on windows 8 that tons of ppl are having. Some person just released a fix recently and I got to actually play the game thanks to them. It doesn't matter anyway because the game Seriously Sucks like most Serious Sam games do. The difficulty comes from having to use the exact weapons in the exact line during each fight. If you deviate any tiny bit from what the devs had in mind, you die and lose the battle. The game is 100% trial and error hence the reason it blows. You have zero freedom in how you do battle. It is a neat idea pausing and letting you plan a attack every five seconds but too bad that good idea was wasted on this dog sh-t game. Serious Sam games have a very limited fan base, just enough to register as cult status, enough for them to keep making games, although Serious Sam 3 will probably be the last one. I sure as hell hope anyway. The only one that had any style and was at least somewhat fun was 2. SS1 and 3 are two of the worst games ever made, just boring, bland, lifeless slogfests of boredom. This pile of crap is right up there with them. I have zero interest in playing this garbage past the few levels I played. Maybe in the future they will learn their lesson that people want freedom of choice in games, not to have their gameplay choices handcuffed completely.Unfun dog crap garbage abandonware 0/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												This is worth trying if you already own it from a bundle, but it's NOT worth buying. The basic premise of the game is cool, but the way that your characters are all stuck a set distance apart (like they're a row of men on a Foosball table) makes dodging incredibly frustrating, as does locking your angle of fire for each five-second turn. Also there's NO CONTROLLER SUPPORT and Windows 8 users say they can't run it. Although you heal between fights, you can't equip armor or change weapons outside of combat, which adds to the game's needless restrictiveness.It would be a HUGE improvement if they make a sequel where the characters could move independently and aim freely during the battles. And if the enemies got visibly injured to show how low their health was.			",808,284,34,136,92,14,204

												seriously hard. seriously arcadey. seriously worth 5 bucks. then again, other games at this price point probably offer more bang for you buck, but it's a fin, quick diversion that's unique in that it mashes up bullet-hell mechanics with action-rpg gameplay in a turn-based system. it can be restrictive and frustrating though, since the range of motion on the characters is severely limited (and appopriately so, else it would be too easy).it's hard to get into, but just remember that you have items, and you should use them liberally.

												What can SSTRE offer you, my dear reader? Timewise, there’s not much: 2 hours if you’re trying to clown the final boss without using any items - i.e. if you like to die a lot. Yes, three sentences into this review and we’re already at the boss - it’s that short. But there’s a lotta game in those 2 hours, you betcha! This little guy is ripped with gameplay. Consider this: JRPG, shmup, and puzzle all within a glorious 8-bit aesthetic. {The 8-bit/retro motif has come back, and actually been back for so long now that the phrase seems to describe little.} First off, the game is incredibly generous, throwing us into the action with minimal story elements to further bog down an already belief-weary mind.So...There’s a lotta game here. And for those of you who find endless joy in point grinding, this is a great deal for $5. SSTRE puts you on a small map with a few items to collect and lot’s of monsters to dispatch. The “random encounters” work more like minesweeper than FF: moving into certain spaces triggers an encounter. Yet unlike minesweeper, the encounters can’t be avoided - oh and there’s no run option either, mmkay? Vambreem rags on Croteam’s horde shooter by having characters automatically run backwards during combat - now come on, that’s hilarious! Hordes of enemies are, during each 5-second turn, getting closer and closer, some faster than others. A 3-option battle menu appears between each 5-second turn. The choices are limited, but as the writer says “vigor is a byproduct of brevity”. Selecting shoot has your “Sam” fire off his equipped weapon; swapping let’s you change weapons but at the cost of 2 seconds of your 5-second turn - 2 seconds you won’t have when you’re about to be obliterated by dozens of headless suicide bombers; using items is actually pretty ♥♥♥♥ing useful in this game, believe it or not: armor and attack buffs, shmuppy full-screen bombs, and instant full-party revives all seem more essential to combat than the dagone weapons!     Being a short game, weapons are introduced very early. I like that. The variety between the six weapons and their appropriate use pump up the games strategic chops. Earlier I mentioned that the weapons and items were unbalanced and choosing not to rely on the items as much really gives the difficulty a shot in the arm. Behind the weapons and enemies is your basic paper-rock-scissor mechanic. When those suicide bombers come a runnin, get out that minigun and pump em full! Use the grenade launcher on the big boys; and though it’ll cost you a full turn to charge, the cannon is great for taking out hordes of really powerful enemies - just don’t leave anything behind to take you out while recharging the cannon or swapping to a different weapon.     All in all, the game packs three levels. Not too much by any standard, to be sure, but there is some replay value here. Each of your steps is counted toward your score. So, one could play it all again, going for completion with minimal steps. Also, getting to know the different weapons, how they’re used, and who to use them with adds variety to the battles, ensuring you never have the same one twice.			",567,142,9,95,45,5,110

												To be clear and short:This does have Serious Sam in its name, it does have a lot of guns, but DOES NOT LOOK OR RESSEMBLE ANYTHING LIKE SERIOUS SAM!!!Pros:-Fun-Not bad looking-Guns, guns and gunsCons:-Not a Serious sam game, aside from the fact the character is the protagonist-Get boring after 30 minutes-Pokémon-like sudden fights-Can't move 2 blocks without milions of monsters running to you (millions of monsters running to you might be the pros of Serious sam, but this one is just too repetitive)Frankly, this game is not that bad, it is just they gave it a wrong title. You would not call Tomato soup ""Corn soup"" even if the soup was red. They called it Serious Sam just because he was starring it, not because it was an actual Serious Sam game. This is too far from the original games, and thus deserves anothe name, such as ""Big Guns"", or ""Just Shoot It"". I would recommend it to be out of the Serious Sam bundle, to change the character and monster sprite + the game title and you're good to go. And Seriously (pun intended), this is not that of a bad game in a way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I cannot recomend this game due to technical reasons.The game itself is incredibly fun, very fast paced, challangeing and basicly everything I like about a good game.But given the fact, that Microsoft forces WIndows 8.1 onto everything and anything and the Devs behind SS:Random Encounter apperently did not see the need to patch this game, which is completly unplayable on Windows 8 and 8.1 really makes me sad.Because I WANT to play this game and I gladly gave the Devs my money for it... But Windows 8 has been out for a long time now and still there were no intentions to fix this issue that renders a otherwise great and fun game unplayable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For me, the reason why I'm saying no is because Vlambeer left the game behind to do mobile games and other games, as well as certain game iussues which I haven't the mispleasure to encounter, as were this game doesn't work on Windows and above, which I learned the hard way after buying. I know this may seem like a short review, it is. Vlambeer left this game, with so much potenital in the state it's in. The difficulty spike, from what I've seen, is that of some terribly made game which expects the player to be so good after beating the first world, which would make some yell swears at the game. As well as the difficulty spike, at the end of the game, from what I've seen, after the last boss kills you, you're greeted with the normal ""Game Over/You have Died"" screen, but from that screen, you can't retry the stage, you're stuck in Game Over limbo until you restart the game from a save right before the boss and you can try to hope that you don't mess up and after a while, it will seem more like a nuiscance to even deal with this game anymore. So in short, the game is a bit wonky on some computers, and even in game. So please, if you're running Windows Seven, go ahead, but if not, I'd have it in my best opinion that you spend your money on hats or even something else.			",187,17,1,21,11,3,13

												What can SSTRE offer you, my dear reader? Timewise, there’s not much: 2 hours if you’re trying to clown the final boss without using any items - i.e. if you like to die a lot. Yes, three sentences into this review and we’re already at the boss - it’s that short. But there’s a lotta game in those 2 hours, you betcha! This little guy is ripped with gameplay. Consider this: JRPG, shmup, and puzzle all within a glorious 8-bit aesthetic. {The 8-bit/retro motif has come back, and actually been back for so long now that the phrase seems to describe little.} First off, the game is incredibly generous, throwing us into the action with minimal story elements to further bog down an already belief-weary mind.So...There’s a lotta game here. And for those of you who find endless joy in point grinding, this is a great deal for $5. SSTRE puts you on a small map with a few items to collect and lot’s of monsters to dispatch. The “random encounters” work more like minesweeper than FF: moving into certain spaces triggers an encounter. Yet unlike minesweeper, the encounters can’t be avoided - oh and there’s no run option either, mmkay? Vambreem rags on Croteam’s horde shooter by having characters automatically run backwards during combat - now come on, that’s hilarious! Hordes of enemies are, during each 5-second turn, getting closer and closer, some faster than others. A 3-option battle menu appears between each 5-second turn. The choices are limited, but as the writer says “vigor is a byproduct of brevity”. Selecting shoot has your “Sam” fire off his equipped weapon; swapping let’s you change weapons but at the cost of 2 seconds of your 5-second turn - 2 seconds you won’t have when you’re about to be obliterated by dozens of headless suicide bombers; using items is actually pretty ♥♥♥♥ing useful in this game, believe it or not: armor and attack buffs, shmuppy full-screen bombs, and instant full-party revives all seem more essential to combat than the dagone weapons!     Being a short game, weapons are introduced very early. I like that. The variety between the six weapons and their appropriate use pump up the games strategic chops. Earlier I mentioned that the weapons and items were unbalanced and choosing not to rely on the items as much really gives the difficulty a shot in the arm. Behind the weapons and enemies is your basic paper-rock-scissor mechanic. When those suicide bombers come a runnin, get out that minigun and pump em full! Use the grenade launcher on the big boys; and though it’ll cost you a full turn to charge, the cannon is great for taking out hordes of really powerful enemies - just don’t leave anything behind to take you out while recharging the cannon or swapping to a different weapon.     All in all, the game packs three levels. Not too much by any standard, to be sure, but there is some replay value here. Each of your steps is counted toward your score. So, one could play it all again, going for completion with minimal steps. Also, getting to know the different weapons, how they’re used, and who to use them with adds variety to the battles, ensuring you never have the same one twice.			",567,142,9,95,45,5,110

												seriously hard. seriously arcadey. seriously worth 5 bucks. then again, other games at this price point probably offer more bang for you buck, but it's a fin, quick diversion that's unique in that it mashes up bullet-hell mechanics with action-rpg gameplay in a turn-based system. it can be restrictive and frustrating though, since the range of motion on the characters is severely limited (and appopriately so, else it would be too easy).it's hard to get into, but just remember that you have items, and you should use them liberally.

												A Random Encounter RPG with final fantasy style battles and movement during your turn. You choose which weapons you use for your party, which are all iconic weapons from the first and second encounters, and then the range or cone of fire, and let her rip. The only problem I've encountered so far is frequent crashes during gameplay not allowing me to progress very far. A definite try for any fans of the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun simple action RPG with good pixel art.  If you ever wanted a pixel art game with Serious Sam IP this is it.  Controls leave a bit to be desired and theres no feedback for movement in combat, no variance with which the characters move across the 2.5D scrolling combat field.  No native controller support.  The weapons system and mechanics dont feel fleshed out and the enemies tend to create a kind of bullet hell side scrolling situation.  This game actually plays a lot like a turn based Raiden except in landscape instead of portrait orientation.  If you like serious sam and want a chuckle, this game might be worth your time.  If you don't like half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥pixel games stay away.Only buy this game if its on sale for a quarter. ",197,16,2,26,15,1,30

												The most realistic and the most complicated experience you may ever have. This game is a once in a generation game. It has the most outstanding plot and graphics also dialogs are fairly detailed. One of the best first person role playing indie strategie third person shooter second person puzzle action adventure game I have ever seen. No jokes...			",86,9,1,17,5,0,11

												The game is not a bad one and was enjoying it during the first level and than crash. I never figured out how to save so having to start over multiple times is just annoying.  I kept playing the first level a few times after that but it always ended with a crash before i could reach the level boss.  Don't get this game because it is basically unplayable.

												Unplayable on Windows 8.1, crashes constantly. Still, what I was able to play was a pretty enjoyable 20 minutes session of turn-based action with a nice twist. Not going to happen, but if it was updated to support win8 i´d rebuy it without a doubt.Quite a shame			",64,23,0,7,2,2,4
