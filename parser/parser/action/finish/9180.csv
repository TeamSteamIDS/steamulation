												This pack doesn't include Commander Keen 6 and Keen dreams is missing. Some people have been disappointed because those games weren't included, so be aware! Don't get this pack if you’re  planning on playing Keen 6 and Keen dreams.This review is mainly pointed towards Commander Keen 5: The Armageddon Machine, because I played the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it when I was a kid. I remember getting this game from my uncle on a floppy disk, I took the disk home and installed it, with difficulty, back then I didn't knew much about computers. I finally managed to install it and then I started playing, and I was blown away because the game was so ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. I loved messing around in the levels and exploring them, I died a lot because this was the first real game I played on PC, then I discovered this strange option called 'save' and it remembered where I was! English isn't my native language so I had trouble understanding some parts of the game. I still remember the big red guy with the automatic rifle who instantly killed you when you were in his sights, when I first encountered him I literally jumped out of my chair, I had never seen something so frightening. And eventually I was there, the final level, I remember every second of that remarkable level and when I finished the level and I had beaten Commander Keen 5: The Armageddon Machine, I felt great I had conquered this beast of a game. After beating the game I spent hours upon hours replaying the levels and playing pong. Later I found out that if you pressed F1 (or some other button I don't really remember), the game would load a page with the LORE of Commander Keen 5: The Armageddon Machine, the ♥♥♥♥ing Lore of  Commander Keen 5: The Armageddon Machine, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ And when I found the 'lore' I looked at the pictures of all the enemies I had encountered and I even saw pictures of enemies I didn't encounter, because you could only encounter those on hard mode. (I just looked at the pictures and because at the time I didn't speak a word English.)Years later I found out Commander Keen was available on steam and I had some money on my steam wallet and I was like: ♥♥♥♥ it I'm buying Commander Keen. And I was able to play my childhood love yet again.Well enough of MY experiences with the game, lets actually talk about the game. It's a miracle if you actually read my story and made it so far!Commander keen is simple platformer, it's about a guy, Keen. From my current understanding he is just a dude who travels to random planets and shoots aliens  with his little laser gun, he also has a pogo stick which makes him jump higher. This pack included Keen 1,2,3,4 and 5. The first ones look really old, but the fourth and the fifth looked a lot cleaner and a lot newer.  All of the games play pretty similarly and have the game character and weapons. But I didn’t really finish any other Keen game except Keen 5, so I might be wrong because some things are different later in game. But in Commander Keen 5 you have to collect four diamonds to open doors to continue within the level, then you have to find a key that opens the door to the end of the level, later you have to destroy something what looks like the power source for the space ship you are stranded on. In the game you will encounter various enemies, some are robots some are 'energy enemies', the robots can be killed the 'energy enemies' can only be stunned or can't get hit at all. You have one life, so if you get hit once you are done for, yet you can save everywhere you want, so that isn't a big problem or a hard part about this game. All in all it’s just an old school platformer, that is as unforgiving as any other old game and needless to say the game is also very fun!After playing this game again after so many years, it made me realize that Commander Keen 4 is way superior to Commander Keen 5, because the fourth installment had way more variety. And when I look back at the levels of Commander Keen 5 I realized that they game wasn't really that special. It was just the fact that it was the first game I ever played and finished, what made it so great. The nostalgia made me love this game.Nostalgia is a ♥♥♥♥♥.Thanks for taking the time to read my game review of Commander Keen, one of my favorite games if not my favorite game of all time!

												BETTER THAN MASS EFFECTCommander Keen saved Earth a generation before Commander Shepard ever heard of the Reapers. Little dude built his own space ship out of soup cans. Shepard struggled building a fish tank. This 8 year-old kid was clearing out the Vorticon home planet while Shepard was telling everyone what his favorite shop on the Citadel was.Shepard is a joke.

												Commander Keen is a super retro game made by the creators of Doom(way before), a kinda cool reminder of how games once were. It's a Mario style platformer where you jump around collecting coins, avoiding/attacking enemies and traps, you also have a gun you can shoot. Commander Keen is not for the impatient gamer, this game is of a different time and needs to be respected. Expect ridged controls and somewhat convoluted menu navigation, and a totally nonsensical narrative plot. I'd give it 6.5/10 today, but 8.5/10 for people who can appreciate how it was in those days.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This ""Complete Pack"" contains the first five full Keen titles, excluding Keen Dreams and Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter! probably due to publishing rights issues. Commander Keen in Marooned on Mars:The first entry into the series, and a very enjoyable one. The difficulty isn't too high or too low, just about right; it's short and sweet. Even though there is a tad bit of input lag regarding controls, it never really makes you perform pixel-perfect jumps or anything that difficult. And despite the lack of music and somewhat annoying sound FX, the title still retains a lot of its original charm. Commander Keen in The Earth Explodes:Out of the original trilogy, this is my least favorite one. Why? Because it's basically the first one, but quickly loses its charm when the unfair gameplay kicks in. And I don't mean ""unfair"" as in ""challenging"", I mean unnecessarily aggravating. This is due to the tad bit of input lag, bull**** level design, and annoying enemy AI. Thanks for that John Carmack.Commander Keen in Keen Must Die!:This entry is even more unforgiving than the second, and the lack of music and sound FX REALLY wears on you by now. Why isn't it my least favorite? The main antagonist. Without spoiling anything, the main antagonist and his simple (yet relatable) backstory make the game worth seeing through to the end, and you barely even learn anything about him until the boss fight, which luckily, isn't too hard. I'll just say... it shows a lot of humility for id Software, considering how they went on to turn the entire industry upside down multiple times.Commander Keen in Secret of the Oracle:This is probably my favorite Keen title, why? Well, one reason is Dopefish's glorious debut. Another is how nearly every aspect of Keen was improved vastly. This is when the Keen series felt much more like a fully-formed franchise rather than a labor of love from a group of eager programmers. The graphics are much more colorful and cartoony, the gameplay is MUCH more fluid and MUCH less aggravating, and there is actual background music that’s catchy and makes the experience more enjoyable. And you can't forget Dopefish, we will never forget Dopefish. Commander Keen in The Armageddon Machine:A lot like Secret of the Oracle, except new levels, music, easter eggs, and sadly leaves on a big cliffhanger, and I only mention this because the sixth title is not included leaving you to find it yourself. Still a lot of fun and pretty enjoyable. The only nitpick I really have is how you actually beat the game, as it is very confusing and very hard to actually figure out how to blow the last fuse. Otherwise, a solid Keen title.Some people complain on how ""You're paying for an emulator!"" or ""It's missing two episodes!” I really don't. This is the bulk of a classic series, and you're paying how much? Five dollars? And you'll probably wait for a sale anyway, won't you. You should be grateful it's even on Steam for legitimate purchase. Also, the games run almost flawlessly in DOSBox for me at least, unlike many other DOS games released on Steam packaged with DOSBox...If you want to explore id's past, want to dive into another retro platformer, or simply just bored, buy the pack now for five bucks. Don't even wait for a sale, it's not really worth waiting for when you could be playing now.EDIT: If you would like to see a full release of Keen Dreams on Steam (w/ Achievements, Leaderboards, and other Steam features) running natively on Windows and Linux PC's, click here to check out this new source port:I even made the trailer on the Steam page you see there.Maybe this could prompt id Software to do a similar overhaul with this release.

												One of the first games I ever played, so I was glad to find it on Steam.It's a nice platformer, but can't do much more than jump and shoot straight forward. Try to avoid the gaps and collect as many points as you can (not as easy as it sounds mind you ;) ) Since everything kills you in one hit, prepare to start some levels over and over again. But considering the age of this game, it's still very entertaining (come on you know you love MS-Dos)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being one of the first games, I ever played, Commander Keen is the PC equivalent of Super Mario. You jump, run and shoot your way through 2D levels, avoiding traps, gaps and monsters.Being an oldschool game, the difficulty is sometimes a little bit silly.While 4, 5 and 6 had mid save options, in 1 - 3 you could only save in the main area, not inside levels. Combined with nearly unkillable powerjumping...we called them Zombie kangaroos...this game is quite a number of difficulty.After the 4th part you also got a difficulty option, that enables traps and increase the amount of monsters.Beside that, the game has a little ongoing story about the main character, explaining him and why he is doing all that (genius child, build a blaster and a rocket ship with parts of his familys home).(PS: Every game has at least one hidden area and level)The bad part about the bundle (yes its 5 games in one), that it is missing the last 2 games. 6 was a special limited edition (who limits a game???) and 7...we dont talk about 7.The story doesnt end with 6 or 7 ether, so fans made Keen 7 (denying the existence of the real keen 7), Keen 8 and Keen 9, who look quite decent and end the Keen story for good. Check it out on Youtube.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I jumped into this bundle of games wearing the thickest of nostalgia goggles. Keeping that in mind, it's still quite a landmark in videogame history as one of the first games with seamless scrolling stages (which was new for PC's at the time). It's also a great game for aspiring game developers, the first two levels in ''Keen Must Die"" are a classic example of interesting level design, teaching the player not to trust their environment or the way items are distributed through the stage.However, the game does suffer of serious feedback issues, sluggish controls and a difficulity level that reaches the end of an asymptote. Overall a must play, for those that like to learn more about ID (APOGEE)'s early titles and platforming from the early 90's.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Finally!! These games are amazing though! You play as Keen, equipped with a gun and a pogo stick. You collect candy and keys to advance the levels. Map is opened up similar to that of Mario World, which is a time tested winner.These games aren't just good for the 90's; they are still really fun! This is an amazing deal to get 5 games for $5! You should buy this for sure.Worth the $20... but it's only $5 Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												A simple platformer with excellent design, Commander Keen, developed by id sofware, was revolutionary in it's day and was the first action sidescroller on PC. It features large, non-linear levels in which you need to navigate to the exit, which is most likely blocked off by a door requiring a key which is hidden on the map somewhere. The levels get more complex and the design gets crazier as the game progresses along with gaining difficulty as you'd expect. Overall this is a solid platformer, even by todays standards, it offers great gameplay, great design and a lot of replay value, this comes with 5 Commander Keen games, so instead of paying 15$ for some indie platformer that tries to mimmick games of Commander Keen's era, get the real McCoy! Works with controller.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, let me start this review out by saying this: Steam royally screwed up what could have ben an awesome product. There is just not enough reason to justify this purchase when it is the bare minimum of what could have been done to make this a working game. The Commander Keen series is an amazing set of games, a piece of the history of PC gaming, and Steam treated this piece of history like most people treat their garbage.To elaborate,  Commander Keen was the first PC game to have Parallax scrolling, the same kind of scrolling that Super Mario uses to be able to have a Platformer. At the time, it was a huge deal to have the entire level not be a single screen. So Commander Keen was produced to prove that a PC could support a full Platformer of many screens and levels. The game has an overworld and lets you play levels in any order, you get to shoot enemies from a distant and it is also the Nintendo Hard you would expect from a classic game, so it should be a dream for people who wish to visit a time when 2D was king. To neglect this classic trilogy and the 2/3rds of a trilogy sequel would be a shame.Now, I am not suggesting you buy this pack. Especially if you don't know the series already. This pack is a bare minimum attempt at a quick buck off of some old shareware games.  Yes, you heard me, SHAREWARE. If you are not aware, due to age or not being a PC gamer until after Floppy Disks disappeared, Shareware was the precursor to Playable Demo games on services such as Playstation Network, X-Box Live Arcade and yes, even Steam, where you would get a part of the game on a floppy disk at no charge, to try out. In the main menu, you would often see an ""Order Now!"" or ""Ordering Details"" option that let you buy the full game's disk for a reasonable sum of money. It spread the word of companies and got them some revenue as well as positive customer feedback that people were willing to pay money for their ideas.So, since the game (well Commander Keen 1 and Commander Keen 4 are Shareware, at least) is technically free, you would think that this pack would do something more to make you want to buy it, right? Well, you'd be wrong. In fact, this pack is actually more of a hassle than going out and downloading Commander Keen 1, 2, 3 and 4 and a DOSBox Emulator yourself. To access any game past Commander Keen 1, you have to open up your Steam window, go into your library and launch it from there. Double Clicking the Shortcut that is generated on the desktop does nothing more than launch the first game. Not even a hastily slapped together Commander Keen selection menu screen comes up, just the default steam menu with radial buttions even after going through the hassle.So I suggest to you to save your money, go get a DOSBox Emulator, and download Commander Keen 1 to try out. You don't have to send any money and it is legal because that's how the game was released back in the day. And if you go and get the non-shareware games? Well, it's not like ID software is going to come after you for picking up a title that they don't even have the rights to anymore. Though, the one thing this pack does RIGHT is that Commander Keen 5: The Armageddon Machine has it's copy protection (having one of the items you need to complete the level not spawn at all, making the second level impossible to complete) set to working properly as if you bought the game.

												A nice retro platformer that stands up very well when compared to most of the newer games of it's genre. This game is especially great when you played it as a kid, and find out that it's still a very good game (as in my case).Pros.Solid platformingChallenging levelsDifferent difficulty levelsSteam has the whole series, except for 3.5 and 6 (which is no real loss, IMO)Option to turn off the musicCons.Those gorram dragonfly thingsMusic is god-awfulAgain, if you're looking for 5 relatively short (albeit really difficult), retro experiences, definitely try this one out!PS. My play time says 5 hours, which is my play time since I owned the game in my account (I was family sharing a friend's copy previously)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PC kids of the 90's didn't have Mario or Sonic, they had Keen. Football helmet, pogo stick, and attitude.Commander keen is the story of Billy Blaze, a kid who manages to figure out space travel and therefore take on an alternate identity keen. He starts off crashing on mars, and goes through many platforming adventures there looking for parts to rebuild his spaceship. The levels are full of obstacles and collectibles, as well as very exotic alien races bent on touching and therefore killing you.The game is slower paced than other console platformers, but it charges you with finding keys to progress through its levels, and navigate complex terrain via pogo stick.It is a fun, but quite old series of games. For people who like old style platformers with some imagination. Its a good time waster, and doesn't require the same raw platforming skills of a mario game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Commander Keen is, quite simply put, a masterpiece of the early 90's PC sidescrolling platform genre. Challenging yet fun gameplay that features bouncing around on a pogo stick and zapping aliens with a raygun, what more could you ask for?Unfortunately, despite it being called the ""complete pack"", it only contains the first five episodes, 'Aliens Ate My Babysitter' and 'Keen Dreams' are sadly missing from this collection. Still, despite their age, the games that come with this pack are still fun to play, and it's very highly reccommended to people who love platformers or grew up in the DOS era of PC gaming. 4.0/5.0			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before I start this review, it should be noted that in recent years Steam did something that made dosbox crash upon clicking the play button. Here is the simple solution I came up with to run the game, that has worked for a number of people. Sadly, you will need to do this for each keen game. But they follow the same path. Enjoy!Solution to get the game running:Look for the [keen(#).conf] file in C:Program Files>Steam>SteamApps>common>Commander Keen>base(#)>Open it up with notepad or notepad+ and change the output=overlay (This works on most computers, but there is an occasional card/driver combo that won't. If it doesn't then try opengl or openglnb.) Now just hit file>save and you're done. The game should run now.Solution to getting the game running at the optimium screen resolution:If your game is having issues with the screen being stretched or really small, you want want to edit some other values in the keen.conf file. This would be changing fullscreen=true, fulldouble=true, and fullresolution=[your screen's resolution]Eg. fullresolution=1366x768 (When I first got the game it was running super wide and some of the game was cut off)I have tried to make this as clear as possible, but if you still have questions, feel free to ask!Review:I have loved this game from the time I was a little lad. It is a really fun platformer with a pretty silly story! The pack includes the first five games of the series, but not the 6th or keen dreams. The 4th game ""Secret of the Oracle"" is my absolute favorite. Great story, mechanics, and art. I mean, come on! With a blaster and pogo stick, what more could a kid want (No aliens were harmed in the making of this game...ok maybe a few). The game shows a little age (especially the first few). Definitely a must have if you played the games before, but even if you haven't I think the game is worth it, although I'm a little bias.""The dopefish lives""Check out my other adventure reviews on my page!

												This review is in ""English/Portuguese""English:Ok.... ummmm, how can i explain this for the newcomers?Ok, let's go... Well, this game actually ""could"" have been exclusivity of Nintendo, yes, you read it right, but, the producers ""John Carmack"" and ""John Romero"" tried to sell the idea to the big company and they were refused, told that the PCs didn't had a future (i imagine that it wouldn't have a future only inside Nintendo hehehe), and since they wanted to prove them wrong, they created this game, Commander Keen, that has became an Hype on PC, being something like a ""Rival"" of the same level of quality of Mario... In the PC...Well, forgive my history lessons, this game is very good! But it is old, veeeeeery old! So, he is more a way to travel though time for those who don't know how old games are like, and also it servers has away to remember the old times, for the more ""experienced"" gamers.This game surely worth it's price! And has any classic game, it is a MUST for anyone that would like to have a collection of games, and with such a beautifull background, why would you refuse?Ps: It is good to remind that ""John Carmack"" and ""John Romero"" were the heart of ID Software, and Doom, the father of shooters...Ps²: In my humble opinion ""John Romero"" is one of the biggest master of videogames, related to my favorite game, Deus Ex (1).Portuguese:Ok... ummmm, como eu vou explicar isso para os novatos?Vamos lá... Bom este jogo na verdade ""poderia"" ter sido exclusividade da Nintendo, sim, você leu certo, porém, os produtores ""John Carmack"" e ""John Romero"" tentaram vender a idéia para a grande empresa e lhes foram recusadas, dizendo que PCs não teriam futuro (eu imagino que não teria futuro apenas dentro da Nintendo hehehe), e como eles queriam prova o contrário, criaram este jogo, Commander Keen, que se tornou um Hype no PC, sendo algo como um ""Rival"" de igual para igual de Mario... No Pc...Ok, agora chega de lição de história, o jogo é muito bom! Mas, é velho, beeeeeem velho, então ele serve como uma viagem no tempo para quem não conhece jogos antigos, e serve como meio de reviver os velhos tempos para os ""Experientes"".Vale sim a pena este jogo, e como todo clássico, é um MUST para quem faz coleções de games, e como uma história tão bonita, porque você se recusaria?Obs: Vale lembrar que ""John Carmack"" e ""John Romero"" foram o coração da ID Software, e Doom, o pai dos shooters...Obs²: Na minha humilde opinião""John Romero"" é um dos maiores mestres de jogos, relacionado ao meu game predileto, Deus Ex (1).

-Quick Review-Commander Keen Complete Pack is a DOS platformer from the 1990's by Apogee Software (now known as 3D Realms). While the game is very much focused on being an arcade platformer game, the designers included a story explaining what was going on within the game... Interested? Read on.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Billy Blaze is your standard 8 year old boy, by standard we mean he making his own unraveling adventure in space, starting off with fighting the Vorticons and saving planet earth, then receiving news of a new threat to the Galaxy Keen rushes off to consult the Keepers of the Oracle.It is worth noting for die-hard-Commander-Keen Fans, that not all games are present: 1 Marooned on Mars. 2 The Earth Explodes. 3 Keen Must Die! 4 Secrets of the Oracle. 5 The Armageddon Machine. are available in the Commander Keen Complete Pack.Game Play: It has already been established that the Commander Keen Complete Pack is a platformer, but in addition to standard movement controls you have a laser gun, and a Pogo Stick (being the signature item of the franchise). You can jump, and the Pogo stick gives you even higher jumps. When I was little, no one in my family knew what this game was called. So we called lovingly called it ""Pogo""!In Addition to the movement features of the game, there are various ""accessory"" items that help you unlock different levels, or unlock doors within a level. While in many of the games there are levels and extra's you can skip over, trying to track down all the secrets in these games really increases it's replay-ability. (Hey, keep in mind this is a DOS game developed in the 1990's, the fact that this type of game is still fun to play is pretty impressive)Achievements: There are no achievements in the Commander Keen games, however there are High Scores. As with very old classic Arcade games; you would try to get the highest score and then put in perverted messages to the poor souls who never had the mad skills you did.Price The Commander Keen Complete Pack is priced at $4.99, if you sit down and actually play the game you can easily get more then 4 hours worth of game play, the games have a really nice combination of difficulty, exploration, platforming and secret area's.*Graphics Graphics is a NEW category that I'm adding exclusively for this particular review. I don't personally care about graphics in video games, I feel that bad mechanics (or Game Play) speak stronger then if you're seeing every poly in the character. But I want to emphasis that this is an old game, so if you do intend to get it without having any internal motivation, keep in mind this is a game LOOKS, SOUNDS, and often times FEELS old.*Nostalgia Nostalgia is a NEW category that I'm adding exclusively for this particular review. I think it's pretty safe to say that 90% of the people who have played and/or reviewed this game are all motivated by the same thing: This is a game of our past. For me personally this was the first PC Game *I ever played*. Nearly the first game in general, but Super Mario Land for the Gameboy takes first place.If you want to take a step back and know what type of game I was playing when I was a little kid, go ahead and buy this game, then let me know what you thought about it!Conclusion: Do I recommend... or not recommend... that is the question. Most people will pass up this game, and that's fine. It probably only appeals to gamers who enjoy Platformers, or those of us who played this game when we were little.I am going to recommend this game to people who enjoy platformers, specifically Commander Keen 4 ""Secrets of the Oracle"", the earlier games are more of a novelty, while still often times difficult, I personally preferred Commander Keen 4 and 5, to the original Trilogy.

												The Keen Complete Pack is a pretty fantastic set of platformers from way back in the early 90s that has aged gracefully and will provide a lot of bang for your buck. All 5 episodes run fine on modern machines (at time of typing of course) and while the first three can be a little obscure to someone unused to the predecessors of today's platformers, they combine an occasionally ferocious level of difficulty with the playfulness of a different gaming era. Easter eggs and secrets are bountiful and I found myself smiling on many occasions as I pogoed through the days of yore. Don't even worry about sales and pick this one up at $5; if you enjoy platforming and don't mind a slightly aged experience you will not regret it.Oh, and keep an eye out for the Dopefish!

												Commander Keen is one of the earlier non-sports titles by ID Software (creators of DOOM) and is a childhood treasure of mine. Without going into detail, Commander Keen is a simplistic sidescroller in which you collect candy and kill aliens. These days it often difficult to find entertainment out of such a simple game, but if you are on a pilgrimage to find ancient games or simply enjoy the retro, 8-bit style, Commander Keen will be an enjoyable experience for you. P.S. The Galactic Alphabet used in Commander Keen has become a cult iconic language, appearing in many games since, including being featured as the enchanting language in Minecraft.

												Golden Platformers...if only all 7 were together.So before I begin, this pack is missing two games:  Keen Dreams and Commander Keen 6: Aliens Ate my Babysitter.  I know there's legal reasons behind the games being absent, but it would have been nice.Before they unveiled DOOM and changed the video gaming industry forever, the creative folk at Id put together these humorous and quirky platformers.  All five CK games are brilliant in their layout and execution, but they're also hard (4 & 5 have an easy, normal, or hard setting while 1, 2, & 3 don't).  Any platformer or retro game fan needs to buy this pack.  It's basically $1/game and Keen 4 & 5 are WELL worth $5 each.  You owe it to yourself to watch the silly story unfold and enjoy the silly 1991 humor the game brings to the table, and since this uses DosBox's emulator, the music (only in 4 & 5) is also fun to listen too!

												Commander Keen was one of the first and still one of the only very artfully done 2D+ (there are passages through walls and moving platforms) platformers. It is actually a rather challenging game for a few reasons. Most of the levels are large and you have the real possibility when falling down into the unknown of landing on an enemy or lava or spikes, as you may expect. Everything that kills you does it in one hit, there are no life points, it's just that these aliens have some crazy microbiotic make up that you cannot survive at all. So often does a game with this makeup become uninteresting and too difficult. But the crazy-happy appearance of the game kind of keeps you drawn to it. Secondly, the puzzles are difficult but not at all beyond reason. Overall a much cooler platform experience than most of the new attempts at this genre. Though actually the genre itself is pretty much a closed chapter in gaming to some degree. Very well done game for it's time, and still very awesome in its fully functional and entertaining and zany way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An old classic game series made by ID software and published by apogee which admittingly i wasted way too much time on as a kid. This pack features 5 games made by ID software and for the current price it's almost a give-away.Qua controls it can be challenging at various times so be patient with this part you can definatly get the hang of it, The keys are for the rest simple and straight forwarded though the pogostick is the hardest of all to control. Give it some time even i had problems with it when i fired the game back up after so many years.For those familiar with the keen series it should be noted that the commander keen complete series for steam does not contain all the official games but instead only the games made by ID software and apogee. For more details here is a small list:======Included:1. 1 Marooned on Mars1. 2 The Earth Explodes1. 3 Keen Must Die2. 1 Secret of the Oracle2. 2 The armageddon machine======Not included:The Lost Episode aka keen dreams (softdisk)Aliens Ate My Babysitter (formgen)Commander keen Gameboy color (David A. Palmer Productions)With all that out of the way i'd like to mention one more thing before i end this review. Ever heard of the term: Dopefish Lives? Perhaps you've seen an easter egg of it in one of your favorite games or childhood cartoons even. If you do this is where it all started. Go ahead and play the secret of the oracle, it will find you eventually ;)All the best!(s.i.e)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That was my favorite episode growing up. And they DON'T have it in here... Something about publishing or licensing issues or something that does make sense... but is still kinda lame.

												Commander Keen games are PC-MSDOS classic 2D platformers, that came from the days when PC gaming wasn't really considered a serious competention to what 8-bit consoles offered. Unlike many trash that PC had at that time, Commander Keen managed to stand out, having both techincal advance (smooth scrolling on EGA) and a solid game design, almost on same level as many console platformers. Who doesn't like idea of little kid genius zapping his way through alien worlds?Now, as that's quite an old game, how does it stands in modern age in Steam? Simple. Is supplied ""as is"" on DosBox. No trading cards, achievements or Steam Overlay (unless reconfigured). But hey, who doesn't enjoyes reading ordering info, which feels like using time machine, dreaming about ordering a demo version of CK 6 for only 3 dollars?Now, ID managed to screw this up with their DosBox configuration files. While the games run fine in windowed mode, in full-screen it becomes real choppy. It can be easily fixed by changing video output in ""dosbox.conf"" or just by outright deleting this file!As of ""Complete Pack""... it's not exactly complete. For it misses 2 Commander Keen games: ""Keen in Dreams"" (or CK 3.5) and ""CK 6"". You see, at the moment, other companies own publishing rights on those, so iD couldn't include them here. Keen in Dreams is actually a shareware, freely and legaly available for free, so you can just download it from Internet. Now, Commander Keen 6 is not shareware, and from what I heard, it's almost impossible to obtain it legally by nowadays. At least you can download a 3-level demo of it.All of them use the latest ID's patched versions. Also worth noting are that CK 1 and 4 are free shareware games, so you pay only for CK 2, 3 and 5, pretty much.Now games themselves... CK 1, 2 and 3 are part of the first trilogy, the connection being usage of same game engine. They sport a quite simplistic 2D look, which will make some people nose-bleed nostalgia, as well as using PC Speaker for sound, lacking music. It's notable for being one of first games that had a smooth scrolling for EGA... As well as having white-skinned hero, due to color limit. The games always start in outworld map, where you freely control Keen, entering mandatory and optional levels that may block your way, where you will spend time getting to the exit, finding keys to doors, exploring additional areas that may be both helpful or be just enemy-fest with no good bonuses, and just blasting baddies away, wasting precious ammo. With bonus placements, that you aren't even sure if it's possible to get them all. It also had saving... You could save only on outworld map, so you still had to reastart levels from beggining everytime you died. You could easily increase amount of lives by just collecting al the items that give score points. And with 1-hit death, you sure will have to be careful, as this game is not for impatient gamers.One of interesting things about them is pogo-stick, which Keen finds in CK 1 (with your help) and keeps for the rest of the series. Usage of it makes player bounce off floor constantly, making them jump higher as well, with downside being that it's much less controllable. Then again, even normal jumping doesn't have usual perfect controlling, as Keen has tiny delay before jumping. Feels nice though.Another big thing Keen has is exploration... Keen 1 is taking place on Mars and has a good amount of levels, with only 4 of them being required to beat, in any order, as well as few path-blocking levels. The difficulty is not too high there. Keen 2 sends you onto huge space-ship, where you have to beat around 9 levels, with only small amount of optional levels. It's notable for it's level design, having slight puzzle elements, as often you can't just rush head on onto guards of each cannon. Fun stuff, and you can accidently blow up Earth, whoops. Keen 3 on other had is a total mess! While the setting of alien planet is much more interesting than spaceships, level design fails into mud. It's quite strange, as it has only 1 mandatory level, with 2 levels blocking your path, so it can be speedrun easily, skipping all difficult optional levels. It also was quite rushed, which you will feel a lot in levels... Even on latest version of Keen, there are few impossible to reach section, like normal exit in Cave level being blocked. Yes, it's one of mandatory levels, and the only way to beat it is secret exit!Now, CK 4 and CK 5 are part of second ""trilogy"", with CK 6 (Or ""special episode"") being left out of party. Graphics, while stayed at EGA, got a huge boost, giving more depth to the levels by showing top and right sides of walls. It naturally means that most of hidden tunnels are placed on hidden sides of walls, ha. As well as it finally got support for SoundBlaster, meaning also that this time around it features music by Bobby Prince. Not, not Doom-style rock. It's more of usual platformer fare, only a bit weirder. Control were changed around as well, becoming more responsible around this time. Keen is able to climb poles. No more delay before jump, pogo seems to be more controllable, and Keen is now able to grab for the ledge of the platform when not pogo-jumping, making normal jumping useful as well. Nice!. You can as well look up and down now, and I tell you, this game will make you use it, a lot. Another thing, is inclusion of 3 difficulty levels, which change amount of enemies and which turrets are active. Game also seem to get a boost in difficulty. (Also... paddle wars, anybody?)Funny thing, is that they mention ""Impossible Pogo Trick"" in Help, making this glitch pretty much official, and even making use of it in Commander Keen 5. Makes me thing of all bunny-hopping and strafe-jumping in Quake, glitches that became a common practise.It became harder to get lifes by just collecting scores, as for each new life you need as much as double of amount of collected scores... But worry not, new items were introduced, collecting 100 of which gives you a new life. You can also save anywhere you wish this time around, screwing whole life system completely too... ...Talking about dieing, it's fun how Keen would often keep bouncing off hazards when he is already ""dead"". Fun stuff.Commander Keen 4 once again allows a good freedom for exploration as you explore nature of another weird planet in order to save 7 councils. While there aren't many of optional levels, it's still nice to see that most of levels in game can be done in any order. Even though that means a screwed difficulty curve. Most of levels have same not-so-low difficulty level, heck. There are also varied enemies and hazard, but otherwise challenges are standard, with platforming skills required. There could be more music, as its not fun to hear same 20-seconds of slightly stressful piece of music on most of levels. P.s. Secret level is pure hardcoreness!Commander Keen 5 follows steps of CK2, offering you a ride in space station of galagtical destruction. This time around, absolutely all levels aside from secret one must be beaten! So much for traditional optimal levels. But it still has a nice levels, with varied robot enemies... these purple mantaince robots that quickly hurry around, checking computers, sure give a life to  this world. Once again you are out to destroy all the generators. Speaking of which, final one required unusual tactic, which wasn't so obvious to me. This time soundtrack feel most complete, providing a music for any needed occasion.Overall, Commander Keen games may not age well, but they are still able to provide some fun platforming... And are one of oldest games available on Steam, ha!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back in the day this was one of the best games out there and I would recommend it for nostalgia alone.The graphics are obviously dated but unlike most old 3D games this is still playable in my opinion. The gameplay mostly consists of jumping and shooting but there are a lot of different levels and enemies so it won't bore you quickly.When I played Commander Keen as a kid I didn't think the game was that hard but I'll have to admit these days I think it's difficult. I'd recommend it to anyone who was alive in 1990 for nostalgia's sake, the younger generation(s) probably won't enjoy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												it's commander keen, breh!! oh wow, honestly I kind of expected it to have aged worse. It's still fresh and fly. There are some caveats - this isn't really a port as much as the original games wrapped in dosbox with perhaps some minor compatibility tweaks. Things I would have hoped for - the ability to have it be sharp pixels at max resolution/fullscreen instead of blurred, support for controller being saved instead of having to be set on each load and hey would be awesome to have achievements or something thrown in there. But let's be real, it's great that it works super easily with the xbox controller at all. I used to have to play this with the keyboard and maybe it's a combo of that and age, but it turns out I'm moderately better at platformers these days.It's fun to see the evolution of the games from the first to the last one packaged here. While even in the first it's surprising how much they had in there already by the last one it's got stuff like pulling himself up over an edge, climbing poles, etc - feels just as together as any modern platformer. Check out that progression of sound design!There are some things you'll need to figure out, especially in the first - if you just jump in you won't notice the help (press f1) probably won't know how to save (press f5), might not realize collecting things nets you extra lives (press space to check your score) and so on. But you'll dig it once you figure it out.It's a shame it doesn't include Keen Dreams and Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter, but I hope that in the future we'll get stuff like Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure. That would be great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the first games I played. Well, to be accurate, Commander Keen 4 is one of the first games I played.When I first got it through Steam, I was worried that it might not have stood up to the test of time. Some games do, some games don't. I was ecstatic to find out that it had. The animation, humour, simple yet enjoyable graphics and sometimes frustrating gameplay were just as good as I remembered. This series brought us the Dopefish, which by itself gives it a big thumbs up from me. But more than that it gave me something that was, as the saying goes, easy to pick up, but difficult to master. My only question is this; shouldn't there be some new 2D Keen games for us to be enjoying?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Loved this game as a kid, in fact I loved the whole trilogy. This is a great port that I have so far enjoyed great stability. The original 3 Commander Keen games are very simple side scrolling platforms by today's standards, but remain a great source of fun. Though it may not be the best way to spend a day as it was for me back in the day. But considering the price it's a great source of nostalgia, or if you have never played these then it's a good opportunity to live some gaming history.I've never been a huge fan of the latter games, they are okay for a little bit of fun, but I've always found that the general feel of the game and controls were lacking.Disappointing that this pack does NOT include all the Keen games.

												First off, if I am correct the episodes 1-4 are now freeware. Episode 5, however, is not, plus you save the work of installing dosbox yourself (not a big deal, unless you run into trouble with it's textual interface). And a gimmick that practically doubles the value of this buy is a free fan-made mod ""Keen 9"" (google to find) which requires Keen 5 to play. Take note that the ""complete pack"" title is misleading because Keen 6 is missing. It is not legally available anywhere anymore, making it so-called ""abandonware"".My ingame time in this game is, according to steam, low, but that does not tell the whole truth. I have played this game a lot more outside steam.Commander Keens are 2d platform games from the time 25 years ago. Keen 1 - Keen 3 are on roughly the same game engine, and keen 4 - 6 run on roughly the same redone game engine, which has a much more modern feeling in it. Keen 7 is a fan-made mod of keen 4, keen 8 of keen 6 and keen 9 of keen 5.The first three keens may be just a bit too simple for many a modern gamer to enjoy. But if that bothers you not, play away! from Keen 4 onwards, however, it is an another story: with AdLib Soundblaster configuration, the sounds and music are almost modern, and so are the graphics apart from large pixels.The true source of enjoyment, however, is the level design. And without a line of script, which means that you always have a change to suspect a trap before walking into it. Each level has an uniform theme, and they are fairly well planned with quite consistent overall difficulty scaling, and a lot of originality in their challeges. They also are full of bonus places, often well hidden. There even is a secret bonus level in all but one of the games, including the fan-mades! Also the monster design shows excellent imagination and sense of humour.The game has a hardcore treatment of player errors: take a single hit, and the whole level has to be done again, and the whole game if you run out of lives. Only Keen 1, Keen 5 on easy difficulty and Keen 6 on easy or normal difficulty are fit for an average player this way. Instead, I recommend you abuse savegames if you want to play the games trough. Some Keen 3 levels are too hard anyway because you cannot save mid-level in the first three games (but there is a cheat).The game has a scoring mechanism like minigames, but if you want to use it you have to define a bit of extra rules for that: There are levels wih more than one extra life, and collectibles are restored after restarting the level.Overall, I recommend if you are more interested in exploring difficult, handcraft-quality levels than the mainline story.

												You, Commander Keen, fight for the safety of your beloved planet. For its time, the graphics are ok to say the least. In terms of sound, you generally get your typical robotic pew-pew sounds. As a platformer, you trek across the stage avoiding aliens and accumulating points to reach the exit. This is your generic beat the bad guys, get the keys, open the doors, and head for the exit platformer.For 1990s nostalgia purposes only, this is a great game for a couple of hours of gameplay to complete all games in the collection and re-live some childhood games. If you've never stumbled upon this game in the past, I would say ignore this game as it's nothing out of the ordinary.7/10 decent game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you hate fun in all of its forms?  Then this game wouldn't be for you, also, I deeply pity you.  If you enjoy platforming, space, and a child with the inexplicable ablity to surive on alien plants (DO THEY HAVE AIR, YOU DON'T KNOW) then Commander Keen is for you.  You might consider me biased because Commander Keen was one of the very first games I remember playing.  You would be right.Sign over your soul and also your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												its comander keen. a classic DOS platformer. challenging at times cuz, well, we are nerfed these days so  we dont get discouraged from playing. I found using joy to key and a controller makes this feel and act more like games of yore( being games of YORE on the console world). its pretty good. not too indepth but you couldnt get that indepth back then. still pretty good. I'd actually like to see iD take this IP out of the closet dust it off and make a psychonauts/ rachet and clank style cartoony kids 3D platformer. 6.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I personally never played this when I was younger, but my brothers sure as hell did! One day, one of them sent me this, saying that I should play it since it was such an important part of gaming history. I did and... Eh.Although it's confusing at first, the controls are rather simple and very smooth. It's just... Not what you'd expect nowadays. For earlier DOS standards, the graphics are pretty good. May as well get if if you never played it.Watch out now, here comes a load of text for each of the games in the collection, this is gonna be a doozey!Episode 1: Marooned On MarsBilly Blaze, eight year-old genius, working diligently in his backyard clubhouse has created an interstellar starship from old soup cans, rubber cement and plastic tubing. While his folks are out on the town and the babysitter has fallen asleep, Billy travels into his backyard workshop, dons his brother's football helmet, and transforms into... Commander Keen - Defender of Earth!In this episode, aliens from the planet Vorticon VI find out about the eight year-old genius and plan his destruction. While Keen is out exploring the mountains of Mars, the Vorticons steal vital parts of his ship and take them to distant Martian cities! Can Keen recover all the pieces of his ship and repel the Vorticon invasion? Will he make it back before his parents get home? Stay tuned!Keen's mission in this game is to find back the stolen parts of his ship. The evil Vorticons have stolen four objects from the ship and hidden them all in different places on Mars. Commander Keen's Megarocket was constructed from objects found around his house, which have been modified into starship parts. As a manual flight controller, he has used a joystick from his brother's video game. As for electricity, he has used a car battery from his mom's car. A heavily modified vacuum cleaner from their kitchen has been used as a ion propulsion unit. And as for fuel, he has used everclear from his dad's liquor cabinet.Episode 2: The Earth ExplodesIn this episode a Vorticon Mothership is poised above Earth, preparing to destroy every major city within their deadly Tentalus Ray! Keen must sneak aboard the ship and stop each Tantalus team from their terrible task. If he fails, the Earth explodes!As you already know, your mission is to stop these evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s from blowing up the earth. In order to do this you need to find and destroy each X-14 Tantalus Ray, powered by cells from the big purple Space Amoeba. You need to find your way in the ship to each Tantaulus Control Room. You start in the ship's galley, and and must find items to help you on your quest. You already have a Vorticon Hyper-Pistol, which has almost no ammunition at all, and of course, the pogo stick from your mars adventure.Episode 3: Keen Must DieIn the last episode commander keen disabled the Vorticon Mothership, and now in this final episode in the trilogy commander keen is making his way to the planet Vorticon VI. Then he lands on the island of Vortville, from where he tries to travel to the city of New Vorticon, which is very well guarded by a huge vorticon army. Then he must pass the impossible maze of the Caves of Oblivion. When he passes it, he will finally reach the Castle of the Grand Intellect. Just who is The Grand Intellect and can you stop him before he destroys earth?Now your mission is to make your way to the Castle of the Grand Intellect on the planet Vortiocon VI, and discover the secret of the Grand Intellect. The Vorticon Elder on the Vorticon's Mothership told you two things. Firstly, the Vorticons are not evil - the Grand Intellect is controlling them with his ""Mind-Belts"". And secondly, the Grand Intellect is from Earth! Who could he be?Episode 4: Secret Of The OracleBilly has been working on a new invention in this episode. His latest invention is the Photachyon Tranceiver, a radio that can reviece signals from anywhere in the galaxy. After playing around with his new invention, he suddenly hears a strange message: ""brrzzz ... giggg ... oment of great triumph ... frzzt ... ast the Milky Way will be ... huzzzzz ... terly destroyed ... pyuneeeeeeg ... can stop us now. We will remake the galaxy in the name of the Gannalech. Power to our race! power to the Shikadi!"" After zapping his parents, Billy heads to The Oracle of Gnosticus IV, who will help Billy with his mission.But after arriving on Gnosticus IV he discovers that the Shikadi have already been there. The Shikadi seems to have kidnapped all the members of the council, and taken them all to the shadow lands in the west side of the planet. Sounds like a interesting mission for commander keen.Episode 5: The Armageddon MachineThe story in this episode continues from the ""Secret of the Oracle"" episode. In last episode, Keen rescued all the members of the council. And now in episode 5, Keen finds out about the Shikadi's enourmous ship, which has the largest weapon ever built. Now it seems like the Shikadi have built a huge machine to destroy the world. And now Commander Keen flies to the Shikadi's ship in order to save the world.Your mission in this episode is to find the various power stations and break them with your pogo stick, and then to destroy the main power cell and make the armageddon machine harmless.Surprisingly, episode 6: Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter isn't in this collection. I dunno why but they must have their reasons.(I told ya that was gonna be a doozey, didn't I?)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are a die-hard Commander Keen fan, then this pack is for you. If you are a casual fan who wants some feelings of nostalgia, save your money. While I do appreciate Steam making it easy to launch and play the game (Dosbox is setup internally), this complete pack does not include all of the games. You also still get the advertising in game and the first few Commander Keen games are so basic and minimal that it only brought me feelings of frustration, not nostalgia.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Commander Keen is a great game, a great series. Were it only that simple, I would recommend this in a heartbeat. But I cannot.This is a horrible purchase.Why?For starters, maybe it's a problem with every last time I've downloaded the game, but there is no music. At all. And that's assuming that you can get it to work. This runs horribly with DOSBox, this runs horribly with Commander Genius. I'm inclined to believe that there is something intriniscally wrong with the files they are distributing in this pack.Don't let this botched release sour you on other classic games using DOSBox; this is the only one that seems to be messed up.
