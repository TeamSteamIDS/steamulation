												When you see the 44 metascore you might think this game is broken, but if you actually read the reviews you'll find out that the reviewers always complain about the same 3 issues:1st, they were too dumb to notice that this game is NOT a simulator, it's a mayhem arcade (a kind of 3D Rock 'n' Roll Racing). So, complains about the ""unrealistic physics"" are just stupidity. It's like complaining that Mario Kart is not realistic!2nd, the game is too short. Now, it is true that there are too few tracks and too few cars, but the game actually runs very well with no bugs at all and it is actually fun for some fast destruction racing with friends.And 3rd, the graphics are not top quality. But in my opinion, they are good enough. (Actually, I just can't understand why people give so much importance to graphics on games. Fabulous graphics may impress you at first, but after some minutes you get used to it and your entertainment will actually rely much more on other aspects, not on the graphics, unless it's so bad that it hampers gameplay, which is rare and definitely not the case here)Though there are better titles out there, it's 44 metascore is simply absurd. This is not the first time I see a totally misleading metascore. I can't trust it anymore after this one.			",424,155,20,83,44,4,112

												Have you ever watched the movie The Road Warrior?  Have you ever watched the climatic, carnage-filled final chase scene and thought, ""Man, I wish I could do that!""?  Have you ever secretly fapped to that scene?  If you answered yes to either or both of those last two questions, you might want to check out this game before seeking professional help.Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is not a great racing game.  Nor is it a great smah 'em up.  But it is a decent hybrid of those two genres that provides some easy to get into and humorous fun (any game that has a metal version of 'Jingle Bells' in the set list gets a smile from me).  There's a handful of cars, a handful of tracks and a couple of different play modes that provides some variety.  That said, I don't think there's enough to justify the normal full price of the game.  Pick it up on sale.			",76,42,1,55,28,2,28

												I got this game by exchanging with others and didn't really expect the quality while seeing the metascore, but after I actually play it I found it's enjoyable spending time with friends. Graphics and music are nice while it's also easy to learn and control. It could be better if there are more maps and customized options of car designs.Not that bad to me. :)Post Apocalyptic Mayhem[6/10]			",680,252,18,60,58,9,115

												Post Apocalyptic Mayhem has more strategy than your average vehicle combat racing game and that's where it shines. The goal here is to get the most kills while on a closed circuit track rather than winning a race. A simple make it to the finish line would be too easy. Since you want the most kills, if you're in first place you had best slow down and let the others catch up to you so you can wreck them. However, then you risk them overtaking you and the person in front always has the advantage when only one weapon is designed for a forward attack.Each of the game's twelve vehicles has their own set of three weapons. The front attack is usually something that shoots forward, the side attack sprays out mines of some sort and the back attack drops something. These weapons all do something slightly different. The childhood dreams school bus has a cow catcher that will throw a vehicle, the alchemist RV has an ooze gun. The logger has side saw blades, while another vehicle has mines that will throw you into reverse. The side and back attacks are temporary and disappear after a moment. When you use them a rear view camera appears so you can see if anyone hits them for your own fiendish glee. When you kill someone a notice pops up on the screen.You can have all three of your weapons ready by driving through colored barrels. Blue is the side weapon, yellow is the front, red is the rear. Black barrels give you a random charge. Having three weapons at once makes you dangerous. In fact everyone here is dangerous. You need to watch your opponents for a red, blue or yellow glow on on each respective area. Well if there's a glow on their front you'll never see it coming. There is full camera control, but the problem is you need to rotate the camera to face behind you rather than a quick look behind you. Another shame is no indicator to warn you that someone is on your six.To get into the lead position you have a nitro boost and a lot of it. If you run out, you can find more in green barrels, but otherwise it refills after a brief moment. This boost is more than a slow thrust, so there's no logic to using it. When you get a small amount of it, use it.Your vehicle has health, so getting hit with a falling log or running over ice spikes still gives you a chance of surviving. If you die, wreck or even respawn, you lose all of your charged weapons and keep what's left of your used nitro. So Post Apocalyptic Mayhem has good strategy rather than quick and crazy car combat.The courses are designed to make use of this combat with several sections that break up a map into narrow stalls, larger areas and bottlenecks. Kills are almost guaranteed without quick thinking to play defensive and let others through a narrow corridor or nitro ahead and leave barrels or fire for the others to run through. There are several different paths with each track so you always have a chance of finding a safe path to get ahead.There's an arcade mode that lets you play one track at a time, but I much prefer the apocalyptic challenge which has you playing all eight tracks back to back with a score after each one and a final score at the conclusion. This mode makes it feel like a deeper game even if its limited. The game does offer multiplayer online with ranked matches, but four years after a budget title's release means the game is inevitably dead for multiplayer. I would have enjoyed it, because medium felt easy and the hard difficulty while it was still fun, it was difficult to exceed second to last place.The vehicles all have character and there's a wide variety each with their own stats for acceleration handling and mayhem.  You have nine unlocked from the start and can select between a pair of dune buggies, a little car with a unicorn head that has a giant twisting drill, another small nuclear themed car and a few others. You'll need to purchase DLC with the ice cream truck, 1950s squad car and classic tow truck. On sale, I'd go for it. I'd advise against smaller vehicles, because a smaller body size means its tougher to hit the barrels to get weapon charges.If you think there's a balance to smaller vehicles having less body to hit with weapons, you'd be wrong, because the weapons really scatter out making them tough to avoid without stopping. The mines themselves are tiny and blinking, so they're tough to even see.The game plays like a lot of other racers with a chase cam and I feel like the game was really designed with a 360 controller in mind. Everything is color coated to the controller, even the barrels. Its true arcade style racing with throttle controls of forward and reverse. There is a hard brake, even if I never had to brake. Slowing down to let opponents catch up just meant I had to let off the forward.Now that I've discussed the good, let's turn to the bad. The weight of each vehicle is so light it felt like driving a balloon with tires. Its difficult to stay grounded even in a logging rig, a school bus or an RV. There are a lot of jumps and ramps, but I'm talking about in general you can be driving on the walls. Coming down from a high jump can bounce you back up. Its ridiculous and it took me thirty minutes before I stopped laughing at the game and had some fun with it. You can also boost through the air, because your boost is a rocket rather than strict nitrous.As for the graphics and art direction, it just looks faded and worn. I feel like I could enjoy the game more if the colors were bolder and it was more than a dusty covered look to them. I would say a dusty brown, but one of the eight courses feels little more than a happy winter wonderland of a previous course where rather than having brown sand blowing in the breeze its a snow dusting.Another interesting thing is how much the demo or trailer plays in game if you wait too long in the menu. I enjoy when games have demos or trailers and it seems to be what's missing from games now, but it plays a little too often.There's a lot working against the game despite all its positives. Its still far from a good game, but it was entertaining once I stopped laughing at it and found the strategy involved. In a sequel I would love more levels, more modes and a different, more vibrant art direction. I think a lot of people will hate it for how simplistic the weapons are with side, front and back coupled with the fact each vehicle's weapons are different and there are better vehicles.If you find it on sale, take a risk.

												Post Apocalypic Mayhem (PAM for short) was a little surprise for me. I am normally not a fan of any kind of racing/ driving genre of game, and although PAM offers something a little different when compared to GT or NFS games,  I still really enjoyed the driving aspect. Granted you won't really be playing PAM for the driving though, it's about blowing up your oponents with the various amounts of weapons and power-ups you pick up on the track as you race. The graphics are really nice, and the multiplayer is even better!Another one that I can 100% recommend!			",1544,456,43,234,159,12,209

												In Sum: Mindless fun, more of a deathmatch than a racing game.  4/5.-----This is one of the games I play when I feel like having mindless fun.  Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is a racing game, except honestly the racing doesn't matter. What really counts is the level of destruction you cause on the other drivers while racing.  The game comes with a variety of cars (ranging from an ice cream truck, police car, and more cynically, a mobile meth lab) that all play differently.  Each car gets three weapons, which are activated by finding colored barrels.  Gameplay is pretty straightforward.  Literally.  You just drive down the track, collect weapons, and make it hell for the other drivers.  If you can wreck another car, you get a point.  My big complaint about this is the DLC pack.  The additional vehicles are included in the game already as opponents, the DLC simply unlocks them as playable.  It is not particularly expensive, but it strikes me as somehow a part of the full game is removed and hidden behind a paywall.			",173,41,6,32,22,4,50

												This game is a blast and i return to play it every now and then either as Single Player or as Multiplayer despite it's age.  Multiplayer matches are rare but totally worth it when you manage to assemble a couple of drivers for a match. Game is often bundled and sold very cheaply but do not think for a moment that this is some garbage bin game.  Game has been designed with thought and this can be seen in the strategical thinking that is required to succeed rather than absolute skill in driving laps as fast as possible. In fact you will not win if you keep trying to speed away from the others. Kills count and they can be tough to get.  Not going to spill much ink here on mechanics. other reviews has explained this very well already in deep detail. Let's just say there are vehicles for everyone and yes there are some vehicles that are more deadly than others in the hands of people who know how to use them but no car is really OP once you learn how to deal with them. Get this game and play it.			",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

												I bought this game for me and my friends on sale... was it worth it?Definitely if you are playing with friends. By yourself, it's not bad - provides entertainment but typical gamers may come back to this once in a while once they've beaten it. I found myself playing it more with friends than by myself.The game play is quite simple, you have three types of attacks, forward attack, back/rear, and sides. Then there is a boost button. Does it matter what place you come in? Well that's up to you to choose what kind of game mode you want. Are the attacks fun, unique from car to car? Yes they are, and the game even provides opportunities to unlock some cars. If you are looking for a real racing game, don't look here. This is more carnage focused. This game isn't quite burnout or flatout, but still provides some arcade fun with friends. Buy on sale.

												I should have written a review for this game ages ago. I am completely in awe of this game and I am so addicted to it. I love how the races always seem different even though I may use the same car with their own unique weapons. Every race is so unpredictable and you never know what's going to happen. This is a good distraction game for me and it makes me feel incredibly happy playing it. I can kill my opponents without the risk of getting arrested! Lol. Great music tracks to each race in the apocalyptic challenge mode as well as various cars with extremely powerful weapons. Some cars are better than others but I like to play with them all to make it even and challenge myself even more. You can play on easy which is not as easy as you would imagine but a good place to start if you are playing it for the first time. I like playing on hard. I love the challenges of the hard mode. What can I say. Good graphics, music, gameplay and interest. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is interested in buying it. If you like fun and a challenge or 2, then this game is for you. You need to be on the ball and kill your opponents in order to get the most kills if that's what you like. There is no escape! I would say that it's sometimes difficult to play in multiplayer if you can't get any players to join but it's a good excuse to get your friends to buy it too! Thanks to the developers of PAM, you rock!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is a fun, arcade-type racing game where the goal is to destroy as many opponents as possible with a variety of weapon pick-ups. There are no laps and your position in the race does not matter, there is only a countdown timer that signifies the end of the match. Unfortunately, that simple description is where the fun ends.The game is broken. Some vehicles are obviously better than the others and the ones that are lacking in certain areas are not awarded any compensation in the remaining aspects as you would come to expect. A vehicle that is extremely slow generally does not gain a weapon that can be used over distance, rather requiring you to home in on your enemy before launching an assault from the front, side, or rear. Vehicles faster than you can manage to ""hoard"" all of the pick-ups, leaving you with the frustrating realisation that you are crippled and unequal.Fast vehicles have the advantage, even if they have horrible steering. Certain faster vehicles in particular have weapons that create an area-of-effect that can wipe out every opponent in a single attack. Unless you like the challenge it is simply unwise to select a vehicle that is slow and cumbersome.In my short experience I've come to understand that the online matchmaking system and netcode is completely broken. There is no way to cancel a connecting session, you are simply forced to sit and stare at what might be a match being made or what might turn out to be a failed connection. Once you've successfully joined a game you might find yourself stuck in starting position, like stone, as you watch other opponents speed off only to look to the side and see another half-dozen opponents frozen in the same position as you. There is nothing you can do, the only course of action here is to force-close the game by using the task manager or through Alt+F4.I've also now discovered that if you check someone's ""gamercard"" while you're waiting for the match to start you will not be able to close the Steam overlay as it will continue opening the person's Steam profile over and over again. The only way to successfully stop this is to wait for the match to begin and close the overlay or simply force the game to close through the task manager, as the overlay prevents Alt+F4 from working most of the time. This is a massive oversight on behalf of the developer and who knows if bugs such as these will ever be fixed.			",824,300,26,81,66,10,105

												Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is one of those games where everything sounds good on paper, but the execution is lacking.I guess this is supposed to be a racing game, but the arcade & challenge modes revolve around blowing up as many rivals as possible. This is accomplished by grabbing weapons off the track. Players can equip weapons for the front, sides, and rear. There's also a boost for catching up to the...mayhem. With a multitude of tracks and a variety of cars to drive, this game gets a pass in terms of content.In practice though...ehhh...hmmm..oh uh well shoot. There's really no incentive for actually trying to race. The winner is determined solely by # of kills. At this point, why not just have a big arena? Make it a car combat game like the Twisted Metal series. Actually that wouldn't work because most of the weapons are designed for a racing game. It's a head-scratcher of the a design-decision, since it applies to the entirety of the single-player. There is a multiplayer mode for racing, but everyone is going to destroy each other anyway(or at least they would if anyone played this game online). All that said, it isn't really a big deal. I'm just annoyed as hell because while playing the game I got hit with a nasty bug. At one point the game gets stuck on a loading screen. It stinks but it happens. I bring up the task manager, but the game pops right back up with its infinite loading. I try to bring up task manager again, and the loading screen comes right back. This freakin' game was trying to hold my computer hostage! I had to restart the PC just to get out of that mess. That little experience soured me on the entire game. As soon as everything was back to normal, I uninstalled this piece of crap with the quickness. I'm not saying it could happen to you, but what if it did? What...if...it...did?I wasn't feelin' it anyway. The game isn't even compelling enough to grind out a few achievements for. The loading-screen bug was the 2x4 that broke the camel's back.

												This game is developed by these people http://steelmonkeys.com/enAnd it must be noted that this game actually disappeared for quite some time from Steam Store only to quietly reappear at a later date. The reason for this seems simply to be because the developers disassociated themselves from the Meridian 4 group for a period of time. Even during the absence of this game on the store page, the PAM community was still playing it, with their friends quite frequently.You will also notice that this game has what seems quite an absurd meta critic review score 44/100 when you compare it to the large amount of positive reviews from the gamers themselves. One of the biggest complaints to the game is that it has relatively few levels 7 all up and a handful of cars 12 only which some are quite decent.The game is best described as a Mad Max version of Mario Kart. The objective is to not only be the fastest around the track, but also the one who has the most kills. Hence it is possible to win the game even coming in third place or something as long as those in first and second place do not have more kills than you.To help you get the kills each car is fitted with a wide arrange of novelty weapons which only activate by running over the corresponding colored barrels on the race track. Each car has a weapon that shoots from the side of the car, shoots behind the car and shoots in front of the car, there is also a turbo boost you can pick up. Each directional weapon is color coded to a corresponding barrel color. While this may sound complicated you will pick up the idea within the first lap.The cars handle really well and the map courses are quite eye pleasing and somewhat versatile when it comes to terrain. When the game suggests mayhem it aint kidding. On the harder difficulties you will spend most of your time bouncing around the screen by all the explosions thanks to your enemies. The game caters single player, multiplayer and campaign. It must also be noted that there is a large amount of achievements that are dedicated to the multiplayer aspects of this game, the frustrating thing is that there are few that play the multiplayer online, unless they are playing with friends. So if your an achievement hunter you may wish to seriously think about buying the multiple pack of this game so that you can play it with your friends. This game is definitely fun and really quite decent, having said that I would still recommend that you wait for it to go on a sale. Since the game was developed back in 2011, hopefully steel mokeys will one day stop scrathing and sniffing their behinds and give us more levels and dlc to please the players. There is serious potential here, but alas still only peanuts of material given.			",1239,552,53,82,123,5,127

												I think PAM gives a simple short & fast paced punch of fun, and though it's not particularly special, if all you're looking for is a simple car combat racer then you'll come back to play this time and time again and it wont leave you disappointed.HighlightsSimplicity is rarely a benefit, but this game pulls it off well. It's succinct and straight to the point. Everything fits and makes sense and the controls serve it well. This is a problem as well as a benefit because it may lead to boredom from lack of variety for some, but the fact that the developers have a complete package with few flaws and tight gameplay holds value.Mistakes & AnnoyancesThe most severe problems with PAM are the same universal problems that the vast majority of multiplayer racing games suffer from: the lack of persistent mutliplayer. After a certain amount of time all multiplayer games will suffer from this, and that's just part of the scene, but for a game who's best enjoyment comes from the multiplayer combat and blasting and racing with and against your friends, it's sad that it's pretty much dead just a few years after release and the absence of local mutliplay is definitely a black mark.Steam groups like PAM Multi may help to alleviate this and find people to play with, and the single player is still strong enough alone to have plenty of fun, but it's a big loss and may be a deal breaker for you, especially when compared against newer releases with similar mechanics and more players. If you have friends with the title or you're happy to blast around racing against the AI in single player then this probably isn't an issue for you.Lack of content, specifically tracks and game modes is also an issue. With just an arcade racing mode, a slightly extended Challenge mode and only 7 tracks you can expect to explore all this game has to offer in a couple of hours. Yes, the game is simple chaotic fun, and the limited variety of vehicles and power-ups mean that every play will be slightly different, but it's still very much a one trick pony. The question is whether that pony is fun enough for you to ride on long enough to justify the price.RecommendationsOn Steam at $9.99/£6.99/9,99€, Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is good value for money for a game you're likely to come back to time and time again. There's also a 3-Pack option on Steam, which offers a negligible discount, and two Next Dimension packs which offer their other less positively reviewed game I, Gladiator which should probably be avoided. There's also the Chaos Pack DLC which offers 3 additional vehicles. This isn't much, but the price is so low that it's a fair buy for those who have played through the game and still enjoy it enough to pick up some extra vehicles.* There's a well put together PDF Manual with some information on the vehicles, controls and more available here[cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com].

												A decent racing-themed car brawler where the aim (in the main game modes) is to blow up opposing racers as many times as possible within a time limit by picking up bonuses from the track which enable you to use one of your three combat abilities, which for multiplayer purposes seem pretty unbalanced between the cars, but for single player interest there is a fair range of different preferences catered for - you have cars (trucks, ice cream vans) whose best weapons are laid like mines ahead of the enemy racers, others that need to be adjacent to the target for best (or only) results, and others that attack from behind, with a couple with a mix of options.The racing, particularly single player isn't too great, the controls aren't the smoothest and most of the time where you placed in the race is irrelevant compared to how much mayhem you inflicted - racing far ahead is usually easy, even on the tougher difficulties of most tracks, but means you will have no one around to attack, thus guaranteeing a loss, so the main advantage is first choice of which bonus to pick up before moving to the appropriate position to use it.The tracks have a reasonable variety, which a strong preference for lots of jumps and other risky locations to crash and burn, either unaided or with some help from your friendly competition, but the directions are well signposted so the learning curve of new tracks isn't too steep in most cases. The graphics are servicable enough but not amazing, and audio does the job well enough.So overall it is a bit of fun, but be aware the multiplayer side of things is sparse (if that) unless you bring your own, and even if you do don't expect a fair fight, but nevertheless it is a reasonable game.

Pink flamingos as a weapon? 10/10Craziest weapon selection in a computer game ever! This game is not about racing. It's about war!This one was once a small little gem, that was sadly overlooked and suffered from race quitters in it's multiplayer times. The game looks nice with a cool aesthetic and a good driving feeling. On release there were only three maps available which were fun to play. Thank to the devs a free DLC was released adding new content like two new maps and three new cars. The cars are well balanced starting from small fast ones to big slower ones. All cars have a front, side and a back attack. Every car has its unique crazy weapons which are activated by collecting power-up barrels on the race track. All weapons are fun and you should definitely try out all the cars with their weapons to better choose what car is best for you.If this game is on a sale grab it! You won't regret it. Even if mulitplayer is dead now you will enjoy the single player long enough.			",767,137,28,29,28,3,67

												This game is surprisingly fun for its metascore. It has a Rock N Roll racing, arcade style feel because you have to pick up weapons from the track and the focus is on competing for those powerups and killing your opponents. However, its not a racing game. First place is measured by kills, so pulling ahead of your opponents where its difficult to damage them, actually results in a loss. The game needs some balance between racing and being a meat grinder, otherwise theres no reason to follow a course at all, just make it thunderdome.			",44,5,1,10,6,0,9

												Trying to mix things up is a commendable effort, but P.A.M. just comes off as a lazy attempt to revive a previously saturated genre. If there were more tracks and game modes, there could've been a much better game to speak of here.A bit entertaining, but flawed; just like its mythological counterparts. Brings up nostalgia for old school car fighting games, but it has a ton of issues and the online community is basically nonexistant. It also comes off like a very poor console port.Horrible controls, poor physics, random invisible walls which result in car jumps/spins in the air, almost all weapons are instant kill with no aim required.The empty and amateurish Post Apocalyptic Mayhem belongs in the junkyard, not on your PC. Overall 3/10.			",2260,866,87,236,310,22,349

												A fun little hidden gem I recently came across. The controls need a bit of tweaking to get your perfect setup, but once you've done that you're ready to roll. Race and destroy your opponents before they destroy you. Its Road Warrior meets Death Race and I'm loving it. The downside is: there are only a limited selection of maps and vehicles so it can get quite lonely and sort of boring in singleplayer. But it's still a cool game.			",258,66,4,11,40,2,19

												One thing that strikes me more than any other aspect of this game is the creativity. Everything in this game is very unique and stands out from other racing games; from the vehicles to the tracks, and of course the weapons. It is so much fun. This is by no means a realistic racing game and the laws of phyisics are thrown out the window, so if that's what you are looking for, look elsewhere. What this game is is a ton of fun. It's probably my favorite arcade style racing game I've played. All the tracks are unique, (from a Christmas themed track, to a cold war beach and an airplane graveyard) and the vehicals are just fantastic and all handle differently. My personal favorite is ""Kitty With Claws."" It may not be the fastest or the biggest, but I think it stears the best. You have three different weapons at your disposal to create chaos on the track and take out other vehicals. Each weapon is replenished by picking up power ups laying on the track in the form of different color barrels. Each vehicle has their own brand of weapons and are very satisfying to use when executed correctly. The only problem is that there is hardly anyone playing online anymore. But I have had a fantastic time against the AI in all the tracks. Since I have always been terrible at racing games, (realistic or arcade style) I find playing on easy mode gives me a good enough challenge and still maintains its fun factor. Give this game a try if you are into racing games but want something different.			",731,96,46,89,28,0,26

However, its not all fun and explosions, as there isn't a lot of ""game"" to play and trying to find a random multiplayer game is like trying to find a strawberry field in the middle of an apocalyptic desert.  With that said, this is a great game to pick-up if you can find it on a good sale...but may not be worth the full price tag.			",338,136,9,78,9,1,64

												This game is fun for a very short amount of time, it doesnt offer many vehicles or maps, this game is not a typical racer, its basically twisted metal but you drive around in a circle rather then through buildings and towns. Not sure why they even bother to have a position ranking since coming first or last doesnt effect anything all you need is this most kills, this game should be played in an arena not a circle, and why is there no health pickups? Seems silly since you can damage yourself with your own powers. Game has no storyline, the multiplayer is completely dead which sucks since 50% of achievements require you to play ranked multiplayer and the match making requires another person to go into your lobby and ready up before a match can even begin. The lack of vehicles with unique powers makes this game repetitive and boring. The cars dont even move that fast so it feels slow. Im sure this game was great in 2011 but at the moment with its single player being the only mode you can really play its just a snorefest so i cant recommend it.			",237,28,9,26,22,1,26

												Personally, I really like PAM- yes there isn't much content, but what there is, is a fun little racing game with some combat. Yes, there aren't many cars or tracks, but you can still have a lot of fun with what is actually here. I'd say that the game is worth it, if it's on sale, but you should probably hold off until then- it fairly regularly goes 90% off- that makes it less than £1- you could get a little racing game for less than the cost of a bottle of pretty much any drink anywhere- it's your choice, but I'd recommend this with its DLC- less than £1 and I'm sure you could get at least an hour or two of fun out of it- I did.

												A sorely underrated combat racing game, P.A.M. will have you grinning from ear to ear (maniacal laughter optional) each and every time you convert one of your opponents into scrap, and with a current total of 12 different vehicles (three of which from a cheap DLC) and each posessing three different unique attacks, you won't soon run out of ways to wreak havoc.P.A.M. sets itself apart from other combat racers in that almost all of the attacks are close range or drops, and only kill count matters, but don't think that means any newbie can come out on top; Avoiding your opponents' attacks requires SKILL, and pulling off your own lethal maneuvers requires a devious mind.For casual destruction or heated competition, consider giving this little gem a chance.

Unfortunately, it fails because it doesn't have anywhere near as much content, and is mind-bogglingly unimaginative in almost every respect, especially in the design of its vehicles and the levels themselves (which is doubly frustrating because there are so few of them). Evidently quality over quantity doesn't apply here.And maybe I wouldn't be so put off by this title if not for the price; the notion of paying $10 for this is more absurd than exploding flamingos. I picked this up for $3 in a sale, and I still feel ripped off. I'm stunned by how many positive reviews there are.			",27,3,0,2,0,0,0

												First Impression:This game was the single-most frustrating racing-shooter game I have ever played. I can give you the nutshell:The Ugly:INVISIBLE WALLS. And if they aren't invisible, the existing walls sure as heck have longer edges than what appears. TRAMPOLINE physics. No such thing? Might as well be. You launch yourself in the air with seemlessly ""almost"" zero gravity that you will more than likely fall of the track, lose all your pickups (which are not random and almost useless sometimes) OR bounce off the invisible walls, only to be facing the reverse direction which takes longer to spin yourself around and continue forward than it does to just push the ""reset"" button to have the game reset your position on the track (which is hella far away). POOR CONTROLSI'd rather play outside in the snow naked right now. Sure it sounds fun in theory, but then come inside the house after all itchy and frostibitten. Then try pooping with a chapped butt. P.s. it seemed like every time i landed from ""air time"" that the car would immediately turn a hard left or hard right upon landing. So don't take large jumps, there's no reward for it other than the feeling of flight (but it's a racing game). The Sadness:I was a fan of Re-volt, Toy Commander, Mario Karts (most of them), Rock n Roll racing, Death Race, Road Kill Rally (you bet!), Micro Machines racing (amazing!) and EVEN the long forgotten 360 game that was made by SEGA ""Full Auto"" (which failed to present a sequel on the 360 but continued on PS3). This game would have been way better off choosing to either have a balanced mechanic for fighting WHILE racing OR just a Twisted Metal/Interstate clone. There is no point to the racing. It had potential at some point. I feel like the developers gave up or something. Maybe one of them quit? It happens. People are scumbags in the coding world (they all have egos).The Good: Being that this game was free, I still don't care for it. I just got it for the steam cards (sorry devs, but it's true). I just... I don't know. The menu looked okay, but WHY IN GOD'S NAME DID IT START ME IN THE LOWEST RESOLUTION POSSIBLE (240p)?What else... I don't know. The sound was used from stock sounds and borrowed from other games. I don't know if you can copyright every game sound in existence.. but that's not a good thing either. OH here is another good thing, when and I mean WHEN you fall way far behind the goon cars, you have a crazy amount of turbo to help you catch up (it relieved some stress), but the poor controls only ended up making it my worse enemy.

												I really enjoy this game.  Its pretty basic, drive around shoot other people and try to come in first.But over all its really short, there is not many maps for it, it can get boring pretty quickly.  If you can pick it up for under a buck, I say go for it, I paid a bit more for it.  I still start it up now and then and go for around or 2, but other than that it doesn't see much action.If a new map pack were released for say 5 bucks and it came with 15 to 20 maps I'd snap it up in a second without even waiting for it to go on sale, thats how much I like this game.  But I doubt thats ever gonna happen.			",966,125,85,75,112,14,155

												Coming hot off the heels of finally giving Burnout Paradise a go, I was eager for some more silly arcade racing goodness. Post Apocalyptic Mayhem has been collecting dust for quite a while and it looked (from the screenshots) that it would fit the bill perfectly.I really adore the over-the-top and entirely impractical vehicles of destruction; my personal favorite was immediately the school bus. I jumped immediately into the first course and, within 30 seconds, was really disappointed. The game performs lovely, and visually it may not be able to compete with the likes of Mad Max but it’s nothing to complain about. Had this been any other genre, I would say the handling was abysmal; however, the floaty and silly vehicle physics fit right in with the style. Here’s the problem: it is SO SLOW. And I don’t mean that driving a 4 ton school bus outfitted with steel plate armor was a bit sluggish. On the contrary, I flew past everyone else on the track with very little effort. The problem is that there is literally no sense of speed. If I had to guess the approximate top speed I reached, I would say roughly 50-60 MPH with the rocket boost held down. There was zero thrill to navigating the course. What disheartens me more is that the problem couldn’t be solved with a simple edit of the vehicle data files because the levels are clearly not designed for any faster speed.I loved the weapons and the vehicular combat. When I slowed down enough to engage the other drivers I had a blast flipping them over my head and peppering them with napalm cluster mines, but everything was just so slow and unenthusiastic. The excitement of any exchange of blows was immediately sapped away by the dull driving experience. I do not believe PAM is a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s not a game I would suggest a friend to pick up. I would be really excited to see a more aggressive and faster sequel because I think they have a decent foundation to work with here.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												This is one of the games I play when I feel like having mindless fun. Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is a racing game, except honestly the racing doesn't matter. What really counts is the level of destruction you cause on the other drivers while racing. The game comes with a variety of cars (ranging from an ice cream truck, police car, and more cynically, a mobile meth lab) that all play differently. Each car gets three weapons, which are activated by finding colored barrels. Gameplay is pretty straightforward. Literally. You just drive down the track, collect weapons, and make it hell for the other drivers. If you can wreck another car, you get a point.  ",424,68,5,71,85,2,150

												I'd like to start off by saying I grew up playing the Twisted Metal series & Post Apocalyptic Mayhem (PAM) game is pretty simular to that game except with a racing aspect to it! I got PAM for free as a limited-time promo from Green Man Gaming & noticed it had a low metascore which made me almost not get it, but reading some of the reviews changed my mind about this game! It's  unique because of the method of shooting - you have a frontal, side, and rear attack indicated by color (yellow = front, blue = side, red = back, & green = boost)The only 2 problems I've had with this game are that the in-game Steam user interface (Shift + Tab) is laggy for some reason & sometimes while playing mulitplayer, you can't move at the beginning of the race (this only happened to me twice in my hour of gameplay) but to fix it, simply press escape and resume. Other than these 2 flaws, the gameplay is amazing! :DI rate this game 7/10 - you can drive a unicorn car named Kitty With Claws!			",632,128,17,48,42,9,56

												Looks are bland. Controls are weird. You have to manage to handle 7 buttons to shoot and look into different directions. But you can't drive normally if you are looking back. So you constantly trying to guess whether someone is close enough behind you to be hit by your back or side weapons and this is annoying. Physics are also goofy. Gameplay is very repetitive and becomes boring very fast. And you can't just quickly restart the race. You have to hop through several menu selections again to do this..

I found myself just bouncing constantly from walls and small obstacles and spinning out of control constantly. Even the CPU could barely handle the physics in the game. Every small car I've tried out in this game seems to be the most subjugated to its out-of-control physics whatwith them bouncing the hardest and flying the highest and just whatever else.

												I'm going to have to thumb this one down. PAM has some nice vehicle models and potentially fun arcade racing, but it never feels right. The handling remains awfully slow and floaty, no matter which vehicle you drive. If you want to try it, wait until it's for sale. At the lowest price possible. Or just spend your money on racing games with better engines, like Nail'd or Burn Out Paradise.			",416,219,12,72,43,3,73

												This would be one of the better Early Access games on Steam, if it were Early Access.  However, the devs somehow seem to think this game is ""complete"".  It's not.  The mechanics are there, but there's no real game yet.  No goal.  The cars really aren't balanced that well, the game mechanics could use a bit of fine tuning (it's really easy to just chain red barrels with a car that has a great rear attack).  This game is a good start, but it's not polished enough for me to recommend it.			",646,192,15,85,65,6,121

												It is not bad game, I like action and speed on this game, but there are not many people playing it, so you usually stuck in single player which can be boring. Also it is very pitty that you cant customize your own cars, only have to choose one from six or seven? cars. Graphic is ok, music can be better, but in general, I recommended this game, you will have lot of fun with it but it was close rating. Multiplayer is fun, I like it, but you can consider yourself as  lucky playing it with more than 3 person online.			",11,1,1,0,2,0,0

												It's a combat car racing game. The game is fun in short burst, but it quickly fades.Pro:Car Combat with interesting weaponsCon:Graphics are blah which is fine, but it seems really blurry at times and low res.Music is repetitiveMultiplayer is dead2 Modes. Arcade and Apocalyptic Challenge. I could never complete the challenge due to crashing/freezing when doneRandom crashes after finishing a match4 maps + holiday map with 8-10 cars. It gets old fast.It's an alright game if you have friends and can set up online matches...just by itself though, reconsider			",315,36,13,41,23,4,31

												I wish I had a neutral review for this, because I'm not overly excited about the game, nor am I terribly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at it. In fact, I quite like this game.Let's start with what I like:There's a nod-off to Breaking Bad (You get to use the RV as a driving option, and it kicks♥♥♥♥♥There's a nice variety of cars, with an equally nice variety of weapons, and feelings to them.The music is damned good.The tracks aren't extremely linear, and there's a good amount of shortcuts, and alternate routes. There are a few re-skins, but they're winter themed, so it's not exactly a money-grubbing ripoff.What I don't like:Handbrake = Car flip button. No powersliding here, cheif.Lack of modes. This got me the most, I kinda wanted something like a demolition derby bowl race. There's only two modes. Play through all the maps until you fail mode, and single race mode.I guess some kind of progression, and upgrades system would also be nice, but I'm not too fussed. Overall, though, this game is well worth the money.			",597,160,22,78,49,9,68

												I don't know what to say - it's a close resemblance to Carmageddon, but with lag. Extreme and somehow ""intentional"" lag. I can only either win a game by being faster than everyone or lose by having to fall behind. All this is because everytime I get near an opponent, the game reduces itself to a 2-3 frames pr. sec kinda game..It's impossible to play - I meet all the lousy req's this game has by far - so why am I lagging?The internets aren't broken, pc running on very healthy status and it's versus bots most the time. (Cuz' you just want to play a quick match!)So the lagg must be intentional - don't buy this game unless they change THAT part. 2/10 (Only reason it isn't 0/10 is because it's a ""Carmageddon look-a-like"")			",107,3,2,10,4,0,6

												Myself and my girlfriend really love this game. I like it as its actually playable without being over the top like many other racers. We want to go around corners at high speed on turbo and go flying though the air without skidding off into some over graphicfied building. Some say the graphics look cartoonish, they are far from poor and a lot of detail and design has gone into the cars and levels. I actually prefer ""game looking"" graphics more than ""real world"" type graphics. I drive miles each week on the M1 personally, why the heck would I want to come home and look at more of the same ?  I wan't to get away from the ""real world"" and enjoy playing game which look like game, not like the past 2 hours of stuff I have been looking at. The AI drivers could be a little better, but they can more than give you a good race. Play with friends no problem!  Blow them up with rockets or donuts or whatever you want, which gives the game a little bit more fun than just going around a fancy looking racetrack all day thinking ""wow the graphics are so cool"" which isn't playing a game IMHO. The graphics are good in PAM even considering its a old game now. We have tried other racing games and really do not get on with them at all. So if your alike and want something easy and fun to play then give PAM a try! Its next to nothing in price.  My only bad thoughts are the are not many tracks, I think 7 after the bonus pack. They are big tracks and even after playing for several hours we can still manage to get lost in them. I really wish they made more tracks or a editor for PAM, possibly more cars too. Though we will be playing it for the foreseeable future for sure! Well worth a couple of quid! ",9,0,1,0,0,0,1

												Quite a nice little game in the style of Destruction Derby Raw (PSX) mixed with a bit of Micro Machines (Amiga). I got nostalgic since the first run.Driving itself is slightly stiff and very arcadey, the cars each with a different set of ""abilities"" triggered by powerups are fun to test and the tracks have a nice design with some tricky corners.Not exactly GOTY material but fun while it's lasting if your into a game that's super-easy to get into, and them achievements add a bit of spice and challenge to the mix.

												Complete ♥♥♥♥ing turdburger. It should be called T.U.R.D. instead: Total Utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Disappointment. The main menu loaded just fine, then I pulled up the Steam overlay - and dookie rained from the mutha♥♥♥♥in sky. Typing in Steam chat, I asked a friend to join my game, and hit enter. Nothin. I typed it again, nothin.So i tried to close the overlay, and the game said ""EAT BALLS"" (Trans: nothin). SO I attempted again to contact someone to play the damn game with. SOL and JWF. Tried alt-tab, nope. Ctrl-alt-del? Nada. Just the moment I had decided I must hard boot my PC, which is a no-no to anyone who knows better, and a sin to a PCMR, everything was fixed! Then it immediately locked up again, this time with no Steam overlay, confirming that it was in fact the game, and not a Steam glitch (do those exist at this magnitude? NO? Didn't think so). Tried everything again. Ended up hard booting my PC. Uninstalled, and will not be reinstalling. Can't really complain about a $0.69 game, but then again I can because it made me hardboot. ♥♥♥♥ that noise. Don't buy this.			",201,28,3,23,13,1,18

Posted: June 26, 2014
												In short: Post Apocalyptic Mayhem (PAM) is a combat racing game where the players race ad-hoc battle machines through various sandblasted locales, with the ultimate goal being to rack up as many kills as possible within five minutes.Since this is a driving game, lets talk about the vehicles first. Generally speaking, the smaller the vehicle, the more ""zippy"" and easier-to-control it feels. Larger vehicles trade in control for weapon power and the ability to take a beating. Not exactly the most original concept, but it's reliable and makes perfect sense within the apocalyptic setting.The driving mechanics themselves do not do a good job of conveying a sense of speed. Even when using Nitrous, you're never going to feel like you're breaching 50 MPH - as a result, when you manage to catch some big air in a race, it's going to feel like your vehicle has very ""floaty"" physics. As a veteran player of Dethkarz, Re-Volt, Trackmania and Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed, this strongly irritates me. On the plus side, there is very little overlap between each vehicle's unique weapons. There are four types of weapon pickups you can collect, each color reponding to either extra fuel for your boost meter, or front-facing, side-facing, and rear-facing weapons. Though most side-weapons tend to be ""a bunch of miniature bombs"", the front and rear weapons are almost always totally unique for each vehicle. As a result of each vehicle requiring a different playstyle, there is actually a huge amount of strategy in picking which vehicle you'll use during a race. I've become rather fond of the Nucloid vehicle myself.The overall level design is very, very good. There are six unique tracks, and a seventh Christmas-themed reskin of the first track.  Each level contains wide-open spaces, chokepoints, and multiple routes. Very rarely will there be a part of the track where you can't come up with a plan on-the-fly. My one complaint track-wise is that three of the game's tracks - Wasteland, Cold War Beach, and Airplane Cemetary - all have very bland aesthetics. The latter two have some interesting architecture, but Winter Wasteland is about ten times more interesting than regular Wasteland despite being little more than a reskin. The other tracks - Urban Jungle, Death Area 8, Abandoned Sawmill, and (again) Winter Wasteland have far more interesting aesthetics and are generally more fun to race on as a result.The soundtrack is... generic. Though the genre of each background song varies, they really don't add anything to the overall feel of the game. Once again, the exception being Winter Wasteland's background music, which is actually pretty damn epic for a Carol of the Bells remix.The A.I. in this game can actually be surprisingly skilled, though there is just a touch of rubberbanding involved in their programming. Playing on hard difficulty can result in most players earning an average score of around eight kills (which is a hell of a lot). Though you'll find virtually no online games being hosted, going a few rounds with friends is when this game shines at it's brightest.If this game happens to go on sale for a decent price, I urge you to give it a shot. It's not Twisted Metal, but it is a fun romp nonetheless. 7.0 \ 10 ",224,58,20,23,23,2,40

												I still owe this game a review, so I think it's time to write one. PAM is a vehicular combat arcade, and that word combination describes it quite neatly. Your primary goal is to destroy your opponents by means of weapons installed on your post-apocalyptic car. I shall underline it again, because it's not immediately clear from media files and game description: this is NOT a race. It does not matter if you come first or last: the winner is the player who killed more enemies (and got more points, consequently).All cars and weapons are available from the very beginning, there's no profile development and no campaign mode. Some of the most dangerous cars are locked, though; you will need to buy the DLC to open access to them. You will be able to make an informed decision, because the AI always has access to all cars - there'll be the chance for you to fight against DLC cars, watch their weapons in action, and decide whether you need them or not.Any car has three weapons: front, side, and rear. They are more or less balanced, but different: each one is useful in its own certain situation, so there's no universal solution fitting for any track. When you start the fight, you don't have any weapon available; you need to activate them by picking barrels distributed throughout the track, and after you have used a certain weapon once, it is deactivated again, until the next barrel. Tracks are very peculiar, both in terms of scenery and of layout. A bit of physics is included, but it's not very realistic (so far as it's an arcade).Don't expect too much of a game where ice cream refrigerators kill others by giant ice cream balls falling from their rear door, and small pink cars with ponies on their hood flood the road with dozens of teddy bears filled with explosives. Just have fun and enjoy the mayhem and chaos you wreak along with other horrible, rusty, freaky cars that had somehow survived the unknown apocalypse.			",77,8,2,22,8,0,5

												I think that PAM is in fact quite underrated. I wasn't expecting much from it, but playing the game was a real fun!Graphics are really nice, and it runs very smooth on my PC, unlike lots of similar games that clog the CPU. Music in the game fits it well, and doesn't get tiresome after a while of playing. The physics are of course really arcade-ish, but driving is fun! And so is killing things - especially since you have a bunch of different cars to choose, that actually doesn't make you feel you're using the same car with different skin. The game is well-polished, that's a plus too. The menus are nice, there's no (many :D) bugs in it, achievements fun to earn.One ""drawback"" of the game, is that's in fact a casual game. It's not challenging, there's not much to do, so I'd say it's a casual game. The other minus is that pretty much noone plays multiplayer, so you're bound to play with your friends or single player.Anyway, I totally recomment the game, especially at it's low price!

												I can honestly say, when I first saw this game I thought ""Hey, it's on sale and it's gotta beat sitting around doing nothing!"" Instead of finding one of those games that you play just to kill time when you're absolutely bored, I found a game that surprisingly enough is a lot of fun. The Death Race mentality and the simple wacked out insanity of the vehicles makes for a fun game, and the maps are well done as well. On a scale of 1-10 I would be able to rate this an 8 and be satisfied. The online feature that allows you to race (and destroy) other people reminded me of Burnout so much. I can honestly say screw Need for Speed, I'll take this anyday!			",131,18,1,26,26,0,23

												I think that PAM is in fact quite underrated. I wasn't expecting much from it, but playing the game was a real fun!Graphics are really nice, and it runs very smooth on my PC, unlike lots of similar games that clog the CPU. Music in the game fits it well, and doesn't get tiresome after a while of playing. The physics are of course really arcade-ish, but driving is fun! And so is killing things - especially since you have a bunch of different cars to choose, that actually doesn't make you feel you're using the same car with different skin. The game is well-polished, that's a plus too. The menus are nice, there's no (many :D) bugs in it, achievements fun to earn.One ""drawback"" of the game, is that's in fact a casual game. It's not challenging, there's not much to do, so I'd say it's a casual game. The other minus is that pretty much noone plays multiplayer, so you're bound to play with your friends or single player.Anyway, I totally recomment the game, especially at it's low price!

												I still owe this game a review, so I think it's time to write one. PAM is a vehicular combat arcade, and that word combination describes it quite neatly. Your primary goal is to destroy your opponents by means of weapons installed on your post-apocalyptic car. I shall underline it again, because it's not immediately clear from media files and game description: this is NOT a race. It does not matter if you come first or last: the winner is the player who killed more enemies (and got more points, consequently).All cars and weapons are available from the very beginning, there's no profile development and no campaign mode. Some of the most dangerous cars are locked, though; you will need to buy the DLC to open access to them. You will be able to make an informed decision, because the AI always has access to all cars - there'll be the chance for you to fight against DLC cars, watch their weapons in action, and decide whether you need them or not.Any car has three weapons: front, side, and rear. They are more or less balanced, but different: each one is useful in its own certain situation, so there's no universal solution fitting for any track. When you start the fight, you don't have any weapon available; you need to activate them by picking barrels distributed throughout the track, and after you have used a certain weapon once, it is deactivated again, until the next barrel. Tracks are very peculiar, both in terms of scenery and of layout. A bit of physics is included, but it's not very realistic (so far as it's an arcade).Don't expect too much of a game where ice cream refrigerators kill others by giant ice cream balls falling from their rear door, and small pink cars with ponies on their hood flood the road with dozens of teddy bears filled with explosives. Just have fun and enjoy the mayhem and chaos you wreak along with other horrible, rusty, freaky cars that had somehow survived the unknown apocalypse.			",77,8,2,22,8,0,5

												In short: Post Apocalyptic Mayhem (PAM) is a combat racing game where the players race ad-hoc battle machines through various sandblasted locales, with the ultimate goal being to rack up as many kills as possible within five minutes.Since this is a driving game, lets talk about the vehicles first. Generally speaking, the smaller the vehicle, the more ""zippy"" and easier-to-control it feels. Larger vehicles trade in control for weapon power and the ability to take a beating. Not exactly the most original concept, but it's reliable and makes perfect sense within the apocalyptic setting.The driving mechanics themselves do not do a good job of conveying a sense of speed. Even when using Nitrous, you're never going to feel like you're breaching 50 MPH - as a result, when you manage to catch some big air in a race, it's going to feel like your vehicle has very ""floaty"" physics. As a veteran player of Dethkarz, Re-Volt, Trackmania and Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed, this strongly irritates me. On the plus side, there is very little overlap between each vehicle's unique weapons. There are four types of weapon pickups you can collect, each color reponding to either extra fuel for your boost meter, or front-facing, side-facing, and rear-facing weapons. Though most side-weapons tend to be ""a bunch of miniature bombs"", the front and rear weapons are almost always totally unique for each vehicle. As a result of each vehicle requiring a different playstyle, there is actually a huge amount of strategy in picking which vehicle you'll use during a race. I've become rather fond of the Nucloid vehicle myself.The overall level design is very, very good. There are six unique tracks, and a seventh Christmas-themed reskin of the first track.  Each level contains wide-open spaces, chokepoints, and multiple routes. Very rarely will there be a part of the track where you can't come up with a plan on-the-fly. My one complaint track-wise is that three of the game's tracks - Wasteland, Cold War Beach, and Airplane Cemetary - all have very bland aesthetics. The latter two have some interesting architecture, but Winter Wasteland is about ten times more interesting than regular Wasteland despite being little more than a reskin. The other tracks - Urban Jungle, Death Area 8, Abandoned Sawmill, and (again) Winter Wasteland have far more interesting aesthetics and are generally more fun to race on as a result.The soundtrack is... generic. Though the genre of each background song varies, they really don't add anything to the overall feel of the game. Once again, the exception being Winter Wasteland's background music, which is actually pretty damn epic for a Carol of the Bells remix.The A.I. in this game can actually be surprisingly skilled, though there is just a touch of rubberbanding involved in their programming. Playing on hard difficulty can result in most players earning an average score of around eight kills (which is a hell of a lot). Though you'll find virtually no online games being hosted, going a few rounds with friends is when this game shines at it's brightest.If this game happens to go on sale for a decent price, I urge you to give it a shot. It's not Twisted Metal, but it is a fun romp nonetheless. 7.0 \ 10 ",224,58,20,23,23,2,40

												Post Apocalyptic Mayhem (PAM) is Steam's Twisted Metal, but on a budget scale.Motor vehicles collide in an epic game of weapons, cunning, and destruction.You have the selection of a great number of vehicles, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Glowing orbs scattered all over the arena must be picked up in order to do the 3 directional attacks: Front attack (yellow orb), back attack (red orb), and sideways attack (blue orb). The turbo orb (green) only serves to give the player a speed boost. The vehicle weight is also considered; heavier motors can ram smaller ones for damage!I definitely recommend this game.

												Well, P.A.M. is typical arcade race which is done quite inaccurately. Also there are just 6 or 7 tracks and  one game mode (typical laps race with one but, SCORE - each kill give some points, who gets the most kills and is not the least wins). First few hours it's even fun and satisfying, but later it gets boring and monotonous. Of course there is about 12 cars and DLC (2€) which adds 3 more, but all of them are nothing special and after two rounds they start annoy. So if you searching a race game for an hour or two then this game can be not bad choice, but if you really need something for a longer time then just skip it. reVote  5/10			",471,121,17,62,29,8,63

The problem is that you can't get yourself into the game because of the constant crashing.Overall, great game but the crashing is a real issue. Is it worth the price? Well... It all depends on the gamer... Personally, I wouldn't pay more then five bucks or less.			",394,104,23,44,32,3,30

												This game is a decent engine, with potential, but also ♥♥♥♥ed up and stupid. Each ""race"" lasts three minutes, no more, no less. You score so many more points for kills than you do for completing laps that there's literally no point in trying to race, and it just feels dumb as hell deliberately going slow in a ""racing"" game just so enemies can catch up so you can maybe kill them. If this game was arena-based, it'd probably own a bit, or if it was like Daytona or something where you get additional time for kills and laps, that'd also be cool. But instead it's not that cool, and in fact almost kinda sucks.			",417,119,19,45,80,10,93

												after a couple of dlc's and some free maps added after the fact, I can honestly say that this game is worth the 10$  I spent on it.Fun little combat racer .Cross between Twisted Metal and Motor-Storm Apocalypse			",488,97,11,36,33,6,68

												This game is a decent engine, with potential, but also ♥♥♥♥ed up and stupid. Each ""race"" lasts three minutes, no more, no less. You score so many more points for kills than you do for completing laps that there's literally no point in trying to race, and it just feels dumb as hell deliberately going slow in a ""racing"" game just so enemies can catch up so you can maybe kill them. If this game was arena-based, it'd probably own a bit, or if it was like Daytona or something where you get additional time for kills and laps, that'd also be cool. But instead it's not that cool, and in fact almost kinda sucks.			",417,119,19,45,80,10,93

												Aaargggh, too much bloom effects !! That was my first impression when I first started playing this game.  For a brand new game, with decent graphics, nothing high end, why use this much bloom ? Anyway, it's a bit like Wipeout, or Carmageddon without the pedestrian killing. You race around and try to kill each other. There are power-ups to be collected and they're specific to the car you're driving. So one car drops mines, the other shoots chemicals for example. Using the same power-up. It's pretty fun. But to be honest, there are better games around.[Rating: 72/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												And coming in from the sinfully cheap indie game corner, comes another contestant, which tries to mix the awesome Carmaggedon formula with horrible graphics, annoying throttle sound and physics worthy of a japanese cartoon. The game looks really great. And by really great I mean someone took FlatOut, smeared lip vaseline all over it and then sprayed twenty boxes of neon graffity on the mess. It is almost painful to look. It doesn't help that the main menu looks like something you would get from a happy meal.The music is... Well... Give me a second... Erm... Is there any music in this game anyway? Sorry, I won't bother turning it on for the sake of writing a recommendation, but if there IS any music, it is bland, uninspiring and almost annoying - the type of ""music"" you would make by mashing two metal dumpster lids together while shouting: ""Old MacDonald had a farm"" out of rythm. The fake sound of engine on full throttle doesn't help that much either - it sounds twice worse than a four year old immitating a F-1 engine sound - and six times as annoying.The gameplay is so much FUN! Well, it WOULD be, if you wouldn't get bored after three minutes. There are like 8 or something cars, with 4 more if you are willing to shell out cash. (Please don't. Please. Give the DLC money to charity or something, just don't buy the DLC). The cars differ visually, sure, but SLIGHTLY by stats, and really little by abilities - instead of yellow waste, you shoot green booze, omigosh. Although the idea of anything-goes wipeout racing is really great, this game manages to eff it up anyway. There are 4 powerups in the game - your front attack, your back attack, your side attack and nitro. You get those in kind of a Mario Kart principle. And that's it. There is literally 0 depth here. Like, if you look at the game's storepage for four and a half seconds, you MASTERED IT! Congratulations. There won't be any cake. You might think that the if you manage to cross the finish line first, you win. But no. You need to get the most KILLS! Sure. Next time in the Olympics, we will cheer for the sprinter who stabbed the most athletes in the neck. Basically, it all comes down to stupid, no strategy involved carnage. And not the good type of carnage, where you kick a table into a window and break the window, the table AND a poor passerby in slow-motion. This is the type of carnage where you and seven other freaks on a 7 year steroid-only diet have a race to punch a brick wall and the first who breaks his arm completely wins. A free trip to a hospital.Please, don't even consider this game. It's painful to play (figuratively), it's painful to write about (literally, my arm has been cut and every single word I write is out of the sheer willpower that this game must not reach the hands of fellow citi-gaaaaaaaaaaaah. Sorry. I'm bleeding. I should stop now). The idea was good, but it's burried somewhere in between the lipstick-smeared graphics, ear-bleeding noise, fatally boring gameplay and all the blood that's coming out of my arm.

												Bad racing game. The combat mechanics are all right, but no car has enough speed to actually race properly. You get punished for being too far out in front, because 1st place doesn't matter if you're on the same amount of laps as someone else, and they have more kills then you. The physics engine sucks major♥♥♥♥♥ One tiny clip on another car, and you're spent spiraling through the air, which is hard to recover from. All objects on the track are hard stops, forcing you to reverse (Which is incredibly slow), and try to manoveur your way around it. TL;DR bad physics engine, racing doesn't matter if you can't kill anything. Not a game  for race fans, or casual gamers.			",111,22,0,8,7,1,14

												Gameplay is broken. Probably, bots were too slow to compete player in racing. So developers made that you don't need to race. In game where maps are racing circuits. Yet bots do race. Scoring are based on number of kills, and technically on number of laps completed, but latter has almost no impact on score. To win you just get away a bit, collect weapons and spam rear attack. Or don't try hard and just have a fun.And multiplayer is even worse. Most of weapons are made so you use while racing. But because there's no point in it, they can be simply avoided by slowing down.I don't say adding a real race mode would make this game better. As I said, player who got away at start will spam rear attacks and he will be unbeatable.And I didn’t even mention graphics or awful handling (most first person shooters have better car physics). There is much better combat racing games on Steam. Head over to their direction. ",1599,515,169,180,173,25,207

												People that downplay this game never gave it a shot for what it is. It'll never be the best game in the world, and it isn't trying to be. It isn't even trying to be some ultra-deep indie title. It's a fun little racing game where you blow crap up. The number of tracks is VERY limited, so be prepared for that. There's really only one game mode, so be prepared for that. The driving isn't ""Realistic"", the cars handle more like Mario Karts than they do cars, be prepared for that. The graphics and sound aren't top notch, so be prepared for that.So why do I still recommend it? It's a fun game. It doesn't try too hard. The graphics and sound are cartoony and get the job done. It has a sense of humor. The controsl and gameplay is very tight and fluid. So if you're looking for a fun time that you can keep coming back to when bored, check it out. If you're looking for a game you can sink hours and hours in a row into, this probably isn't it. Go into it not expecting too much and you might be pleasantly suprised.			",365,97,8,56,31,9,47

												Post Apocalyptic Mayhem lets you race and battle heavily-modified vehicles through numerous breathtaking tracks and lay waste to other racers in over-the-top vehicular mayhem. You can use special vehicle abilities to cause spectacular destruction to enemy cars as you fight and speed to victory. You’ll experience remarkable speeds, hilarious and violent weapons, reinforced vehicles and various exhilarating tracks. The game offers various intense race modes to allow you to showcase both your driving and battling skills. PAM features an accessible physics-based driving model that allows you to sense the immense speed of all the post apocalyptic vehicles as well as feel every bone-jarring impact from both weapons and the tracks. Play single-player or battle up to five friends in online multiplayer mode.			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

												This is a fun but simple and arcadey racing game.   It's a console port so graphics aren't anything amazing, but adequate.Unfortunately the bad side of console porting shows up, if you have any kind of game controller like a HOTAS plugged in, it assumes you're a console gamer and maps everything bizarrely everywhere and you can't change it, so the game is basically unplayable.Dear developers, if your game doesn't work without me needing to remove hardware from my system, because you're too lazy to do 5 minutes of research and discover PC gamers use mouse and keyboard predominantly, you get a thumbs down.

												Fun game, especially in multiplayer.  When I played it, there really was no online community.  Very limited content but it is worth the few dollars it is usually being sold for.

												If you like Super Mario Karts or Blur, you will like this game.  A very well done arcade adversarial race game that has alot of interesting twists in the action. Multiple vehicle types that offer different ways to bust up your competition. You cause damage to other drivers with the front, side or rear attack systems, plus there is the nitro powerup for speed boost.  You gain these attacks/abilities by driving into colored barrels to gain that certain ability. This is not a race to the finish line but rather a race to collect the most kills before time runs out. Great game, fair price and nice to look at, 9 to of 10,			",430,56,40,38,43,2,44

												Nice grindhouse style racer. Similar to the Twisted Metal or Vigilante 8 series, not quite as polished, but still fun. Driving mechanics are simple and a bit lacking in some areas. Overall worth checking out if you're looking for a good combat racer for PC.			",289,43,13,25,39,6,49

												P.A.M. is trying really hard to be Twisted Metal and Flat-Out at the same time. It's kind of a clever idea--the three-directional weapons just wouldn't work if the pack wasn't all headed in the same direction. But at the same time... it's more demolition-focused than race-focused, so rather than blazing down the track and leaving everybody behind... it's actually a better idea to slow down and keep them in weapons range. This takes some getting used to.			",268,41,4,39,11,2,32

This is in a Post Apocaliptic World, where there are a few crazy drivers!The tracks are creative, and if you get passed by a opponent, you can actually kill him, depending on wich car you are using!I say its okay, but I got a bit bored of it since I didn't see much feedback from other people playing this.

												This is one action packed arcade-style racing game. Loads of explosions, violence, and speed. The game looks good for it's year, and plays very well; to me at least. If keyboard is not your thing this has full controller compatibility. Each of the maps are also greatly different from each and give a nice variety of stages to play on. This game is basically a PC exclusive version of games like Full Auto or Motorstorm. If you enjoy those two games I would recommend picking this one up and get a group of friends to play with you. You won't regret it. Great game for the price, especially when the sales hit.			",344,59,15,15,8,2,15

												Bad game.It's designed as multiplayer only, but suffers from lack of content and balanbce issues. If someone else picks the car you want your are stuck with whatever is left (why? what reason did they have to restric classes?). Vehicles are extremely unbalanced, some being insanely slow and some being way too fast and completely useless otherwise. You cant win by being first, it's all about who makes the most frags, so why  have them being so different? Since levels are lap races you are either in first place with nothing to do or in last completely alone and with no way to catch up.There's also like 5 levels, and 6 or so cars, so it wont keep you busy for long.Veredict: Meh.

												The balance between the speed of the cars makes playing very difficult. The slow cars have almost no chance of catching the fast cars. The balance between laps and kills doesn't work well because leaders and trailers generally have very little opportunity to attack other cars. Additionally it is very had to visually tell where the track is supposed to lead.			",31,3,0,5,0,1,8

PAM is a funny racing destruction gamePAM is a surprisingly great and funny game built on a principle of Destruction Derbys. That means your goal is to race and destroy as many vehicles as you can. You have a lot of ways how to do it - you can use your driving skills (for example push the opponent from track or into other vehicle), front weapon you load when you collect a yellow barrel, side weapon loaded with blue barrel and rear weapon loaded with red barrel. So we all get what´s this game about, so I´ll write what I like and what I dislike about it so far:Advantages + Lots fo vehicles you can choose from. They differ not only in the boring statistics like speed, acceleration and other, but they are really funny and they all have custom weapon animations. For example little pink car, that has an unicorn horn as its front weapon or other car is thwrowing nuclear waste as ammo.+ The maps and tracks are well built. There are numerous ways where you can go, you can jump, trick or lay traps.+ It´s a real fun to play+ I haven´t played the multiplayer, but I think things could go really crazy when you play it together with your friends. I wish my friends have this game too!+ You could get it really cheap, there are lot of sales and you can buy a 3-pack for your friends too. This game could be often found in random steam keys too.Disadvantages- The game does not offer a lot of hours of playtime. The game goal does not change and in spite of the fact, that there are a lot of vehicles and tracks, there is no advancement as in other games. You can play all the cars from the beginning, you can ride all the maps. Everything is open. You don´t see any point of playing it sometimes (except it´s fun). So it´s great fun to play as a pause-filler but not as an full-time game.- The physics of the game are sometimes unrealistic. There is a bus and a little something, that looks like VW Beetle and the tiny Beetle could push the bus easy from the cliff. It seems like all the vehicles have the same power, the same weight in collisions. But when it comes to speed, handling, acceleration and breaking, everything seems to be ok and appropriate.

												Very fun awesome game this is. Reminds me of Mario kart a little racing along while picking up barrels unlocking weapons on your car to destroy the opponent. Game looks and runs great its just a shame that nobody really plays this anymore so there is not really many online racing but still the single player mode is still most enjoyable. Could have done with a few more cars and tracks but hey you cannot have everything. Thought it was a bargain at the 79p sale price i got it for including the DLC :) Good solid game i give it a 7.5/10   ( Ignore the Metacritic score )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An interesing little combat racer. Pick a vehicle, pick a track, drive and try to kill everyone else. Most kills+laps wins. So, if you're looking for some overall story or plot... it ain't here. No, really. There is no story, so stop looking!The vehicles are unique as far as weapons and apperances go, and each handles somewhat different than the others. The tracks are well planned and often have several routes you can take, some of which can let you jump ahead.Downside is there's no tutorial. Not that you really need one, but it'd be nice if something, a tooltip pop-up maybe, told you how weapons work and got you used to that aspect of the game. FYI, weapons need to be collected from the colored barrels around the track in order to be used; Y for your front weapon, X for the sides and B for back. You can also only store one 'charge' at a time, so it's no use trying to stockpile.Also, there aren't a whole lot of tracks and cars, and using a controller is a big must. But if you want something you can play with a few friends in order to let out some aggression in a non-FPS manner, split the cost of the 3-pack and go blow some♥♥♥♥♥♥up.			",195,24,4,39,15,4,21

												To put it shortly, the game needs improvement. But I feel like it can be a great game with a few updates. When I'm driving through the courses, my vehicle gets snagged a lot on the scenery: a pole here, a rock I thought I could jump, a piece of the tunnel that was juuuust enough to my side that it stops my car. The game needs to be more forgiving here, since the scenery makes the difference between 1st and last place. Another thing that I feel should be fixed is the sensitivity. Now I don't know if it's just my computer having this problem, but a little tap to the left in my vehicle  goes a long way. Too long. My vehicle can get kind of unpredictable at times. However I can deal with this sort of by being careful. Now, the things I liked. I really dig the diesel-punk vibe I'm getting from this game. The menu is just a blast and the music fits. The courses look pretty cool and fits the whole apocalypse theme. Another aspect is the gameplay: points are won by completing laps and killing the most people. This two pronged point system gives playing the game a kind of edge that I like. The vehicle selection is pretty cool too. We got a policecar, a unicorn with a B.A. drill horn in the front, and a logging truck that spills logs onto the track. It's pretty cool.One thing that I might suggest as new material is to let the player demolish the course as they drive. Like if I ram into the train hanger in the Wastelands, I'd go through it and come out the other side. And what if one gets points by doing that? Like if you take down a section of freeway you'd get a lot of points compared to taking out a shipping container. And then you'd be thinking of three ways to get points in the game, making it more of a challenge. To sum up, the game needs improvements but there are many parts of it I enjoyed. 6/10			",62,20,0,10,5,0,15

												It's a shame more people don't play this, it's actually quiet a lot of fun and I enjoyed playing it, if you liked Twisted Metal this game is very similar. If it's on sale or having a Free Weekend, I'd recommend picking it up, but it's not nearly as fun without multiplayer, so unless you can find friends who like it or a sale that encourages more people play it, it's like missing a large part of what makes it fun. I think it's a highly underrated game.			",322,158,2,52,12,2,11

												This game is essentially a lighter version of ""Twisted Metal"".It has little selection of tracks and cars (there's one DLC, maybe it helps). Though, each car has unique set of weapons which actually can change the way you play, that's nice. But. unfortunately this also brings huge unbalance to the game, as some cars are obviously better than others. Game physics is quite poor.To summarise, should be played only in a company of half-drunk friends. Has no value as far as single-player or competitive multiplayer goes. Not sure if porting this to PC (hope it was developed for consoles) was a good idea at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game looks very nice. That's pretty much the only positive thing I can say about it.Gameplay is horribly boring and broken, the racing aspect is useless, as the only thing that matters to win the match is scoring more kills. You do that by driving a little bit ahead of the stupid AI pack, dropping some weapons behind you, waiting for the cars to explode, rinsing and repeating. The physics is horrible, cars handle unpredictably and hitting any minor bump or rock on the road can make your car spin weirdly in the air for no apparent reason.There is only one pointless game mode - no story, no progression, no goals or unlocks - just pick one of the tiny selection of tracks and play a pointless ""race"" where being in the lead makes no difference, since all matches last for a fixed 5-minute timer.It's a shame, this game shows a lot of promise, but as it is I couldn't consider it more than a barely playable prototype.

												This game brings back some really good memories of Twisted Metal (PS1) and Vigilante 8 (PS1) and Mario Kart (SNES), but it doesn't quite work like them. It's more or less a racing game, except it isn't the main aspect of the game. You can still win even if you don't race at all, you score points by either completing laps or killing enemies, the one with higher score at the end of the timer wins.Each vehicle has its own three unique weapons and each weapon works and feels different from each other. Physics is realistic except for the gravity, it's a little low for Earth. Sound effects are good, soundtracks fit in nice. Also, this game was made thinking of Xbox controllers, please do use those! They work awesome on this game.I recommend this game if you have a bunch of friends to play with.			",303,47,1,25,17,0,32

												PAM is a MarioKart-style racing game with an emphasis on attacking other racers. The races I played were fun enough... I found the vehicles easy enough to handle (I crashed a few times, but still stayed with the pack regardless). The attack options are unfortunately limited. You have three types of short-range attacks, which really doesn't feel like enough for a game where you win by attacking.The complete lack of tutorial surprised me. The complete lack of a single-player campaign really surprised me. The unfortunate thing about this game is that there is very little incentive to keep playing. There are a few unlocked cars and achievements, but that's it.Don't even consider PAM for single-player alone unless you really want MarioKart (any of them), but can't get it. This game can only really be worthwhile in multiplayer, and even then, MarioKart is a more enjoyable experience with far better weapons. I won't say that PAM isn't fun, but I will say it's not worth the money spent.			",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

    Disclaimer:   The following review is valid as of the December 16, 2011 update.  While it's unlikely that any further releases will come, keep in mind that this could be outdated by any further patches to the game.  Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is a car combat game set in — you guessed it— a post-apocalyptic world. Players take control of one of 9 oddball vehicles (12, if you fork over for the DLC, Chaos Pack) and battle it out over 7 sufficiently desolate tracks.The player has four powers available to them: a forward attack to ram their foes, an attack from left and right to side-swipe opponents, a rear attack to lay traps for unsuspecting pursuers, and a depleting boost power to catch up to the competition. The objective of single-player is simple— kill the most opponents to win the race. Doing so requires driving over color-coordinated barrels to power attacks, and then unleashing them on enemies. Combat is fairly satisfying, particularly when accomplishing a revenge kill, or when a kill notification pops up from the traps left in a vehicle's wake.Both keyboard and controller are supported; indeed, PAM seems to have been built around the use of a controller, such that I wouldn't be surprised if I were told that this was an XBLA port. In fact, not much effort seems to have been placed into the keyboard control scheme, as the vibrant 360 button colors representing powered attacks on the HUD, a perfectly suitable UI indicator if using a controller, remain largely unaltered for their keyboard counterparts.  A minor quibble, to be sure, and notable only for the impression it gives.There are only two modes to choose from, though it could be argued that there's really only one: regular kill-based races in Arcade mode, and the marathon version, Apocalyptic Challenge mode.  This means you better really enjoy the handful of tracks and the base game, because Apocalyptic Challenge is simply Arcade Mode with no pause between maps.  Therefore, don't expect a mode devoted to racing, no matter how fun or obvious that might seem, as it's only present in the multiplayer.Speaking of which: there are only seven tracks, as previously stated, one of which is a festive reskin of the first. Admittedly, each is stylized appropriately to fit their given theme, and are varied enough (save the reskin) not to be repetitive between maps.  The cars fair a little better, with nine/twelve vehicles to choose from, each with different stats and unique abilities.There's no narrative element to the game, unless one counts the blurbs for each of the racers. I'm not expecting some grand, magnum opus, mind. However, the side effect to no explanation for the surprisingly controlled, accommodating chaos is that the racers don't come to life at all. In fact, one wouldn't be remiss for thinking that PAM was a hardcore alternate reality of Cars™, as the player never actually sees the person behind the wheel. A step in the right direction would have been to model the racers of each of the automobiles, even if only as a flat image by the vehicles. Another, would have been to provide a motivation, a “carrot-on-a-stick,” for why these racers have chosen to participate, instead of taking their insanity out on the vulnerable remaining post-apocalyptic population.Achievement hounds will find no satisfaction here without a little help from their friends; a fair amount of them revolve around the game's multiplayer, which is a veritable ghost track. One such award also  requires interaction with someone not on your friends list; a problem for the aforementioned reason. This is another negative to level in the game's direction, as the achievements and the lack of modes give the impression that multiplayer was meant to be an integral part of the game experience. A solution for this would have been to allow for completely bot-ed multiplayer when the prospects had all dried up, maybe with unique AI to differentiate them from Arcade mode. Perhaps that would be defeating the purpose, but I would argue the same for a multiplayer mode that has no players. Another, perhaps more practical solution, would have been to focus on the multiplayer or single-player to provide a solid experience from one or the other, rather than a middling/minimal experience from both.The sound design is decent, if not memorable. The music is a standard, instrumental rock affair, including a rocked out version of Jingle Bells on the “Winter Wasteland” track. Sound effects, such as the winding of the engines and blasts from weapons fire, don't seem out of place.The graphics are average; they're not going to break even a modestly equipped rig, but they're not blindingly awful, either.   The themes of individual tracks are represented well enough. Each of the vehicle's attacks have interesting visual effects unique to them, as well. Glowing spots on vehicles indicate if an opponent has an attack powered up or not— a nice, practical touch . The explosions can be satisfying, but they often obstruct the player's vision, obscuring the view of any potential traps laid out, and rendering damage and obstacle avoidance to hit-or-miss.Ultimately, I don't recommend this game.  It's a combat racing game on a budget, and it shows in the lukewarm delivery of the single-player and multiplayer modes, and hand-me-down, controller-based UI.  That's not to say it doesn't have its merits; I'm not well-versed in Steam's car combat offerings, but I'll guess that there aren't many available at PAM's on-sale price point, so if you're itching for a vehicular action game and need a quick fix, this could be your thing.  And if you were already planning to play this with friends, I could see you easily getting your money's worth with the multiplayer, provided you didn't expect to have any fun with it when your friends aren't available.

												If you like Super Mario Karts or Blur, you will like this game.  A very well done arcade adversarial race game that has alot of interesting twists in the action. Multiple vehicle types that offer different ways to bust up your competition. You cause damage to other drivers with the front, side or rear attack systems, plus there is the nitro powerup for speed boost.  You gain these attacks/abilities by driving into colored barrels to gain that certain ability. This is not a race to the finish line but rather a race to collect the most kills before time runs out.

												Do you like Arcade racers? Check! Post-Apocalyptic Setting? Check! Exploding flamingo launchers? Check..? This racer isn’t for everyone but it is a solid, budget-priced racing game that is a blast to play with a group of friends. The best way to describe it is Mario Kart meets Vigilante 8. There are 6 different rides, each with their own set of abilities and stats. As you race, colored barrels are placed throughout the map and when picked up, they charge the corresponding abilities. The main mode’s objective is to kill the most opponents as well as try to finish in first place. Currently there are only 3 maps with 4 different game modes, as well as a bot control single player. With free dlc on the way (2 new vehicles and 1 track) 9.99 isn’t much to ask for the amount of chaos and cheap tricks that ensue. Just don’t go into the game expecting a deep racing experience, you do get what you pay for.			",168,35,1,18,10,2,22

												There is nothing really wrong with this game but it just wasn't what I was looking for.  The tracks are fine but nothing memorable.  The cars were interesting but I grew tired of them quickly.  The racing is kind of pointless as killing other cars gives you more points toward winning.  The combat, which is what I was craving, grew tiresome quickly as well.  Basically find a power up, line up a car to the front, side or rear depending on which you have and kill the opponent fairly easily.  Not a whole lot of strategy and each car plays almost the same.  The tracks are all independent and the only point is to get the most points you can.  There is no choosing weapons, no campaign mode, nothing to keep me coming back.  In small doses it can be fun but that is all it is good for.  I was just hoping for a little more.			",323,88,1,122,70,2,140

												I don't really see this game as a meta 44 i'd give it way higher least 65 not as bad as that metascore I'm thinking who ever gave that score didn't turn bloom off yes i recommend you do aswell because it's liike 1st generation bloom reminds me of smearing vasaline on my pc screen once I turned it off i actually enjoyed the game. Where it's nothing orginol really played games just like it in playstation 1 days. But it was worth the $1.18 I gave for it+dlc. Just arcade car combat racing game not much racing to it just spam power ups kill as much as you want (or more than a.i. and you will win always lol). It's super easy on easy dificulty I found myself waiting on the A.I. many times so would be good game for younger kids keep him/her occupied outta mommy n daddies hair for little while lol. Game don't really have any story theres campeign but no story like that backing it up pretty simple and shallow game.  GFX seem 2007ish to me. While not bad just nothing blingy. But yea i recommend this game when you can get it for $2 or less. Can't even buy a 30 second candy bar for $2 lol.Edit btw you make about 30% of what you spent if you sell the trading cards lol so really you could about get this game for free.

It is a racing game with elements of vehicle shoting game!  It could be better of course, since AI is kinda weird, also steering and physics aro not that great, but overal its not bad.Alternative is to play Gass Guzlers Extreme.			",74,6,3,1,1,2,4

												I love car combat games, and I love games that cut the crap and get straight to the action. PAM is both. It's actually rather different from other combat racers I've played, and there is great diversity among the six availible cars. It could use more then it's paltry three tracks, but even then those three tracks are large and very well made. It's very easy to pick up and the affordable price means fans of car combat shouldn't pass this one up. There seems to be DLC cars and maybe tracks on the way, so they only thing it really needs some kind of co-op mode.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

												You don't need this game. Plain and simple. It's not fun, there are much better alternatives all over steam, it's multiplayer -as expected- is always lifeless as a junkyard. It's graphics and level design is bad, even if you think you don't care about that, it's a arcade racing game, it could look much better, and I'm not even mentioning it's awful controls. AVOID IT.

												This is a very fun Post Apocalyptic racing game. Weapons differ depending on what vehicle you are driving, and for each car there are 3 weapons, the front weapon, side weapons (Activate at the same time), and rear weapons. All of the vehicles have their own quirks, for say, a school bus will have more health than a dune buggy (and yes, you can drive both of those). So overall, I give this a 9/10, there are a couple bugs but nothing game breaking, hope you guys get as much enjoyment as I did.			",301,57,40,27,50,0,32

												What would happen if Mario Kart got crossbreeded with a demolishion derby?! THEN-, you would uh, probably get the already existing game Jak X... ...BUT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PS2 AT THE MOMENT, YOU WOULD GET THE POST APOCALYPTIC MAYHEM!!Ahem, PAM is an intense racing warfare game where you do not compete for the first place. You compete for the most kills through an arsenal of wacky weapons, all depending on your chosen vehicle (who all have some kind of inspiration or theme).+ The selection of vehicles and their weapons who each demands specific tactics and strategies where not one is like another.+ I highly recommend playing PAM with a controller, when all your attacks are based on the 360 Controller's right buttonpad (Y,B,A,X) with A as your nitro, B, as your rear weapon, X as your sideweapons and Y for frontal mowing. So natural!+ The immersive tracks and stages is very fluid and are quick to learn the ups and downs in. One of them is just a lying eight, how rad is that?! - Sometime when you hit a obstacle or get thrown in high speed, your car turns into a helium filled balloon and flies all over the place which VERY QUICKLY can get on your nerves. The game prays that you get over it and keeps playing though.- Griefers could hide out at choke points just to have unsuspecting racers drive right into his just placed minefield or something like that. FRUSTRATION INDUCED.PAM has its rad parts and its bad parts but overall, I'm having a fun time with this controlled demolishion racer. I give it 7 / 10			",137,4,0,4,6,0,4

												P.A.M. is trying really hard to be Twisted Metal and Flat-Out at the same time. It's kind of a clever idea--the three-directional weapons just wouldn't work if the pack wasn't all headed in the same direction. But at the same time... it's more demolition-focused than race-focused, so rather than blazing down the track and leaving everybody behind... it's actually a better idea to slow down and keep them in weapons range. This takes some getting used to.			",268,41,4,39,11,2,32

												Yea: Kart style racing without the cartoony feelMeh: The game is easy on all difficulties, the tracks are interesting and fun. Vehicle choice is very good.Bleh!: There is no real variety in weapons as they are unique per vehicle and handle pretty much vehicle to vehicle with minor differences. The racing controls and physics are God awful and you will have your car flying every where trying to gain control, its just too out there to be fun. And alas while there is a good selection of vehicles they all lack any kind of personality.Verdict:T he controls/physics as well as the lack of character make this a below mediocre kart racer, with only redeeming quality is the tracks. I can only recomend it if you can find it for dirt dirt cheap.*/5			",439,123,12,73,77,7,70

												For anyone that has played twisted metal, vigilante 8, and games as such where you choose between different cars with different abilities, with the main goal being to race and/or crush your opponents. This is the game for you. It is especially fun if you're playing against your friends, and has really good level designs. Some things that this game lacks is more levels, and different modes. The levels and modes that are there are quite good, but after a while you will probably wish there were more. There are DLC packs that add extra vehicles, so there are plenty of play styles to choose from.			",587,138,9,71,27,4,23

If it's on sale or having a Free Weekend, I'd recommend picking it up, but it's not nearly as fun without multiplayer, so unless you can find friends who like it or a sale that encourages more people play it, it's like missing a large part of what makes it fun. I think it's a highly underrated game.			",322,158,2,52,12,2,11

												I am really happy with this game. I got it with a DLC at 90% sale. It cost almost nothing. I have tried it out like, okay, don't expect much from it, just have some fun. But I actually had waaay more fun with it than much more games. The reason is that it's just fun. Don't think more to this. But it is fun in the best way. With friends it would be interesting too (send me friend invite if you would like to play).  Good: -runs great in low computers -crazy cars -nice tracks -multiplayer -style    Bad: -low number of tracksFor my price- 9/10    For 10 euro (+dlc price) 7/10			",186,22,15,12,16,2,6

												This game was gifted to me and as a fan or racing games I was more than willing to give it a try. 2 of my friends and I got together online and tried a few tracks out and some cars. Going into the first turn weapons a blazing from human player and PC AI alike mass hysteria ensued. I made it through the mess and took off with a commanding lead. Out running my opponents by leagues I notice I am in last as its not who wins this race its who has the most kills when this race is over. So of course I begin to slow down and let the others catch me. Only to be immediately killed. This game has many quirks and mistakes but when played with some friends its worth a few rounds.

												There is nothing really wrong with this game but it just wasn't what I was looking for.  The tracks are fine but nothing memorable.  The cars were interesting but I grew tired of them quickly.  The racing is kind of pointless as killing other cars gives you more points toward winning.  The combat, which is what I was craving, grew tiresome quickly as well.  Basically find a power up, line up a car to the front, side or rear depending on which you have and kill the opponent fairly easily.  Not a whole lot of strategy and each car plays almost the same.  The tracks are all independent and the only point is to get the most points you can.  There is no choosing weapons, no campaign mode, nothing to keep me coming back.  In small doses it can be fun but that is all it is good for.  I was just hoping for a little more.			",323,88,1,122,70,2,140

												For anyone that has played twisted metal, vigilante 8, and games as such where you choose between different cars with different abilities, with the main goal being to race and/or crush your opponents. This is the game for you. It is especially fun if you're playing against your friends, and has really good level designs. Some things that this game lacks is more levels, and different modes. The levels and modes that are there are quite good, but after a while you will probably wish there were more. There are DLC packs that add extra vehicles, so there are plenty of play styles to choose from.			",587,138,9,71,27,4,23

												Do you like Arcade racers? Check! Post-Apocalyptic Setting? Check! Exploding flamingo launchers? Check..? This racer isn’t for everyone but it is a solid, budget-priced racing game that is a blast to play with a group of friends. The best way to describe it is Mario Kart meets Vigilante 8. There are 6 different rides, each with their own set of abilities and stats. As you race, colored barrels are placed throughout the map and when picked up, they charge the corresponding abilities. The main mode’s objective is to kill the most opponents as well as try to finish in first place. Currently there are only 3 maps with 4 different game modes, as well as a bot control single player. With free dlc on the way (2 new vehicles and 1 track) 9.99 isn’t much to ask for the amount of chaos and cheap tricks that ensue. Just don’t go into the game expecting a deep racing experience, you do get what you pay for.			",168,35,1,18,10,2,22

												Fun racing game where having the highest number of kills makes you a winner, not the most laps. Good selection of vehicles, each with their own attributes & weapons. Single player is against AI which  gets you used to the gameplay before going online (although I find the AI drives a bit slow at times, even on hardest difficulty). Finding matches online can be a problem as there aren't really enough players at this time, best bet is to join a couple of P.A.M. groups & organise a game through them.			",413,119,60,53,48,11,52

												I first played this game when it was free for a weekend and I felt that at the end of the weekend I had got as much enjoyment out of the game as I was going to. Later I ended up buying it when it was so cheap I couldn't resist. There is nothing wrong with this game but it doesn't do anything to stand out either. There is a nice wide range of vehicles which each have their own unique weapons and the gameplay is fun. However there is a disappointing limited selection of tracks. I suspect the multiplayer would be good fun but there is no splitscreen mode and I don't want to play with randoms on the internet.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

    Disclaimer:   The following review is valid as of the December 16, 2011 update.  While it's unlikely that any further releases will come, keep in mind that this could be outdated by any further patches to the game.  Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is a car combat game set in — you guessed it— a post-apocalyptic world. Players take control of one of 9 oddball vehicles (12, if you fork over for the DLC, Chaos Pack) and battle it out over 7 sufficiently desolate tracks.The player has four powers available to them: a forward attack to ram their foes, an attack from left and right to side-swipe opponents, a rear attack to lay traps for unsuspecting pursuers, and a depleting boost power to catch up to the competition. The objective of single-player is simple— kill the most opponents to win the race. Doing so requires driving over color-coordinated barrels to power attacks, and then unleashing them on enemies. Combat is fairly satisfying, particularly when accomplishing a revenge kill, or when a kill notification pops up from the traps left in a vehicle's wake.Both keyboard and controller are supported; indeed, PAM seems to have been built around the use of a controller, such that I wouldn't be surprised if I were told that this was an XBLA port. In fact, not much effort seems to have been placed into the keyboard control scheme, as the vibrant 360 button colors representing powered attacks on the HUD, a perfectly suitable UI indicator if using a controller, remain largely unaltered for their keyboard counterparts.  A minor quibble, to be sure, and notable only for the impression it gives.There are only two modes to choose from, though it could be argued that there's really only one: regular kill-based races in Arcade mode, and the marathon version, Apocalyptic Challenge mode.  This means you better really enjoy the handful of tracks and the base game, because Apocalyptic Challenge is simply Arcade Mode with no pause between maps.  Therefore, don't expect a mode devoted to racing, no matter how fun or obvious that might seem, as it's only present in the multiplayer.Speaking of which: there are only seven tracks, as previously stated, one of which is a festive reskin of the first. Admittedly, each is stylized appropriately to fit their given theme, and are varied enough (save the reskin) not to be repetitive between maps.  The cars fair a little better, with nine/twelve vehicles to choose from, each with different stats and unique abilities.There's no narrative element to the game, unless one counts the blurbs for each of the racers. I'm not expecting some grand, magnum opus, mind. However, the side effect to no explanation for the surprisingly controlled, accommodating chaos is that the racers don't come to life at all. In fact, one wouldn't be remiss for thinking that PAM was a hardcore alternate reality of Cars™, as the player never actually sees the person behind the wheel. A step in the right direction would have been to model the racers of each of the automobiles, even if only as a flat image by the vehicles. Another, would have been to provide a motivation, a “carrot-on-a-stick,” for why these racers have chosen to participate, instead of taking their insanity out on the vulnerable remaining post-apocalyptic population.Achievement hounds will find no satisfaction here without a little help from their friends; a fair amount of them revolve around the game's multiplayer, which is a veritable ghost track. One such award also  requires interaction with someone not on your friends list; a problem for the aforementioned reason. This is another negative to level in the game's direction, as the achievements and the lack of modes give the impression that multiplayer was meant to be an integral part of the game experience. A solution for this would have been to allow for completely bot-ed multiplayer when the prospects had all dried up, maybe with unique AI to differentiate them from Arcade mode. Perhaps that would be defeating the purpose, but I would argue the same for a multiplayer mode that has no players. Another, perhaps more practical solution, would have been to focus on the multiplayer or single-player to provide a solid experience from one or the other, rather than a middling/minimal experience from both.The sound design is decent, if not memorable. The music is a standard, instrumental rock affair, including a rocked out version of Jingle Bells on the “Winter Wasteland” track. Sound effects, such as the winding of the engines and blasts from weapons fire, don't seem out of place.The graphics are average; they're not going to break even a modestly equipped rig, but they're not blindingly awful, either.   The themes of individual tracks are represented well enough. Each of the vehicle's attacks have interesting visual effects unique to them, as well. Glowing spots on vehicles indicate if an opponent has an attack powered up or not— a nice, practical touch . The explosions can be satisfying, but they often obstruct the player's vision, obscuring the view of any potential traps laid out, and rendering damage and obstacle avoidance to hit-or-miss.Ultimately, I don't recommend this game.  It's a combat racing game on a budget, and it shows in the lukewarm delivery of the single-player and multiplayer modes, and hand-me-down, controller-based UI.  That's not to say it doesn't have its merits; I'm not well-versed in Steam's car combat offerings, but I'll guess that there aren't many available at PAM's on-sale price point, so if you're itching for a vehicular action game and need a quick fix, this could be your thing.  And if you were already planning to play this with friends, I could see you easily getting your money's worth with the multiplayer, provided you didn't expect to have any fun with it when your friends aren't available.

												Though the controls do feel a little clunky at first, this is a very enjoyable ""Mario Kart"" clone, if you will. The combat while racing can be quite hilarious with friends, as well as competitive. The flaw in this game however, is the scoring system, in which you receive points based on laps and kills. Because of this, it is pointless to do more than a certain amount of laps on maps where you know you won't be able to do another one before time runs out. So, you are forced to sandbag for the rest of the time and stack up some kills.			",176,32,8,18,16,3,29

												Perhaps 4 months after initial release is too soon to say this, but there aren't that many maps (only 4 so far with the DLC), and perhaps I'm just doing it wrong but some of the weapons feel ineffective. Also the AI drives as alow as a bunch of old women.But with it's shortcomings aside (which will be patched in due time) It's still quite fun to play.Word of warning: This seems like a game that assumes that everybody uses a 360 controller, since it's made for the 360's ABXY button layout, and is color coded to match too.

												What would happen if Mario Kart got crossbreeded with a demolishion derby?! THEN-, you would uh, probably get the already existing game Jak X... ...BUT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PS2 AT THE MOMENT, YOU WOULD GET THE POST APOCALYPTIC MAYHEM!!Ahem, PAM is an intense racing warfare game where you do not compete for the first place. You compete for the most kills through an arsenal of wacky weapons, all depending on your chosen vehicle (who all have some kind of inspiration or theme).+ The selection of vehicles and their weapons who each demands specific tactics and strategies where not one is like another.+ I highly recommend playing PAM with a controller, when all your attacks are based on the 360 Controller's right buttonpad (Y,B,A,X) with A as your nitro, B, as your rear weapon, X as your sideweapons and Y for frontal mowing. So natural!+ The immersive tracks and stages is very fluid and are quick to learn the ups and downs in. One of them is just a lying eight, how rad is that?! - Sometime when you hit a obstacle or get thrown in high speed, your car turns into a helium filled balloon and flies all over the place which VERY QUICKLY can get on your nerves. The game prays that you get over it and keeps playing though.- Griefers could hide out at choke points just to have unsuspecting racers drive right into his just placed minefield or something like that. FRUSTRATION INDUCED.PAM has its rad parts and its bad parts but overall, I'm having a fun time with this controlled demolishion racer. I give it 7 / 10			",137,4,0,4,6,0,4
