												A rather enjoyable game that I can't recommend for one major reason: it's dead. There's just about no one online leaving you with nothing to do. Since it's online only that means it would be rather pointless purchasing this game unless if there's a sudden boom in the amount of players for some reason.If more people decided to play this game I'd recommend it, but in its current state I can't.

												This game is dead... Not only will you NEVER find a match, but there hasn't even been news about the game since 2010...So with that in mind... what is there to do?...This is a multiplayer only game... and bots only exist in ONE gamemode... on ONE map...That's it... unless you can get a bunch of people together in a lan party or something... that one gamemode, with one map, with one life as well, is literally all you can do... other than sight-see the areas with you never see populated...(I also read about some horror stories... mass spawn camping and some other problems with their systems... so keep that in mind if you DO manage to get a bunch of people to play it...)There is also the horribly buggy AI... Abysmal screen tearing when at high frames... clunky controls, bad animations, sub-par visuals...Bottom-Line... it is a mediocre game... that is also completely and utterly dead...

												I enjoyed this game shortly after it was launched, a few years ago. Unfortunately, the community was so non-existent that three games (two of them so laggy that all of us were dropped from the game, eventually) was all I had the chance to experience. The playerbase has gone nowhere, since then. Even despite despite attempts to dump it out on massive steam sales to unsuspecting players who don't know just how dead it is (an average of 5-10 players in July of 2014).

Unfortunitely it's developement staff didn't want to push to advertise it. For that, I will tell you right now, It is worth buying on a steam sale WITH FRIENDS. if you are thinking of buying this game for youself, don't waste your time it's been dead for alot of years. But if a few of your friends wont to get on and play rounds with eachother this game is pretty fantastic and worth your time. ",274,6,2,28,5,1,31

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Lead and Gold is a small not well known game created to be multiplayer based and the scene of mass carnage is in the old West, where Cowboys sling their guns and Deputies didn't care for the people and joined in the fun. This game is purely based on multiplayer with team objectives and just plain old gun shooting to kill the opponent and grab the lootOverall: Lead and Gold: Gangs of the Wild West isn't a Battlefield Bad Company 2 multiplayer and it has it's lag issues. However, you can still find a fast paced, enjoyable multiplayer experience in this game. Plus with the objectives and the pure joy of shooting down your enemy and the achievements you can unlock, chances are you will spend many months combing the old west with your old friend, the Negotiator.

												I've loved this game for many years now and have logged near countless hours but I feel this negitive review is nesscary. The developers have been contated about known exploits and hacking and have blatenly refused to do anything about it. As not only a server owner but an avid fan of the game this upsets me to no end. Not only do I not reccomend purchasing this game I recomend staying far away from all FatShark games. Why waste your time falling in love with a game that will only be tossed to the wayside.

												As of patch version 2.0 that came out several months ago, this game is completely broken and dead. Every dedicated server you try to connect to gives you the ""FAILED TO CONNECT TO SERVER"" message (you can start a local server, but it'll be insanely laggy) and the developers won't even acknowledge the existance of this game now that their new game (WOTR) is out. Even though I had hundreds of hours of fun in this game when it worked, it does not excuse the developers from breaking their game and jumping on their next cash cow without so much as even an attempt to fix this. Avoid this game like the plague, regardless of how cheap you see it on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Empty servers most of the time, 10 players at peak time!... and they won't always welcome you (spawn kill, etc.). It's really a pity because the game itself is very enjoyable.			",156,69,1,16,6,1,17

												Great fun and has a very long replay value. It's one of the most funnest games I've played in years.Sadly, the developers have stopped support wich lead to a very player base wich has to supply itself with servers to play on and a handful of hackers wich occasionally step in and annoy people with cheats, wich hasn't stopped me from playing though..If you're up for a cheap and (very) good 3rd person shooter, this is most definitly worth a try.There are full servers up daily (10 people), you just have to put up with cheaters now and then.

												This is probably one of the most fun multiplayer experiences I have ever encountered. It is similair to TF2...but with good gunplay. You have 4 classes and different objectives. The graphics still look really nice but the most important thing is gameplay/gunplay and Lead and Gold really feels refreshing and extremely fun. I can highly recommend it...BUT - this games playerbase is extremely small and people call the game dead, but I still managed to find games (Novemeber '15).			",787,255,33,85,79,10,118

 Lead and Gold: Gangs of the Wild West  This is a very fun multiplayer game in the climate of the wild west where we play four classes of characters like the hunter who uses a sniper rifle, a miner who uses guns, gunslinger who can quickly shoot at a close distance and the shooter who uses a rifle. The game features several maps, several game modes and co-op mode in which our task is to eliminate opponents and survive. The game is done very nicely, animation and soundtrack is also cool. I highly recommend this production is not too expensive and the servers still work and you can easily play it. ",442,96,20,45,31,7,33

												Lead and Gold has the ground work and potential to be a game that people never forget about, but until the developers implement that characteristic that keeps players motivated, the interest will always be minimal.

												My friends always try to get me into Team Fortress 2, but there's a slight problem: they're all mad good and I'm hella stupid at first-person shooters. So when Lead and Gold: Gangs of the Wild West came out, I was excited to switch over to that and be on a more level playing field. It's a fun game (that I don't suck at), but I don't think I'll be able to convince my friends to switch over for more than a couple days.  Lead and Gold is a third-person shooter set in the gold rush era (that's the mid 1800s, kids). You play as one of four different gun-wielding badasses out to get rich and mow down anyone else in their way. The characters are pretty standard in terms of gameplay. There's the pistol-packing cowboy, the sniper rifle hunter chick, the shotgun-miner, and the all around rifle wielding lawman. I love the Old West aesthetic of Lead and Gold. The characters ooze style. The Deputy wears garters and a bowler hat, so I'm pretty much in love with him. And the Trapper is Davy Crockett, reincarnated as a sexy chick. Of course, style doesn't mean the game looks great, because it doesn't. It looks OK, especially for a downloadable title, but it's not pretty. The game looks and feels a lot like Team Fortress 2, with a bit of Counterstrike mixed in. Each character has his or her own special moves as well as these inherent abilities called Synergies. The characters radiate a positive effect to nearby teammates, rewarding teams for sticking together and acting like a team. As players rank up (by earning EXP through killing enemies and whatnot), the Synergies get stronger. The six different game modes mostly focus around getting or defending large sacks of gold. There are Capture the Flag type events, mad dash ""grab it all"" events, and even more classic deathmatch style modes. All of this takes place in small old west towns, mine shafts, rural farmer homes, etcI like the team dynamic of the game. Teammates can revive you if you get shot down, provided your opponent doesn't come up and blow your face off while you're down (of course you can keep shooting at him too). And the ammo is unlimited, so you never have to stop playing to run around and look for that elusive shotgun ammo spot. As far as which version to get, it's really a tossup. There are more people playing on the PC servers, but that's probably because the game has been out for a while on Steam. I saw no major differences between the PC and console versions.Well, I don&#Array;t think Lead and Gold is going to replace Team Fortress 2 for any of the fans out there. There&#Array;s just not a lot in the game, but what is there is fun, stylish, and cool. If you&#Array;re more of a casual multiplayer gamer like I am, then Lead and Gold is neat game. Just don&#Array;t expect to be playing it for months on end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The art is great, the concept is great, but!There are multiple issues regarding hitboxes.There are only 10 active players.5 of the hack.I don't recommend buying this game, the absurd amount of hackers ruins any point in playing, and you can't even join another server, since there aren't enough players for that, and if to many players switch servers, the hacker will just follow you anyways.Everything about the game is awesome.except for the hackers.

												Is it worth your money? Short answer: NO.Long Answer: I bought this game shortly after it's release, and it was very fun and it was a different concept of 3 person shooter PvP. It became annoying when i realized that the Bots were incredibly stupid and glitchy and also the multiplayer was so bugged and laggy.Game servers were SO F**KING BAD. They crashed all the time and it would take so much freaking time to get into a good game. Even if you found a good server, it would take either several attempts to join or it would never connect, and finally, the worst part: THE LAG... OH MY GOD THE DAMN LAG... it was sooooo awful. They promised they will fix it, never did.This game was killed due to the fact that it was glitchy and poorly developed. Developers NEVER released any kind of update to this game or at least fixing the awful and laggy game server. This HAD great potential and they ruined it by not listening to the players.

That's why i've hardly played it, because there is no way to without multiplayer. And no-ones even there, so what's the point?The game is a really good one though! It is a third-person western shooter game, which I adore. I love western games, and third person shooters on these kind of game just 'fits' it. It's got plenty of modes and they are well thought out as well.This game is good, but it's time has passed.7/10[/b] ",84,5,0,5,8,3,11

												Hello?!? the game ain`t dead. There is still a amont of 10-15 players playing constantly. The game is a masterpiece of western shooters. It has a awesome graphic (year 2010-but still amazing). But the game is ""dead"" because there are lots of noobs who don`t even know to aim with mouse 1 or run with shift, so they quit instantly. PPL, FIRST GO TO PRACTICE/training  session in all games u buy. the second bag part is the price of 10 Euros... it is quite expensive in my opinion... I had lots of friends who wanna play, but when they see the price, they begin crying. Furthermore this game needs a new comunity, and the ppl who have and like it to come back. :D :D is a really great game.			",8,0,0,0,2,0,0

												I'll never understand why nobody plays this game, because it's one of the most solid third-person multiplayer shooters I've ever played. The controls are tight and responsive, the over-the-shoulder camera (which sucks in most games) works well, the visuals and music are both appealing, the map design is tons of fun, and the game modes consist of time-tested classics and a few things that have rarely been done. If this game can be faulted for anything, it's the lack of classes to play as and the dead multiplayer. You're lucky if you can find a handful of people to play with on a Friday night.

												Loved playing this game! one of my favorites back in the day. its a shame no one jumps on anymore maybe the lack of updates? Hopefully one day Fatshark will release the next big Lead and Gold!Overall this game is defiantly worth the $9.99 but due to it being a multiplayer game its useless now ;/ i wouldnt purchase the game now as the other reviews stated its now a graveyard on all servers...... if only it was populated again!

												Lead and Gold, is a third person multiplayer shooter taking place in the mid 1800s, in which two teams (red and blue) battle out each other across various gamemodes, or you can play co-op with another buddy and fight off waves of enemies. Note: I haven`t played all the objectives at the time being, due to the lack of players, I may edit this if I ever get a chance to play more objectives.So lets get to it:What I like:- Graphics arent too bad for a 2010 game.- It is fun, especially for a casual gamer.- 4 types of ""classes"" or characters that have they`re own advantages (we have the blaster, who basically has a shotgun, we have the gunslinger who is also for close range but has a high rate of fire with his pistol, we have the Trapper who is basically a sniper and also has a pistol, and lastly the deputy who has a rifle which can shoot medium-long range.)- Teamplay is promoted, health regen is faster when you are with your teammates, as well as the revive mechanic- Sound isnt that bad, although would prefer if characters said something to give them more presonality.- Movement is crsip and good and responsive.What I dont like:- First and formost, the lack of players is really noteable in this game, which is shocking, given the fact that the developer gave away over 300,000 keys for this game. (there are literally 2-4 servers at a time, thats it)- Gamemodes arent really original (Shootout which is basically team deathmatch, conquest, gold fever which is basically co-op for 2 players, greed where the objective is to get as much as gold sacks to the team`s drop zone, robbery where the attacking team has to destory the bank vault and get 3 gold sacks back to their dropzone, powderkeg where one team defends and the other destroys the objectives with powderkeg).- Lots of lag due to the lack of players.- Also, there is zero motive to keep playing this game, what I mean is that there is no real progression (or leveling up) system in the game nor there is any character customization, and there arent any real stats of you, unless if you go to dig your stats in the leaderboard.- 5v5, I want there to be more players, 5v5 is alittle less, but then again given the small playerbase, it doesnt even matter.- It would also be better if there were more maps and maybe more gamemodes as well.- Boring menu screen.- UPDATE: After playing the other gamemodes, I have to say they all just feel more or less the same.LASTING APPEAL: THIS GAME HAS GOOD VISUALS AND GOOD MOVEMENT AND IS REALLY FUN TO PLAY AS A CASUAL THIRD PERSON SHOOTER WITH THE 4 CLASSES, BUT THIS GAME IS KILLED TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS A LACK OF PLAYERS, LACK OF ANY PROGRESSION SYSTEM AND LACK OF CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION AND IN THE END NOT GIVING THE PLAYER A REAL REASON TO KEEP PLAYING THE GAME. I WILL RECOMMEND THIS GAME, AS I HAVE RECIEVED IT FOR FREE, BUT AT THIS STATE I CANNOT RECOMMEND FOR PURCHASE.8/10 - FREE5/10 - FULL PRICE			",171,36,8,18,9,3,15

												The content itself seems to be TF2 meets the wild, wild west. From that perspective, I liked the game. The community base, however, is absolutely toxic. As a new player, just over 50% of the player base will want to kick you for being a bad player even though you're still learning the ropes resulting in a temporary ban from the server. Given that there's only two of them, that makes it a little hard to learn the game and improve. And then I see people complaining that the player base is shrinking . . . You can't fix stupid.

												Quite the fun multiplayer shooter, but has some problems with cheaters and there aren't many players. Somewhat recommended.The game features 4 classes with distinctly different capabilities, but it's also well balanced enough that all 4 perform well and get picked fairly evenly. So even though the game's no longer in development, it's still fun to play because nothing is overpowered. Unfortunately, there's the occasional cheater. And even 1 is enough to ruin a game. Usually it's someone who's playing the one class that has an indirect weapon, and throwing that weapon very accurately at people they don't have in their line of sight. Or ambushing them with suspicious frequency. I'd wager there's a working wallhack for the game out there in the cheatosphere.Still, when there are a few players and nobody's cheating, it's one of the most fun shooters I've played.Especially noteworthy are the classes. They're all fun to play. Two of them are a short-range shotgunner and a long-range sniper, whuch have to, respectively, rush in or stay at a distance to be effective. The other two are the short-mid range revolver guy and the mid-long range rifle guy. The reason they all work is that pretty much all the maps are varied enough to allow it. There are usually some open areas that allow sniping, plenty of buildings for short range skirmishes and plenty of cover all around. And the characters move fast and rarely die from a single shot. So firefights are exciting and full of movement and usually last a few seconds.One of the unique things about the game is that when you run out of health, you get knocked to the ground instead of dying immediately. You stay knocked down until an enemy finishes you off, you choose to respawn, or a teammate revives you. And a couple of seconds after being knocked down, you become able to shoot slowly and inaccurately with your sidearm. Still, most of the time you'll just end up getting finished off almost as soon as you're knocked down.When you do die, you can respawn either in the base or on the spawn flag, which any player can pick up from the base and carry around until they get killed. When the flag is dropped, players can still spawn on it, and teammates can pick it up. If an enemy picks it up, it's teleported back to base. This is a cool way to let players jump right into the action.And it also tends to keep most of the team close together, which is great because of 2 other features - synergies and healing. Synergies are bonuses that every class gives to every teammate in range, but they don't stack. So to get full bonuses, you need 1 each of the 4 different classes reasonably close together. And you also get a slow passive healing effect if near teammates.This passive encouragement of team play is great for the game's CTF-style modes. Except it's actually Capture The Gold, and when you're carrying the sack of gold you're super slow, unable to jump, unable to shoot, and can be seen by enemies across the map. So you need your teammates to cover you. The same goes for modes that require carrying a barrel of gunpowder, with the added danger of the barrel exploding after a couple seconds if it gets hit by a bullet.Other game modes are the typical team deathmatch and capture-the-point.Maps are generally good, and some feature oldtimey machineguns in fixed positions, which are fun to use. Although one of the maps has a machinegun in a rather overpowered position near the center.The maps generally prevent enemies from getting into the spawn area, but a lot of the time the fighting will be around one of the spawns, with the attackers throwing dynamite into the spawn. Usually though, the defenders can hold their own, unless there's one of the aforementioned cheaters among the attackers.Gameplay aside, the game has a nice atmosphere. The visuals, character designs, maps, sound effects and music are all consistent with the semi-comical Western feel the game is going for.Finally, at the time of writing, the game is somewhat short on players. It's rarely possible to play outside of evenings in European timezones, and even then there's rarely more than one game going and often none at all, with some players joining if I host. Since this is a multiplayer-only game, a further dwindling of players will make it worthless. But, fears of a multiplayer game running out of players are often a self-fulfilling prophecy, so don't let this stop you. It's a good game, worth your time.			",397,123,22,43,90,3,117

												NOSTALGIA WARNING!One of the best online multiplayer games ive played nostalgia included.I picked up this game right around the time it was released and I instantly fell in love with it and I can't tell you how much fun I had with this game. I can't really explain what it was with this game that just blew me away, it had great controls was fast paced though you could slow the pace at times had an awesome western atmosphere and just pulled you in like no multiplayer game that I can quote today.Lead and gold was just this thing that touched my life in a way. I think it was the first game that I ever made an entire group of steam friends in.  I swear I lived lead and gold in the few years that it was at it's peak. If I could relate my experience in any way I'd say it was like the first time you played ""The oregon trail"" in school with your classmates.All this being said this is a review and no matter how I love this game I must say this game is dead... Now don't go away just yet! I know this game is for all definitive purposes ""dead"" but I want to give insight to why and to tell you that the game isn't plauged by the problems that I believe killed it in the first place. The reason lead and gold is a proverbial ghost town was because of it's matchmaking and the fact that it was overlooked by it's target audience I feel like it could be revived and yes I may be saying this straight from my nostalgia Gland but I do. So please don't simply overlook this game I'd ask that you do some research look at gameplay videos see if it's something that interests you and then maybe put it on your wishlist until you hear that it's come roaring back if it ever does.PROS: 1. FUN!2.Tight controls3.Great old western atmosphere4.Several gamemodes to choose from5.BONUS FUN!CONS:1.Low to No Players playing on servers (Dead Servers)2.Slim variety of game mapsIn ending I hope people start playing this great game again. And if anyone does make sure to invite me to your shootout.			",216,17,0,14,3,2,4

												Not too shabby. Lead and Gold's an addictive multiplayer focused third person shooter that is very immediate, visually impressive, besides being remarkably cheap. I like that the class balancing is spot on for the most part, being fairly flexible moving between play styles aswell, unlike Monday Night Combat in contrast. Lead and Gold's trump card is solid tactical play and teamwork, game modes rotate largely between Attack and Defend playsets which are not to be played in a straightforward manner like in any other multiplayer game. Yet on the downside, Lead and Gold is overshadowed by a poor lobby system and community. Inviting friends into a match, any match, is hard work and there is no clear way of balancing or switching teams without calling for a democratic vote in scrambling teams. Not many players on Lead and Gold will admittedly play fair either, with spawn camping and noob hunting being common sport in matches. Keep this in mind if you consider buying the game.

												This is a great game to play for anyone into western shootouts. Its set in 3rd person. The sounds in the game are great and really make you feel like your in a shootout. There are different characters in the game to play with and each one has its perks and traits to play with and use to your advantage. The graphics are really fun and creative to look at. The downfall to this game is that it can sometimes get really hard to play online with people so there is a small learning curve to get good at this game. It has been really enjoyable to play the different multiplayer gameplays. Its a great western shootout game. Get it when you can see it go on sale. ",3034,1132,139,314,429,33,476

												Picked this game up back in 2010. It looked like an interesting multiplayer game, but I never got to really test that out because it was dead. There have been a few attempts to revive the game's playerbase but after the sales, it's barren again. I wouldn't recommend picking this game up unless it's on a steep discount that's worth the few days of play you'll be able to get.			",133,39,1,19,8,2,38

												I recieved this game for free yes. The developers gave a way a ton of codes. I was able to snag one. Now let me tell you, this is one of those games that you should actually check out. I have way to many games I got for free that I never downloaded that just sit in my games list. This is one you should check out. It is a very smooth gameplay. Character control can get a little buggy sometimes. But shooting is smooth, the game runs smooth. Imagine Red Dead Redemption MP remade with more of a cartoony graphics look. I would have to say..

												This feels like a really good game. Its gameplay is simple, yet addictive and satisfying. The graphics are great, even for how old it is now! The only issue is the lack of players. There's generally around 10 players max, online at any time. Most of the time that number is 0. I believe, like many others, the game should go free-to-play and be updated with content. The developers gave out 100k Steam keys and it did bring some life back into the game (but sadly, that was short-lived.) The game most likely died due to lack of content. Despite a decent set of maps/gamemodes, there's nothing else. There's no bots (except for a simple tutorial/co-op map that's basically just survival mode). The game, being a 3rd person shooter, would highly benefit off a decent selection of cosmetics. Also, new guns/customizable loadouts would be a plus. There's no reason to play other than for pure entertainment. Although this isn't a problem for some, others enjoy collecting items, progressing, etc.. Hopefully this game is revived someday; it has A LOT of potential!			",279,17,23,21,11,2,7

												This game is dead. Actually it was dead when I purchased it a few years back. I never had a chance to actually play this game. It is sad because this game looks something that I could enjoy. The graphics, the mechanics are good, but without players and computer controlled enemies this one cannot be played.Currently I cannot recommend this game for purchase. The best thing that can happen to this game is to become free, that may help it gaining player base once again.With less than half an hour of gameplay I am not giving a score to this one.

												The game seemed good and was apparently really fun to play. However I have only been able to play it two or three times because NO ONE plays it. You have to be lucky to find 1 server with some people. Also, everyone plays the same class. It needs balancing, updating and fixing (I have an issua and can't find the solution anywhere) but unfortunately, the devs have apparently abandoned it.NOT WORTH IT unless you get it with friends and, unlike me, have no GFX issues.

												This is a scam. Do not fall for it. This is not a video game. It is a DEMO that lets you play the tutorial and nothing else. There are absolutely no available servers. The one server I found that had a few players would not even let me join. When you click on it, it loads for a couple of seconds and then it just tells you ""Failed to connect to server"". This keeps happening over and over again. Do not fall for this scam. I repeat, this is not a video game!			",61,8,0,3,2,0,4

												Pros:-Easy to learn interface and gameplay-Balanced gameplay- Very simple game, making it easy for even the biggest noob to blend in-A nice Co-op feel to itCons:-Not enough game types/maps-Deserted game, not enough players and too many quit early-Simplicity leaves much to the imaginationOverall:Lead & Gold is one of my favorite shooters so far, even though I've only played so little I've basiclly mastered the game, and usually max out all the scoreboards and win the game for my team. All I kept hearing for this game were complaints for things that honestly, don't really even need to be in the game, there's no customizing whatsoever and boy did I hear my fair share about it.I'd give it an 7.5/10Good for short bursts, I'd go longer if I had some friends who played it			",189,21,1,37,13,1,34

												A pick up and play game, Lead and Gold has some good points going for it: very skill-based, team-supportive, and a decent variety of maps and graphics. It's a fun game, when it's not utterly chaotic. You can spawn on top of a flag that teammates carry around the map, which is both an interesting mechanic, and very frustrating, when enemies pop up in your face with a shotgun in the middle of you focusing on something else. Explosions, one-hit kills, and anyone able to pop up anywhere (there are no choke points in any map) can make for a very random, hectic, and skill-less battle at times.But if you can put up with it's unforgiving, crazy nature, it's rewarding. Unfortunately there are just a lot of games that do this style way better. The most unique thing it has going for it is the Wild West. 4/10			",257,74,5,20,26,3,26

												Unbalanced, laggy and just simply bad game.When I saw the trailer for this game I was real excited. I bought this game when this was brand new and actually enjoyed it. Then I unfortunately couldn't access the game anymore (it was on my friends account which I shared with him) and just forgot about this game. When I came back in 2014 the game was just bad.Hackers, griefers and extremely low amount of players. Only 1-3 servers to play in which have the ping around 100-200. The ping is manageable and doesn't bother that much but when it comes to griefing, well, that's nightmarish. Maps are unbalanced and let you pretty much grief in any map and in any spot.I could actually recommend if they would update this game and maybe do it free to play. It would increase the amount of players with an insane amount.			",383,57,14,26,17,4,19

												This game is basically what Fistful of Frags should have been. The guns feel good (unlike Frags...), classes are varried, and the game types are fun. The gamemodes are a bit like Battlefield's minus the giant maps and vehicles. It's a sad thing that it was dead on arrival and didn't get a chance to shine. For this game to survive it needs to 1) go f2p and 2) get a progression system of some sort. If it does that I think the game really has a chance of comming back from the dead.

												Well... This game is fantastic. It completely gives the feeling of the western-shooter world. Graphics and the gameplay are really good. Unfortunately, there are very few players join to play (the avarage is 8-12). I'm really disappointed about the fact that this  outstanding game isn't played by many players. Thus you can only play if you have luck to see some of them. I gave a positive, but I don't recommend buying it unless it's resurrected somehow.Hát... Hihetetlenül jó játák, hangulatos, pont olyan amilyennek egy ilyen vadnyugatos játéknak lennie kell. Grafika, kezelhetőség mind rendben van.Azonban nem nagyon játsza senki. :( Sajnos így nem tudom ajánlani, mert szerencse kell ahhoz, hogy kifogj egy két játékost (átlag 8-12 van az egész játékban).

The game lacks any video options what so eve. For example no option for vysnc ( without having to close the game and go to the nvidia control panel and forcing a vsync option). The game was mostly meh for me I have had a very hard time playing it for very long because of the lack of fresh ideas. The only game mode I was able to play was mostly very short and ended very quickly. I would not recomend this game to anyone			",71,17,3,0,5,0,1

												I found this game honestly to be vairy poorly made and not very fun at. I have palyed many games much better then this at the price of free to play. The game lacks any video options what so eve. For example no option for vysnc ( without having to close the game and go to the nvidia control panel and forcing a vsync option). The game was mostly meh for me I have had a very hard time playing it for very long because of the lack of fresh ideas. The only game mode I was able to play was mostly very short and ended very quickly. I would not recomend this game to anyone			",71,17,3,0,5,0,1

												This is pretty much a niche game trying to fill the hole of western third person shooters. It does that job rather well at first. However the game is rather superficial and doesn't bring out much more with time, thus quickly becoming boring.If you're looking for something western I'm not really sure if there are better options, but this is also a risky buy since it relies on online servers and players. If you're looking for new shooters then I don't really think it's very wise to spend money on this.			",280,91,1,30,12,1,27

												This game is very entertaining. It makes you feel as though you are playing Team Fortress 2, but in the wild west. It has a similar class based system, and each class has it's own special ability. Depending on your play style, you may excel at only a couple of them, or all if you practice with them enough.Although this game is fun, it lacks replayability in my opinion because there haven't been any new map additions in a while. With this in mind, it feels as though the game developers are not actively updating the game. Similarly, there haven't been any new game modes added in a while. Also, most importantly, it doesn't have voice support.Despite these minor problems, the game is very fun to play with friends and others alike. I recommend getting this game, but only when it is on sale.			",146,10,2,12,4,3,5

												While the game was on it's prime, it was really fun to mess around. Now it seems to be broken abondonware which is given away in 100 000 copies, yet keeping the retail price at 10EUR which is pure nonesense.I'd recommend it if it would get fixed and patched up. Now it's just like trying to ride a dead and maimed horse.			",259,59,11,21,32,3,38

												This game seems like it would be really fun, but it's entirely reliant on other players. No one plays this game anymore so you're basically paying for an unplayable game. There is a practice mode but it's not challenging at all.			",68,6,1,4,13,0,5

												While the game seems to be good technically, mechanically, and graphically, it doesn't matter. At the time of this writing, there are between three and eight players online simultaneously, with only four servers available. To make this multiplayer focused game even more worthless, the ping from the one populated server is 200+. It's a shame to see a third person, multiplayer action game with such a fun theme go to waste, but that is in fact what happened. I'm not sure who is to be blamed, but knowing that Fatshark developed it and Paradox Interactive published it explains a lot.Lead and Gold: Gangs of the Wild West is bad.

												While cheep I don't recommend the game. Lead and Gold is basically a TF2 clone just without class balance. Very neat concepts with the synergies, reviving, mobile spawn point and objective based game play but the tutorial summed up the game best. After some simple text explanations 4 bots spawn in and bum rushed the spawn point, this in turn allowed them to continuously and repetitively killing me over and over again until I just put my hands up after I'd had enough of it- this is not good game play. In multiplayer if you're on the winning side it's sadistically fun to pin the enemy in their spawn and just pick them off (of course) while they try desperately to gain a foothold. But on the losing team its just a lesson in frustration and either way it's not a fun experience.1/5			",153,27,0,21,20,2,15

												This is one of those western shooters so you're a cowboy and you fight other cowboys and try to get the gold but it turns out that the heavy is a spy and then you get shot by a sniper. Also when you get shot your hat falls off so this is basically the opposite of team fortress.			",565,260,11,121,74,5,145

												""The gold-seekers, called ""Forty-niners"" (as a reference to 1849, which is the year President James Polk declared a gold rush), often faced substantial hardships on the trip. While most of the newly arrived were Americans, the Gold Rush attracted tens of thousands from Latin America, Europe, Australia, and eventually China. At first, the prospectors retrieved the gold from streams and riverbeds using simple techniques, such as panning. More sophisticated methods of gold recovery were developed and later adopted around the world. At its peak, technological advances reached a point where significant financing was required, increasing the proportion of gold companies to individual miners. Gold worth tens of billions of today's dollars was recovered, which led to great wealth for a few. However, many returned home with little more than they had started with."" this is 49er fever in effect... thievin and murderin for gold in them thar hills!!!			",1082,313,31,107,88,14,131

												Lead and Gold had potential but the idiocy of the developers ultimately killed the game. The glaringly obvious flaw of Lead and Gold is the complete lack of campaign or competent bots to play against. The game itself is highly dependent on an active community since it’s a multiplayer only game. In the rare event Lead and Gold gets a temporary player base boost due to sales, the game quickly loses play value. The maps are extremely imbalanced with “op” spots that can quickly rage quit the uninformed. Lead and gold tries very hard but it’s a far cry from the genius that is Team Fortress 2.

The game is for the most part balanced and focuses on alot of teamwork, but one good player can carry a team sometimes. The graphics are good and nothing to complain much about. You also watch your screen twist and turn as you run, jump and barrel roll your way through the map with the PhysiX. A really good $1.50.			",272,25,4,25,16,0,34

			This video shows how laggy are the controls in ""Lead and Gold"" game. The game menu is basically lag-less (probably because of high FPS).

												I have been put off by the console-game look of this title but recently gave it a shot with the free weekend and price reduction. Even with in-game practice my first online game was rough to say the least. Capture points and stealing bags of gold are the primary gamemodes. Gameplay is centered on your teams' flag which can be picked up by anyone allowing dead players to respawn back at the start or on their flagholder. Dying means the flag drops and remains til either the opposing team touches it sending it back or your team picks it up and carries it onward. The gunplay is very fast and in your face with the exception of the Trapper or patient Deputy. You can run and tumble off 2nd floors not missing a beat which makes for interesting uses for the landscape when the gunplay gets heavy. Very happy I picked this one up and spent a few hours with it. The maps are well done and not too big to the point where you feel out of the action. Skin yer smokewagons and see what happens!			",307,43,6,38,54,2,62

That's why i've hardly played it, because there is no way to without multiplayer. And no-ones even there, so what's the point?The game is a really good one though! It is a third-person western shooter game, which I adore. I love western games, and third person shooters on these kind of game just 'fits' it. It's got plenty of modes and they are well thought out as well.If anybody has this game and wants multiplayer, please add me so we can play!			",31,2,0,1,3,0,0

												Development and support from the publisher was pulled ages ago. No one plays anymore and this is a multiplayer-only title. No players in a multiplayer only game = dead game. I think they only keep the server browser working so they can continue to sell the title to the gullible. A dead multiplayer only game is unplayable. It shouldn't even be sold at this point. It's completely dishonest and if Fatshark/Paradox won't pull the plug, I think that Valve should.This is really sad because this game was actually pretty good and unique when it was released. It did a lot of things right. There were balance issues of course but the gameplay was fun despite that. However, over time, the balance issues didn't get fixed, no new content was added, the game grew stale and people left for greener pastures.PS - This is now the THIRD game that Fatshark/Paradox has done this to. First Lead & Gold. then War of the Roses and the god-awful War of the Vikings. They pump multiplayer-only games and then leave them to wither on the vine once the money dries up. Be wary about buying anything from them as they have a now well-established history of just abandoning their games instead of trying to make them have any kind of lasting appeal			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, what is there to say about this game?To be honest it's a great game. It's biggest setback is that it is (please keep reading) dead. However at the moment there a few players who are trying to get this game back on its feet. Even if it's just a small group of 6-10 dedicated players I think it'll be a good start to get this game going again.For the moment I will recommend this game in hopes of getting more players but if this attempt fails then I will change my review to not recommended.

												A very nice western team-based shooter. Great graphics and gameplay. Quite a few game modes. four characters to choose from, each with their own unique abilities and arsenal. Hopefully they'll add a Survival mode in the next patch. WARNING: Unfortunately, the player base is now pretty small and they released the dedicated server way too late.UPDATE: It is dead, and they never released the patch they promised eons ago.

												The initials of Lead And Gold spell LAG, and lag is pretty much all you can get with this game. See my video:


YouTube™ Video: Lead and Gold: Laggy controls 

			Views: 304		

			This video shows how laggy are the controls in ""Lead and Gold"" game. The game menu is basically lag-less (probably because of high FPS).

The gameplay is pretty solid and fun, it's easy to pick up and get into. The only real problem I have with the game is that there is no crouch, which in a shooter, is always helpful. Other than that, it looks nice and plays nice.			",302,56,11,90,28,3,55

In one of the game modes you collect gold. You'd have got pretty much none of that from the title. Just thought I'd let you all know, save you the effort of looking up Wikipedia.Pretty fun, well worth the money. Should last you a while with friends. Shooty shooty.			",559,150,13,61,32,6,71

If you like Cowboys, or hate them, this game is for you.Pros:Shooting hats off snipersShooting hats off *insert class*Shooting hats off your team matesQuick paced fighting keeps things interestingCons:Low Multiplayer populationCould use a freaking expansion or something to boost replay valueNot enough hats to shoot off people's heads.

												Aww geez. Not sure what to say here, but this game WAS really fun. The community died quickly, probably due to a lack of advertising or something. Anyways, if people still played I would give this a really positive review. Seriously, this game can be very fun if you have people to play with.Basically all the classes are unique and balance each other well. The maps are well designed; both visually interesting and reminescent of TFC/TF2. The art direct is great too, again very TF2-like. Look, if you can get a group of friends together to play this, it's well worth it. I'd recommend at least 10 people, though. Aside from it being dead, it really is fun. It's essentially a Wild West TF2, and had the developers made an actual attempt at marketing this game it probably would have a decent community. As it is, it's sad to see this game so lifeless.

												this is a game that should be on EVERYONE'S list, why? because its a good western version of TF2. its a lot less cartoony then tf2 but it does a LOT of really awesome things that make it stand out from other team based objective games. wanna rob a bank? see which team can take the most gold! want to set a trap and snipe them before they know whats coming? become the trapper! be the miner and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up! each class has its own special ability like tf2, like the gunslinger who can rapid fire, the trapper traps people ing bear traps, the miner has dynomite, and the black guy can see through walls and know where you are!

												A fun little team based shooter that never seemed to catch on, Lead and Gold did a lot of things right: diverse classes, passive buffs encouraging teamwork, good map variety, attractive visual design, and satisfying gunslinging firefights. However, its matchmaking always left a lot ot be desired, lag was a consistent problem, and on some maps and servers, there was serious imbalance between the classes, leading to everyone toting shotguns and chucking dynamite.Overall, it's a shame the player base has been gradually dying off since release, and I hesitate a recommendation if you are buying alone. If you have a few friends interested, I recommend picking up a 4-pack; it's a great deal, and you only need six to eight players for a really solid match.			",149,29,0,13,23,1,40

												Great game, but unfortunately can't find many folks online.  Reminds me of Shattered Horizon, another great game that unfortunately didn't garner the following it deserved.  But, when you do find a game unfortunately the player base is rather unfriendly, in my experience; you get into a game with 6 people, 3 of whom are veterans, and they refuse to scramble the teams and what not.  Not a great way to attract people to a floundering community.  But, if your lucky enough to get into a game with folks who just wanna run around shootin' and whoopin' it up like cowboys w/ out relying on idiosynchronous glitches your in for a rip roaring good time!

												I'll be honest, this is one of those games that looks too good to be true and it delivers. However, I'm not going to lie about how great the game. When I first bought the game last summer, it wasn't popular so it was hard finding a full server. The combat system is rather unique for each of the four classes, but abusable in some regards: faster than humanly possible shooting is the only thing that really breaks the game. I haven't tried this game in months, and I doubt I ever will since it's not cup of tea, but I certainly recommend it for Western fans. The developers may have turned the game around, fixed bugs, and balanced weapons and such so give it whirl, but I'd visit the forums first to check how active the player base is. I don't regret buying this, I just never found it interesting enough to keep playing.			",93,10,0,8,2,0,1

Hopefully they'll add a Survival mode in the next patch. WARNING: Unfortunately, the player base is now pretty small and they released the dedicated server way too late.UPDATE: It is dead, and they never released the patch they promised eons ago.

												Great game with poor follow up.  I love everthing about this game except for the low community population, scarce server list, and complete lack of character balancing and updating from its creators.  To my great dismay this appears to be another game that, while very fun despite its issues, failed to cultivate a respectable following, resulting in very few improvements since its release.  I DO recommend this game if they developers show some more love but do not if they abandon it, which seems to be the case at the time of this review.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun game!  really good gameplay and gamemodes, TheFattestShark has done well again!but i still have a mayor problem with the game: Servers.... every god damn server has either 90 or more ping wich is all good until it spikes to over 300, the problem is probably the private hosts but still it makes the game unplayable, since the quick match sends u into any server available which is not a lot and the private hosts dont do well, and u cant server browse very well. which makes it difficult finding a game and server that works well.

												The game WOULD be 9 out of 10 but it's been long abandoned by not only the playerbase but the devs too. I really enjoyed it when it still had people playing it. DON'T BUY IT.			",100,15,0,6,4,1,14

												Aww geez. Not sure what to say here, but this game WAS really fun. The community died quickly, probably due to a lack of advertising or something. Anyways, if people still played I would give this a really positive review. Seriously, this game can be very fun if you have people to play with.Basically all the classes are unique and balance each other well. The maps are well designed; both visually interesting and reminescent of TFC/TF2. The art direct is great too, again very TF2-like. Look, if you can get a group of friends together to play this, it's well worth it. I'd recommend at least 10 people, though. Aside from it being dead, it really is fun. It's essentially a Wild West TF2, and had the developers made an actual attempt at marketing this game it probably would have a decent community. As it is, it's sad to see this game so lifeless.

												Have you ever looked through your steam library and seen a game or two that you honestly can't remember buying or being gifted? This was that game for me. By the time I tried it out the multiplayer was already dead so I can't recommend it.			",106,9,0,17,5,0,5

												I love this game, and I want to bring it back. Right now, the servers are all pretty dead, but I think if enough people still like this game, we can make it big. If you own this game and want to play it, friend me and invite me to a match.			",90,2,0,10,3,0,1

												Development and support from the publisher was pulled ages ago. No one plays anymore and this is a multiplayer-only title. No players in a multiplayer only game = dead game. I think they only keep the server browser working so they can continue to sell the title to the gullible. A dead multiplayer only game is unplayable. It shouldn't even be sold at this point. It's completely dishonest and if Fatshark/Paradox won't pull the plug, I think that Valve should.This is really sad because this game was actually pretty good and unique when it was released. It did a lot of things right. There were balance issues of course but the gameplay was fun despite that. However, over time, the balance issues didn't get fixed, no new content was added, the game grew stale and people left for greener pastures.PS - This is now the THIRD game that Fatshark/Paradox has done this to. First Lead & Gold. then War of the Roses and the god-awful War of the Vikings. They pump multiplayer-only games and then leave them to wither on the vine once the money dries up. Be wary about buying anything from them as they have a now well-established history of just abandoning their games instead of trying to make them have any kind of lasting appeal			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
