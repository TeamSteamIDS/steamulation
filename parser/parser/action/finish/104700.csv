												Okay, so after finally pouring 100 hours into this game in such a small time, I've decided to actually write a review on this game now. This review is rather lengthly. Sorry for being boring.This is not a pay to win.First off, the description for this game is outdated. It is not updated weekly, and has been 'abandoned' by the developers. There has not been an update since early 2013. Uber Entertainment said multiple times on their forums that if they have a small chance to revive the game, they will. For now, they shall focus on bigger projects. Let's hope they keep that promise. Now to the review.After acquiring over 100 hours, I can say this game is PURE HELL to get into. The game has been 'dead' or rather, has a low playerbase, and has done for about 2 years now. There are the occasional new players, but they don't stick around after what they find.The BadSo, before you decide whether or not to play this game, or dive in blind and think 'Yeah! This'll be great and fun!' I'm going to post all the negatives so you don't have to experience them getting thrown at your face first hand.1. The CommunityAs I have previously stated, the playerbase for this game is rather at a low. Due to this factor, you'll find most players you run into will be fully geared to the teeth (completely cosmetics.. except for endorsements, but we'll get to that). Now, I'm not saying every experienced player in this game is a huge butt, but most of them are.You'll find people will find ways to get angry in almost any situation. Whether their team is winning or losing. They'll find ways to insult you, no matter how. Be it your interests, name, how you type/play. You name it.I'll probably go as far to say the community on this game is worse than Dota 2 or League of Legends. However, this doesn't mean you can find... ""nice"" players to run into. I can name a few, but I won't mention any names in this review to respect people's privacy.2. EndorsementsOkay, so. Endorsements! I'll give you a quick run down on what they are.In SMNC, you start off at level 0. Every 4 levels, you unlock a new Endorsement slot, getting up to 25 slots in total. You can go above the level 100 mark, but this will not unlock any endorsement slots.Now, Endorsements themselves are small buffs with a positive advantage, and a negative disadvantage. These can be bought with coins, and are permenant, so you can buy and keep as many as you like. Mixing and matching different Endorsements at level 100 can help in giving you a huge advantage against players.Now, here's the thing.As I have previously explained, playerbase is rather low. So you'll be finding if you're a new player straight off the bat, you'll be running into all these powerful and experienced pros... With all of their Endorsement slots filled.This feature alone is probably one of the single handed reasons along with the community that I hate this game.3. MatchmakingNow, this is what I feel to be one of the game's biggest flaws.As explained above, most of the community is experienced players. Now, if you get new players joining, or less experienced ones, this won't change anything. Matchmaking is COMPLETELY random. It won't pair you up against players based on their level/skill/endorsement sets, it'll just drag and drop you into a list and not care.This leads to cases such as having a completely new team, fight against a team of experienced players.. Utterly getting slaughtered in the process.4. Conclusion of Bad PointsAs you may have guessed just by reading this...This game is incredibly hard to get into. To the point of masochism. It's easy to get stressed out over the various negatives at this game.Now, you may be wondering... Why did I go through with it? Why did I continue to play, despite the horrible negatives?The GoodI can't deny it. This game is special. Something is so fun and quirky about it.1. The Atmosphere. I'll get this out of the way first.Simply put, this game has an amazing atmosphere. A futuristic combat sport set in an arena, crowd going wild, announcers with funny voice lines, fitting situations well. What's not to love?The Crowd is dynamic. Say if you were to make a kill, make something happen, or an event happens in the map, the crowd will respond. Being either cheers of joy, or jeers of disappoint.The Announcers are fun to listen to. They sometimes share interesting stories, talk about what is happening in the match, and will respond to any kills/killstreaks/annihilator use. It all feels so real, and well done. The voice acting is great in this game. That is undeniable.2. Gameplay itselfMost people end up mistaking this game for a third person shooter... and end up raging in the process.Though it may feel strange or possibly even unnatural at first, SMNC has a really great feel once you get the hang of it. A MOBA with Third Person Shooter hybrid elements? At the time, it was pretty new. Fresh, too. I'm not sure if there have been any since.Each pro has three abilities, all bound to SHIFT, Q and E by default. It's simple, really. Each pro is easy to understand, and there are many to choose from.. Although there are no longer 'free pro rotations'. I've had fun playing a lot of them though!All in all, I feel like this is one of those games where you have to 'play it yourself to understand' it.3. Conclusion of Good PointsI honestly don't think I really need much of a conclusion here, as most of it is explained above. I can give a bit of advice though.You can't learn if you don't play, so keep on trying! And play for fun. Ignore the occasional butthead you might come across who will call you a 'feeder' or a 'noob' or anything of the sort.And that concludes my Super Monday Night Combat Review! If you've read this far, I'm amazed. Thank you for reading, as I appreciate it. Sorry if I might've bored you though. Have fun playing! I hope ",273,23,3,28,14,3,21

												I wanted to enjoy SMNC back when it actually had people. I couldn't though for the same reasons that's driving new players away today.There are two reasons. The first being the complete lack of matchmaking via skill/experience. This should have been priority for an MOBA where extreme teamwork is important. Match the players who were new with the other players who were new and the more experienced against the more experienced! This should have just been common sense. Uber did not make this a priority and SMNC lost a lot of the players who would have been really interested in this game when it first came on steam.The other reason I stopped playing was because of the pile of dogshit this game calls a community and the fact that I hear it's gotten worse as the game dwindled down to a small one tells me that the absolute death of SMNC is imminent.You would think that the small veteran community nowadays would band together, grow up, and attempt to build the playerbase by ACTUALLY BEING PLEASENT TO PLAY WITH, but no. Let's all be a bunch of angry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and dig the hole a bit deeper with every single match until there is literally no one who wants to play this game.The terrible matchmaking early on wasn't enough to make me stop playing, but the horrible attitudes of the community along with it was enough to make me uninstall. So congrats there, veteran community. You keep driving away any chance of this game making a comeback because you can't stop being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to the new players (and eachother) who might have actually enjoyed this game all because you want to, ""win"".Well congrats! ""Your winner""! What's the prize? AN EMPTY GAME TO GO WITH YOUR INFERIORITY COMPLEX!+1 for getting the Big Rigs reference.			",113,9,0,26,3,0,12

												Don't let the lack of players stop you from playing this game. Yes it is true, the community is mostly dead and those who are still here are way better than you are. Play it anyway. I'll explain why, and then I will explain how.Why should you play SMNC even though it has no population and you will get spanked:The SuperCrossfire mode came out in spring of 2012 and there is still nothing like it. SuperCrossfire is intense, and will make you incredibly angry, but it is the most satisfying game I have ever player. Don't play SuperCrossfire, PLAY TURBOCROSS. When you see these reviews saying that they can't get into matches, or get into them infrequently, they are talking about SuperCrossfire which requires a full team before the match begins. In a perfect world, we could play that mode, but the world sucks so we have to play TurboCross. Even though TurboCross is watered down SuperCrossfire, it still has no equivalent. Believe me, if I could find a third-person shooter MOBA with jumping, dodging, grapples, and class-synergy, then I would be playing it instead (assuming that more people played it). Here is the low-down, Uber spent millions on this game and it shows. Unfortunately, they didn't make money from it so it has been abandoned. But again, there just isn't anything like it and what it does is amazing.The basic idea is that you and your team are supposed to help your bots advance in two lanes in order to take down the shields of enemy turrets and eventually take down the money-ball. There are two lanes, so even though you may be pushing one really hard, you have to worry about how the other is doing. All of the maps are symetrical. Now, a lot of players just don't understand how important it is to kill bots. Killing bots is the most effective method of winning the game. Of course the other team will try to kill you while you do it, and you don't want that to happen. Why don't you want that to happen? because while you are dead, you kill less bots. Kill bots, push your lane, take out their turrets once the shield is down, do the same to the money ball. If you see that the other lane is having the same done to it by the other team, switch lanes and push it back to atleast the middle. Oh I forgot to explain why this is fun. It's amazing. When you and 1-3 other teammates are pushing a lane together and you make progress even though the other team is trying to kill you, you feel like you are making something happen. This is a different feeling than coming in first in a race or having a high kill-to-death ratio. Pushing a lane is slow and must me sustained. When I die, I worry about how far back my lane is going to get pushed and whether or not we will be able to push it back to where it was. It's different than k/d, it just is. Other third-person shooters just don't offer this. How to play with a low population:Play a Pickup game of Turbocross on the North American server after 5pm EST preferably on the weekend. Yes, I know that this is limiting, but it's what you have to do to play this game that no one else has made yet and is ahead of its time. It will take maybe 10 minutes to find your first game, but after that you are in rhythm, so most of the players of your last game will show up for the next. You will see the same names on different days, there are not many of us. Be nice because you will see them again. They will not be nice to you, I am sorry. Stay near your team and kill-bots. Stay on one lane until you know the maps. Eventually you should ask someone what the annihilator is. Good luck. If people knew what this game was like, there would be a lot of people playing it, but it looks like Team Fortress 2 and when it don't play in a similar way, folks think it is a bad game. SMNC has major flaws, but there just isn't anything like it and what it does is valuable.			",143,74,5,21,21,4,30

												2 Years after this game being abandoned by the Devs, people still play it AND there's no game like SMNC, it's a one of a kind game that needs to be known more.The game can't really be dead, because there's people like myself who don't want to let this game go, it's a really special flower that won't ever die.Besides the low population, what else does this game offer, quite a lot actually!Pros:Lots of pros! (Heros) all of them bring unquie styles of gameplay, like the quick moving Assassin, to the grapple monster Veteran, to the beatboxing Robo Hobo, to the charging Tank, to the bot pushing Leo and a lot more!Like I mentioned, this game is one of a kind, a 3rd person shooter MOBA with lots of bots you can spawn, like Fuji bots, Bouncers and the Jackbot.The commentators are some of the best in gaming, both feel genuine and are so much fun to listen to, I never get tired of thier lines, despite listening to them over a thousand times.A lot of music! From hawaiian music, rock and roll, digital music, banjos and a lot more!Mascots who give you bonus items! Like Bullseye gives you money, churros and Bacon! Juicebot who gives you fruit which fills up your juice meter! And Chicky Cantor who gives you a huge boost when you defeat him.You can get some free items and boosters! You can connect your Facebook profile to SMNC and get a free assault kit! Which includes the FIreball set, 2 taunts and I think a booster too! There's also a guide which gives codes for boosters too!

A Guide for Super Monday Night Combat
By: snot

			helo		


Unquie looking maps!Has a unquie sporty feel that no other game has created so far.Voice acting is really good and the personality of the characters are great! (Except Gunslinger who is boring and Combat Girl who is just a Sterotype and boobs)Cons:The low population  (Like I mentioned) and the only gamemodes you will be able to play is Turbocross and Blitz, Supercross is 100% dead, you have a higher chance to win the lottery then to find a Supercross match, Blitz is also hard to find matches, speak with players in the chat and see if they want to play, also the most common players you will come across play this game a lot and stomp games over and over, or new players who have no clue what to do... speaking of which...Very steep learning curve, this game is hard to learn due to the lack of a good tutorial, there is one called Training Camp, but you don't learn anything major, like Products, Endorsments, which pros are more deadly or HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO KILL BOTS!(Judging by Turbocross since Super is dead) The balance is all over the place, all the heros (Except Leo and the Veteran) have something OP in them, from Gunner's rocket, Tank's Grenades and charges, Karl's burst, Gunslinger's r*t*rded DPS, Support's Airstrikes, Combat Girl's and Megabeth's.... EVERYTHING! There is at least one OP thing about most Pros, and you will notice them quickly.Do not buy any items, you can unbox most of them thanks to a glitch, if you use a key on a chest/crate/treasure ball, the key doesn't disappear, meaning you can get thousands of rare items.The community is bad, mostly filled with as*h*les who complain and b**ch about everything, there are nice people, like when I came back to this game, a friend gave me some items! Thanks again!Small amount of maps, there's Gun Mountain, Loco Moco, Bullet Gorge, Downtown Spunky, Grenade Arena (My fav,) the Training Camp, and the Blitz map, the normal maps have tons of exploits of them, like Downtown Spunky Megabeth can rocket jump onto a building and attack all the turrets below, Loco Moco's mid can be spammed by Sniper pros and Supports, you can attack the money ball UNDER the map with Assault on Grenade Arena and more. Plus Gun Mountain is the worst map in the game, for $750 you can activate Shelly, aka clear a lane with no effort.The Devs are very shady, while they said they cannot update this game due to the lack of funding, they went on to kickstarter and got their next game funded called Planetary Annihilation, during 2014 they attempted to fund another game called Human Resources, however Planetary Annihilation wasn't close to being finished as it was missing promises from the Kickstarter, which was one of the biggest reasons why Human Resources fell, addtionally they ditched the orignal MNC IN THE SAME YEAR IT WAS RELEASED ON STEAM FOR THIS GAME! As of right now they have pretty much been silent with MNC franchise, just a word of warning when you buy some of their products as they aren't trustworthee, sorry Uber but you lost A LOT of trust with A LOT of customers.Overall this game is one of a kind, lots of upsides and downsides, and I can understand why you don't enjoy this, but give this game a chance, hard to learn, but a lot of fun in the end.If you want to see the current population check the link below.http://steamcharts.com/app/104700 ",161,14,4,10,13,3,11

												Its dead jim, but seriously it was good at one point then the devs decided not to update the game anymore. The Good1. Maps are pretty good and well designed (with supercross in mind) 2. Character balance for the most part is alright3. Good skill ceilingThe Bad1. Small playerbase that is divided by 3 seperate game modes (try dividing 50 players into supercross, turbocross, and blitz)2. Supercross thier bread and butter of the game is dead. Why is this bad you may ask, its because all of the maps, characters, and even products are balanced around this gamemode. (hell even the bots are balanaced for supercross)3. The team comp in higher level play will allways have a assault simply because he deals high damage from a far range, can chase and the sky is the limit for him. His jetpack recharges rediculously fast and it can be angled to go higher then intended by  charging into ramps or by granade jumping. Using the jetpack has no set backs for assault, no aiming penalty like in the first game. TL;DR Assault is OP. 4. Massive Air is still a broken product that they haven't fixed even though it was reported months ago. To put it simply it turns a bad player into a mediocoure one, by speeding them up (which was unintended) and making them harder to grapple (another unintended side effect). To people that don't know what Massive Air is its one of the products in the game that was only intended to give you better jump control. 5. While I'm on the subject of products most of the products in the game are useless. A product to the people that never played this game are passives which activate on certian conditions and even only activate on certain levels. (example parting gift, it activates from level 1 and on and only activates on your death, it heals your team for 350 health and scales with the teamates level) You will only see the products money magnet, juicy spunky, and over armor being used in this game in higher level play or Massive Air for the above reason. Any other product is seldomly used.6. If you took a look at the chowder (beta builds for SMNC) forums, the devs never really listioned to the people who were trying to balance the game, they instead opted to make more characters and more gamemodes instead of fixing the pressing problems in the game which I listed some above. (also one of the devs got wrecked in a beta scrim and opted to nerf veteren out of spite and not game balance)7. The community has divided into two parts, super try hards and people who just wanna have fun, the sad part is the latter part of the community for the most part is dying off or going to other games. Really don't bother unless your are decient at the game which can only happen if you managed to play it before supercross died off for good.8. This is probiblly the killer of the game but doesnt apply anymore since the ques for supercross are dead but still could bring to light why supercross is dead. At level 0-20 when you first get the game you are put into ques with people of your own skill level (aka a newbie camp) so you dont have to worry about vets stomping you. The moment you reached level 21 you are put into the general que and many many people would get stomped, causing them to quit the game because they weren't ready. 9. The in game voice chat is dead, and has been dead for over a year now. (stopped working Novemember 2012) The devs still didn't fix this issue.10. The game hasn't been patched for almost a year from me writing this review even though they got a volunteer to fix the bugs in the game (apperently they messed up the coding really really really badly in unreal 3) said bug fixes from the volunteer never got into SMNC, and the only person who was working on the bug fixes got reassigned to work on thier other game Planetary Anhilation.11. The free character roster has been the same 6 characters for 9 months from me writing this review, the rouster is supposed to change weekly to let people try out the 18 characters before they buy them.All in all DON'T PLAY THIS GAME UNTILL UBER FIXES IT (which sadly will be never).

												Since Steam had the gall to recc me this game in the new Steam Discovery update, I thought I'd write a review of the game in it's current state since it's abandonment. This game used to be GREAT. I bought Monday Night Combat a few months before Super MNC was released, and enjoyed a few hours of it but never got into it addictively. When Super MNC came out I was all over it. It was free2play, had a lot more options, characters, and got quite a bit of hype from a tie-in with Team Fortress 2 and one of the first games to incorporate Steam trading. It had a multitude of modes, a competitive but somewhat friendly community, and there were little to no problems besides a few occasional glitches to ruin the experience. Then the devs/publishers threw the community under the bus. They insisted while they were working on Planetary Annihilation that they'd continue support for this game, even if it meant just minor updates/champ rotation/fixes. But they outright lied, and never officially announced abandoning the game and left the cash shop open. The matchmaking is completely broken, there's some BS number in-game that states how many players are on, and the community is just a few random vets with complete newbies who have no idea the game is dead, with a huge gap of experience/character upgrades between these two groups.Uber is by no means a helpless small indie developer that doesn't have the resources to continue support for this game. Uber received over 2 million US dollars in Kickstarter money (with a project goal of 900k) for their new game, Planetary Annihilation, which has turned out into a slight disappointment in my opinion; although a few people in the Steam User Forums will insist the game's poor performance and their promise of offline -play is only because ""they [Uber Entertainment] just needs more money/time"". After receiving this large sum of money, Uber also charged $90 for alpha access to those who did not donate to their Kickstarter, and $50 for beta, all the while keeping silent on Super MNC and continuing to let it rot. This gives you an idea of Uber's recent shortcomings although you're free to look into them yourself and come to your own conclusions.Another recent Super MNC reccomendation writer stated that Uber has stated on their forums they have interest in reviving this game if ""given the chance"", but they've had plenty and I hope these are not empty words. I'd love to continue to convert friends back to this game, even if Uber didn't do content updates but fixed matchmaking and updated Pro rotation.			",491,128,6,60,35,7,91

												At this point in time, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.For starters, it has been abandoned by the creators.  The game revolves around a set of classes, or ""pros"".  Back in its heyday, the pros would be a free rotation, where 5-6 of them were free, a few of them were on sale, and the others were full price.  Since it was abandoned, the free pros haven't rotated at all.  This leaves you backed into a corner of hoping you enjoy one of the free pros, or spending money on a pro you have no idea you'll like.  Not that I recommend you even get that far.Secondly, the community is completely cannibalistic.  In higher population games, this isn't a problem.  This genre in particular (MOBAs), has quite an inclination to rage fits,♥♥♥♥♥♥talking, and general immaturity even more-so than you'll experience in Call of Duty.  Again, in higher populated communities, this isn't a big deal, you'll just move on to another game and have less than a .01% chance of running into the same jackass twice.  Well, SMNC has less than 200 active at peak times, and all the people playing this game are a rotating cast of alphas, betas, and pro players.  So if you like getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by the same pub stomp team over and over again, dive in!The chief game mode this was designed around doesn't even function anymore, due to low population/lack of interest from alpha/beta/pro players.  They would rather instant-gib you on the more deathmatch like ""Turbocross"" game mode.  There's a sick sense of enjoyment they get from stomping the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of new players, regardless of the fact that this drives them away within an hour of play.  If you don't believe me, sit in on them while they converse on mumble, or spend a few minutes on the Uberent forums.So, if you like getting stomped, an impossible learning curve, horrendous population/matchmaking, and no further development from the company, this game is for you.  In its prime, SMNC was unique, fun, and had an awesome community to be a part of.  Calling it a shadow of it's former self would be an understatement.  A year or two ago, this game was a 5/5.  Now, it's a 1/5.  Tawokwww.GuildLeaders.com ",202,23,3,29,26,1,19

												This game was cool when it first launched and was in ""Beta"". Then it turned into one of those infinite betas that never actually finished but still had a premium cash shop you could spend real money on anyways.Before finishing the game Uber decided to start work on Planetary Annihilation, after which Super MNC died and was taken over by trolls and whiny teenagers. Co-incidentally to this review (not) Uber recently ""launched"" Planetary Annihilation, another unfinished product that doesn't even have offline single player or the ability to save skirmishes against AI. (I do hear it has the ability to crash, or run at less than 60 frames per second 99% of the time.)At this point, I say avoid Uber's games, they take money for unfinished products and then move on to their next cash grab.Inb4 Uber announces a new game before finishing PA or Super MNC. (Hah, finish this game? Uber abandoned it a year ago, that's not gonna happen.)Edit: Only one month later than I wrote this review Uber announced their latest game, Human Resources. Once again they are Kickstarting a new game before any of their old games have been finished. I really want to like their games, they look really cool, but they're all unfinished.

												SMNC is a game I really want to recommend, but I cannot. While I have enjoyed this game for well over a hundred hours, the developers (Uber) are no longer creating content for the game. The source code has been given to someone outside the company who is not being paid for his work and therefore content patches are nearly non-existent. On top of this, there are still numerous issues within the game and the fact that the community is also nearly non-existent does not help; SMNC was quite popular at one point, but now since the dev's don't care and are working on another game (namely Planetary Annihilation) many players have obviously left for greener pastures, myself included. Overall, the IP has great character and I truly enjoyed my time with SMNC, however I cannot reccomend it any longer.			",168,18,2,22,10,2,25

												Rest in peace, Super Monday Night Combat. I'll never forget those cozy monday nights, playing a few rounds of Turbocross as Leonardo da Vinci, shooting lasers at a poor man in a mascot costume, then eating his churros off of the floor. But the few players the game had were only in it for the Team Fortress hats, and you died too young. May you some day rise from the ashes and gain the playerbase you deserved.

But a combination of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ monetization and poor development ultimatly killed. This♥♥♥♥♥♥could have been big, it could have been amazing.

												Don't even bother. This game is a waste. The game itself was good. It was really fun. However, pretty much no one plays it now. It's a miracle if you find a match to play in, because there is no one online. The game is so dead, I'm surprised it is still on the Steam store to be honest. I mean, you can't even access your inventory on Steam anymore, which I know will have upset many of the past players of this game as a lot of players will have put money into the game. If this game ever somehow has a massive revival, then I for one will be playing it again, but that doesn't look likely, and quite frankly, it's a huge waste, because this game was brilliant. It's an absolute pity.			",88,12,2,8,6,3,6

												How to play this game:1: download the game2: Play it till lvl 20 when you get the pyro hat.3: Uninstall the game.Some tips:+Play Blitz. Blitz is the fastest way of leveling up+Invite everyone to your game, the more the people the more experience everyone gets.+Ask your team for tips. Everyone is there for the hats and everyone wants to get out of that game the fastest way posible+Use these two codes in the game store: 4070-9098 2718-2818 They will give you an experience boost and shorter the suffering.+The matchmaking is garbage so be patient.+Mute the comentator. And put your favorite music while you play. The voice chat doesnt work so you'll only miss their obnoxious and tacky comments.Also this game is stupid, the character designs are horrible, the matchmaking sucks, the game is stupid x2, the help are text walls, there are missoginistic jokes in, the community is full of people who just wants the pyro hat and toxic tryhards there was a lot of potential in this game but it was wasted in stupid decisions.

												SMNC, the sleeper hit I ended up loving dearly. It's a huge shame Uber has a habit of making games and never fleshing them out. This could have been an extremely popular game if they didn't abandon it. While ""MOBAs"" are not for everyone, this one combines FPS elements into the core game. This makes for the best FPS/MOBA on the market in my opinion. There has never been another game I've ever enjoyed as much as this one. FPS or MOBA. Please Uber I'm begging you, come back to your red-headed step child and give it the love and care it needs to flourish.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, after so many hours I can say without any hesitation that I know about 100% this game has to offer.I was there when it came out of beta, I saw it being developed, I saw it fall... slowly. It was and still is quite a ride. I know its history, I kinda know people who play, not personally, mostly in the arena and chat, all of them have unique play styles even those I despise. I just want to say ""this game is awesome"", but that just wouldn't be enough.So, without further delay.Super Monday Night Combat,  a third person blood sport arena shooter pact with adrenaline and excitement. Taking place in a distant future with 17 unique characters (pros) to choose from, all with unique skills and abilities. From slow and tanky to fast and slicy, thrown into one of the 5 arenas to fight for money and fame.Good things:The graphics are satisfying, with plenty of options to modify in your menu so even those coal running pcs can handle it.Sound, sound effects and music is clear, fun and spot on. The characters, their abilities, their weapons and map hazzards make unique sounds that are clear which is very important considering the fast pased gameplay. Even the announcers are helpful as they give you tips, inform you if something important happens or about to happen.Gameplay is fast paced and responsive as long you have at least decent connection.It has a tutorial level, training camp where you find basic information.No way to boost your gameplay performance with real money, you have to play and buy such items with in game currency, basicly no pay to win bs.Teamwork is encouraged.Bad things: The developers no longer support this game. The servers are up and not comming down any time soon as far as I know. Support with technical issues is still up too if you find yourself in troble with something. But the further game development has stopped.Population is low, still you find games in turbocross only which takes a few minutes at day time, but there aren't enough people for supercross or in general.A few bugs here and there but nothing critical, just annoying.Can't think of anything else bad. Nothing else bothers me.Conclusion:3rd person view team arena combat filled with fast paced gameplay. This game can be compared to Battleborn and Smite, but still has its own unique taste. It is free, easy to set up and get going, but hard to master. If you like something like that or would like to try, then this game is definitely for you..			",371,87,10,51,28,5,41

Super Monday Night Combat is an innovative, third-person arena shooter.Pros: Graphics, Sound, Controls, GameplayCons: CommunityFrom the sleek Assassin to the hulking Jackbot, the graphics look superb.  The music and sound mesh well with the gameplay, with the roaring crowd, gunfire, and cheeky advertisements.  A controller or a keyboard and mouse work very well.  Finally and above all else, Super Monday Night Combat is simply fun, standing out among numerous FPS clones and DotA-style mobas with unique and challenging mechanics.However, one simple flaw serves to demolish all fun to be had: the community has dwindled, leaving Super MNC's pick-up-and-play style a thing of the past.7/10			",174,41,0,29,7,0,9

												Well I think it's safe to say the game is dead now, which is a shame because it's still one of the best MOBA's out there, and it's still a ton of fun if you can find a match with full teams. It's a shame the developer abandoned it, as it would still be alive and well if they didn't just bail for focus on Planetary Annihilation (I'm pretty sure they bailed on the initial build of that and ""re-released"" the same game for an additional cost for the initial buyers). Had they kept updating this, they likely would have had funds for future failures elsewhere, but they would have kept this gem and it's community alive. I recommend it because it was an awesome game, but you'll need to be patient with it if you want to find a match to play now.			",366,26,1,30,11,1,15

												This is a class based 3rd person shooter along the lines of a MOBA. I've given it a shot 3 times and really, it just failed to capture my interest like TF2 did. Its got quirky characters, a good art style and fun weapons, its just I'd rather be playing TF2. Like a MOBA game, there are bots on each map that allow you to level up your character so you can actually have a level advantage over other players on the map. So basically attack bots and avoid players until you get a level advantage to take out players all while collecting experience. Its a good system, it just made me want to play TF2. There is a lot of player customization too, which is nice, but eh.While I have only played 15 or so hours, I felt that spawn killing was far too common, because so many new fresh players come to Super MNC hoping to get TF2 hats that they don't understand how to play. A skilled player can just dominate an entire map and one player can overpower an entire team. The tutorial was pretty bad and I didn't really still didn't understand the game upon my 3rd time playing it. I feel a lot of people must not understand it, because there are players asking what they do or why the other 'players' are so dumb they walk into shots fired, when they don't understand the 'players' are bots, not actual humans.Really, just get your TF2 hats and get out or don't bother playing this game. TF2 is a superior game, but if you understand MOBAs and love 3rd person shooters. Then this game is totally for you.			",1125,324,51,104,96,15,167

												Like almost everyone who plays this game, I came for the TF2 hats. And to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised at how fun it was. I especially liked the co-op mode, which is like MvM in TF2 except infinitely less stressful and more fun. In fact, the only reason (granted, quite a major reason) that I'm not giving it a thumbs-up is that it's essentially dead. Its developers have adandoned the project entirely, and the last time new content was added was about 3 years ago. That means that almost nobody's on, and the few that are tend to be salty tryhards that are too stubborn to admit the game is long dead. Valve, while not necessarily taking into consideration the desires of the community, constantly updates TF2, and for that reason it's more fun overall. My advice is to only download this game for the hats, and avoid spending money on taunts and cosmetics.			",32,2,0,0,2,2,0

												Ladies and Gentlemen.I would like to present:ALPHA MONDAY NIGHT COMBAT.I can't really describe how much potential Monday Night Combat title had. UberEnt really ruined it.If you want to play something FAST PACED, then I recommend simple, Monday Night Combat. SMNC is nothing more than Alpha MNC. A lot of good stuff were implemented but a lot of stuff were also ruined.Same goes with the prices. First introduce GOLDEN GUNS - 10$. A 10$ for a F-ing CHEAP Photoshop edit.Not to mention how many times UberEnt scammed people. Some people ACTUALLY PAID for ASSAULT PACK (from store) but suddenly they decided to give Facebook users ASSAULT PACK for FREE.Don't spend any cents on any UberEnt titles. They will ruin more games.Sincerely- Coverop			",241,37,3,11,17,5,19

												---Let's be fair: I am primarily just writing this ""review"" as a retrospective rather than ""should I give money to this game""-essay.I'd say it's still worth writing this, so here goes:------Here are some bullet-points why I don't recommend this game:- You can only queue in a single queue at the time.Before the more or less accidental release from the closed-beta-phase, there was a time you could queue on all regions / servers / datacenters.Granted, there was only single game-mode also, the ""SuperCrossfire"".Had this been feature however re-added as they UberEnt wanted to, the queueing would have been a lot less of hassle.Here is a link with a  screenshot with ""Ekanaut"" himself more or less confirming they wanted to re-implement the feature:https://forums.uberent.com/threads/remove-region-player-counts.30497/#post-448477- Imbalanced ""Meta""Primarily this goes to actual ""meta""-things called ""Products"", since you cannot equip or otherwise buy & get inside battles itself (same things are with ""Endorsement"").To put it simply: There were a lot on Products / Passive-buff that either were for the most part really useless (especially the ""Death & Respawn-effects"" like ""Snappy Comeback"" that gave 30-seconds run-speed-buff every time you respawned; an very counter-productive-buffs you for the most part don't want to die at all in this game);and simply over-powered(E.G.""Hot Hands"" that has the base damage of 20-damage/second for 5-second-period to each enemy you grapple / grapples you every 10-seconds; only way you could semi-counter this as to either have a ""pocket-medic""-team or using a product called ""Asbestos"" which in practice halved the burn-durations).((I may have some numbers slightly wrong. But point still stands some products were simply far too over-powerful...))Aside for the Death and respawn-products, these meta-buffs didn't have a counter / downside-effect (aside maybe for the Respawn + Death-products), so it was for the most part pointless to ""not"" carry all the three product-slots filled.- Exploits and generally UberEnt-folks endorsing thisRanging from far too easy spawn-point-camping (both player and bot / ""minion""-spawns) to players going to out-of-reach-spots where they're for the most completely safe (especially flying to those places with character called ""Assault"".Biggest exploit being ""turret / ""tower""-cheesing"", which means damage the turret out-of-the-reach or otherwise from angles the turrets cannot counter at all (primarily by ""clipping"" gun-models through walls or poking behind corners, since the turret / towers only aim the center the of the character-models).In all scenarios the developers for most part simply say ""Git gud!"", to summarize it best.Exploits itself probably described the ""majority"" of the players the best: If it helped them to win, they did it, always.Actually, the player-spawn points ""deserve"" its own section:The biggest flaw of it was that it only had three very narrow doorways (like you could barely fit two player-characters next to each other next to these, or maybe you couldn't at all (or at least this is how it seemed)).Due how narrow these doorways are, for the most part players inside the ""spawn-dome"" had pretty much zero-chances to fight back the campers outside, especially if there was extra walls nearby to hide behind (""Bullet Gorge""-arena being the worst offender of this by even allowing higher-ground vantage-points thanks to jump-pads!).And considering how really easily / abruptly the ""primary""-mode (""SuperCrossfire"") ""snowballed"", it was simply just horrid...---There are few things however that still makes me wish we could remake or otherwise revive this game:+ Replay-functionSure, it wasn't the most intuitive just like replay-systems generally are. But it's far more better than having no replay-system at all.+ Player-charactersDefinitely the biggest draw of the whole game was the character-roster. Pretty much everything is just right; just right; I really find anything that one could ""improve""-about them (aside maybe related to following thing).And my goodness, the animation: Even in 2016 I've yet to see as perky or otherwise this good'&'smooth ""cartoon"" animation.Whoever people part of the animation-team(s), I really hope to see more games with these animation (styles?).I just wish they could have included rest / all of the old animations plus lines from the previous game (""Old"" Monday Night Combat (1)) (mainly the lip-sync and such).+ World, Lore, WhatnotsIn semi-symbiosis with the character-roster is the world-building.From the arenas itself to announcer / commenter-talk / banter, this game certainly feels like a real universe instead of just a game with random characters that just happens to be there. I.E. the characters actually feel like having a genuine purpose there fighting / being gladiators in these arenas (I.E. to simply put: They're specifically constructed clones(?) fighting for the entertainment of people watching).Basically, for the most part I don't question at all why this all is happening (at least I don't; heck I'd be more than happy to watch sapient(?)-gorillas duking out with ""Leonardo Da Vinci"" all day, if I could that is).+ The gameplay-itself was actually goodExploits aside, the gameplay itself was really good.They could have made the gameplay-better by making the exploits not worth (E.G: making turrets take less damage the further you were away from them, alongside not pushing with bots / ""minions"").But otherwise the pacing, abilities / skills (aside maybe for the lack of ""telegraphing"" or other indicators / tell-tales), everything gameplay-wise was actually solid and really-really good,Best thing was of course that bot / ""minion""-kills were shareable; as long as you kept damaging / ""tagging"" them, you had a chance to get a bot-kill thus level-up plus get money for in-battle-purchases.I personally think relating all damage to singular ""damage-rating""-stats was actually quite clever.In case you'll more info what I am talking about, I have a quite detailed guide written about it:


Damage Rating 101 
A Guide for Super Monday Night Combat
By: Pave

			The Basics of Damage rating in SMNC and what does it do. The original more often updated version can be found at offcial forums of Uber Entertaiment.		


((I highly recommend reading the UberEnt-forum version too for more up-to-date / non-""link-rot""-version of the guide.))And of course, it was an actual 3-dimensional ""Shooter MOBA"" with Z-axis and such; jumping especially had a purpose (primarily to dodge ground-slam-shock-waves).------So yeah, Super Monday Night Combat ""was"" a good game at the base.But unfortunately the developers failed / were apparently not willing to to make this game more fair-and-square and fun to to play (true, fun is subjective thing).At least the players who got for the most part those who got spawn-camped, cheesed, or otherwise beaten due exploits for the most part more than likely didn't have fun.---------			",1883,704,67,217,260,21,337

												My best MOBA experience.  But it died due to a short lived balance issue that was more minor than most balance issues in MOBAs out there.  Namely Smite as a whole, Dota 2's time of Troll Warlord or Juggernaut = automatic win, or League's current toxic instant death on low cooldowns meta.  We really need to repopulate this game so it'll get worked on again so League and Smite will stop getting the playerbases they don't deserve.			",38,2,0,1,1,0,1

												Ehh...Ehh...I don't know, this is the kind of game I wish steam would add a 'maybe' recommend button for. So ima lean towards the 'No' button and let 2~5 people downvote this before reading. Anyways, It's like TF2 but it didn't trap me into it as well. I'd still recommend giving it a shot, it's still fairly fun and there are a few people who still play it...at the right time of day. It's just more of a race of 'who can make the next TF2 clone' to me. Most recently was Loadout and now Blizzard is making Overwatch...Not that it's bad, I just wish people published more unique games rather then making re-makes based off of another hit game.

												A great and funny game.Though this is free to play you have NO possibility to buy ingame advantages.You can use your steam wallet's cash to buy great looking armor and weapons. This stuff has no influence on your stats.You can also buy boosters but they are totally worthless and won't influence much. :-) So don't worry.This game is more about tactic than about going after kills. The more of the enemy bots you kill the faster you level up. 2nd is you shouldn't get killed. Third is: Destroy the enemy.If you are interested in this game, just try it. It is free anyway. Just one important thing:DO NOT START SUPER CROSSFIRE GAME MODE.Because of the small playerbase it will take forever to get a match at Super Crossfire. Just play TURBOCROSS. You will find matches even faster. Sometimes I have to exit the lobby and restart so I get a match after about 2 minutes. But that's really the worst case scenario.There are even some nice guides.

They did the same thing with the 1st Monday night combat and I will never play or support anything again that Uber Ent. has anything to do with. I spent over $1000 on SMNC.

												This is a great game, if you know what you're doing. Fast paced lane action, I think this combines FPS and MOBA almost flawlessly (with the exception of getting oneshot by the turrets :P) Learn each of the different classes (pros in this game) in the training zone BEFORE you play them in a ranked match. My personal favorite is probably the Assassin, despite how hard she is to play (i.e. bouncing off the walls to end up backstabbing someone.) Overall, tons of triggerhappy fun, free TF2 items, and humor that'll keep you laughing while on the edge of your seat. This is so much more fun with friends too! (Skype calls, you never fail to amuse me.)			",78,2,3,6,3,3,5

												Matchmaking is dead.Community veterans is only way,but they are agressive.And was not fixed for 1+years...Again,this game is also imbalanced thanks to no updates and such.It was good,but from now its a dead trash.You still have *hope* to it? No,for now. The devs currently working for insanely hard Planetary Annihilation(which is unbalanced). Well,how about balance your updates?So,positive reviews forced you to dislike mine? Well,how about counter to that...The game imbalances are coming...First,this game has an abuse with...Massive air. Yes abused. It gives a speed boost if you bunny hop,and well,it wansn't fixed snice then. Another disbalance is cheesing. Snice a player can keep damaging a tower to pervent backing its shields up(in crossfire)or just destroying it by staying out of its range and shooting it,this makes another *hole* in gameplay.Second,this game has a different network,which makes players who has a higher ping to shoot MUCH less accurately as ping increases. Those who have a low ping have an upper hand in accuracy.Third,a good team will always have an assault,because of his quick recharging jetpack(which is OP),grenade lanucher(also OP)and has no aiming penlaty while doing it.Oh yes,keep saying its good,actually its IMBALANCED. For now. Till the devs will listen to us.Still downvoting? Scroll down through negative reviews,and you find old ones,that explain everything bad about this game.			",654,274,15,86,53,3,84

												Super MNC is the most F@#%!*& SUPER CRAZY AWESOME 3rd PERSON SHOOTER MOBA OF ALL HISTORY OF CRAZY MOBA'S IS JUST PERFECT AND..... DEAD!In my opinion, is the best moba game of all history, SMNC contains everything, or almost everything you can imagine, explosions, robots, weapons, a gorilla, lady with guns and much more. No need spend real money to get good itens, of course if you pay you get itens more fast (and buy outfits only can be puchased with real money), but if you play a day or two, maybe three you can buy a new character or new gear to up your abilitys. unfortunately the game need players, much much players, you need wait a long time to enter or create a game with full teamsPros:-Amazing-Simple-Very very very funny-Guns-Beautiful girls with guns-Explosions-Crazy gameplay-AmazingAgainst:-Missing players-I was another topic, but I forget it			",33,4,0,5,2,0,2

												A fast-paced third-perdon shooter. It's really fun. All game modes really focus on one central thing (which isn't bad.). Escorting robots to the enemy team's ""moneyball"" , whih is guarded by rocket turrents, and destroying it all, while defending your own. You pick a ""pro"" to fight as. They each have their own skills and pros and cons. You can upgrade your skills, as well as your offensive (more damage, etc.) and defensive (more speed, etc.) (for the match being) in the heat of battle. There's a mascot that contantly runs around dropping money (which can be used to buy powerups in battle) and health items, and juice. Get enough juice, you become overpowered for a short time.    Another reason to get this game is you can get two hats for Team Fortress 2.  Bad thing is the game is dead. The devs no longer update it or anything. But should you really care? No. Play it. It's worth while.			",112,7,2,4,3,0,4

-note-outside blitz mode its best to ask in chat for a invite.A fps that plays like dota2. The main game consists of pushing lanes and taking out ""towers"" to get the the opponents money ball.You start each match at level 1 and can level upto 15 and on each level you can upgrade 1 of your 4 powers.As you play you will get money for bot & player kills.You use this money to activate turrets, jump pads, spawn bots, power-ups, Shelly (fires rockets in one side of the level damaging opponents) and a annihilator that will kill all the opposing teams bots.There is also a blitz mode where you try to defend a money ball through as many bot waves as you can.The game has many characters or pros for different play styles and it helps game play if teams don't have to many of the same kind of pro on a team.Sadly most that can get a game now just play blitz mode because of the rampant exploiting in the other modes.Another problem is the levels anyone starting fresh will get matched with high level players (do to low population) and they normally just beat the crap out of you wile trolling and calling you names.The game is no longer updated and there is even a glitch for opening an infinite about of treasure balls.it's a fun game but its in a sad place do to neglect.

												Super MNC is the new moba generation I don't like , I used to love the old MNC i still play sometimes , too bad there are a few players still playing . In the old MNC you could place turrets now you can't is just like in Dota2 , League of Legends , etc. once a turret is destroyed is destroyed for good .The game has it's own bad things , you hardly farm credits for the stuff you want .... and that sux , but this new MNC has plenty of new champions which i like . My favourite still remains the asssasin , i don't know to play something else and i don't wanna learn ;D If i recommend it  ? Yes , I really do , and you know why ? Because despite the things i hate from Super MNC this game has great potential and I cannot deny that . Ofcourse the matchmaking still sux but the game itself is wonderful , So let's play :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was a great game in it's day. The only problem is that Uber Entertainment owned it.There we're about as many people playing Battleborn after 1 month as SMNC had after 1 year.It's a shame Uber is known for abandoning their games.I rate it Odokee out of 10.Odokee is still waiting for a match even now. Because this was all he had in life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly would have been a great game if UberEnt didn't abandon it without warning.  This was the third-person DotA-esque experience before SMITE came out, the team shooter with unique hero abilities and shiz back when Overwatch was still just that super vague Project Titan.   Had a pathetically bad F2P setup though which is what really shot it in the foot.  Gameplay-wise none of the team-based/MOBA-ish shooters to come out so far have really tried to capture what SMNC and its predecessor (Monday Night Combat) did.   Really was a gem.  Too bad it was left to rot in maintenance mode when it could have been a huge name if it had a more competent team running its monetization model.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game and I'm having loads of fun playing it. Yes, the community isn't so big anymore, but if you actually try you will always find someone to play with. Personally, I play almost exclusively the game mode ""Super Blitz"" where you and a team of up to 4 more players fight off waves of bots to defend your Money Ball. Around 90% of the time I manage to get a full 5 person team together. That isn't too bad if you ask me.The Pros (characters) are fun and unique and each game a new adventure.

												Tbh I enjoyed playing this game when it first came out, but couldn't play it much becuase it was too laggy. When I finally got a better PC I reinstalled it, but the game had already died out so I stopped again. Then I started playing again to get the TF2 items but it was difficult with the lack of players which resulted in long queues to even play. I wouldn't recommend downloading the game becuase there are no players to play it, but I'm not giving it a bad review/recommendation cause the game was actually a lot of fun when you did get to play it.

												Dead? No. No supported with updates? Yes. Bad? No.Super MNC is a Dota x TF2. A very enjoyable game that will give you a vast ammount of time of fun. Each class has personality that will always be entertaining (well until it just gets annoying).It can be hard to get a lobby or game going at some parts of the day since the game is more barren than it used to be. The only things that keep this game alive are people that still enjoy the game at base and people like me that went to get TF2 hats which I still didn't get the final peice after 11 hours.It is free and you can get hats for TF2 so I recommend it and I know that some of you people that have 100s of hours in this game hate me for it but deal with. The devs don't update the game with content and you can get free hats for a more popular game. I'm sorry.			",426,111,11,48,30,7,75

												Unique looking and excelent graphics, unbalanced and not newbie-friendly gameplay.Some characters are overpowered.Complicated upgrade system (products, endorcements etc), complicated menu, NO kick voting in case a hacker joins the game or someone is abusing a glitch.All followed by an un-friendly community (Some players were reported multiple times but nothing happened, bullying problems ) and a very close community (Few people are online), sometimes servers are down.From my experience what I enjoyed the most are the graphics and the unique interaction between the player and the 3rd person shooter as well as the great animations.I would reccomend the game this game to someone who is characterised as ""Gaming Pro"" but definitely not to someone who has the same experience as I have ( low ).I really regret spending money on this game to buy new characters.Uber, on their try to make a new game with fancy graphics forgot that the gameplay matters as well.And not only that but they try to make people forget that this game is a rival of Monday Night Combat, by removing support ( But you still have to pay Monday Night Combat to play!""What I see is a company with great graphic skills to try desperately to make a new game to attract players.

												If you're looking for something a bit out of the ordinary then you might want to check out Super Monday Night Combat, it's a MOBA game mixed with a 3rd person shooter and it works surprisingly well.The game looks good, has a great sense of humor, and the controls are responsive and easy to learn. The gameplay mainly centers around killing bots on a lane to escort your bots to turrets and eventually the opposite team's moneyball. Fairly straightforward, but it takes a few rounds to learn how things work. A lot of playable characters so there's sure to be someone who fits your playstyle, and they're adding more all the time.If you feel like trying something new, this is for you. Just be sure to play with some friends.			",471,68,18,20,17,4,29

Why are only 5 of them avalible at the start? And I spent at least 2 minutes on the home page trying to exit the game.

												Super MNC is an TD like game with FPS elements and RPG. Maybe you can it also describe as a Moba. The aim is to destroy all robots of the other teams. For that you can built-up turret and uplevel them. Your character is important, too. You can choose Assassin, Supporters, Strikers or Assault. Many things in this game are fancy like gorillas as chars or to kill a chicken or the juicy boy. Guess that should be funny.But for Newbies it's a lot of distraction from the main game concept. The easiest mode is Blitz with 5 players destroying waves of robots. After round 20 it's getting nasty. Here can only the Pros survive. You'll gain a lot of XP here.The other mode is Crossstrike where 1vs1 to max 5vs5 can play. you have to check everytime the map and support your robot armys on their way to the other team's core. That makes fun.But for some reason you will get in this mode only about 10% XP of Blitz mode.That wouldn't be neccessary to explain, if you don't need the XP to equip you char with better endorsements. And though the game is F2P you can buy XP for real money 6500XP = $3. The prices are annoying. For a complete outfit you can pay $15. You should test it once and try to reach all achievements. In Daytime there are only 40 players inside ...			",1640,665,58,135,164,17,216

												This game is like if you came to late to Woodstock:- no band playing on the stage- it was definitely fun.... somewhere back in the time when people where there- looks and feels like a terrible mess- no one can tell you where the toilets are- nobody is there anymore, only the most notorious crack junkiesso do NOT bother to drive there ;)			",60,12,0,10,11,0,4

												FPS that is actually a tower defense and a MOBA with futuristic ""creeps"" and all kind of weird objectives (towers, pickups, etc.)Learning curve is pretty high like in almost all MOBA's, where the point of ""not sucking"" is higher than most games and comes with your play experience.Fun humor and stylistic choices. It resembles a lot the style of TF2 to be honest.Not that bad if you want to get into a MOBA and you also want to shoot people. Just try it and see if it's your type.			",155,36,5,12,10,1,27

												Unique game which is free ofc with mirco transactions that arent really micro however they do go on sale alot of times. This game is a fast pace third person moba game wahtever its called and its really fun. the background commentary is quite funny and sometimes quite useful. The background commentary also never repeat in my experiences. For low levels it is really hard to find matches meaning you have to make a customs matches with higher level people which mean you either lose horribly or get carried in most moba games. Another down note it has a lack of players meaning if you dont want to make a custom match with randoms and want to solo queue it will take about 30 mins+ for people level 1-19. Some positive notes the classes are balanced and none are really that OP however the diffcult pros are really weak if you dont know how to play the class. I find that once your under level you really cant catch up useless they become monkeys are lose the game on purpose.    IN CONCLUSION: This game is FUN as it is really unique to the games we currently have now. However mirco transactions are really pricy and lack new players. I recommend that they should add more customization and reduce prices on mirco transactions to somewhat a $1 USD for taunts and things. They should also improve matchmaking with randoms and make more servers cause they only have 3 regional servers Australia,North america and Europe. i recommend that people should pick this game up since it is Free.

												Listen to me.This is an amazing game, the ONLY problem I have with it is the lack of players. If reviewing this is the only way to get my 100+ Friends to see this game, so be it.It's half MOBA, half Third-Person Shooter, all free, and you can get TF2 Hats!Also, there is a mode where you fight infinite Minions until your thingummy blows up - great for earning XP - get those Hats quicker!

												The only way I would recommend this game is if they would give the community the ability to take the game over so it can be updated and get new life.

They need to start a kickstarter, or let the community take the reigns..otherwise this game shouldn't even be accessible..			",125,7,1,6,4,0,18

												This game is like TF2+ Moba so it's similar to a bad over watch. The game is really fun altho matches can be hard to find. The game is dead except for the Blitz game mode (Aus) even then i get like 200 ping but it's still pretty fun. There are a few stupid things like you have to go into the menu to level up so you get shot at and there are issues with class balancing. Although i didn't play any of the proper game mode i've heard it's liek a moba 5v5. Pretty much fail over watch but third person shooter. 7/10 underated game. A good f2p that died too quickly.

												I guess I'll post a short piece: It's a MOBA done as a 3rd person shooter with a bit of character customization. The style of it is done as a futuristic televised arena. There's a vid on the store page that explains the gameplay, so I won't really get into the details here. I'm going to recommend the game because it is fun  - B U T - The game has lost a lot of momentum being 3 years old and getting players to stick around is going to be difficult. If they did, maybe it would draw more players in. Maybe. But then most people don't want to put that kind of effort into it when their game itch could be sated elsewhere. I'm only guessing that a lot of the recent negative reviews are sour because there's a lack of player base and having a healthy player base is really important for a game like this.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played it to the point where I got the TF2 hats.  Didn't understand a thing.  After pouring time into Dota 2 and LoL, it makes a lot more sense.Certainly not bad, its a MOBA with third person shooter centric gameplay.  Even without knowing the basics of the MOBA genre, it was fun because ""shoot the other color"" is a pretty basic combat to grasp.  I'm pretty sure my teammates were raging at me because all I was doing was firing whatever explosive weapon I had at the bots and jumping around like an idiot, but every once in a while I got a kill or pressed that big middle button that made bots explode.  Even without understanding the in depth mechanics of the game, you can have fun if you can actually find a match.  My main issue is that there are a limited number of characters and it does the League thing of making only a select few available for free.			",148,22,1,15,6,4,10

												Well no. I didnt enjoy playing it. Not at all. It feels unbalanced and almost unplayable for new players. Some great ideas are packet with anger and 4/15 score for most newcomers. No wonder that game is almost dead when its so unfriendly to new players. And no, it wasnt just me. There are old players who dominate others and feels like they do 3x times more dmg with the same character. I am glad I have all achievements so no need to turn it on ever again. 5/10			",672,214,21,98,50,9,119

												The Monday Night Combat series consists of two 3rd person mobas.If you need a refresher on what a 3rd person moba is, then go take a look at Smite.Smite is directly competing against other, big name mobas such as DOTA2 and League of Legends.What makes it special is the third person perspective.Super MNC brings a LOT to the moba table, but at the same time, leaves you with so little...While other mobas are all stuck in a self-perpetuating cyclone centering around the high fantasy artstyle, Monday Night Combat is sports themed. Thats right, kids. Sports. They even have commentators and sponsorshipsThe world of MNC is robust with many sound assets and nice, shiny icons. However, after a week or so of playing, its easy for any gamer to distinguish a clear lack of content.The ""Pros"" (otherwise known as ""Heroes"" or ""Champions"" in other mobas) all have their own unique abilities, weapons and roles making teamplay a very interesting and engaging experience. Fighting 5v5 alongside an army of lesser warriors to achieve a common, territorrial goal. Just like any other moba.The big difference that you will see after prolonged play in Super MNC, is the clear lack of pros. Big name mobas will release new characters once a month, on average. These competitors also sport enormous rosters, all tweaked for balance. Though I will argue MNC is balanced to some degree, there is no customization outside picking from a pool of limited characters. The downfall of this game is a clear lack of community involvement in light of the limited roster.Uber went into this with the best intentions, and for a while it was good. However, the moba genre takes an incredible amount of maintenance to keep things fresh. Especially in a market so competitive.If you liked this game, or want to see what a 3rd person moba can do, check out Smite. Otherwise hope on DOTA2.This game will always hold a special place in my heart. I bought the original, I played with friends. I made new friends. I laughed at many of the voices, and many of the gags in this game will always bring back warm feelings. The sad fact of the matter is that mobas cannot stand the test of time. When we look at it, every multiplayer game will eventually reach its demise.Farewell.			",47,1,0,1,1,1,2

												Pros:- Brilliant concept. The game presents itself as a future sport like The Running Man or Rollerball, leaning heavily towards the aesthetic of Smash TV.- Beautiful game in every way. A bit light on art assets, but what's there is gorgeous to look at and listen to.- Compelling Gameplay. The 3PS/DotA mix works much better here than the original Monday Night Combat. Metagame and strategy are equally important to shooter skills and teamwork.Balance: (not really a pro or a con)- The game is ""fun"". It's not really set up for competitive play. There are lots of random elements, such as bacon drops. Damage is slightly randomized. For most things this can be forgiven, but when your Jackbots can spit Bacon right into the enemy base, things get extremely crazy.- The cash shop. This is why the game is free to play, and also why the game never made money. The ecomony, while robust on paper, is infinitely exploitable via Steam Trading. The game needs to retain players to sustain the cash flow and - for the reasons listed below - that never happened.- Super Blitz mode is a decent way to farm Combat Credits and work on your PvE skills, but it will MELT YOUR FACE. It's impossible to win by design. The ""goal"" is to keep your Moneyball alive for as many waves as you can. You will fail eventually. You can buy tokens to repair your Moneyball and turrets during the round, but that's sort of cheating.Cons:- Matchmaking is completely broken. There is no ""ranked queue"". Everybody above level 20 gets thrown into one gigantic free-for-all and it sucks for new players. Newbs don't have flexible product loadouts or any endorsements (runes) worth mentioning. Combined with being generally unskilled at either the shooter or DotA elements or (god help you) both, newbs consistently get rekt every game until they can scrape together a decent understanding of the game mechanics and unlock most of the pros and products.- The Practice Game mode doesn't work. At all.- The tutorial is terrible, to the point of being arguably non-existent. The Training Camp is essentially a museum that showcases the various gameplay-related objects and lets you practice interacting with them to an extent. The ability to practice against Jackbots and Chickey Cantor in nice, but there isn't any particularly useful information to be found here, apart from what everything looks like and what each thing supposedly does.What I would suggest after touring the Training Camp is running a few solo Custom Games so you can at least figure out how lane bots spawn and why killing them is important. Then close SMNC and watch a few gameplay videos. Perhaps uninstall entirely. Your call, really.Turbocross is the only mode with decent queue times at the moment, and that's due to the drop-in/drop-out nature of the mode. Turbocross is rebalanced to play like old MNC, minimizing the importance of the DotA elements. If you're REALLY DESPERATE for Overwatch, you might enjoy killing time here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game could have been great but it has too many flaws to keep me interested after I win the second of two Team Fortress 2 promotional items. The tutorial isn’t even remotely helpful, the learning curve is insane, and there’s no way to learn how to play the Pros (the playable characters) without having to play with other people, who are almost always far more experienced than you. Matchmaking is the only real way of playing, but the problem with it is that you are pretty much guaranteed to wind up against people far out of your league and paired with new players who are just as confused as you are. You should learn to play with friends. That way, you won’t have to worry about people with freakish experience and you can help each other win the hats for TF2.			",183,30,1,8,7,3,10

												Honestly, I do think the concept of this game is interesting and original, but the fact that litterally every single game MUST be played online, is just stupid. It really is. This really upsets me, as since you can't even play THE TUTORIAL without GOING ONLINE, this game is just impossible to learn. I still have no idea how to play the game, because when I try to PLAY THE TUTORIAL I can't even play it because no server was found. I've spent MORE TIME IN THE MENU TRYING TO PLAY THE TUTORIAL THAN ACTUALLY PLAYING THE GAME. I've played a single game.The way that you can't even PLAY SOLO just makes the game worse. Whenever I tried to play the game and somehow found a server, I would sit in the loading screen for a minuite only to be told that I couldn't connect to the host.Don't get hyped up though, as this game no longer recieves updates, so this game won't get ant better, ever.

												This game could have been great but it has too many flaws to keep me interested after I win the second of two Team Fortress 2 promotional items. The tutorial isn’t even remotely helpful, the learning curve is insane, and there’s no way to learn how to play the Pros (the playable characters) without having to play with other people, who are almost always far more experienced than you. Matchmaking is the only real way of playing, but the problem with it is that you are pretty much guaranteed to wind up against people far out of your league and paired with new players who are just as confused as you are. You should learn to play with friends. That way, you won’t have to worry about people with freakish experience and you can help each other win the hats for TF2.			",183,30,1,8,7,3,10

												Best third-person DOTA style game out there, in my opinion.  It is free, with a free hero rotation.  You pretty much only pay for cosmetics.It is very funny, with lots of wacky characters, odd moments, and homorous ""play-by-play"" commentary.  Overall, I love this games style.  But don't let its light-hearted presentation fool you, SMNC can be quite the challenging game.It is unfortunate that any further developement has seemed to seize.  Uber seems to have abandoned SMNC to work on their crowdfunded project, Planetary Annhialation.  Hopefully with that project nearing completion (or so I think it is) we will begin to see updates to the game soon.  As of this date (10-9-14) the last update to SMNC was released on March 18th, 2013 (well over a year ago).			",663,203,26,91,80,11,126

												Would be a good game if there were actually playersThere is no good tutorial or explanation on what is going on. It may seem very simple but the game is fairly complex with its MOBA Elements.Sadly the progressing in this game is very slow and especially if youre new you will be matched with players that have hundreds of hours of experience compared to you, since only the old experienced players are still seen here. Due to the lack of players only 1 Gamemode is ""playable"", you won't find a gamelobby/players when searching for any of the other ones, which is sad because this game had so much potential.Basically its a ghosttown, since the last update was 2013.

Special note for TF2 players: Just get in, do the achievements to get the hats and get out.Do NOT buy this game nor its original and not free counterpart, Monday Night Combat.The developer, Uber Entertainment, has abandoned support for this game for more than a year; not officially, mind you, but dead silence on anything from the company on the MNC/SMNC front as they are concentrating support on another game of theirs.While this is a fun, balanced 3rd person MOBA, mixing Team Fortress 2 and DOTA, as well as being one of the few games that is not only ACTUALLY hilarious, unlike other games where the jokes are funny once and never again, this has such an extensive library of well-written lines, it is sad that the developer decided to sabotage the game for a quick buck via the F2P & in-game store model.

												Essentially, SMNC is the perfect rip-off for tf2 due to the various classes they offer, and attempts of humor. Guns, blood, guns, chicks, more guns, weird red-headed (literally) dude who talks about weird♥♥♥♥♥♥ and of course more guns. Seems fun right? Only if you have high-processor, a gaming computer, and a something that will act as a blocker for anything off-screen that will slow your game. WHAT WAS THAT? SLOW? GAME? Yeah, it lags alot for most computers, and you usually have to adjust the options to the lower degrees and turn off optionable mechanics, which pretty ruins the game's look. It looks cool, what with all the tron-like outfits, space marine suits, and the colors available. The voices.........are ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. Some things are just random, though i can't say that's a complaint since it's heard in tf2 and borderlands 1 & 2 yet is very entertaining and likeable. But some of the things are just eeeeeeuuuuuuggggghhhhhhh. I don't want to really get into that. The music isn't really that enjoyable either for the majority of anyone who'll play it and not many people will since there's many other multiplayer shooters that are good like TF2, HL:DM, CS, Quake. Most people would play those games (or CoD ♥♥♥♥ing-whatever-edition) and usually a online shooter that works in thirdperson doesn't usually work very well, though many games have an option to select firstperson and thirdperson. In the end due to a lot of lag issues for pretty anyone, bad voices, and low amounts of true imagination and inspiration SMNC proves to everyone that maybe we need to really tighten the hose that's spraying multitudes of online shooters like Black Friday deals, and look at the shooters of old or the shooters of the newer gaming generation(s). Hell, maybe just play other genres of games (I'm kinda referring to CoD addicts right here), or you could just go outside, or (if you're old enough) go to a strip club! Actually I don't know about thew club, it'll probably be pretty dirty in ways you wouldn't enjoy and if you broguth a black light in there? ♥♥♥♥ me running. So there you go, SMNC is not worth the option-managing and playthroughs, not unless major updates come out that add new default looks, change some things around, and improve the quality of the game. Until then, we should just sing Kumbayah.			",32,2,1,0,1,1,0

The eye-opener for everyone:Okay guys, just let's be straigth now:This game has just has a lack of everything. The game itself is very onlogical, it doesn't look and feel familiar to as example TF2. It's a real pay to win game, if you have played this you really will know what pay to win means and never call a random game pay to win again. And what I just find very sad is that people spend lots of money to buy ingame goods and now the developers went this far that they have deleted everyone's inventory... Why? Its simple, they know that the game is dead. It is just a waste of time playing it guys, only a few people are playing this though, in a very boring gamemode. Don't think that you can download the game and later go play this. Almost all modes are dead and if you really want to play the one you like, the matchmaking servers will kill you because the download time of this game is just quicker than just playing a mode of the game. There is no real community. And everyone comes for the TF2 items. Listen up buddies, it's not worth it! Any idea how long it will take? Awkward controls, awkward third person, everything is just awkward in this game! So please guys don't play this nor get in touch with it, nor download it. Think about your children, your wife, the ones you care about! (This was just a little joke, don't take it very serious.) I also heard that the devs will maybe revive the game, or they are busy with another projects or maybe even a big one! If this is true, I will edit this review, but as how it's now I don't think this will happen... The last update of this game was in 2013 so yeah. Well, this was my review about this trashy game! I hope you enjoyed reading this!			",236,54,6,21,16,4,19

												This game is actually quite enjoyable. Theres just one issue and thats the players. As a new player IVe played over an hour and just couldnt enjoy it when all the dedicated fans keep calling you a noob and kicking your♥♥♥♥♥each time you respawn. The matchmaking is just non existant and its impossible to enjoy when you know you dont stand a chance. ",106,15,0,8,12,2,10

There's alot of things to be said..Gameplay Pros:Well, I enjoy the MOBA/Tower Defense style it has to it. Lots of scenery & colorful things to look at, easy to spot enemies, numerous buttons to press to activate certain things that'll slightly support your team! Unique classes as well, and to be honest, there is ALOT of Team Fortress 2 in there. But hey, that doesn't matter here. The gameplay is honestly easy to manage, very smooth.During PVP, its easy to get caught up in a fight when you're in a lane. But as I said earlier, it is extremely easy to spot enemies, they stand out so much - Which isn't always a bad thing.Gameplay Cons:Major M1 Attack bug, I'm sure this is known as well. If you fire a full round and it auto-reloads, the next round you fire will be non-existant until you have at-least 5 bullets left in the chamber. No damage will be done during that time, and it even does the firing animations/muzzle flashes!Horribly unbalanced! And for all the long-time players out there, you better agree on this too; Endorsements are a thing in this game - Basically gives you anything you can imagine, Attack Speed, Reload Speed, Attack Damage, Jump Height, Reduced Damage Received, the list goes on. Meaning, if you barely started this game and you enter a PVP match against someone who has at-least 40 hours in, you will get shredded.Soundtrack:I do enjoy the soundtrack in this game, just like the old Monday Night Combat it kept the genre of Rock. Otherwise it wouldn't of made sense..Although there is some conga music there..Voice Acting:The voice acting is good, could use some work here and there but for the most part, it's good! I grew tired of hearing the Annoucer's voice though, he's so damn annoying. If you lose a damn match, he'll jump on you for it. ""OHOHOH, HAHA. I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER BECAUSE THESE GUYS..SUCK!""Conclusion:I played this game to Level 20 for a Team Fortress 2 hat, as much as I LOVE Monday Night Combat - Super Monday Night Combat was meh.6.5/10 ",199,22,3,18,4,1,11

												This game is amazing. If you've tried getting into games like DOTA and League of Legends and found that it's just not for you, this might tickle your fancy. It's hard, but it's easier to get into than Dota or League. It's also a shooter, not an RTS. I recommend watching TotalBiscuit's ""WTF is... Super Monday Night Combat"" on YouTube to get a feel for it. The game itself also has many tips to get you going. And it's funny as HELL! All in all, DAN OUDA DAN!			",62,5,0,6,2,2,2

												Though Super Monday Night Combat was once a fantastic game (and still is, in terms of gameplay), it was mishandled by UberEntertainment to the point where the game has little to no playerbase and is no longer being updated by developers at all.In it's prime, it was being updated every week with a rotation of free Pros to play as, new maps and characters were being added frequently, and lots of cool cosmetic options were being added over time for every character.  The game itself has fantastic visual design, wonderful voice acting, and animation that's second to none.  It's full of character, highly competitive, and blends the best parts of MOBA/ARTS style games with the gameplay of a 3rd person shooter.  Super Monday Night Combat was awesome, but those days are past and the only remaining players are all angry, bitter, anti-community folks that have nothing else left to play.			",239,54,4,27,13,3,35

Sadly Uber abandoned the game by not dishing out updates to fix bugs and other glitches.

												Completely dead, but the only reason I'm playing this game is to get the two free TF2 hats, as soon as i get them, then I'm deleting the game, This game would be fun if the game was not dead, there is like a max of 20 people on thats it, and they are inviting people to join their games, that's how dead it is. I really want to give a ""yes"" recommendation but it's dead, laggy, not really fun at all. The only reason people should play this is to get the hats that's it.

												SMNC is best described as a fusion between Moba (DoTA) and FPS (TF2) genre's. Choose a Hero, join a team of 5, push creep wave's into enemies base, win game. First and foremost - this game is difficult - it's a full of FPS and if you start doing badly, by not killing enemy creeps etc, you will be lower level than enemy Hero's. And then they will eat your face. It's a game very high on teamwork. It's a game you have to sit down and give a while to learn, before it starts rewarding you with joyous victory. Stylistically, this game is one of the most lushest, comedic experiences I have come across, F2P or not. Each character is voiced differently, and the commentators who run throughout the game are both Awesome and incredibly varied. As a F2P game it should be noted that only vanity items cost any money, so feel free to give the game a go, if you feel that this is a genre you could enjoy. Highly, Highly recomended.

												I got level 5 but didn't get the free sniper hat. Is this a glitch? This game is extremely good, Until you meet the dickish host which keeps bragging in Blitz. It's also fun to go as assassin and start smoke bombing everyone and grappling and running away. But uh... I still want that sniper hat.			",63,6,0,3,5,0,0

												This game is dead. No devs support, no community support.There still are few players, but you have to wait a huge time for every single match. Among them, they usually miss communication and tactics, wandering alone trying to kill other pros, instead of working to reach the final objective.Very fun and well made, but the rest make the ship sink.At the time being, this game is useful only to get the 2 hats for TF2.

												This game should be played by everyone who enjoys games like DotA or HoN. It also provides a lot of enjoyment for anyone who likes TF2 fo shooters in general. However, if you choose to play SMNC take this advice to heart, PLAY EACH CLASS IN THE TRAINING ARENA FIRST! Get to know the game and you'll enjoy it all the more. If you don't it becomes a bit frustrating. All in all, totally worth your time.			",339,77,7,26,24,4,20

When I actaully was put in a server at level 1 I tried numourus times to kill at least ONE person  but I couldnt. There is no rank server you just are thrown into a server of random ranked people who could be Level 36 and you're just level 1 and have no idea what the heck you're doing.

If you expected anything than force donate, moba non-balanced game, with a lot of features you have to find out by yourself and about which game doesn't tell you anything than it's not for you. Just playing it to get the TF2 hats. Consider that this game is extremely non-friendly to new players and you will suck. A lot. Buy gunslinger or sniper and dominate the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of opposing team. Yup, some classes are just too OP. Also almost noone is playin this game so good luck finding a playable server. TIP: play on North America, EU and  Australia are completily non-playable. But the matches are pretty short, max 10-15 min and full of action. Also donate is pretty cheap. But still i won't recommend it. Unless you want 2 hats for TF 2. GL and HF.			",163,28,5,23,13,2,8

												For a rather small player base, it is still a regularly fun game to play for an hour or so. Though the only mdoe I have played is Super Blitz since I didn't find an interest in Team Deathmatch modes for this particular game.This game however does not get enough credit with it's corny lines and fast-paced action. Though I can only vouch for it's Super Blitz mode. Which pits 5 players of various player-chosen classes against hordes of robots while the announcer of Super MNC yells and cusses you out. So far I have only reached round 47, but the action is still incredibly fast and packed with bullets and explosives. A very fun play once in a while, otherwise it's very repetitive. Class customization allows you to boost your character how you want to, but not without it's side effects in the case of 'Endorsements'.I would say that if you have an interest in Team Fortress 2 or Gotham City Imposters, you should give this game a try as it's also Free-to-Play.

												The game is decent-good, depending on your stance on hero seige (DOTA-model) and arcade FPS game. The game is quite a fun play however for most matches the classes are unbalanced terribly, with certain characters like Megabeth being independent of all allies/combination and thus making her somewhat broken for public matches. That being said the gameplay itself is about killing the opposing teams moneyball, which can be equivalent to the TFT or TToL in DOTA, where you push down lanes and kill the enemy.  The graphics are quite good based on the artstyle and game engine, however despite being pretty it is still largely inferior to other class based FPS games like TF2. The unlock system also keeps most classes locked until you either a) spend a reasonable amount of money or b) waste a large amount of time trying to get said clases, even performing well in every match, it would take about 20h to get the first unlock (this includes the 2-4 min search times for games). Good game, not great.			",631,155,16,70,57,4,101

												Barely playable MOBA. The matchmaking mixes players regardless of their level, resulting in unbalanced matches. The game only gives you 6 characters to choose from, the rest of them is locked behind a paywall (You want to purchase this guy? 7000 gold. Good luck. You only get like 50 for a won match). Needless to say, premium characters are way stronger than basic ones. The netcode is terrible as well. Often grappling your opponent doesn't register and the game tends to jitter because of lag.The game is REALLY slow paced. Everyone does a low amount of damage and has a lot of health, including bots/turrets. As a result, the rounds tend to drag on forever.The nail to the coffin for that game is its terrible community. If you ask for advice, you're bound to be patronized and insulted by elitist players. SMNC is a waste of time. The only reason you'd want to play this atrocity is because of 2 free TF2 hats earned by completing achievements.			",445,107,13,37,31,8,41

												+ It's not hard to understand.+ It's easy to play, it's funny and the games are short (20-30min avg).- A game that's really fun to play, if you have some friends, else, it's almost impossible to find open games.- It takes incredibly long to save enough money to buy a ""special"" character, else $2.99.= It's more like CS1.6 than LoL (or DOTA).= Recomeneded, if you only want to have fun with some friends for an hour or two.= Hardcore gamers and ""pro-players"" are discouraged from playing this game.

												It's a great game, but it's dead now. Matchmaking is bad because of the lack of players. Actually, most of the problems are caused by a lack of players. In terms of gameplay, it can be a bit hard to get into. You either really love it or really hate it. Besides a few passive stat buffs, there is no item building or anything like that, so the character you pick is locked to a specific role. A role you have either have to play a lot or research a lot to play well.However, SMNC makes up for the lack of character variance with its gameplay variance. Giant chickens, lightning strikes, dangerous robots, all accompanied by the best announcers you will ever hear. You will never play a game like this anywhere else. Not for free. It can be annoying sometimes, but the good far outweighs the bad.			",265,29,4,16,7,1,13

												This is a game, that i recomend. But the issue is, how can i recomend none existant gameplay? me and my friend played this back when supercross took 15~30 minutes for games, and we even survived the jump from noobie games to general games reletivly with ease, still fighting well and enjoying ourselves. The mountin of issues of this game didnt phase us, we wanted to see more, and we couldnt wait to see it improve.The developers Failed us and many others on a hardcore level that can only be rivaled by the likes of duke nukem and half life 3. i come back after some time and check the reviews and i find out that the game has been forgotton all about in favor for a game that in early access cost £60. That bieng the case, Super monday night combat now has broken ingame chat from what i read, inaccessability to modes that require que's. and has not recieved any new content or updates for too long.The game's fans have been ignored, let down, and forgotton about, a game that had potential to soar with popularity, earn the developers bucket loads of bucks, and grant its fans hours upon hours of mindless and intense fun. These hosts are in the wrong industry. Super monday night combat is a game i would recomend, and recomend again. If it ever returns with decent hosts.			",91,2,2,7,7,1,18

												As many past reviewers have said, if you are looking for an active multiplayer experience this game is not for you, as the player pase consits of less than 10 average players. HOWEVER, if you can get a bunch of friends together, you can still play this game and as a F2P title, I guess this could workout.However, if you are like me, and have a lack of friends, this game can still be fun if you like wave like defence games, with a slight tower defence element (more like money ball defence.)There are 3 main modes: Turbo Cross (dead) Crossfire (dead) and Blitz (sorta dead but you can solo play this at least.) As I stated above, I have no had the chance to play the crossfire & turbocross modes much as they player base is minimal, however I have played 1 game of Turbo Cross, and as a noob I will try to review these game modes. Turbo Cross consists of a very moba/dota 2 style of play, with PVP elements. Waves of bots (vreeps) spawn and push certain lanes towards the enemys money ball. You as a player have to push with your bots, destry enemy bots, and assist your bots in taking down enemy turrets. The team wins by destroying the oppositions Money Ball. Blitz takes the bots and pits them in increasingly difficult waves against you, where you/ your team must defend your money ball for as long as you can. Pretty much all my playtime on SMNC and MNC are from Blitz mode, as I really do personally enjoy wave like survival games, and the tower defence elements are so small and simplistic that I am not turned away from this. In conclusion, if you want a game to play with your mates, then I suggest picking this game up as it's F2P, however that is pretty much all this game can offer multiplayer wise at this stage unfortunately.

The mechanics are totally original, and not there! great way to use their budget on more ""important"" things, like the announcer's voice lines! who doesent love the announcer? the item drop system is one of the many inspirational and innovative qualities the game offers! you can get these ball things that you can only open with special keys bought from the in game store!

The only thing you get is the worst game commentry I've ever heard attempting to tell you what is happening. The game also is near dead with only around 100 people playing during peak time. There is no support from the developers and this game is a total mess. Not recommended.			",167,164,12,25,83,5,34

												One of my favorite free to play titles!Do you enjoy class based shooters like Team Fortress 2 or Tribes Ascend? Do you enjoy MOBAs such as DOTA 2 or Smite etc? If you you said yes to either or both of those questions you owe it to yourself to give this game a shot. Right when you start they have an optional tutorial level where you can test out hero abilities, learn about the different AI controlled enemies (called creeps usually, bots in this case), and get a feel for the environmental weapons and events to help ease you into this hybrid style of game. Naturally a veteran of any of the previously mentioned games will want to skip over this, but you can leave the tutorial from the menu anytime so I recommend checking it out at least for the environment attacks.There is also a co-op horde mode which can be used for increased training before the real deal or as an alternative to regular matchmaking should you find high wait times* or have a more PvE minded team. It lacks the strategy of defending towers or spawning creeps, but is a good way to practice shooting, coordinating team abilities, or having absent minded fun. *Wait times are currently ridiculous in the 5v5 modes due to low player countSuper Crossfire is the name of the game's main entree. You only have two lanes and one jungle so team fights happen often and are never far away from you. One lane usually has 2 people and the other has 3, causing one of the lanes to be constantly pushed and therefore in need of defending. Alternatively you can have a fifth man roam between the lanes seeking the enemy roamer or hiding for surprise attacks. In the middle of all the fighting and pushing, events are constantly occurring in the jungle like a free money spawning ""enemy"", a Roshan like boss that gives a buff on defeat, a creep wiping laser and more. This gives the game a perpetual feeling of motion and speed never allowing boredom.There is another game mode which takes the premise of Super Crossfire and makes it more shooter-esque. Damage is increased, speed is increased, turret shields do NOT come back, health regen changes from DOTA-like to Halo-like, and other changes to creeps and players. This mode is great if you want a faster match or are less fond of the strategy layer.In Short:PROS+ Great Hero Variety+ Multiple Maps+ Multiple Modes+ Map Events+ Perfect Balance of Action and Strategy+ Excellent Humor with Top-Notch Voice Acting+ Amazing Art Style and GraphicsCONS- Long Matchmaking/No playerbase - game abandoned by devs. (The developers would like to revive it though)- What's left of the players are the most toxic of the community- No new content planned (heroes, maps, etc.) again due to abandonment- Matchmaking isn't separated by skill so new players can get destroyed by long time playersIf you can get 4 friends to try it with you a great game is waiting to be discovered even if you stick to the horde mode. If you can find 9 friends you've eliminated virtually all of the cons to this game.9.5/10			",452,69,1,51,15,3,41

The player base is primarily composed of hardcore players that spent hundreds of thousands of hours playing Monday Night Combat, as well as people that spend too much time playing MOBAs as well.Essentially you have a toxic envoirment for any new players; no one will ""teach"" you how to play and expect you to know how everything works from the get-go. The mechanics and even the controls aren't explained to you - I had to be told at least THREE DEGREES from friends that knew how to play that there was even a button to assign skill points!Just as well, there is no tutorial system whatsoever, there isn't a balance between setting players up that have barely started playing versus those who have hundreds of games under their belts, and all in all they seek to make the game less fun for newbies like me.If this gets out of beta safely it will be a marvel.

												NOTE: Game currently has little players and some of them are just cheating... Who ♥♥♥♥ing cheats in an almost dead game? Jeez, some people... Get a life.Best MOBA ever. The objective of the game is to push your bots (minions) to the opposing team's base center (called ""moneyball""), by destroying their defensive turrets (note that only bots can remove the turrets' shield). Only the bots can bring down the moneyball so you can shoot it. Killing the opposing players is good, but keep in mind it is not the objective of the game. I've seen teams with a lot of kills lose the game because they forgot to push their bots. This is not CoD ;)This game is so fun and underrrated I could cry. Since I discovered it I cannot stop playing it. It has a good dose of humour, gameplay is very good, player base is hilarious (don't take anyone too seriously), balanced matches are very intense. Game relies a lot on teamplay, although very good players can tip the balance. Sadly too few players, but usually you can find turbocross matches, although these matches can be a little too harsh for newbies sometimes, as usual players are already somewhat experienced.Some bugs appear from time to time, but nothing really annoying. Cheaters sometimes appear to ruin the match. These sad little kids with no life or skill have nothing better to do than cheat in an almost dead game. They think they're so 1337 because they can cheat. My main strategy in these cases is just leaving the match, not worth your anger. But don't confuse good players with cheaters ;)Shame on Ubersoft for not caring about this game anymore. PS: if you're new please don't pick assassin, it's not a good class for beginners. Good players♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you with assassin doesn't mean you can play her as well as they do. And btw cloaking is NOT invisibility.			",277,50,9,34,61,4,71

												If you've got money to spend in this game go ahead (or be smart and dont), otherwise you will be put in the newb team and loose most games, just like in real life.Also, the game has some exploits that the vets take constant advantage. As all broken games that has people playing it, they will try to defend it and that's normal.The game could be easily fixed, they just needed to put newbs playing agains newbs and vets vs vets but that wont happen because that would implicate that people that bought stuff wouldnt get that rush from killing low level players.Go play Lol, Dota or the new Heroes of the Storm.If you are planning of buying stuff just don't, send me the money instead I will read you a bed time story every night through skype or send you some candy. Trust me it will be hundred times better.			",6,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Anti-recommendation.This game is completely inaccessable for new players in any way, shape or form. The player base is primarily composed of hardcore players that spent hundreds of thousands of hours playing Monday Night Combat, as well as people that spend too much time playing MOBAs as well.Essentially you have a toxic envoirment for any new players; no one will ""teach"" you how to play and expect you to know how everything works from the get-go. The mechanics and even the controls aren't explained to you - I had to be told at least THREE DEGREES from friends that knew how to play that there was even a button to assign skill points!Just as well, there is no tutorial system whatsoever, there isn't a balance between setting players up that have barely started playing versus those who have hundreds of games under their belts, and all in all they seek to make the game less fun for newbies like me.If this gets out of beta safely it will be a marvel.

												There's a reason I only played ten hours. Most people that I knew got turned off after one and a half. Broken matchmaking systems, the lack of dev support, waiting for literally up to ONE AND A HALF HOURS or so for either L0Z0rThaP3ngu1nofDOOM, xXxDeath_MasterxXx, or juan.santos2005 to join in, the fact that the top guide nowadays is made specifically to get people in and out as fast as possible, and the fact that the majority of the 40 people still playing this game have turned into a toxic mess rivaling low tier competitive LoL or DOTA just makes it a awful game to be on. The hat's you get from this game for TF2 look bad, and the cosmetics you get in this game are overpriced to oblivion AND look bad. If the Mann Co. Store from TF2 and EA's cosmetic DLC system had a baby, it would be the Uber store, which currently in a eternal sale because of how little it's been used. If you like old memes and wasting cash, look no further.Along with ugly costumes, it has honestly one of the worst class buying systems out there. Heroes of the Storm got nothing on this. Basic characters, like stronger tanks or longer range characters, have to be unlocked with hard earned THOUSANDS of coins (The TANK class, for example, needs 4500 coins). You only get like 40 coins per win/loss. This is a problem, and often leads to new players get destroyed by older, richer, and more class unlocked players.	On the bright side of this mess, the combat's in SMNC is alright. With the 5 classes you get unlocked, out of the game's unlockable 17, being fun to use when you finally do good (rarely), and offer different playstyles which spices up the game a bit. Blitz is pretty cool as well, a Tower Defense sort of deal against the robots that gives lots of XP on completion. Use this if your grinding for that last TF2 hat, you're going to need that last boost after spending time during the dead hours of the game.In short, with a tiny community practically rivaling DOTA/LoL levels of toxicity, overpriced and ugly cosmetics and hero unlocks, ridiculous grinding for ugly rewards, and a horrendous amount of waiting, even for a dead game, the combat and game modes can't save this from not getting a recommendation.

Name: Super Monday Night CombatVariations: Super MNCDeveloper: Uber EntertainmentDate: 2012Relationships: Sequel To ""Monday Night Combat"" (2010)Genre: MOBA, TPSOrientation: MultiplayerPopulation: Few Who SurvivedPerspective: 3D - Third-PersonTimeflow: Match-Based, Real-TimeSkills: FingersSetting: FuturisticStyle: -Tags: Complicated, No Campaign, No Story, No Tutorial, Noob Unfriendly, RPG ElementsModel: F2PContent: MicrotransactionsPlatforms: PCReview: Futuristic TPS MOBA game with complicated rules and few game modes, including typical lanes-towers-nexus-5v5, defend-nexus-from-waves and something else I couldn't try. Why? Simply no players, miss Queue is just lost and doesn't know what is she supposed to do with these 10 people online. All games are created as custom games with no exceptions, and invitations are sent through chat.	There is no tutorial, just bulsh*t youtube video that says 3 words about each thing in the game, leaving you wondering about 80% things. That's how developers respect new players. Not even all controls are explained (and you can not change controls as far as I know - I played few training games and 1 multiplayer before someone finally explained me how to switch weapons, Jesus.	Rules are so complex that after watching this 7 minute video you still won't know anything. Go to Practice mode, and spend good 30 minutes running around the map clicking on green rays (about 20 of them if not more) - then tutorial voice will tell you information about different things in game. But still, even if you manage to remember all this sh*t, don't expect knowing everything about the game.	There are hero classes (heroes are called 'pros' here), minion types each with weaknesses and advantages, turret types, level ups and abilities (usable or toggle), different jungle mobs, super-powa self-buff, different vendor machines on map selling stats and buffs, purchasable jump pads, deploying minions, map objectives like 'annihilator' that destroys all enemies when used, items providing unique bonuses and more - I don't remember everything honestly.	Visually game looks nice - futuristic cityscape arenas in sport style, minions looking like droids of different shapes and sizes, and characters looking slightly close to Team Fortress 2 guys but less comic. And of course cosmetic things you can buy make it even more beautiful. But.. there is no point doing so. Game is so dead you can't even try it.	I never tried original B2P Monday Night Combat, but I'm afraid that if Super MNC is so dead than orinal is nothing but a ghost town...Class: III - Dead BreadVerdict: NoReviewed: 1.11.2016Approach: Steam - PCTime: An HourDeeds:  1 Multiplayer Match Played (Don't laugh great achievement in such conditions) ",820,308,34,133,103,18,157

												Definitely the best game in its category. We all truly miss playing it.✓ Mix of first person shooter and strategy arena team play ✓ Excellent graphics and map design, decent character design too✓ Good game mechanics, well balanced✓ A vibrant and joyful atmosphere✓ Overall great voice acting (except for the newer Wascot voice which is lame)✘ No Linux support✘ Match-making didn't work very well✘ Dead player-base as of 2014.

												This was an extremely fun game and a shame that I got into it as late as I did.  I wish Valve would take it over to pump new life into it.   I think most TF2 fans could get into this as an alternative go to fast paced multiplayer game if it had a new following.Come to think of it... they could probably do a Team Fortress themed MOBA.

												This game is not that of a good game, though it would have been good, but I feel like it is very unbalanced, sometimes I can't even shoot a single bullet or rocket and get insta killed by a guy of same level as me coming out of nowhere, the matchmaking doesn't put you with people of same level as you, it put you with people lower or higher level that are extremely higher skilled than you which makes it feel unfair, you can get surprise gift that gives you random cosmetic and boxes that you have to buy the damn key for opening it, at least the good point of the surprise gift after a won round is the chance of free cosmetic, but that's it I find of good, otherwise you need to play like 50 to 70 games to unlock a single character, if you want to buy some better boost it will require you to do like a 100 and more games against unballanced characters and unfair high level players put in your matchmaking.

												The only reason anyone in their right mind would play this game is because of the tf2 hats you get. I only played one game, and I think I'll die before I get the level 20 hat. Oh well. Basically, I have no fun playing it, and it takes 10 minutes to find a match. And when you are in game, you realize how lazy the developer is. The game looks like a bad copy of loadout. Or a Team Fortress 2 wannabe. When you are done with the game, it is one of the biggest reliefs you get in gaming as now you know you dont have to play this crap for the next minute. You get a prize with incredibly annoying music at the end of a round, and its usually something useless that you will never use. Not to mention, when I am looking through the people online, its the SAME 20 people from yesterday evening that was online. Oh, and don't even get me STARTED with the announcer. At first I thought he was the only good thing they did to this game, but later figured out I had to mute the announcers voice to prevent my ears from bleeding.Final Summary: Puts the UNREAL engine to shame with it's lazy developers and annoying announcements. 1/10 Would NEVER play again after getting the hats.

												Well done, Ubi - you took a great xbox 360 game and concept and ran it into the ground with DRM, mandatory registration and even requiring the practice mode to be online. The pay to play (and win concepts) are so transparently there, it's laughable. I'd recommend this as a skip - if you want a halfway decent moba / turret game, go with battleborn or dungeon defenders.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sadly, since the desertion of the devs, the multiplayer community has died for this game. Like many other dead games, the only people that are playing are hyper-newbs and hyper-nerds. This was an awesome game back in the early '10s, but it's nearly completely unplayable without enough users to fill a match.			",228,18,4,29,14,2,13

												I feel like I spent more time in lobbies waiting to join than I spent actually playing the game. The game itself tries to achieve some kind of whacky sporty college bro vibe, but is just a ho-hum MOBA in general.My recommendation? Play until you get the achievement for the TF2 pyro hat and then uninstall.2/10 would not play any day of the week (except to get a free hat).			",507,127,7,26,23,2,37

												This game was horrible with weird character design, sometimes laggy, many bugs like when respawn immediately my weapons have 0 ammo and can't reload or fire, often crash and stopped working.For the new player I think this game was hard to understand and will be easily dominated by other player.but he good things are leveling agents are so fast, so the player who just want TF2 hat will be easily to obtain it, like me.I'm playing it just to get the items, and enough.

												I really hope this game dies. That sounds horrible but the game is so monotonous you do the same thing in 3 different ways over and over. It really bugs me that its a pay to win to. There are people who wasted $20 on this game and instantly kill you repeatedly. I mean at first its fun, then when you reach level 5 it gets a little boring, then at level 10 you understand why people dont play the game and respect it, then at level 15 you get really bored of the game, either quitting it or pushing through to get the stupid hat, and at level 20, where I am, YOU JUST HATE THE GAME AND WANT IT TO DIE AFTER IT GIVES YOU THE HAT THAT TURNS OUT TO BE WORTHLESS.

												gameplay is good but the one most annoying thing is how you cant even play -.-Firstly, there is no offline play, secondly, its really unfair how a new player can be really unbalanced, since you can level up, and if you join mid match, you get a certain amount of levels, so you might be level 6, and the rest level 10, so its kinda dumb and unfair. Thirdly, the proccesss of joining a game. you have to invite people individually, and just ♥♥♥♥ing spam them with invites, but they can leave at any time which is the worst. why the ♥♥♥♥ can you not just ♥♥♥♥ing make a proper quick play option -.-thats literally the main reason i dont recommend this, because less gameplay, more waiting for some players to join. unless youre here only to get the 2 hats in tf2, it will be a hard process unless there will be a lot of people in the list that you can invite, but you can sometimes only get 11 people which wont even join.

												super monday night combat was a awsome looking game but when i got in omg it was hard. Well for one thing it took forever to find a match and some of the gamemodes are dead. When i finaly got into a match i began to play but after maybe 2 minutes they were telling me to get out i didnt respond back and the mechanics were a little diffrent from some games so i was confused for a bit. The gameplay was intresting for awhile then it got slowly degrading and boring. This game looks good no doubt about that but the lack of a community and veteran players hating noobies just draws away from the game. In a 1 to 10 score i give it a 4/10 the gameplay is not bad but a little confusing at first and second is the community being dead with whats left of it not completly willing to let new players in.

												Another attempted DotA ripoff but missing about half the game's features. You level up, upgrade skills, push lanes, and fight Roshan, but there's no item shops, TP scrolls, counterpicking, etc. The most disappointing part for me is the lack of pros (heroes); 16 pros divided between 5 classes and 6 free per rotation means a lot of mirror matches.It has some unique concepts and is fun for casual play, but I don't really see myself playing this after a month or so since it has so many problems. Lack of pros, leavers going unpunished, non-existent matchmaking, lack of maps (5 maps & average match is 15 mins), and the ridiculous cash shop kill this game's staying power.

												Well. I went to download this game because it looked alright, but truth is, it is almost the worst game I have ever played. There are NO players, the game is put together more like a tf2 clone than a MOBA, and the tutorial is worse than not having on at all.This sums up my experience: Wait 15 minutes for a match, then someone is global chat FINALLY responds to me, telling me people ONLY PLAY TURBOCROSS. So I queued up, got into a game, and proceded to get rekt. I asked for some helpful hints, and all I got was someone calling me a noob. Duh, 1st game.Aside for the face that there are literally 6 people on at one point, they are very toxic. The fact that this game even has the audacity to ask for my money makes me extremely upset. I waited a half hour to download this, and played for an hour. This is time I will never get back.Take my word for it, this is a horrible game, and you will only waste your time. Get Dota/Smite/Lol/Strife/Heroes of the Storm instead.			",137,14,0,8,6,0,13

When it was active it was pretty solid and fun. Now, the servers hardly work, at one point you couldn't even log into the servers.

												Fun? Yes.  Funny? Yes.  Enjoyable with friends? Yes.  This is the funnest MOBA I have played.  The only problem is the game has been left to rot with some joining issues, loading issues, and crashes.  Although, in saying that, I haven't played this game in a while so everything could have changed for better... These issues being fixed, or for worse... It is a waste land.  I hope it isn't the latter of the two.			",97,9,0,8,10,0,17

												I do NOT reccomend this game to anyone who wants a good Free-To-Play shooter. I got this game because it seemed nice and also for the Team Fortress 2 hats. It seemed ok at first, then I realized the game seems like a ghost town in a sense that it seems like not many people play this game, also it's major problem is that it's Pay-To-Win, I've played multiple times and those that payed for the virtual goods had a much bigger advantage than I did, also after every match you earn coins and XP. If your F2P then sorry you don't get too many coins. If you want a good F2P shooter that ISN'T P2W, Team fortress 2 or Planetside 2 are much more viable options.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can tell by how I have no new hours in it!Seriously though, if it weren't for the horrible, toxic, pulsating mass of subhuman pus of a community; and if the developer didn't power♥♥♥♥ the game into oblivion, it would be a good game!Unfortunately the community is a horrible, toxic, pulsating mass of subhuman pus, and the developers did indeed power♥♥♥♥ the game into oblivion.  Granted, these developers do that to every game they touch, which is a real bummer.But hey, it's free to play, check it yourself!			",271,23,6,43,17,6,35

												Started playing, played one game, waitied an hour trying to find another. ♥♥♥♥ing worthless.Then there's the problem that the UI doesn't scale, everyhting UI based looks like it was scaled for an old CRT montor resolution.The control scheme is total♥♥♥♥♥♥ Going from something like Borderlands or Dota that has that♥♥♥♥♥♥on lockdown to this is a ♥♥♥♥ing headache. Expect to waste your abilities constantly as you try tro do something as simple as sprint. Which you can't do, because that would require too much work from the devs.So, obviously while waiting in queue I did a bit of research, and it turns out that all 33 patches lost money, so the dev abandoned it. Its literally the definition of a dead game. Some poor guy tried to make patches for it himself with the sanction of Uber, he said that the problems are so extensive, they can't be fixed without an overhaul, which he isn't going to do in his spare time, because in the f2p game where they are still charging you for clothes, they can't possibly give any money to this lone guy who is obviously their biggest supporter.Its like someone had an idea to make a freemium game, and copy everything possible from Valve, down to the treasure chests and keys, and innovate as little as possible. If you want this style of game, Sanctum is better, Dota 2 is the great satan in the room that they tried to copy some of the MOBA elements from and TF2 is right over there, and Overwatch which promises to have at least a properly scaled and logical UI instead of the trash in this game.It really really sucks guys.

												Super MNC is great fun (despite some elements that can feel cheap or frustrating). The blend of shooter and MOBA feels fresh and unique, and combined with the over-the-top combat-sports world created by Uber, Super MNC is a blast to play. You may even be tempted to spend some money on it, given how awesome some of the costumes and taunts are (do yourself a favour and look up the Gunslinger's Judge Dredd uniform and Captain Spark's Action Hero taunt).Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/09/super-mnc.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												Fun? Yes.  Funny? Yes.  Enjoyable with friends? Yes.  This is the funnest MOBA I have played.  The only problem is the game has been left to rot with some joining issues, loading issues, and crashes.  Although, in saying that, I haven't played this game in a while so everything could have changed for better... These issues being fixed, or for worse... It is a waste land.  I hope it isn't the latter of the two.			",97,9,0,8,10,0,17

												i was hoping that SUPER MNC would be the succesor of MNC..however.. both these games are dead... barely any players, and a lot of cheating/hacking going on around in there..too bad, at launch the original game was a big hit.. now its just a dieng game, it can take up to 15 and beyond to find a good match , and chances are high you end up against some overfarmed or cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that never let you leave the spawnroom..all in all, this game could have been great, but was destroyed by its cheating community and the lack of interest to do anything about that by the devs of the game wich are more interested in managing their useless item sales in the ingame store..

												I do NOT reccomend this game to anyone who wants a good Free-To-Play shooter. I got this game because it seemed nice and also for the Team Fortress 2 hats. It seemed ok at first, then I realized the game seems like a ghost town in a sense that it seems like not many people play this game, also it's major problem is that it's Pay-To-Win, I've played multiple times and those that payed for the virtual goods had a much bigger advantage than I did, also after every match you earn coins and XP. If your F2P then sorry you don't get too many coins. If you want a good F2P shooter that ISN'T P2W, Team fortress 2 or Planetside 2 are much more viable options.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The only problem is the game has been left to rot with some joining issues, loading issues, and crashes.  Although, in saying that, I haven't played this game in a while so everything could have changed for better... These issues being fixed, or for worse... It is a waste land.  I hope it isn't the latter of the two.			",97,9,0,8,10,0,17

												Super MNC is a fun game.For me its got the good from Dota 2 and TF2,This is a 5 vs 5 gameplay witch is a really balanced lane up, in Super MNC You got 2 lanes and a jungle, allmost like in Dota 2 + there is a ""money ball"" that you need to destroy, just like in dota you lvl up your ""hero"" only in that game, the TF2 part here is 1.There is alot of hats,sets for the ""heros""2.In Super MNC there need to be team work, you need to team up with your team mates and do every thing togetor.The DOTA 2 part here is:1. etch ""Hero"" have skills, you lvl up your skills whan you lvl up your ""hero""2.You get coins if you kill an enemy robot or a hero,with that gold you can buy more bots on your lane or buff up your hero.3.In Dota 2 there are this units that called ""creeps"", In Super MNC you have units that are robots, buy killing the enemy robots you get cois (in DOTA 2 its gold).Finel Thing, this game is really good, but no one plays it, just go to your Friends that play TF2 and say ""hey if you play this game you will get cool hats (you really will) for TF2) and just play for 20H and ask your self, do you mind playing this game again?

												I'm not sure what state this game is currently but as an avid supporter of both MNCs I do recommend giving it a try. The community is quite polarised, you will meet very helpful beings who want to have fun mixed with griefers who cheese turrets with the assassin and taunt in chat. The gameplay is honestly fantastic, this was my main game for a while, give it a try. A warning though, the learning curve is very steep and you will run into some very good players on your journey.			",39,0,1,1,2,0,7

												I played this game when it first came out.  The game itself is quite a bit of fun.  But unfortunately two things kill it.  The absolutely horrible player base.  Little kids who do nothing but yell at each other.  One day maybe games will require age restrictions to play and things will improve.  The second thing is no match making.  You get people who played for literally a year playing with people who just started today lol.  That killed it.  The game is dead.  If you are looking for a 3rd person moba try smite, its an actual moba.			",50,17,0,16,7,2,14

												While the concept of this game might be good, it is a bit badly done.* Some things need real rebalancing. For example:- You can grab enemies in melee range and perform a cool animation which makes them lose a chunk of HP. Sounds neat, right? While doing that, everyone can shoot the two players and the poor victim can be grabbed afterwards. There are issues with who grabs who first and in the end of the animation, the victim gets kicked forward, so he can fall into a pit & die. You can make it worse by getting a product, which sets anyone who you grapple / grapples you on fire.- There is a class skill in the game that spams your screen with colorful, spinning ads (from the game, not actual ones) while also covering your HP which is in the upper middle of the screen.- Some classes have trap skills. Those can't be destroyed by enemy team as far as I know.- Some of the items, skills deal either terribly little damage or way too much.- Some bots have pretty huge AoE attacks that throw you back. Often out of the field. Respawn time takes up to 40 seconds later in the game.* The game is a bit dead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												High skill gaps, overpowered everything. No chance of winning unless you've been playing for a long time. High levels have tons of extra advantages and do nothing but steam roll everyone. Your damage is like 4 hp per shot while their damage is like 1/3 of your health. Even when you play safe, you have no chance of even getting a kill while you can't even leave your spawn. The shooting is no better than mediocre and the MOBA elements do not satisfy anyone.I thought this game being broken and unbalanced were just beta problems, but even now the game is horrendous.0/100			",645,102,42,87,88,11,104

												i  m not sure what to write here but here a recipe of pancakeIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												Pretty much is similar to Tf2 with different people, the game is more for getting free Tf2 hats or If you don't have a lot of games, It can be for that too because It's free.			",137,31,1,18,2,3,9

												It's way more complicated than than regular Monday Night Combat, and not in a good way(Looks like there's a lot of pay2win charecters and weapons). Also hardly anyone plays this anymore, because I couldn't even find enough people to start a game so I only played the tutorial. They should have just made Monday Night Combat 2 and released it for 15-20 dollars, not this pay2win trash that only 10 people still play. I'll just keep playing regular Monday Night Combat on Xbox 360, at least 11 people still play that and you can usually find find a full game during peak hours.			",113,10,0,23,13,0,11

Product received for free
												Super Monday Night Combat, aka SMNC. Where did we go so wrong?Oh, I know where.The game died out some time ago, which is quite aggrovating. I only played this for the free TF2 hats (glad I got the Flamingo Kid), but I also wanted a game to play for a long time. This obviously wasn't my first choice. You got people sending random game invites, which are quite understandable, because the game's become a ghost town. The skill levels are heavily imbalanced, with newbies facing off against the P2Ps and the Higher-Ups/Vets.Don't download/install this game, unless you want to be in the game of lost hopes.

												SMNC is a Dota game, you play it from the over the shoulder perspective... It sounds nice, like MNC before it, but sadly it falls far short of being a worthwhile experience. It's Pay to Win, the Endorsments which players can gain can alter your stats to a sufficient degree to make you more powerful by a noticable margin when compared to an actual Free to Play user.If that was all, it wouldn't be so bad, but the matchmaking system is complete garbage, quite unreliable, it doesn't even make use of the statistical data Uber obviously have to form balanced teams.There is no real reward for playing through to the end of a game, and absolutely no consequence to those who leave a game early.If you want Dota but with better controls, you're almost there - but all the framework around it is too badly done.It's just not worth playing past getting the first achivement to get the Sniper hat for TF2, the Pyro one looks like♥♥♥♥♥anyway.Trades only work if you waste money in the store.

												Super Monday Night Combat is an innovative, third-person arena shooter.Pros: Graphics, Sound, Controls, GameplayCons: CommunityFrom the sleek Assassin to the hulking Jackbot, the graphics look superb. The music and sound mesh well with the gameplay, with the roaring crowd, gunfire, and cheeky advertisements. A controller or a keyboard and mouse work very well. Finally and above all else, Super Monday Night Combat is simply fun, standing out among numerous FPS clones and DotA-style mobas with unique and challenging mechanics.However, one simple flaw serves to demolish all fun to be had: the community has dwindled, leaving Super MNC's pick-up-and-play style a thing of the past.4/10 ",107,8,0,12,6,1,2

												SMNC is a Dota game, you play it from the over the shoulder perspective... It sounds nice, like MNC before it, but sadly it falls far short of being a worthwhile experience. It's Pay to Win, the Endorsments which players can gain can alter your stats to a sufficient degree to make you more powerful by a noticable margin when compared to an actual Free to Play user.If that was all, it wouldn't be so bad, but the matchmaking system is complete garbage, quite unreliable, it doesn't even make use of the statistical data Uber obviously have to form balanced teams.There is no real reward for playing through to the end of a game, and absolutely no consequence to those who leave a game early.If you want Dota but with better controls, you're almost there - but all the framework around it is too badly done.It's just not worth playing past getting the first achivement to get the Sniper hat for TF2, the Pyro one looks like♥♥♥♥♥anyway.Trades only work if you waste money in the store.

												Super MNC is unfortunately, a big floop. Sure, it's the free-to-play version of a great multiplayer game, but when you realise how much is restricted from you because of the f2p model, how much bugs and more are there that STILL HAVEN'T BEEN FIXED, and the fact that the developers abandoned the game is something to tell that this is a bad game.Long story short: The game is dead. Waste of space. 2 Comets out of 10 It had great potential, but just failed to use it.			",320,72,5,32,10,3,19

												Game is dead. :( Last update/news on they site ""03/15/2013. "". So sad, becouse game is really fun, and i enjoed a lot when i played it. Now in Quote u need to wait ~20 min to play with someone. And mostly someone got afk. And there are some bug. U can saw how much ppl are online not in left corner where write over 500 or 1000. But how much ppl sit on chat (10 people). - so that why hard to play with someone.So, when i played long time ago - i really enjoed. Uberent got good idea about game but they leave this project. And now we got a lot of bugs and unbalanced heroes. If uberent resume the project i will back (like most of players i hope)			",273,42,15,27,17,1,42

												Added for tf2 cosmetic. Attemped to play for tf2 cosmetic. Didn't make it past level 2. The game is dead, boring, and has awkward controls. It also has a very weird concept, mixing TF2 with League of Legends which is confusing. If you add for the tf2 cosmetics, it's not worth it at this point. At most I saaw about 300 (if even that) people online in the game so you most likely wont even find a match within 5 minutes. damnit my dog just puked let me clean it up. Anyway, bad and boring game, buy Overwatch or buy some cosmetics that look mildly adequate if you're one of those plebs that hates all TF2 ""clones"".10/10 ♥♥♥♥ soldier			",59,2,0,12,2,1,7

												What can I say?This game was plagued from the very start of it's life.Servers are horrible, classes are horribly balanced, people are cancer in the chats.There's only 40 people on the NA server ever since the game had started, and yes, we can get put together quicker, but it still takes 12 minutes for two pre-made parties to match up.The TF2 hats are not worth it. Want good TF2 hats? Get Poker Night at the Inventory 1 and 2.

												OK don't get me wrong here, but this is rubbish! It would be great, if you could get into a match. The fact that the accounts system is totally messed up doesn't really help either. Plus, choosing and setting up a class for the first time takes 20 mins! I spent quite a while on this and never got into a match!			",131,8,1,8,19,3,9

												The only reason I'm playing this game is for the Pyro hat. I only have this much time in because of it.I honestly hate this game. The voice acting, the gameplay, the graphics, the music... everything. Even the loading screens. Okay, now I understand some people love it, and the creators put a lot of work into it. You go, creators. HOWEVER, that does not change my recommendation or my opinion. This game tries to be new and revolutionary, and the concept isn't bad, but the execution sucked. If you think you might like this game for what it is instead of a way to get two hats, hear me out. I thought I was going to enjoy it too. But this is just... Not enjoyable. It's boring, the music and sound effects are annoying, and don't get me started with the announcer. I'm just chugging through it because the pyro hat is really friggin awesome.			",99,13,1,5,5,0,1

												This game looks super cool! Although the moment you get in you start to notice a pay to win trend. I don't mean a little pay to win I mean ALOT of pay to win. 2/3 of the classes have to be bought 95% of the guns have to be purchased it just goes on and on. If you want a free game that you end up spending over $100 go ahead but for other people don't play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got this game for the Sniper and Pyro hatsI only managed to bare getting the Sniper hat which I ended up crafting and got a melted candle for my Pyro's head which I like more than this game. 2 hours... Is how long it took me to get to the level needed for the Sniper hat...IMAGINE HOW MANY HOURS IT'D TAKE TO GET THE BLOODY PYRO HAT!    It's a boring and annoying FPS that tries TOO MUCH to be like TF2, Maybe Loudout, and other FPS GEMS.  The ""Jokes"" Aren't funny at all, the announcers have like 10 lines and it gets annoying after dying to an over powered turret for the 100th time. I got this game hoping for it to be a fun break for TF2. It wasn't, it was repeditive and BORING! The ""Classes"" The Spy, Soldier, Sniper, Medic, and Heavy are all BORING to play!!! THE SPY IS USELESS THE SOLDIER DOES NO DAMAGE THE SNIPER SNIPERS THE MEDIC HEALS ONE PERSON AND THE HEAVY IS A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You tried TOO HARD to rip off TF2 mate. Not worth the disk space I WASTED on this♥♥♥♥♥♥fest of a fps/TPS (Third person shooter) Jesus Star Wars: Battlefront 2 is better than this. Wait, it's actually GOOD! Maybe up there with TF2. Listen, you want a good F2P FPS? Get TF2, maybe Loadout, how about Blacklight? ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN THIS (Maybe not Combat Arms) Ya know what... Get L4D2 that's also damn good. Don't waste DISK SPACE ON THIS LIKE I DID! IT'S NOT WORTH IT EVEN FOR THE DAMNED ♥♥♥♥♥♥ HATS!Do your self a favor and get a good game before your brian melts and your ears bleed from this game's mind melting BORING REPEDITIVE GAMEPLAY AND THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ANNOUNCER RIP OFF VOICES!DO US ALL A FAVOR AND STEP AND SPIT ON THIS GAME'S GRAVE!

												Super Monday Night Combat is a class-based, free-to-play third-person multiplayer shooter.The game is a televised futuristic death-sport that has two teams of five fighting each other in hopes of escorting bots to the enemies’ base and destroying their coin-filled moneyball. Doing this will require teamwork, upgrading your players, protecting your team’s bots and destroying the enemy’s turrets. During play, you will level up and are allowed to spend your points on upgrading your three abilities or your defense and attack power. You will also gain money for purchasing stat boosters, jump pads to reach higher places and waves of bots to send at your opponents. After a game is over, your profile will gain experience points.Super Monday Night Combat is well worth your time if you are looking for a free shooter. It has a large variety of characters, great maps and is not a pay to win game.Sounds 5/10Graphics 4/10Gameplay 6/10Atmosphere 6/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1592,618,71,238,229,30,272

												I admit it, I only play it for the TF2 hats, even though I quite like it.It is a cool TPS game with some defense elements (just play Blitz mode to find out), and most classes are easy to play, especially the rocket launcher girl.HOWEVER:-Last update was a year ago. Seriously? -You can barely find any players. Everyday you only see about 400 players-Only 4 game modes, and one of them is just a practice mode-More P2W than NFS World and APB combined! I mean, 15 bucks for a damn gun?!?!?It is a good game, but the developers didn't give a f*** about it for a very long time and it died, just like that stupid PC Gamer app.If you really want to play something similar, just buy the original MNC for 5 euros, it is a lot better than this.

Hilarious commentators and animations packed with some intense pvp. The only draw back is the lack of a big community.			",183,21,1,17,7,0,12

												Poor match-making system, buggy, poor menu layout, poor character diversity and unbalanced classes... but actually pretty darn fun when you can get in to a game.If TF2 and DotA had a child, then you'd end up with this game.  Robots continously spawn and follow paths to the other team's base.  You're responsible for clearing the way for the robots so that you can pop the other team's money ball and win.  You level up as you go in the match and spend money to spawn robots, open hidden paths or heal yourself.If you like TF2 and are familiar with DotA game mechanics, then you'll probably like this.  Assuming they ever polish it up and fix the numerous issues.  A temporary distraction between better games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												보통의 AOS보다 쉬워서 그런지 굉장히 재밌다. 특히, 팀포2의 센스를 가져와서 해도 별로 힘들지 않다. 그러나 아직 초기라 그런지 기술과 전략의 개발이 아직 부족한데, 나중에 사람들이 많아지고 전략이 많아지면 굉장히 프로다운 게임이 될 것이라고 예측한다. 아직은 아시아서버에 사람이 적으니 미국 동부 서버를 추천한다.			",134,21,8,16,10,2,14

												I started off playing just for the TF2 awards, but I ended up really liking Super Monday Night Combat.Super MNC is a fast, fun, competitive, and often difficult third-person shooter where you play team-versus-team in a handful of game modes. In ways, it's very similar to Team Fortress 2 and DOTA 2. That might sound strange, but once you try a round or two and get a feel for the play, which involves lots of wacky characters escorting waves of robots to the enemy goal (while blasting the opposing team's robots yourself), you'll see what I mean. Through quirky humor and loads of character upgrades, Super MNC does manage to carve out its own place, however.I found Super MNC to be a bit hard to get into, and not just because other players seem to be godly at the game, but because the tutorial is confusing and doesn't really explain well how everything works. I suspect this is an area the developer had to skimp on, due to the game's odd (botched?) release, and subsequent issues. It's worth it to read up on things and put in some time though - the game is fun and rewarding once you figure everything out.It's a shame the game's maker, Uber Entertainment, has seemingly abandoned this game, as it's still fun to play, and there still seems to be enough people around to find a game to play at just about any time of day. The core game is free to play, however, and there's lots of fun to be had without having to buy in, so it's hard not to recommend Super MNC, even in it's somewhat neglected state.

												Remember the original Monday Night Combat? Well now think of it but with way more playable characters. Remember how people talk about there being a 10th class in TF2? Well this game has gone 10th class and BEYOND!That's what Super MNC is. Lead your robots to the enemy Moneyball as your old favourites such as the super-optimistic Assault or the silent and sneaky Assassin, or as one of the new and unexpected faces of the competition such as the hulking Veteran, the over-the-top gorilla actor Cheston, the cute yet tough rollerskating Megabeth, the living boombox Robohobo, the loony and twisted Wascot, or Leonardo Da Vinci himself!Also, enjoy full-colour commentary and the hilarious antics of SMNC's new announcers: The constantly divorced GG Stack and retired MNC veteran Chip Valvano.The Rules Have Changed, but the action stays the same. It's Monday night, the bacon and churros are still delicious, and the Pros are ready!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I admit it, I only play it for the TF2 hats, even though I quite like it.It is a cool TPS game with some defense elements (just play Blitz mode to find out), and most classes are easy to play, especially the rocket launcher girl.HOWEVER:-Last update was a year ago. Seriously? -You can barely find any players. Everyday you only see about 400 players-Only 4 game modes, and one of them is just a practice mode-More P2W than NFS World and APB combined! I mean, 15 bucks for a damn gun?!?!?It is a good game, but the developers didn't give a f*** about it for a very long time and it died, just like that stupid PC Gamer app.If you really want to play something similar, just buy the original MNC for 5 euros, it is a lot better than this.

												If your a seasoned MOBA player or a 3rd person shooter player trying to get into the MOBA genre, this is a game for you. It is what team fortress 2 would be if it was a MOBA. Hilarious commentators and animations packed with some intense pvp. The only draw back is the lack of a big community.			",183,21,1,17,7,0,12

												I have many complaints about this game.  It's abandoned by the developers.  New players are discouraged by obsessive fans.  There's not much learning to do but it is all painful without any way to practice or learn easily.  Moba-inspired mechanics catastrophically mixed with instant death traps, tiny maps and a real lack for any players to find shelter due to most abilities and a number of weapons having infinite range without falloff (most weapons still do almost no damage but prohibit regen at distance) Still a fun, intense, hectic game.  It scratched an itch that's hard to reach and the artists are incredibly talented.A pity the developers do not care about this brand and completely failed to learn from their mistakes people complained heavily about during the run of the game's predecessor, Monday Night Combat, which is also dead.

												Great free-to-play, multiplayer fun. This game has a very steep learning curve but it is well worth it in the end! Many custom classes, endorsements, products, outfits, etc, to help you customize classes to your liking, but not so far as to be overpowered or unfair. The narration is great, and the game environment itself is very fun without being cheesey. Super Monday Night Combat has been described as being like a third-person shooter version of Dota or Starcraft.The only issue I have with this game is that outfits (except promos) require you to spend real cash. However, I don't necessarily have any complaints about it, because the game is free, after all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played this game like crazy, but never bothered to review it. SMNC is a fantastic game! It is sad though that as time went on, the player population dwindled. All that remained in the matchmaking queue was experienced teams dominating the newbies. There's just not much incentive to play if there's hardly anybody playing or if the playing field isn't level, especially for new people. Also another thing is that Uber pretty much has stopped supporting the game for a long while now. That is sad because this game is great and has many fans(especially me). When they started working on Planetary Annihilation, that was pretty much the death blow to this game.I haven't fired up the game in many months, so I don't know what the climate is now, but i'll always remember the good times! Particularly in 2012 and early 2013, when there were many people playing and was fully supported!			",21,1,0,5,0,0,0

												FPSMOBA. amazing concept. well balanced. lots of fun. no player base or servers in australia. All grapples are done client side, rather than server side, because of this, playing with americans on american servers is not fun at all. the engine leaves a lot to be desired in this regard. graphics are alright though. no support for amd eyefinity or nvidia surround, the devs are of the opinion that 3 monitors and wide FOV is cheating. it's not pay to win, but paying gives you a massive advantage...

												A very fun game worth the downoad. Sadly it is currently very buggy in it's main menu of the game. Selecting quick match will likely get you into a game within about 3 minutes, but you will end up going in and out of queue for practically no reason. I have had the game crash on me at least 3 times because of this main menu. Altogether, I'd say this game is worth the download and a good way to waste time for a while, but not something you can enjoy for many matches.			",132,22,0,42,1,0,5

												This moba game here is just disappointing and boring. I'm of the opinion that they messed up a lot here and I wouldn't recommend to play it. Lets take a look at the characters. They are quite funny and cool designed, but their skills and stats are just unbalanced. If you're used to play games like Dota or LoL and you're into strategic stuff then you should better NOT play this game here. Most people I met ingame were focusing on killing enemy players. They simply pressed rightclick - which is the button for grab - and killed you almost instantly. Thats all the game is about. Leftclick-Rightclick-Leftclick...Farm a few minions, then go for the players and thats it. Nothin' special, no real laning phase, no shop or opportunity to buy items to counter an enemy.

So I waited in queue again, this time for 22 minutes. Still nothing. Set it to search for any available games, let it sit for a while. An hour late it was still searching. No idea if it's just the time (200+ current games being played) or that all the servers are full and last for 3 hours, or some sorta somthin. I can't actually say if this game is good, or anything for that matter, as it's been about 3~ hours worth of waiting now and I haven't played so much as the title screen.But hey, free TF2 items.

												Comparison to the first, is not exactly fair in this case, this is more of an issue of MNC feeling like the beta to this being the full.Its free to play, (at least for now) so give it a try.  Now, something to keep in mind for old schoolers of MNC, this is not the OMGOHKfest of the original. Teamwork is needed, there is no replacing turrets, and well, its a lot more DotAesque.   Another unfair comparison, is to tf2. This doesnt have the soloist, instant gratification of tf2, No crocket/uber wins here.  Now, for everyone else..IF you are looking for a really decent TEAM based game, you got it.IF you think strategy is more then spam healing, and crits, you got it.IF you like strategy games, but hated the inability to evade simple attacks, you got it.IF you like shooting things along the way, well... you get the idea. This game posesses possibly the strongest emphasis on team play of any I've come across so far, and uniquely balanced characters who hold their roles well.			",192,14,0,11,8,0,6

												I admit it, I only play it for the TF2 hats, even though I quite like it.It is a cool TPS game with some defense elements (just play Blitz mode to find out), and most classes are easy to play, especially the rocket launcher girl.HOWEVER:-Last update was a year ago. Seriously? -You can barely find any players. Everyday you only see about 400 players-Only 4 game modes, and one of them is just a practice mode-More P2W than NFS World and APB combined! I mean, 15 bucks for a damn gun?!?!?It is a good game, but the developers didn't give a f*** about it for a very long time and it died, just like that stupid PC Gamer app.If you really want to play something similar, just buy the original MNC for 5 euros, it is a lot better than this.

												A fun game when the population was high. Thesedays fewer and fewer people play this game anymore, which decreases the enjoyment I receive from playing this game.No anti-cheat in the game is a fairly large minus, in my mind. You'll never know if that sniper is just really good or that he is using cheats to get 3 headshots in a row on you while you're both jumping and moving around like crazy.It's a fun first person MOBA like game. Balance is somewhat normal, though each class is OP or UP depending on the player and how much they have been ""fed"".Since it's free, why not try it for a bit?			",286,53,2,41,29,5,62

												For those who are big on action, Inuyasha has plenty of that to go around, as well. The violence, which usually involves Inuyasha slashing and hacking away at demons, can be a bit graphic and bloody at times, and is not for the younger readers. It's a good thing Yasha is part demon; if he were fully human, he'd NEVER survive most of the fights that he takes part in. Indeed, because of the violence and bloodshed (and brief, rare nudity), I'm inclined to give this the ""Teens Only"" label. Fortunately, the characters and story DO NOT take a back seat to the fighting, so it's not like watching ""Dragon Ball Z"" with demons.The artwork for Inuyasha (both the Manga and the Anime) is excellent, as is expected from Takahashi. She has a smooth, clean shonen artwork style; it could be viewed as a bit cartoonish because of the lack of details, but it's simple, and pleasing to the eye; very similar to the later works of Kosuke Fujishima (creator of ""Oh My Goddess!"" and ""You're Under Arrest!"").

												Great for a mix of FPS and MOBA, but suffers from varying balances that depend greatly on the performance and presence of each player in teams of 5. SMNC offers a sense of tf2-like characters and design, but still succeeds in its own original design. (86/100) EDIT: I don't reccomend it anymore as the devs have completely abandoned it (I wouldn't put faith in them for future products either since they seem to drop products and move on.)

												I started off playing just for the TF2 awards, but I ended up really liking Super Monday Night Combat.Super MNC is a fast, fun, competitive, and often difficult third-person shooter where you play team-versus-team in a handful of game modes. In ways, it's very similar to Team Fortress 2 and DOTA 2. That might sound strange, but once you try a round or two and get a feel for the play, which involves lots of wacky characters escorting waves of robots to the enemy goal (while blasting the opposing team's robots yourself), you'll see what I mean. Through quirky humor and loads of character upgrades, Super MNC does manage to carve out its own place, however.I found Super MNC to be a bit hard to get into, and not just because other players seem to be godly at the game, but because the tutorial is confusing and doesn't really explain well how everything works. I suspect this is an area the developer had to skimp on, due to the game's odd (botched?) release, and subsequent issues. It's worth it to read up on things and put in some time though - the game is fun and rewarding once you figure everything out.It's a shame the game's maker, Uber Entertainment, has seemingly abandoned this game, as it's still fun to play, and there still seems to be enough people around to find a game to play at just about any time of day. The core game is free to play, however, and there's lots of fun to be had without having to buy in, so it's hard not to recommend Super MNC, even in it's somewhat neglected state.

												Remember the original Monday Night Combat? Well now think of it but with way more playable characters. Remember how people talk about there being a 10th class in TF2? Well this game has gone 10th class and BEYOND!That's what Super MNC is. Lead your robots to the enemy Moneyball as your old favourites such as the super-optimistic Assault or the silent and sneaky Assassin, or as one of the new and unexpected faces of the competition such as the hulking Veteran, the over-the-top gorilla actor Cheston, the cute yet tough rollerskating Megabeth, the living boombox Robohobo, the loony and twisted Wascot, or Leonardo Da Vinci himself!Also, enjoy full-colour commentary and the hilarious antics of SMNC's new announcers: The constantly divorced GG Stack and retired MNC veteran Chip Valvano.The Rules Have Changed, but the action stays the same. It's Monday night, the bacon and churros are still delicious, and the Pros are ready!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A nice take on the Moba style of game with the setting MNC offering a nice amount of humour, a 3rd person shooter with the standard creeps and towers of a moba. There is currently a lack of players so finding games can take a while and the skill difference between players can vary wildly because of this with a team of relativly new players being put against a player with alot more skill which can lead to some frustrating games where one player can win the game for a team. But in those few games where you get a good balance of teams the game play is enjoyable there is also a PvE mode called blitz (a fairly standard horde style mode) if waiting for a PvP game takes too long or if PvP isn't your thing. It's a free to play game that's worth a look if you're stuck for new games to play			",115,31,2,20,7,2,39
