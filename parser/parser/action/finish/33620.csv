												Have you ever picked up a game from a bargain bin, back in the days before Steam sales, just on a whim? Out of a little pool of obscure titles, picking up one you've never heard of, and giving it a shot just because you can, and it's cheap. And sometimes, it'd be mediocre, or broken. But sometimes, you'd end up with an awesome experience that you'd never have come across otherwise. This game, in my opinion, is the latter case.It's a budget title, sure. That shows through in quite a few occasions, be it skyscrapers abruptly appearing with a low draw distance, or the hard-to-place voice acting. But as far as outright fun goes, the game only spends the first half pretending at all that the story is anything but an excuse to put you in increasingly preposterous vehicles and doing awesome things.Many game mechanics are introduced, and some instructions seem to be outright missing from the game (when tailing someone in the open world, for example, you must destroy their car when the timer runs out, despite no hint that you should do so unless you fail to). But overall, this is an arcade racer at the very core of it. Some control issues (those of you using 360 controllers must use the D-Pad to scroll through menus), poor design choices (you must go back to the menus to go back into the open world when you've finished a mission) and strange missions (collecting tickets from cameras to pay off collateral damage costs?) hamper the experience a bit, but the core racing and pursuit is fun.There is a point where the main story stops taking itself seriously. You will know the exact line where this happens. At that point, it becomes much, much more fun. Treat it like a campy romp through the Autobahn, with the excessive driving of an 80's TV show and the pyrotechnics of a Michael Bay movie, and you'll get exactly that. And a monster truck. You also get a monster truck. So there's that.You unlock more tracks and cars by playing through the game, and while there are plenty of street races on the open highway, there are also legitimate race courses, which add a nice variety to the overall experience. You can take on races with undercover cop cars, tuners, a Formula 1 car, and armored trucks, so you can make any race as intense or as preposterous as you'd like. I can't vouch for the multiplayer experience, having yet to try this with someone else, but from my single-player look at Single Race mode, it seems pretty solid. Reminds me of the classic NFS games, especially with mods that let you drive firetrucks and such.In short, a surprisingly intense thrill ride on the cheap, with some design quirks here and there that may strike you as odd, but aren't nearly bad enough to make this game hard at all to recommend. Also, cool original soundtrack.			",202,57,48,14,17,5,10

												This game is surprisingly good! I have really only spent time exploring the city and it is extremely fun! When you get the cheat to unlock all cars you can spend hours just driving around and blowing cars up. The graphics are really good and the car handling is even better. The missions are kinda boring and the voice acting is horrendous, but theres way more to the game then that. Highly recommended!			",90,5,6,2,19,0,28

												Playing this game is like playing a bad action cop movie. The dialogue and voice acting are hilarious because they're trying their best to put on their American badass cop accents and use American badass cop lingo, but they're all clearly untrained German actors. I feel bad laughing though becase they've clearly put their hearts into it. The game looks good and there is enough action to keep you engaged, but the difficulty of the missions varies wildly and I'm still not sure how to finish mission 1.4 in which you spot the bad guy, the game goes into a quick cut scene, then it comes out of it and he races out of sight as you try to catch him and the mission fails 15 seconds later.Only worth the on-sale price, but it's brainless fun in a believable world if you can get it cheap.

												So far of what I've played of this game, it's been pretty fun.  Interesting take on a racing game where YOU are the cop.  The minimap is great (shows traffic) the AI cars react well to the police lights and sirens and get out of the way and you get a real feeling of speed when ripping through town going after some car theif.I'd say for 2.50 it's def worth it, It may be a bit shallow for full proce.

												Very good game for the price! I remember playing the first one long time ago and the latest is so much better. Dont expect much of a story, character development, etc. Voice acting is cheesy but not terrible. What really matters is that this game is actually fun. The handling is the best part in my opinion. Every car is noticeably different and how each one behaves actually makes sense. Overall the handling is on realistic side, but still arcade enough to go nuts! Damage system is decent, but will not have an impact on gameplay. Vehicle selection is plentiful and some cannot be found elsewhere. Visuals are great where it matters in such game, yet its very easy on the hardware. The game does support gamepads and every action can be individually assigned and even deadzones can be adjusted.But wait, there is splitscreen!!! When was the last time splitscreen happened on PC? This is great if you want to hang out with an old friend and have simple fun.			",150,12,15,8,3,0,10

												Very fun, it feels like a car crime simulator if that makes any sense... It's all about crimes in a reality driving form... Obviously like most driving games are not like GTA V how you can exit your vehicle at will. This game takes it to the next level despite the unrealistic shooting-out-of-the-car concept but, the physics and controls work flawlessly. I love the 2nd Person mode because in a real life scenario you are driving the car, and the view of that, is exactly like 2nd person... Now what this game has an advantage over most games is that you can add your own music to the game... All you have to do is simply convert your music to a .MP3 file and click and drag the file into: OS (Operating System) > Program Files (x86) > Steam > SteamApps > common > Crash Time III > My Music | Thats how you listen to your own music in Crash Time 3, I think it's a unique feature, I just felt the need to mention it to you guys :D Overall I will give this game a 10/10!!

												You play a pair of highway patrolmen with speech impediment who are possibly autistic or otherwise have special needs. The game plays more akin to Driv3r or a little bit like Need for Speed Underground rather than something like Burnout or Flatout.Overall I’d say 3/5 – get it for cheap and enjoy it if you like fun driving games.The good:•	I think it looks beautiful and the city design is fun and immersive•	Driving while not super realistic is a lot of fun•	Kind of cool cop things to do like shoot cars and release RC bomb robots•	Solid brainless funThe bad:•	Mini-map and check points frequent all you can eat♥♥♥♥♥♥buffets•	OMG that voice acting•	Crashes feel like hard rubber slapping together and don’t really add anything•	Many open ended aspects of the game are not well laid outOther thoughts:•	Driving sometimes feels a bit plasticy but it’s not necessarily a bad thing – just more of an arcade feel than a sim feel.•	It’s obviously a European city with all European signs and♥♥♥♥♥♥so if you speak European maybe you’d get more Easter eggs out of it.

												Ive been aware of this series for years, but never played one until now.  You play as a cop and do driving only missions, this game has no out of vehicle aspect.  The physics/handling are enjoyable and quite good for the genre.  Despite the semi-realistic handling you have NOS, and crashes sometimes cause large fiery explosions. Graphics are kind of good for the era (2009), though textures and models are kind of lacking at the same time.  Voice acting is cheesy.  Apparently the 4th & 5th releases of CT are out in Germany.  For $2 its not bad, its kind of like a german version of the game ""Driver"", with a touch of ""Burnout""			",58,0,5,1,7,1,3

Unfortunately this game is brought down by a good, if not slightly hazy graphics engine, a camrea angle that's not quite ever right nomatter which view you choose, voice acting that makes you cringe, and limited and uninteresting activities. Purchase it for a few dollars if you want to cruise around a new city. Maybe don't buy it to have a great time in events of challenges though.

												Right....... Where do I start?I orignally got this game because A.It was on sale, And B because my brother used to have this on Xbox 360.I played the demo on 360 but never knew it was on pc! So I bought it and played it for a bit and ......The gameplay is sluggish The loading times take forever!The price before it was on sale was a rip off!But!!!!!!If you enjoy police chasing games then this is for you!The graphics look great!The sound is decent!I would recommend this only, AND I MEAN ONLY if you have played this on 360 and fought ""Hmmmm might be good"" And buy it.4/10Check out my youtube channel www.youtube.com/DarthVaderFan92 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hey there look I just got this game on sale and its pretty good , looks a little dated maybe but runs real smooth , basicaly if you are a fan of mission based racing type games which are set in an open world  this ""open world"" is very detailed and the geometry seems spot on so does the physics , impressive for games at this price  ....

												I can't say I really enjoy this game. The scenery and free-roaming ability are nice, but the story just isn't very enjoyable and the gameplay could be a lot more interesting. You can put in your own soundtracks, which made the game a lot more bearable, but it still didn't feel like I was doing much besides getting scolded for eating doughnuts after arresting someone.The game tries to mix realism with arcade qualities, but it doesn't turn out well. Give this game a try if you want, but I don't recommend it.			",133,26,3,8,36,0,35

												I've had my eyes on this game a long time. I watched gameplay and saw the positive reviews that compliment its gameplay but criticise its story, ergo proclaiming the game as ""good"". So I got it and...14 minutes. 14 MINUTES and I already hate it! Driving is way too loose, the damage is actually underwhelming compared to other games with heavily destructible cars, cutscenes, premise and voice acting are all god-******* awful, and even on low settings (for me anyway) the game is just an absolute lagfest! At least it actually looks good, and while default controller setup is a bit strange, it's widely customisable for your preferred play style, which is good.Don't take my word for it, play it yourself and enjoy it. I just ended up immediately hating it much more than I thought I would, even at the €2.49 that I paid for it.			",78,21,9,10,8,2,2

												Should you buy this game? Nes. That means ""yes"" and ""no"", at the same time.Everything in this game sucks. But... somehow, it's actually pretty decent, especially if you get it on sale. The graphics are not the best, and it's a bit laggy even on capable hardware, the story is okay, and the voice-acting is hilariously bad. This game is bad. But paradoxically, that's good. It's fun, easy to get involved in, and incredibly mindless. No need to put any effort into it. And I think, for a laugh, this is a good game. Don't expect super cereal stuff.Graphics: 7/10. Dated and oddly glossy everywhere. A bit laggy - often dropping below 30 fps - on my system, which is more than capable of running this. Story: 6/10. Be a German cop and drive everywhere. Not too shabby a story.Sound & Music: Music in this game is bland Euronoise. Play your own tunes above it. Sounds are pretty goood. Engines are loud and nice, crashes have a nice audible crunch.Gameplay: 8/10. Linear plot, but freeroam is nice. EVERYTHING EXPLODES. Overall: 7/10.			",96,18,6,6,8,0,2

												Unfortunately what starts off as a relatively fun game turns out to be quite devoid of content or interest after a few hours.Gameplay feels solid and presentation is good even with the strange English voice acting.
