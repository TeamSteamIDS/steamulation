Very dead. But, when it still had a playerbase, it was pretty amazing. It NEEDS some more people. I don't even know why they left, one day there were tons of people, the next... nothing.

												*sighs* this game really did have great potential. This game is truely ground breaking I must say that but the game is almost dear and is a hard to master game the title of the game shows what this HL2 mod is ETERNAL SILENCE. If you do the addbot command the bots are normally broken sadly I wish this game had the respect it deserves. My final rating for this game is a 10/10 but please get this game back up again.

												A brilliant venture into the fps/space sim genre in the form of an extensive Half Life 2 mod. I think it's free also. The only issue is that it never got popular enough to sustain enough players in the game in order to have online matches. If you feel like having a match though, send me a PM.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Screw it, I'm writing a review and I don't care how minor this game is! The people must know that there are actually fun games out there that don't force you to buy DLC! that doesn't restrict F2P players from doing anything until you pay a pay wall! This, this is Eternal Silence! why is it silent you may ask? because people either don't know this exists or they abandonned it! that's naturally how these games die...So it's Eternally Silent until you get on the game.So what is Eternal Silence? It is an online (dead) starfighter/PVP/FPS running on the Source engine, (an engine I think indie developers need to start using more often instead of trying to be f****ing Minecraft) so if you've played Gmod or Half-Life I think you'll feel at home...But with starships thrown in as extra. Now don't worry, it's not GWFL dead, it's just no one plays it. Of course this game was released in 2007 which would probably be one of the worst years to release an indie game when Halo 3 and Mass Effect are looming over you like towering giants shadowing every other game. I'm guessing that's the main reason why no one heard about it, but just because it has ""outdated gwaphics!"" and it's using the Source engine doesn't mean you should club it into the ground like a brute. All I ask is that you give Eternal Silence a chance! Hell, I can't even describe the combat because I can't test it on anyone! there aren't even any bots, so this review is missing a large chunk of information just because no one will get on the damn thing.The story: as far as I can tell there isn't one! ""Peter, you know how these online PVP games work! just look it up on their website!"" First of all I find it morally wrong to force players out of the game so they know what in the hell is going on around them! Just look at Destiny! it's a drooling abomination in a corner being milked to death by those CoD ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! And second of all If you have played Planetside 1 the developers strictly made an online MMOFPS, one of the first in fact (until PS2 came along and f****ed it up trying to be Battle Field) and it explained that universe's technology, atmosphere, and planets while still being a First Person Shooter. Now? developers have become lazy asses so they put the story on a damn website instead of it being part of the game you bought with your hard earned cash! and then they have the balls to say: ""make up your own story, because we obviously don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥anymore! :D""So here's my story of Eternal Silence: Attack on Bee-Bop Island. A very long long long long long long time into the future far far far away from 2014 in a galaxy somewhere no one knows about or cares... Jeff A space Republican't dude: ""Well Bob, we did it! we built space ships, built cities on alien worlds, absorbed aliens into our culture so we can have hot alien-human sex with 'em, and cured all forms of cancer."" Bob Some guy with Jeff who may or may not be a democat: ""We definitely came a long way Jeff...""  Jeff: ""Well, I'm bored now...Let's paint eachother in red and blue and bomb the hell out of each other while killing millions of innocents in the crossfire because that shows you how we don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥"" Bob: ""Yeah! but we need something to fight over...Hmmm...I know! Space! let's fight over space! because nothing is something unless it has a line next to the number!"" Jeff: ""And metal! we need metal to make more bullets! I'll head on home and start drawing what our troops would look like but the texture quality can't run the amount of detail I'm thinking of!""Bob: ""okay Jeff! murder you tomorrow!"" And then everyone died and now the game is at the bottom of the barrel in Steam's Library. THE END??? Question Mark!Final verdict: But to sum it all up, it's a free to play game you can download at any time and you can invite your friends to play it with you. No paying involved it's 100% free...Well, unless you count space on your computer and your time. Now what exactly is the score for this game going to be? well, for a mod it's a pretty good shooter...But I have to give it a 3/10. Why you may ask? well there are still quite a few bugs left behind. Bots no longer spawn (as far as I know, it look's like there were bots but they aren't in the game in it's current state) the class system is sort of useless since all you really need in a small hanger is a machine gun, and the rocket launcher might as well be firing pebbles instead of actual rockets. It's a fun game, especially with friends! but it doesn't offer enough content to keep you coming back for more. But until someone releases a cool online PVP game that isn't trying to be someone else's game- I'm ranking Eternal Silence to a 3/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fascinating full 3D six-axis shooter in space. It is fine game but sadly very dead with under 10 players online at most. (Last time I checked in July 2011.) A hidden gem in the Steam library if you ask me. Free too! Try it out, just for the sake of feeling that delicious loss of sense of direction. If you have a large group of friends or are interested in spicing up your LAN party GET THIS GAME NOW.As a bonus the combat feels like Freelancer.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: -/5 (There is no story from what I remember.)Gameplay: 4/5Challenge: 4/5Discovery: 2/5Replayability: 4/5Aesthetics: 3.5/5Visuals: 3.5/5Atmosphere: -/5 (I didn't play the game enough to get into it.)Music: 4/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On a working server  messing around i also figured out how to play.  Was rather fun and exciting.  If you own Half Life 2, get this mod game and play it.   Needs alot more people to play.

												I played this game when it actually had people playing it, back in 2009 or 2010. Back then I had a blast with this game, space combat was engaging, and as somewhat clunky as it was the ground combat was still pretty fun. Note how I'm writing in the past tense, as none of this relevant now as I haven't seen anyone playing this since late 2013, the community was strong at one point but suddenly vanished seemingly overnight. Would I recommend people play this game? Hell yes, that's exactly what this game needs to exist as a functional multiplayer game, a playerbase. This would be fun to play with a small group of friends, but sadly that's all this game has to offer in it's current state. My 2009-2010 rating = 8/10 a really overlooked game, even back in it's prime - despite the bugs & lack of servers, a very enjoyable & fun game.My 2016 rating = 1/10 does this game even exist any more?

												Like a mix of Planetside 2 and Fractured Space, but predating both. I spent so much time on this game back in the day. There is fairly little variation in levels and game modes (my absolute favorite was the TDM with the central space station), but it is addicting all the same. I spent so many hours on this game - it's truly a classic. I certainly hope whoever developed this mod landed a well-paying job in the games industry, because they definitely deserved it.[Edit] It only shows that I have about 25hrs playtime, but I feel like that must be a mistake. At least double that is more like what I'd estimate.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game if you get to play it, less uints than star wars battlefield, but it has a stronger atmosphere. If you have some extra space on your HDD download it. If there are no servers when you launch it, move around a bit, try the different space crafts. Playing this game was an unique exerience for me, and years later I still smile when I think about the times they driven back our attack but I stayed on board as a hacker(light class, can place turrets).

												Eternal Silence is a sci-fi mod for the Source Engine. Two capital ships fight against each other in space warfare.Pilots coordinate strikes with invading infantry in order to take down the behemoth capital ships from both the inside and outside.Eternal Silence has a good variety of warplanes to pilot as well as many different infantry classes. A few problems still need to be removed, such as the glitch with the fighters on some maps that hurl you instantly into the hangar wall. Also the graphic could be much better. All in all, this mod is a good space action. Unfortunately there are only empty servers nowadays.Sounds 6/10Graphics 5/10Gameplay 6/10Atmosphere 6/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This mod is most likely one of the better mods out there. Let me first start that this is a space game. While the plot is a little bit silly, it's at least free. (if you have a Source Game that is)It's a multiplayer mod, and the idea of it is to conquer the opposing player's ship, or capture the flag. It depends on what gamemode you're playing. But for the most part, the classic gamemode is the one where you blow up ""corvettes"" or mothership defenders, and then you land in the enemy player's base and then start capturing points like you would in Hat Simulator 2. You can ride ships around. (Interesting concept for a source game, and probably more difficult to do.)It's worth a shot. It is something you will get bored with maybe, but it's a free mod, who cares?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's sad that the company that made this wonderful source game did absolutely next to no marketing for it!  The same thing happened with their other title that was recently released!  That's most likely why the game died...  Not because the game was boring, or getting old (well maybe it is now), or buggy or unsupported by devs... just not enough people played because no one knew about it!   I see people are going gaga over Star Citizen with it's Arena Commander and Space Marine modes... wow! fight in space and board capital ships!  Um ok. 2015 and they still haven't released it...  ES was released in 2007 and already has that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you enjoyed games like X-Wing and Freespace, then this game is definetely worth checking out. Its free, also, so thats cool too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although similar to a well known team based, multiple class shooter with vehicles, Eternal Silence focuses specifically on space battles, both by ship and by foot and improves the gameplay of the genre. Easy to pick-up and go, especially if you have any 3d shooter experience, hard to master. Boarding capital ships has never been so much fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very nice space-fighter game, and the only reputable aircraft on the Source engine. If you want a free fighting dog-fighting game with some ground combat and objectives thrown in, download and support this amazing mod.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a simply out of this world Sourcemod. It has a very Star Wars-y feel to it. While the on land comabt is a little wonky, this game makes up for it with its phenomenal space combat. If you're a fan of Sci-Fi and of FPS games, this is definitely for you. Best of all, its FREE if you have a source game. If you don't have a source game, what is wrong with you? Go get some!7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is truely amazing. If this were an actual Game, I would honestly buy. The game is a multiplayer type game, in the sense that it runs off of an online multiplayer community. Though there is never anyone playing, I still manage to have fun with 3 other players. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone, this suits all players; strategists, FPS players, Role playing, and arguably sport gamers. This is honestly one of the best mods on steam.

												So not too many people play this game anymore.  So I came up with a solution, I created a group for eternal silence.Eternal Silence CommunityThe purpose of this group is to get players to join together to create games and servers.  Using, players like you and I to create or join games.  Hopefully, this group helps to get people to play eternal silense again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is awesome, it has different gamemodes that can givv u tons of hours of gameplay.A normal day is like this:loading creen... waiting, waiting... server list empty, gotta refresh.oh here is one game, entering.waiting, waiting... TIME TO PLAYselect one type of soldier, (carbine wielding soldier OFC) and go to hangar, take one ship and start the combat.everyone is doing the rigth stuff, bombers are punishing the enemy corvets, fighters are covering them, we even have a transport ship deploying some ammo and shield power to our allies... good. I'll take an interceptor so i can destroy their bomber and some of their heavy fighters if im lucky.20 minutes o air combat, the last corvette of the enemy exploded seconds ago and we are ready to enter the hangar of the space station, my duty now is to protect the transport ship so the pilot will be able to enter the hangar and set a respawn point for the army, then ill clear the space of the enemys ships that are trying to hunt our heavier ships down.jobs done and im assaulting the enemy base by foot, flanking seems a good option cause they are fortified. Shieet they have an engie with a remote controlled smg this corridor is no more an option unless we find a grenadier, CHAT: need a grenadier at weaponry♥♥♥♥♥ enemy corvettes are back so we cant assault the enemy base by ships, we need to hold the hangar and respwan there so we have a chance. A railgun will hold'em back *DEADwell the hangar is lost so it beggins again, now we don't have the upperhand anymore cause our corvettes are already damaged, we need to fight harder. this is not over.CHAT: interceptor pilot rdy, target an enemy.

												Feels like a UT2004 mod. But for source. You do space station battle. Can board smaller craft to board big craft. Fight it out in hangars with infantry. Man mounted cannons. Star fighters.Wonder if there's anyone still playing it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
