												This game ""Xotic"" (pronounced exotic), although I continually call it zotic for some unknown reason, is a splendid blend of bejeweled meets unreal tournament. The focus here is on scoring and making the most of the multiplyers within each of the many differing score attack levels there are in the game. Usually, there are 3 goals to complete to attain a perfect 5 star rating for your actions during gameplay. Those goals are: gathering all the essence, eliminating all the scabs, and finding all the brains. Essence is a colorful diamond type figure dotted around the levels and can be acquired by running through them. The scabs are red rooted circles in the ground that you must shoot consecutively to form chains which increase your point scoring potential. Finally, the brains are mysterious objects that float and explode once shot and resemble a fireworks effect that is usually fairly awe inspiring. There are also essence, brain, and scab attack modes that challenge the player to complete the level in the quickest time possible. The scoring system for all phases of the game is superb, as well as the leaderboard system. Although this is a challenging game, its a breakthru product as far as first person shooter scoring games go.			",276,53,11,39,32,1,46

												The best timed combo fps :DXotic is the best ""time mode"" fps i ever played. Most people who gave this game a bad review don`t understand it`s not about killing the enemy it`s about collecting as many points you can in the shortest amount of time. I like the different game modes especially the Essece Attack. I don`t like when it gets stuck in a few places and sometimes the AI don`t agro the player and also i wish the AI to be much aggressive in the hard level. I wish developers will introduce coop modes to the game and also a TD mode :DIn my opinion the game is brilliant: easy to learn but difficult to master :D (there are some hardcore players in the lederboards :P ) Ps. To bad wxp games can`t finish the last dlc here is a mini review on my site explaining game mechanics and why xotic collective dlc was canceled http://selo.ro/selo/xotic-no-collective-dlc/  (use google translate)			",371,68,20,33,21,6,64

												A really entertaining shooter with an arcade approach. The game combines aspects of Shooting Galleries, Speed Running and Platforming. The usual issues of platforming in 3D/FPS are handled quite nicely by the ""Hard Hologram Technology"" that allows you to summon a platform right beneath your feet for a meager energy cost. Collect awesome powerups, fight interesting enemies and upgrade your weapons and abilities over multiple regions full of levels. The graphics and music round this out with a really vibrant and fun presentation, full of color and interesting art design. Also the developer support for the game has to be mentioned. They listen to their audience and are constantly tweaking and improving the game at every level, from options and technical issues to the gameplay and maps.			",961,222,15,134,84,5,161

GameplayThe game mostly plays like a traditional First Person Shooter, where the screen is your field of view, with a small proportion of it at the bottom taken up by your weapon (the symbiotic Macroterra bug), and an area at the top of the screen is your H.U.D.. You move around the maze with the usual combination of WASD (PC version) with additional actions using the Space and Tab keys... As is customary now, the game uses mouselook, and the mouse buttons fire your primary and secondary weapons... the scroll wheel is also used to change between different fire modes, and unusually, scrolling up changes the primary by looping through the available attacks, and scrolling down changes the secondary. For me, this took a little bit of getting used to, although I tended to stick with the same attacks.Where xotic differs from other FPS games however, is the emphasis on scoring points, collecting multipliers, beating the clock and getting a High Score on each level... there are lots of ways to ramp up the points too, with bonuses for killing enemies while in mid-air... collecting Orb essence in mid-air... racking up long chains of scab plant kills.. etc. It also feels like a 3d platform game, as a lot of the time you will be jumping either between objects, or onto platforms that you create.Another main difference is that enemies are a lot less frequent than in most FPS games, with maybe a dozen or so on each level, in varying combinations of moving humanoid enemies and static gun emplacements. There are also some nasty crawling insects that spawn from hard to spot dirt-heaps. Therefore the main focus of play is in shooting the scab plants, collecting the orb essence and killing the orb brains in the time, though all the enemies need to be killed in order to complete the level, and this can be done regardless of what proportion of the other goals you have completed.The focus on collecting points over killing enemies makes the game feel a bit more casual for a First Person Shooter, however the time pressure and level design definitely doesn't make it an easy game.Graphics and SoundWhile not the best FPS game graphics I've seen, Xotic certainly has a very distinctive and rather lush graphical style that seems to fit the game rather well... there's also an interesting contrast between the background, which is a decaying technological world, and the bright colours of the plants that you release by shooting the scabs.The Macroterra weapon is very cool looking, and has some neat animations when you are firing, jumping etc. It does lack the variety of having different weapons that you can change between, like in other FPS games, though the variety of attack types is not lacking, with a total of 8 different primary and secondary weapons.The sound is well done, with some really nice sounds effects for shooting, scoring points, killing enemies etc. While the background music is good, without being either particularly memorable, or too intrusive... it fits in really well with the game and adds to the atmosphere without being distracting in any way.Duration and ReplayabilityI completed the campaign mode in the base game, on easy difficultly, in about 5 hours, which may not sound like much, but is pretty good for the price. There are also 3 other game modes on each level, which are Scab Attack, Essence Attack and Brain Attack, where you concentrate on one type of goal.There are 3 difficulty levels, which affects how much time you have to complete the level, and in addition to that, on each level you earn a star rating out of 5 for how well you performed, so if you are a completionist, then you can spend a lot more time trying to perfect each level. I have managed 5 stars on maybe 60%+ of the levels so far, on easy difficulty.I can see myself dipping into this game occasionally, given the nature of the levels and the slightly casual feel to the game, I see it as a good FPS game to 'relax' with.

												I did not enjoy this game at all. It's fairly solid mechanically speaking, but it just didn't bring the fun. It's hard to stand out in the FPS crowd, and adding a ""collect-a-thon"" spin on the levels did not do it any favors. Definitely watch some gameplay footage before taking the plunge on this one.

												*Gnome Seal of Approval*An unusual 1st person score attack game where each level is covered with three different kinds of objects you need to collect. Some by shooting them, others by moving over them. Finish the level quickly for more points. Long chains also boosts your score. The entire thing is spiced up with an unusual alien world setting and some very light combat.Again, this is not a game for everyone being a straight up score attack game. I had a few hours of fun with it trying to complete each level with a 5 star rating. You need to find the most effective route and find all the hidden objects to get a perfect score.It's not an advanced or especially challenging game. I'm guessing alot of people find it boring even. Which is probably why the metascore is below average.			",279,118,12,29,18,2,44

												Created by: WPXGAMESWhat is Xotic?Xotic is a hybrid arcade-style FPS with vividly luminous graphics and addictive game play mechanics. Eliminate the Orb’s life-sucking presence as you blast enemies, and detonate chain-reactions in a race against the clock, all while discovering secrets, collecting power ups and upgrading your skills. Xotic is an indie throwback made for modern gamers in search of originality. Hone your reflexes and develop a combat strategy that will place you at the top of the global leader board. Are you up to the Xotic challenge?Intro Cinematic to the game Xotic, and first impressions: I really enjoyed the way WXP created the intro to this game, the cinematic. While not a lot of animation, it has a lot of beautiful graphics that help tell the story, along with the narration from the robotic voice. Right off the bat, the sound of the narrator was a bit odd, it felt as if it might not be understandable, but it was very clear in every word spoken.The voice, rising and lowering in tone, sounding ever so strange to this brand new game, became familiar as the story unfolded about the story of the “Orb” that longed to have a physical body. I question, though, the very creation of the Orb, its origins, and its intelligence. It seems rather odd that the story starts off talking about how there is an Orb that is taking over the universe, planet by planet, but with no explanation as to how the Orb came to be, and why it possesses the capability to think and want.The default controls start your sensitivity level at 50%, and it took some adjusting to find out, for me personally, that 90% was just right so that turning didn’t feel too slow, or too fast. As one hundred percent felt uncontrollable.Playing through the first level, the tutorial, I felt the game really explained a lot regarding the point system, and an explanation of each item. I’m referring to the scab plants, the vase, power ups, and aerial collectibles. I, however, did not feel that the game explained well enough how to climb to greater heights to shoot, and collect, other items.Another thing that the tutorial could have explained are the Champions that you face. I found out, the hard way, that Champions are like mini bosses in the game, that are tougher to kill, and do they more damage than regular enemies.Playing through my first bonus round, I really got to feel a lot more of the controls and how they functioned, and a bit of the moving around while jumping. Overall, it’s really becoming pretty fun, though jumping and moving mid-air is a small feat in and of itself. It’s beneficial to get a good feel of where you want to jump, and what you wish to collect, so careful planning in some of your maneuvers is a good idea!Continuing on through the next levels, the game picks up in difficulty, challenging the player to really use strategic shooting, dodging, and making use of their secondary weapons, if they have one. The Champions become tougher, and throwing in machine gun-like enemies makes it even more crucial to watch where you’re standing, and to take cover in order to regenerate health if needed!I’ve finally mastered the art of climbing higher into the air using a combination of jumping + Tab, to put the small nearly invisible shields below me, to creating platforms at just the right time for hitting those extra bonus points, and even dodging enemy attack!The action in Xotic is very fast-paced, the music calming, even in a tough situation when things are difficult. I’m truly having a lot of fun, and enjoying using experience points to unlock new skills, increase my characters attributes, and kicking some serious♥♥♥♥♥OVERALL SCORE: 8/10Sound: 8/10 The music and sound effects are really great in this game, but I don’t care too much for the narrator’s voice.Controls: 9/10 Playing through the game, everything is relatively easy to control. Aiming is great once you have sensitivity set properly, but when it comes to mid-air control and direction, this is where things just don’t feel as smooth. It’s as if you’re trying to jump while in space, with no gravity or sense of control regarding your direction.Graphics: 8/10 The graphics in this game are beautiful, and make me feel as if the environments in the game are really alive. But this also creates a sense of confusion among all the objects your shooting. It’s hard to see the small mountains that release the bugs that explode on you, the machine gun enemies sometimes blend in with the surrounding environment, and the look of the enemies and your own character isn’t the best, but there’s nothing to really ruin the experience that I’ve had with the game.Final Thoughts:Xotic is a really fun, fast paced, action RPG First Person Shooter, with beautiful graphics, lovely music, and an intuitive design on combat and collecting items while constantly improving score.The game is definitely built for the competitive player who thrives to have the highest score.For 9.99 on Steam, Xotic is worth buying and playing through the entire game!About WXP GamesWXP Games is a small independent team of dedicated developers located in Seattle, Washington.

												Pretty short game unless you want to repeat the same stages over and over and over, overall this game is not the best, its combat and movements seem clunky and the camera view of your character is not accurate, they have the camera placed in your characters chest rather than head so when it seems like you can fit though something you actually cant, the platforms become enraging, not even sure how i unlocked them but the more you get the more it turns into a junbled mess of invisible platforms blocking you in even when you are in mid air you can still get trapped from these platforms, enemies are stupid they barely make any sound when attacking you and sometimes you wont even notice your being attacked and then you will suddenly die, maps are boring and seem repetitive, main idea behind game is to just combo everything and get high score. Graphics are pretty crap and constant view of just weapon is annoying. Cant recommend this game, ive played better free ones online. DLC is also pretty average, basically just another average 3 missions, luckily i got this game in a bundle so it works out to about 10cents for whole game and all DLC so i wont hate on its value but its definatly not worth what they are charging.

												Xotic is a score based First person shooter. The point of the game is to get the highest score possible by doing a few things, creating long chains which net you more points, finishing the level quickly, and completing the 3 goals that each level has in order to get a 5 star rating, which also nets you more points. All of these elements combined give you aspects of speed running, score attack, and even some platforming with the ""Hologram's"" that you can deploy mid air and land on. *The game has a very vibrant and neon color pallet, and while the texture quality isn't fantastic, it does still look fairly nice and should run on most systems.*It feature one weapon with multiple different modes that all fire different projectiles (All firing modes besides the default require energy to use, this regerates on its own)*Xotic has upgrades for each different weapon firing mode as well as upgrades for the character.*The game is single player, but a lot of fun of the game comes from trying to beat those on the leader boards, after each level it will show your place on the leader board for the level you just completed.*Xotic has quite a few levels that are interestingly designed and do vary a bit, the game can become repetitive, but i think thats mostly a genre related problem and not Xotic's fault. But the game is very fun in burst playing sessions (At least for me).The game works great using a mouse and keyboard (As a FPS should), I did find that using a controller seems to have weird sensitvity issues, the Y axis is much more sensitive than the X axis, and they can not be adjusted individually, but this is not a problem for most as the keyboard and mouse work just fine.If you're into score attack games, this is one to look at. It has an interesting setting and a very nice color pallet with good score attack mechanics.			",294,59,5,41,42,1,46

												Xotic is the dream game for score attack gamers. It came out back when Valve actually curated the Steam store, meaning the indie games that came on the platform were generally good, or at least not the pisspoor Sh**show it is now with asset flips and student's first GameGuru/Flash/GameMaker game. Xotic is an FPS score attack game that is less focused on combat and more focused on shooting targets (scabs), collecting points, and finding hidden objects. Getting the top scores would require dozens of replays of the same level, allowing near limitless gameplay for score junkies. There's alot of mechanics at play: Shooting scabs that are near each other so they increase your chain, a chain meter that drops unless you shoot more targets, various destructable objects that contribute to your score, extra point dots that pop out of the scabs, dots  that when collected in groups of five while in air, give you an aerial combo bonus, a double/triple jump that is unlock later, a deployable shield that can also be used as a platform when you don't have double jumps, ""brain"" objects that provide alot of points, but need to be searched out and takes many hits to destroy - there's so much here and there are still more mechanics I could list - such as how the level scores you for accuracy and scabs found, and how upgrades are unlocked with experience points.I will say that the slower play style and the ""points over combat"" gameplay will turn off people looking for a great combat experience - the enemies are infrequent, and many of them don't really provide much challenge or engaging combat outside of ""shoot them and don't get shot"". Later levels may have boss/miniboss types, and different enemy types I haven't encountered yet. The weapons, while numerous and effective, feel and sound weak - so even older games like Doom and Goldeneye 007 have more satisfying feeling guns.Xotic is an exotic, unique game that can't be compared to many other games. The game has a look that as one Youtube commenter described as ""Turok on drugs"" - it certainly has a strange, ethereal, and alien look to it. It has a kind of polish and solidity that makes it an easy recommendation from me.			",965,265,43,131,97,11,157

												An incredibly slow game for what it is, which is a ""Score Attack FPS"" of sorts. The level design is pretty crap for this kind of gameplay, and I have to wonder which real FPS the dev couldn't beat on easy mode before he dreamt up this sad attempt at arcade 3D shooting. It's not that it's different, it's a radical departure with undeveloped execution. The ideas only seem new if you haven't played Skulldash. Speaking of which,if you want a good scoring-focused arcade FPS, I recommend Skulldash. Xotic is a game that lets you beat a level you've never seen before in 30 seconds, puts a bunch of crap in front of you, and says you got a nice combo when you jump at it. Then it says you've just completed the bonus round, when you didn't even know you were on some special bonus round in the first few minutes of the actual game in the first place. And it's really slow. Don't even give this game to a baby, it will just turn them into a sucky gamer when they grow up.			",241,8,9,3,4,0,1

Once you've been through a level, you can always revisit, and play in different game modes.It's colorful, the atmosphere is terrific, and there are multiple goals. At the same time, you don't need to play for long periods of time, jumping in, playing a level, and leaving is OK, too.On a scale of fun to pretty, I give it a both.			",107,18,13,11,9,0,10

												Like any good arcade game, it doesn't take very long to get used to the game mechanics but it DOES take a decent amount of skill to rack up high scores. There are rewards for being attentive and thorough and awards for being fast as possible, but to earn the most points you'll have to do both. On the highest difficulty it can get quite challenging to survive the combat levels, but if you're easily frustrated or just like looking around, on easy difficulty you can focus purely on exploring and getting 100% on every level.

												Great for those moments when you have time to spare and you can outdo your previous performance. For most it will be just that - a great game to play for a bit, but not particularly addictive. In some however, it will inspire marathon gaming sessions into the early hours of the morning, bettering your scores and those of others			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Synopsis: A  score based FPS sci-fi game where you must clear the levels of the evil red scarabs and humoniods to terraform the planet back into a habitable place.Genre:Sci-fi/High Score FPSYEA! Score based goal system is great,  multiple types of game modes to complete, lots of levels, great pick it up and play for a few minutes type of game.MEH! Upgrade trees seem to make little difference in gameplay, even though there are multiple weapons i never deviated from the starter one. A counter of items left in the level would be nice. Graphics are on the early ps2 era side.BLEH! Movement controls are too skatey, encountered a bug multiple times that didnt enable mouse in game forcing multiple game resets to finally workThe word: A great pick it up for a few minutes FPS that stands out from the other run of the mill FPSs. Even with the bugs its a great pick up at a decent price.3/5			",439,123,12,73,77,7,70

												Rating 7.5/10OverviewFirst Person Arcade Shooter focus on highscore and timeThe Good:+ The graphics are bright and colorful. I always like it when developers are not afraid to use color in their games. The graphics are not going to blow you away but for the type of game this is, I was surprised. +The game has a variety of different levels broken down into 4 game modes. The first game mode (campaign) is based on achieving a highscore,this is accomplished by killing enemies, collecting essences, destorying orbs, and killing plants and chaining them together. The higher the chain the bigger the points. The other three modes are time based. You either have to collect essences,destory orbs or kill plants within a certain time limit. +The games main focus is on replayability. If you are the type of person to replay levels to constantly get better and better and get higher and higher on the leaderboards, this is the game for you. +In addition to all of this, the game provides plenty of powerups, i.e double damage, flight, double points etc. to make things more interesting+ Different variety of guns to suit your playstyle, although I found only a handful of them useful. +Achievements are somewhat easy to get. The Bad:-The game does not save any of your controller bindings upon startup. You have to adjust it everytime you start the game. The default setting on the controller was good enough for me, however I found this to be pretty sloppy. -the shooting does not have the same weight and feel as other First person shooters. This is more of a minor gripe as the focus on the game isn't necessarily shooting enemies and is somewhat expected from an indie developer.   - The game can feel repetitve at times, their isn't enough in the core gameplay mechanics that would keep the game very interesting for very long  -if your not interested in getting highscores, or beating times you may find this game somewhat boring. -A.I is a bit wierd. Sometimes they do what their suppose to do and other times they just stand there. Conclusion:This is a love/hate type game. I found it somewhat refreshing in the FPS genre focused on something different. I think the game deserves more attention and sales but just make sure you know what your getting yourself into.  If your expecting a fast paced game killing lots of enemies like the old days then you will be disappointed. This is more of an arcade based game that requires some thinking in how your approach the level in order to gain the most points possible. Enjoy.			",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												I...Don't quite know what to say about this game. Easily one of the most strangest first person shooters I've played but that doesn't make it bad in the slightest. The story is there is a orb that has gone corrupt and has corrupted many planets and places. You are a thing called an entity that has this bug insect like gun and your objective is to destroy every trace of the orb's leavings and any enemies you see. This might sound a bit generic and a bit reptitive but the way the game rewards you in points for doing these things is...Satisfying and addictive which makes this a great arcade shooter if you love big colorful numbers when you score points. Only downside is if you're looking to perfect a level, you have to play through it often until you find every single hidden spot that you might have missed during your first few plays on the level.All in all, Xotic is a great game to pick up if you love arcade styled first person shooters and love seeing BIG points			",196,26,2,12,12,4,6

												Supremely boring first person platform shooter with a terrible 'Final Fantasy on ecstacy' visual design that requires you to shoot things and complete objectives as fast as you can to get a high score. Sometimes there are things what will kill you and you have to go slow and play detective for the first few deaths to figure out what's killing you in the first place so you can shoot it to continue! All this and it's so ♥♥♥♥ing boring that playing it for more than thirty minutes is torture.			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

												Xotic reminded me a bit of The Club. The goal is to kill enemies, find secrets and pop red orbs while building up a high score. So there are a lot of similarities. And even though I don't dislike the style of the game (which is colorful), the graphics could definitely use more detail, and polygons in general. The sounds are ok, and the gameplay is solid which makes this an easy recommendation for me.[Rating: 71/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Do you like first person shooters? Play Quake. Do you like puzzle games? Play a puzzle game. Do you like action-packed high score fests? Play Beat Hazard or Jamestown or something. This game is a frighteningly awkward mish-mash of all of the above, where it's all downhill after the actually-cool tutorial. Playing this game is sorta like shoving a Fleshlight up your butt so you can remain a virgin while giving your boyfriend the pleasure of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's basically pointless, it doesn't really work and certainly isn't fun, and leaves you regretting the entire experience.			",417,119,19,45,80,10,93

												Xotic is an arcade-style first-person shooter where you rack up huge scores by shooting enemies, detonating chain reactions, and discovering secret power-ups and point multipliers. Armed with a weaponized symbiotic creature called the Macroterra, you must cleanse the evil presence and re-plant the seeds of life on a planet ravaged by the minions of the Orb.Destroy the insidious scab plants and new life will grow in their place, diminishing the Orb’s control of the planet. Trigger scab plant chain reactions to earn score multipliers and chain bonus points. Collect Orb essence to boost your score, or grab them in mid-air to earn an aerial combo bonus. Seek out and destroy the hidden Orb brains and collect all of the Orb essence in each level for even more points.Earn experience points to upgrade your weapons and skills, including “Absorbtion” which pulls points towards you automatically! Unlock the secrets of “Hard Hologram” technology to deploy mobile shields or aerial landing platforms.Xotic is a unique arcade shooter experience unlike anything you’ve played before. Get it now!
