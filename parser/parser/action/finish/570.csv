												When I first started DOTA2 I was a little overwhelmed, as my first ARTS/MOBA game it was pretty complicated.  I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying.  Before I knew it, I was performing лучше and better.  I stopped making silly ошибки and я got vastly better at not кормление the enemy команда.  For the наиболее part, everyone I've met was very helpful and хороший, there есть the иногда рывок however.  As Я по-прежнему play DOTA2 все более и более, Я уверен, что я буду продолжать совершенствовать.  Я рекомендую эту игру для всех!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Real Dota 2 Dota is a competitive game of action and strategy, played   both professionally and casually  incompetently by millions of enslaved   passionate fans  Russians worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred   heroes  carries, forming two teams of   five players  five feeders. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts   to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare  raging in an unknown language and teamfighting with one RAMPAGE victor.Irresistibly   colorful on the surface  addictive, Dota is a game   of infinite depth and complexity  which requires, no, infact takes an infinite amount of your life away. Every hero has an array of skills and abilities   that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways, to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike  that allow players to screw with their allies and get their teams killed. This is one of the reasons that   the Dota phenomenon has continued to grow  Dota will have more rage quitting and all chat abuse than any other game. Originating as a fan-made Warcraft 3 modification, Dota was an instant underground hit. After coming to Valve, the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive   audience  Russia, so that the rest of the world can   experience the same core gameplay, but with the level of polish that only Valve can provide  learn from these ingenious people and become inspired to spread their knowledge with the rest of the world.Get a taste of the game that   has enthralled millions  will happily teach you fluent russian all for the sweet price of $0. Just choose your server.[imgur.com]  <- LinkNOTE: Original description by Valve, edited by myself.			",419,82,11,40,27,8,50

												DotA 2 Will drain you of your will to keep playing, and yet you will always return.DotA 2 Will make you regret ever playing it,  and yet you will always think ""Just one more game""DotA 2 Will take away all your free time, and yet you'll almost feel proud of how many hours you have in DotA 2.With the time you spend on this game, you could do all sorts. Study on learning a new set of skills to further your career. You could raise money for charity. You could be an aid worker for a foreign country and help improve the lives of others. You could even just play other games, you know, those ones sitting in your backlog, pushed aside by DotA 2. But you won't.You will always return to this game. The maximum you will learn from playing this game is how to insult others in various languages (mostly these languages will consist of Russian and Peruvian.). This game will become as much a part of your life as eating or blinking. Half the time you will not even remember having played DotA 2 on a certain day. It just becomes natural to you.If you start playing this game, you will become addicted.You will also spend obscene amounts of money on cosmetics. A quick chest purchase here, a few random items on the market there, and boom. Like me you'll have spent far too much on a game which needs no money spent on it. If you start DotA 2, not only will you be subjecting yourself to a motivation-destroying hobby, but also subjecting yourself to a wallet emptying one too.tl;dr This game will take away your time, money and patience for others. You will become an angry person.Basically 10/10 GOTY All years			",109,10,0,16,4,0,23

This game ruined my lifeI recommend everyone to play Dota 2 and not LoL nor HoN.Don't get me wrong, I am not hating or anything. I was from HoN for like 2-3 years before Dota 2 was released and tried LoL and actually enjoyed it for a bit but then went back to HoN.Dota 2 is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real.Dota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that..THE COMEBACKS ARE REAL!!!This game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten.All in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.P.S. Calm down, it's just a game...			",114,19,1,10,8,2,8

												I have been playing this game for 3 miserable years and 'm wrinting this review as an advice. To whom it may concern.. Uninstall this game and run for your life before its too late. Maybe the reader now giggling and drawing an image on his/her mind says this guy is a nerd. No im not, I'm a fitness guy with good shape studying engineering, which I had a social life in the past . I lost too much things on my life most of them are privacy/personal things not going to write them down but one of them is my education 24 years old still studying engineering because of this game.  If you are going to say that you can manage your day between playing ""DOTA"" and studying or working you are wrong because the average match time is 35 min *only 1 match. So 35 min × 3 games per day = 105 min. Not mentioning that some games exceed 1 hour if both teams played well. Please take this as an advice from 24 years old guy who has been suffering for 3 years because of this game I sucked on education you can be better than me and quit, I destroyed my dream and now im trying to bring it back wish me good luck.Please this is not a ""joke post"" and this advice aiming on teenagers who want to achieve their future dreams just don't play this game its ♥♥♥♥in AWESOME game but you have to pay your life for it.Your choice life or Dota and this is not a joke if you throw my words away just please save my comment on your favorites and come back after 3 years don't cry if your life got ruined.Save my comment if you don't want to take my advice you can visit this comment again.Most of positive reviews are written by Valve's agents believe me.

												Alright, listen up. Instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians, I'm going to tell you how Dota 2 really is at it's core.In a nutshell Dota 2 is a great game, but a terrible experience at the same time. You want to keep going back to it, but you also hate to go back. Why? One word: community. Dota 2's community is for the most part rude and hateful (and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own), sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting MOBA. It's unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake. Make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away... at the best of times. Often it's much worse and I would prefer not to go into the details. Sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you haven't actually done anything wrong. Occasionally, though, you come across friendly players, and when that happens, the game is a pure joy to play. However, since the game is 5v5, coming across four nice players at the same time (if you're solo queueing) is a rarity.Why then have I played the game for over 2000 hours? The sensation of winning. Your determination to keep playing, despite of the discouraging community, is fueled by the fantastic sensation of a glorious victory. That sweet moment when you see the enemy Ancient blow up and look back on the match, remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying. But even a victory can come with a grain of salt. Many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning. There is a mute option, but that doesn't stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat. People can intentionally feed the enemy team, ignore their own team, teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player. It's really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time.Going ranked doesn't really solve the problem either, at least not completely. Ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in Dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill. It feels much more professional and ""tryhardish."" Although you meet nice players more often, nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell. Having played some matches in ranked, I can say the mode isn't ""hate free."" I had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode. Another problem with ranked is that, like I said, it's more ""tryhard."" Many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and the ""this is ranked, you better be a damn good player"" mentality.But don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a great game in itself and that's why I keep going back to it. The core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well. No technical issues to speak of (not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so, of which I have had none myself). Graphics are great and have a subtle water painting type feel to them. All the various spells and abilites look great. The game is very deep and complex with tons of items, skill and item builds and strategies to learn. It can be a bit terrifying to beginners, but once you get the hang of things, it's engaging. All the playable heroes are well balanced (although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being ""OP"") and free to play from the start. That's another thing the game does right. All the heroes are free and playable from the start, unlike Dota 2's undeniably very successful competitor, League of Legends. Dota 2's microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff, which means there are zero ""pay to win"" elements in the game.It really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this brilliant game. If you're one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you, you have a better chance of not finding Dota 2 so terrible. To put it roughly in perspective: Playing Dota 2 is like playing Skyrim, but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make, calling you a ""fooping idiot"" every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective. Failed to kill Alduin? ""Uninstall Skyrim, noob."" Don't know how to make dragonbone armor? ""Learn to play, tard."" It would just completely sap the fun out of your epic adventures, would it not? Sadly that's how Dota 2's community is. Having played the game as long as I have, I would say that you are better off not playing Dota 2. The game is fun when you're winning (because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine), which is 50% of the time (and sometimes not even when you're winning). It isn't the losses that make the game unpleasant, it's the unfriendly people. Often your day will just be worse after playing Dota 2, instead of it cheering you up as games do. People will tell you that Dota 2 is great, but that greatness comes with a price.Do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view. This review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what it's really like, not just the great things. If you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis, then you're good to go. The game is at it's best when you play with friends and don't have to worry about getting ""a stick in the mud"" player on your team.Great game with bad community.			",89,8,1,7,5,0,8

												Dota 2 is the official sequel to the highly popular mod for Blizzard's Warcraft III, Defense of the Ancients. A mod that has been worked on by many, and therefore it was hard to determind where the rights belong. A lot of legal hocus pocus were going on between Blizzard and Valve last year, and it ended to valve's favor. The Dota name and franchise is now legally a part of Valve, probably thanks to the sneaky acquisition of IceFrog the year before.Dota 2 is a real-time strategy game in the sub-genre called MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena). A genre that has grown rapidly the past few years, with different type of alterations in favor of success. Dota 2 is a close second to being the most popular MOBA, right behind the giant League of Legends. Just like LoL, Dota 2 is gaining success throughout it's competetive e-sport scene, and it's clear that valve is highly pushing it towards the first position. The latest and biggest tournament was The International 2013, which included a total prize pool of over 2.8 million US dollars, which was the biggest prize pool in e-sport history.Gameplay is easy to understand but very hard to master. The map consists of 3 lanes that are constantly being pushed by NPC creeps. You are controlling a hero amongst 4 other in your team, and are fighting against 5 in the opposing team. The goal is to push your heroes and NPC creeps to the enemy base, where you have to destroy the ancient. It sounds pretty easy, but it requires hours upon hours to get a hold of the base mechanics, the more advanced mechanics and the professional mechanics. Plus the over 100 heroes you get to play and face.After 300 hours I have only touched what I call the more advanced mechanics, and I am not even close to professional level. The most experienced players have around 5000 hours of playtime and have spend the majority of their past 3 years to Dota 2. Since the game is Extremely competetive there will be a lot of curse words flying around while you play. These type of games are known for very hostile encounters with other players. There is an optional tutorial that you can take before going out there, beware though - the tutorial does not cover any Russian.Dota 2 might be competetive, extremely enraging and the learning curve is steep as crap, but it is still the game that I have spend the most time playing on Steam (mostly because my collegues and bosses were playing it). Somehow I keep returning to it, so I suppose I am enjoying it. You better have people to play with though, and you better not be good friends - because this game will take your beloved friendship and wipe it's♥♥♥♥♥with it until you hate each other.Only play this if you plan on getting some mental disorder. Time will fly, and you will realize you still suck and people hate you no matter what. It's free so why do you need a review anyway?Translations: German ",2206,881,113,298,314,29,428

												I originally played Dota when it was merely a UMS on WC3, so take this review for what it's worth. Dota 2 is an addictive experience; however, this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society. If that statement is an insufficient description of the game, continue reading.This game is not for the casual gamer, this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game.If you play this game, I can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard. I have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play, no matter what you do, you will encounter someone who will complain about something you're doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you. I can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with.So here are what I consider the pros and cons of the game:Pros-This is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing.-Free to play with optional cosmetic costs.-Gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection. This, in effect, increases replayability tremendously.-Wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer.-Winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more. This in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game.Cons-This game has a steep learning curve, believe me, there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance. Unlike hero customization in League of legends, not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either. It can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection, but thus is DOTA.-Secondary to the steep learning curve, games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team. This can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of ""fundamentals of gameplay"" video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have. Suffice to say, many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team, the player loses gold and the other team gains gold. This doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay. -Unlike other video game developers, Steam does not region lock. This brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference. You can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when there's a Russian only speaker, Spanish only speaker and a Portuguese only speaker on the US WEST server. -Blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in America. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst aspect of the game. The game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future. More often than not, an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions.-There is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 10-20 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier.This review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary. Of course, if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person, be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy. Final Rating: -Game 9/10-Game community 3/10			",47,7,0,7,6,0,5

												I've always wanted to go to Russia. To learn the culture, eat and drink and see the sights. But I cannot do that, as it is expensive and I'm busy doing my uni work.But then I found Dota 2. This free learning course teaches you all about Russians and their culture. I can even speak decent Russian! However, these Russian people can get quite angry and annoying. They often shout the phrase ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; and bring you to the depths of insanity. I got forced to drink my sorrows away during the beginning of the course, but it was worth it in the end.If you don't have the time and money to travel to Russia, I'd suggest you pick up Dota 2. A fantastic learning resource.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You awaken in a cold room. You are naked, and shivering. Looking up from your bed of damp straw, you can just make out what seems to be the Peruvian flag hung from the celing. There is a pistol on a small table near by. For some reason, you are drawn to it. It calls to you like a siren's song. You put it in your mouth, the gunmetal tastes so sweet.

												I have played Dota 2 for a little over three years now, so I think I am finally ready to give it an in depth review. I gave this game a review back in 2013, but I am going to change that. First of all, I'm going to start by listing off what I like about the game.::THE PROS::1) Dota 2 is, obviously, a team game. Playing this game with friends is a really fun experience and can act as a source of really fantastic memories. My point is, if you play this game with a group of four other friends, Dota 2 is probably one of the best options out there.2) Dota 2 has a fantastic tutorial system and the game is very well designed to accomodate new players. A new player can go from a full AI game to an AI game with 4 other random people to playing a 5v5 online; the transition is really smooth.3) I have played both League and Dota, and I can honestly say that I think that Dota 2 is much more visually pleasing to look at. A smooth, clean UI makes the game easier on the eyes compared to League's cartoon-y design (which suits some, but not me).4) Dota has an extremely vast pool of heroes that can be played to suit almost anyone's playstyle. After you play Dota for awhile, you can pick out the heroes that really fit your playstyle and excel at them through ranked matchmaking. It's damn near impossible to be bad at literally every hero. The large hero pool (100+) allows for THOUSANDS of different lineup possibilities, meaning every game has the chance to be completely new and different than anything you've played before.5) Honestly, Dota 2 is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. No; it is THE most addicting game I have ever played. As a full-time student, I still have managed to rack up 2,500 hours in this game in my free-time. Especially back when I was a new player, I played this game all the time.However. I am actually changing my review of this game from positive to negative. Let me tell you why.::THE CONS::1) Here's my biggest flaw with the game. I absolutely hate -- I MEAN HATE -- Valve's regional matchmaking. Before finding a match, the player is supposed to change server preferences to the closest server(s) to the members of the party, and they are supposed to choose the appropriate language preference. For example, as an American player, it is expected that you choose U.S. West and U.S. East as your servers, with English as your language preference. And, generally, Americans follow this rule. HOWEVER. In almost every game I play now, I get a Peruvian or Brazilian or someone from South East Asia in my games. Hopefully it makes sense to the readers of this review that you should not be finding a match in the United States if you live in Asia. You lag, and become actually useless in the game. The South Americans, though, spam in their native languages and constantly flame. Am I generalizing? Honestly, no. I'm really not. If you are good at Dota 2, you would and should queue for games for which you are prepared to play at your best. Valve has no form of region lock on matchmaking (they really can't, due to international professional teams), and while it's really not Valve's fault, I just wish there was some way to reliably play with four people from your country and/or language. This is seriously Dota 2's biggest flaw, because so much of every game revolves around the synergy and cooperation among teammates. This is literally impossible when someone spends the entire game flaming you in a different language. I'm honestly not trying to be discriminatory in any way; this is just how Dota is in reality and is likely never to change. I have become so fed up with this poor form of matchmaking that I have actually, finally, uninstalled the game.2) Dota has actually no reliable way to punish feeders. Sure, you and your team can use the report system (you only have a limited number of reports by the way, so after you expend them on flamers or feeders you are out of luck and have to enlist the other team and your teammates to waste their reports on the other feeders and flamers). The feeder may get put in low priority, but it honestly teaches them nothing. We have all been in low prio at one point or another, and we come out unchanged. Valve needs to implement a way to correct this. I'm not alone in my view on this either. Even professional player Secret.Puppey voiced his opinion the other day, which is very similar to mine. Punishments need to become more severe.3) The Dota 2 community is actually cancerous. If you are not playing in a 5-stack of friends, I can almost promise you that you will very rarely, if ever, get on a team where all 5 teammates are willing to cooperate and play as a coordinated team. Almost every single game, someone on your team will flame someone else for sucking really bad, mostly because they probably did. But people speak so hatefully towards one another that it really feels like an unwelcoming scene. One of the professional Dota casters (joinDota's ""Capitalist"") tweeted the other day that he loses so much respect for pro players in pubs because they spend so much time flaming and tilting. This is actually about 90% of the Dota community, actually, not just the professionals. Everyone has this weird god complex where they are convinced they are better than everyone on the server, even if they got no kills and fed unimaginably badly.4) This kind of ties in with the points I have made previously. It is almost impossible to single-handedly win a game if your team is playing very poorly. Thus, the entire game comes down to teamwork; and most Dota players are unreliable teammates who will either feed or flame (90%, roughly, like I said). The 10% of people who don't flame are the people who are actually in professional teams (and while they flame in pubs, they synergize well in their professional settings (unless you are kuro and rtz)).5) Dota is really bad for your health unless you have a godly amount of self control. If you win a game, you can end happy. But if you lose a game, you keep playing and keep losing and it becomes very depressing and frustrating. The garbage community gets in your head, and it's just bad.Look, honestly, I fully expect to continue to follow the professional Dota scene. Dota really is one of the best games out there and it's especially fun to watch the pros play. But, if you are looking for a MOBA that you can regularly enjoy, then you are better off playing StarCraft II, which is where I am headed now. Don't get me wrong, though; Dota 2 is still much better than League of Legends and I would never suggest League of Legends to anyone unless they are really, really struggling with Dota 2. I won't be returning to Dota until Valve makes some much needed changes to the game, or at least until I have had a long, much-needed break from the seriously draining community that Dota offers.TL;DR: It's a good MOBA, better than LoL, but too many community & matchmaking issues to make this worth a positive. Gave me a great 3 years of entertainment though. Play SCII.Rating: 7/10Good game, for awhile. But community is horrible.			",103,17,2,9,16,2,15

Personally Am trying my best to play a lot less because of life responsibilities. Suggest watching rather than playing if you are time poor. Some players can be toxic (ie. Rude or angry). Suggest muting them for an enjoyable experience			",13,1,0,8,0,0,3

												Dota 2 is like an abusive relationship. It's not good for you, but you go back to it anyways because it's addicting. You'll lose a game, feel bad, play again, then if you win you'll feel just content. If you lose again, you'll play again. Repeat. There are good moments, there are bad moments, but most of all there are non-english speakers in english servers.

												A great game with a very friendly and tolerant community, its also a very educational and cultural experience. Since I've been playing dota I've learned to speak russian and spanish, Who needs rosetta stone when you have dota right? The russians are so friendly and have a neat little nickname for americans called ""Suukah"", I think it means comrade or friend. And the peruvians are so helpful, for instance I was mid as pudge and at the start of the match a peruvian dazzle came mid with me and stayed with for about 11 minutes, He helped me out by taking the last hits and first blood. He said ""movimiento♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;, I think it means ""I got your back"", What a nice guy. Dota is great and all but there are a few problems with some heros, like bloodseeker, Phantom Assassin, Faceless void, And huskar. They need to be buffed, I find them extrememly underwhelmed. Bloodseekers ult cd is just too long and needs to be lowered to ten seconds, Phantom assassin needs a higher crit ratio, faceless needs more evasion and movement speed, and huskar's flaming spear should cost no hp. Oh and there's one other hero needs to be nerfed hard, Bat rider is just too overpowered and unbalanced. I think he has too much hp, and the base should be lowered to 320, also lower his base movement speed to 200. Aside from those few problems dota 2 is the best FPS I have ever played in my life.

												After 3.2k hours why no? The community is too much to handle.  Great game, unlimited depth/strategy but the devs make no effort to deal with an increasingly toxic and hostile community.  The game relies on teamwork which means it only takes 1 @sshole to ruin a 45 minute match for everybody that puts in the work. And there's no shortage of em out there.EDIT:You guys are right its not fair to blame developers. They produced a great product with a great engine and they made it free. I wrote the review in frustration. The fact that the game is good enough to draw emotion out of people is a great thing...its just reached a point where 1 out of 10 games were good games without someone dropping, trolling or what have you. I'm not saying I have the answer to fix things, or that I could personally develop a better product. What I am saying (to answer the not reccomended question) is that I wish I had spent the time doing something else, in retrospect and that if someone randomly asked me if I've played any good games recently....Dota wouldn't make the list.To end things on a positive note, imagine this kind of game with a macro mechanic where despite what happens during the match, its of some benefit to the bigger picture game. GLHF all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dota 2 is sequel to critically acclaimed hat trading sim, Team Fortress 2. What Valve has managed to do with hats is astounding. They've improved upon everything that the original had to offer, and then they kicked it up a notch.  Imagine a world where everyone and every thing has a hat. Now imagine that you can become THAT hat. You are the weapon, you are the bullet, you are the sword edge. That's immersion on a new level. Never before has an experience been this good.I recommend this to anyone who has ever, or will ever dream of hat, hats, or hat accesories. If you haven't yet, you need to experience this. Go do it. Now.11/10 Hats, it's all right.2016 Update: I haven't touched this game in 2+ years and there's a reason for that; I'm too busy wearing and showing off my hats. Great hats/10			",185,32,0,14,19,1,39

												There is fine line between bravery and stupidity - Juggernaut.Going into DotA 2 is crossing this line. You've got to be brave to even consider playing it in the first place. If you stay here longer than 2 hours, then I'm sorry but you're stupid. So am I. Because this game, as enraging it can be, is also really enjoyable experience. If you want to be constantly surprised by game, developers and other players, and there is inner drive of self-improvement in you it's game for you. Even if, at the end of the day, you suspect yourself of masochistic tendencies, just try it.			",109,13,0,15,7,0,30

												After wasting my +2000 hours on it, i think i can say something about this game.First of all, this review is not a humorous one. I'm writing it seriously to give information about this game. Because it is so popular and too many people want to learn something about it including who has never played it and starters. I think this review will be informative for these people, gamers who has spent couple of hours like me, knows everything i am going to try to tell.After this short introduction, we can start:-Russians' problem is not about being Russian. Due to the game's popularity among Russian players, there are too many bad (always swears, doesnt play as its a team game, doesnt speak english in eu servers etc.) Russian players. But there are also too many nice Russian players. Briefly, the problem is not about being Russian, if there are 10 gamers in dota, 4 of them will be bad players, if there are 1000, 400 of them. Thats the point.-If you want to play this game to get relaxed, dont do it. After few matches you will find yourself more depressed, angry or sick instead of relaxed or enjoyed. The bad players are the reason for it. As an illustriation; you started a game to get enjoyed, looked the picks, someone rushed carry heroes without saying anything and suddenly said ""me mid"" or ""me solo"" etc., ok thats right you are still relax, you picked a support for your team, they somehow fed the enemies, ok still you are relaxed, they started to argue with each other, they started to swear and fed the enemy team on purpose just because of their arguement, ok you are still trying to convince them to stop it but you feel angry, and then you will lose the game. This type of games are not so rare in dota. 3 over 10 games are being played according to this nutshell. Therefore, it is highly possible that you will find yourself in a very bad mood instead of enjoyed after playing dota.-Then, why people still playing it too much? Why there is not just bad players in the community now? Because it is addictive. You can not get rid of it. If someone trolls your game, you want to play again and wish to play with better players, if you win the game, you want to win again and increase your mmr, if you lose the game you want to play again to get your mmr back. Shortly, you will want to play again after every game. However, if you are sure that you can stop playing whenever you want, this reason is pointless for you.-Meaningless mmr system. When i first heard about mmr system i was quite excited. Because it ideally provides an environment that includes less trolls and bad players. However, the system is completely meaningless. Player profile and skills are same at 1k,2k and 3k mmr. Once you get your mmr, it is very hard to increase it too much since every win increase it 25, every lose decrease it 25 and as i said before, player profile is same at 1k 2k and 3k, when you have a bad player in your team it is nearly impossible to win that game etc. It is completely up to your team. So, how people get too high mmr's? They have this mmr at the begining. And how they did it? There is no clear information about it. Valve does not announce how it is being calculated. For example, i played 10 first ranked games with 8 wins, i played support and carries, buy wards and couriers when i was support, i carried the game almost on my own when i was carry, but my mmr was 2200 when some people get 4k starting mmr. This system also a fact about this game's addiction but doesn't help kind players about creating a better environment.-All in all, i dont recommend this game just because of its community. The game is a master piece, master of MOBAs, it is a great thing that only you can spend your money on cosmetic items in the game, it has great graphics etc. However, it has a really bad community and you will find yourself as one of those bad players when you play more and more and it becomes impossible to get rid of it. On the other hand, if you have a great mental power and patience, play it, i completely recommend it. This review was written for normal patience leveled people. I dont say ""Dont waste your time, go and do some social activities"", if u want to play video games, dont play it go and play more enjoying games.-Lastly, i have an advice for valve, it would be better if there will be an administrator system in dota. People who works professionally and for money for this administrator job would examine players' matches who get reports too much and if they see that they are bad players (as defined at the beginning) they should be banned from game for few days or their mmrs should be decreased. Now, it is done completely automatic and so after some low priority matches bad players can continue trolling. I hope it would be helpful for people who hasnt spent too much time on dota and it would be read by people except from my friends :D************************Some Suggestions************************I wrote this review when this game made me feel so bad and desperate. I lost my will to play dota. However then, thanks to some sensitive comments, I started to play dota only with my friends. Now I have some suggestions for people who have similar feelings about dota as I mentioned in my review months ago.-As some people say in comments of this review, play this game with your friends. After writing this review I have rarely played solo games and it feels better.-Participate in some tournaments. After lots of bad pub match experiences, that tournament atmosphere offers a great dota experience. You can participate in ESL's or other platforms' open tournaments for free.-Finally,never give up! You can encounter very kind players as well. After a bad pub game performance, your teammates maybe say ""uninstall dota"" etc. but after then you can participate in tournaments with your friends. Just do not give any importance what they say. You can see similar things in this review's comments section. There are very kind, sensitive and suggestive comments which try to help me and lots of depressing, offensive comments. Same is true for the player profile in dota, just dont give any importance what the haters say! ***Final Note***For the guys who say ""why don't u recommend the game while playing it too much"", please read the review again, this review is a complete answer to your question.GOOD LUCK & HAVE FUN :DUNFORTUNATELY, IO LOST THE ARCANA SHOWDOWN  (2015) :(UNFORTUNATELY, IO LOST THE ARCANA SHOWDOWN AGAIN , BUT THIS TIME AT FINAL STAGE (2016) :(Edited: Game hours are updated and some grammar mistakes are corrected. ""Some Suggestions"" section added. Thank you all for suggestions, comments and rate ups. Final Note section added. Io's arcana showdown adventure expanded.			",61,6,1,1,8,1,6

												After nearly 6000 games, which means ~ 20000 unique teammates and 25000 unique opponents, I can personally certify and guarantee that at least 80% of these people are not worthy of the air they breathe or the water they drink. This game is a testament to how the vast majority human beings possess selfishness beyond limits and stupidity beyond measure. The community of this game is evidence that we truly live with a ""coddled generation"" of children who were raised to believe that they are special and unique and superior to all other people and can literally do no wrong. The vast majority of people who play this game would benefit greatly from having the♥♥♥♥♥♥beaten out of them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR: DOTA < beer < self-improvement. + You will curse the day you pressed that ""install"" button.Okay, listen. If you are a competetive person, enjoy breaking your limits and achieving goals - don't even think of installing this game. JUST DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING DO IT.Try learning how to play guitar, salsa dancing, Java programming, anything. But not DOTA. Because after 3-4 years of playing and more than 4k matches you wiil feel the same♥♥♥♥♥♥I feel now. It is regret. You will regret all that time you wasted on a computer game that gave you nothing back. Don't get me wrong, this is a great game. It is perfectly designed, it provides an incredibly wide range of emotions. BUT! You will eventually understand, that you could have used all that precious time to make yourself a better human being and already conquire this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ world. Instead of hitting creeps, destroying towers and raging on teammates.You might think of e-sport at some point. But game is not worth the candle. Just sit down and calculate chances yourself if you are seriously considering earning money playing it.If you just want to chill at weekends with friends playing a few matches - go for it, this is a great way to do it. But if I were you I would go to a nearby bar and find a good company and some adventures instead, it is far more interesting and profitable.Not recommended.EDIT: Nice discussion in comments. Read through it if interested.			",46,4,1,1,6,0,5

												Thank you for reading this.This is how I lost my faith in humanityThis is how I think what's DotA2 in many people's eyesIt's ALWAYS happening in every one or two gamesBlame your support ✓Blame your carry ✓Blame your teammate if you're losing ✓Blame your enemy if your teammates are your friends ✓Pause then unpause automatically ✓Boast when you're winning even if you're feeding the entire time ✓EZ Most annoying word, especially if you're doing nothing and others supporting/carrying you ✓I know it's not anyone's fault it's like thisBut Valve please?Can you fix the community?Give them something harsh punishmentThis kind of things are just like cyberbullying.. Made someone depressedI know I know it's just a ""game"" right?But you can see the effects for the peopleThey're unleashing negative energy to other people so they can unleash it to other people again until this community became the most Toxic communityI mean seriously 10 years ago, DotA community just not that bad.. It's friendly in fact!Maybe it's because everyone's learning? And trying to learn together is fun? Teaching one and another, made a DotA's friendly communityBut now the community, almost made everyone sick of itValve, please give them a proper & harsh punishment so they won't repeat their wrongdoing again & againI just saw too many wrong things, but no proper responses from ValveI know Valve just want to make money and more moneyBut please.. Can't you at least give some attention to your games?I know Valve can't count until 3, so this will be the last gameAt least make it a good memory for all the playersHere's a very simple thing for example, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ""Thank you"" truly from their heart?""Thank you for supporting us""""Thank you for carrying us""""Thank you for hanging in there""""Thank you for handling the mid nicely""""Thank you for buying us wards & courier""""Thank you for teaching me where I did wrong""Or something like thatIt's ok everyone's fail at one timeNot everyone's perfect""You're doing a good job!""Have you ever done that?Have you ever heard that?No?Well that's Dota 2 community for youDid you imagine how Dota 2 is now if all of people that playing Dota 2 have done that?At least more enjoyable to play.. right?Well reality is cruelIf you want to start play this game I don't recommend it playing with peopleI don't even recommend to play this game with your friends.. It's bad enough that it'll make you lost your friends... (or is it a good thing because you'll know they're fake friends or not?)Most of them are bad people, don't have manner or even humanityYou can play it with bots though, they're more encouraging & friendlier to newbie playersPlease for your sakeStay away from this gameEspecially from the communityOne of many proofs

												Dota 2 is quickly becoming the most played game on Steam, and for good reason. The blend of well-balanced multiplayer, infinite replayability, gorgeous aesthetics, and the time and care Valve has put in to support the community is a recipe for perfection. I simply cannot reccomend Dota 2 enough.The game boasts a roster of over a hundred heroes, and each one feels unique and well-designed. In any given match, you take control of a singular hero, and victory or defeat hinges not only on how well you play that hero, but how also on how well you synergize with your five person team.Unfortunately, the barrier of entry is high. Quite a lot of research, preparation, and knowledge is required to be sucessful, and it can be frustrating losing repeatedly. However, tutorials are available to guide new players, and the time spent learning only adds to the satisfaction of landing a five-man Black Hole or pulling off that perfect Blink-Poof combo.Spectacularly enough, the battlefield is not the only area where the game shines. Dota TV is an in-game spectator mode that allows the option to watch professional teams play in tournaments, including the multi-million dollar International that Valve hosts on a yearly basis.And all of this for free. There are cosmetic items that can be used to customize your favorite hero, however nothing availble changes gameplay in any way. They are mostly designed by members of the community and can be purchased or recieved randomly while playing.Content patches and new heroes are being added all the time. Dota 2 will continue to grow for years, hopefully continuing to find new players interested in a fast-paced online multiplayer experience that is equal parts exhilirating and engaging.

												As a colourblind user, the HUD has completely screwed me over. I'm having difficulty to differentiate between greyed out skills/items and coloured (readied) ones.The HUD itself is poorly implemented. A lot of crucial features is missing unless you press alt, which just further distracts me from the gameplay.I dunno. I see their point on making the HUD more snappy/intuitive, but its a step back for me			",265,49,31,25,40,5,50

												Dota 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, MOBA for short. In Dota 2 is a pure free-to-play game, which means that you don't have to unlock heroes, maps or other stuff. The only way to be good at Dota 2 is to know the game. You need to know every single item and hero to become a really good player. And that's the reason i like this game so much. However, this can be a problem for new players. You don't know anything about the game when you spawn in your base with 4 teammates.So, what is this game all about? Well, you play as one of the 105 available heroes and you have to destroy the enemy base. Sounds easy right? Well, to do that you have to fight your way through towers, creeps and of course the other team. At the start of the game you just stay in your 'lane' and farm and harass enemies by attacking or even ganking them. After this 'laning stage' is completed, your team and the enemy team will face eachother in so called 'teamfights'. After a while, one team will have a large gold and experience advantage, and they will push to the other teams base. And then of course destroy it.Verdict---------I really enjoyed and still enjoy this game. Dota 2 isn't a pay-to-win game, which makes this game much more enjoyable. Dota 2 also has the best eSports support, you can easily watch a match and select one of the several Broadcasters to make watching eSport matches more enjoyable. The only downside of Dota 2 is the fact that you'll need a lot of knowledge to be good at this game.If you manage to survive all the mean teammates and learn everything about the game, you'll easily spend 200 hours on Dota 2. If not, you'll quit within 20 hours.Score: 91/100			",191,22,2,31,5,3,16

												I used to play LoL, and sunk  more money into that game than I care to admit.  The great thing about DotA, is EVERY hero is unlocked from the start.  LoL has a limited selection of free champions every week, which is fine, but your options are limited during drafting.  I found myself buying champs that were popular in the current meta just to compete.  I haven't played LoL in months since getting into DotA, how can I?  This game is so much more complex (which is daunting at first), but the more you learn and play the better it gets.  Every day I learn something new, I try a new hero or two, and it's awesome.Highly recommend checking out http://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2 as well as http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dota_2_Wiki .http://www.devilesk.com/dota2/apps/interactivemap2/ is a great map.I may have spent more time watching gameplay vids/strats and tournaments than actually playing the game!  The in game spectating client is very well done, it even has casters!LoL is just... lol! It doesn't compare...			",197,31,1,32,16,3,36

I especially enjoy it when super awesome pro players stream the games to twitch and say that their 5 viewers are laughing at me. Classic banter.

												I've spent 10 years and almost 10,000 hours playing Warcraft III DotA as well as Dota 2, and loved playing it. I've met many interesting people, fought epic battles, snatched victory from the jaws of defeat through several Herculean efforts, endured many soul crushing defeats, and even clashed with a handful of professional players. The game has changed drastically over my many years of playing, but as of about a year ago, the game became too frustrating to continue, and as I continue to watch, I am saddened by what the game has become.For years my friends and I have joked about the ""League-ification"" of Dota. Dota has always been the epitome of hyper competitive cooperative gameplay, with a high emphasis on individual skill and decision making at all phases of the game, especially in punishing poor decisions. Pushing a tower alone with nobody showing on the map? Get back or you're dead. Hard carry dies past 40 minutes without buyback? That's a barracks down. Pick crappy laning heroes? Welcome to hell while the enemy team runs a trilane and pushes barracks at 20 minutes.Our jokes slowly but surely became a reality. Teleport scrolls were reduced in cost, meaning everybody rolled around with a handful because they weren't a financial burden. Ways to gain gold were increased, so supports could afford to have a handful of items in the mid game. The rubber band effect was introduced, and pushing strategies were neutered. You pick a lineup to take towers and take one unfavorable engagement and the game's over, whereas previously the greedier lineup would have to do more work than a single fight to overcome the gold advantage. The cost of boots was reduced, taking boots first strategies from a sure sign that you were bad to a viable strategy. Strong laners also got pushed out. Dominating the early game became effectively irrelevant as killing giant money bag heroes in the midgame would slingshot the trailing team into the lead.The worst casualty has been the versatility of the game. Metas change and stuff goes in and out of favor, that's fine and fair, but certain aspects have become imperative to have. A support with a hard save, a hard carry that can fight in the early mid game. Bad laning heroes can just be sent mid, while traditional skill mid heroes are just sent to the safelane. When you take a big lead, the plan is almost always just farm out the map until you can't possibly lose when taking the high ground, as taking a risk will not just result in you losing a fight, but most likely the lead.The game that I grew up with that punishes the smallest mistakes is a distant memory, and we are left with a mid game brawler. I wish Dota 2 the best as it progresses, but the core mechanics have been changed so drastically that I can neither play nor watch it without feeling like something that was once an unrelenting niche game has been formed to cater to the whims of the massive casual audience that it has attracted.

												This is the best MOBA game ever made, simply a masterpiece, but also has one of the worst communities. I sometimes end up frustrated, tired and in a bad mood when i can't win a single game in 6 hours of straight gameplay just because of bad players who get in your games to ruin them. Theyre're not just noobs, they just love trolling and ****ing up others people fun.If you're noob and wish to play Dota, make sure you have patience and time. Becoming good in this game is really hard, takes years to master and you'll never get to call yourself a pro. If you decided to start Dota, DO NOT play online. Practice with bots first, read guides, read items and abilities descriptions first, you got to study before playing in a real game with humans. It can be very frustrating for old players to deal with people that simple come to ''try out'' a new game into their matches and ruin them. Please. Someday you will realize what i mean with this.I play DotA since 2007 (Dota 1) and I have hit my keyboard, laughed, yell'd to my girlfriend for no reason and even let my bad mood affect my scores in school because instead of studying math, I decided to stay late playing and made me lose time I could spend with friends. Lost many good stuff I could have done out-game because I said ''One more match...'' which became 10 more matches... and ended up totally frustrated without winning one of them, unable to sleep well those nights. Due to this, to the careless community and the fact that your mood can be affected by DotA and how it makes you feel, i can't recommend this game.Dota is not just another game to your library. You have to be very careful when you decide to play this.			",69,6,2,6,2,0,3

												At this point in time, I've wasted round 3-5 years of my life playing this game.It's a small amount compared to the hours that my peers and teammates have amassed, even I, who had started when beta was released to the general public. A good chunk of the gaming population has played it at least once, or have heard of it, or am still playing even as type this review out.Anywho, let's talk about Dota.Dota 2 is not a game; it's a major time sink. You spend the first 100-200 games improving your gameplay to be even called ""below average"", whilst losing horribly in every single one. You will weep. Burst in an outrage. Asking yourself why did you ever choose to play this game in the first place.Every single game roughly consists of 40-50 mins that you give all your efforts to be returned with a fleeting feeling of joy. Bliss. Or the soul crushing depression of losing the past 10 games during the weekend - the times you turned down your friends at a night out to play this game.It's not because Dota is hard. No, no. It's not the mechanics that you have fine-tuned yourself in being able to do over and over a 100 times without messing up. In my words, it could very well be as easy as playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure or as ball crushing hard as playing Dark Souls with no proper equipment - simply because the game boils down to one thing:Teamwork. Synergy between people, how they cooperate, willingly or not. More often at times you're going to have the most disillusioned people with a lexicon of a drunk jaded middle-aged man who's going through a mid life crisis rather than the quiet, reserved player who tries his/her best in assisting your efforts in a win.It can be argued that the game can be won single-handedly by a skilled player, but it's a pipe dream to seek that out, for most of the general population - but it does not deter them from doing so, which leads to yet another problem/frustration within the game. People seek glory within it; they yearn the temporary recognition it brings, and those players put their teammates beneath them, which ultimately loses them the game. In short there are a lot of different reasons and expectations of the game, which may cause conflicts ultimately losing you the game. Save yourself the trouble and do something else.Edit -  For those of you who cant math for some reason, 4k hours over 4 years is roughly 3 games a day assuming its a game is an hour on average.

												When I was young, I started to suffer from a major crack addiction. This was becoming a real problem. after telling a friend about my struggle with narcotics, he suggested I played this crazy game called DOTA 2. I spent some of my crack money on a new computer so I could play this game. The more I played, the more it started to attract me. In the end, I realised that this game was a much healthier substitute to crack cocaine. I gave up crack last year, never looked back. Now I waste my life away playing DOTA 2 instead.10/10 Saved my life			",12,0,1,2,0,0,1

												Comrades, it is time to rejoice. The cult classic Communist adventure saga continues with the newest installment of the series, Downfall of the Americans 2: Stalin's Revemge. Featuring the original cast of Stalin and all of his closest friends, including Russian Bear, Dr. Vodka, and Krokodealer, this game is a must have for the whole village. Destroy filthy American Strongholds to spread wealth to all of your comrades, use teamwork to crush the American scum, and lead your comrades to victory. Feel as though you are on a whole different level than your peers? Play ranked matches to realize that you suck just as much as they do. Looking for an easy game to boost morale? Enter a bot match to fight Americans as they should be percieved: easy to find and easy to kill. The game even features collectable hats to help your characters survive the harsh winter.

												ALERT: All this was written before the recent matchmaking change. I cannot say anything for the current set of changes yet, but I observe with hopefully eccentric anticipations.6k hours and 5k mmr....yet I had to quit. The community is terrible and nothing is done but improve matters. People feed 5 games in a row, and then create a new account when they get ""low priority"" on the previous one. Mixed with all the recent patches transforming the game into a much easier game, which is a pro if you're new, but ultimately becomes a con if you continue playing consistently.There are 3 ""MMR"" (matchmaking rating) scores in the game - your solo and party MMR, which check how solid you perform in a solo and a team environment, but there is also a hidden third ""MMR"", visible only by opening the console and typing:""developer 1""""dota_game_account_debug"" (all without "")This score for example tracks  how ""friendly"" you are. It is a 0-10.000 score, 0 being cancer and 10k being the friendliest person on the Earth, and the score should award you with more friendly players in the team. HOWEVER, abandoning a single game decreases this score so hard that you need like a month to regain it. Now, game ruiners who feed intentionally, flame and then get punished by having to play a certain (usually 5) number of games in the ""low priority"" quene, in the current patch I'm writing for which is 7.05 CANNOT be reported in low prio. That means that you can feed 1000 games in a row by going 0-50 and your friendliness score will INCREASE because you're getting no reports. In League of Legends, should you feed like 10 games in a row, you would get permabanned. Here...nothing.The community is awful and honestly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Do you know one drill sergeant in the army who's a friendly guy and isn't an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? Yeah, that's the likehood of finding a friendly player in this community, especially in ranked matchmaking. FINAL THOUGHTS: Should you start playing this game, it will become a black hole which sucks in all your time, health and money but does not reward you with anything...except wasted time. Just think about it - how many hours do you need to complete a university semester? And how many hours you need to reach 6k-7k mmr to somehow transform this game into a business? Think about it... and once you get bored of the game, after having spent thousands of hours (like most Dota players), you will realize how well you've spent the ONLY life you have. We all create our fate - choose wisely.			",60,2,3,4,6,0,25

												Dota 2 ranks among few titles that can be classified as truly free-to-play.  While many other titles label themselves with this distinction, there are often convenience purchases or some form of power available for real money transactions.  While Dota 2 has an extensive cash shop, all offerings are completely cosmetic.  HUD options, voice packs and character costumes form the basis of a store lacking even an iota of power or convenience for purchase.  All gameplay elements are absolutely free and do not require collection or usage of any kind of in-game currency.Once a player has determined that they’re ready to commit to a steep learning curve and potential negative interactions with teammates (Again, learn with friends to reduce this aspect), Dota 2 is incredibly enjoyable and possibly one of the best multiplayer games ever made.  Every match is different, and watching perfect team fight execution is gaming art.  Players have access to a huge range of hero styles and the interactions between teammates and foes are incredibly diverse.  It’s twenty to forty-five minutes of gladiatorial bliss, the end result carefully orchestrated from the first enemy tap to the final crushing blow.Dota 2 can be experienced and enjoyed at multiple levels of engagement, and it’s a title that rewards users for a deep dive.  Heavy investment, heavy reward.  The barrier to entry isn’t quite as bad as it was years ago, but it would be disingenuous to say that the game doesn’t have a colossal learning curve.  As a free-to-play title readily available on Steam, it offers players a frictionless doorway – but the challenge may be keeping new players interested and willing to commit to the epic journey that is learning, playing, and enjoying Dota 2.The game is in a strong place right now. It’s rewarding and sociable like few other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. The next few months will be crucial: it’s currently the best expression of Valve’s progressive attitude towards players, and if it can continue on that track it describes a future for online gaming that is far more hopeful than the one we’re used to.Just remember to spend your starting cash, and make sure someone buys the courier. Oh, and when Riki starts showing up in your games, just get some Sentry Wards down and don't run away. Also, you always want a Bottle when in mid-lane, and runes spawn at 0:00 and again every two minutes. Practice last-hitting before you go online. And if you're jungling, memorise where the low-level Creeps are.Actually, you know what? Forget all that. Just have fun.4 out of 5			",645,142,31,79,97,12,138

												Imagine, for a moment, that it is Christmas morning. Your home is abuzz with laughter, and the smell of fresh baked goods drifts up from downstairs. You race to the tree, and begin to open a beautiful present, adorned with festive colors and a wrapping scheme that is both dauntingly complex yet also simple in its execution. You turn to your mother, father, and two siblings and smile; for you know that your adventure into opening your gift is about to begin. You go to open your unwrapped box, and BWONG.. A horn bellows, deafening you. Out of the box pops a small, dwarf-like figure, wielding a multicultural bat festooned with Ecuadorian and Peruvian patterns, and of Russian construction. ""THANKS FOR STANDING STILL, GANKER,"" he shrieks, as he wallops young brother Timmy in the teeth. Your mother tuts and scolds him, for being out of position. The dwarf darts under the tree, looking for a hole in the wall to continue his pursuit of rat-DOTA. ""Gank him,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!"" your father roars, as he sits on the couch lazily and watches. You crawl, desperate for your gift of victory over the rat, under the tree, and he continues to elude you. Suddenly, with a flourish, he produces a lighter, and proceeds to methodically burn down your house while muttering ""GG 2 EZ"", and your family sits in the living room muttering ""garbage team"" and ""reported"". Your family home burns down around them, and only you escape the engulfing flames, accompanied by the chortles of the dwarf. Downtrodden but not easily bested, you begin your walk down the street to your friend's house, in the hopes that by having Christmas at their house, you might be able to somehow catch the multicultural dwarf on the second try.10/10 Best fun and Peruvian simulator.

												If you're looking for a League of Legends clone, look elsewhere; if you're looking for a MOBA that you can play for a couple weeks or even months and become good at, look elsewhere. I've been playing Dota 2 for around 10 years since it was DotA, the Warcraft III custom map and I'll tell you right now there's still a lot of room for personal improvement. This game boils down to far more than individual skill, tactics, and teamwork/cooperation. The author of ""Three Lane Highway"" (see pcgamer.com) has called Dota an ""isometric wizard-em up"" game, and I think it's fitting. There are so many aspects to this game, so many factors that control the outcome that if you try and sit down and list them all it'll take you a couple hours. And you'll still miss some. I have played pretty much every single ""Multi-player Online Battle Arena"" on the market, and no matter how interesting they are or what different elements they try to bring to the gameplay, I always end up coming back to Dota. If you want to seriously challenge yourself, and you have the will and motivation to work towards a lofty goal that many are unable to reach, this is the game for you.			",88,7,0,24,9,0,5

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			",17,2,0,2,0,0,0

												Ah, my DotA. You are my bliss and you are my sorrow. Sometimes I wonder how I would feel if I had not met you on that day all those years ago. Would I be a happier or a sadder man than I am now? What is certain is that of all the games I have played, I have spent more time with none other than you. For those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, let me introduce you to Dota 2, Valve's faithful sequel to a game that can most easily be described to the uninitiated as a mix between the RTS and RPG genres. The game consists of two 5-man teams with each player choosing a unique hero and fighting to destroy the opposing team's throne. It sounds simple enough, but once you mix in the seemingly myriad number of heroes to choose from, the race to level up faster than your opponents, and the vast array of items to buy, you have one of the deepest and most competitive games on the planet.

												In-depth, competitive, scientifically proven, approved by Church of England and American Monster Truck foundation,true MLG review on award-winning game: Heroes of League Of Autists 2.Alright, guys, listen. My name is [IG] D[andi] SingSing aka Wild♥♥♥♥♥Digger1998UA and i will throw some of my wild gameplay suggestions in a game that is totally not corrupted by trends, pro leagues where people play like lobsters on acid (denying your own aegis because you click like a frenzied ape when nothing around is happening) and totally not toxic community where every Ivan, George and PingPongClingClong is a distinguished pro gamer with 200 years of  training at Icefrog's monastery of enlightement somewhere inbetween Tibet's asscheeks.Okay, let's go: This riding on cat Mirana chick with face that looks like she just seen a dolphin putting on a condom. Her ultimate allows teammates to get invisibility for given time. Which can, for instance, save your carry+ support who is getting dived by frenzied Bristleback and enemy mid hero with 2 runes up his butt. So just press r - and since they didnt have any dusts - your carry is safe. Haha, no! We can't have any of that! I need more damage on my arrow that i will miss anyway. Plus if my allies are dying, i can just blame them instead of doing anything. If they are russians - just double your blame output.Okay, so we have that hero, Spector, but it doesnt look like this gay guy from Bioware game. So she has ability to move through obstacles and units, has free tons of pure damage (can't be reduced by armor) on every illusion, and map presense with her ultimate that allows her to fight at any given time without leaving her farming spots until necessary, and with high enough agility her illusions can just inflict enough damage so your team can fight freely while you patiently taking your farm. SO WHAT DO WE DO? OF COURSE WE AINT GONNA DO ANY OF THAT: we will get her phase boots because spectral dagger is clearly not enough, we will never ever get free damage on carry, and we get a bloody skill that blocks and returns damage instead (when enemy team has like. ugh, same damage output as yours?and you have no hp yet anyway?). Get vanguard that just doesn't work because of dota 2's RNG programming and then will farm radiance till 50' timemark because expensive aura with item's green damage that doesnt work on illusions (even though aura does work and can do a lot of good things, like blocking enemy's blink dagger that will be blocked by your ult in a second anyway) is clearly better than stat-gain or mana-burn.Okay, so we have that orange bird guy, that can hold solo lane against 2 or 3 people with minimum deaths (except some specific combos that just screw up his escape) and set of abilities that allows to eviscerate enemy team if your allies have at least ANYTHING to hold them in place. What are we gonna do with this hero, you may ask. Of course we will put him on a support role and make him buy mekansm, so he would never have any mana for his high damage dots that also have ridicilous slow debuff and ult that is easily countered only like by ten heroes out of 150. We have Mirana without ultimate to go get all this exp, remember?Alright, these situations are obviously too situative, so we will talk about global scale meta:Let's get to most obvious question: what hero should we pick? The answer is - PUDGE.You need mid - you pick PUDGE. You need support - you pick PUDGE. You need offlane, jungler, roamer, carry, social worker, girlfriend, president of the united states of 'Murrica? - Just pick Pudge. Why? Because someone did that on twitch.tv, you silly noob cheekyscrublord. You, of course, have same skill as pro players so you can just mimic them and game will be magically won! You don't need to think about anything, just buy recommended items and blame your teammates if something is wrong. You got a motherflipping DRAGONCLAW HOOK afterall. If you bought an item that is worth of 3 years of your school lunchboxes - nobody will have enough guts to argue with your divine skill in pressing q button at cursor location to lasthit a creep (mute everyone at the start of the game just in case tho).Next important issue is map presense, lane control, creep control, ability to analyze situation, counter-warding and all that important elements of this pseudo-strategical map game. For all of that just remember these two lines:""BUY WARDS""""WHERE THE GANG"" (it is important that you will never type ""gank"" properly).This is basically all you need to know about this game. Remember: its not important to win! It's the whole competetive spirit and sportsmanship that matters! Everyone has around 50% winrate anyway because of matchmaking, and ELO system in rankeds is based on wizard-science and tarot-fortunetelling (it's supposed to work only in chess anyway). Yeah, developers may tell you their rating system is not based on elo, but can Volvo really pull off their own mathematic rating model for the game that after all these years still lags when someone is picking a hero, armor rating still doesnt work properly, and hero with 320 movespeed can chase down and kill hero with 350 because of model animation? Oooh i think not.Anyway i give this game 100 dirty apes out of 100 and encourage you to start playing as fast as possible, to join in most viral addiction the world ever saw since taking heroin rectally, poping polyethylene packages or throwing water filled condoms out of the window became a thing.

												If I spent those 700 hours learning knitting, I guess I'd be pretty good at knitting by now.Instead I spent 700 hours doing this coprophilia and I still can't last hit.EDIT:  On a serious note, DOTA is a great competitive team game that is really fun to play and really fun to watch.  BUT it has one of worst communities I've come across. Public games are a pure pain 90% of time because of this. I spent most of my 1000+ hours with my friends and even if there was 3 of us, there was still 2 other people on our team who were capable more than enough to ruin the game completely. I am not talking about skill level or gameplay habits but about conduct and morales.  Your matches will be repeatedly ruined by idiotic people who can't behave themselves, refuse to cooperate and are not manly enough to admit defeat. No matter how good DOTA is at its core, the time I spent playing such matches was vastly irritating and I am never getting that time back. Here's a list of some pretty standard stuff that you'll be dealing with EVERY. GOD*AMN. MATCH:  -very rarely anyone ever commends you for the good plays you manage (that is, if they even notice). -if you screw something up, misclick or miss a spell, it's gonna be pointed out immidiatelly by your     team and they will talk sh*t to you and shove it into your face for the rest of the match. -should you ever raise constructive criticism against someone, no matter how kind words you use, that person will most likely not only refuse to learn from it, they will also start to actively look for any tiniest flaws on your side trying to look more pro than you. -there is no such thing as asking for something. People just expect you to do something and then   they talk sh*t to you that you didn't do it. -people will constantly blame you for their own mistakes. It will mess with your head even though it's obvious the fault is on their side. -people will start talking sh*t to you out of the blue and refuse to tell you the reason why they're doing it. If they're total fuc*ing idiots, they will just tell you to watch replay. -you will be constantly reminded to uninstall dota. -a teammate will seem completely oblivous to your attempts to communicate with them but will gladly say ""noob"" when you comment on the fact that they don't cooperate. -if you're just having a bad day and your performance is outright bad, your whole team will start a f*cking crusade against you. They will start talking the enemy team into reporting you and they will very likely sabotage your gameplay in various ways. -at a certain point when victory seems too far, some of these ret*rds just have a breakdown and will remain afk and just move occassionally to not be auto-kicked by the game, effectively ruining the match and wasting time of anyone on their team who actually wants to play. -if there is no one specific to blame for losing, they will just throw it on the person with the lowest K/D. Preferably a healer support hero who rarely gets any kills at all.  This list is just a tip of the iceberg. I am constantly losing faith in humanity because of people in this game. If you ever meet someone who doesn't qualify for this list, send them a big hug from me, because it's those people who keep me playing somehow. Them and the fact that I am too deep into the game to stop playing. It really is pretty good otherwise.  With this in mind, I cannot possibly encourage you to have your precious time ruined by terrible cowardly people who don't understand that griefing and destructive criticisim aren't helping anything and can only make matters worse.

												This is one of the best games I've ever played, and I've never felt more empty sinking hours into it.  The reward for a thoughtful draft, perfect game play, team work, and victories is an incredible feeling...but the amount of♥♥♥♥♥♥you have to put up with to get there is so insanely disgusting it's not worth it anymore.The DOTA2 community is as much a community as a pile of flesh eating bacteria.  Occasionally you meet someone nice who wants to win DOTA, but nearly every game there are raging piles of useless human flesh whose only sole purpose in life is to make you as miserable as possible, and their conduit of choice? DOTA2.I put more hours than I could imagine into this game in hopes it could only get better, sometimes I would go an entire week really enjoying the game.  I was repaid with months full of seething frustration.TLDR; Game is awesome, people you have to play with are not.  GLHF somewhere else.			",35,9,1,9,2,0,2

												Don't do it.  There was a study where monkeys had 2 buttons to press.  #1 would give a shot of juice at set intervals.  #2 would give a big shot of juice, or no juice at all, and it was rigged to give much less on average than #1.  Something like 80% of the monkeys would gamble everytime for that big shot of sweet sweet nectar.This is DOTA.  The game is glitchy, has an incredibly steep learning curve (read: you must learn to play most characters in order to be decent at one character), takes an hour or more per game (you cannot leave or get punished), has a toxic community, and is terribly imbalanced.  You cannot win by yourself, you need a team.  That's 4 strangers for most of us without DOTA friends.  You work at learning the game, read guides, watch videos, learn to not suck, and then you need 4 other people like yourself willing to sacrifice for the common good of the team.  This is where we gamble on that big shot of juice.  95% of the games you play will have a clueless player that can and WILL cost your team any chance of winning, and then the toxic players start going nuts for the next 59 minutes of your life... and you CANNOT leave.  You cannot surrender in this game.  You cannot go AFK (same as leaving).You will get kicked in the nuts 19 games out of 20, but when that magical game happens, it's a rush.The DEVs do not care, they work on pumping out skins that sell for money.  They don't fix problems, they don't care about imbalances, they don't improve the matchmaking service (try googling ""DOTA 2 The Trench"" and see what I mean).This game is like bad meth.  You assume it is you that just needs to get better or learn a trick to suddenly win 1v5.  This is not the case.  You poison yourself with all the money grubbing from the DEVs and the toxic players screaming that they had sex with your mom and that you like boys. I worked at this game to get good even as my more intelligent friends got tired of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of this game and moved on.  I can win most games with these skills I've ""accomplished"".  But, hours and hours into this, I realize that I'm playing with a bunch of a$sholes and winning the game is empty.  A victory is mostly decided by who got the randomly assigned noob/rager/troll/feeder.  19 out of 20 games, each team tries to feed on the most clueless player on the other team, and DOTA is set up to snowball hard so that after a point, there is no return.  Whichever team gets their ""carry"" (assassin types) heroes fed fastest will generally win.  Winning this way is hollow... you fed on a noob and then used the crap balance of the game to easily kill everyone else.  Or, flip side, your clueless player feeds the enemy and then you spend another 40 minute losing, realizing that it is already too late to win... yet you must stay for the long, painful beatdown.This game was set up as a mod.  Clunky, imbalanced, but functioning mod that was fun in its novelty.  And most of the problems have been grandfathered into the new version, as that is what people have grown to expect, like a pair of worn-out but familiar shoes.Do not join MOBAs if you are reading this.  The idea is fun, but the execution is brutally painful.  Read others who have sunk hours upon hours into this game only to realize how draining and hollow it is.  It is poison.  Walk away and know that this game sucks your life and money, leaving you unhappy at playing it, but sadly addicted to it for that ultra rare rush of a good fight.P.S. I'm giving my items away.  I have a ton.  Thumbs up and a positive comment, and I'll gift you some (I'm giving it all away anyway, so I'd rather give some to the greedy players who help me save the new people and push them away from DOTA)			",81,12,0,9,9,0,13

												This game allows you to exert your knowledge and understanding of layered mechanics (and exceptions of those game mechanisms) onto randomly-selected regional people without their permission or interest.Heated debates can lead to forged alliances to achieve that common goal or end into displaced frustration projected onto others to substitute one's own failures and inabilities to execute one's characters' (heroes') qualities.On the other hand, this game allows one to create 'hero build' guides as a pretense to be productive with his/her vexation as well as to fruitlessly raise the standard of expected knowledge of the game through item and ability walkthroughs in hopes that those one encounters in the future, rely on these indirect, serviced suggestion(s).

												I guess I have to review this game because I've banked so many hours into it. I'll keep it brief.Dota 2 is probably the most frustrating game ever created. Your team will let you down constantly, the enemy team will consistently pick the heroes you hate playing against the most, you will never get the hat drops you want, and your own mind and body will frequently betray you and make you contend with the fact that you are not nearly as good as you think you are (or, more likely, force you to live in a fantasy dream world where you are as good as you think you are and just blame your teammates some more). It'll turn you into a monster and destroy your life. It'll murder your loved ones and feed them to you.But you'll play it anyway. You'll ragequit and uninstall and stare at your library of games as the creeping realization sweeps over you that you not playing Dota 2 will not effect the universe in even the smallest way, will have no conceivable effect on anything. You will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning. Basically the same feeling you get when you play Dota 2. And Dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of a life. So the next day you'll find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame, staving off the moment when you'll have to face your demons for as long as you can. You will probably die alone some day and nobody will remember how high your MMR was or your sunstrike accuracy.So what are you waiting for, you worthless peons?! Get out there and dance! DANCE FOR THE PUPPETMASTER GABE! GO EARN YOUR HATS, YOU CRAVEN MONGRELS!0/10 would not recommend to anyone but can't stop playing and won't be able to stop you either.			",119,13,2,15,8,1,28

												This game has nothing to offer anybody. There is no quality fun you cannot get more quickly and efficiently elsewhere. This is an addiction which reduces your productivity, attention span, and free-time. You are becoming more bitter, narrow-minded, haughty, and old. Quit now and delete this game. There is nothing here but slow, lonely suicide.People do not have fun here. Players do not communicate succesfully with one another, they nitpick mistakes with witty remarks and mock each other. Nobody is interested in the truth; people are battling for fleeting moments of superiority. Players are loud jackasses who tumble into one argument after another, anxiously waiting for you to respond to ensure they keep the last word every time. A fair and balanced match is one in ten thousand, and no matter how hard you filter those matchmaking options you are still searching for diamonds in a garbage dump.This game is not making you happy. You are not having fun. You are not gathering fun experiences to tell, learning, or growing as a person. Instead you rage every thirty minutes and are occasionally spurred to rage quitting by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ russian teammates who believe they won the Cold War. You are addicted to readily available fun and pressure free social interaction. This game is slowly poisoning you with misogyny, anti-semitism, narcissism, a false dichotomy surrounding pro-gamers, and insecurity.I'm not telling you to get good. I'm not telling you to go outside. I'm not even telling you to make friends. Just quit DOTA. Do anything else.			",91,7,1,12,4,0,6

												Just like real-time chess, but everyone is a queen. Some queens shoot lasers, some summon huge Golems and some sing so hard your eardrums burst. Dota 2 is definitely one of the best games of this generation, and I'm certain it will remain as popular and as influnencal for many years to come.Graphics: 8.5/10Very pretty, the art direction in DotA 2 is one of the best. The source engine ensures you can run it on anything more powerful than a toaster, and have it look great too. Cosmetics look great, and fit perfectly, with some exceptions,(I'm looking at you Alpine Ursa) but many stay true to the heros artstyle. Sound: 9.5/10All heros have a multitude of voice lines,and some even respond to one another (e.g Tidehunters hatred for Kunnka). If you find the default anouncer not too flash, theres a huge variety of optional packs, from the smoth talking Narrator from bastion, to the harsh condescending tone of Pyrion Flax. Gameplay: 10/10The big one. Theres a reason DotA Allstars got so popular, not just from the incredible passsion from the community, or the dedication of IceFrog and co., but from the incredible gameplay that spawned one of gamings most popular genres. From perfectly co-ordinating a fountain hook, to getting stuck on top of a cliff accidentally as Storm Spirit, no other genre rivals DotA 2 outstanding strategic gameplay and near-vertical learning curve. At the time of writing, I have 7,469 hours played and I've only just scratched the surface in the combos, stratagy and 107 availble heros to use, it takes year of hard work, dedication and passion to become truly great at the strategical masterpeice that is Dota 2.- beardATTACK @ fren			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an amazing, dynamic game. I've met more friends on here than through any other game. But it's addictive as hell. I've found myself being lulled into a sense of comfort just by the ambient sounds. I see a jester somewhere and automatically want to play as Rubik, and I have an urge to start the game up. You will judge everyone else you play this with, you will mull over every little second of a 56 minute game, and it'll make you a horrible pathetic person.There's no reason to play this unless you need a time sink that'll come around to having a measure of control of your life. There's single player games where you go 'one more turn' and it turns into a night's afair of staying up late. But this game you start planning a whole day around raising your MMR by 200 points. Why? Because if you managed it, it'd make you feel better. What other games does your mood revolve around whether you play well, and how many other games can you name where you'd take that 'feeling good' to the point of willingly sacrificing an entire day to it?Unless you've got a team of people to play with, and you don't care how much you suck, or you're actually a pro-gamer with an active team looking for a transition, don't waste your time. There's plenty of other things to do with literally 100+ days of your life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, I decided to try out this Dota 2 and see what all the fuss is about.I can totally see why so many people play it. Very addicting game i put in like 34 hours in like 4 days! Never played a game so much in so little time before. Well, at least since Company of Heroes.Has nice simple graphics that run smooth. Any computer should be able to play this and have no real problem. That in itself makes the game more enjoyable.There is a butt load of heroes to choose and play as. Like pokemon have to play them all. Would probably take days to do.The only con i can think of. There is a lot of annoying people that constantly ping the map, and or complain the whole game.Other then that. I recommend this game, most fun i had in awhile.			",18,1,0,1,6,0,4

												At first, I thought this game was pretty good, but that was until the first time I was called a ""feeder"".Dota 2 is basically a game based around teamwork, except most of the players only do three things:1. Call each other f*gs and berate one another for slightly unwise decisions.2. Do solo farm and try to carry the match all by themselves (which never works).3. Ruin the game for new players.If you want to learn how to play Dota, you either need a really good guide or a good friend who has a few hundred hours with the game. The tutorial only explains to you the baby-♥♥♥ basics. Learning how to play by matchmaking with randos is a horrible experience, all you'll learn from the other players is that you suck because you're new and you don't understand the game and that the best course of action would be to uninstall. It doesn't help that the game has a skyscraper for a learning curve and smurfing is still very much alive and well in this toxic community.The worst thing is that this game stole all my friends back when we first started playing. One of them had a serious problem with the game for a few years until recently. He spent approximately $300 on Dota 2 cosmetics, and he's not the only one. There are thousands of young, naive players spending dozens, if not hundreds, of dollars on cosmetic items, thanks to Valve's efficient tactics and the fact that they don't do anything about scammers or people in the community trying to rip others off even more.All in all, this game is just jampacked with toxicity, from its community, to the gameplay, to Valve's business practices.EDIT: 172 people agreed with this review. Wow.A fun fact for you: The tutorials have more maps than the actual game, which has just one map. I know this is pretty standard for MOBA games, but for me, this contributes greatly to ruining fun and variety. It's just all the same tactics over and over on the same map. This doesn't only mean less excitement, but it also means that veterans will know the game just that much better, adding further to the insane learning curve.On another note, this game is pretty much the opposite of everything I like about TF2. Unbalanced classes (According to Google, every Dota hero/champion/class/whatever the hell is overpowered), only A SINGLE MAP, relies too much on teamwork when it's hard to find online (TF2 benefits from teamwork, but it's not required. It's also much easier to actually achieve teamwork because TF2 doesn't rely NEARLY as much on your early-game. The early-game in Dota literally either makes or breaks the whole game for you, setting the outcome of the match in stone literally during the first ten minutes of the game.), and also, a horrible community. I'm not saying TF2's community is good, but hell, it's miles above Dota. I don't really know why I'm comparing this game to TF2. Maybe because Valve made both games? Still, just wanted to share some actual criticism about the game itself and not the community.One guy in the comments told me ""Pfft, just block the trash talkers"". That doesn't change anything. They're still horrible at teamwork, which, like I said, is the entire point of the game. And if you block them, you can't coordinate with them. It's not only a bad game for new players because you suck, it's also a bad game for new players because everyone else sucks. Except for Koreans, whenever you see one in a game, bam, his team has won.Overall, I think Dota has great potential, but it's just too bad that the game will most likely never actually achieve to fulfill it.EDIT 2: I just came back to this game and tried it out again the hopes that maybe SOMETHING about it has gotten better.No.There's still absolutely no communication between the players except for casual pings here and there. That's not helpful at all.There are tons of balancing issues in the game, and the one character that stands out the most is Sniper. He has good abilities and does really high damage at a really fast rate at a really long distance if you play the game right. He can easily annihilate two to three heroes by himself in the late-game. Frankly, he is cheap, and he was almost practically made to steal kills (something I'll be addressing a bit later). Valve is a company structured in a way that, if you're an employee, you don't really NEED to do these things. You don't NEED to patch bugs. You don't NEED to fix balancing issues. At Valve, the employees' primary concern is getting recognition. If you add something that looks cool, you're gonna get recognition. If you're going to fix something, you're not, because you're not showing off your creativity or imagination. You're doing an important job to ensure that the product works as intended. No-one at Valve cares for that, they need more hats.Let's go back to the kill stealing. When fighting any enemy or neutral, you get much more experience and gold, as well as the kill credit, if you actually deliver the killing blow. Yep, just the last hit, no questions asked. It doesn't matter if you've reduced someone from full to 1% health and someone from your team pops out of nowhere to take the kill credit and leave you with a measly amount of gold and experience. A lot of players hate these kill thieves, but you know what? That's exactly what this game encourages. To screw other players over. Couldn't, say, the gold and experience be divided between the two players based on the damage they did? Nope. Instead, the players are forced to naturally hate each other. If you are an actually fair player who doesn't want to rely on these cheap tactics, you'll be behind in the game. What is this, Defense of the Capitalists?I previously mentioned that one friend spent $40 on cosmetics in DOTA 2. I actually played this game with him again, and he has spent about, well... $300 on the game. That's enough to buy 4 copies of GTA V here in Australia. He was also recently hacked and had $200 worth of cosmetics stolen from him. That's what you get when you purchase blatantly overpriced virtual trash that does not affect you in any way.Probably one of the absolutely worst parts of the game, and also the big reason as to why it steals lives, are the long matches. Matches usually take anywhere between 30 to 50 minutes. The longest I've seen is 70 minutes. You're not going to have time to go to the toilet (I bet Valve is in cahoots with adult diaper manufacturers), you're not going to have time to eat, you're not going to have time to speak to people while playing the game or do little chores around the house that your parents need you to do because they're incredibly impatient, and if you're going to get addicted to the game, like most of its players, you're not going to have time to have a life. See: my Russian cousin.The biggest thing I hate (for real) is that when your early-game sucks, you're going to be stuck in a losing match where you know you've lost and all your team is doing is delaying the inevitable. Losing feels horrible, and if you quit at this point, THE CONSEQUENCES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!!! LITERALLY!!! The more you abandon games (doesn't matter if the game crashes on you or if you have a slow internet connection and the entire thing stopped working or if you have a really slow connection and it messes up and boots you out of the game or if you have a slow computer, like my $300 friend, and your entire computer crashes and you can't get back in the game), the more you will be punished. So, on your first few abandons, you will get a few low priority matchmaking games (low priority games are pretty much like the normal priority games ON STEROIDS! So, more insults, less teamwork, more nasty guys, more kill steals). Then, as you keep abandoning games, the punishment gets more severe each time. The number of low priority games you get for abandoning never goes down.This is the final edit. I have pretty much run out of charac			",163,16,2,23,12,1,30

												Dota 2 is a very highly skilled game, don't expect to walk in and expect you being very good. You are going to die alot and probably yell at your team mates but that's just the nature of this game. Dota 2 takes place in an arena where you will fight to destory the enemies Anicent if you destory it; you win.The Ancient is protected by 11 stuctures called towers that protect it. Each of these towers are found in each of the three lanes bottom, middle and top. You take control of a unit that is a hero, many of them are diverse and have a lot of pros and cons such as Crystal Maiden who is really good at locking down heros early game with her stun but she is also the slowest hero in the game. You are accompanied by 4 other players including yourself to fight against another 5 players. You need to push lanes to be able to destory the enemy towers in each lane but the catch is the enemy team is doing the same thing, so you need to not only push to your victory but to stop the enemy team from pushing aswell. There is 107 heros in Dota 2 out of the 112 heroes that are in the Warcraft III. They are categorised into 3 groups. Strenght, which are usually the tanky guys. Agility, most carries are found in this category and Intelligence which most of the supports are usually found. All these heroes have different skill levels, such as Invoker who is an intelligence hero with 14 spells. He is able to create spells with 4 of his spells, creating the other 10. He is able to create tornados which disable enemies, meteors which looks epic and burns enemies that stand in front of it. Just an all round crazy hero. Viper is arguably the easiest hero which as 2 passive spells (Passive spells are spells that work all the time, you don't need to activate them) and 2 other spells which are targetable.You can customise your Dota experience with annoucer packs which change the voice of the annoucer which include Glados and the narrator from the Stanley Parable. You can change your HUD to different themes. The game allows you to buy tickets where you can support tournments, some of these tournments allowing you to directly contribute to the prize pool. Most of the time it is 25%. In 2014, The International is a annual tournment created by Valve for Dota 2. In 2014, the prize pool for this tournment became 10.9M dollars. First place got 5M dollars! If you are into ESports then this game will be up your ally.  Dota 2 is a hard game, but if you look in the right places you are able to learn a lot, if you aren't sure you want to play this game, you can PM me and I can teach you how to play. I honestly don't mind.  ",399,102,4,49,21,3,32

												This is yet another new release by the company ""MOBA"" (you may know this company from their popular games such as League of Legends, Dead island Epidemic and Dawngate).This is a very slow paced first person shooter set in the age after the 3rd great war in which humanity has been set back in the ages where magic was still okay to use, in this game you play as an ex soldier trying to defeat the main communist overlord ""sniper"" who threatens america as we know it. The single player aspect of this game is probably the best experience you'll have in this game as the online is currently dead, the developers stopped updating this game after league of legends was confirmed to be more balanced and a hell of a lot better.They did however unlock a new game mode called ""Compendium"" in which you simulate reading a book and collect trading cards.I'll give this game 3 meepos out of 5, it's okay but the fact that you're required to be able to speak russian to get this game really lets it down.

Its a matter of fact that I'm addicted to this game at times.I've had games playing with the dumbest idiots being my friends yet those games I've had more fun in being the stupid stuff we do or how we mess around them being half drunk and laughing.That's how Dota should be. Drunk and having fun. Something this community can't understand No matter how much you try, how good you get it won't get better. I can't recommend this game because of what it has done to me as a person and how half of the hours in game I've spent in anger rather than at least mild amusement.

												This is a game with potential, genuinely good qualities, but it has severe issues.DOTA 2 requires teamwork to win, but it is filled with incompetent & abusive players. To make matters worse, matchmaking results are not balanced. One team often has better players than the other right from the start.Neither of these issues would be severe, if not for a punishment system which forces you to remain in 60-90 minute matches that are unbalanced & abusive. Despite the game having two modes, ranked & unranked, and the latter being described as casual, both are virtually the same.I have advocated that if unranked is indeed meant to be the ""casual"" mode of DOTA 2, then the punishment system for inactivity & abandoning, should not apply here.After remaining in a miserable 60-90 minute match to avoid an abandon & subsequent low priority, you may still get reported by abusive players. In DOTA 2 it isn't uncommon for a player to blame you for their own mistakes & then report you. Example, seen people solo tower diving or jungling alone in the enemies territory & as soon as they die they blame everyone else. The time when you're most likely to receive a fraduluent report is when your team has a party of 3 or 4 people, and you're the outsider; in this case, the abuser won't want to blame their friends so it is easier to blame the stranger. So point of this paragraph is to highlight that remaining in a bad match, doesn't always save you from the punishment system & it highlights that there is nothing ""casual"" about unranked as a result.The only casual DOTA 2, is modded DOTA 2. Unfortunately most of the servers for that are in Peru & run like♥♥♥♥♥♥This is a free game, so there isn't much risk in trying it, but there are other games in this genre that don't force you to endure unfair or abusive 60-90 minute matches, so I'd recommend you try those first.

												The first time you play you will have a very unpleasant experience and most likely uninstall the game. Within a few days, however, you'll feel an urge to play it. You're going to watch videos of pro people teaching you how to play, and you're going to think that now you're really good.You're wrong.Over time, however, things will get better, and you'll actually start winning. Then, you start losing again, but this time it's not your fault; it's your teams fault. Always remember that NOTHING is EVER your fault. Your dumbass anti-mage was complaining that you were stealing his farm, but it's your farm dammit! Then pudge is getting butthurt about losing lane because he never had a flying courier, when the real reason he lost is because he didn't give you unit control when you are clearly a better pudge! Meanwhile the enemy team is getting fed because your teamates never backed you up when you blitzkrieged in 1v5, and they even have the nerve to question your methods! Then you notice that your dumbass anti-mage is in the jungle farming because ""he couldn't farm in lane."" You know, however, that he is just a noob.Eventually the enemy is pushing your tier 3s, and the game is obviously over. This is the time when you give up and sit in base. Ignore the fact that your team has won the last two teamfights and you are starting to catch up, it's better if you just quit now. While you're waiting in base, make sure that the enemy team knows that you are not at fault in your loss. Make sure you type in all-chat ""team noob"" followed up by ""report anti-mage."" If they ask why you want them to report him, ignore them, if your team has the bodacity to try and defend themseves, repeatedly say phrases such as ""lol ur so bad"" and ""ur just mad cuz you cant play."" You could also take the alternative route and say things like ""им незрелые восьмилетний"" and ""я должен убить себя.""Yea, the game and communtiy can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥sometimes, but it's also a super fun game that requires fast paced decision making as well as strategical analysis. Plus, it unifies gamers and conservatives by creating one common hatred: Russians.All in all, this game is 90% getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and 10% feeling like you're on top of the world, but that 10% makes you feel sooooo good that it keeps pulling you back.

												I don't know where to start, this is the first time i feel the need to write a review. I spent 30 minutes reading reviews on forums and here in steam (80-90% negative and that comming from players with 2k to 7k hours spent on the game) about the last patch and as someone who has played this game since dota 1 I've seen a lot of changes... some were good and some ofcourse not but you could've get along with them and even start to like them. However this last update 7.00 is not like them... it completely changes everything, to add so much new things in one time it's so unbalanced and with the tree skill every hero is different now the supports are carries and the carries supports it's like i have no knowledge of the game.About the visuals. The new HUD is really small (keep in mind many people play on standart laptops size 15.6"") and the health bar is hard to watch when it's on the bottom instead on top of the skill bar. It will really be good if after all the changes you get the option to adjust all of those (for example to expand the HUD like the map size).I would like as many others the new update to be a new game like DotA 3 so a lot of people have the option to play the last game patch 6.88 we all like but i know this won't happen unless a lot of people leave the game or professional players don't say something. If the idea of this update was to draw more people to the game keep in mind is it worth it and will they be more than the one leaving it... I personally won't be playing it unless some drastic changes take place which most likely won't happen.... ",2,0,0,1,0,0,0

												Changed my review from positive to negative due to the disgusting 7.00 patch.I'm a veteran player with almost 6,000 hours on record in Dota 2.The new HUD is completely♥♥♥♥♥♥ so tiny you can't see abilities well or inventory items easily. Everything is dumbed down. Scanning enemy inventories for their items is also a disaster (need a microscope to see). Essential stats and other important information is hidden under tool tips which obstruct the screen when you hover over them. The HUD is a critical part of playing Dota 2 and often a lot of time is spent looking at this, so the changes have a really detrimental effect on enjoyment.On the right hand side of the screen there are kill pop ups and rune pick up notices blocking out your view 24/7. Minimap is ugly, coloured terribly and extremely small (can be re-sized but doesn't solve the other issues). The new update genuinely makes me feel dizzy and unwell. My eyes/head hurt. It's a real pain both literally and figuratively.That aside, the fact that there are now 4 bounty rune spawn locations makes the whole point of bounty runes futile. They used to be a luxury bonus for those who invested time in securing rune areas.Nobody challenges rune spawns anymore early on, because two are safely on the dire team side of the map and the other two are safely on the radiant team side of the map. So bounties have simply become a meaningless chore to level up faster for each team.Valve has cut down leveling in general so that it's easier and made adjustments to mimic the lame League of Legends MOBA. Most notable is the similar map design to LoL which is a complete ♥♥♥♥ing eyesore to play on and the ultimate system now being skilled at levels 6, 12 and 18.Neutral creep camps are different, seemingly placed in any part of the map with no thinking. A number of winding paths intersecting each other in the jungle creates a maze for players to walk through with little strategy.The new ""skills tree"" system appears to have potential to work, but ultimately comes off as a cheap attempt at complexity when the game already had so much depth.Overall, the feel of Dota 2 is very child-like now.I cannot recommend this game in good conscience until major fixes are made.4/10			",66,3,0,9,2,0,8

												Imagine that Chess was only playable online and a single company was encharged of promoting/sustaining it. But, suddenly, that company decided to turn Chess into Checkers and you cannot ever play Chess again. Surely, it would only and obviously be a matter of adapting yourself to the new game, right? I mean, Chess is just like Checkers. If you're not ""capable"" of adapting yourself to it, then there are no doubts that you are a bad Chess player and you should resort to playing Chinese Checkers or Monopoly. This pretty much sums up what is happening to Dota right now. 7.00 is a big ƒück to your face if you enjoyed what the game was before it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First twenty hours playing this game, got called NOOB for so many times that i went down to my basement and cried dailySecond twenty hours playing this game, joined others and called the new guy 'NOOB' to avoid being called 'NOOB'Third twenty hours playing this, I finally got the courage to call others 'NOOB' all by myselfFourth twenty hours playing this game, I finally became mature enough to stop with all the NOOB bs and started to give advice to the other players from atop my mighty throneOverall, DOTA 2 is an addictive, competitive MMO whose community precedes its reputation, almost everyone is downright selfish, everyone only wants more kills to sate their hunger for commendations, which they even beg for.The trick to enjoying it though ?start playing with friends or people you know, make a plan, help your teammates, and CHOOSE A SUPPORT IF YOU SEE THERE ARE NONE !and reach level 13 and you can play ranked matches, where the people are not much friendlier but will at least help you out.EDIT: oh and always remember to uncheck  'Russia' when selecting serverswhy ? no reason, just thought i should say that ^^GODLIKE GAME !  someone kill it (you will get this reference after playing the game)Still good in 2016			",737,242,19,92,54,11,96

I'm only talking from my experience in pubs.It feels gratifying when you win.It feels frustrating when you lose.In DotA 2, you will lose alot whether you want it or not.What matters in this game isn't your hero or this pointless 'counter picking'.Your performance is solely dependant on skill, experience and reaction time. However, no matter how good you are, defeat is inevitable with a bad team.At the beginning when you're matched with new players such as yourself, this can be quite infuriating and almost made me stop playing after approximately 10 hours.That's why I strongly advise you to play with friends, so you actually have a coordinated team.About the game itself: It's a solid MOBA[en.wikipedia.org] with a big diversity of unique heroes. The majority of the community is quite unpleasant at times and isn't very beginner-friendly which can be really off-putting. If you ignore these people (a.k.a. muting) and just keep doing your thing, you will find yourself genuinely having fun after ~50 hours. 50 hours sounds kinda extreme but it really isn't. This is the kind of game you can spend thousands of hours on and you still won't be able to fully master it.If you're ready to go through all this hardship and frustration, go for it, I highly recommend DotA 2.If you're looking for a casual multiplayer game that you can get into quickly, stay away from this.

												This brand new game by Riot puts a spin on the definition of ""Casual Gaming"". What consumers thought would be another fun and enjoyable experience for the family turned out to be much more. This game is called ""Dota 2"" which is an acronym for ""Delicious Orange Teamwork Association 2"", the sequel to the original DOTA.    DOTA 2 revolves around 2 teams of 5 players each (the perfect number for a happy family and maybe even a friend to all sit down on the couch and play together as a team) who are both trying to sell as many oranges as possible while sabotaging the enemy team's orange sales!    Gameplay is very casual and easy to pick up. You don't even have to play the tutorial if you don't want to! Just jump in the game, let everyone know you're new and start selling oranges!    Speaking of new players, those who are new to the DOTA universe might be a little discouraged by all the terms that more experienced players use, so I'll explain a few of them here. -""Feeding"" is when your team is selling oranges at a very fast rate. This is very good, so make sure you feed as much as possible!-""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; is a term you may see thrown around a lot by players of this game. DOTA is a very popular game in Russia, because it is developed by a mysterious individual named ""Ice Man"" who is from Russia! ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; is a friendly term that roughly translates to ""Keep up the good work!""-""Report"" When someone says ""Reported."" or ""Im going 2 report u!"" that means that they are filling out a sales report on how well you've sold oranges! This is a fun way to keep track of how good you are at the game, and it's considered friendly to try to report the best players you see in a game, even if they're on the enemy team!    DOTA 2 has over fifty dozen players on at a time, so you better get playing now and become a veteran because before you know it, everyone and their grandmas will be playing the new nation-sweeping casual game DOTA 2!

												Reposting since under the old review system I would be forced to ""recommend"" that people play this.This game is like a shower fight between you and another naked man. You're both in a small shower tub trying desperately to shove each other over while at the same time trying not to accidentally touch peens and catch the gay. When you slip over and land painfully on your ♥♥♥ the other guy, completely by accident, gets his soap-stained foot into your mouth just as you both realize somebody downstairs is hogging all the hot water. Then one of the guys from downstairs who should be helping you get back up on your feet instead comes into the room and yells at you for stealing all the hot water even though it's the other way around. You're the noob who can't get better at naked shower fights no matter how hard you try, the other guy in the tub is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ from the enemy team who mains bounty hunter, anti-mage, puck, ursa, or some other broken class, and the people downstairs who made you run out of hot water are your teammates getting last hits on what would be your kills and turning them into assists on your end. The guy who comes in from downstairs to yell at you is the teammate who, even though you're farming plenty of creeps and earning plenty of gold and experience from them, insists you're killing them ""the wrong way"" and are therefore an idiot noob.The naked shower fight is also a one-way road: once you jump in, there is virtually no returning. You become enslaved and before long all you'll ever want to do for the rest of your life is play dota. You won't even want to talk to or interact with anyone from the outside world unless they are similarly enslaved, by dota (or LoL). The video game world then slowly proceeds to divide and coalesce into two and only two distinct spheres of existence and reality: people who play mobas, and people who don't. Neither side ever so much as glimpses at the other for the remainder of each of its constituents' entire lives because its masochistic addiction level is insane enough to leave Starcraft and WoW in the dust. If you complain about how slippery the surface of the showertub is, people will just yell at you because you're terrible at the game and don't consult the online guidebook and metagame like they do for every minute, individual step taken throughout the game. If you want to get ""good"", you are unequivocally required to follow the instruction book down to the exact letter even if it hardly makes a difference in-game, if at all. If you do otherwise, you will get yelled at. Every single time without exception. To not get yelled at, you have to assimilate into the formless mass. This is all a part of the self-enslavement process: you won't come back, ever. And within a month you'll find yourself just parrotting the same♥♥♥♥♥♥people were yelling at you for earlier, because you'll be one of them by that point. And you literally will not return. You'll be doing this for the entire rest of your life and will be speaking it like a language.			",115,15,2,18,12,2,12

												DOTA 2 is the best in the MOBA class. I've played LoL, DOTA and some lesser known MOBAs and DOTA 2 is by far the best. In addition, it is F2P which is amazing. Unlike LoL or HoN which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to buy a single hero, DOTA 2 immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free. The only paid content are cosmetical items that do not change gameplay. Graphics are great. Gameplay is great. Crashes are very minimal. ITS FREE.			",54,10,4,5,5,0,2

												the game itself is good, had a lot of fun. But the problem with this game is that u are too much dependable on the people u get with you in matchmaking. Apparantly you have too much people who want to play carry, and then fail at it, what results in a waste of time. It usually starts already a hero selection. People don't communicate, only play what they want to play and usually lacks of teamplay when the game is busy.Too bad, because the game itself is good, the community is for 80% flamers, egotrippers, wannabe carry players, very rude			",33,1,0,1,2,0,9

												I have put so many hours into this. So-many-hours. It is one of those games where you spend so much time learning the mechanics: items, heroes, terrain, team strategy, etc. You learn all these things and it makes you want to stay with it because you've put so much work to build yourself to a decent MMR and win rate.This game is like a drug. Did I enjoy it with my friends at times? Sure. But the enjoyment always fought against the weight of the overwhelming frustration.It has the most toxic community I have ever seen in my decade of serious gaming. It wasn't so bad at first, but over the past hundred or so games it has become notably worse. Far worse. Make one mistake and you will have threats from your teammates to report you. Don't have a bad game, or you will have someone urging your team and the other team to report. It's just constant bickering and trash talk on both sides. Is it like this every game? No, of course not. There are decent individuals who play this game who will present constructive criticism and encouragement in a mature fashion. They might contain their frustration during the game or voice it over the chat, and that's understandable. This game will do that. But the vast majority are, sadly, among the poison that kills this game for me. A lot of the time I even ended up with teammates who didn't speak my language despite my search under US east. I can handle one or two or three or four. But when I go three games in a row where everyone on my team and the enemy team doesn't speak my language then, well, there is some great team communication there. That's really the only issue I've had with the game itself. Not too bad.The satisfaction from winning a few games can't make up for the stress and grievances encountered to get there either. Honestly, this game isn't fun anymore because of the community. It is well done. It's a great game, but the community ruins the satisfying experience I once had for this game. It is a real shame. I have 2,000+ hours of game time. 2,000+ hours of effort getting myself to around a 3k MMR. 2,000+ hours poured into a game that requires dedication and satisfaction through numbers and stats. And I am still going to try my best to give this game up despite all the work put into it. It will be tough. If you haven't played the game yet, I can't recommend it. Not when the community is worse than it's ever been. And I'm not basing this on just a couple dozen games. I'm basing my community experience on hundreds of recent hours. It is a real shame how the players in the game can ruin it. Maybe when Overwatch comes out it will have a decent community (being optimistic) and I can pour my hours into that and finally ditch this game for good. Maybe I'll come back when my friends are on to form a team, but I will never again jump into solo ranking with the community as horrible as it is. I really hate to leave a negative review on this great game, but the community has sucked the joy out of it.			",64,20,0,6,3,0,3

												Dota 2 is the semi-sequel/remake/re-release/evolution of the long-running WarCraft 3 mod Defense of the Ancients, which in itself was based on a custom map for StarCraft called Aeons of Strife. After the release of the original Dota map in 2003, the WarCraft 3 community began producing a long line of Dota spin-offs, sequels and mods (just as Eul, Dota's creator, had used AoS as inspiration for Dota itself), which culminated in the release of DotA: Allstars by Steve ""Guinsoo"" Feak.Allstars would become the most dominant and consistently updated version of all the Dota maps and mods. In 2005, Guinsoo passed the torch to the enigmatic IceFrog, who has been supporting, updating, and shaping Dota ever since. His changes have been the most significant, the most popular (the mod grew more during his time than ever before), and arguably have benefited and enriched Dota as a whole. By 2010, DotA: Allstars became simply DotA, and IceFrog was showing no signs of stopping. Later that year, Dota 2 was formally announced (with its development spear-headed by both IceFrog and Eul, both of its most important ""authors""; its past and present, alike), entered a semi-closed beta in late 2011, and was finally officially released in mid-2013... and the rest is history.History lessons aside, Dota 2 is a game of uncompromising depth and complexity. Though its gameplay intricacies can appear opaque, arbitrary and incomprehensible at first sight, the way these expansive game mechanics interact with one another when exposed to the element of player imperfection is truly remarkable: over a hundred heroes, each with at least four spell-based abilities and all capable of using up to six magical items, from a massive arsenal of over a hundred. Games can last anywhere from 25 to 55 minutes, and possibly far more!Dota's metagame is constantly shifting, and as of writing the game and mod are at total parity through version 6.80, released earlier this year. On top of that, it is completely free to play, with no features locked out to any players whatsoever. Not even cosmetic items, which form the backbone of the game's vast micro-transaction-based economy: these items are freely distributed by Valve to all players through level-based gift drops and random-chance item drops. Free game updates alter the game balance significantly, while introducing new seasonal game modes, and far more. And that's not even scratching the surface of the game's competitive scene, with its many tournaments, its constantly evolving teams and its own storylines, all leading up to the annual Valve-organized grand championship: The International.It may be incredibly difficult and frustrating at first, but given time, patience, simple memory and a keen mind, anyone can ultimately come to see Dota as perhaps the most enjoyable, enthralling and captivating game experience ever conceived. Oh, and it's sort of fun[/b]. Sort of. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dota 2 was a fantastic game but for some reason, probably the greed of appealing to a wider audience, the devs decided to copy elements from League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm. It's great an all that they tried to ""improve"" the game, but they fail to understand why people choose to play Dota 2 over the others.League of Legends is distinct enough to stand on it's own and have it's fans.Heroes of the Storm is distinct enough to have it's own fans.Dota 2 WAS distinct enough to have it's own fans.People will always have a favourite flavour of MOBA, just like people have their favourite flavour of icecream.Now after 7.00 though, Dota 2 looks more like the rest, it's lost part of it's distinction and it's became a weaker game looking more like an amalgamation of the others. Our vanilla Dota that we've all enjoyed for years has been discontinued and is replaced with this neopolitan stuff.I just can't enjoy this game anymore, the changes are too far from what that glorious golden heart of Dota was and the garbage new HUD doesn't help. It's got way less information, it takes longer to see it, plus important information like ♥♥♥♥ing health and mana is further away from where your eyes rest. Terrible.So great were the map changes that even the Dota 2 logo isn't even accurate anymore, it used to represent the two ancients with the river in between, now it needs that Baron Roshan island in the middle.

It's a incredibly deep game which intergrates complex gameplay and mechanics, its a very popular game when you notice the international competitive scene. however be warned that this game has a steep learning curve and I still consider myself a casual gamer type for this game and as most multiplayer game, you will encounter abrasive players in the community which could ruin the experience, though that can bes fixed by muting or reporting the player(s).

												Dota 2 is one of if not the most frustrating and aggravating game ever created. Your teammates will cater the enemy team, not back you up, and refuse to call missings or place wards. The enemy team will always pick combos or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ heroes that will make you want to immediately leave the game while your teammates pick 4 carrys after you randomed Phantom Assassin and tell you to buy the wards. Every other game you will get a Russian Pudge picker that feeds 3 kills mid in 5 minutes and immediately ruins all the work you've done last hitting every creep and harassing the enemy out of lane. You'll rage and call ""GG"" early and trash talk your teammates but you'll still keep playing in hope that the game will turn around. As things start to finally look good, you get bashed 5 times in a row by a faceless void or the Ogre Magi will get a 4x multi-cast on you 2 times in a row while the Nature's prophet is pushing your top barracks. But after all the rage inducing pain, you keep playing. You suffer through it for the chance of that amazing, satisfying comeback even though you're 20,000 gold behind the enemy team. Only to have your dreams crushed when the enemy team finally kills your ancient. But you still keep playing due to the feeling you get when you get that rampage that allows you to push to victory. Even so, after the game you'll still rage because of the common chest you get as a reward for your 60 minutes of pain and suffering. When you finally get that mythical you've always wanted, valve will come out with an event that lowers the price and makes it almost worthless. It's a drug that once hooked to, is almost impossible to break. You almost don't even realize you're raging and forget that you're telling your best friend how much of a feeding ♥♥♥♥♥♥ he is and how this lost game is because of him when you're the one who has 1 kill and 13 deaths.You keep playing in hope that you'll get good enough where you'll be able to play with Dendi or the other pros and you know that'll most likely never happen but you keep playing in hope of it happening one day.I would not wish this addiction on my worst enemy. But I can't stop you, nor can I stop playing myself.			",45,4,0,8,5,0,3

												I have been a gamer for my whole life, but I never really put a ton of time into any one game. In the early 2000s, when I had a lot of free time, Quake 3, Elite Force, Jedi Knight 2, et cetra all took up a ton of my time; but as my age progressed, I had less time to dedicate to gaming. Mass Effect 1 and 2 both took about 100 hours away from me; but that was probably the most I'd invested in many years.I currently have around 500 hours of Dota 2, and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. The gameplay is spectacular, the community is great (I have made more Steam friends on this game than any other), the meta is interesting, the professional scene is a blast to watch, and the game is extremely well supported - especially with the recent Wraith Night/Legion Commander content update. The thing is that I'm not great at Dota 2. I've put almost 500 hours in, and there's still more for me to learn - there are still some heroes I have yet to play! It is a lot of investment, but once you 'get' it, you will have an absolute blast.EDIT: Just updating this now that I've put around 1600 hours in.I still completely stand by everything that I said previously. The game is super fun, and I'm really enjoying playing with all of the friends I've made in it. I've also experienced some of the negative parts of the community, and they're unfortunate; but I must say that they are far and few between. The community is largely welcoming, and I've made some fantastic friends through it - ones I hang out with in real life now.Definitely play the game, the learning curve is steep but entirely worth it.

												You cost your team the game.Not the guy who went AFK for 30 minutes to chase a goat. Not the person who charged the enemy zerg group alone. Not the idiot who attacked Roshan by themselves. You. It is always your fault.Play this with a set group of people you know and trust. Otherwise you shall be thrown into a community where everyone hates eachother, they all think you are the worst player ever even if you are the best on the team, and are never ever responsible for their own screw-ups. Seriously... the sheer volume of rage I have seen players show in this game is unlike anything I've seen anywhere else.I stay away from this game now not because it is bad, but because ragey people ruin my fun. If you can get past this... it's actually a pretty decent game.You have been warned. o_o			",241,93,0,62,44,2,65

												To those who hasn't played dota and willing to start playing: 1. You'll always be wrong.2. You'll always be blamed. 3. You'll be always noted as a 'stealer' after killing. 4. You'll get reported for no reason. 5. You'll be thought naturaly how to insult in; Russian, Tagalog, and other languages you have never heard before.6. Roles that are actualy exist: All Carry.7. You'll be forced to hate others without knowing the reason. 8. Best way to improve your good-sport behave is by stop playing any games. 9. You'll regard this game slightly higher than your school. 10. On stage 4000 MMR, the objective would be ""Buy A Microphone"".11. You'll get higher scores in English subject. 12. Your ego will be boasted. 13. Mental illness. Prove? check all reviews of Dota. Negative writings for a thumbs up. 14. In the end, you'll find yourself regretting pn why have you decided to play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pure filth, the likes of which you won't find anywhere else that is not a MOBA(you'll find it in other MOBA's, apparently the hellbound enjoy this type of product).  The game keeps wanting me to try it.  The playerbase keeps wanting me to abandon all hope in humanity.So.......If you REALLY don't care about other people, this may be for you.

												After over 3000 hours of gameplay, I can safely sum Dota 2 up in two words:THE TRENCH (aka Forced Fifty)You will win. You will lose. You will improve your skill, but you will never improve your score. --wait for it--No. Matter. What. Why? Because of THE TRENCH / ForcedFifty. -The better you get at this game, the worse your teammates will be. This is not a paradigm, it is mechanically programmed into the game. -If you can carry 1 idiot on your team, the game will handicap you with 2. Skilled enough to carry 2? After a few games you will get 3. Hardcore enough for 3? Now you get FOUR-ever. -Your teammates will -- i ♥♥♥♥ you not－－ go out of their way to lose on purpose. You picked another carry because it seemed logical? Well guess what, I got a few replays that will show crybabies throwing the game so you cant compete for thier spotlight. This is the only game where teammates ENJOY LOSING because it means they can bring you down to their garbage level. -People literally buy and sell accounts off MMR because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammates and you will be a guinea pig in their money making ponzi schemes. Have fun wasting hours of your time on 4k MMR (the alleged decent tier) while you witness first hand feeders lose you the game minute by minute. I could have been a doctor with those 3000 hours.

												As a Guy who played dota from its earliest versions for 10 years, I always enjoyed updates because they always added good things (balanced heroes and items, new heroes, new terrain etc) but this new 7.00 Update just made most of original dota players angry , and I can tell the reason is pretty obvious, they just ruined a game which didn't needed a major gameplay change or anything, dota before this update was dota but now it's a mixture of LoL and dota and some new bs, this is not what I've played for last 10 years of my life everyday, there are a lot of things I can say about this new update but in overall I can tell u this is not dota, and I can't enjoy playing dota anymore, I'm just gonna play sometimes from now on until they do something about this crap update.5/10 is my current rate for this game but if something good happens about this update I will change my review.

Posted: December 19, 2016
												Honest feedback / observations - Dota 2 - 7.00I was watching the eg vs newbie game last night, and I've honestly never been that uninterested in a pro game, and this is coming from someone who really enjoys watching them, almost to the point of enjoying it more than playing .. It was hard to pinpoint one specific reason why I disliked the viewing experience, there are so many changes to this once great game it's really hard to put the feelings into plain text, its almost unrecognizable from previous versions. Nevertheless, I tried to honestly reflect on my thoughts and have covered some of the issues I've noticed and that the caster pointed out as well, see below. At face value, and for me personally, the game seems to have generally lost what made it so special to begin with - it was different than the other MOBA's, it had its own unique identity and old school feel. I feel that this is due to the very gradual changes/improvements that patches have brought over the years, never straying too far from the core gameplay. Change is good and inevitable in many cases, but this isn't change, this is almost a new game. The game feels dumbed down/too easy in some respects (6x runes/talent trees/less emphasis on item progressions/item countering/arcady feel) but also too complicated in some respects (horrible pathing/lame fighting areas with too many stairs and jungle juke spots/extra towers in the jungles/small hud that fs up my focus/vital info being hidden or taken out completely etc etc etc). Basically what most people are saying on here is how I am feeling as well - if you're one of the people who puts their arms up and says go into more detail, please just ask, I would be happy to elaborate. Now... The caster, who has been playing basically since dota inception (and was also once a beta tester for icefrogs patches) kept noting how terribly ""boring"" the update is, and compared many of the changes to games like LOL/HOTS. I personally found it refreshing to hear someone with loads of experience break down some of the shortcomings of this new patch as not many high level dota players have as of yet (why would they bite the hand that feeds I guess). There were several specific points made as to why the new patch has fallen short and I wish I could remember exactly what all of his points were. Nevertheless, one thing that stood out was when the caster spoke about the new runes, which he disliked very much. This sort of sums up what he said: The new runes effectively force players to go to point X at time X, and if you don't you're missing out. It feels like a forced meta, and that there is now a very specific formula to the game that promotes less creativity. Support players can hangout in jungles to collect runes etc most of the early game, pick up their talent tree exp or gold bonus or w.e and then start 5 manning. In general, he felt that whoever has the better lineup tends to win, and thought that many games were effectively won or lost at the draft (obviously there's more to it but I thought it was an interesting statement). He also absolutely ripped into the new HUD - however i think most players tend to agree (even the ones who call out the 'whiners') that the HUD sucks and will most likely continue to be overhauled. He also mentioned that, although there is not much public outcry from the pros, that behind closed doors many of the pro players are extremely disappointed with the new direction of the game. He covered many other issues that I do not have the time/energy/memory to touch on but as you can tell..I care deeply for this game. I am not the type of person to come on forums to talk ♥♥♥♥/complain but I felt forced to in this case.. I have not abandoned the game yet as I think that is a premature knee jerk reaction, however, I am abstaining from the current state of the game until (I hope) changes are made.			",2,2,0,0,0,0,0

												When you are done eating Thanksgiving dinner at the kid's table (League of Legends), DOTA 2 welcomes you to the grown-up table.Dota 2 has a level of depth and polish that the other Moba games out there just hasn't seem to have reached yet.  What is remarkable is, Dota 2 has reached this level of depth and polish in a remarkably short amount of time.  What started as a relatively rough beta has blossomed into a competitive game that entertains, captivates and truly engrosses people who are into competitive gaming.  Valve has done a bang up job making this game free, and having all of the ""buy"" stuff totally optional to those who are interested in it.  I think the method of giving people drops that they can decide to equip or unlock via unlocking chests is genius.  I hope they get all of the money.			",230,36,5,32,25,3,18

Half of your team afk in base? I keep playing. Why? Because I'm Anti-mage.This hero is the ultimate 1v9 hero. If played correctly you literally can't lose with this hero. You may be thinking that if you played any hero correctly then you can't lose either but that's simply not true. Anti-mage is unique with this characteristic.I go safelane. I farm. The offlaner tries to contest but I am too good. I blink on him. I trade. I back off. We both salve up. He's got no mana. I've won the lane, like always. I am Anti-mage. Nothing matters more than farm. I control the lane. I'm farming so close to my tower that I'm impossible to gank. I can not die. I will never die.16 minutes. Battlefury, Power treads, Poor mans shield, Vladmir's Offering. I've already won. Nothing can stop me now but myself. I am fearless. I push out lanes. I take towers. I force rotations. I am Anti-mage. Thousands of calculations going on in my head. I keep track of glyph, five individual teleport scroll cooldowns, how much each enemy is farming and when they will have specific items, relative position of both couriers etc. I can not lose now. Manta, Heart, Butterfly, Abyssal. I've not finished farming.""♥♥♥♥ing AM picker, no skill"" The flame only fuels me. ""Wow, nice work AM you took racks"" I don't need your praise peasant. I'm ♥♥♥♥ing Anti-mage. The rest of the my 'team' is irrelevant. They only get in the way of my goal. The enemy ancient.Moonshard, Boots of Travel 2. I buy the wards, the gems are on me. I take the throne. I've won the game. 900GPM. Pathetic, I could do better. I'm not trying hard enough. I've failed.""Match found"". I pick Anti-mage. I am Anti-mage.			",9,0,1,1,0,0,2

												I've clocked in 2.5k hours in Dota2 and all I can say is the new patch really changed the whole experience for me. At first I thought it wasn't going to change the love I had for the game. Sadly, after many games in patch 7.00 I just can't seem to enjoy the game as much as I did before. I do believe that change is for the better and I really hope it is in this case. And no, I won't quit Dota2. Maybe just play it less frequently as compared to before.			",11,0,0,3,0,0,0

												An amazing competitive game that has been ruined by the playerbase. Unless you have four other friends to play with, you don't wanna try it. After 1000 hours of gameplay with random people (mostly) I can honstly say - don't play it. Don't play it unless it's with friends. If you do, however, decide to give it a shot, you're in for a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥alking and griefing. People will also abuse report tool a lot, and refuse to speak english on english servers. Have fun!

												Joining DOTA 2 is like moving to America from another country. As a new immigrant, you will be yelled at, spit upon, called racial slurs that are incorrect to your nationality, and screamed at for being stupid and ignorant. You will be a drain on every match causing the economy of your team to drop with your silly actions. Those who are ""long-time natives"" will support your with their skilled labor. You will be given gold to buy things that you don't deserve. After several hundred hours of work, for which you see little to no compensation, you will finally do something right. People will look at you in shock. How did this second rate citizen do so well? Was it blind luck? A miracle? The immigrants who have no desire to assimilate will continue to  laugh at you (jajajajajaja) and shame you, yelling at you in Spanish and Portuguese. But if you keep at it, if you do nothing but play, you will have more of these moments where the real citizens start to treat you as one of their own. Even complimenting, nay, commending you from time to time. On that long road to being a citizen of this new capitalist jungle if you succeed, you will be praised and glorified. You will given wealth and fame. People will watch your every move and pay you money to learn to be you. If you already live in America, and don't want to learn what it feels like to be an immigrant, then you could continue to sit on your entitled white♥♥♥♥♥and play Heroes of the Storm.If you like this review, check out some of my other reviews: WunWeg's ReviewsOr check out my blog: ZeeModernNerdBlog[zeemodernnerdblog.wordpress.com] ",80,25,0,8,10,0,12

~[Today in International DOTA News]~   -More Peruvians are setting their preferred language to English without knowing a single word of it, despair is on the rise.  -Filipinos are committing mass suicide in ranked matches, shouting what frightened onlookers describe as a ""wew"".  -Russians agree that the only heroes worth playing in the game are Pudge, Invoker, and Sniper. However Russians themselves have no idea how to play these heroes, and continue to yell incomprehensible profanities in the chats.  -In other news it seems that Mexicans are causing world-wide panic as they do nothing of value, refuse to support/initiate/carry, steal vital last hits/kills, and feed on teams everywhere. The Mexicans strangely enough, cannot see that what they are doing is not only wrong, but is also making them look worse as a race.  -And finally the number of English players is decreasing substantially, as many take their own lives after losing match after match while on 4 stack teams of foreigners. This however will hopefully force the now homeless Peruvians and Mexicans into joining the Russian and Filipino servers, so they may kill eachother off at last. Bringing about the death of DOTA 2, and the start of world peace.~This has been Russell Stover with your International DOTA News, and may god have mercy on us all. ",118,12,1,14,6,1,15

												Its fun till you realize you get reported for no reason and have no way of countering the report or explainning yourself. The issue is if you get reported you can not get items in the games till you play a number of matches which takes about 30 to 60 minutes to play. This is a problem cause anyone can report you for the three following which is not your fault or a way to avoid them. Its ridiculous they don't even tell you why and you can end up either playing those matches without any rewards or forced to not to play ever again. This is a major problem who the hell thought this was a good idea?			",320,38,1,58,24,1,41

												DOTA 2 is my favorite way. The program lets me assume the role of another creature, helping me experience our oneness with the universe.I like to assume the position of the dinosaur-riding, lightning-wielding, half-lizard half-man. I like to join servers with up to nine other disciples, be “Disruptor” (as he is called), and go to the jungle, closing my eyes; there I concentrate on my breathing. The other disciples (woefully) always curse at me. I usually have to mute them. I do so to concentrate on being one with the virtual nature. (I can’t afford to go to national parks, so this is the best thing). Sometimes I see lots of colorful exclamations points and these “PING PING PING PING PING” sounds occur around my character. They are beautiful. One time someone said, “THE ♥♥♥♥?! LEVEL 1 DISRUPTOR, BUY COURIER YOU ♥♥♥♥ING RETARD!” And the truth is there are many players like him. They aren’t at peace with themselves. Perhaps if he came into the forest and hummed koans with me, and he had done so as the giant, walking tree, then he would see his greater consciousness. All the negative energy would leave his body, and we’d share a moment of experiencing our Buddha nature. In my experience, sessions last about 10-20 minutes. And initially it did not take long to find a server; apparently I’ve been moved to “low-priority matchmaking.” But that’s okay. I just assume the lotus position in my chair and wait patiently. The only downside to this is that sometimes I forget to click the ""accept"" button.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dota stands for ""Defense of the Ancients"", or as I like to call it, Dota. The two is not to refer to the game being a sequel, which it is, but rather to specify the number of ancients in a game. The objective is to turn it into Dota 1. In Dota, you need to defend an ancient, which is either a tree or a rock depending on your religious affiliation. Since I'm one and two-thirds Bhuddist, I usually end up defending one of them at random, much like all the other players. Dota is a very unique game, in that includes both offense and defense. There are lots of characters, and all of them are mostly good at different things. In my opinion, the best part of Dota is playing it. This is because Dota is an extremely unique combining many difficult strategies, such as attacking the enemy team's Ancient or defending your own Ancient. The goal of Dota, much like other games, is to win. If you become proficient at this skill, you will win very often, leading to more victories. Scientists show that six out of every three Dota players that win matches tend to be on the winning team when the game is over. This is because winning substantially increases your chances of not losing. Dota takes a while to learn though, and that is because it is an extremely offensive, yet defensive, game with many complicated nuances, like being a farmer or trying to help your teammates do good. One interesting feature of Dota is that dying is really bad, in the sense that you lose money and time because respawns are really long, like when Halo 3 would just beep at you instead of spawning you and you'd get really angry, except this is an intentional feature intended to spice up the classic innovation of offfense vs. defense vs. offense. Why did I write a third position in that last sentence? Excellent question. There are neutral enemies in the game, and they usually don't do a whole lot except sit there and be neutral. If you don't respect their space, however, you may find that they beging to fight back, much like an offensive form of self-defense. Early in a match of Dota, you find yourself buying useful items like tp scrolls, also called Town Portal Scrolls, or Town Portal Scrolls for short. Why did I mention Town Portal Scrolls multiple times? Good question! That is because there are multiple teams. Once you've bought items, you go kill enemy creeps, and they aren't people so it's ethically sound and completely morally fine to do. :) Once you've spilt some blood, or watched as they comically struggle to kill each other for your favor, you may realize that you have more money and have leveled up. That is because creeps are made of gold stitched together by experience and points, and that usually transfers to you after they die. Think of it like inheritance or maybe a n involuntary tribute system. Once you've levelled up and gotten rich, you can buy better items that make you stronger, and then get new abilities like skills, active abilities, passive abilities, or passive-aggressive abilities. These abilities let you hurt creeps and other palyers more effectively, which may or may not be socially acceptable in your region of birth. Please refer to local ethic codes and statutes to determine whether victory is a viable gameplay style for you in your chosen country of choice. Once you've become the best all-around person you can be, or at least made some incremental progress down that road that usually takes about an hour on average, (resets between games, so you never get bored) it's time to go tear down the other team's towers (those, like many buildings in the united states, canada, or certain US territories, will fight back and damage you) and then eventually go and destroy their Ancient, which is what the A stands for in Dota. That makes your team the winner, and implies that you are better people in a metaphorical sense than your enemy team counterparts.			",209,14,0,32,11,0,18

												I've been playing Dota since it was just a map created by iceFrog for Warcraft 3, so my played hours should be 1K++. Dota itself was the game which introduce me to a new genre called MOBA ( Multiplayer Online Battle Arena ), and it has various heroes that seems to be balance. Each hero has unique abilities along with items to help you develop hero the way you want. Also you can try to mix skill combos with your friends. Various skins has been added for some heroes, and even some skins can be collected through events or matches. So what's the problem?The problem is community, Dota has the worst community comparing to the other games that I play, and it gets worst everyday. I am aware that Dota has commend and report system but it seems nothing to do with matchmaking algorithm, at least it should be use as parameter to help 'kind' player play along with another 'kind' player, and it goes same with the 'rude' players.

												I played this game because friends asked me to. With 20 hours under my belt, I can safely say I still have absolutely no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ I'm doing.This game is NOT beginner-friendly. If this is your first MOBA, you need to start with something lighter, because DOTA 2 will completely overwhelm you. There's very little balance, players will treat you like trash (because most of the community is built of DOTA 1 players who already know the ins-and-outs) and you will struggle to find the right guides that will show you what you're doing wrong.If you're playing with friends who are much better than you, you'll only be holding them back. If you're playing with friends who are much worse than you, you'll grow tired of playing with them. DOTA 2 is like a fine wine -- a lot of fun for somebody experienced. Tastes like pee for a newbie.			",37,4,3,6,1,0,2

												League of Legends has the spanish, this has the russians.These two games have brought out a racist side in me that I never thought existed. While having 1000+ hours played in LoL, and developing a strong hatred for the spanish and any other culture that speaks something close to spanish, this game has also made me develop a hatred for the russian community. As you can see, I've only played 50 odd hours of this game at the time this review was made, but if I had to add at least ONE positive note to this review, its this. I've mananged to learn russian in only a few hours, grasping the most important phrase, ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"". This phrase runs through my mind, every day of every minute. I sometimes even say it to myself in my head IRL when I see someone doing something moronic. This game is a russian weapon developed by Putin himself to enslave the world, along with the help of whatever leader Brazil has right now.While most of the friends I play with play LoL, I quit that in order to seek refuge from the spanish epidemic there is over there, but instead, have been sucked into this South America/Russian racism simulator wasting most of the extra money I have on steam to buy cosmetic items for heroes I've just played. I never liked history when in school, I hated it, with a passion, just like the Americans with their hatred for the Russians. This game has taught me everything I need to know on why to hate russia, how to hate russia and question the very existance of that country based on the ape like intelligence that I've seen coming from the country.In short, if you've always been a saint in your life, never swore, never hated another culture, never thought of abusing everyone you know that doesn't speak english that well, then I'd suggest not playing MOBA's entirely, all jokes aside. If cancer had to be a game, this would be it. Without a thought. What valve has done, is develop a way of making World War 3 possible. Along with the help of Putin, and his various ape test subjects that I've encountered in the game.11/10 would keep playing.			",95,1,3,13,10,0,10

												It's a good game, a bit overated in my opinion. But defenitely okay to be in a top list! To say that it is one of the best ARTS/MOBA etc is really exageration, it's only like 3 years in existence, you need way more to compare it to HON, LOL or Smite.			",189,35,10,22,21,4,31

I nominated this game for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" AwardYou have an early day tomorrow. You need to get some sleep, so you’re just going finish one more match before you decide to tuck in for the night. Just one more. Wait, one more. What’s that you say? It’s 2:30 AM? Yep, most of you can relate.Overall, it's a solid MOBA game, like one of the reviewer said, it's not pay to win, the in game purchases are for cosmetic purpose only. The cons is that this is MOBA game, means you play with people, and people can be annoying sometimes. Well, maybe a lot. But the game provided options to play with AI, so you can still play alone.My Score - 9/10 for the game5/10 for the community ",6,3,0,1,0,0,0

												DOTA 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, that adopted most of its mechanics from the original DOTA Mod of Warcraft 3. Now, let's come to some of its features: - --> Once you understand the basics, and become good at the game (oh wait, everyone of us is a noob) , you will soon have a huge backlog of other games. :P--> Basically hat simulator. --> Can cause rage, anxiety and affect your mental state. (too many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, griefers)--> You make 1000 good moves in a game, and you won't be recognized. Go feed once and get reported.--> You will start putting aside other priorities. Ty Dota2.--> To sum it up, it has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community like most other MOBAs, unless you are insanely good at the game.10/10 Recommended! Best game ever played!			",97,18,3,5,7,1,6

												Over the last years I've played DOTA 2 a lot, with much joy and pleasure. I liked the characteristics of the game, it was very tactical. Team play was key and there had been lots of heroes with different stengths and weaknesses.With the patch 7.00 everything has changed. Heroes became interchangeable, especially due to the talent system. Weaknesses that needed to be compensated by farming suitable items in the past now just get gifted by a single talent point! It's just absurd to see how overpowered these talents are. Any kind of weakness, making a hero to what it is, is balanced out way to easy.In addition to that the role system is completely broken. If you e.g. want to play Crystal Maiden as a carry - one of THE support heroes in the game - there is no reason to not do it anymore. Every hero can play any role, making the drafting somehow pointless.With respect to the map changes I've no objections. In order to keep the game interesting in the long run, it makes sense to rearrange things from time to time. But other than that it's very painful to see the shift from the most balanced patch this game has every seen (6.88) to completely destroying the game's spirit (7.00). After more than 1000 hours playing this game, I've decided not continue as long as the talent system is not reworked or completely removed. If I would like to play this kind of game, I would play the original: Heroes of the Storm. Furthermore I don't want this game to be a exaggerated action brawler, like League of Legends. I want DOTA 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

													Dota is less of a game, more of a tool of self discovery. In fact, thinking of dota as a game at all is a mistake; games are designed to be enjoyable and fun. Enjoying yourself and having fun is the the lowest priority for those who play dota, (especially for those in low priority.) they prefer instead to stubbornly not enjoy themselves while simultaneously making sure nobody else is having any fun either.	Every facet of the game has been finely tuned to reflect the players personality to the point that each decision they make in game is synonymous with how russian they are they conduct themselves in their day to day lives, what kind of attributes they hold in high esteem and strive to emulate in pursuit of bettering themselves becoming the transcendent doto master they know they're destined to be.	Although it seems at first to be a team game of 5v5, this is a very shallow perspective which will correct itself after around fifteen minutes of your first game. Same goes for the goal of destroying the other teams towers, barracks and ancient. These objectives are simply filler while you forcibly and decisively assert your rightful dominance over your team via your mic or hastily written yet crushingly witty remarks in the chat. (don't worry about the other team, they're fighting amongst themselves and don't matter anyway – remember: you're better than your team-mates and it's inconceivable that there's any possibility you did or will ever do anything wrong, regardless of what may be transpiring before your very eyes.)	The interface and mini-map should be largely ignored in favour of committing your attention wholly to the chat box, here you can see the current state of the game clearer than anywhere else, it may take a while to understand some of the games many colloquialisms such as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥блять' and 'no courier gg my team are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ff', but don't worry if you can't understand, it's not so much about comprehension as asserting your right to say things that don't need to be said and are generally trivial and unhelpful. 	If you find yourself doing poorly and being shouted at by your team for feeding, don't fret. They are likely jealous of your superior skills and can't understand that they are actually the ones letting you down. Just remind yourself of that one game you had that went freakishly well and make fun of someone’s build.10/10 worst game ever.			",66,7,0,10,7,1,14

Think otherwise? Something that a trash player would say.The learning curve is infinite, nobody has ever completely mastered the game.Your individual skill is ranked and measured in a system that only counts your win/loss in a game where 5 players must work together to win.Don't bother narrowing your search results, all the Rusperu's are pretty much the same.

												After playing 1.500 hours (like there is 200 on the 2nd one) I have finally quit this game.Here is the reasons.1)Broken stupid♥♥♥♥♥meta , icefrog's nerfs and buffs. First of all the guy who makes all the balancing things doesn't even play the game itself. IF a hero gets picked too much in the pro scene , icefrog will nerf the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of that hero and make it unplayable (Exp:Ember Spirit). Or he just buffs a hero like Riki since the day he came in  Dota 2 (Riki is generally easy to counter in high skill pubs but he wrecks the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of new players) and nerf a hero like Crystal Maiden both nerfing her damage movespeed etc.2)THE ♥♥♥♥ING COMMUNITY+MATCHMAKING (+Russians on English Lang.) AND RANKED Aaand here we are at the best part of Dota , the community... It is filled with immature kids who will rage at you and say stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥like ''omfg u so noob'' ''learn2play♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' ''y u use midas on big creep'' , it's literally cancer for someone sensitive aganist stupidity . Believe me after spending hours and hours inside those people you will slowly become one of them or atleast it will cause depression + anger issues. Ranked system of Dota is just simply broken. There is no difference between a 3.5k player and a 1k player , it is all the same. The points are just there so some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can brag about his non existent 6k mmr lie.(Hell i typed a comment under a vid related to Dota some guy just came in and said he had 6k and you are a ♥♥♥♥ing noob you should kill myself omfg) And the public matchmaking, slightly better than ranked a little bit because 1 out of a KAJILLION BILLION CHANCE you can actually meet with people who are funny and nice to play with (i made a lot of friends like this) but believe me most of the time you pick EU server with ENG language you will get Russians who farm Dagon on CM in hardlane and never communicate with you. You will slightly learn Russian because these guys never speak English even if they know it and since they love to scream in mic (like idi nahuy pidor suka ♥♥♥♥♥ padaroshnik pizdec bla bla bla...) you will instantly learn MOTTHEEERR RRRRUSSIA ACCENT.+Either you will get (Not being racist here , but Dota really does make you racist) Esta muerto mexican fellas , Spanish people on American server (or Russians with 9000 ping). Btw don't ever write guides like I did. I innocently wanted to help the other new players with a few guides about the heroes I know really well. Some Armenian kid called me a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with his poor English. (For telling people to use Midas on the big creep in jungle camps to get a level advantage)  3)Lastly (Because i dont need to say anything more why this game is so piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥ing effects on you... Why do you even want to play this game , it is like eating an apple with 4000 worms inside.  Anyways arguing with a Dota player made me realise that this game completely destroys your social life and your ability  to think, go try it yourself try to say something opposite to these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s...(There is a big ''real life'' world for you to discover out here. Get a hobby instead of playing this.)So im done please never ever ever start playing this game.			",51,4,1,7,3,0,6

												This is basically dota 1 with an upgraded user interface and graphics. It’s still a work in progress but all in all this is what the original dota style gameplay needs if it’s going to increase its declining marketshare in the moba genre it itself once pioneered.The spectator interface for viewing live games is impressive and though it seems the matchmaking algorithm is not really active at the moment for a beta the parts that work do so rather well. The attack and spell animations are all reworked and changed in this version so even for old dota 1 vets there is much to learn that only comes with the experience of engaging in the matches themselves.If you can get an invite and you like the MOBA genre you will find far more to like than not. But as usual in these types of games it all comes down to how evenly paired both teams are in skill for a game to truly fire on all cylinders. ",2198,857,88,271,225,28,362

												You'll think you love this game but that's only when you're winning. Every lost match makes you feel down rather than entertaining you, and it is easy to see when you're losing in a match, usually around 10 mins in. So even you know you're going to lose because i.e. one of your teammates decides to troll or feed because they lost first blood, or someone just doesn't do well, you still have to play for another 20-50 minutes, and it feels like torture every single time.

												I cant willingly recommend this game to anybody and go to sleep at night knowing what I did. The best way to describe my relationship with this game is that I hop on discord almost every night after renting cars to awful people, and ask my canadian friend if he wishes to suffer with me. He will begrudgingly say yes and so we will join. We are paired with screaming, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, knuckle dragging south americans who also equally hate themselves, and then indulge in the most masochistic and unpleasent videogame experience you could ever imagine. You can spend 45 minutes solid winning, and then one mistake turns the whole thing up on its head. But what is the worst part?You will never be satisfied. If you win you just nod your head sadly, because you know an hour of your life is gone forever, if you lose, you just laugh at yourself and shrug, saying ""what did I expect, look what I am doing with myself"". You can never get that hour of your life back. The cycle repeats every night, forever. If you hate yourself, you will find solace in the fact that you have a safe way of reliquishing your pain. Truly only the mad, the self loathing, the angriest, and the stupidest people play dota 2 willingly. If you count yourself amoung those, I welcome you to the community.Welcome.. welcome to the dumpster...where you belong.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like to watch the hours of your youth drip away like sand through an hour glass, then this is the game for you. If you like watching snotty know it all's get crushed in all too ironic ways by the enemy, then this is the game for you. If you like the sweet sting of success being ruthlessly snatched away from you as the enemy ploughs through your advance on their base like a warm knife through butter, then this game is for you. If you like low level intensity games, where even if you lose, your pride stays intact, or games that don't have you swearing like a Tarantino film at the screen over the smallest thing....then this game is not for you.Dota2 is like cyber cocaine.

												Hi. I only recommend you this game if you love MOBAs, but I didn't like MOBAs and now I have 1200 hours in it. I was a COD player, an MW2 player. Of course you will not be ''pro'' in your first matches. To be good you need a lot of training. If you played LoL and you have 30 lvl its sure you know the ""basics"". In this game the most important thing is the ""Last Hitting"" at the start, because if you have more gold and XP than your enemy, you own the game. The game may be boring, but if you have friends it won't be. I think the boring part is the first 13 lvl because you can't play some gamemodes before that. If you are new here you need to complete the training! If you are totally new here completing the training will get you a Sniper set. No the setts doesn't give you any bonus, just the enemy can see how rich you are. These decorative items have degree: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythical, Immortal, Old and Arcane. This items can be Normal, Auspicious, Heroic, Cursed and Unusual. So these were the decorative items lets talk about the in-game items! You start with 625 gold each hero have their own item build. I recommend you the Healing Slave, Tango and clarity items, this items will fill your HP or your mana. If you are new or never played that hero before i recommend you the guides (Up left the book icon). I recommend you the GreyShark(RU/UA) builds or Purge(ENG) builds.Thank you for reading this review. #P3D0'#Hungarian#DotA2fan			",121,16,4,8,6,2,15

Updated review, after clocking 500 hours and understanding what the game is aboutDota 2. A game with a massive learning curve that requires nothing apart from your game knowledge and good habits to excel at.Don't get into this game if you're not willing to learn a lot or sacrifice plenty of your time.Once you reach a high skill level, you understand the game at its core and you also find the right people to play with this game is the most enjoyable game you can possibly play. That is if you have the patience to get there.The community is great overall, the game is flawless. Valve is doing a great job with this one.Competitive scene is the healthiest I've seen, and I've watched countless competitive matches. So damn entertaining.Just look at this!

Now what has changed ever since I written the review back in 2013?Well, the new client has been ported that offers better things on the interface and support aspect and brings in new things like a slew of Custom Games you can play apart from Dota2. This game started originally as a mod for Warcraft III and I'm happy to see it has gone full circle to such an extent that the original W3 can be made entirely in the Dota2 client.As a flagship Valve game, you can expect bright things in the future, as the competitive scene flourishes.The only answer is: Do you want to play a moba?If you like:- free games- polished games- playing with a team- playing with friends- cosmetics & spending money for them- hard games- e-sports If you are okay with:- spending a lot of time playing games- learning a lot of complicated things- getting yelled at by russiansThen Dota2 is a game for you.

												I don't care about Dota 2. Never did, but I always loved to play as the Paladin in Warcraft 3 (Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne) in battle.net solo ladder matches. If you played ladder in that game, you know that nobody selects the Paladin as their main or even secondary hero. I obviously lost a lot, but I had fun. Then the custom maps (5 corridors, footmen rush, dota, etc) came out where I could play as a single hero. I enjoyed those maps a lot since I could victoriously play as the Paladin. So when Dota 2 came out and it had the Paladin in it, I was all in!In all my hours played in Dota 2 I only played as Omniknight. I already stopped playing this game since it was time to move on, but I couldn't just leave my Paladin without saying goodbye so I created my Omniknight guide where I just opened my soul and let the juices flow. That Dota 2 Steam guide is now on page 1 (out of 4000 pages) of ""Top Rated All Time"".

												After 7.0 update the game is completely ruined. Unjustified ballance changes, dubios talent tree mechanics addition and questionable map alterations. All that is just nothing, compared to how bad the user interface is. Plain, distracting, out of color scheme. It bears no real functionality, rather than irritate the player. I have strong impression, that a person, responsible for UI and his team, is kind of ""look Mom, i'm a designer"" type. Not sure what is worse, the UI itself, or the fact that it has somehow made through quality assurance testing.While I have no particular sentiments in regards to actual game changes, and probably would live through that, the new UI turned atmospheric game into a soulless junk. I strongly suggest dev team to consider integrating new features into old UI, both in terms of apperance and functionality, rather than doing pityful attempts like this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.Enjoy!			",15,1,0,4,1,0,0

												I really can't say anything other then this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Look at all the hours I've spent in the game. You all are probably like ""well, there are these people who have spent thousands of hours in the game, so that's not many."" But do take into account that my total time owning this game hasn't even exceeded a year yet. There is not a day I remember since I got this game that I haven't at least opened DOTA 2. Usually to play a public game, sometimes to play a bot game, and sometimes to brush up on hero knowledge and look at guides. This game will ruin your life and obliterate all your free time. My only warning to new players is that the community it pretty toxic to new players, and not everyone speaks english. Just mute anyone calling you a noob, flaming you, etc. But never do so to the people that legitimately want to help you.Overall Rating: 11.6/10.			",15,3,0,6,1,0,3

												This game is great! - It ruined my social life.- I now abuse Russians I've known for years IRL.- Anybody who's better than you is a basement dweller.- Anybody worse than you is from South America.- Possibly the worst community in gaming after LoL.- Bad graphics and controls, 10/10 - IGNI have spent too long on this game, and I'm by no means the worst offender. I wish I could get those hours and money back.Overall, this game is the cancer of Steam. 10/10.			",21,5,0,1,0,0,3

												Hello everybody. First I would like to introduce myself :) . OK my name is etro, who has a hobby of playing a lot of games like skyrim, minecraft,pokemon, and etc. OK here's the point when I played dota 1, the first try of the game was hard and I really can't understand it very much. The moment I played dota 2 , that's how I realize and understands the game so the thing that I'am saying dota2 or valve can explain better than dota 1 (no offense , ice frog) so I would gladly recommend playing dota2 than dota 1 for the first try of the game :).                     Others say that dota 2 is not a good game or a bad game (well we all have our opinions :) ). For me it's the best game of all the time :D. I respect the Lol (league of legends) players. Even though they are saying that dota 2 sucks. Here in my country (philippines) many Filipinos say that they like Lol better. But I really don't get their point I mean (no offense to the Lol makers and producers) but Lol kinda copied dota 1 ( I don't even know if Lol have their permissions or paid icefrog for copying the main idea of dota) but valve paid icefrog for dota 2 so it means valve have their license while Lol doesn't have. I don't really know guys if Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog. But I think they didn't ask for permissions or paid ( if im mistaken please correct me or you can just tell me to remove this review. And im sorry if im mistaken that Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog.but i really think they didnt. Well the real point in this paragraph is I will play or follow the one who have permmisions or paid and that is dota 2 or (valve).If your noob or getting annoyed it's OK cause we all started like noobs :) and just ignore the people who are saying that you're noob,stupid,idiot, they will just annoy you and they have no hearts (they are monsters). Anyway for them to easily ignored just press the heroes panel at the upper left of the screen. In there you can see a speaker's icon then press it and wahhla you muted the player you chossed. I hope this really helped you guys :)OK thank you guys for reading my review with this game. I hope you recommend this :) bye.			",12,2,0,3,0,0,0

												I've played this game since it was a mod for Warcraft, and I have to say, it's one of the best games I've ever played {mechanics wise}. However, it has more than it's fair share of problems.For starters, this game has a stupidly high learning curve. There's no one true way to play any of the 100+ heroes, and it can get very frustrating very fast trying to find what you can easily work with for any of them with the gigantic selection of items. Even all these years later, theres still only a small pool of heroes that I'm confident enough with to pick on a regular basis, while the rest of the roster is more or less alien to me, with my success {or lack thereof, which is normally the case} depending largely on the skill level of the enemy team and my teammates. Which brings us to the next point.90% of the people who play this game are stupid. Now, I'm by far not the best at this game. I'm slightly above average at best, absolute best. However, it's hard to improve myself, or even play on anything outside of solo bot servers when I'm constantly thrown in with stupid people, first timers, people who don't speak the server regions language, people who are only there to prance around in costumes, or don't want to follow simple orders/use common sense. Or any combination of the above. Meanwhile, I can rest assured that my opponents will almost always have their act together, and be an unstoppable force that I desperatly try to at least slow down. Which is made even harder when my teammates insist on throwing themselves into unwinnable battles, further feeding the enemy until the point where there's a 10+ level gap between me and the lowest leveled enemy. On the other hand, I might go up against a team that's super bad. As in, it's a game that lasts less than 20 minutes. In which case, I've learned nothing, and my time is wasted just as thoroughly as it would be against people out of my league. Or, on the {insanely rare} occasion that I get teammates that know what they're doing, I can expect them to whine about my choice of hero, my starting items/abilities, my lane choice, or god forbid, my costume. At which point, 9/10 of these people will purposefully feed the enemy or go afk, and then either rage quit or spend the rest of the match trolling and flaming. Or they might report me to try and get me thrown into low priority, which is Dota's equivalent of hell. And unlike most other multiplayer games, theres no dropping out whenever you wish without taking a heavy penalty for doing so. So have fun being in matches where there will be almost no fun a majority of the time.Now, there is a report system, which in theory, is supposed to shoo away the people that don't need to be playing this in the first place. In practice, it's horribly broken, due to being automated. Doing amazingly well, but you're the odd man out in a Peruvian 4 stack that you've somehow managed to offend? Expect to have the low priority message pop up when you exit to the menu after the match. Maybe you want to report your support who refused to place wards, started feeding, and ended up with a score of 0/25? The entire server could report them, but they could still easily slip through without getting lp. In all seriousness, it's down to luck if it does work when it's needed, and doesn't when it's being abused.Up next, hero balance. Thankfully, this isn't quite as bad as it could be, but there is still silliness here and there. Some heroes have one or two overpowered abilities, while others are all around unbalanced, and others still are in sore need of buffing. Some are literally useless outside of certain situations {Nyx Assassin requiring the enemy to have supports/squishy heroes to operate}, while others are universally helpful {Crystal Maiden's aura always being a big help}. At the same time, some heroes are nicely balanced, but are easily outclassed by other heroes who can perform the same role, only much better and easier. Why pick Legion Commander and eventually out damage the enemy team using skill, when you can pick Ursa and out damage them from level 3 onwards with only a single keystroke? Why pick Weaver and alternate between your 2 escapes when you can pick Storm Spirit and have an escape with no cooldown? Why pick Centaur Warrunner to be durable when you can pick Axe and be so tanky that the lane gets locked down for your enemy? There's tons of examples like this. You'll also see some heroes almost every match, {Pudge, Sniper, Zeus, who all have skills that can be more or less mindlessly spammed/have low risk high reward play styles.} but many are seen rarely outside of higher tier comp play {Io, Meepo, Dark Seer, who all take some degree of skill/have high risk decent reward play styles}. And none of it is helped by Valve making nonsensical buffs and nerfs, almost all of which are based on tournaments, what with them either hammering heroes that are frequently picked/do really well, and overly buffing heroes that aren't picked often to encourage picking them.As with TF2, Valve is rapidly turning this into another hat simulator. I played a ton of the original Dota, and I sure don't remember any customization, because that would have been silly. This game is hard enough without your idiot teammates being distracted by someone's super pimped out loadout, or worrying about getting a nice drop {if any, only 2-3 people usually get drops at the end of the round}. The main problem with character customization though, is that much like TF2, it attracts half wits that only want to play the super easy characters and dress them up, then look down on everyone else who isn't wearing a 20c wolf hat. Yeah, take your little wolf hat into a ranked match, and see how they like it. Also like TF2, Valve focuses more on cosmetic items than the actual gameplay itself, which started off small, but in recent months has led to them:1. Canceling popular game modes, in order to {in their own words} 'focus more on cosmetic sets'.2. Building entire game modes around expensive sets {although in fairness, said sets only enhanced the modes/tracked stats for them, but still...}, or just flat out making new modes pay to win {the Year Beast Brawl was p2w to the point that disgusting amounts of money and cheap tactics trumped genuine skill almost 100% of the time}.3. Doing inane things like changing the perfectly fine models of heroes, and then using that as an excuse to make more money {Shadow Fiend's model was just fine, but then he got a redesign that looked like an angsty 12 year old made it, and a $35 cosmetic that looked like an even more angsty 10 year old designed it}.4. Possibly the worst, outright ignoring critical server issues to focus on cosmetic item bugs {also during the YBB, Valve ignored their own failing servers that were crashing every 10 or so minutes, and instead focused all of their efforts on making sure Crystal Maiden's hair didn't despawn when she died. No, really, word for word, the lone note in that patch was ""Fixed a rare, yet extremely common, embarrassing hair problem for Crystal Maiden""}.Overall, the game would be greatly improved if Valve would do the following things:1. Mandatory region locking for everyone, to heavily cut down on the language barrier.2. Making the tutorial required for new players.3. Restricting pvp until profile level 5, and ranked matches until at least 20, both to make it harder for new players to come in with zero idea of how to play in a live match, and to make it harder on smurfers who only live to troll ranked.4. Making the game pay to play again, which would encourage people to actually care about doing good/not have 20+ alt accounts for trolling and smurfing.As fun as this game is, I reccomend it to no one, other than someone willing to go through absolute misery to occasionally have fun.

												 I'm going to start off with I'm a fan of Dota, it is an interesting and fun game requiring team synergy and tactical awareness. It's design is wonderfully built, its ui is easy to use, and it's all around entertaining. It's intuitive and original, and stands out in contrast with many other MOBAs. It's provided me with hours of fun. I've even invited several people to the game. Now then, everything said above is no longer true, the out-of-game ui is still fantastic, but soon as you get in-game you have to ask yourself, ""Where the ---- is anything?"" you either need a magnifying glass or superior far-sighted vision. The characters are overbalanced so unless you build a perfect team together, better luck next game. It looks like the Dev team hit copy and paste with League of Legends, the usefullness of map awareness is negated.  Here, while we're putting our feet in our mouths let's do the most unoriginal character EVER, Wukong! That's right, Dota 2 is home to the most overused character on the planet, he's better than ever with a nearly perfect identity with every other MOBA on the web. Let's assume our players are willing to get headaches to play, so back to the ui, the WHAT? It's invisible, it's transparent, it's the new big THING! It's the most beautiful NOTHING you'll never lay eyes on! Oh, and you wanted to scale it? Haha, Valve thinks you're funny. Honestly, if you're going to update a game, PLAYTEST it, how is that difficult? Oh, there IS a test server you say? Who cares! Let's release all this unstable crap on our unsuspecting players. 1 report is given in a 3-6 month period. That's right, if you want to report someone SAVE it for that VERY special someone, cuz you only get one chance! Commends the same way? Well, my commends haven't refreshed since october, want to know why? Cuz I play support, and my overall average scores are lower as a result. You hold on to that hope that they'll fix things, and they usually do... briefly. I've spent money on the game, know what that means? Nothing, cuz unless you unload your whole bank your words aren't even heard. Sometimes I wonder if everyone at Valve who interacts with Dota keep cats around so they can sleep on the keyboard when they decide to start trilling away ideas. When one thing breaks, break everything else to fix it. ""Hm, I hear the Dota community is great... let's go try."" No no, great in this case means the rudest and cruelest gamers. If you don't have a whole group of friends to play with you get stuck with trolls or people who use their faces for they keyboards. This isn't true if you play on foreign servers, but even still it is a gambit. Great white ---. This is Dota 2 not League of Legends 2 Update score, UI ~~ 0>/10 Lore ~~ 4/10 (Monkey King? Really?) Stability ~~ 2/10 Entertainment 3/10 Contrast. UI ~~ 8/10 Lore ~~ 7/10 Stability ~~ 5/10 Entertainment ~~ 9/10I'd love to love the game again.			",20,0,0,10,2,0,2

												Dota 2 is one of the most spectacular MOBA games ever. It went through a lot of changes and updates. When I start playing Defence of the Ancient it wasn't that much donation and sets. But what we see now? The amount of sets is too damn high, the creators just makin' money, you can't even define the character by some of it's stuff. Also, sin not to mention the community. It is smth terrible and disgusting, I played only 50 games out of 1100 without trash talking about me and my relatives. Just think about it, is it normal? Dota 2 literally is like narcotic, you should pass a long way to stop playing it. I wasted 1,118.4 hours in the shuffle. It is the biggest regret in my life 'till now. Take thought, does this stupid game worth your own time, money and nerves? I don't think so and that's why I don't recommend this game to any of YOU!			",175,44,4,16,9,4,11

												Dota or Defense of the Ancients, was the first of its kind, and originally started off as a Warcraft 3 custom map but it quickly grew to become one of the most popular games in the world as well as spawning a whole new genre which we know today as MOBAs. The game is simple, 5v5, 3 lanes and both teams' objective is to destroy the other teams' Ancient.There are over 100 heroes in the game each with their own unique skills and attributes and forming a well rounded team with synergy is key to victory. Closing notes -The community can be awful. You will get yelled at, flamed and even reported for making mistakes. If you can overcome this, the game is amazing.			",40,5,0,2,2,0,2

You want me to say some words about Dota 2?Here it goes:• Cyk@ and axaxaxaxa are the only phrases you'll only ever have to use to communicate.• Don't be decieved by the server names, as every server is a Russian server.• I'd recommend never to play this game with friends, as your friendship will be destroyed into tiny pieces.• Phantom Assassin is the source of all depression.• Going into the depths of low priority is like taking a trip to hell with no way back.• You better be lucky if you random otherwise you'll probably get Earth Spirit.• If you're afraid of rats don't play this game as there's a gigantic one named Nature's Prophet.• Pray to the Lord that you'll never be against Spirit Breaker because his name doesn't lie.But somehow I keep coming back to the game.gg wp Valve 10/10			",356,73,9,31,26,7,41

												Much of what you have heard of DOTA 2 is probably true. It is an often cruel, tricky to approach and that requires huge amounts of time to master. It is these characteristics, however, to make it a game unique depth and the potential rewards that can give a feeling of ""conquest"", actually earned a high price, and therefore real, tangible. All this long to find, in a relatively short time, a team more or less sets of people with whom it is possible to cooperate and communicate effectively, since the nature of the deep tactical gameplay makes it almost impossible to be accompanied by casual players and hope to derive mutual benefit and fun, especially in the long term. Now that DOTA 2 is available for all, the challenge of numbers with the main competitor League of Legends can begin. In the face of a rock starting even steeper, Valve from its experience exceptionally balanced and truly free from the need to open your wallet, not counting infrastructure for the live broadcast of the games can be the envy of every Another developer MOBA. If the work on accessibility will continue in the right direction, this could make the confrontation one of the most exciting and interesting in recent years.			",106,6,5,11,6,1,5

												This game has the worst community in gaming, and I say that with zero exaggeration.You might say to yourself ""I'm different. My friends and I are nice guys. We won't become one of THOSE moba players.""  But I stongly urge you not to underestimate this game's ability to make people like you into monsters.  You may see yourself and your friends transform into worse versions of yourselves every time you launch the game, and you may even start to turn on each other.  You may blow up at a friend or teammate one day and you'll wonder how you ever got so salty.Also, Dota is highly addictive, but not in a good way.  The more you play Dota, the less you'll enjoy other games until eventually Dota is the only game that can satisfy you, and that's just not healthy.If you play this because it's one of the only games that runs on your school laptop, I understand... But do yourself a favor and build a proper gaming PC so you can rise out of the toxic cloud and experience the vast awesomeness of the PC gaming library.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really love this game, and if you like moba then you should try it, the gameplay should not be hard to understand, a big map divided into three routes (Top, Mid and Bot), two teams of 5 players (5vs5), many heroes with different ability and tasks (support, carry, tank), the goal of the teams is to reach the enemy base by destroying enemy tower and minions, there are lots of mechanical and things to learn but it'svery simple if you take time to read a guide or/and play the tutorial. one suggestion is to not get depressed by elitist person who will tell you things like: F**k you, your dad, F***ing SS! etc. because there are lot of people like that.however, in my opinion what makes dota different from other moba is the tactics / strategies usable, well balanced (recently I've some doubt xD), based heavily on skills, a lot of heroes to choose to play and have fun with, totally free and frequently updated.one of the biggest problems I found is communication, for example when you select EU server and English language, the game start and is most of time like..Me: Hello guys ^^Team:привет другTeam:merhaba arkadaşımTeam:Hola amigaTeam:朋友你好			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This 7.00 disaster/deevolution/downgrade is most likely the worst thing that has happened in history of gaming. As far as I am concerned, the game is dead and whoever calls this 7.00 abomination 'dota' is simply wrong, least to say. Last few patches including reborn weren't good in my opinion as in many other people's opinions, but we have accepted them with not much grief. However, this 7.00 nonsense is far beyond of all bad patches including those of dota 1 combined. It is, least to say a drastical change in wrong direction. So if you want to try the game, just know that you are not playing Dota, you are playing something else that can't stand any near to Dota. I would rate Dota 2 as it was in last few patches 8/10, somewhere between 2013-mid of 2015, I would rate 10/10 and this 7.00 hell is at best 2/10 and I don't think it will get any better in its worthlessness. I want to put my money on bet that this is the worst update in gaming history. Was good till it lasted, I will miss the game very much.			",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wasted my 2.714 hours on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, and so I can say something about that game.Will you start Dota 2? Be sure you'll get anger problem cause of this game. Because most feeders and idiots will come to your game. Also not need to talk about Russians, you probably heard something about them. Just speaking their languange in EU servers, instead RU server. If you are playing on EU, why you are not using English instead Russian you moron? Also, be sure Dota 2 will not do anything about feeders, optimization etc. They are not giving a f*ck about that optimization sh*t... It doesnt matters how many times you report your enemy or allied players. They can feed, and they can f*ck our game. It's normal for Valve. No low priority to them. You can think I am writing those words after a match, if you though that, you are totally right. I cant understand why did I just waste my valuable time with this game...........

On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve's Source engine. The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.If you're not aware of the basics of the burgeoning MOBA genre, two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map. Each team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structure--in Dota 2's case, the Ancient--in the opposing team's base. With most games lasting around the 40-minute mark, and occasionally edging past an hour, watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff.Aiding these two teams, named the Radiant and the Dire, are waves of AI assistants, called creeps. Batches of creeps spawn at 30-second intervals and charge merrily up the map's three pathways. In the clumps of remaining land lies a jungle, where numerous AI opponents spawn, offering lucrative benefits to players who take them on successfully. Finally, and in a bid to stop both teams from simply marching into one another's base, each team gets three powerful towers on each lane that easily shred through enemy players at the start of the game.Your individual ability to control and affect the rhythm of the game comes from how well you handle your hero. You mostly control a single unit in Dota 2, though there are exceptions: some heroes can summon controllable allies, such as bears, gargoyle babies, or wolves; one exceptionally versatile hero can split into three; and one item lets you take control of certain creeps. For each rule in Dota 2's impressive house-of-cards design, there's usually at least one character who completely ignores it, or finds a way around it via one of 130-odd items available from the in-match shop. For instance, try negating magic attacks with the black king bar, returning damage with the blade mail, or pounding out two ultimate abilities in quick succession with a refresher orb.The aim for most players is to accumulate as much gold and experience as possible, with income being delivered mostly by scoring the killing blow on enemy creeps and players. It's almost always easier to gang up on stray enemies as a group, which is why it's rarely a good idea to run about on your own. Then it's a case of splashing all your hard-earned money on some ultra-powerful items from the shop, while levelling up your base stats and abilities, and then clobbering the enemy team into submission via a few five-versus-five team fights. Rarely does it feel that simple, however.At the time of writing, 102 of the original Dota's 112 heroes have made their way into the sequel. Each hero has a handful of unique abilities and generally works best in a specific role, such as supporting other players as Omniknight, roaming around the map looking for opportunistic kills as Spirit Breaker, or evolving throughout the course of the game into an all-powerful vehicle of carnage and destruction as Phantom Assassin.There's only one map, unlike in many other MOBA titles, although Valve has not ruled out the addition of more over time, and has previously offered game-changing modes with seasonal events at Halloween and Christmas. But Dota 2's single sprawling map sets itself apart from the competition by being larger, more intricate, and packed with greater detail than the rest of the genre. Unlike in League of Legends, the jungle area is riddled with far more tangling pathways, the lanes feature additional shops selling exclusive items, and savvy players are given more opportunities to use the environment to hide, flee, and ambush their opponents.There are multiple layers of additional information that become increasingly relevant as you invest more time in the game. How do you effectively divide your forces? When should your team attempt to vanquish Roshan, the map's most powerful creep? What are runes? What's the significance of the fact that creeps get slightly stronger every seven and a half minutes?Often the game's dizzying scale is seen as off-putting or simply too complex, but the truth of Dota is that it can be entertaining as a new player to just sit down and let all those extraneous factors play out around you. Getting down to the brass tacks of the game with a group of like-minded friends is a lot of fun: start by buying your characters' recommended items, try your best not to get caught out of position, and get into the habit of buying observer wards. And watch out for Riki.As you'd expect from Valve, this is a beautifully presented game, with the Half-Life and Portal maker running victory laps around its competition in terms of UI, voice acting, and showing how to deftly add real personality to its characters. Only recently has the developer turned its attention to gently easing new players into the proceedings, however, and even now, mastering the basics feels like learning to swim by jumping in at the deep end. Efforts are being made to remedy this, though: right now there are a couple of tutorial levels, some well-designed AI bots, and a newbie playlist that restricts hero selection to just 20 of the most frequently picked characters. And with community-created hero guides now built directly into the game itself, Dota 2 is much easier to get started with than it has been in the past.Play a match every evening for a couple of weeks, and you start to see how Dota 2's wealth of disparate systems and mechanics combine into their own harmony, and you begin to understand how there are hundreds of elements that affect the game. Dota 2 is a tense war of accumulation and attrition. The biggest problem, which is coincidentally where the real excitement of the game lies, comes from struggling to process and interpret dozens upon dozens of mitigating circumstances while simultaneously trying to keep your cool.It is a complicated and exhausting game, and for the first few weeks, it's challenging just keeping up with the general rhythm of a match. But invest enough time into Dota 2, and you develop an almost unconscious ability to keep up with the game--performing actions such as sending the slightly fiddly in-game courier over to the faraway ""secret"" shop to get some rare items, for instance. After a couple of hundred hours of Dota 2, what once felt like spinning plates just happens automatically.While Dota 2 has transferred the core of the original Dota into a cleaner, modern engine, the fact remains that losing is uniquely painful. Death in Dota 2 not only gives your opponent money, but robs you of some of your own and leaves you waiting up to a minute to respawn. By the time you've trudged back across the game's massive map--or spent money on a teleportation scroll--your opponent is now stronger and richer. Die two or three times in quick succession, which is easily done, and a match of Dota becomes a painful experience where you spend the next half hour getting bullied by an increasingly superior enemy. Other games in the genre have tried to mitigate this punishment, but Dota 2 positively revels in its complexities. The rich just get richer.Give it a go!			",173,54,4,24,20,3,14

Posted: January 10, 2014
												One of my favorite games in my library. My play time reflects how much time I have spent appreciating the team work and competitive spirit of the game. Supports who actually support the team, carries who can carry the team to victory, and players who can execute a base push as timely as the New York Sunway. By the way, I love subway sandwiches. I eat a BLT without the T almost every week. Bacon is the most delicious meat. Lettuce is like the cup to the tea party. You can't have tea without water, and you can't hold water without cups. Unless of course you use your hands. Or your mouth. But lettuce cups are pretty delicious. So imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creatures known as tomatoes. Which while they rhyme with potato, don't taste anything similar. If potatoes tasted like french fries, tomatoes would taste like awful fried wet vegetables. Speaking of wet tables, If you put water on tables, it gets wet. Not stuff like multiplication tables that are way too complicated. What is 6X6? Its like 64 or something. Which is like 10 if you add them all together. What does that mean? I am not sure. Math is hard. Unlike DOTA2. Which is a great game. Especially as a carry.Actually I never played carry before. It seems like a pretty easy job though.Just kill things until you win the game. That is a pretty simple job description. Unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle. I mean jungle is a location, how is it a job? It is more like a forest than a jungle. I mean jungles have lions and stuff right? Forests have angry bears. I am not sure where man-birds and horse-men are from though. Horses aren't jungle creatures I think. They sound more like mountain creatures to be honest. I haven't seen a troll before or a gnoll, but I bet they are forest creatures as well too. So jungle should really be called forest.Mid is a pretty self explanatory position. Its the middle of the map lane. Like if you had 3 lanes, he would take the second one. Or she. There are female heroes as well. Are they called heroines? Well I wouldn't want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug. That would be sexist. I mean playing Lina is pretty addicting though. Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire .Its like if you had a charmander and combined it with a jynx. Thats what lina is. Which reminds me that pokemon recently came out. X and Y are pretty popular with my friends, so I wamt a 3DS. Those things cost money though, but I head I can trade my items for cash. That sounds pretty amazing. Earning money while palying games, its like the American dream for people who don't want actual jobs. Not that I have a job yet. All I do is stay home and read manga. Which is pronounced mane gah, Like mango but with an a. I sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaaa.So offlane is the lane opposite of the safe lane. So the dangerous lane as they would call it. It isn't very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guys. Its like chinese vampires and running water. I don't think they can cross running water. Many they would have a hard time with modern day plumbing. One flush of the toilet and the go poof. Or do they? I actually know nothing about chinese vampires. I only know vampires from the books my friends lent me. It was the Twilight saga. I really preferred the Jacob to the other guy though. I was pretty upset when Bella made the wrong choice. I mean who wouldnt want a guy you could play fetch whenever you wanted. Plus the other guy was like 439434 years old. Yuck!So Support is the last job you can play. Not only do you provide moral support because most teams don't ever have asupport, but you also help buy buying items no one else in their right minds would buy. Like a slave donkey to carry your items for you. He can even be given magical wings for more than his actual buying price. Why wouldn't I want another donkey instead of one flying one? I am pretty sure two donkeys are cooler than one flying one. I mean how would you even catch a flying donkey? It could poop from like 60 feet and it would be awful. Like a divebombing terrible smelling equine terror. But donkeys are pretty cute. So keep them on the ground. If donkeys were meant to fly, god would have evolved them wings instead of using magic.  So that is Dota. Its a pretty good game. But it has some problems too. After all, even BLT's have T's. Here are the digusting parts of the BLT. Games take a while to finish. So if you tend to have sudden gas attacks like me, you might have an accident while you are playing a particular game. A game of Dota can last from as long as 30 seconds to 50 hours. Like I am not even joking how troublesome it is to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of Dota. I mean look at my avatar. That is my face for like the first 5 minutes of Dota before my legs fall asleep and I start getting cramps. It also has too many different heroes. I think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7. It would also encourage faster hero picking if the last 3 players couldn't choose any hero. It is a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero picks an all fire team and the lumberjack hero. You are literally counterpicked because you chose too early. It would be better to give some kind of gold option or a repick option. Some game modes take forever. Like captains draft can be much shorter if they removed all the bans. Sometimes I want to make team electric, but then a ban comes up and I accidentally ban Mr. Thunder or the masked electric emo. Then Team thunder is ruined. I can understand why bans could be good though. Cause everyone chooses fat butcher guy. He uses his hook to hug you then you smell him to death. Sometimes he tickles you for extra damage. What is worse is that he eats you, he gets fatter and stronger. The biggest tomato of the problem is the fact that the game has too much action, but not enough story. Its like worse than Dynasty Warriors when it comes to story. I could use a few cutscenes telling me why I am teaming up with a giant spider, a porcupine, a baby rock, and a angel man. At least there was a reason in Dynasty Warriors 7 about why I am fighting Guan Yu with my hated enemies the filthy Wu. Were those filthy Wu actually even men? The way they fought with their cowardly fire arrows and powerful navy instead of facing the numerically and superiorly led enemy army head on just screams uncultured barbarians. So I think I will give the game a 1/10/14. Its a pretty good game, but the lack of story gives it only a 1 in that category. I understand that every hero has its own lore, but the bigger connection is quite lost when I team up with my biggest rival against my best friend. A 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game. People play like men instead of filthy Wu women. But Ali, why the 14 and not a 17? Because the game has that huge tomato. And I hate Tomatoes. I love BLT's without the T. BL is the greatest invention of man, till someone introduced the uncessary T. I would have BL everyday if I could afford it, but I have no job and spend all my time reading manga.    ",31,4,4,1,2,0,4

But I just wanted to put my two cents in the fold, and for all the other vets out there.Valve, you ♥♥♥♥ed up.  Big League.7.00 will be the beginning of the end.  I can't stand the game I grew to love so much anymore. I hope that some of these changes get reverted in due time, but until then, I won't log another hour.  I hope you're happy with yourselves.

												I hate Dota 2. I hate it with a passion >:(It is not that the game itself is bad - really, it is rather fun (albeit somewhat repetitive given the lack of change in the battlemap - same map, every time. Same hide-spots, same store locations, etc. - though during events sometimes some minor artistic features will be changed).In any case, a simple game as far as setting variety (or lack thereof) goes, but a neat idea. Lots of variation with the heroes, though some are considerably more powerful than others - not the best job balancing them, in my opinion.The problem with Dota 2 is really the community, which is LoL-style atrocious. In all the times I played Dota 2, I met a grand total of 2 friendly people (both in Bot matches). I met a massive number of people who were just downright nasty. Pushy, demanding, immature (not in the fun way), unnecessarily combative. Just unpleasant to work with - not that there ever seemed to be much teamwork in this ""team"" game.I suspect the atrocious community is why steam added the reporting system, but really that just made things worse. The system is frequently abused, leading to players constantly reporting each other for made up things ""just because"", or out of bitterness at losing, or because you don't switch (upon their demand) to speaking Spanish/Russian in the English-language-filtered server, etc.This over-reporting wouldn't be an issue if steam actually followed up to see if the reports had any merit (and maybe removed the reporting option from players who constantly sling false accusations) - but from what I've seen there appears to be no such oversight (hardly surprising - there really is no incentive for valve to follow up).Getting reported kicks you into ""low priority"" matches, which basically means that you have to go up against humans (other players in this awful community) who have also been reported and kicked into low priority. There is a certain number of matches you must play in low priority before you are free to once more play the matches you want (also locks you out of bot matches). There doesn't seem to be any appeals process for this.Oh, you can also get shuttled into low priority for spending ""too long"" without getting experience. So, if you are playing Techies (one of the heroes) and want to go out and spend a few minutes planting mines, the game may just decide that you have ""abandoned"" and kick you into low priority.Anyway, I think I've wasted about enough of my time warning you off.It's a free game (last I checked), so I imagine you'll download and play it anyway. Be my guest. Maybe these things won't bother you :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played this game for a pretty long period of time (~5 years) and obviously I liked it very much but at the same time I hated this game for being too toxic and cancerous. You don't enjoy this game 50% of your time. Just not worth the time you waste. Furthermore this game requires the ability to cope with cancer and toxicity of its community. You better play with your friends than queue solo.Also, don't play with me. I'm very cancerous.TL;DR: Are you cancer immune? If not, don't play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you can get past the initial learning curve and burden of knowledge the game puts on you, then DOTA2 can be extremely rewarding.As far as most MOBAs are concerned, this one has a good blend of strategy and relfexes that rewards those who can use both to their advantage. The gameplay is, as a result, solid, and every sessions provides new opportunities for fun and strategy.The UI is a little underpopulated, however, and doesn't explain much. learning how to do some of the functional things, like leaving a game that's safe to leave, or muting people, or reporting people, are not super intuitive: you have to dig. Furthermore, the options available, though very powerful and plentiful, are not explained super well. As a result, it's important to toy around with your settings a bit, which can be a hassle.As far as the F2P model goes, it's pretty fair: you can play the whole game without needing any of the micro transactions. The only thing they do is customize your aethetics, and happily not to an extreme extent. Because of this, the game has a really unified look despite all the different items your characters can wear. This might dissuade people from buying them, because some of the items are barely even visible.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone with a hankering for a challenge. The game is NOT easy, but it is worthwhile and a lot of fun once you get a hang of things. Veterans of the genre will find a lot to like.			",160,29,0,19,5,1,24

												Valve (Icefrog or whoever) made some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ patches before, but last update... I want to say ""fock you"" to all who made this 7.00 crap. Worst update ever. Interface now really makes me wish to be blind. New map is just a nonsence, and this new hero is just the product of sick developer's imagination. I totally refuse to belive that someone REALLY want me to play dota after this upda... Downgrade(from ""Down syndrome""). Why Valve desperatly wants to make dota more casual? They want new players? But what about me, for example? I really love dota! I played it when it was beta! Why bunch of future ♥♥♥♥♥♥s is more important than nowday's community? I just don't get it. Looks like Valve really don't gives a single ♥♥♥♥ about players.			",73,10,2,5,5,0,1

												Since almost 4 years it has been my favourite game. Pretty much every patch since 6.82 was pure gold and the game was close to perfect and then came 7.00.... seriously Valve f*** you for totally ruining my beloved dota2! I just cant wrap my head around it why you had to do that. The game looks more like LOL now and there are sooo many things broken. Absolutely unnecessary and an affront. It's just a big shame. Keep in mind that not every player is a pro or has the time to analyse all the meta changes and has fun doing so. For me you just ruined a perfectly good game and I don't think that's going to change any time soon.			",8,2,0,3,6,0,4

												This game is gonna die soon I guarantee.Map is totally changed and horrible now, why the ♥♥♥♥ are there tons of runes, highgrounds and shrines in jungle? Shrine is so broken it's actually ridiculous. Are they supposed to be like those little fountains that we have in Heroes of the Storm?They also added a new hero with an arcana skin(33$) that has a broken passive spell, but I think they are gonna nerf it after a lot of players spend their money on arcana just to spam the hero every single ranked match.Matchmaking is broken as ♥♥♥♥, why am I (5k mmr) getting matched with people who have 3.9k-4.3k? It's ridiculous.Fix the god damn matchmaking at least.			",12,1,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game that will quene you with people that have 40% of your Hours played. This game will show you the worst scum of the worst and will favor them in a Trial. This ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game will show you that in this Cyber world, there is a hell, and you are in it once you start palying rankeds. This game will take away your will to get better at it by throwing hords of Russians, Peruvians, ♥♥♥♥♥s and whatnot who speak only their Native language, but start playing a Ranked in which team Coordination and Communication are a MUST. This game will take away your hopes of a normal Match and it will leave you with a bad taste in your mounth once you lose a game by being the only one that did his job right and is not feeding. Overall i give this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game a 4/10, the game itself is worth at least a 9, but when you put Russians and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the entire world together without putting them in their own servers or restricting them by their gameplay, this is what you get, people that cannot communicate and play together to win. I promise you, this games community will make you loose all hope in Humanity and in everything that is good, if you´re unlucky, you will end up as one of them. I, for this matter, am abandoning this ship, after 1,3k hours played i finally figured, this game is being ♥♥♥♥ed by its own community because it fails to set up people who can communicate, i might come back and play it once valve makes people stay in their respective regions by creating dedicated servers ( Like LoL ) but untill then, i will no longer participate in this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thank you and good luck trying to make something out of this game, you will need it.(FYI, i´m pretty sure there are some typos and grammatical errors but i dont really bother checking them right now)Regards, Steve, a once diehard Fan of this game who was hoping Valve would do something about the Community but was dissapointed over and over again.

												Well balanced game. But in order to enjoy this game you should play with the team. Ranked games with random team members bring no fun. Too many idiots who don't know that team (not heroes) wins and they don't know how to play as the team. My first fall occured immediately after qualification. I felt from 2300 to 1200. Over 1 year I spent to raise my score up to 2200. Then I've started falling down (1500 at this moment). So I decided stop playing Dota 2. I wish you all good luck.			",1,0,0,0,0,0,2

												Really, Truly an amazing game. After putting so much time in this game I have realised that I finally had lost faith in the human race and decided to rip my balls off. Its a great game to learn foreign languages and such but not much else. Unless you are a tryhard I would not suggest this game as the community is rude as hell. Its pretty addictive as any other MOBA but by far not the best ive played. Even if the community is less racist then HON and more mature then the community of LOL, its pretty bad. The only way i am ever playing this game is with a group of friends.			",110,6,1,17,4,0,25

												How to describe this game... This is the first Valve game where I haven't had fun at playing it and made me question their work. After a year of gameplay I can easily say that if you don't play it with friends you can end up with a brain tumor or end up in a nuthouse. You need to play it with friends because it's the only way to enjoy the suffering.The artstyle and voices are great, but the gameplay can be a little tricky and it can go unbalanced very easily. The only time where I found the gameplay balanced was in the Greeviling because everyone was in the same level. But the gameplay it's not the biggest issue with this game.The community it's REALLY toxic and Valve itself suffered this recently. They are equal or worse than the CoD community.The only good thing about this game is the business model. The big difference between Dota 2 with TF2 and CS:GO it's that those games gives you fun and money. This game only gives you money.No matter if you win or you lose a match, you will always end up with the same bitter taste.I only recommend this game for those who lost their minds or just want to make a couple of bucks to buy another game.If you are sane, please make a restriction order to anyone who invite you to play it.

												A few things that stand out over my 4500+ games I’ve played are the following:1) Regardless of how supportive and accommodating you are, you will always be stuck with one cancerous player that will just ruin the game.2) Your opponents will always play like a well formed professional team. Your team on the other hand will fight over the mid position, pick 5 cores, purchase no wards ,fail to rotate on ganks and you won’t have a courier till the 35 minute mark.3) If you play with your friends they will slowly break all ties from you. This is because of the constant aggressive verbal directions and abuse you will hurdle at them over the course.4) Dota2 is like a drug addiction. You will be always chasing that first high. In reality it’s a flaming piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ You end up depressed, jobless and friendless.5) Now that I reflect on the total hours I’ve spent on this game, I could have done something useful in my life – Like get a University degree, or learn a new skillset.

Forget about school, get Dota and play with cold-blooded russians, which doesn't shrink back to insult you because you're not playing good with a hero, which is in their opinion, the easiest hero in the whole game. Well, the only thing is that you cannot understand them while they're talking ingame, because they're mainly talking russian.Get yourself a dictionary and start learning russian there!

												This is a good game..i mean its a amazing game. It requires strategies patience and strong teamwork to win a single battle, which is the reason i keep playing this game. ***But!!!***This game you have to play online which means it requires you to play with someone else. Its even more interesting; however, many players that I have to say that they are mentally retard and it TOTALLY destroy this game! Imagine what your feeling when u try hard carry this team and one of ur teammates intentionally feed the enemy just for a dumb reason? Or you try to rank up to get higher mmr but your teammates afk and stay at base? Sometime it even worse, they not only go feed themselves but feed your courier and wards. For ♥♥♥♥ sake I am really done on this! If Valve cannot fix the dumb players like I said, this game is zero fun to play and its completely waste your time.			",34,3,1,1,7,1,2

												update 3400 hours later im still playing this game. Hey update 7.00 is really good! Except for one thing they decided to put a disease into the game in the form of monkey king. 200% crit with a 2 second stun AND 1200 god damn range nice job OSfrog pogchamp. Oh wait there's more passive ability after 4 hits on a single hero gives 200 (??!?!??!) bonus damage and 50% lifesteal. Add the two together and you get everything dies at 8 minutes in one hit. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!! Let's give this melee hero an attack range of 9 billion because he has a cool staff. Kappa. We aren't even going to talk about his ultimate which gives him even MORE damage. Was excited for this hero had really cool and unique abilities like tree jumping and everything but then they decided that they wanted him to kill everyone and all their ancestors going back 68400 years with his Q. Nice. Other than that the update is great and fun but too bad every single game has monkey kappa in it because he's new and OP nice nice nice. Never been as salty by a hero as this before it actually made me pull a muscle because of how angry i was. nice. So in review, 7.00 gets a 8.6/10 but then monkey king is a solid -8.6/10 so there you go nice job OSfrog its now a 0.			",173,17,1,12,20,1,12

												The old loading screen used to let you voice chat, and peruvians are everywhere ruining everything.Love the game hate the lack of region lock.You want a solution to make your game not region locked but less rage inducing. Make the default language unset and english an option. Use people's locations to decide what server they play in by default so if I encounter a feeding peruvian who refuses to speak english on an english server there's actually a reason to report them.Don't throw your life away kid, you start playing and after you learn how you'll love it but it'll shave off at least three years from your life from anger related stress.

												Dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably won’t suit you if you’re looking to play casually. There’s a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, there’s a wild and exciting variety of play here that’s unmatched, even by its peers. It’s a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that it’s completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isn’t just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The innovative playstyle that i have been made new to allows for me to have free hand to generally cup my bawlz or hold my weinar, this breathtaking romance between my left hand and genitalia is phenominal towards the performance of my skills in dota , as well as this masterful technique i would reccomend this game. But you may ask yourself why isnt your left hand on the keyboard, as a connoisseur of stolen pc equipment i do not have the latest in razor technology or advanced moba gaming equipment therefore waisting a second hand on Dota			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't really enjoy competitive games, as a rule. I like the idea of them, but I don't play them. I have been playing a lot of Dota 2 though, because I don't think that Dota 2 is really a ""game."" I sometimes lose a game so badly that I wake, days later, in a cold sweat. At first, all I can think is that I am happy to have woken from the nightmare. Later, in a moment of creeping fear, I will realise that the real nightmare is how bad I am at Dota... and yet I cannot stop myself from playing it.Dota 2 is an endless nightmare from which I cannot wake. To install it is to introduce into your life a hellish netherworld, one in which close friends are so disappointed in one another that they cannot even express it. One in which improvement means only that you will be matched against better opposition...All of this horror floats on the constant threat of the ""low priority queue,"" a stygian hellscape that this review could never hope to describe. Summary: 10/10, would play again (until my sightless eyes drop from their sunken sockets and the cold grip of death frees my mortal husk from its trap).			",205,74,2,17,16,4,25

Here, after level 1.Yeah, yeah, I'll get the hate from expert players, but hey! How are you going to attract new players if you don't first solve smurfing problems? There are tons of ways to erradicate this problem but I think Valve is just trying to keep its market.Anyways.

												Game was good, got terribly broken... I quit, that's the long story short.Wan't a long story long? Well... read ahead then my dear no-lifer (says the one that spends time writing game reviews in Steam)!  So... where should I start? Of course... from the start! A friend of mine invited me to play this ""Super badass game"" with him and after days and weeks of pleads I finally bent to his will. Entered the game, all felt fine. He was a pro player and guided me through it. I am also a sharp person that never does anything if he's unprepared so I read a few tons of guides from DotA legends and watched plenty of tournament videos before my first game. I started high above all the newbies and my lerning curve was quite fluent. This means I rarely got to deal with raging idiots, though rarely is not the same as never. Even I that played at a higher level than my matches got raged at from time to time. Imagine how a normal player felt... brainless, super confident brats keep yelling at everyone they don't like (even if he is playing well) that he is terrible and should uninstall the game. Heck, the best guide ever writen for the game starts with a description on how to mute players and how to shield your psych... So yeah, nail number one in DotAs coffin:  The terrible playerbase.  Yeah, there are some nice guys that survived but their numbers are rapidly dwindling and honestly... even the kids at LoL are nicer these days! Well... DotA could have still sprung out of it's coffin if that was all... but it isn't. Things like the terribly broken matchamking system count as well. Even if you rock you can hardly progress through the ranks and as gamers say ""Leave the trench"". Since all depends on your partners and you mostly get raging kids and game-abandonig russians (no racism, simply plain facts and statistics, hell I'm a fan of Putin!), you will never be able to roll up enough wins to play with skilled people. Yeah... Valve says it's fair and it doesn't rank your wins/losses but your overall performance in the game... but... yeah, you guessed it, that's pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! The heroes... See, the game has this goat fella named Riky that is wrecking public games because of his easy-to playiness and he is overpowered as hell to any unexperienced player (yeah, good ones can counter the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of him with plenty of heroes). So... instead of getting this guy nerfed (reduce his stats) he is getting boosted with every update. Same goes for plenty of heroes which ruins the game. The balancing of heroes and skills is being lost gradually over time and lately, if you see a certain hero in a team on a pub game you know he will win (and yeah, only jerks pick such... but that's almost all the players you'll meet!). Other heroes that are so fragile and weak like the poor crystal maiden which gets killed 50 times per game are getting nerfed instead... And another nail goes in.I can keep this up for quite a bit but I realise readers are dropping off from the review like mosquitoes near ""Raid"" with every line I add so lets cut it here and shoot the word: The game is duying and unless it gets a restart it will keep degrading. Don't bother... you lose a lot of time playing it, matches take ages at times, no one pauses for you if your mom gets a blackout next to you... well either help her or lose the game... you see?  It's not a good game to play, you won't learn russian (apart from swears)... you wont get smarter (quite the opposite)... you wont make cash unless you sacrifice your whole life to play professionally. You pour so much nerves, time and effort in this game and you get nothing apart from a few and far between games where you actually match with good guys who pick normal heroes and don't spam the mic with swears.  Well the game isn't a♥♥♥♥♥♥as someone who is on a rage spree might claim... it's a decent one but it's not worth it: I would mark it as a 4.65/10 (yeah, indeed: 4.65... what a nice number) and advice you against playing it. That's all really, excuse my lenghtiness and if you actually read that... well, go reward yourself with a treat from the fridge!			",26,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I dont usually write reviews but this is a game that I played really much because I enjoy the genre and tried many games in it to compare DotA 2 with. Basically in tems of speed DotA 2, along with Strife (which is basically DotA 2 in graphics style of LoL with a pet+item system which you can level up by playing) is average, so if you think a MOBA should be slower you should try League of Legends and if you think it should be faster you should try Heroes of Newerth. If you are looking for an alternative that is less knowledge based you should probably try Heroes of the Storm, since you dont have to learn as many item effects.DotA 2 in a ""nutshell"" after ~2400h of playtime:-New players (if interested in cosmetic items) will have to visit the shop now because game drops have become so incredibly rare that it has become hilarious.-IF you buy item chests in the shop and dont get the set you bought it for, you can't sell the items since volvo put a trade+market cooldown (2 months I think) on every new item that gets released (yay!) so if you dont want to spend money until you have each possible drop from that single chest (RNG is strong in this one) you're better off waiting until the desired item is marketable and then buy it off the market.-Volvo greed simulator: The old loot system, in which you could acutally gain items after a game ,for DotA 2 profile levels, and a leveling chest you had in your inventory (which could be opened every few profile levels and contained a new chest to open later) was successfully reworked into greed-mode. The chances to get ANY items after a game are as low as getting a legendary (or higher) before. Sure they drop ENTIRE sets now, but most of them are common to rare, which overall is still less rewards than before if you add up singe items and put them up against the set drop chance now in both, item quantity AND value. Maybe you should try some ""never change a running system"" in this particular function.-Mostly developer/support abandoned game. the new content this game releases is mostly made by the community since the hero sets are workshop based and hero releases/patches are just really really rare. Special events are mostly the same every year and the report system is most likely 100% count-based/not reviewed by support employées (for example if you express your annoyance towards...lets say russians...for not being able to communicate in english on EU servers, you will most likely end up muted because out of the 10 players in a EU game 3 (probably more) are most likely russian and will report you for speaking english)-These days russian-infested to the max...8/10 games you play will result in eyecancer due to russian chatspam, even though they have their own servers(!) because its way cooler to go to international servers and spam your native language, thanks volvo for letting that happen! maybe one day the EU servers will be renamed into russia 2 and russia 3 and the actual EU will have to play on american servers after all :D*EDIT*-In addition to the listed issues, the game servers are now absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1/4-1/5 of the games crash and are not counted due to connection issues with the servers, great job of making it even worse when ppl thought that wasn't possible...Conclusion: If you want to play a game in which you get rewarded for playing (in terms of cosmetic effects and/or profile progression) this probably is not the right choice anymore, because as stated you don't get level rewards or similar stuff anymore, just REALLY rare item drops (probably in the 0,2% range). If you want to blow off some steam with trolling other players, spamming your native language while being sure nobody will be able to understand you this might probably be YOUR gamechoice #1. The community these days is mostly toxic and troll based so this is NOT your game for some serious gametime (at least not in solo matchmaking).I didnt check the other games these days but the community in HoN was much more friendly and less russian.In my personal opinion DotA 2 isn't playable solo anymore because there is too few games where you can actually play properly, without being annoyed by trolls or russians...Gameplay/Balance: 9/10Community: 2,5/10Rewards System: 1/10			",83,43,2,23,3,2,1

												Bad Rats does everything this does, and more. Don't be lured in by the F2P. It's out classed by classics like [John Romero's] Daikatana and Day One: Garry's Incident. These, Bad Rats, and more will offer you a far better experience than Dota. Even if you're a filthy casual I wouldn't recommend this game, you should go for Snuggle Truck if you are not up to date with the competitive scene for the aforementioned trio of games.

												Long time player of this game but the most recent update went a little too far. I commend Dota for always bringing something new and always expanding the heros, gameplay, map, etc. on a very regular basis, however, this most recent patch missed the mark.It feels too much like LOL now, which was the reason this game was such a success in my opinion. It didnt have that childlike feel gameplay and did not need to distract players with fancy huds and split screens, it was all about the game play first and foremost. I've played a few games since the update has been released and they just went too far too fast, the modifications to the map where necessary, but they went too far with the runes now on dire and radiant side of the river. The initial 30 seconds of the game were what also made Dota interesting. It would force team fights, even though the teams may not have even wanted to engage. This new method is too safe and breeds farmers in the game rather than team fights. Coupled with the new map, the new hud, new hero, new buffs and nerfs, all too much too fast in my opinion and will not be playing this game for awhile until it's been rebalanced. Thumbs down for now.			",41,1,0,2,0,0,4

												With over 1K hours of Dota the new patch just ruined the whole gameplay  Drastic changes were applied to the map and rune spawns don't have the intensity it had before where the opposing teams would compete for it. It would be harder for previous players to adapt to the new patch as it feels like a completely new game to play.Another drastic change that I have found out is that the 'talent tree' the new update has ruined the whole division of characters that were divided by 'Strength' 'Intelligence' and 'Agility'. I find that as a very cancerous tool for the hero to level up with This may be my opinion but the HUD skin that has been applied in the new patch has been ruined. With the HUD skin staying the same for almost three years, this update suddenly changed every single ♥♥♥♥ING thing in the game.The new hero that was released 'Monkey King' would have been a fine hero until drastic changes were applied into this sh***y update. This game has been downloaded by mostly long-term users and Valve has lost a lot of them.Don't download this game. I'm triggered af			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sadly....This time has come.... 10000 hours later accross smurfs etc.... and 7.00 hit like a sledgehammer. I love this game...I hate this game, it made me hate everything and yet i kept coming back for more.... Yes Monkey king is a little Broken, as all new heroes are....But this change is just more than i care to take with the time i sunk into this game. So the good- Still looking?The not so good- The new map, blows mostly, too much low ground- The UI is terrible (Too Small)- The hero name above the portrait is cheap and looks unfinished- The shop is terrible- Checking enemy items is terrible- The Skill tree is terrible, pick 3/4 cores and win game by default because lvl25=23, get midas and pick XP bonus. GG EZ. - The skills in the skill tree are terrible, let's give heroes free lifesteal, triple silence, triple sniper shot...Cool...but not what those heroes are to me.- Level 25 CM? With blink, drums, hex, and aghs 40 min game? NO PROBLEM- And since all heroes changes etc. are based around the above♥♥♥♥♥♥skill tree, that just means EVERYTHING is terrible.- Please rename game either STORM : Heroes of the League of Dota from Newerth.... OR Level 25 Rush Simulator.- The Arcade style VS thing....is just....nasty.- HEAPS more clowns than usual, Congrats your patch cleaned the bottom of the barrel- The Stats tab being gone and not being levelable is terrible.- Wanna know how much int your OD has vs enemy to calculate damage? Goodluck if you don't know the game and heroes inside out,,,,but we making it noob friendly don't worry.- The damage, MS and armour tab is just♥♥♥♥♥♥ - Let's add a backpack to make it less confusing, its worse than ever....I'd rather have it drop on the ground thanks.- The Pre Planning is nifty, but should be kept for captain's mode, i want to have fun, and not reason with 4 random idiots why not having a courier is a bad idea before the game even starts- This game no longer feels like dota....having played HON, HOTS and League, it feels like none of them, but like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child spawned of 4 way incest. THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN- The performance issues are terrible- The servers are somehow worse than ever- I feel let down having downloaded 6.6GB of this♥♥♥♥♥♥br>I have a old image on external which i will never update to keep the memory of the game you guys ruined. If your intent is to force people to play this mess, with no regards for year long fans, give us a mod so we can search for games of a version of our choosing. OR SOMEONE MAKE A MOD PLEASE.While i have friends that have found this to be great, some have complained that the above appears to be more noticeable when playing solo. Maybe with 4 Friends this can still be great given the right circumstance.I accept many will disagree with all of this, but reviews are what our perceptions are on said things, and this is just mine.

												I've had this game in my Steam Library since beta, and occasionally I'd give it a try to see if I could tap into some of the excitement that continued to elude me, for some reason.  62 hours later, on May 12, 2014 (today), after reading the first 10  headlines in the Dota 2 Steam ""forums"", I promptly uninstalled the game.I'm not one of those dudes who mistakes his opinion for fact, so I'll just say this game isn't for me.  Rude, unfriendly community coupled with an overtly pretentious, self-important theme and arbitrary, unnecessarily difficult online play (""laning""? ""ganking""? ""last-hitting?"" REALLY?) are unappealing to me.  I suppose the kids prefer the game this way because they feel like they've ""accomplished something"" when they win (as opposed to the rest of us who simply ""play video games"").  As an over-30-year-old gamer with kids of my own, perhaps I'm just too old for this.  Anyway, thumbs down.  NEXT.EDIT: my 9-year-old just found out ""Dota 2"" is a thing (thanks, loud-mouthed fourth graders.)  So +1 for ""Dota 2"" because it's one pc game my kids and I can play together and not worry about off-color game content (as long as we play with bots and not foul-mouthed angry nerds.) Looks like I *might* be re-installing....... SIGH.... As they say in Vegas, the House always wins. Well played, Valve, well played.			",114,20,0,7,5,1,5

												I have always loved Dota 2. It was the original and LoL copied it. Now, you have gone beneath your pride and identity to copy and submit to LoL. The game is ruined.

												I have to say that I'v always thought Dota as the best MOBA out there in terms of gameplay and the insanely high skill cap. A much of that remains now that 7.00 came out, but in the mean while the GUI is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to the point that the game doesn't feel right anymore.However, the issue isnt only the GUI. A major issue is the new map imo. Suddenly the map became a super open world that doesn't have the same boundries it used to have. Theres just way too many ways to invade opposing side of the map making the world feel like its an open arena instead of radiant and dire side.I have to say that my first impressions on the new patch is leaving me with the feeling that I don't wanna play dota2 anymore at all.Edit: 7th of Feb 2017After some UI fixes the game has started to look like Dota again. However, during these new updates things have gone in other ways a lot worse.After some changes to the match making system and report system, there has been a significant raise in unjustified low priority games. You can get low priority for anything now. Example: Muted after 3 games of summary showing 0-3. Didn't say a word during those games, won 1, lost 2. After which a 4 game winstreak (still muted) and receive 3 games in low priority.Problem is that opponents are able to report you. If you play certain heroes you will farm reports like theres no tomorrow. I kinda have to say, Im starting to feel im finally done with this game for good and won't put any more money into it.

Posted: December 9, 2011
2016:After 5 years of Dota 2, all the heroes are finally released and the next newest hero, Monkey King is coming out in December this year.Dota 2 has become a spectator sport in the footsteps of traditional sports such as Basketball and Football, in the sense that they are all team-oriented games and require strategy to win.  Through the recent gameplay patches of 6.87 and 6.88, there have been many new changes that focuses more on the strategic aspects of the game, namely Scans and cheaper more defensive items.New items such as Echo Sabre and Hurricane Pike also serve to make competitive games more exciting as teams that have fallen behind in the early game now have a chance to comeback with the cheaper mid-tier but very cost-efficient items giving them an opportunity to fight back.""Everything can work""As a whole, Dota 2 has become a game very much focused on positioning and the right draft composition of heroes for the game match at hand. No particular strategy has dominated the tournament scene this year, be it push, defensive splitpush, or teamfight, and it is this remarkable balance that allows many teams with varied style tendencies to showcase their way of playing without feeling disadvantaged. Be it EG's methodical lane dominance and calm style, MVP Phoenix's all-in teamfight style, EHOME's strategic drafting style, or TI6 Winners - Wings' anything goes style.Valve has also shown interest in further expanding the game through its released custom games feature for Dota 2 and Virtual Reality support for spectating. Overall, its been a good year for Dota 2, the game is more fun than ever with any strategy being workable, all heroes being viable in competitive tournaments and more expanded options for spectating, viewing games and analysing replays and statistics that aficionados would love.2015:Over the course of a year, Dota 2 has slowly introduced its Source 2 game client, which allows for easier integration of custom games similar to the original system of Warcraft 3's Battle.net. The International 2015 tournament is also a huge success and has a record $18.4 million, of which $16.8 million were contributed by community spending. Valve has also revealed its future plans for the game in the form of quarterly Majors tournaments that is meant to further develop its competitive scene and community interest.It is also clear that Dota 2 will be taking a seasonal games events approach towards stimulating community support, with obvious targets being December Holidays, Chinese New Year and Halloween. With regards to porting over Dota 1's legacy, there are only 2 heroes left: Arc Warden and Pitlord; and they are likely to be introduced with the aforementioned games events.At this point, the longevity of Dota 2 is very much secured in the foreseeable future due to Valve's Steam Client storefront, massive player base and successful implementation of cosmetic item sales that do not affect gameplay.Icefrog, you did the right thing by choosing to work with Valve for Dota 2's future back in 2010. I hope that you continue to work on your legacy and enjoy the feelings of joy, happiness, rage, sadness and comradery that you have brought to millions of people worldwide.2014:Dota 2 just keeps improving over time. At the rate this game is progressing, it is likely that it will still be around 5-10 years later. The community keeps expanding and the content updates are constant and full of exciting new features. Seasonal events bring about new quests and co-op gameplay that make good use of the core game's heroes' abilities. The cosmetic items economy is healthy and ever booming with more and more workshop artists contributing. As a competitive game oriented towards esports, Dota 2's professional scene has certainly expanded exponentially and The International's prizepool over the years can be seen as an indicator. It has grown exponentially from $1.6 million in 2012, to $2.9 million in 2013 and is projected to hit $10 million in 2014.Dota 2 has also recently implemented Ranked Matchmaking, which allows players the opportunity to play games for an ELO-style rating. While it has exploits and flaws at its debut, the subsequent updates over time have vastly improved the experience. It is a welcome new feature and it enables players interested in a more competitive experience to play to their best abilities, knowing that their teammates and opponents will likely put in the same amount of effort.2013:Valve Inc. has proven that they will continue to support Dota 2 in all aspects and maintain a healthy esports scene. The game caters to all spectrums of players, be it casual, competitive or spectator.Matchmaking system still has its design flaws and the game still lacks a way to convey to competitive players their skill level and standings/ratings.2012:Dota 2 requires huge player investment, but provides magnificent and immeasurable rewards for commitment.http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/08/21/dota-2-pt1/Now free to play! All heroes are free and available. Items are available for purchase for each individual hero, they do not affect the game balance at all as they are purely cosmetic, and the colors and items fit Dota 2's medieval setting.2011:This is a game for the competitive PC gamers. DOTA 2, the sequel to DotA features better character animations, mechanics, graphics and interface design. The ease of matchmaking, connecting with your friends and playing a cooperative team game all culminate together to make DOTA 2 a complete game experience. No two games are the same and despite this game still being in beta, it is already a great experience akin to other AAA PC games out there. This game is a definite buy for me. What will it be for you?			",60,12,0,0,3,0,6

												When I first started DOTA2 I was a little overwhelmed, as my first ARTS / MOBA game it was pretty complicated. I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. Before I knew it, I was performing better and better. I stopped making silly mistakes and I got vastly better at not feeding the enemy team. For the most part, everyone I've met was very helpful and nice, there have sometimes the jerk however. As I continue to play DOTA2 more and more, I'm sure I'll continue to improve. I recommend this game for all :)Yes i used Google Translate, you can kill me now.			",1,0,0,1,0,0,0

												I HAVE YEARS OF DOTA1I'm sure you've played Warcraft 3, and there's a big chance you played the map DoTA Allstars (defense of the Ancients //aka  DOTA 1 )    Remember how hard it was to reach all those Keys for spells all over the keyboard for each hero ? well think of it no more, because Dota 2 has the SAME spell keys for all heroes (QWERT), no more scripts/software needed for that.   I would say Dota1 was a succes for ICE_FROG , but with dota2 i think he hit the jackpot.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I HAVE YEARS OF DOTA 2after some time. Would like to add the things u might not like about the game, it can be rly fustrating for an old dota player like me as i have decent knowledge about heroes/items/mecanics/tactics.(been playing since dota1 had like no icons for items in shop)  from my understanding the machmaker works like this u win u get ~+25mmr ,for defeat you get -25, well this seems normal but........ some ppl make new accounts to troll or get a better start in mmr...       Sometimes enemy team can have a party , and your team will have none... Some ppl say u actually get worse players in your team if u win too much.... like i used to play with people in party at 3000mmr and i still do. but if u play alone..... well i droped from 3000 to 1500... BECAUSE people don't communicate.. because random ppl will feed either by buying couriers and sending them do die to the enemy, or they don't let u finish your item and kill the courier, or feeding with the hero (sending his hero to the enemy to be killed, enemy gets gold makes more items...you lose)  VALVE will do nothing about feeders, today i see a guy who was obviously muted for doing something bad in the past playing in RANKED LADDER, he started to buy couriers and feed the enemy...also was moving the courier so i won't finish my item. u can report, but they can always play again after few games in low priority... u can block them but the matchmaker could still place them in your team in next game.Valve dosn't care about you.. valve doesn't care.  u can't send replay to anyone.. it's chaos.. my advice don't even bother playing alone.

												Dota 2, a very frustrating game that forces you to play with and against other players. You'll rely on your team to preform their selected roles, and then watch in horror as they completely ignore the game mechanics and just chase down kills, rarely successfully. You build in game items during the match to enhance your characters role and then hope and pray your team doesn't feed the opposition too much. Team fights, normally 5v5,  tend not to happen as you watch your fellow team members run to meet their fate and be a hero. Sadly this ends up throwing the game and you lose. I would still recommend this game, purely for those few matches when the your whole teams synergy is in harmony, watch as the gold floods in, heroes get trampled, the towers crumble and the opposition blame each other for their loss.

That was the time when there were no cosmetic items and no ranked matchmaking. People back then only focus on enjoying (and testing) the game. Now, because of this ranked MMR, everyone's picking carries, thinking we can win the game with four hard carries. I've given up.			",100,15,1,12,9,1,8

												A message to my fellow conservatives: all is lost. A message to my fellow classical economists: we're all Keynesians now. With the release of How to Train your Dragon 2 (which might've been more suitably named ""How to be a Dictator 2""), Communist influence has been seeded into the minds of the children, destroying the potential for a perfect laissez faire economy for future generations. How to Train your Dragon 2 is a story of a young Shaggy Rogers discovering the wonders of ""Sandwiches"" for the first time with the Rottweiler he owned before Scooby. Our protagonist, a rebellious socialist who never came to grasp the true meaning of Republican Motherhood, is a frequenter of the parks, motivating the homeless by promising them peace and beating them until they promise to get a job or preaching to the innocent picnickers about the evils of animal cruelty. A subtheme of gun control is dished out discreetly as the script writers encourage us to do better than what game theorists think we are capable of with flawed moral consciences. In the same way viewers are assured that we have learned from the days of the arms race by subtly bringing up the Marilyn Monroe-JFK scandal. Obnoxious and unorginal, the production draws content heavily from the movies E.T. and Avatar, indicating that it could have been funded by a collective effort between PETA, James Cameron, the public health institute, Heidi Fleiss, and Joseph Stalin. In the end, the main character's tyrannical liberal-minded father boards a boat to Russia under heavy artillery fire by social darwinists, portrayed as defiant and unruly teenagers that want nothing but an end to civilization. I can say with certainty that any child who watches this film WILL become a democrat at some point in their lives, and, like the movie suggests, the only way to prevent the disease from spreading is to contain it.Oh and Dota 2 is a pretty good game too.

												Dear developers,I really loved playing DOTA2 until you guys ruined it with the new update. I've invested money to make my heroes look nice but now, I cant enjoy that because of the new patch, Would it be possible to revert back to the old patch but still have the new hero? I know Monkey King came from HoN because I've played him before there. Also, as for the shop items, it would be nice to revert back to the old one too. The old patch is a representation of DOTA2's uniqueness. The new design in my opinion, is trying to emulate LoL or HoN. Please bring back DOTA2's uniqueness. ",2,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being an old League of Legends player I really needed some time off LoL since I knew every champion, every item and every possible outcome for hero duels, I came to Dota 2. If you are just like me then I would strongly suggest taking a look at dota 2. It is much more realistic and I can guarantee it once you get to know a little bit the mechanics of the game and if you play it with a friend or two then you will have so much fun. No bugs whatsoever, very fluid game and most of all very diverse range of heroes. The only bad thing there might be (from what I have seen) is that there is quite a big number of trolls in the game.			",67,3,1,14,26,1,20

												Such a FANTASTIC MOBA. You will love every minute of the complex, well made mechanics that you can tell took people a long time to create and put love into. Definatly not pay to win. The reason why I said you SHOULDNT play this game is because of the Community. Everyone is a jerk. Lower ranking games consist of horrible people who have no idea what they are doing, so they blame everyone els on the team. THIS IS ALMOST EVERY GAME. These people make it INCREDIBLY hard to move up or learn from your mistakes because the one guy who has a lot of kills but doesnt help the team in any way is yelling at you. Its just amazing how horrible people are at this game, but are quick to judge. My suggestion is to SKIP this game  because what ever time, place or day you decide to get on to play this BEAUTIFUL game there will be someone who will put you in a bad mood. The only valid way to play this game is to have a group of friends to play with you. If you are missing even one person you will get someone who doesnt want to help you or the team. Again a FANTASTIC MOBA, it is just littered with its community.			",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A true masterpiece and a milestone in gaming, this sequel to a genre-definer that is now just bursting in a global scale is a great point of reference to anyone attempting to make a game of this genre. Great graphics, amazing sound and voice design, and rich backstories in every corner are just some of the features that make Dota 2 great. But it's major strong point is the depth in its mechanics.While Dota 2's gameplay might seem daunting at first, it's one of the best and more engaging ever seen in a game, and learning it is just one of the reasons why this game is addicting. Other games such as League of Legends end up falling short because their devs decided to cut much from the original formula, but Dota 2 kept it intact, and makes sure you learn something new everyday.Not only the core game is strong, but also the eSport scene surrounding it is amazing and growing, with several tournaments going on, including Valve's own The International. At the time of release, the game looks like a train with no brakes, about to crash against its competitors and run them over, raising the bar on the genre with a myriad of awesome features that perfectly compliment an awesome game.

I recommend this game for everyone who is looking to waste his time insted of doing something more useful even if it was only staring at the screen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More Russian than Moscow! 10/10DotA2 is a Russian simulator, explore the every day life of a Russian glued behind his computer screen wondering why these English capitalist dogs do not speak the almighty language of justice. Enjoy not being able to understand your teammates and swearing at eachother in a variety of Spanish/French (very rarely English) and most of all: Russian. You can play on the Europe West servers (with Russians), American servers (with Russians) or if you're missing out on that full Russian experience, play on the Russian servers. No wonder Ukraine is not taken yet, they're all too busy ''playing'' this game.Feel free to enjoy Solo Queue and end up with a group of 3 Russians and a Spanish 13 year old repeatedly, listening to a repeated soliloquy of backwards letters you've only seen once in a Chernobyl documentary. Attempt Duo Queue and end up with 3 Russians, which kind of diminishes the full blown Russian experience; thus I do not recommend you try this or you can play with bots, which are surprisingly better teammates than the Russians. Just for good measure I'll throw in an extra ''Russians'' to get the point across. Enjoy yourself, comrad.For those of you that do not enjoy the full Russian gaming experience, there is always CS:GO, which is the softcore version of DotA2. Disclaimer: Long exposure to DotA2 might cause capitalist ideals to give way to communism.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm Brazilian, but I don't like this country... so, sometimes I dream that I'm Nature's Prophet, and I teleport to the jungle, and... *snif, snif*, why they ganked me? Why Crystal Maiden didn't warded?! She hates me?!I guess I used to much the Mask of Madness...			",12,0,0,2,1,0,1

												Well, I depend on reviews of any game and haven't really tried to write one. But this 7.00 update forced me to write one. You see being a veteran Dota 2 player clocking 4.5k hours, I've been playing since it was on  beta. Many good updates, many bad ones too but we get along as same happened before with Dota upgraded to Source 2. But If I have only one word to explain current version of the game, it's trash. You know what I mean, taking time to write this review especially just to tell others how trash Dota 2 have become. 1. HUD is what killed the game. A super mini HUD made just to make your eyes weak. You can't even concentrate on the game if you need to check your stats. 2. Talent Tree. This very thing ruined games, how we used to plan and play making some heroes wreck. I don't know why valve thought of introducing this.3. Poor shop UI. I used to love how well informative shop menu was but now all I have to do is type every item to purchase it instead of directly going to that item and purchasing it.THANK YOU VALVE FOR RUINING DOTA 2.

												Like almost any other MOBA out there, it's ""free"" unless you want any of your looks customized.I only played a handful of matches, and being at least semi-literate in both MOBA UIs and old custom Warcraft and Starcraft maps, I can in no way recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore of MOBA fans. The UI is unintuitive, the shop is a mess to look at if you're new, and you will likely get your face smashed in by even the computer-controlled players time and time again while you punishingly learn every little thing it takes to be good at this game.If you have never played a MOBA, if you don't have a friend who already plays this and can walk you through what to do, do NOT try this game.If you really love MOBAs and are looking for a new one, yes, definitely try this and I hope you enjoy it. I did not, not even remotely.			",93,22,0,26,3,1,23

												This is a very good game!All players are very friendly with me and also with my mom (I often get asked about what she does and how she is).In this game you will find people all over the world (95% Russia and 5% the rest).People always wait to pick until they can decide a good synergy with their team and then they say one of the following quotes: ""fu.ck you bit.ch I'm going mid! I fuc.ked your mother last night""/ ""I will pick carry even if you did it first FU CANCER OMFG SON OF BIT.CH PIECE OF SH.IT!""/ ""CANCER TO YOUR FAMILY SUKA I GO MID""/ ""I PLAY WHAT I WANT I GIVE YOU DIC.K STFU OMFG NOOB REPORT THIS TRASH"" etc.This game aim for communication and team play so every player go YOLO, die alone and then ask for team and tell on all chat about how stupid they and how he played like a god (in almost all the situations the score of this person is 0-10+).Almost forgot: very important! Even if you lose or win type ""gg wp ez"". If you lose remember to always say that your team was full of noobs and you could win but not with such bad fu.cktards on your side. Ohhh, also say that enemy team have only noobs in ther composition.This game will teach you how much important is to listen to others and how to play as one. Then you get pretty much screwed cause those are just in theory and in practice all go yolo and fu.ck each other at the most brutal virtual level. Glory to mother Russia! May Putin guide your way!

												Dota 2 is a 5-v-5 MOBA game. You have a selection out of 108 unique heroes, each with a unique skillset. Every hero is also available from the minute you start. No playing X amount of games before this hero becomes available.The object of Dota 2 is to destroy the other teams’ Ancient. To do this, you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes (Top, Mid or Bottom) by destroying the outer towers. You’ll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps. As the game progresses, you’ll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team.Because of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members, communication is a very important aspect of the game. I therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that you’ll be teamed up with won’t always show the same willingness to communicate. If you’re just starting out playing Dota 2, I also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep, especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself. The skill ceiling is also extremely high. So every time you play, you might learn something new. Due to the high number of available heroes, skills and items, you can be sure that every game is unique.Something to be wary of is the community. There are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might. Most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action. Flaming is something that could happen often. But if you’re playing with a team entirely made up of your friends, this shouldn’t prove to be an issue. If this is not the case, don’t worry. You can always mute the players that are causing you grief and continue enjoying this wonderful, team oriented game.			",219,60,4,32,15,2,21

												Having upwards of 2500 hours on this game I used to love it. It used to be great until 7.00, the devs making the game feel like a copy of 'Heroes of the Storm' and 'League of Legends' instead of being its own game and differentiating itselfs from the rest considering it was the original game that started this genre. They are just throwing in different♥♥♥♥♥♥hoping for the best and if it doesn't? They don't balance it for ages until they make something else stupidly powerful. This game will also have you annoyed with your teammates either due to their toxicity or for there absence of common sense. The only communication you will see is from toxic players rarely will you find a good team with mics especially if you are queuing for solo ranked. And if you do happen to find that great team of people and what to play with them? You can only go for party mmr which no one cares about. The games mostly take from 25-45 minutes, and are often very one sided and the games that are evenly balanced can often for over 60+ minutes. And despite the page saying DotA 2 has a mostly positive reviews it is sad to see it is filled with one sentenced reasoning, leading new comers to believe the community believe it to be a goood game, seeing as many of the older community members are leaving the game prefering to play other games due to their annoyance with the recent patches			",27,0,0,1,0,0,8

												I can't really write a good review for the ever-changing landscape that is Dota2. But I will say the following generic things:Dota2 is not a simple team game. There are a huge amount of advanced techniques that you will have to be told or lookup online. You come into Dota to have fun with ""tools"", every character is a different tool. They move different, they turn different, they attack differently. If you enjoy playing the same game over and over and perfecting little, small tricks to give yourself a slight advatange, then this is for you. If you come from any fighting game for example, you can get into this. Like really into this.What makes Dota2 different from other MOBAs? Depth. Dota offers much more variety, much more freedom to experiment. Other MOBAs shy away from the huge complexity that is giving more tools to the tools. You have items that give you more movement options, that take away movement options from the opponent, even random modifiers that spawn on the map periodically. In other games you will find these ""options"" baked into a character, they try to guide you into learning how a character ""should"" be played. Dota2 gives you the sandbox to experiment, As a reminder, it's never anyone's fault when you fail to build your tool properly. This is a game. Have fun.Most people just look up to a player and copy his playstyle, and Valve facilitates this. But you don't have to. Everything depends in Dota2. Should you try Dota2? Yes. But remember to have fun. You will be playing a game that can last 1 hour per match. Enjoy. Smile. A lot of people forget this. If you're not enjoying Dota2. Uninstall.			",251,39,4,24,10,0,23

""sooka ♥♥♥♥♥ noob report"" - your average friendly Russians""Well played!""  - chat bind used in a mocking way""DROP YOUR STICK""- EternaLEnVy leading his team in a professional wayDota 2 is the leading game of the MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) genre developed by Valve Software, released in 2011. In Dota 2, players in teams of five control various heroes and abilities in a bid to utterly crush the enemy in a pointless waste of 30-60 minutes.* GameplayDota 2 largely follows the experience of the original Dota All Stars mod: you pick a hero of your choice and get assigned to the Radiant or Dire (formerly known as Sentinel and Scourge) faction with the objective of destroying the enemy's Ancient. Protecting the Ancients is maintained by towers and barracks which ensure lane equilibrium and creep strength. Heroes are initially very weak and must rely on creeps (faceless grunts) to obtain starting gold from which options to start pushing begin, as well as experience which enables leveling up abilities. Abilities range from:   Deal damage (and maybe a status effect)  Inflict a positive or negative buff  Area of effect damage/positive or negative buff  Utilities  Global effects While laning is the main way to gain gold and experience, alternate choices are fighting neutral creeps in the jungle (usually done by very specific heroes) or challenging the mighty Roshan, who drops the fabled Aegis of the Immortal (resurrect on death). In order to maintain the advantage, certain nuances of the game must be learned:  Last hitting/denying (ensuring/denying gold and experience)  Camp stacking (having a single jungle camp hold more creeps than intended)  Creep pull (having allied and neutral creeps fight each other to shift lane equilibrium)  Map vision (prevents ambushes)Of course, having a good Dota 2 experience is defined by your teammates, who may be either incompetent or singlehandedly taking on the entire enemy team and winning. Communication and teamwork are vital, thus it is recommended to play with friends, although it doesn't ensure victory.* Hero roles and balanceEach hero has a set of 4 abilities that have synergy with each other or other heroes' abilities, but more importantly, each has a specific role:  Carry/hard carry - heroes that need a lot of gold and levels to get the ball rolling  Support/hard support - heroes that excel at supporting carries in early stage, and usually   buy support items and stack camps   Jungler - heroes that spend early game in jungle, then ambushing lanes at level 6A hero is not forced to follow a role, although using highly unorthodox tactics will most likely earn you the scorn of your team, possibly giving you a trip to the low priority queue, filled with Russians and similar  friendly  people. Dota 2 often changes with large updates that give heroes buffs or nerfs, change certain mechanics or simply iron out bugs and glitches. The most popular heroes tend to be the ones that have an easy way of dominating games, making you have a hard time if they aren't on your team, although learning to counter them is a great learning experience.* Other interests in Dota 2If you get bored (and you will) of right clicking at the time, the game offers the option of following various e-sport leagues, the biggest being the yearly International hosted by Valve, and famous players (such as Dendi, EternaLEnVy and so on) which set many gameplay trends and strategies. There is also the large economy which is mostly based on altering the looks of heroes and the game, but with no pay-to-win options, except maybe gaudy gold cosmetics. Finally, every Chinese New Year/Halloween/Christmas a slightly different game mode is introduced, thus making the game slightly less stale.* Closing commentsDota 2 is a fairly well made game which offers many hours of play, although the relatively unchanging experience and hostile people may spoil your enjoyment. Personally, I wouldn't suggest getting too involved as you will become highly misanthropic, although I wouldn't say it is a bad game.			",27,9,1,4,3,2,14

There should be a choice to reject the NEW HUD and play with the old version. I am sure that the old one can still function even with the new hero specific feature that was added.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With over 110 heroes to choose from, Dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of all the games available on Steam.  Many players find that even after 100+ hours of gameplay, they feel incompetent at the game.  While this is probably Dota 2's greatest downfall, it is also the aspect that makes the game as great as it is.  There is just so much to learn in this game, that it will provide fans with countless hours of playtime.Verdict: Dota 2 is an extremely difficult game, and that is what makes it most rewarding.  Yes, the amount of time it will take a new player to become even an ""average"" player may take well over 100 hours.  However, if you are can overcome its steep learning curve and are looking for a game long term, DOTA 2 may just be the best game you can currently find - and it is free.			",166,34,3,11,13,1,36

												In general a great game, vested lots of time into it.Really liked it before patch 7.00.But at the moment I don't recommend this game.Ranked matchmaking is broken.In literally every game you play against smurfs (higher level players who level up ranking scores for money) or you are matched against unfair team stacks.It's grinding only, with some rare luck you get a good team and a win.Waste of time and money (if you bought ingame items).

												---------------------------------------------------Dota 2---------------------------------------------------Dota 2 is a wonderful game for teamplay, if you love games like destroying the enemy base and five heroes vs five heroes you would definitely love this game. The game works like this ,that there are two teams, first team is called ""Radiant"", second team is called ""Dire"" and each team will have a base, that base is called ""Ancient"", then to win this game you have to destroy there base. So basically the first one to destroy the enemy's ancient wins, but before that you must go through the enemy's towers, there's three tower on each lane, so you can't destroy their ancient if you don't destroy the three towers and you cant advance to the second tower or third tower, you must destroy the first, second and third then finally their ancient. Last thing is , each team will have five players so you and your teammate must cooperate if not you guys will lose instantly the game, then each player will have a to pick a their role. There are 10 roles. After you guys pick a roles. There will be three lanes there's ""Mid"", ""Top"", and ""Bottom"". So it can be like this 1 in the mid, 2 at the top and 2 at the bottom.10 Roles Carry - will bring victory if he levels up faster and makes gold faster.Support - will provide wards and courier, also will upgrade the courier.Lane Support - useful even without farm and can go to other lanes to help othersInitiator - will start the teamfight.Jungle - can get gold in the jungle so the other teammate can solo top/bottom.Pusher - can push faster through first, second and third tower.Escape - can bait the enemy or bring the enemy to your trap. Disabler - will stun the enemy or cancel the enemy's spell cast.Durable - will tank(shield) the teamfight so he's teammates wont die fast.Nuker - will bring massive damage too the enemy.This the common role in game, if you have this team you have 50/50 chance of winningPlayer 1Carrythis role will kill all the enemys and finish the gamePlayer 2Supportthis role will help the carry to farm because the other team will try to kill your carryPlayer 3Durablethis role will help in the teamfight, he will take all the damage of the enemy so the carry will livePlayer 4Initiatorthis role will start the teamfight so you guys will have an advantage of the enemyPlayer 5Disablerthis role will stun the enemy so the enemy can't cast spell or attackI hope you like it and I really recommend this game, so good luck and had fun :)Pls like my review Originally posted by author: Steven Baes A.K.A.

												Have an urge to review this game with its latest situation.We had a down time during Christmas time... and lately it seems that the player(s) were more frustating than before (closed beta, invite-only period). Also the leavers and the disconnected players are more rampant now. Which make this game more and more unenjoyable now. Noob-calling, negative not-team-players and the blame games involved, yes those kind that you have to expect when playing with total strangers. You'll be wasting 30-45 or even 60+ minutes of your life, thanks to them, losing easily. So this time around, you have to prepare yourself mentally to face those kinds. :DGood thing is that they have implemented the local lobby feature, so that you can actually play locally within your LAN. Should be a very good game worthy of having a LAN party again.I like the balance changes they put into the game, the item changes and things that make the early games more ""fun"", but...I'm putting this as a ""No"" for those who play only with a friend or two. You better play this with a full five-person-team to fully enjoy this game and the time not wasted. Or perhaps due to its current state, players similar to me might not have the reason(s) on how to fully enjoy this game. Hope Valve and the team can continue to improve on this game more.

												An extremely fun Strategy game that involves teamwork, brainpower,co-ordination, the quick reaction of the gamer and a powerful computer. :D In this game, every millisecond counts and teamwork and co-ordination is the most important. Not to mention a powerful computer :D This game can be very nerve wrecking at times and also fun! The wide range of heroes and combinations of heroes /items also makes this game unique for different gamers! Highly Recommended!9.5/10-WinterApple			",41,7,0,4,11,1,6

												Dota 2 is a very addictive game but since 7.00 the new update released the game in my opinion has dropped alot the game is basically broken with alot of stupid builds with the new skill tree making some heros way to broken and some just stupidly bad they are not even worth playing anymore and the HUD has ruined the game for me i can play 2 games and then feel sick because of the HUD making it very hard for me to play the changes to the shop has made it harder to buy items and i just personally hate the way the they never considered the HUD Effects that alot of players have spent money on to get and now with the new update the HUD Effects are basically worthless and hardly change anything the new hero monkey kind is cool and all but with all the other changes like the broken skill tree with some heros and the HUD changes i find this game extreamly less enjoyable			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't bother spending hundreds on other language learning programs, or ones that claim to be the best, like Rosetta Stone. DotA 2 has the market cornered and you would have to be a fool to pay anything for these ""superior"" pieces of software when DotA 2 is completely free of charge! When you want to learn a new language, simply queue for your region, and select the language that you already know. Valve's patented system will immediately match you with other language speakers who will get you on the fast track to success! You will love your learning experience. I can guarantee that you will not grow to hate other cultures due to a language barrier, because soon you will be able to speak Portugeuse, Spanish, Russian, and Chinese!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a purgatory simulator based on the existential novel No Exit, in which you are trapped in a game with 9 other people who hate you. You spend your time killing the same enemies, who spawn every 30 seconds for all eternity, until you have amassed an arbitrary amount of gold/items with which you kill the other team. The worst 2 players in the game are blamed for every mistake made and ridiculed without mercy, while the player with the highest kill/death ratio (often times not the best player) calls you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for the 60 minute duration. It's a nice game and I highly recommend it.			",1261,387,51,165,182,10,255

												I used to play this game with kind of delight. But it was a long time ago when everything started. You know- you came from school to play some good games, start picking and ... OH MY GOOOD! There are no supports and whole your team is speaking some kind of magic language, that you can heard only in fairytales. Yea I am talking about azbuka. And you know, doesen't matter if you checked before finding the game that you wanna play with english speaking people, oh no! It really doesen't matter if you checked EU or NA region, or no... They are everywhere you watch, even in your bed. There is aboslutelly no hope to get anything normall from them. You can just enjoy their mighty ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; words or glorious ""♥♥♥♥♥"" words for whole game long in your chat. Theese gyus are so good that thay can stay whole game in you base, just sitting their♥♥♥♥♥and spamming voice chat with that two words. Eventually if you are playing solo and they come as four or three stack, you can next game enjoy your low prio or mute, because of nice reports they made. And yea, I almost forgot about MatchMaking- you can just hope that you will not play with someone who has plyed 4000 hours when you have played like 90 hours. MM here is kind a surprise what you get. But remember you will never play against someone who has 10 hours when you have 1000 not really. Thats the power of good matchmaking, or not?			",11,3,1,1,0,1,5

												Haven't enjoyed 7.00 at all.Playing a support feels terrible now with the changes to visibility and the maze of trees/stairs everywhere, trying to ward is just a nightmare.It feels like as soon as one team starts getting ahead it just snowballs with the new talent system.Before 7.00 Dota was the only game I played but can't see myself continuing, it's basically a completely different game.

												This is a MOBA game, what else could I say about it?I'm pretty sure you've read a bunch of reviews upon dota before coming to this review. Getting straight to the point that this game is probably worth playing if you're interested in facing individuals across the internet, with the probability of being skilled in tactics and strategy. These strategies and tactics are accomplished via the vast cast of characters within dota, each with their own set of abilities, roles (most characters are not confined to their specificed roles), and given a wide variety of items that can produce a devastating or riduculous combination that will cripple the enemy team.If you're up to play this game, let it be discerned that how you interact with your teammates is vital in your aim to win the match against the opposing team. An example of what I mean would be communication: within this game, you will not always be paired with individuals that you will be on equal footing with each other, but you and that other person will have to compromise to make of what you can to achieve the same goal. In addition, aside how you communicate with another, you could gain ideas of how to play a certain character, plot ingenius tactics, and enjoy the sensation of teamwork.Leaving off on one final note: Remember that every loss within dota, show be a gain via reflection. See what has been done wrong or hasn't been done at all with your comrades, and together offer strategies and suggestions for future matches. Do not let the loss of a match get to your head; always remain composed, and level headed.			",74,9,0,6,7,1,6

Review:It the only strategy that I like.Dota 2, it's very good game with not bad community..  Really, i see very smallest number of idiots in the game..At this moment the Dota 2 game more comfortable and welcome for new players..Advantages:1. Atmosphere - Very good atmosphere of team play. The epic battles with the friends are AWESOME!2. Too many characters - Dota 2 have too many characters (more 100+). Always interesting to learn new character and start to destroy enemy's faces.. 3. Always updates - IceFrog do not sleeping, everyday valve publics new updates for the game. Bug fixes, new items, characters and etc.4. Very good effects - When proceed a fight with enemy team. Effects looks AWESOME!5. Good punishment for leavers/feeders and etc.  - Low Priority, the most progressed system for sorting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ players..6. Fast loading. [THANKS 7.00]Disadvantages:1. Balance - Yes, everyday we see updates. But some characters have unreal unbalance! For explame: Phantom Assasin have creets.. If you're lucker you will kill ALL who can move..2. Community - Some players love to losing the games. And everyone understand it..3. Compendium - Together we hates the players called as ""QUESTERS"". For explame: ""Guys wait a minute, i need to kill more neutrual creeps..""4. Items for a characters - Too many items which do not correspond to the character's stories. (Like Ursa with Balalaika, Vodka and etc.)5. Bugs - Yes, i know all games have a bugs. But Dota 2 have some bugs, which do not fixing. (Like Losing connection of the server after pickup the character...) [7.00 FIXED.]On other game looks good! But you have to rate it by himself!			",239,39,6,20,20,0,22

												I feel my life slip away, fleeting with every hour I play. I can't stop, it is too much. When was the last time I saw the sun? I cannot remember, likley years ago. It's a trap, sucks you in and won't let go. I can't rightly remember what my life was like before Dota, its a faint a vauge blur. I seem to remember human interaction, friends, happiness... It was so long ago now, yet I yearn to go back. Sadly, there is no going back, not now. I'm in too deep, I've strayed too far, down the path to Dota I go. What matters now? No, it is not joy, though I wish it was. No, no, no, what matters now is MMR, a seemingly meaningless number with a grasp tighter than any drug. My life is in shambles, I wish to escape, it is encompassing me, it has consu-Oh hey, ""Match is Ready""!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 24, I have never touched a cigarette.

Most likely I will make billions, as Kristen Stewart is already on the project, so are many other famous actors (Mark Wahlberg, Channing Tatum and so on). I would recommend this game, as even if a part of you dies.... New part is always being born! Sometimes new part might require a straight jacket. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I may not have played as much as the veteran players, but even I can tell this 7.00 update is horrible. Valve- ""Hmm...maybe we should make the UI tiny and make it so that people have to take their eyes off the game for 20 sec. just to find their stats, then let's make them spend more time on trying to find an item in the new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ store we're gonna make. Oh! And one more thing we're gonna ruin! Let's add this talent tree that makes some heros get 35 sec off thier death timers, or give them OP upgrades at lvls 10, 15, 20, and 25! People are going to love this update!"" Yeah Valve, I'm not sure if you're just not reading the reviews, or if you just don't care. But if you are reading them, you know where I, and many other Dota 2 players, stand.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this is an excellnt game if you want a really dynamic playstyle and a unique item shop which offers much variation. The reason i choose dota over LoL is beacuse of the friendly community and the helpful players i often find in the games who are always willing to help me out if im stuck with what to buy or when they're telling me i shouldn't be initiating teamfights as the courier but whatever this game is great i'd give it a solid 7/10 just beacuse it's such an easy game to pick up after about 100 games you will have the basics mastered like how to last hit the minions and once you have that down you can learn how to kill your own minions to deny gold which is pretty hard and i still can't do it properly. I hope that in the next 20 games or so in can manage to get the basics of jungling down because it's very complicated and i always forget to eat the trees for health LOL. yes would reccomend definately to any new players looking for an online moba game which is really easy to pick up and get going aftert 10 games.

												This game was the best way I have ever ruined my life and will continue to be the bane of my exsistence for a long time to come.  If you get this game, it is only fair to tell you that the 1000-2000 mmr is worse then any plague.  If you find your self in it, you will be better off with a healthy dose of arsenic or, if you have any type of honor you will commit seppuku. In any case, if you live a nice and healthy life stay the ***k away from this game but, then again you have steam account so your probably don't have a life any way.It may seem I had mostly negative things to say but, in all honesty the negative in this game doesn't compare to the feeling of going 20/3/10 and having the entire other team spamming for our team to report their good support because the mid lost and the carry just finished a 30 min battle fury as their first real item.Lastly, If this game were a lady, sure she would be a b**** but, hotter then hell 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When you play for the first time all this game seems like is just a bunch of wierd colored creatures punching each other with sticks. It seems really stupid, but you suck it up and play through the tutorial. Then you stupidly decide to play your first game of real dota. Put short you fed, badly.After going 0/30 your first game you kinda hate dota. But you stupidly decide to play another, and chances are you lost again.  And this keeps happening until you discover your first newb hero. Drow seems so op doesnt she. Afterwards you decide to play this hero again and again, and doesn't it feel good to win.50 games deep you'll hate noobstomp heroes like riki, sniper, drow, and bloodseeker. Obvisously these heroes are really op.100 games deep and you'll find yourself trying out some new heroes, tidehunters ravange is pretty epic you have to agree.200 games deep and you'll have played every hero, with the exception to earth spirt. How the hell do you play that guy, I dont get it.300 games deep and those newb stomp heroes dont seem so bad anymore. Manfight riki, stand right next to drow, get blademail for sniper, and buy a tp for bloodseeker. And dont forget to buy dust.400 games in you will know how to ward, rune control, stack and pull and play a support. You will understand the basics of having one person farm while another supports and harrasses. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥you've made it to 500 games. Remeber your first match if only you could see yourself now. By this point you understand the basics of dota! Remeber to dodge the sunstrike!600 games in and you'll realize that for the past months dota is the only game you have played. Like the only game, because once you start playing dota you never come back. Unless your power dies....By 700 games you'll start playing against trilanes. Now as an offlaner you have to do your best to not die, and get some farm. Hide in the trees and sap xp where you can.By 800 your tempted to buy that arcana. Not saying you will but it sure does look tempting. By 900 you know what to buy, and you get what every hero can do. You know where to be and when and you get the feeling when there smoke ganking and roshing. Gamesense op!By 1000 games you hit a milestone. The game doesnt seem like colored creatures punching eachother. Welcome to dota 2.Noob Advice: read guides when your trying out new heroes. Practice in bots, and dont stick to one hero, play them all. And stick in there, your first 10 games will suck. Purge has some great guides that you really should watch before you even step into your first game. And also play with friends, otherwise you might have to put up with peruvians who keep screaming noob in chat when you make one mistake. People who have to rage at everything (thats why theres reports), and russians who will play uber aggresive all the time, which to be fair on there part works half of the time. Welcome to dota 2. Oh yeah and nerf void! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game will allow you to expand your vocabulary and learn other languages while playing. Meet people from all around the third world and learn their fantastic languages as you jolly communicate with them.You'll also find the best matchmaking system ever known to man, that puts you with EVENLY SKILLED PLAYERS no matter what, and a report system that will punish toxic players that trash talk or feed, 10000% guaranteed.In this long escalation of skills you'll find better players as you improve. It's one game you'll never want to stop playing, teamwork, communication and frinedliness are in the order of the day. Greatly recommended to anyone that enjoys teamwork and competitive teamwork oriented games.----------------------It took me 3300 hours to finally quit this game, honestly I can't say I regret having played it for so long. I did have lots of fun and I managed to reach 4k mmr without issues, after patch 7.00 I lost interest and I haven't played since December 2016 or so. There's better games out there and better genres, but few games can say they can compete with being such an effective, addictive time sink. Three thousand hours of my life down the drain and I don't even regret it. If only I had spent that time learning to program better or other useful things instead I might not be unemployed right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why I am unistalling Dota 2 after patch 7.00:First I have loved Dota and put in a lot of time - 1700hrs.Patch 7.00 add complexity but doesnt address the issues that face the game:Toxic community: Although there are reports and commends there are still rude players who play in almost every game. The reporting system does not seem to deal with this. I suggest a social ranking which is used for public match making as well as mmr. Social ranking could be determined as a function of commends v reports.Supports: I play supports almost exclusively. The reason is that if I dont I cant rely on anyone else to. I spend a lot gold on support items at the expense of developing my hero. It is a grind. Because I regularly play supports my level almost always lags behind others so I will rarely see a lot of the new high level options. The new changes do little to make playing a support more enjoyable. Wards should be free and on a timer.Map change: I hate the new map. Visibility is reduced, wards are less effective, it will become a gankers paradise since you cannot ward as effectively. For a prodominently support player who normally takes the role of hard carry baby sitter that is not a prospect I like.EDIT:Snowballing. Talents will accelerate snowballing. My suspicion is that means that the team that handles the transfer from laning phase to ganking phase most efficiently will have a significant advantage. My prediction is stats will show that the team that is dominate after 15 minutes will win almost all games.I doubt anyone from Valve will read this but there it is.So long and thanks for all the fish.

Cut out the stuff that isn't mission critical to the actual experience and the clash of skills between two sides and you would get League though, so I suppose there is a place for this.Also, Valve is a much better dev team than Riot is, hands down, its just a shame that the games they own aren't reversed.

												I've played this game since I was in my highschool, Dota 1 days were surely a jumpstart for me. Now I'm a licensed Interior Designer and I still play this game. In-game items make this game a whole lot more interesting than before. But since I'm a new player, it's sad to know that DYNAMIC PRESENTS are now unavailable. Rendering Old Players an edge of having good set of items while New ones can never have while they level up. So this makes leveling up your dota profile a bit of useless to me. Leveling up a profile knowing that there is no use or benefit can be disappointing at some point. And hopefully soon there will be an AUTOBAN for rude players in-game. Some sort of a ""PROFANE"" word detection thru out any language. There are a lot of rude and tactless players out there that can most of the time disappoint newbies from playing the game. Not everyone though. But nonetheless, this game is still as awesome for me as it was before in Dota 1. Very nice graphics and enjoyable game. Keep up the good work!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dota2 often claimed to be the hardest MOBA there is and that is because the game is very complex, which is why there is a ~10 hour tutorial trying to breakdown the game mechanics into little pieces and if you want to get faster and easier into it you can't avoid watching videos for more tips'n'tricks, which makes this game very time consuming, not to mention that an average game is between 30 and 50 minutes long.However when you dig yourself through the wall of Dota2 and got to the point, where you start understanding what you are doing wrong. Then the game gets very rewarding and fun. Playing Dota2 is a combination of strategy - which hero to pick, where to lane, what items to buy and satisfying combat, one hero usually has 4 abilities and one of them being there ultimate ability, which is the hero's strongest ability, for newbies, there are a lot of hero's with passives and few abilities.Something, which I don't usually mention in reviews, is the voice acting, this game, although it has 108 different characters, has really good voice acting for every single hero. Although the game is getting to get a bit older now, its graphics are definetly up to date and personally I really like the water, it looks really good.Overall if have a lot of spare time and for a very strategic in-depth game go for it! It is free and you have excess to all heroes from Level 0 on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looks like I've got some new stories to tell. In former times Dota 2 was a great game to play. Actually it was more than just a game. If you were looking for something that could easily eat days and days and days of your life, Dota 2 was an excellent choice, the real and absolute time killer. While it was pretty tough to get into at the start, then it was causing almost immediate addiction just like some drugs works. It was a game that could easily ruin your social life, relationship, education, career, everything you loved before. Dota, in general, has been in version 6.xx for more than 10 years, since 2005 - the Dota All-stars mod days. Let’s be honest, Valve has been working on Dota 2 for years, constantly improving the game, adding new items, bringing some minor and significant changes. They kept the game evolving, fresh and alive. Over the last four and a half years the game reached a magnificent state of balance with 6.88 that lasted for 6 months. The preceding patch was remarkably well-balanced with no heroes considered unviable and a broad range of strategies to use. But everything has its end. The new journey has begun. The shift from 6.88f to 7.00 on December 12, 2016 marked the end of Dota 2. The beloved game formerly known as Dota 2 is dead now. 7.00 has introduced a variety of game-breaking changes. The game is completely imbalanced and totally broken now. Dev team decided to attract a new players, making Dota 2 easier to adapt for players coming from other MOBA’s like League of Legends, Heroes of Newerth and Heroes of the Storm, while losing the uniqueness of the game and ditching it’s loyal fans. Valve just ruined a game which didn’t needed a major gameplay change or anything by fixing something that wasn’t broken.  GG WP			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Of the majority of games that feature animal people, I don't think any other game of our generation can shout BLATANT FURRY CULTURE FORCING more than Dota 2. Ranging from the down and dirty Gondar lines like ""for the right price, anything"" to the drunk, pitiful Mangix; and you thought Disney was bad.On top of that they even added a character called ""Troll Warlord"" which is obviously a Homestuck reference. These guys are really milking the fandom department. Why can't a game just be about boobs like the old day- I mean what ever happened to good old Christian family values like Monopoly and Scrabble. Now we've gotta fill our games with fanservice and sell out to an audience that is somehow greater than ours? I don't think so. And there's even a character that's a flamboyant homosexual. I had to bring my children to therapy after they heard the words ""puddin pop"" from one such ""Storm Spirit"".On the topic of inappropriate directive, I can't believe a Greek Gorgon such as Medusa would go so far as to talk about her 'gays'. This is simply not alright.This ""game"" is nothing but a manifestation of what our society is becoming, and we can only petition to have Valve remove funding for this project to save our youth.

												A game that isn't for the faint of heart. While not matching the level of gore or horror in other game, Dota 2 and other MOBA's will get your heart and blood pumping like no other games. Its highly competetive nature is both its best and worst feature though as people sometimes can't get over the fact they just got owned by another player or are about as graceful as a dancing hippo when they own another player.I'm not entirely bothered either way, this is a great game with insanly compelling mechanics. At the low low price of nothing, this is a must try.A more detailed look at Dota 2, its history and its significance can be found in my review of it on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2013/08/dota-2.html.

												A maelstrom of anger, fear, disillusionment and sheer ecstasy - Dota 2 is all these things and more. You’ll learn to hate your friends and love random strangers during the forty five minutes of an average match. In that short span of time, grudges will be born, heroes will rise and poor plays will be vilified like a G R R Martin epic. And yet for all its emotional drama, both highs and lows, you’ll still yearn for more. Just learning to play is an adventure into masochism. Everyone begins as a dreaded n00b, unable to contribute anything but gold and XP to the opposing team. A few weeks later and they’ll have learned a few tricks: where to place wards, how to turn off auto attack in the options and, crucially, the ability to take abuse on the chin without rage quitting. Give it a few months and they’ll be rolling with the regulars. Double stacking, recrowing and GGWP will become part of their vernacular. Immunity to the insults will be delivered upon their chins which have since grown thick with stubble and caloused skin. They'll have succesfully joined an inclusive club whose members include the heroes of the world's burgeoning e-sports scene. Consider the football metaphor, pub matches are like a kick about down the local park using the same boots, strips and footballs Rooney, Messi and Neymar use in packed stadiums full of shouting people.      If all of the above sounds a bit much then ask yourself: What’s the point of playing if you don’t feel something in the end?  Dota 2 delivers passion and fury in spades, and like all great games its hidden depths forever tease like sirens upon the rocks, always ready to punish an overblown sense of ego.

												Итак Dota 2 - игра для тех кто умеет размышлять и кто не является ""тормозом"".Давайте же рассмотрим плюсы и минусы этой игры.Начнем с минусов, хоть и каждый, имеющий  желание отнести эту игру к самому отрицательному, из всего с чем он сталкивался когда либо, способен найти для себя очень много минусов dota 2, но а я рассмотрю самые банальные.1. В процессе игры человек познает всю силу и мощь русского языка, а точнее ненормативной лексики, которая встречается довольно часто в ходе игры.2. Из-за сильных переживаний, как за своего героя так и за качество игрового процессе у союзников, повышается вероятность психологического расстройства, а все потому что в игре встречаюся, так называемые ""Раки"" (чаще на миду).-""Рак""(днище, нуб, ракал, лол и т.д.)- зто один (несколько) игроков в вашей команде, которые просто шокируют своим профессиОНАЛизмом игры в dota 2. Многие из таких игРАКов даже утверждают о том, что имели возможность""наказывать"" ваших близких и родственников, с помощью полового вмешательства.3. Матч длится, в среднем 30-40 минут, и таких матчей может быть больше 15 за день, все потраченное время на игры можно было провести с пользой для себя или же для близких вам людей. Как можно назвать, то время которое вы потратили, за сутки, играя в dota 2? Пожалуй я назову это время - ""пустотой"".Минусы, в любой ситуации, найти намного проще, чем плюсы, но все же я попытаюсь это сделать.1. Многие считают, что ничего положительного нет в игре, но а как же мышление, память, помощь союзнику по команде, даже немного математики присутствует, и это все положительные стороны игры.2. Dota 2 помогает научится расчитывать своего героя приимущества и приимущества противника, а также недостатки как свои так и его, бывают ситуации когда это все нужно расчитать за пару секунд. Для всего этого необходимо знание героев, предметов, ну и конечно немного интуиции.3. Я всегда задавался вопросом, как это однообразие карты, героев и цели игры, не надоедает игроку? На самом деле каждая игра это ""маленькая жизнь"", которую проживаешь всегда на одной и той же карте, но всегда с новыми людьми, сколько людей, столько и вариантов развития игрового процесса. Поэтому никакого постояного, раздражающего, однообразия - нет и быть не может. А вывод из всего этого, что каждый сам для себя решает, положительное воздействие или отрицательное дает ему эта игра.p.s. Не игра меняет человека в плохую или же хорошую сторону, а человек должен сам себя настраивать, только вот ""ЗА"" или ""ПРОТИВ"" игры, решить должен сам за себя а не игра за тебя или же мнение окружающих. Ты - сам себе хозяин и в силах настроить себя куда угодно!!! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am Jose, i used to be believe that i was a casual player, til my mind changed entirely. i started to play DOTA1 when i was 9 years old, i started DOTA2 3 years ago.Getting out of a gaming addiction can be really hard. Its very underrated, people think it's just a video game, its nothing. But an addiction is an addiction, From personal experience I can tell you that cutting down your time playing DOES NOT WORK. At least it didn't for me. It's much easier to stop completely. I cant stop and im not planning on doing it. However, You need to make up your mind and JUST PUT AN END TO IT. Unless you plan on being a professional gamer. and I am kinda working on it. This is a great game, you can have a lot of fun, you need skills. a lot of practice. and PATIENCE. Players of all kinds in this game, from the most toxic, to the most charismatic, I like to believe i am part of the cool ones, even tho the number of reports i get everyday is hella big Lol.  I am into Dota 2 for about 3.5 years. It initially started as a casual pastime and later turned into a full blown addiction. Even in college. And it got to a point that I was bunking classes almost everyday to sit in my room and play DOTA for 9-10 hours straight. I was on numerous Dota forums, all I thought about was how I could get better at Dota. My life was Dota. One of the main reasons behind the addictiveness of Dota 2 is that you are able to escape your real life problems and unlike your real life, you are in full control of your character in Dota 2 which makes it even more enticing, along with other things which I am sure you already know. Why is my nickname ""Addicted"" ?- Its actually funny cause it was my high school principal who told me to call me like that.         Its a pretty good game, but BE AWAREPeruvians and russians are coming for you..Addicted ^^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. It's hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. It took me a long time to warm up to, but I'm helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. If you can spare the time - play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing DotA 1 since 2003. I switched to DotA 2 a couple months ago from all my friends shifting over. Here is a short list of pros and cons that I have seen in DotA 2 as opposed to DotA 1.Pros:* Better mechanics, many heros function differently in DotA 1 due to the restrictions of the Warcraft 3 World Editor.* Visually stimulating, DotA 2 has many ways to customize heros, couriers, wards, animations, and more.* Item drops, as opposed to DotA 1, even casual players can end up making some money just by playing.* Spectating* Much easier for new players to learn due to the new system to help starting players.* Builds display on the item panel* Has many events in which additional items can be earned* Has an in game mic system as well as quick toggle phrases.Cons:* Currently doesn’t have all the heros or neutral camps that DotA 1 has.* Lacks some of the game modes of DotA 1.* Surprisingly, lacks some of the important mechanics of DotA 1. The most notable one that I can pull off the top of my head is Batrider’s napalm does not trigger any damage bonus on radiance + veil even when the threshold for doing so is met.* Servers tend to be down for a brief period of time after nearly every update.* Doesn’t have as well of a language division as DotA 1. I que US east and west with the language of English in DotA 2; yet 1:3 games, if not more, will have another language. I wouldn’t even mind if it was something like Spanish or French, but I am getting everything from Russian, Chinese, Portuguese, Ukraine, Korean, Japanese, and many more that I can’t even identify. * Double courier is a lot harder to use in DotA 2, even with hotkeys and grouping. I find this to take away from bottle crowing as well as make it harder for 2 farmers to get their items quickly for they will likely be on the opposite sides of the map. Even if they aren’t, the offlane will still likely need it to get items to survive. Every game will only have 1 courier unless someone accidentally buys another.Neutral:* DotA 2 has much better pathing and makes it harder to get stuck on unpathable areas. This makes sure you will never stupidly get stuck somewhere, but also takes away from some hero abilities that do move other heroes or yourself. * There is currently no public lobby system. There is everything from private, fiends, guild, etc., but there is no way to host them publicly for anyone to join.* Your computer needs to be decent to run DotA 2. At least 4 GB of ram and a decent graphics card is highly advised.In conclusion, DotA 2 is definitely a f2p game that you should look into. If you have yet to play any MOBA it may seem a bit difficult at first, but it will grow on you. To avoid the initial hate you may come across, I advise having someone assist you with learning the basics or look up some tutorials online. Going into this game with absolutely no knowledge of how this game works is definitely not a good idea. Once you learn the game, it can easily become the most enjoyable strategy game you have ever played.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are reading reviews do yourself a favor, check the number of hours of people who are reviewing the game within the last month, you'll start to see a pattern. Most of the negative reviews come from players who have been playing this game over 1k hours and positive reviews come from people who have less than 300hours. After 2k hours of gameplay I gotta say with deep regret this last update (7.00) ruined the game. The HUD itself is poorly implemented. A lot of crucial features are missing. Since 2009 till today Dota has been about adding new heroes with new abilities, challenging old and very well crafted strategies, improving the experience over and over again. Sadly, after 7.0, the game has lost its learning curve, there are tons of ways to  make money, to stay safe, to regain mana or xp. Classic heroes have been turned into something completely different, abilities are now a deformed and unbalanced version of what they were. It took YEARS to get a proper balanced between heroes but all that feedback, experience, knowledge is GONE. Dota 2 is now a crippled version of what it used to be, arguably similar to other MOBAS out there.  And don't even get me started on kids...7.00 has turned the game into a playground for 12 year olds. Why? The short answer, this a new game and an easier version of what it used to be. Edit: Furthermore,New players don't really care for this game. They don't give two ogre magi sh*ts about it. Like their way of thinking is "" YES!! I don't suck anymore and everyone is as lost as I'am so woohoo great game!"" We on the other hand have spent THOUSANDS of hours playing it. In some cases mastering heroes and techniques but screw us right? Players who made this game into what it is today...I don't know who is rsponsable for this but to you sir or lady ""screw you too"" You have made a huge bargain with 7.00 Hard dedicated players who have invested not only hours but money into this game will leave, there are a ton of mobas out there. And I feel awful for saying this becuase for years I've stayed with dota and never even thought about trying LoL, HON, Heroes of the storm...the list goes on. So lets see how much casual players and 10 yearolds spent into this game after 7.00.Allow me to make a prediction, you'll realize you've made a huge mistake and give the community what they want maybe in a ""classic"" dota version of the game or you'll realize it too late and its byebye for sure. You are gonna end up charging money for heroes. I can see it now $20 for a ""Classic hero pack"" .... **SMH**Casual players and 12 year olds have ruined this game for good. R.I.P DOTA 2			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I started off hating this game due to its massive learning curve, and quite frankly that is a good thing to hate about it, some people don't want to dedicate a lot time of to ONE game, that's understandable.I put 10-15hrs into it across a few weeks and then uninstalled it.A year later I jump back into the game and gave it an ACTUAL try.They added a tutorial, after I finished that; learning a few things along the way, I starting playing easy bot practices with a few easier heroes.The game's less complicated than it is on surface, once you get going certain things quickly become easier, however certain things take a long time to learn which is where its learning curve comes into play.That's where a lot of people (including myself at a point) are put off by this game, LoL is an easier alternative.But once you break past those first few (horrible, death filled) matches of you being confused as hell and making a ton of mistakes the game really starts to shine.You see the depth the game contains, the tactics.You start to get sucked in (if you're anything like me.)You start finding heroes that suit your tastes.THAT is where the game shines.Once you've put about 30hrs in you're probably bored of bot matches, so public matches here you come.This is where the game is the best, and also where it's the worst.The game can get very intense, if you're with the right people; a lot of teamwork will come into play.But (especially for a newbie) this is where the game is at it's worst.The community in this game is among the worst I've ever seen.You will be yelled at for making minor (or major) mistakes, for some reason they don't realise you're new, and they were to at some point.You have to start somewhere with Dota, so with all of the above in mind, do you want to start?

""Their sanity I'll shatter. Their dreams of conquest I'll destroy.""Of Warcraft’s “Custom Maps,” one stood a little taller than the rest: “Defense of the Ancients.” Here the heroes of Azeroth, freed from the tedious management of cities and armies, could fight as they were meant to: with weapons and experience, teamwork and tactics, all unadulterated by some abstract general and convoluted mission. A vast pool of heroes, pulled into one map, normalized and equalized through patches, armed with improved weaponry, combined to cement a gameplay experience that appealed to our encyclopedic minds, our fantastical tendencies, and our social impulse. Here was an unthinkable union of knowledge, skill, mythology, role playing, individuality, and balance. Here DotA matured to perfection.But this perfection was uneven. The brilliance lay there, but burdened by the crust and grime of history. The game’s greatest hero, Ice Frog, was a player who saw in DotA a wondrous achievement and vowed not to let that masterpiece deteriorate and die. Seeing the game as a growing process, owned by a community, ever meant to experiment and improve, Ice Frog’s leadership kept DotA alive. Suffocated by a dated engine and forgotten game, he and his team worked with the legion of adoring fans to nourish what could be saved, and eradicate what could not. But even tenacity has limits, and in order for DOTA to break free it needed a new body; a new platform in which to siege the world. Here, as ever, an angel swooped from above. It was Valve, and they released the building pressure of DOTA into the atmosphere of mainstream gaming; steam that would finally power the community it deserved.The rest is history. Adopting the FTP model, utilizing the source engine and steam community, DotA has its outlet: DOTA 2. Players marvel at the game’s sheer number of balanced heroes, how it feels difficult yet strangely compelling, sophisticated in its strategy but gleeful in its murder, at times silly but still dark, oppressive but always promising emancipation if you practice hard and reflect often, so reliant on your allies, often complete strangers, that autonomous action can never rival teamwork. Like members of a symphony, clashing with your enemies in near perfect tug-and-war, entailing chess-like prediction and FPS-like twitching, your team fights together, wins together, and dies together. Never before except in professional sports has your weakest link dragged you down or raised you up.But drag you down they do. Even in the most porcelain masks do we see blemishes, and DOTA 2 has its fair share. Teams can and do exploit the weakest member of the opposite team, bullying with a savagery only seen in competitive gaming. Because of this exploitation, and the difficult nature of the game as a whole, frustration often runs high in the experience. Losses feel more painful than wins feel enjoyable, and the hope for those rare games in which perfect harmony among both teams leads to razor-sharp tactics and thrilling plays can be ruined by the cruel hand of fate, where a single hero out of position or a single RNG move can turn the tide of battle. DOTA 2 is, paradoxically, rarely satisfying, but when it is players never forget that feeling of triumph.Video Games, more than any other art, rely on us to deliver an experience. Whether they tell a story or present puzzles to solve, games need us to be competent and attentive. DOTA 2 takes this to new heights, and presents us with an outlet where the more we pour into it, the more it gives back. Eventually our exhaustion clouds the luster somewhat, but we shouldn’t judge the game by our own limitations. Feral, profound, and terrifically challenging, DOTA 2 is competitive team-based gaming in its prime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all Dota is the best game I have ever played. Before I´m going into details I just have to say that I recommend the  game for everyone. It can be fun and challenging and it is mostly very well balanced (compare to other game of this genre)Positive:-It´s free to play and not pay to win-There are like over 110 heroes to choose and everyone got it´s own special play style-It´s a very great game to play with friends -The game is based on high skill, sometimes a bit luck and of course on teamplay-The game has a ""never give"" up effect -Once you started to play Dota 2, you wont every be able to stop playing it-The workshop adds nice new thing into the game like skins (Made for fans by fans)-There are many cool gamemodes-The competitive scence is very fun to watch and you can learn very much from the pros-There are many reallife events based on Dota 2 like the TI-The game never gets boring-It´s like a passionNegative:-Let´s be honest: The Community(There are so many arrogant and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people in Dota 2 that sometimes it´s just make me wanna cry and that´s of course very brutal for noobs. But i have to say just move on and play, ignore these stupid players)-In my perspective, Dota 2 is very well balanced but there are still heroes who are just too strong and broke which can frustrate hard-Language problems(There are like in every game some Russians who think they can freely write russian in the chat although it´s an english server. I think that´s unrespectful towards the people who actually write english although they are also from other countries besides Russia like me)-Pauses(Seriously these unpauses ♥♥♥♥s everyone up and nobody is able to wait for like 3 minutes -.-)My rating for Dota 2 would be 95 out of 100That´s all from me. Hope you enjoyed my review and see ya !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dota 2.Well, Dota 2 is definitely the best game I have ever played in my whole life.From this game I gained so many awesome friends,mates and never felt bored while playing with them. It's a fun game if played with friends. Dota 2 requires TeamWork in order to win the game properly. Dota 2 is purely based on Skill. And I said this for four reasons : 1-Counter picking.2-Map awareness.3-When to start a team fight when to defend.4-Picking right items.Plus the more you play Dota 2, the more you want to learn about the game, and then you will enjoy playing it more than anytime!So actually Dota 2 is more like a team game. But playing solo is an other story...In solo matchmaking TeamWork is laughable. People will most likely tell you what to do step by step. If you don't follow what they're telling you. [All chat] ""report player"". Your random teammates will blame you for every single mistake you have done. And they won't even try to help you. They will just start insulting you in [All chat] and this will result to a lost game. I have tried to be nice with all my teammates when playing SOLO but as everytime, it's either I carry the team or I will lose the game. it's my mates attitude, I rarely get to play with people who speaks English properly. I will always get the ""♥♥♥♥♥♥squad"" spamming in [All chat], ""REPORT INVOKER NO GANK!!"" ""♥♥♥♥♥♥blat, adi nahoo"". I'm not quite sure what they're saying, but I'm positive, they're insulting me or my mother, most of the time. Well of course there are nice guys, but they are rare. Overall this game is awesome  and somewhat addictive. B E C A R E F U L L. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*EDIT: I've played this game for a couple more thousand hours and have managed to climb my way through the trench and it's safe to say people never change. Now I get to play with high-pro level players who still have the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ trench attitude and instalock cores, and go into the iron talon + woods whenever there core gets taken. GG VOLVO**EDIT 2: I'm pretty sure Arteezy is 100% the cause of all this ♥♥♥♥in toxicity. Everytime someone dies they say ""GG END MID"" and use mic to do the stupid ""arteezy chuckle"" because lel i jerk off to rtz strm l8 at niGht WHen My PArentZ R AsleEPLel Look Atm me BAd MusizZ BarBIe Rage xD Gg Teem So SBSayed LMNfao Who caRES*This game is absolutely the worst experience I've ever had to sit through for a multitude of slow-paced hours. Never in my life have I had to put up with so many mexicans, russians, french, Iroquoians and africans who refuse to play on their local servers and play on US West. After politely asking foreigners to speak english while on US West servers, they respond with reports, death threats and various other verbal abuses. This game has also taught me many skills in terms of raging. Never in my life have I been able to creatively use 14 swear words in 1 sentence, all because of a ♥♥♥♥ing Riki throwing an hour and a half match by building assault cuirrass and wondering around into an enemy team.If all this game is a great game to play if you struggle with pride issues. The game's brilliant matchmaking will take 8 minutes to help you get paired up with players clearly above your league, just for the sake of getting you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in every possible area (many you never even knew existed). Additionally, the 8 minute matchmaking system will also pair you with downies, russians, autists and Josh Elliot, who will all most likely blame their 20 minute loss on you. Oh, also before I forget, there is a lack of a surrender button so you if things go♥♥♥♥♥♥up for your team, ♥♥♥♥ you, you have to sit through an hour of watching the entire enemy team snowball, and if they want to prolong the game by not pushing when they can, ♥♥♥♥ you, you have to sit through it. Of course, there is a way to skip this, and that is by abandoning. After abandoning a match, you will play in a low priority pool for X amount of games. The low priority pool is where you will finally get a chance to play with fellow American players who speak your language as they are too, people just like you who rage quit a match after hearing ""Chinga tu madre"" dozens of times thanks to the addition of high quality voice chat. With all these factors of the game, it is bound to lower anyone's self esteem and realize that they are nothing without their team mates and they are forced to make friends if they are to win a game.Overall, I give this game an 8/8 m8 a must buyGreat if you want to learn different languages, lower your self esteem, suffer from anger issues and screw your life over. I love it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*EDIT: I've played this game for a couple more thousand hours and have managed to climb my way through the trench and it's safe to say people never change. Now I get to play with high-pro level players who still have the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ trench attitude and instalock cores, and go into the iron talon + woods whenever there core gets taken. GG VOLVO**EDIT 2: I'm pretty sure Arteezy is 100% the cause of all this ♥♥♥♥in toxicity. Everytime someone dies they say ""GG END MID"" and use mic to do the stupid ""arteezy chuckle"" because lel i jerk off to rtz strm l8 at niGht WHen My PArentZ R AsleEPLel Look Atm me BAd MusizZ BarBIe Rage xD Gg Teem So SBSayed LMNfao Who caRES*This game is absolutely the worst experience I've ever had to sit through for a multitude of slow-paced hours. Never in my life have I had to put up with so many mexicans, russians, french, Iroquoians and africans who refuse to play on their local servers and play on US West. After politely asking foreigners to speak english while on US West servers, they respond with reports, death threats and various other verbal abuses. This game has also taught me many skills in terms of raging. Never in my life have I been able to creatively use 14 swear words in 1 sentence, all because of a ♥♥♥♥ing Riki throwing an hour and a half match by building assault cuirrass and wondering around into an enemy team.If all this game is a great game to play if you struggle with pride issues. The game's brilliant matchmaking will take 8 minutes to help you get paired up with players clearly above your league, just for the sake of getting you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in every possible area (many you never even knew existed). Additionally, the 8 minute matchmaking system will also pair you with downies, russians, autists and Josh Elliot, who will all most likely blame their 20 minute loss on you. Oh, also before I forget, there is a lack of a surrender button so you if things go♥♥♥♥♥♥up for your team, ♥♥♥♥ you, you have to sit through an hour of watching the entire enemy team snowball, and if they want to prolong the game by not pushing when they can, ♥♥♥♥ you, you have to sit through it. Of course, there is a way to skip this, and that is by abandoning. After abandoning a match, you will play in a low priority pool for X amount of games. The low priority pool is where you will finally get a chance to play with fellow American players who speak your language as they are too, people just like you who rage quit a match after hearing ""Chinga tu madre"" dozens of times thanks to the addition of high quality voice chat. With all these factors of the game, it is bound to lower anyone's self esteem and realize that they are nothing without their team mates and they are forced to make friends if they are to win a game.Overall, I give this game an 8/8 m8 a must buyGreat if you want to learn different languages, lower your self esteem, suffer from anger issues and screw your life over. I love it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Between two accounts, I have logged in, arguably, too much time. I think its around 1800 hours. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS WITH 7.00. I agree with most the negative reviews of this new update. They completely changed what was already a great game. They had a solid (and diehard loyal) group of players and 7.00 is like spitting in our mouths and telling us its champagne. I see what they're doing. Valve wants to appeal to a younger generation of players that does not (I repeat) does not want to play Dota 2. That is why they play League of Legends or Heroes of the Storm or Smite. They want a fast paced game that requires little to no knowledge of tactics, strategy or the game's mechanics. I used to say Dota 2 was the chess of MOBAs; difficult and requiring more skill to play than the checkers of MOBAs like League. Now with 7.00, Dota has become a checkers MOBA.Give me back my tactical MOBA, give us back our Chess. Valve, revert the changes back to 6.88 and turn the changes for 7 into DOTA 3. Don't♥♥♥♥♥♥on your loyal players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At this point I can't recommend this game anymore. It sucks if you have literally no one that will play it with you. The only good thing about this game was playing it with a few friends, but if you don't have anyone to play it with avoid. Dota 2 is one of those games that takes a lot of time to get even moderately ok at, time that could be spent playing something else more rewarding. It's still a good game don't get me wrong, it's just playing it on your own is too much of a chore for me. At this point I probably won't pick it up ever again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though I used to hate this game, I eventually got into it. It will frustrate noods, but eventually, when you learn the basics and other things as such, it becomes a great game. I recommend new players to research about the game and play offline a good few hours beforehand, and get to know this challenging game. It does not welcome noobs with a easy tutorial, its jump in head first.In all. I like this game. I don't love it, but It is still a good play, and a good game to play on routine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												7.0 is the worst update ever made to a game.All versions before this were like a piece of art.  The game used to be ingenious, requiring real skill and understanding of how different roles, between carry and support, accomplish victory. Now, the game is a cartoony arcade. The HUD is horrible.  The colors of the game are too vibrant, almost cartoonish. The flow is too fast.  It's essentially an arcade game for kids.I could get used to new change but when you mess the interface that much and i have to squint to see everything and I get a headache after, not gonna happen..RIP Dota..

												Well there is no need to tell you much about this game. It's just so popular. Many people consider this game as a piece of artwork. True is that it needs a lot of skills to be good in it. To be honest it's just not my type of game, anyway I recommend to try ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DotA 2; What is there you didn't want in a game?This game; Yes can be frustrating and unforgiving and yes can be hard to get used to, BUT that is the fun in which this game provides you with.You may struggle to survive in the jungle against a five man gank and continuously get slaughtered but as a team and with strategies, you and your team can survive to become the victors at the end of the game.When I first started playing this game I had a hard time getting used to MOBA's and never had seen them before which in turn made it so much more difficult for me to understand what was going on but with the support of my mates I learnt and gradually got better.I would strongly reccommed new players to play a few hours of Bot games first because going online with no experience (like I did) doesn't benifit your team, yes you may win but was it worth all the jeering and crude comments from both your own team for feeding and the opposition for being quite horrible at the game?But MOST importantly you MUST have Fun.

												Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena game from Valve. Dota 2 is the next installment from the previous game or mods Dota.Dota 2 has the same gameplay as Dota. You pick your heroes, and then battle them in one map against another player. In the arena, as you kill and progress you will get coins and the use them to buy items to enhance your heroes on your current battle in the arena. You need to pick the right items each time you play as it will decide you will win the game or not. Dota 2 introduce item drops each time you finish a match online. There are many items in Dota 2 that can enhance your favourite heroes looks. Each item has rarity, the more rare the items, the more expensive it will become. Most items can be sold in the Steam Marketplace.Dota 2 has far improved graphics from the previous game. Heroes are even more detailed and the arena has better view. All heroes ability effects are also improved, even the UI is better.Dota 2 has many tournaments that you can participate. The biggest is ""The International"" Dota 2 tournament. Most tournaments can reward players with some rare items just by watching the tournaments.Dota 2 is the best MOBA game yet. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It provides nothing and only makes you progressively more angry. 2 days ago marked my 2 year anniversary with my beloved Dota and I'm ashamed to say that I must depart. I hope others out there realize this game for what it is before I did. Cheers, on to better things...Update:To those saying I lied your not wrong.

												Still waiting for Volvo to giff Diretide.Fun game, better played with friends however becuse the main problem is the community. Most players you encounter will not speak english, so it may benefit you to have a russian, portugese, and spanish dictionary at your side. If you are new to the game DO NOT USE THE BUILDS YOU SEE PROS USE. They build SITUATIONALLY. The builds they use are not good for every situation. At all.Also if you do not take criticism well, Dota2 is not for you. The worst player on your team will blame you for everything that goes wrong. Like seriously if you can't handle an insult play something else. These people are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Regardless of the community and the lack of Diretide, overall Volvo did a good job on Dota. Graphics are great, mechanics are great, and it is a fun time overall besides the general rudeness of other. There generally are very few bugs with the game and it generally runs very smoothly. If you are new I strongly recommend doing training before anything else, and playing against bots until you are fairly confident in yourself. It takes time for you to fully understand Dota, and no, you can not jump. Hopefully next update you'll be able to (wink wink Volvo).Unlike other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MOBAs *cough cough* League *cough cough* you do not have to spend ANY money on Dota. The only things there is to buy is cosmetic items, which you will be able to get for free as soon as Volvo fixes the drop system.I strongly recommend Dota if you don't have friends, a life, or any desire to find love. As Dota will slowly consume your life.And always remember...""♥♥♥♥ magic""  - Anti-Mage			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply put, this game is misogynitic. It does nothing but further harmful female stereotypes and it celebrates patriarchy and he mental, emotional and mostly physical abuse of women.>all of the female characters are supports>they make less money than the men, and are expected to support the male characters who achieve everything>the one female carry, a strong, independent brown transwoman is banned from tournaments, because her mere existence threatens weak white cishetsThis is why Dota will never be taken seriously.

												This is my first time ever reviewing a game on steam and for a good reason. I never thought I would hate to play an almost perfect game before I played Dota 2. The actual design of the game is ridiculously good. It never seems to get old and always pulls me back in even if I'm away for a couple weeks or a month. The worst part about the game is the inherent design of it. In a 5v5 game like Dota 2 if even one person on your team is slightly toxic it can make a difference. Except in Dota nobody is just slightly toxic. They're just absolute cancer. People complain and feed just minutes into the game. And when games can take anywhere from 10-100+ minutes that's a long time-commitment to just have wasted on a toxic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Game is 10/10 but the community is a pile of slarks*Also you will waste your life. You don't think you will when you start. But you will.			",48,4,1,6,2,0,2

												I started playing Dota 2 around 2 years ago, at that time it was still at Beta and I would never have expected that this game would greatly affect my life. When I started I did not have any experience and much expectation of the game, due to the genre - it was all new to me, however before trying out the game it took my friends awhile to get into the game because I did not like the fact the game was still at Beta and at that time I was detesting its predecessor “DotA” due to the fact the gameplay was confusing which it turned me off and also the graphics was years outdated without even trying the game out. I was able to give its successor a chance when a friend of mine introduced the ESports scene within the game community of the genre. I was hooked due to I never have expected that a type of sport has been running for almost a decade which it has been under my radar. I personally was not a fan for Sports in general although after hearing about ESports is completely change my perspective on both of the game and sports. ESports is a term for organized video game competitions, especially between professional. It is known as competitive gaming, professional gaming and cyber sport. The most common video game genres associated with electronic sports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. Generally “Dota 2” would fall under the MOBA genre due to it consists of session-based online multiplayer matches, in which two teams of five players attempt to destroy their opponents' fortified strongholds known as Ancients. Each player controls a ""Hero"" character and, over the course of an individual game, focuses on improving their Hero's abilities, acquiring items, and fighting against the other team.“Welcome to Dota, You Suck”, is a well-known proverb within the DotA Community, which is aimed at new player. In fact is the truth, especially for new to the genre, for the first dozen hours or so, you will be showered with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. On the other hand if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth and complex gameplay, being a free-to-play, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it.That said, you should not expect to have fun on your first day playing... or even your first week. It is due to the unforgiving players within your team which expects you to do your job flawlessly although it is impossible even pro players can make a mistake, however there’s a method of this insanity. In order survive in Dota 2 you need to understand every single hero and mechanics and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold they’d get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities.There are 102 Dota 2 heroes (and counting) each consist of different abilities and mechanics and serves different roles from each other. For example Riki, is an melee Agility hero in which when he acquire his ultimate at level 6 he becomes permanent invisible, which is an obvious choice for most of new player. However there are various ways to counter an invisble heroes, this can be done by purchasing either a “Dust of Apperance, “Sentry Wards” or “Gem of true sight”, anyone can purschase these item during a game, making the game more balanced. In addition some heroes has an ability to track an invis heroes for a short period of time.In conclusion, DOTA 2 is fun and challenging and deeply rewarding unlike other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. It has clear visuals and more balance gameplay unlike League of Legends and has an incredible longevity			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												league of legends is an old-time strategy game developed in 1993 by tesco in collaboration with that guy from the indie game thing. the game is very easy and beginner friendly, clearly inspired by the gameplay mechanics of hey you pikachu. in legend league, the player adventures through maps known as legend lands in order to find all 7 bags of decomposed lamb. the first team to get all 10 of the 33 bags is the winner. the winning team is then awarded with a meat medal which can be spent at the ingame store in exchange for various trinkets and goodies, such as oprah winfrey memoribilia and more copies of the game itself. the graphics are really bad and clearly stolen from fortress craft. look at this for example. what the ♥♥♥♥ is this♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that meant to be a fedora? jesus christ sainsburys at least make an effort. the character roster consists entirely of short humanoids wielding weapons that aren't actually weapons. for example, this is just a midget covered in loo roll right? nope. it's apparently meant to be a magical mummy creature. ♥♥♥♥ing political correctness. the game revolves around the main character, meaty m8 blaze it, and follows him through his journey to save his wife and family from the evil ruler known as notch. an optional hidden storyline can be unlocked after completing the game, in which meaty m8 blaze it attempts to conquer europe and eradicate all minorities within it. in conclusion, it's not as good as other fps games on the market, but still worth buying. i r8 it 8/8 m8.

												When i first started DOTA2 I was a little overwhelmed, as my first ARTS/MOBA game it was pretty complicated. I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. Before I knew it, i was performing лучше and better. I stopped making silly ошибки and я got vastly better and not кормление the enemy команда. For the наиболее part, everyone I've met was very helpful and хороший, there есть the иногда рывоk however. As Я по-прежнемy play DOTA2 вce более и более, Я yвeрeн, чтo я буду прoдoлaжть совершенность. Я рекомендую это игрy для всеx!В России-матушке -

												I love this game and have played for a long time. But with this new 7.00 patch i feel like valved messed up. I can deal with the new ui, map and all the other changes because i think they will be positive in the long run. But they released a buggy patch, and they still have other issues, such as matchmaking to fix. This update seemed rushed, i feel like it is buggy and unenjoyable at best right now. If they fix the bugs and things i feel that this new update will be positive in the longrun if they add a more customizable UI for people like me(who have seeing issues). I just cant recommend it in its current state.			",79,14,0,11,9,3,6

												league of legends is an old-time strategy game developed in 1993 by tesco in collaboration with that guy from the indie game thing. the game is very easy and beginner friendly, clearly inspired by the gameplay mechanics of hey you pikachu. in legend league, the player adventures through maps known as legend lands in order to find all 7 bags of decomposed lamb. the first team to get all 10 of the 33 bags is the winner. the winning team is then awarded with a meat medal which can be spent at the ingame store in exchange for various trinkets and goodies, such as oprah winfrey memoribilia and more copies of the game itself. the graphics are really bad and clearly stolen from fortress craft. look at this for example. what the ♥♥♥♥ is this♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that meant to be a fedora? jesus christ sainsburys at least make an effort. the character roster consists entirely of short humanoids wielding weapons that aren't actually weapons. for example, this is just a midget covered in loo roll right? nope. it's apparently meant to be a magical mummy creature. ♥♥♥♥ing political correctness. the game revolves around the main character, meaty m8 blaze it, and follows him through his journey to save his wife and family from the evil ruler known as notch. an optional hidden storyline can be unlocked after completing the game, in which meaty m8 blaze it attempts to conquer europe and eradicate all minorities within it. in conclusion, it's not as good as other fps games on the market, but still worth buying. i r8 it 8/8 m8.

												This is by FAR the greatest choice making RPG to date.There are over a hundred characters and each character has stunning storys that can change based on your choices. It seems every new game I start has diffrent NPC and voice lines that drive the story through the end. The ending is generally the same wether the Dark lord or light lord wins. This single player RPG allows building of the story through dicisions and item purcheses. Like recently I choose the Character Phantom Assassin and built the powerful mechinism that allowed me to heal my party members. The dialoge on this story line was great though the curse filter was removed as I heard lines from the ever changing juggernuat character such as ""♥♥♥♥ this noob feed loses the game"" and ""She took safe lane for a ♥♥♥♥ing mech?"". though there are still a few bugs such as the one that causes incorrect traslation of the NPCs lines, as in my PA storyline the Puck character was translated in spanish and my ally in arms Keeper Of The Light was incorrectly translated to Russian. Though sad I will miss their dialoge im sure there is much more to come, as I havent had the same dialoge yet in my 3000 hours of gameplay [10/10 would shoot myself.]			",57,5,0,7,7,0,11

												Dota flippin 2, by a long shot my fav game to play on the good ol pc. (not like i play anything else though) This game is prehaps one of the best freetoplay game ever. ok correction, is the best freetoplay game ever. Dota 2 has a very sketchy begining for most players. I really didnt see what was so good about at the begining, it felt........ bland and not very exiting. but after a few matches with my friends and a few good wins, MY LIFE BECAME DEDICATED TO MASTERING THIS GAME. And now ever after 503 hours i still have a very long way to go. Dota 2 has a big learning curve at the begining, as you'll here from every other player. There are so many aspects of the game to learn. But even at the begining it is insainly fun, and as you develop your skill the game becomes more and more enjoyable. And if you get really good you can assemble a worthy team, and if our teams got the skillz to pay the billz you can run for the Dota 2 International championships, however that an very very long shot. but hey the prize money is 10 million flippin dollars this year, and next year it will grow even bigger. So why not try hey.So go flippin get this game and waste thousands of enjoyable hours of your life doing no much.(And please please what ever you do, dont play F**KING RIKI)			",24,0,0,0,2,0,5

												I have been an avid Dota player since beta.  With over 3000 games played and countless hours invested, I clearly enjoyed the game.  I recently took a break after the International, due to the overhype that happens every year with it.  I saw that 7.0 went live (didn't see that coming) and was excited to patch up and start my addiction all over again. After playing a few nights since 7.0 release, I keep asking myself ""wtf is this?""  I don't even know where to begin describing the absolute sh*tshow that this game has become.  I find myself confused constantly, and not because of mechanics or UI, or items, or X...but the overall design that is the package of 7.0.  What is the vision?  Who in the Hell is in charge of quality?  What made them decide to make such drastic changes overnight?  Why was there no narrative or rational explained behind this overhaul.  Valve just vomited this poorly designed, extremely buggy, modge podge of randomly designed and bloated features onto live servers.  Lets start with the map changes.  Why?  Why bounty runes?  Why relocaiton of rosh?  Why change core mechanics on a whim?  I tried multiple games to stack jungle camps and was maybe successful 5% of the time, trying at multiple iterations of early to mid 50 seconds.  Rosh is on the other side of the map...right in the middle of the river..o.O?  There are so many terrain changes now that I don't know how to ward properly and at this point in my time spent in the game...I don't want to relearn all of it.The minimap will be your demise.  Don't use it to flee frantically because the scaling is actually larger than the frame window and you will end up running face first into the enemy.  On that note, when trying to launch something across map  (like clockwerk's rocket) the actual trigger point is not in the center of the rectile, but the tip of the hidden mouse, which is the upper left hand of the bounding box.  Nice bug there, that went live???The pregame VS screen is atrocious.  Particles flying at your face to reveal the two battling team compositions...with horrific shadow flickering, polygon tearing, and half of the heroes are so poorly framed that their face isn't even seen!  What in the Hell is that all about?!  Did you have some unpaid intern work on this loading screen?Monkey King needs heavy tuning.  Not even going to get into that f*cking mess of a hero.  Dota 2 has not released a new hero that has never been released in Dota 1...until now...and its not even original or new.  Yea yeah yeah I know he's been in talks for like a decade or something, but he's not new.  He rolled out in League a long time ago and it just makes Valve look unoriginal and cliche.  Oh cool new hero!....its a monkey...how lame.  A monkey with an arcana, give me a f*cking break.Seriously, at some point were there 10 random people in a room throwing darts at a wall to design this patch?  Sadly, in 3 months from now..most of the bugs will still exist, new ones will be present, old features will still not be correctly implemented, and a year from now most of the stuff that was added in this patch will not be maintained properly and the game will be an even bigger mess than it is now.  But who cares right?  As long as people keep buying hats, pouring millions into overhyped tournaments, and fattening Gabe's wallet...why should they care?Pre 7.0 = 8/10Post 7.0 = 4/10Don't waste your time, money, or effort.  Go play a game designed by a team of people that have a vision and care about their product.  Or don't, who gives a sh*t. ",58,0,1,1,0,0,6
