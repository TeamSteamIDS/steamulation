												tl;dr a 21 map expansion for DOOM II with exclusive levels created by renowned mappers in the community, they're pretty fun and it's worth picking up. Tired of companies releasing shovelware CDs full of random WADs straight off idgames without giving iD a share of the revenue, iD contracted some of the best and most well known mappers in the DOOM community to make maps for iD's own official map pack.This resulted in the 1995 release Master Levels for DOOM II.The pack contains 20 single level wads (TEETH.WAD has a secret level, bringing the map count up to 21), almost an entire campaign worth of new levels.Master Levels comes with a text mode frontend called Doom-It for launching individual wads in the collection.Some parts of the original release were not included with the Digital version, such as Maximum Doom, which was a collection of 3201 random amateur maps downloaded off idgames. As you might expect these generally suffered in quality and had problems like some maps being DOOM 1 maps that were hastily ported to DOOM 2, which tended to break balance and cause additional problems. Some of the maps weren't even for DOOM but rather Heretic. However some of the maps were originally intended for Master Levels but didn't make it into the collection.Other parts that weren't included were a poster, and id STUFF, a bunch of encrypted software that could be unlocked via phone order.My thoughts on DOOM itself and the quality of the release here are the same as my other DOOM review.Overall the quality of the map pack is great. The extra levels are a lot of fun and freshen up the DOOM experience.A quick note, if you plan to play these using a modern ZDoom-compatible source port, check out Master Levels Menu Interface for ZDoom[zdoom.org] by Zippy, which is a replacement for Doom-It and allows you to launch the levels directly from the game.

												Basically some of the hardest levels you'll ever play. The title is not misleading at all. Even though some of the levels are no different than your run-of-the-mill Doom 2 levels, this map pack has its fair share of tricky dicky moments. The map Teeth is extremely difficult. Not for the noobs, that's for sure. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Master Levels for Doom II was ID Software's answer to the plethora of unauthorized level packs being sold for their popular game. Intent on outdoing the guys behind DZone, ID Software got some of the best amateur level designs to craft official levels as an expansion for Doom II. They also compiled over 1,800 WADs on a CD to give the DZone guys a run for their money.While those 1,800 levels aren't included, the 21 that make up the ""Master Levels"" are fairly good. Not every level is a winner (and some are just down right cruel), but it's a fairly competent collection of levels for anyone who has mastered the base game.The biggest issue is that ""Master Levels"" includes a lot of ridiculous enemy counts. Some levels have upwards of 250 enemies and keys hidden behind secrets. It creates an atmosphere where you can easily get lost or overwhelmed. A few times, I had no idea where to progress because my map didn't show anything else. I went to YouTube and found the answer to be obtuse beyond reason.That could also fit the description of how to find the hidden level (taking an invulnerability sphere and making an Arch-vile blast you). It turns what is normally a fun hunt into a frustrating exercise in patience. The AI isn't exactly smart in Doom, so trying to manipulate it in ways that it wasn't developed for just sucks.Then we get to how some levels are pathetically easy. A few of the WADs have spaced out battle zones that do little more than pad out the length of the level. If you constantly sprint (and why wouldn't you?), there doesn't really exist a reason to have such large landmasses.Sprinting is also key to finding a lot of items. A yellow key may be perched on what looks like an unreachable pedestal, but you really just need to travel a few rooms over and run like a wild man out the window. It's just annoying to see the same tricks repeated so many times.As for the Steam release, it's a bit of a mess. The game doesn't run any worse than Doom II or the other DOSBox ports, but it's strange to set up. There isn't a front loaded menu and trying to play them in any coherent order can be quite the ordeal. There are some extra mods for source ports that allow you to freely select each WAD (and the Eternity Engine has built-in support for Master Levels), but it's not as straight forward as launching ZDoom with the other main games.There is also no way to individually buy Master Levels on Steam. You have to get it in the Doom Classic Complete pack. While that is, admittedly, a good deal, it is a bit annoying. If you happened to only buy one of the main games or skipped out on, say, Final Doom, you're stuck rebuying them all.For that reason alone, I would say Master Levels for Doom II isn't worth it. The Doom enthusiast will already have the Complete collection on Steam, but casual users can just stick with Doom I and II.6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an expansion pack sold during the Steam Sales of 2014 when they first introduced ID's titles onto Steam, this is an extension which provides a much higher level of difficulty in newly designed levels/maps to try out in Doom 2.

												Whether the Master Levels are worth picking up or not depends on what you want them for: If you simply want high quality Doom II levels, you should probably pass them up. While there are some good maps in here, there are also poorly designed frustraiting ones. There are countless Doom maps available for free, and many are better than these:http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/What's great about this set of levels, however, is the history that comes with them. These aren't called the ""Master"" levels for nothing. The guys who made these maps were pretty much the best-of-the-best at the time of its release. If you care about the history of Doom mapping, definitely pick these up! It's unfortunate that they can't be bought separately or with a copy of Doom II, rather than having to buy all the classic Doom games in a collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Master Levels for Doom 2 does a good job of showing that you don't need to add any new content to make a good expansion. Either that or maybe an expansion for Doom 2 will always be good because even if it's subpar, you're still playing Doom 2. But Master Levels isn't subpar, far from it. The level design is top notch and extremely rememberable, and I was quite surprised that 3 or 4 of the levels actually had a plot! And an interesting one at that. For the majority of the levels you're just playing doomguy, but for these 3 to 4 levels, you play a cyberdemon thats actually been turned into a human! And sentenced to death, the cyberdemon fights back and ends with a finale against quite a few cyberdemons. This is easily one of the most impressive stories in a game that only uses .txt docs to explain everything! And by completing all the levels, I have been happily awarded the title of ""Master of Destruction!"" At least, according to the game... I highly reccomend everyone to play this and become a ""Master of Destruction"" too! And you should already have it, unless for some bizzare reason you don't own Doom Classic Complete. But why wouldn't you?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a collection of 21 (including one secret) custom levels for DOOM II made by the fan community and originally released in late 1995. Be warned: the quality and difficulty of the levels vary, and they're usually not up to the par set by the Doom community's best-known works. This is more of a snapshot of Doom history than anything, taking then-contemporary 'masters' of Doom level creation and showcasing their talent.The retail version of the Master Levels (as in the pre-Steam version) also contained 'Maximum Doom', about 1,830 amateur custom levels indiscriminately downloaded from the internet. It was iD's response to the shovelware discs containing thousands of Doom levels of extremely varying quality that were floating around at the time. You can read about it here[doom.wikia.com] and download it here[archive.org] if you really want to.The Steam version comes with a level select program running in DOSBox, but you also receive the individual map files themselves. I would recommend loading these in a sourceport such as Chocolate Doom or ZDoom for a significantly improved playing experience. If you're using a ZDoom program, you could also use this level selection map[www.doomworld.com]. Some of them don't start on MAP01, so you may have to use a cheat code or the aforementioned map to switch levels.Since you can only buy the Master Levels in a bundle with the other classic Doom games, I'd only really recommend this for Doom enthusiasts.Playing through each of the levels on Ultra-Violence, here's what I think of them in brief:ATTACK.WAD - a fun little jaunt by Tim Willits (a Strife level designer) through a Doom 2 style techbase in MAP01 style, except with tougher monsters.BLACKTWR.WAD - probably the best argument against playing these in alphabetical order. This one throws you straight into the deep end with lots of teleporting monsters, dangerous enclosed spaces and frankly frustrating progression. I will remind you that there is no shame in saving every once in a while on levels like these. Still pretty well-made and features notably tasteful usage of Hell marble textures.BLOODSEA.WAD - another slightly less challenging level from the same creator of BLACKTWR, Sverre Kvernmo. Devious but not too unforgiving, with the exception of the end area. Not as visually striking as BLACKTWR.CANYON.WAD - another great MAP01 replacement by Willits. I'd say it's above ATTACK in terms of quality: it's bigger, badder and nicer-looking.CATWALK.WAD - appropriately named, this level has its moments but doesn't quite pack a punch altogether.COMBINE.WAD - punishing without feeling too frustrating, this night-sky techbase is a good challenge with interesting design.FISTULA.WAD - another fun and varied one with a surprise ending. Bit on the short side though.GARRISON.WAD - more frustrating than the last couple of levels, but still a solid entry.GERYON.WAD - another distinctive nighttime level bigger than the last several entries, and a satisfying experience overall, especially the secrets.MANOR.WAD - has some decent combat and great texturing/aesthetic layout, but perhaps a little too clever for its own good. I had to consult a walkthrough in order to figure out how to progress.MEPHISTO.WAD - perhaps the best argument against randomly selecting levels to play, at least if you pick this one first. Sverre decided to take the gloves off and prove he was serious about his difficult arena battles with lots of revenants and other projectile monsters, and a final boss fight that's actually impossible to win if you used all your rockets on the baddies that came before. It pulls the rug out from under you repeatedly, but it's oh so good to finally beat.MINOS.WAD - this one throws the unexpected at you as well, but is more even-handed about it. It's also one of the larger maps in the collection, which is nice. The techbase-ish look is fairly appealing here too.NESSUS.WAD - tricky but kind of fun, like the little brother of the previous level.PARADOX.WAD - nicely constructed (if a little plain) and challenging but fair.SUBSPACE.WAD - apart from the Doom 2 enemies, this wouldn't feel out of place in an E1 throwback WAD. It's certainly an interesting one.SUBTERRA.WAD - a frustrating but memorable trek in a brick underground.TEETH.WAD - Sverre saved the best for last apparently, judging by the powerful enemies in close quarters and ambush after ambush. Likely the hardest level in this entire collection. Also contains another (secret) level that flew under the radar.TTRAP.WAD - probably the second or third hardest level, after TEETH. Lot of tricks and traps here right out the gate, but with enough goodies to survive if you can manage to grab them. Pretty satisfying though.VESPERAS.WAD - kind of like NESSUS's meaner big brother.VIRGIL.WAD - kind of like NESSUS's weird but still cool cousin.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Master Levels for Doom II is actually rather a interesting game, though sadly it has no story plots as its only about maps to choose from. Anyways, your main objective is just to complete the map, whatever you choose. It is indeed challenging when playing on high difficulty, no doubt about it. Besides difficulty, theres more you can add in the additional option, such as no respawn, and others.Buy it if you are up for a challenge, its actually worth to buy. Though if you never experience Doom games, just stick with the original and Doom II, then if you are up for it then buy this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												!!Important note!! To have the best experience with the master levels, I highly recommend you download a source port called Zdoom and a launcher called ZDL. Using both Zdoom and ZDL you will be able to play the master levels without any compatibility issues. Zdoom provides loads of customization to the controls. With ZDL, you will be able to launch each wad.fil (level). The master levels come free with doom 2. What Like about the master levels. •	Some of the levels were really well designed and awesome to play, like Blacktower and TTrap. •	You can play the master levels with brutal doom and project brutality, which I highly recommend. What I disliked or was disappointed with •	Some of the levels weren’t very good, wasn’t keen on the level called teeth and the secret level that came with it. •	It’s a shame you have to launch each master level up individually. Would have been nice if the master levels were made into an episode, with a story behind it.•	The difficulty of the master levels is nothing compared to Plutonia. Conclusion If you have played final doom and still want more doom, then I recommend this. The game comes free with doom 2, so it’s worth a try. There are some very good levels. I highly recommend you play this game with brutal doom or project brutality.  65/100 Zdoomhttp://zdoom.org/DownloadBrutal doomhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doomZDL https://github.com/qbasicer/qzdl/releases/tag/v3.2.2.2-stable ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The ""Master Levels for DOOM II"" is an officially licensed, fan-made expansion (of sorts) for ""DOOM II"". It is a loose collection of .WAD files created by DOOM fans and hand-picked by the developers at id Software.The collection itself is a kind of hodgepodge with no real continuity between levels, and is navigated via a custom menu screen created specifically for the expansion. Most of the levels in here are great, many of which are devilishly hard or contain complex puzzles and intriguing design elements. There are, however, a few I found to be woefully short or overly simplistic. But frankly, by the end of this 20 .WAD phantasmagoria of evil, you'll be thankful to have had those brief reprieves.The only downside to the ""Master Levels"" is that the Steam release operates through a DOS Box emulation, so it looks and plays terribly. I recommend just running the .WAD files individually through a source port like “GZDOOM” and use the idclev## cheat code to jump around to the desired level. There are ways to have your own menu to navigate the .WADs more easily, but if you’re too lazy to make it work like me, then a simple .txt file to keep track of which levels you’ve mastered should suffice.

												I pretty recommend the game for those who would remember old-school FPS classics, but I am not close to suggesting the product being sold in Steam as much as that. The product being sold in Steam should be something like Doom95 or the adapted ones within Doom 3 BFG, not the MS-DOS version that you are able to play through DOSBox on today's modern computers on which Windows 7/8/8.1/10 runs. This case moves the game away from smoothly playable conditions. Also, a product like Doom95 would have served the feature of setting an external WAD file in an easier way. My review about this product is also true for the other earliest Doom games that can be found under the package called Doom Classic Complete.Anyway, let me repeat the introduction of my comment: I do recommend the game.

												This expansion for Doom II is only available through Doom Classic Complete, which I highly recommend. The Doom series was a popular series in the 90s and has had another game recently: Doom II. The expansion pack consists of 20 ""WADs"", with one WAD containing a secret level [the first screenshot on the store page]. Think of this as a bonus, as steam has yet to sell this separately. This game runs via the acclaimed emulator DOSBOX, and you will find a copy of the application in the Steam directory. You will be able to select WADs via the Doom-It interface, where you can select one of the 20 levels. The WADs are extremely well designed and my personal favourites are TEETH and MANOR. However, this game is certainly not for everyone.Try the Doom I shareware on DOSGames using DOSBox before you make a purchase. If you don't like the limitations from the original DOS version, you can copy the WADs into a source port's directory [such as ZDoom and PrBoomPlus] and you can play it from there. They introduce new High Definition graphics and add jumping and aiming abilities. I cannot give this a score as it is not identifiable as a standalone title; you will need Doom II to play this so that is why Steam doesn't sell it separately. Overall, this is a great modification for Doom II. If you want to use other mods on Doom 2, you will need to use this command on DOSBox Doom2.exe -file [Mod].wad.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
