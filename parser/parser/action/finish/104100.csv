												Inside a Star-Filled Sky is a game developed by the lone indie developer Jason Rohrer. Inside a Star-Filled Sky is exactly the type of game I'd expect to see win some kind of award at the IGF - but winning an award at the IGF doesn't necessarily mean it's a good game. Insidie a Star-Filled Sky is a novel concept and little more. The game itself is themes around the idea of recursion where you 'enter' power ups and enemies. While this is a nice idea it doesn't really impact the gameplay that much and each item you enter is effectively just the next room. I did appreciate the power up mechanics. You can collect up to 3 powerups and they can be combined in interesting ways to produce interesting effects. This fact alone, however, is not enough to merit a recommendation from me.As a product, the game is very unpolished and feels like a prototype - for example editing the controls involves manually editing a config file. There's also no sound effects to speak of, just some ambiance music. There are some nice ideas here but I don't feel the developer took time to flesh them out into a compelling gaming experience and instead delivered us a rough prototype.Score: 3.5/10			",509,60,3,44,29,0,78

												I actually think this is an absolutely brilliant concept, and wish somebody else attempted it. Unfortunately, as far as I know nobody else has.This could be a good game, but a few things are wrong:1) There is no point to playing the game, since things go infinitely backwards and forwards you might as well have never tried doing anything. There is no reward for continued play.2) Bullet patterns are mostly undodgable and relies on your health bar to tank hits. A lot of shmup games do this and they usually suck. You can do this thing where you enter an enemy to make them suck more if they're giving you trouble, but it takes so long it's not worth the time. (but then again there is no reward for continued play so do whatever you want)3) Some levels aren't even related to the thing they spawn from. This usually happens in powerups, where you get in real close and randomly some open area spawns out of a design. It would be much more impressive if you always could tell what you're inside, and sometimes you can- but most of the time the screen is too zoomed in or the level too irrelevant to tell.I bought this game when it was released and since then it's only gotten 60 reviews. That's a shame, because I wish that somebody would play this, get angry and go ""I could do better!!"" and make a great game out of the idea.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Interesting concept where you dive inner(or outer) from yourself, an enemy or power up in order to make the subject in question weaker, stronger or different in order to get to the ""next level"".Once you figure out the concept of the game... well, that's pretty much it. There is no story so going through each ""level"" is pretty much like playing in an arcade, where you are just going for the points. That's not a bad thing, but for me, I wish there was more.I still recommend the game due to the fact that it has a VERY unique gameplay system. If anything, this game is still worth the trip, even if it is just for a little while!			",568,261,10,108,49,3,151

												Perfect example of how NOT to use procedural generation: as the content of the entire game.  This is an unfinished program with no vision.  Your only purpose is to pilot around from randomly generated level to randomly generated level finding better upgrades so that you can kill the enemies in the way more easily.

												If you enjoy the concept of games as art than this could be for you. I find it to be one of those games I can get lost in for a few 15 minute sessions here and there. There are some points where it's either over the top difficult or because of the power ups you've achieved it's too easy but those moments in between are great fun.			",773,210,33,116,94,9,148

												If I was given a chance to refund a single game, it would be this. There is an interesting mechanic (diving into enemies, power-ups etc.) but its connection to the game is vague at best. Going into something feels nothing more than a “next level” button , thus making it easier to lose track of your progress, everything looks so similar, if not identical.			",119,21,2,20,4,1,22

												It's entertaining for all of five minutes, by which point it begins to feel like it has outlived its purpose. The gimmick is neat, but there's so little actual game here that it's not worth even a few bucks to give it a try. If you want a sense of infinity, go look up Space Engine or some such prodecural game with real scope- IaSFS just manages to feel claustrophobic, and since the entire premise is procedural generation, thoughtless.

												Inside a Star-Filled Sky is an extremely clever concept that doesn't ultimately end up going much of anywhere.The idea is that you're a symbol exploring a top-down universe, shooting at monsters and collecting powerups. The trick, though, is that everything is fractal; instead of grabbing a powerup you can shrink down inside it, and then shrink down inside an enemy inside of that, and so on. You have a procedurally-generated infinity to explore.Exploring is all there really is to it, though. As far as I've been able to tell there isn't any actual goal except to survive as long as possible and travel as far as possible.			",274,163,3,78,15,0,55

												This game is unmistakably a return to a time when video games were more raw, unfinished, and simple. That this game appears to have depth and complexity is itself an illusion. I can count on my fingers the number of new things you will encounter as you play through the levels. My first time, I went as low as level -40. I couldn't seem to figure it out and every time you die, you go down a level. But then I started over, and am currently stuck at around level 118. There is a room full of robots that shoot enough bullets to make a japanese top-down shooter choke, and so to get past it, I went ""inside"" one of the enemies to try and disable it's weapons through giving it weaker powerups. Instead, now I am trapped inside of it by more crazy robots.The way I got as far as I have was not actually through a whole lot of careful planning or picking the right items. Instead, I find that I progressed faster by running straight past or through things to the exit. Since when you die you automatically get one of your three ""power ups"" replaced with about 6 life points, you can burn through those and get to the exit. But, having done this, I am now not strong enough to proceed.			",118,65,0,27,19,0,26

												""What if you could enter an object in a level and find a level inside of it? What if you could enter an object in that level and find another level inside of that?"" is basically the entire point of this game, and the answer is just that it'd be a procedurally generated game like so many other indie games nowadays, but wrapped in an attempt to make some kind of fancy artistic point out of it.Honestly, it's exactly what it looks like, though frequently far more boring than the screenshots depict. The game is described as: an ""infinite, recursive, tactical shooter"". By infinite and recursive, the designer of course means procedurally generated, and by tactical it means you'll often be sitting behind a corner waiting for the one time you can dash out without instantly dying, or choosing to run away into a different level because discretion is the better part of valor. If you're expecting good top-down shooter mechanics, look elsewhere.The artistic point isn't worth $8, and while it managed to bamboozle me into buying the game, I have no idea how it confused reviewers like IGN's or GamePro's, who actually managed to play the game before writing their reviews. I hope.			",923,363,8,393,62,1,217

												I just don't get it.The game throws you violently into gameplay, with little explanation on what to do. There's no tutorial later on, you pretty much have to figure out everything by yourself.The game itself is very confusing if you don't know how it works. For my part, I still can't figure out what each thing does, or what the goal even is. The art is fine and pretty good actually, but there's nothing much more to it. What a pity!Unless you can reach out to the developer so he can explain what the hell you're supposed to do, then you might be better off not getting this game, or at least, not until it gets polished a little more!

												An amazing bullet hell shmup. A marvel of simple design using  complex concepts with  confident execution. Jason Rohrer finally makes a gamers game, without abandoning his lofty concepts of art in the framework of game design.I could go on about the procedurally generated levels and enemies, the over one hundred thousand bullet power up combos, the recursive progression through (into? out of?) levels and the emergent game play the arises from this mix. I could talk about the philisophical implications that these factors evoke. But I'm just going to leave it at this; It's a blast of a shmup that will give you infinite variety within the framework of its design.			",961,222,15,134,84,5,161

This would've been a better game if things like that were explained properly. Also, the stylish retro graphics do make up for some of the game, but it just isn't enough.

												A really fun, interesting game. It's based around the idea of infinity but as to not sound pretentious, I'll just say it manages to be thought provoking with very little. Thankfully, its also quite good as a game. The shooting is fun with a variety of different projectile types that can be combined for a ton of completly different combinations. It is a shmup so expect it to get hard quite fast.  There a few other cool systems. Can't get past a enemy? Dive inside it and give it mediocre weapons. There is much more to it then it seems at first. My only complaint is that the backgrounds get repetitive fast, which isn't the best thing when the game never ends.For the price your getting a really unique and fun shooter that could last you a very long time.

												You enter enemies to weaken them, powerups to improve them, yourself to fix your combos... recursively!			",332,105,18,48,49,2,99

												This is a fun little game to just relax with for a while. Not much meat on the bones, but worth it over time			",222,31,4,27,11,1,19

												Recursive, funny, cute, harcore, bullet hell combined with mind faxing mechanics, only meant to be played for an eternity.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great, the idea is superb and the gameplay is excellent. You can go inside of things like enemies to modify them and come out to find that the enemy is something completely different. Imagine directly modifying powerups by going inside of them, then coming out to collect it. The idea is amazing. The excution is great.Certainly Reccomended.			",66,17,0,5,13,2,7

												I wouldn't call this game a hard tactical shmup as it's on the level of an easier Realm of a Mad God. Anything can become the stage as you can enter another level by hopping into the up arrow tile/manually enter a powerup on the ground/enter enemies or hell even your ownself. A good game to pass the time but I wouldn't call it a difficult shmup.			",343,62,0,39,13,3,23
