												Death to Spies: Moment of Truth is a WWII-era stealth game in which you play as a Russian agent named Semion Strogov, a man tasked with eliminating espionage-related threats to the Soviet Union. The missions that you must accomplish range anywhere from gathering intel to assassination, with the locations in which you will be inserted range from German military camps to an English hospital. The areas are varied, and you never feel like the developers ran out of ideas. The gameplay of Death to Spies is very similar to the Hitman games, with most of the stealth revolving around disguises. While crawling through bushes and vents are a viable way to play the game, using the game's disguise system is the most reliable way to play. The disguise system in this game is usually pretty realistic, and the AI is consistent when it comes to detecting you (I'm looking at you, Hitman 2 Japan levels), so you always know why your disguise did not work, and what you can do to improve it. Certain disguises don't work in certain areas, and if you take the clothes of a high-ranking officer, the guards will recognize that you aren't the person you claim to be. Adding to that, in the higher difficulty settings, blood-stained clothes and clothes with bullet holes are unusable, so stabbing and shooting is a no-no. Much more reliable weapons are the garrotte and chloroform if you prefer a non-lethal approach. The game doesn't seem to punish you for taking the lethal approach (as long as you are merciful to civilians), unlike many other stealth games out there. I can't speak much for the graphics of the game, since it doesn't seem to like my graphics card, washing out all the colors. This made the game look like an old movie, which in my opinion added to the atmosphere. The animations are nothing special, but they do their job and you can always tell what's going on. The music was mostly forgettable, but it always fits what's going on. One thing I did not mention earlier is that this game is very difficult, and the poor shooting mechanics don't do anything to help it. Unfortunately, there's no tutorial in this game, so some of the more nuanced parts of the game must be learned through experience. I personally enjoy when games give me a challenge and didn't mind the lack of a tutorial that much. As for the shooting mechanics, this is a stealth game, so you shouldn't be shooting much anways. This game really shines when you're walking down the corridor of a German military base, doing your best to remain inconspicuous. The thing that really sets this game apart from other games in this genre, and indeed, from other games period, is the amount of realism in this game. As I said earlier, if you stab people or shoot people, it renders their disguise useless, and people may recognize you if you take a unique disguise anyways. One of the options in the game is to make everyone speak their native language, adding to the atmosphere. Being a German speaker really helped me here, as most of the enemies in this game are German, and certain small hints can be drawn from their chatter. Strogov himself is, obviously, a Russian speaker, making all of the briefings and cutscenes in Russian with English subtitles. Death to Spies itself was a Soviet anti-espionage program during WWII, which I did not know originally. Overall, I really enjoyed Death to Spies: Moment of Truth. People calling it a rip-off of Hitman obviously didn't see the game for what it is: a realistic spy game set during WWII. A disguise system and assassination missions don't make a game a Hitman clone. Though the story is mostly nonexistent, and the game's soundtrack is mostly forgettable, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth is a fun stealth game that, as long as they iron out some of the wrinkles in (hopefully) future installments, could become one of my favorite games. This game is a definite recommendation, as long as you don't mind a difficult game.			",106,10,0,12,3,0,6

												If you like the Hitman series, have an interest in espionage or WW2 this game is for you. It is a bit dated now, and you can see this by the graphics and the UI however that doesn't harm the game in anyway as even now it is very playable. WEAPONSThe first reason I liked this game was the detail in terms of authenticity and gameplay. There is a large amount of historically accurate 'spy' weapons availiable including a Nagant silenced revolver and the classic silenced sten gun however if you are looking for a shooter this is not for you. Most of the weapons feel fairly weak - mostly because they are silenced but even the machine guns feel a bit 'odd' for example the STG 44 doesn't sound right and doesn't give a real kickback it should do, by affecting you physically, it instead just seems to tilt up when you fire. The guns are hardly the main meat of the game but for an authentic game such as this they could have done better.VEHICLES!Moving onto a positive note there are vehicles in the game, and correct me if i am wrong, but i do not think hitman or any other simular stealth games include the ability to drive vehicles whilst useing them as a tool to hide bodies or escape. Sure they don't drive very well but it is not a racing game and they are slow, but it is nice to have the option to hide a german officers corpse in the back of your bad♥♥♥♥♥opel blitz.AIThe AI is competant at what it does, the detection system is good - the sense bullet noises, if you are near them or in their line of sight and yet still allows you to use morphine or take out a guard from behind. There is always problems though-AI can be a bit stupid sometimes by repeatably charging into a room you are camping in whilst you gun 20 of them down, you cannot just walse through missions like this though as in the end they will pull back and wait for you, or 'lob' a grenade into your hiding spot.  STEALTH/TOOLSThe main component of any game of this genre is stealth i.e the ability to have to avoid, usually enemies, without being noticed. In Death to Spies moment of truth there is a variet of ways to do this...You can go in quiet using morphine, silenced weapons, diversions and patience to outwit the enemy or you can play it on easy and run-and-gun, but the latter doesn't work often and why would you want to anyway? The stealth is statisfying but you don't have the ability to do much in the way of interesting tactics. The interactions you are given throughout missions are good but they can be hard to find sometime, I spent ages trying to work out how to get passed a party of german officers only to find that the plumbing had to the solution.Good points:-A Completely solid game, I have had no problems with running it and the aesthetic and the gameplay complement each other perfectly (although the art direction is nothing to write home about- but the normal 'trying for realism' graphics suite it well).- Authentic levels, objectives, weapons, uniform (there is disguises in the game).-Up to you in how you complete the mission, big level design with choices of which way to go and what you do and (I think) sometimes even say.Bad points:-Lack of direction, doesn't really tell you the options you have to complete missions, and figuring it out as you go along on harder difficulties ends in death.-Boring mission objectives (Blow A up, kill B officer, find C secret documents - very cliche)-Bad gunplayOverall I had some fun with it, I would recommend it if you are remotely interested in this period of history (late WW2, early cold war), stealth games or simply a challenge (saboteur mode is hard - no disguises).If you would like to learn more about this game message me on steam or if you have any possible ideas or improvements I could make to my reviews also message me.

												Death to Spies: Moment of Truth is probably my favorite stealth game, next to Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory and Hitman: Blood Money.Every level is incredibly unique among the seven few that there are, but the game gives you just enough tools and varied enough difficulty levels (the difference between the hard difficulty and the hardest difficulty is alone practically two seperate games) that the lack of quantity barely effects the game.Tossable, infinite distractions, with more limited more focused variants. Whistling to distract. Three stances with two movement speeds between them. Usable vehicles (with usable horns.)Accident systems.At least one level with a straight up logistics puzzle.Oh, and really solid, clockwork inspired music.Most impressively, easy difficulty has more spaced out patrols and scripted lures that don't exist on other difficulties, ensuring that even novices have more than a fair chance to understand the workings of the game.This isn't for people who want a story with their game. Frankly, this isn't for people who want anything but a raw, enjoyable set of levels that end up being fun to play through.The animations aren't the best, nor is the plot anything amazing, and the combat AI isn't fantastic. That said, if you're picking this up the odds are you're not looking for any of those things.If you like stealth for stealth's sake, this is easily one of the best games you can pick up on Steam.It's the expansion pack Hitman: Blood Money never got, and you owe it to yourself to pick it up.

												Russian, WWII-era Hitman.  I didn't really even know anyone had ever attempted to do something like Hitman. And what a brilliant mix, a Hitman game about killing Nazis!Okay, so first off, this game ran fine (Windows 7 x64 still), in widescreen at good resolution without any effort on my part whatsoever, all I had to do was disable depth of field to get rid of some nasty textures.  You can't even get most Hitman games to run in widescreen without doing all sorta funky hacks, and again, its a Russian game, most Russian games I've played required serious effort to get running on any modern system.That outta the way. HOW DID I MISS THIS!?! I love the Hitman games, and this is arguably better than some of the old Hitmans, maybe even on par with Blood Money (maybe, I reserve judgement until I've finished the game).  I've never heard of Death to Spies until this sale, which really sucks because it does some things better than even Hitman does. For starters, if you shoot a dude anywhere but in the head, or if you slit his throat//stab him, the uniform he's wearing has bulletholes/blood stains, which are a dead-giveaway, so you can't use it.  Small, simple, brilliant. The objectives are a lot different, the primary focus isn't necessarily assassination like it is in Hitman, you're more of a spy than an assassin in many cases, you just have a license to kill and you USE IT =DSecond, this game rates your performance waaaayyyy differently, killing someone other than your designated target doesn't automatically bone you out of the highest ratings, its more about how professional, silent and clean you are. Strangle a guard and hide the body - and containers to put bodies in are rare in this game, you just have to dump them somewhere out of the way - and you're golden; make a mess, have a body get found, or set off an alarm though and your score is obviously penalized like most stealth games.  If they find a naked body you've taken the uniform for, they start looking for intruders wearing that uniform, making it useless and lowering your score.  However, you have a backpack, and you can actually carry disguises with you, again something we've never seen from Hitman. You have to do more than wear the clothes though, if you're disguised as a Nazi soldier, you need to swap out Russian weaponry for German weaponry, found on bodies usually, or you can choose to start the mission with German guns in most/all cases. If they see you using Russian guns while posing as a German sentry, their suspicion of you raises very quickly. Additionally, your dude can go prone and crawl, which is really useful in open, outdoor sections without generous cover (not to mention making sniping a hell of a lot easier).You do have a non-lethal option, namely a bottle of chloroform that works similar to how it did in Hitman 2 though it has 5-10 uses and 1 use knocks out an enemy for the rest of the mission, whereas knockouts in H2 only lasted minutes. You can also just punch someone in the face, but its not as effective and is noisy. Also of note, you can actually drive vehicles in this game, which was never a thing in Hitman; its useful too since the maps are pretty big; you can even use a truck that has a canopy to hide a body and move it around. On the hardest difficulty, the ability to take disguises is removed entirely, which basically equates to some missions being impossible to get through without garroting a few patrols and guards, however you also get an automatic score boost, to rectify any loose ends you had to tie up.I'm excited for the third one, it originally failed a kickstarter I think, and its not the original developers or publishers, and its more of a spiritual successor than direct sequel since its a different main character and set in the Cold War, but they have something here, excited to see where they go with it --- ",207,57,3,25,35,0,22

												This is a very hard stealth game, but highly realistic and time consuming. If you require a good game which involves planning, thinking, observing and acting at the right moment this game is for you. You really need to play the first one before hand which is now really cheap and just as good! The first one has a boot camp which introduces you to the franchise and gives you all the basic controls. This one just throws you in to continue the story! It has driveable vehicles, many weapons and objects to use at your disposal. You can use, steal and loot enemy weapons, uniforms (and get away with wearing them) and the enemy are none the wiser unless you pass  SS personelle or an Wehrmacht officer. This is a modern version of ""Hidden and Dangerous"" series which is my all time favourite but no longer obtainable or playable on recent versions of Windows. You choose your weapons, kit, equipment and even a backpack to carry extra things to help such as wire cutters, explosives and compass/binoculars ect ect. Takes forever to play and even longer to complete but at the end it's deffinitely worth it! Replayability is good and each mission has hours of different approaches. It's not a run and gun (although you can do this if you choose) if you wish to survive minutes or create a party conga line of enemies in a bunker doorway. Personally I give this game a 9/10 purely because the concept is genius, but the 1 it missed out on was because they have not made another one which is disappointing! No DLC or future anouncements of further franchise expantions which is a shame but does not cull the name of these two little beauties which are Death to Spies and Death to Spies - Moment Of Truth. Go on....make a party conga line of Nazis in a submarine base....you know you want to ;-)			",62,33,0,7,6,2,14

												Ohhhoooo boy THIS GAME. After a couple of years I could finaly play it again, and it has aged well. Like a fine wine, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth is best enjoyed in short sips. Take your time with it and feel how its taste brings you into another world.Set in WW2 and the early days of the cold war, you play as a Russian spy and infiltrate German bases and camps. There are also 3 missions in the USA, the UK and a Soviet base (with a bunch of filthy traitors! hrrrng!). The levels (except for the USA level) are AMAZING. Even tough the ""objective zone"" isn't always that huge, you have the feeling that you could travel the whole world from your current location. Detailed bases and vehicles decorate a realistic, living world that  really sucks you into the game. There are tons of weapons, uniforms, driveable vehicles and many different ways to solve a problem. Tiny minus point is the German writting and speech in some of the levels, but this shouldn't bother anyone too much.			",148,17,3,11,7,1,34

												2x shorter and easier than its predecessor, you can cut through this game in 5-6 hours, as opposed to 12-13 hours for Death to Spies 1. It's a bit more graphically demanding. AI has decreased in quantity and increased in quality - there isn't that spamming of enemies and civvies on a tiny map that you got with DtS 1.The fewer AI require more ""fooling"" though - you won't get by with just dressing up as an officer. You will have to dress up as several different character types throughout each level (civvie, worker, butler, soldier, officer, scientist, cop, FBI agent) and have the relevant paperwork in order to be granted access to various sections of the map. The levels and challenges are much more unique, so you won't be doing the same thing over and over again, but instead complete different tasks each mission (reconnaissance, assassination, kidnapping, sabotage, counterintelligence, intel theft).Overall, DtS: MoT is a shorter, higher-quality version of DtS 1 and is definitely worth playing.

												Just about won this game so here is my review:TLDR: 10/10 Best Stealth game series on Steam right now.You have to be a lot more cunnnig than in most of the stealth games. This is very realistic. Unlike HITMAN there is no ""Body box"" near every kill. You have to actually find hiding spots.The strategy is the best part of this game. It lets you choose your equiptment! (or hit the button for a recommended loadout). So basically you are pretty much open to do whatever you want withthis game.Ways to kill in this game :*Total stealth. - Sneak up on them and Garrotte, or Chloriform them.  *Brutal Stealth. - Cut their throat, Beat them up with your fists, Hit them with countless blunt objects.*Non-Stealth. - Landmines, Booby trap bodies, Rig doors to explode, or set up countless ""scripted events"" to happen.*Stealth at a distance. Throw Knives. Throw Coffeecups, and otehr map objects. Use silenced guns (including silenced sniper rifles.)Lots of startout items!!PoisionFirst aidThrowing knifesGarotteChloriformlandminesGrenadesHuge selection of guns. Every mission has its own unique guns too it seems.The maps are really BIG when needed, You truly get an ""Open world"" feel to the missions. Windows are realistic too, you can see inside every building!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I understand that the fans of this game come through the few negative reviews from time to time and downvote the crud outta them, so despite the fact ""0 out of whatever"" people found this useful, i do implore you to read it before purchasing the game. Despite the negative review, let me make something clear, if you are a fan of the hitman series, specifically of the difficulty, then yes, you will like this game quite a bit. I, did not, because the things I do not like in hitman are more apparent in this game. Death to spies, moment of truth features you playing as a Russian spy as he goes on a series of missions during ww2. The gameplay is very reminiscent of hitman, but is much more difficult, going ""loud"" is next to impossible, and the puzzles offer even less freedom than Hitman. In Hitman, if you have played it, you know the game is more of a puzzler than a shooter. You have a few choices on how to go about a job, with a select few giving the best score (Usually goofy things like dropping a chandelier on someone) And it makes the games more of a cartoon than a serious assassination game. Death to spies builds on this. This Trial-and-error puzzle game gives you 3 ways to complete a mission that ""work"" and almost no choice in how you go about them. The game gives an aura of a demon trying to stop you from completing your objective, every hiding spot is patrolled at the very second you need to be in it. Im not talking realism, its literally like a demon is controlling the enemies and knows how to counter your every move. Every house has 30 windows and no back door, You can be seen through walls and doors if you are too close to them, etc. The game will give you hints on how to complete missions, but in a similar thread to hitman, some of these just do not work. ""It gave me poisoned cigarettes, so i should give them to the target!"" Nah, no opportunity ever presents itself for that, someone else gives him them. Wanna try killing that person, and hiding his body, in a room fulla windows, so you can try to give the baddie the cigs? Simply not gonna happen.This results in a very frustrating game of quicksaves and reloads instead of a tried and true spy game. No recon, no planning, no picking what time you enter the zone. Your recon is you getting killed 40 times trying tactics until something sticks. Disguises are more realistic, to be fair, than hitman. It makes sense that finding a diplomat in the sewer walking around would arouse more suspicion than a sewer worker in the sewer, but this too is tarnished by a total lack of guidance. You find clothes, you try them on, you are in a tanktop with pants, who are you? No idea, game wont tell you, so you walk outside the garage and get shredded by bullets, jokes on you, mechanics cant even leave the garage to take a♥♥♥♥♥♥ try again. At the end of the day, if you loved hitman for its intricate and frustrating puzzles, and its goofy ""Kill scene"" style, where every target needs to die in a weird way, then you will love this. This is a game for puzzle masochists, and they will love the crud out of it.But for people who want an honest spy game where you get to realistically go about a job and try to take on targets, this just is not the game you are looking for. This is a puzzle game of trial and error, a game similar to hitman in that you try the same thing 20 times hoping that by chance one of those times the game will bug out and you wont be seen by guard X who is in the perfect place, where he cant be shot, cant be moved, and never needs to leave.

												A Solid Stealth Game for only the Most Diehard Stealth FansDeath to Spies 2 is much like the original game nothing has been drastically changed, only minor tweaks, the game is still extremely hard and the focus is on disguising yourself as the enemy. There as several tweaks incuding the ability to carry a disguise in your backpack, the addition of yellow enemies whom get suspicious only if you get close. The biggest change is the disguise system where its more about getting the right disguise for the task as opposed to going straight for the officer disguise, for example in the second mission the officer disguise is good for the 3rd floor however in the shipyard most enemies are suspicious towards the officer. However most of the time getting the officer disguise will do the job. Some negatives about the game are its length, there are only seven missions, a lack of tutorial, leaving players confused and struggling unless they played the first game, there is a visiual filter that gives the game a sepia filter, which looks extremely ugly in my opinion however you can get rid of it by disabling depth of feild also vehicles are not well utilised, they can be used in 3 missions only and are not too useful.The biggest flaw was that the game didn't give you as much help as it should, sometimes I would get stuck and have to go to a guide to work out what to do. For example in one mission I needed to kick a bucket of water on my target to get him to a secluded location, however the bucket looked just like a normal prop and the map didn't highlight the location of the bucket leading to frustration. Overall if you liked the first game or enjoyed the brutal difficulty of Hitman 2 and Contracts you will enjoy this one, the game is just as unforgiving. Your freedom to choose how to acheive your objectives is less than the extent in hitman but more or less the same as the first game.  Pros:-Graphics are better.-You have some freedom to choose how to acheive your objectives.-Unique Disguise gameplay is excellent, this and hitman are the only games that utilise this feature effectively.Cons:-Can be confusing-Quite short-No Tutorial ",111,11,0,8,1,0,10

												I'm going to start this review with on statement that I believe to be true.If you like the Hitman series, you WILL like Death to Spies: Moment of TruthDeath to Spies is essentially a carbon copy of Hitman in a WW2 setting. A lot of the gameplay will be extremely familiar to you and you will enjoy it the same way you enjoyed Hitman. Hell, it's even got an ""A new life"" type of level where there's a house being guarded by the feds, and the game plays out like Hitman: Contracts, where you watch as Agnet 47 wakes up and then play through his memories of the missions that led up to this point.Death to Spies has all of that.If you haven't played Hitman, but you're interested in Death to Spies, the game basically works as a giant playground of strategic freedom. You enter the level, receive your objectives, and then the game stops holding your hand while you work out everything yourself. You choose what order you'll complete the objectives in, how many people you'll kill, and plant all kinds of traps to catch your enemy off guard.My main problems with this game is that the controls can be a little clunky at times, and that CTRL+S quicksaves, for some reason. F5 already does that, game. I don't need another control to do that for me.Other than that, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth, is an exciting extension of Hitman that I would definitely recommend to any stealth strategy fans.

												Just like hitman but instead of the modern time its the WWII time!! Coolest thing about this game is each uniform you find from the germans you are only able to get in certain places due to your rank of the soldiers uniform. For this being said you then would have to find a german officer uniform so you can get into restricted areas. Inventory system is well done and can carry backpacks to hold more items. You can also drive cars, trucks, and bikes. Using allie weapons can alarm the enemys if your in disguise. Lockpicking system is pretty cool.If your a steath person and enjoyed the hitman series, than this is the series for you!			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												You play a Soviet counter-intelligence officer during World War II and your job is to infiltrate the Nazis, steal secrets, kill certain individuals and help dismantle the enemy from the inside.I'm still in the process of playing this game and I love it.  It's incredibly difficult at times as the enemy AI is pretty smart and will recognize odd behavior (which can vary depending on which uniform you've disguised yourself in).  This is a game that takes stealthy undercover spy work very seriously. If you run-and-gun, you're as good as dead.The best part is that you're free to complete your objectives however you see fit!  Say there's a high ranking Nazi official you've got to assassinate.  Do you want to plant explosives on the runway so his plane explodes when he lands or do you want to impersonate an SS officer, get the official alone and stab him?  How about take him out from a distance with a sniper rifle?  Those options (and tons more) are available.			",662,188,39,135,265,10,198

												If you're into the Hitman style of stealth game, where you sneak around and disguise yourself, this is a pretty good attempt at the concept. You're a Soviet officer infiltrating Nazi bases, British codebreaker camps, etc, usually (but not always) to assassinate someone or to sabotage their government. It's not as visually impressive as the late Hitmans, but I think it's probably a lot more clever AI-wise.One notable feature is the option to play any mission with disguises turned off, but with silenced weapons -- this basically turns the game from Hitman to Metal Gear Solid and often forces you to approach levels completely differently (and usually with a much higher casualty count). Good stuff!			",565,260,11,121,74,5,145

												Like a Russian Hitman based in World War II, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth features some very rich and pleasing environments however it remains to be one of the most unforgiving stealth games I have ever played. The game requires a great deal of patience and sadly it does feel clunky and poorly designed at certain points. Certainly worth the money if it goes on sale.			",355,37,4,32,109,1,42

												More World War 2 action, Hitman style. Better than the first D2S, I thought.A must have for everyone who likes to sneak around, stab people, and steal their clothes.Downside is that both D2S games are a little short. I'm a paranoid, slow player in stealthy games. Took me less than 20 hours each. Still, they are non-linear stealth games, which makes them rare and valuable.9/10.

												The Russian studios have been putting out some good work lately, and the Death to Spies (""SMERSH"") really lives up.  It's a nice change in that it doesn't play like other stealth/espionage games.  The atmosphere is excellent, and the variation of environments and objectives ensure that things never get too stale.  It does force the player to work slowly and deliberately most of  the time, which makes the few frantic moments in gameplay all the more so.  A bit bi-polar in some respects- if you don't mind that sort of thing, by all means, try it out.Also- a there's a couple missions in the series that take place in the United States.  The American stereotypes are quite funny.			",94,26,1,11,3,0,2

												Let me lead off with this: This is an amazing stealth game HOWEVER, its almost required to play the prequel first as it comes with no tutorial, a story that almost certainly only makes sense with the last games context (i never paid much attention to the story) and the difficulty, while not being impossible, is certainly higher when you compare the difficulty of the first level of its prequel to its first level. So far, i have not noticed many improvements upon the first game, although ive only played the first level of it. so in short it feels like a really long dlc to the first game with a few small improvements, only one ive noticed has been a slightly different disguise mechanic than the last game.Edit: started paying attention to the story, makes no sense whatsoever even though ive played the prequel, also evidently they added random backpack searches which, while not particularly dangerous are stressful when you are carrying something such as top secret merchandise that you just stole.

Very good AI, gameplay, Beautiful & accurate atmosphere which has ambience of WWII and similar old times.

												Tips:Turn ON vertical syncTurn OFF depth of fieldIf new to the series, use a walkthrough for the first mission to get a hang of the game mechanics.A great hybrid of Hidden & Dangerous 2 and the Hitman series, though the shooting mechanics are a bit rough. Stealth is pretty much the only option throughout the game, so patience and trial & error are needed for each mission.Its difficulty and subtelty scratched an itch left by the Hitman series. It's still possible to beat missions that go sour, which adds some variety and spontaneity.			",53,11,3,7,8,2,15

In the beggining you get to chose with what guns are you going to do the missions ( you get to chose a vast variety of guns froms smg to sniper rifle , you get to chose your handguns , if you take or nor grenades , mines , smoke , knifes exc .. ) The mission themself are really interresiting and long their are about 4-6 objectives in the mission with bonus side-objective mission that help you complete an objective . Personnaly i really liked the fact that a the end of each mission you get your statistics of how good you where , if you where noisy or quiet , how much headshots you had , the time you spent on the mission exc ... All in All its an amazing stealth game that i recommend to everyone . I give it a 9 out of 10 only because the graphics aren't that good but it it doesen't ruin the game.But for the price of 10.99 $ it is worth every single penny.			",100,1,0,10,4,0,4

												This sequel drops you right where the first game ended. Agent 47's Russian uncle goes through a PTSD-like dream which conjures up many of the deeds he has carried out as a SMERSH agent. Making the lack of emotion emanating from Hitman's colder-blooded protagonist all the more understandable, for continuity's sake that is...On a more serious note, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth features better graphics, slightly more comfortable gameplay mechanics, and manages to become immersive up to a certain extent (both environment and soundtrack-wise). Nazi imagery isn't ridiculously censored anymore, and although this isn't of the utmost importance, it still constitutes a little plus in my book. Oh and you can also switch the voice-acting to its' original Russian version.The only downside I can think of is the length of this game. Which is considerably shorter than the first outing. Needless to say, you'll still waste plenty of time looking for this-or-that oddity which may (or may not) confer a tremendous advantage over your prey. You get a fair variety of locations and situations.All in all, I enjoyed this game much more than the former, more rugged Death to Spies. I'd highly recommend this game for those of you who are unhappy with the course the Hitman franchise has taken, you'll possibly find solace in this gem.			",54,10,0,6,7,0,13

												Simply put this game is sorta like Hitman: Blood Money in a WWII setting. This game is hard. It requires real stealth. I love the fact the the 3rd Reich symbols aren't censored. The level design is nice with interesting subject matter. The disguise system is great. You get to choose from many different items to take on a mission during your briefing. Briefings are quite complex just as your missions are. A single level can take quite a long time. I'm really looking forward to the 3rd one. I supported the kickstarter and saw it fail. It's such a great series and hardly anyone knows about it. Must be a marketing/pr issue :( Anyways, if you like stealth games buy this!!! If you like WWII themes, weapons and vehicles (that are drivable) buy this!			",95,20,1,3,23,0,14

The term refers to the time of receipt from the tackled agent information, contributing to capture the entire searched the group and complete the operation. Interestingly, in the game, this never happens. For all passing we never capture an enemy agent. Success is achieved only by the information that our hero got personally, and his action. So not very clear why the developers have taken this name.Igor Cavalov has the Callsign ""Ramsay"".

												The game is old and its controls are clunky to say the least, but it delivers an espionage experience that is more about what a normal human can do (sorry Sam Fisher, you are too good to be normal).  Yes, the cut scenes have nothing to do with the missions at all, but I think they can be ignored as irrelevant to gameplay.  The tricky controls make gameplay challenging, since you can't just go around beating up everybody with your fists.  Each mission has multiple ways of completing the objectives (although there are inumerable ways to not succeed) and that gives it replayability.Of course you might just have fun challenging yourself to improperly play the game and figure out how to kill all the Nazis on the map.  That is fun too, and is worth the price.			",71,3,1,8,23,0,21

												*NOTE - This review is for the hardest difficulty, ""Saboteur Mode,"" which makes playthroughs completely different and much harder and stealthier than the lower difficulty levels.*  Like Metal Gear Solid, but not so much your gameplay being interrupted every 10 minutes by Codec chatter and / or Hollywood-esque cutscenes? Prefer gritty, hardcore, super realistic tactical espionage action where getting caught usually results in you on the losing end of a very short firefight? Well, perhaps you've stumbled upon this diamond in the rough as I have. The game plays similar in some ways to the MGS series with many elements from MGS3 Snake Eater (backpack, etc); mini map with enemies and their field of vision represented by a much larger cone than in MGS, FOV cones shrink when you go prone and stop moving for a few seconds. It grows even tinier if you are in grass and can utilize your camo. There is so much more into figuring out how to beat this game on hardest difficulty as you cannot procure enemy disguises. It's doable though, a trail well hidden / disposed of, garrotted, and chloroformed bodies later and I was damn proud of myself for infiltrating that Nazi airbase near Prague and putting a stop to the prototype Nazi Me-163 new rocket type fighter on the first mission!

												Ah! the satisfaction of seeing all the red arrows on the map turn green when you take down the highest ranking officer and get his uniform! Way better than the first game, better controls lesser bugs and better graphics. Like all the reviews says, this Hitman WW2 2.0 is criminally underrated.			",397,146,8,52,27,4,73

												The hardest stealth game ever made (Not the best designed mind you) unintentionally that answers the age old question of what would happen if MGS 2/3, a rip off of Hitman: Blood Money and Arma had sex and also NO POLISH? You play as a peice of toilet paper (With as much personality as wood) that can be killed by anything anytime in any way by enemies who are dumb as bricks but have MASSIVE vision cones if you aren't crawling. He only has enough strength to pull the trigger everything else he ♥♥♥♥s up or will get killed by even though your enemies take bullets like bran flakes and will show you why Germany considered themselves the master race in WW2 in terms of bullet proof ness.He must be famous because everybody knows who he is even when he's disguised and everybody hates him as if he were Kayne West opening fire from miles away as if you were playing Far Cry. Opening doors is a death sentence and if you dare try to use the restroom there will be consequences. I reccomend dropping any explosives on your person the moment you have control because 90% of the time that you get shot they will be hit and will explode. 6/10 buy and try before you  ♥♥♥♥ing die.

												Think a 3rd Person 'Commandos' crossed with 'Hitman' and you're along to the way to understanding what this game is about.It's hard hard, be prepared for a challenge.Only real downside to this game is lack of multiplayer, that's me coming from playing Commandos multiplayer with friends and family.

												Death to Spies: Moment of Truth is a spy infiltration stealth action game, similar to hitman, released in 2009 on steam. A sequel of Death to Spies.It has better graphics and a more fluent gameplay compared to Death to Spies. Except for the weird tree graphics that look distorted.It's situated in world war 2, intel gathering, capturing targets, assassinating targets, rescuing targets, destroying targets, etc. Comparing to hitman, it's more punishing leaving no room for error. Each mission takes roughly 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on your playstyle, once you mess up, you/re back to the start. It's very realistic in terms of reaction of AI etc, delay in shooting etc.There're 2 main issues I find, exactly the same as Death to Spies, getting stuck in places but you can still try to squirm out and hard to gauge the grenade throwing. Other than those 2, it's a pretty decent game for a 2009 release.Other than the stated, treat it as a world war 2 hitman game. You will need to run it in windows xp service pack 3 compatibility.It's totally worth the price at the moment, it does not contain a tutorial, unlike Death to Spies, so I do recommend getting Death to Spies: Gold bundle during a sale due to the age of the games.Death to Spies: Gold bundle contains both Death to Spies and Death to Spies: Moment of Truth.

												ReviewTo do very well in the infiltration field you need 2 at least elements: a solid AI and an authentic atmosphere. Let's say that the first one isn't a total success as the Ai acts like robots more than human. The AI have fixed patrol routes, they tend to be very passive and predictable. So I was often disappointed but at least it does not ruin the gameplay because the AI isn't broken at least. on the other hand the level of details that the developers put in this game is just amazing: radio music propaganda, authentic uniforms, portrait of Stalin / hitler , weapons, vehicles, even building. Those all together really makes you feel like spy in enemy territory.Conclusion : There isn't much to say. It is a good game but nothing more. Some people will certainly hate death to spy for its lack of funding and because it is very retro in many ways. The others will very appreciate that game for its design and atmosphere.6.5/10Worth a buy during sales ",57,6,0,8,10,0,8

												Death to spies -Moment of truth (..or D.T.S 2)  is very similar to the first Death of spies, with some slight improvement of the graphics, as well as even better designed levels too ! -First,I do really NOT think that this is a kind of game for everyone..This game must be among one of the hardest stealth-games  ever made ,..just like Hitman, just maaybe harder?..LOLit`s key to succed the missions is about timed moves, being patient before you pick the right time to ""strike""..but it`s sick how rewarding it is when you succeed  Things to do:  -Infiltrate bases, track and kill spesific enemy officers, find top secret documents,,Kill enemy-guards without being discovered, hide their bodies, steal their clothes for your own disguise.If you like a spy/stealth WW2 game with excellent/maximum challenge, This must really be it ! :)			",129,27,0,1,0,0,0

												A pretty underrated game. The original Death of Spies was just amazing as well. Before Dishonored, before Hitman and the hiding of bodies, stealing of clothes was Death To Spies. It did it first and did it well.  WWII setting for a stealth game, and its a great one. Still one of my original favorites.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Note: This is a copy-paste of my review for the original ""Death to Spies"" review, as I have nothing else to add. Personal rating: 6/10replayability: LowBudget: If you liked similar games, buy it on sale. Lenght: Probably a week at least. Death to Spies is actually a good game. It's just old. I first played this game as a kid, coming back to it many years later was  a weird experience. I admit, I really find the game entertaining and challenging, but the game has bugs and a degree of randomness that can be unforgiving at times. It's also so old and primitive that many obvious options that were the stuff of dreams back then, but is quite ordinary in games now, feels like are missing. Over-all, this game is for people who like games like Hidden & Dangerous and other stealth-based games where you have a big map and an assignment to completel. Pretty straight forward. Unlike titles like Hidden & Dangerous, this title doesn't really feature co-op.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can not recommend this game - not at all. I know it's a old game so I won't complain about the graphics, in fact it looks reasonable for it's age I guess. BUT .... the controls, the gameplay, everything is so finicky, buggy and laggy..it's actually hard to do anything else than moving. The gameplay is just...it doesn't work and it's no fun.The concept of the game is basically a WWII Hitman, which I would have LOVED if it succeeded, unfortonately - it didn't.I do not want to step on any toes, but this game left a bad taste in my mouth and was the very first game on Steam that I regret buying.3/10			",86,15,11,15,17,1,17

												I‘ve played this game and the previous one a few years ago when they hit the market. Since I love stealth game, this game is just right for my taste. It's pretty much like the Hit-man series but in  the war time. Enemie's AI is good even on easy level, so a low profile is always recommend, you are supposed to finish the job by changing uniforms, which means you are a ghost without anyone's notice. Like what I said, you are pretty much like agent 47.Though I had few glitches, happens when you stuck in the corner of wall, and sometimes guards raise alarm long after you take care of someone. But overall this game is awesome,it is quite like Hitman but not all. First you get the important point marked on your map.So instead of wondering around thinking where to start with, you have some hint so you will not lost. (Though the map usually is big and it's interesting to investigate most of the places) Also when you successfully changed your uniform,which means your identity, other guys will not notice you so don't worry someone else in the same uniform will blow you away. Likewise usually you have more than one way to get your job done, walking or driving, just remember to find the right angel make sure your enemy does not see you.However, like the latest Hitman game Absolution, the rating system is flawed. I shot my suppressed pistol to break a window so I could get in, but actually this lowers my grade since I made noise. ( Feel like I should get the highest rank but fails somehow everytime lol.)I know the team is creating a third game of Death to Spies, and after I tried the Demo which contains the first mission. I'd say I'm really looking forward and I'm glad to see the game feels the same but goes more smoothly. Great job,120% recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really want to like this game, as it seems like a WW2 version of Hitman Blood money, but there are just a lot of 'bad' things, firstly there is absolutely no intro to the game, now cutscene? yes, but NOTHING in the way to explain the controls or how to use the systems (ie melee, lockpicking, the minimap, basic motion, the detection system, etc..) so you really just have to fumble around. Secondly the animations and models are pretty choppy. Granted this is a few years old, many less ambitious games have looked nicer in motion before and since it's release. Overall I don't think this game is good to play unless you've played the first one (which I hope tought the players how to play) as it's not a very welcoming game to newcomers			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After reading posotive reviews, and considering the game was on sale for 2$, I decided to buy it. No its not worth 2$, im not even sure how this is fun. First of all this game has the worst controls in a game I have ever played. It has no tutorial and lets you find out your controls by rebinding all of them and seeing what they do for yourself. Its locked in a terrible third person and the animations are awful.OK but sure once you get past the terrible controls and graphics the game is pretty good right? No. I set this game on the second hardest difficulty and i'm not really sure what to say. You spawn in the woods with a guy on his knees by what I assume is a radio transmitter. You can see two german guys standing by a truck that im failry certain is a cube with one edge lower on the front end and a transparent recantgle for a window. If you sneak over to them and pull out your silenced pistol you can't even shoot them until you get within 5 feet or so because a red x appears over them if you aim at them. I took out my ppsh and expereinced the worst recoil in a game i have ever seen. After shooting 3-4 bullets your gun is effectively pointing at the sky, that is no exageration. You cant shoot beyond 3 bullets at a time. So now the two german guys know Im here trying to kill them. One crouches and starts strafing to the side extremely slowly while shooting at me with a mp40. He misses, and while he is doing that the other guy runs in zig zags toward the base because there is no ai pathfinding. I manage to kill the guy shooting at me after a full clip becuase it is not possible to aim. Then the alarm sounds becuase the other guy managed to zig zag his way back to the base and activate it.I decide to just go in guns blazing so I get in the VW or whatever they were standing by and start trying to drive. Its insanely bad driving but im not sure what i expected. The truck manages to hit a tree and I just get out only to be mowed down by 3 german guys.I try again where I instead just sneak towards the base and ignore the two guys in the woods, I go prone and crawl towards it but get spotted and end up running through the woods while nazis zig zag after me, then stop to shoot, realise i am out of range, get up again, and repeat the process. I never got past the first level, and im assuming it didnt get much better.Pros- You can choose your equipment before a mission I guessCons-Terrible Graphics-Terrible Gunplay-Terrible AI-No Tutorial-The difficulty system is basically centered around the limitations to putting on people youve killed clothes.-Im not sure how you stealth kill people in this game-????Conclusion - dont buy this game			",76,5,0,5,4,0,16
