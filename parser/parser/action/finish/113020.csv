												Alone, with friends or with complete strangers, monaco is by far one of the best coop games i've ever played. If you don't mind  feeling the adrenaline pumping to your brains the first few missions you're given, you'll find that Monaco: what's yours is mine is much deeper than just heists  organized by french pixelized criminals and cheesy french lines randomly tossed by guards emailing their parents about how they finally got a good job (not) chasing you. It's about not dying; it's about cleaning a level, to see how far you can go for a bunch of lousy coins. When you finally avoided all the lasers, the guards, the dogs, the chopper; when you've asserted your domination over the rich and glorious city-state of Monaco, all you got to do now is to play the levels again and again to ultimately clean out Identity without alarming the guards once.Allez mon vieux, t'as rien a faire ici!Now with Zombies, boobytraps and Bazookas:                                                               CERVEAU!

												Monaco truly is a game for anyone and everyone. It is simple enough to pick up and immediately understand how things work, while at the same time offers the complexity to have multiple players spend a few minutes sitting still, devising a self-titled ""Best Plan Ever"" complete with tracing the plan on the screen with fingers, saying “Ready? GO!”, only to see it backfire in seconds.The easy learning curve, the variety of characters, the sprawling levels, and the lovely sound and art all combine to make an extremely appealing and replayable game. Monaco offers a new and unique kind of chaotic co-op stealth gameplay, resulting in a work of indie art worth stealing.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												You know those games where everything is perfect? The music is awesome, the play feels great, there's a bunch of variety and it never gets old because every time you play a level again you try doing something different that changes the whole thing?Yeah, me neither. Or at least I didn't until I tried this game.The game revolves around... Well, it differs between levels. Sometimes you're making a heist, sometimes you're rescuing someone, and sometimes you're simply getting the f--k out of there.The game is well balanced with multiple characters, each with different pros and cons. One of my personal favorites, the pickpocket, has a little pet monkey that follows him and gets coins for him. See that coin just out of reach because you'd trigger an alarm to get it? Let monkey Hector get it.Then there's, say, the cleaner. See a guard blocking your way? He can just sneak up on him and put him to sleep with good ol' clorophorm.Then there's a locksmith, that, you guessed it, picks locks, safes, ATMs, everything twice to three times as fast as everyone else.Then there's a looko-- you get the point.The music also plays a part, mostly because it's 1- Dynamic and 2-Wonderful.Seriously, you can just see some of the music in this game by going in this link: http://austinwintory.bandcamp.com/album/monaco-gentlemans-private-collection-bundleThis music was made by the same guy who made the music to Journey. And we all know how wonderful that turned out.The game also has a full fledged workshop with a level editor that, while awkward at first, has literally every single thing in the actual game. See something in game? You can do it in the editor too. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's the same editor they used to make the levels in the game.But don't be fooled by it's cartoonish graphics, because under that pixelated looking exterior, is a whole story full of drama, plot twists, foreshadowing... And you can play the piano. Yes, that's right, you can play on a f--king piano. With friends. There's even an achievement for doing so.My point is, what are you doing still reading this? Seriously, this is a huge wall of text. Unless you skipped straight to the end. Either way, stop reading this, and go buy the game. Now. I want more friends to play with me, because, you know. The more the merrier!			",136,21,3,13,27,4,34

												Imagine if old GTA games, Chip's Challenge, and Oceans 11 all stumbled into a blender owned by a Lego man.Boy what a mess that would be. Thankfully, Monaco is 'not' a mess, but rather, a stealth heist game in which you and up to three other thieves band together to plunder the money of a variety of facilities in and around Monte Carlo, everything ranging from Casinos to Hospitals to High Security Prisons, being represented.The game's two virtues are its deceptive level of gameplay depth, and its humorous design aesthetic. It's the personality hidden behind the neon pixels that at first attracts one to this game--the perplexingly simple yet expressive character designs go along with the frantic piano ragtime and silly french NPC voices, to be extremely memorable. You'll laugh as your little colorful lego thief pees in a toilet, wiggles their hands to hack a PC hollywood style, or hugs a wall and takes deep, ragged breaths after being shot--to the accompaniment of bloodied footprints left in their step. And as your little Mr. Pink dies from that one guard who peaks just inside your hiding place to bop you with a wrench, they explode into a neon pink colored skeleton, and the music thuds to an abrupt halt--only for the music to pick up again where it left off, once your fellow criminals put your guts back in (to the sound of hilarious squishing noises).As for the gameplay, it's definitely the part that keeps you playing Monaco, long after you're familiar with its pretty pixel face. On the one hand, you can be a sneaky, super subtle player who never gets caught, never trips a trap, never fires a shot. It can at first be a difficult process to do so, as you're forced to learn by trial and error (due to the game's sparse tutorial elements) how to remain undetected.On the flip side, however, Monaco, unlike some of its compatriots in the sneak-em-up genre, never trips over the hurdle of forced stealth. You can shoot people down in a bloody Scarface-esque machinegun massacre, lure guards and civilians into side areas off patrol and give them a wrench over the head, 40's femme fatale style, or be a clever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, cut the circuit breaker in a particularly well-guarded facility, and just 'camp' the power room subduing guards who come with chloroform, while your (debatably) coordinated teammates do the legwork.In fact, if you're in a hurry, it can sometimes be better just to run aggressively past NPCs, dodging from cover to cover to avoid security agent machinegun fire, or to climb in a vent duct to escape angry attack dogs who are onto your scent, rather than trying to outstealth them. And as a result of this flexibility, at first, it seems like Monaco will be trivially easy to play and win. But Monaco is a stern teacher, and it knows how to steadily ramp up the difficulty to keep you challenged through around thirty-some different, replayable missions. As you go, new classes and items are introduced to the formula, along with new map features like security-trigger handscans, computer viruses, alarm-triggering ATMs that must be busted open for cash, and more. The game is incredibly flexible in its approach, and each class is nuanced enough to be distinct from its brethren. (The one class I am not personally fond of is the Pickpocket, which tends to encourage reckless, self-serving tactics over cooperation, at lower levels of play experience.) However, the classes are not so distinct that they cannot all perform basic functions like opening a safe, or hacking a PC--it's just that some classes do these things more efficiently than others. So there will rarely be a point where you play a mission 'exactly' the same as the last time you played it, as you tackle obstacles in a level best suited to whatever class you are playing at the time.Lastly, there 'is' a story to the game, consisting mostly of text dialogue, but which is filled with humor and an actually relatively intriguing plot, fleshing out the personalities and origins of the thieves you play as. The thieves themselves have some pretty charming tics--the Hacker is constantly making references to PC error codes and computer shorthand terminology, the Gentleman is your 'World's Most Interesting Man', complete with his own little intrigue and espionage plot, the Cleaner is a stoic psychopath who rarely speaks beyond deep heavy breaths, and the Mole has a terse Serbian accent and a Freedom Spoon which he employs with a mixture of bravado and thuggish loyalty.The game does suffer from a poor matchmaking system, which is a bit prone to lag and connectivity issues. Also, the menu options are a bit confusing, and there is one bug with using a controller that prevents mouse usage until your machine is restarted--so if you tend to use a controller for some games, like Gauntlet or Dark Souls, but prefer a mouse and keyboard for Monaco, you may run into complications where your mouse doesn't want to work to aim guns til you pull a soft reset on your OS.All in all, I give Monaco a thumbs up. There are a lot of visual tweaks that could probably make finding your way in the maps a bit easier, the story could use some accompanying visuals (even if just still scenes), and the tutorial aspects of the game are sorely lacking even after a custom tutorial map was added--but the game just has so much complexity and charm, that it's hard not to pick it up from time to time, if you can get past those hiccups long enough to get into the meat of the game.Grab it if you don't have it, and see if you can't wrangle some friends into the heist with you on headsets. At worst, it'll make for an amusing weekend of cartoon criminal hijinx.			",98,30,0,12,3,1,2

												Absolutely recommended. I originally got it with the Indie Mega Booth pack, since six games for $20 was a steal. I'd never heard of Monaco before that, and I fell in love almost right away. The soundtrack is great - all jazzy piano that changes intensity depending on if you're sneaking or being chased; the game itself is gorgeous, very colorful but not blinding; some levels can be difficult, but with persistence and planning you can get through it. 10/10 would recommend.

												A game of intrique, mystery and most importantly, teamwork. Monaco is a game that revolves around a gang of criminals who plan a series of heists to escape from jail, and to escape from the suspicion of the law. Throughout the course of the game, players will choose different and unique character classes (mole, locksmith, cleaner, hacker) who utilize special skills (digging through walls, opening safes, knocking people out, diasbling security systems) and a vast array of thieving tools ranging from shotguns to smokebombs in order to perform heists. The game features a unique top-down blueprint perspective that, when a good plan goes through, feels like a scene out of the Oceans 11 series. While the game on single player is enough, it's the multiplayer that truly makes this title worth a purchase. Local Co-op and Online Co-op (these are mutually exclusive in this case) let you have fun with friends and strangers, and friendly strangers around the world. That being said though, multiplayer is also one of the biggest caveats of the monaco experience. Servers can be unreliable at times and the leaderboards seldom update or never record scores, if it all. This can create some frustration since a really fun aspect of Monaco is planning routes and heists and seeing how these strategies stack up against other players. While this game is a personal favorite of mine, I recognize that this type of game isn't for everyone. Very often do I see others online who treat this game more like smash tv than splinter cell and the game punishes you heavily for just running in guns a blazin'. so if you're looking for a typical high speed shooter experience, this isn't going to be your thing.tl;dr This game is about stealing♥♥♥♥♥♥like nobody even knew they took a♥♥♥♥♥♥ You gotta get gud or go home.Pros:+Music is awesome and atmospheric+Gameplay is top notch+Online Multiplayer is enjoyable+Workshop Enabled+If you like games with a story that makes you think, this is greatCons:-Might not be for everybody, which will probably ruin your smooth heist experience-Online leaderboards don't update as often as they should-Servers can be kind of iffy at certain timesThis game is 9 vinegar husbands out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(This game was rated Overwhelmingly positive, I have no idea why it says mixed. Must be bug ;-;)This game is underrated. Very nice design and awesome game play. Never gets boring and is challenging no matter how good you are at the game, you will be learning new things about every time you play!WHY DIS GAME IS GOOD:HUGE REPLAY VALUE: There are 8 classes, many play styles, a workshop, 5 achievements for each level, multiplayer, and 2 game modes. Which makes a combination of 480 ways you can play each level. There are 50+ levels and workshop!!!CHALLENGING:No matter how many hours you have, you will always be learning new tricks and the game never gets boring.SIMPLE CONTROLS :If you want to, you can play this game with only your left hand, that is right! WASD and space bar! It’s so nicely designed and simple, easy to learn but hard to master.GREAT LEARNING CURVE: Perfect level designs, you will never feel like you are stuck on a level but each one is a challenge and a checkpoint to make sure you are ready for the next. None of the levels feel receptive and you learn something new after each level. Very nicely ordered.SOMEONE FOR EVERYONE: There are 8 classes and each has a very unique play style, so even on the same level you can have 8 different experiences when playing.CREATIVITY: You can make your own maps and there are tons of maps on the workshop for you to download. Getting bored of just heists? You can make race maps, death runs, PvP’s. It’s like it’s own g-mod.VERY NICE COMMUNITY: The community has some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. It’s kind of a small community so the older players are very nice and will try to help you in game if you have any questions.TAKE YOUR TIME: Rounds can be long or short depending on weather you go stealthy or do a speed run, so it fits everyone’s play style. If you need to leave soon and want to play something for 10 minutes, this is the game for you. If you want to play for an hour, or half a day, this is still the game for you ;)ADDICTING: You always feel you can play “one more round” and by the time you realize it’s already the next day….STEAM PLATFORM: Very nicely linked to STEAM.  Creating lobbies and inviting friends are super convenient as well as uploading your custom maps.DEVELOPMENT: Runs super smoothly, hardly any bugs. The devs are nice and they are working on a new game atm! Go check it out =w=HIT ON PEOPLE: Simple to add friends with a easy “view steam profile” button. GREAT SOUNDTRACK EDITING: Music is excellent! The rhythm even changes when you are being chased, giving you a clue weather its safe to run or not.EASY TO LEARN: Whole interface and character designs are very nicely done.NEVER GET ENOUGH OF MONACO:The map editor is very simple to pick up and after reading a guide or two you’ll be a pro map maker.GOOD FOR LAPTOPS: Small game file, barely takes up any space for laptop users like me. A game you can play in class or on the go ;)ZOMBIES OR NOT:There is a zombie mode if that’s your fetish ;)MULTIPLAYER: Everyone can only use one class, making you feel dedicated to your role. The maps are designed so you can wander off on your own but also be very useful as a group.WHY THE HECK ARE YOU READING THIS JUST BUY THE DARN GAME!!!IF THIS IS ON SALE AND YOU S T I L L  AREN’T BUYING THEN YOU’D BE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE!!!!! >:D just get it cause diamonds will make you feel better!!

												short, glib review: Benny Hill Skit Simulator 2013 (later patched to become the Superior Sociopath Simulator 2014)Let's be frank here, most of you have this from a Humble Bundle or 20 now. It's a good game, BUT, play it MP. Find a pal or three and co-op the campaign. Push through to the end of the first one* at least, it's around 18 stages. You'll get new thieves as time goes on, experiment, shake up who uses what if you're stuck. It's a great game in this context. Solo, though, it's kind of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥stealth title. I played half of the game alone and it involved more skulking than stealing.It's fun! It just requires pals to really bring out the true chaotic underbelly of the game as someone lingers a second too long and suddenly all the guards are rushing towards one corner of the manor and do you help that guy or do you jack everything you can in the meantime and maybe pick up his corpse later? No honor among thieves, you know.Enjoyed the hell out of it - stopped after campaign #1 because my group finally went ""Yeah, that's a good amount.""* There are 4. Do not let it be said this game didn't get post-release support, the final patch added an entirely new set of missions on top of two entirely redesigned game modes and a crazy amount of Workshop support.

												Greeetings all potential buyers of Monaco!Pull your chairs in, and listen to the sound of my voice:Monaco is a fantastic game. That's the first thing to keep in mind throughout this review. For an Indie game, I am suprised as to how polished and nice looking the game is, with no bugs that I have found or are aware of. The soundtrack is fantastic, and is one of the many things that keeps me coming back to this game. Another great thing about it, is that you can just jump into it and have some fun with it. There is not a lot of tutorial needed to know what you are doing in this game. It is more of a stealth game, than a shooter such as Hotline Miami. Another point that I want to go over, is the Co-Op mode. Although I do not have a lot of experience with this, from what I remember, it was great fun to see how you can help your friends out with completing a mission as fast as possible. You can look at the game as a casual indie game, but you can also get competitive and try for the leaderboards.This game has a lot of depth to it. It does very well at creating atmosphere for the player, and it is a lot of fun to just run around the area to not get spotted. Even though the storyline is a little bit thin, it is not the main selling point of this game. If you want a game that you can just jump in an play with for a good amount of time, and not get bored with it, I highly HIGHLY recommend this title!So go, run, get out your wallet and GET THIS GAME NOW! It has won a multitude of prizes from proffesionals, so don't take my word for it, try reading some other (more proffesional) reviews online, to get convinced of how amazing this game is!

												This is a well built stealth game, a game genre we are lacking in quality.You have your choice of several characters, each with unique abilities and unique styles to play through the maps.What this game offers is more variability of gameplay. If you're spotted or set off an alarm, you have options. You can try gunning down the enemies, running around corners, sneaking behind a nearby bush or running for a vent. It takes time to get through them though, time the enemy can pummel or shoot you. Unlike other stealth games, a well planned out escape won't necessarily lead to death if you're clever.The difficulty curve is really well done. You're consistently unlocking new content and styles of gameplay with every level, the challenge slowly increasing. If you die, it doesn't feel like such a failure compared to other games because you learn. I actually found it fun to die. While playing co-op, death adds an extra layer of difficulty of: How do I get my teammate back up?The in game dialogue is clever and cheeky. There is strong depth of gameplay here. I even like the basic 2d graphics, it feels uncluttered and consistent compared to other games. The smaller and quality nature of the maps make the game forgiving of failure.The bad would be finding enough people to play the later levels with, the few co-op games that lag, and dying on the later levels after an arduous journey through four levels.I highly recommend the game. I give it a solid 8.5.			",288,152,5,54,30,3,49

This should be on the steam MUST-HAVE pack. For such a fun indie game I wouldn't be surprised if we saw this title on ios sometime soon. I do not know about IPod but IPad will be in the APP store soon.- 9.63/10			",47,6,0,1,5,0,3

												I've a strange relation with Monaco. And a strange tale to tell.When the game came out, I didn't believe in it. I was very interested by the concept, but really put out by the graphisms. You see, I hate this game of ""faux retro"" graphic style a lot of people use nowdays to surf on the wave of nostalgia, especially when they could totally make games look better using their technology and talent. So the game at first was no more than a missed opportunity to me.Enter Kotton, a friend of mine, who told me I should really give the game a try. I wasn't convinced. So, as he often does to try to force my hand, he gifted it to me. Game was small, I decided to download it and give it a try.And oh boy, what a gem did I found. Let me get things straight: I WAS WRONG. So very very wrong.Monaco is an awesome game with a very strong ambiance, the graphic style has its own strange blocky charm. It takes a while to get used to it gameplay-wise, but when you do, it's all smooth sailing.The gameplay is extremly solid. Everything happens for a reason and by knowing how things work, you can make the better of them. There is only a limited amount of RNG.The scenario is interesting and to the casual player, Monaco has the big advantage of being extremly funny when things go wrong, turning into a Benny Hill comedy with guards chasing the characters around in a total chaos while the alarms are blaring and everyone tries to scramble for a good hiding spot. To the more result-focused player, the game is also interesting, with a scoring system dependant of both efficiency and speed, a strong speedrunning community, and some pretty challenging maps to boot.Every character has its own specificities, meaning multiplayer is always a treat(in good or bad), and allow a great amount of teamplay.I ended up loving this game so much I gifted it in turn to something else, hoping to share the love, and retablishing balance in the world, as an apology to not believing in it to begin with.Don't exactly expect a top view shooter though, this is not what Monaco is. Monaco is a pure stealth game, and a solid one at that. It does have some shooting, but to a limited extent, and to be used strategically. If you can get it during a sale, you will probably pay it something like 2 euros or so, and at that price, it's pretty much... A steal.			",184,8,0,25,12,1,30

												Pretty amazing game all things considered. It's been around for a year now, so the price is lower than release, and I'm sure you can get it for next to nothing from either a Humble Bundle, or waiting on a Steam sale.As you can see from previews, it's a top down sneaking/stealing game. You've got eight characters total, each with their own main ability, and a less noticeable side ability. Example, if going by the preview, the Lookout is the expert at Recon, which means when she's sneaking/stationary, everyone gets red icons on the map indicating where guards/civilians are, even when not in vision.Her secondary power is that she opens ladders/vents 3 times as fast as anyone else. The main power of each class is the draw, but often you'll find the secondary power is incredibly useful as well.There are a rich amount of stories, though given that this game is a year old now, online co-op can be somewhat hit or miss. There are still players, but you might not be able to get a game every time you look. Another frustration is that later missions become really very difficult for a solo player to beat. It's always completely possible, though sometimes it requires some extra work. This really is a game that benefits from co-op.As people have mentioned, getting seen or alerting guards will not be the end of you, and in fact is required sometimes to move guards out of position. That said, later missions in say the 2nd story or the epilogue will punish you quickly for not being stealthy. Finally, for a small little indie title about pixilated thieves, there is actually a pretty good story being told here. It presents itself as story's being told by one of the thieves in a police interview. As such, the 2nd story is the same heists, but completely changed around, and a step up in difficulty as it's another of the crooks recollection of the tale.It's up to you to puzzle out the whole truth of what really happened here. The reveal comes in the final mission of story two, but it's easy to miss what happened if you aren't expecting it.I continue to play this game and highly recommend it for the price it is now (15$, and certainly recommend it on sale)			",156,34,0,22,12,2,14

												Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of my favorite games. I just want to start with that. I got this game a couple months ago and I'm hooked. Yeah, it's a little frustrating at times, but only in that sort of ""Aargh I'm not quite good enough for this level!"" way.Monaco is kind of a fun time-waster singleplayer, but where it really shines is multiplayer. It is FANTASTIC, and not just for the sake of completion. It's so much fun to run through the levels, causing chaos, or try to not get spotted at all. Make sure you discuss your plans with other players, but don't be surprised when things fall apart because of an unlucky corner with five guards behind it.The way powers help your friends makes the teamwork element of this game happen so naturally you might not even realize you're doing it at first. The hacker runs through a hallway trailing viruses, and the laser grid in your way just dies. The Mole digs a tunnel, and you escape through it to a nearby shrub. And everyone loves a Lookout. If there's one character who doesn't play well with teams, it's the Pickpocket, whose power is purely self-focused and who tends to hoard all the coins. If everyone's okay with that, by all means, play him. But if you're just browsing for random games online, it's polite to not use the pickpocket.The difficulty wobbles a bit around the start of the second act, but it pretty much goes steadily up from there. And keeps going up. This works to the game's advantage. The difficulty curve gives you enough time to get used to the system, and then slowly works in new elements and characters, and by the time you're dealing with the really hard stuff, you've got at least an idea of what to do. You may not be able to do it on your first try, or even your first ten, but you should be able to understand at least the theory of how the pieces fit together.Replay value? The game has incredible replay value. Not only are there eight characters to play through with, but there's an entire community of fan-made maps to play, and once you've done all the main story, there's even a zombie mode for more violent fun! I've already beaten the main story, and I'm working my way through the stunningly difficult final campain, ""Fin"". I am curious how they might expand the story that I thought was over, but it seems to be a well-written wrap-up.The story is simple, but has a few twists to make it more satisfying. Without spoiling too much, I will say that I would have been satisfied with the game if it had concluded with ""Identity"". The two (much shorter) extra acts were icing on the cake. It's a pretty standard heist plot, with a little bit of ""how we got here"" thrown in, betrayals, and other standard tropes of the genre, but it managed to surprise me in places, which made me very happy. It's not often you get to play a mystery from the villain's perspective and still be surprised.If I'm ambivalent about only one aspect, it would be the artstyle. The sprites are charming, but it's really quite difficut to tell who's who at times, and for colorblind players, this would be completely incomprehensible. Everyone looks like squares, including the enemies. The top-down angle limits the perspective, but the backgrounds do not suffer from the same confusion as the characters. They are gorgeous, elaborate, and the way lighting is used is something I've never seen in another stealth game. In some of the levels, I can even look down through the floor to see bits of the lower areas. The music is amazing, but since the levels can be a bit long, it loops a lot. It's by no means grating, and it spreads the clips out with slow, quiet periods, so it doesn't get stuck in your head too often, but it could have used a little variety. I loved the musical cues for when someone got spotted or an objective was completed, though.All in all, a fantastic game, and one that I'd readily recommend to anyone who likes stealth games, co-op games, or mysteries.Singleplayer: 3/5. A little tedious, but fun and challenging.Multiplayer: 5/5. The game's strongest point. One of the best co-op experiences I've ever had.Art: 3/5. The sprites were limited, but the settings were gorgeous.Sound: 4/5. The music was excellent, and I wish there had been more variety to it. The voices of the characters were delightful, even if I couldn't understand a word of french.Difficulty: 4/5. Quite a challenge, but not so difficult you become disenchanted. You learn and get better noticably over time.Replay: 5/5. Many levels, community-made maps, and excellent multiplayer. The end is just the beginning.			",121,34,0,18,2,2,4

												Monaco was an interesting concept and was alright for awhile. The problem is, the game provides a co-op function which it then, through its very design, discourages you from using. There is no way to make any permanent progress on any given level. Any deterrent you use to reduce the number of potential threats (even shooting the guards or exploding them) can be reversed by other guards, and murdering everyone on every map is impractical, if not impossible. This means that ultimately, the best way to beat any map is to remain undetected, but remaining undetected is infinitely easier when playing alone, as cooperative matches often just turn into a smash-and-grab chaotic cluster♥♥♥♥.  At the same time, playing the game alone is almost pathetically easy, and feels hollow. In either case, the concept felt a bit unpolished and there was never a sense, at least not for me, that careful planning and slow, steady progress on a level would reward a player (or group of players) with a superior playing experience, so every level just devolved into ""Grab what you can, die in a bush, and hope someone survives to revive you.""Suffers from the same problem Dungeon Defenders did, in that it provides cooperative play without an incentive to utilize it (indeed in both cases it was almost a hindrance to bring others into the game).Had some fun with it though, probably worth checking out if you're not expecting much and you're just looking for a casual experience to share with a few people. I'd recommend waiting for a sale though.			",107,33,0,51,8,1,26

												A simple 'yes' for a recommendation doesn't seem powerful enough for what is, truly, one of the finest experiences of gameplay I've ever seen.Take 1 part heist movie, 1 part crayloa 64-count crayon box, 1 part mad magazine, and 1 part jaw-droppingly gorgeous soundtrack, and you being to get an idea of what the game is. You're a thief - and your job is to Pokemon the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone elses valuables in the city of Monaco. Want to break into rooms quicker? Locksmith. Want to see everything at all times? Lookout. Want to....clean? The Cleaner. This game takes every single heist movie trope, turns it on it's ear, and then wraps it up in the most simple but polished beyond measure gameplay you're likely to find on any platform.Oh, and that's just single player.Multiplayer is even better. You REALLY learn about how your friends that you always planned that incredible heist with would react in that situation, because guess what? Neither one of you think alike, and you're going to be tripping alarms and getting shot by security guards left and right. The best part of this game, however, is Austin Wintory's score. It's simply gorgeous, and makes an already great game my 2014 game of the year.			",115,42,1,19,7,3,17

												This review prepares one mentally for Monaco's negative points. It is a great stealth game which I highly recommend but these are some things which you should know before purchasing. I can sing the praises for this game in the voice of a singing skald but that defeats the purpose of a review.-----------------------GraphicsIt is confusing distinguishing what the icons on the map symbolize and the lighting looks like a complete mess. It takes quite awhile (at least 5 hours) just getting fully accustomed to the visuals of the game.DifficultyThe game has a very gentle learning curve that only gets hard toward the end of the second campaign. This can be a problem for some players as there are a lot of hidden mechanics which isn't taught anywhere and you have to figure these things out on your own.For other players, the first half game is extremely easy just brute forcing your way through. Don't be too hasty in shrugging off the game as the difficulty ramps up towards the latter half. There are countless challenging workshop maps too.WorkshopThere are over a hundred good custom maps available in the workshop (if you know where to look), this is the reason the game has a tonne of content for hours of fun. While the editor is great and easy to pick up, the lack of players will mean anything you make is left for dead.Anti-social Hosts (Aka. Why you should not get Monaco)The 'community' is pretty dead and newer players have a tendency to kick strangers out of a lobby even if there are vacancies. Unfortunately, most hosts are unbothered to have these games in private. If you do get the game, it is best to at least have a friend or two to join you. Chaos in a party is what makes Monaco great. There will be more players during the summer sale so grab the game then.Colour-blindnessColour-blind mode doesn't help much and it's a game where colours are used to differentiate things easily. :P-----------------------TL:DRGrab the game if it's on sale, it's a steal stealing stealers stealing money like a monkey, with a monkey.

												Beware people with colorblindness such as myself, when you are playing co-op with others, it almost impossible to tell which character you are playing as, causing many frustrations when you think you are controlling your character but instead trying to control someone else's and the colorblindness mode does slim to nill to actually fix that problem.

												Monaco can be a nice game to casually solo but the real fun comes from running with accomplices. The more thieves racing through the map, getting beaten and shot, the crazier time you will have. Watch your friends die in horrible places, like the center of a heavily populated dance floor. Plan elaborate rescue missions to recover your friend's corpse from within a crowd of dancing NPCs. Get beat up by the guards as you struggle to recover your fallen comrade. Laugh at how miserably you failed.10/10			",161,38,1,22,14,1,18

												The level of sneakery in this game is fantastic. You can get through the entire game without being seen, but even if you do get spotted, it's still entertaining running around, ducking into AC vents and evading the security guards. The best part of the gameplay is its simplicity. You have one item, and the character you choose has one special ability. The difficulty curve is actually really well-made. You start in levels with just a handful of guards, and eventually reach sprawling levels with lots of automated security systems and attack dogs and stuff. Amazingly, it works as both a singleplayer and multiplayer experience. It's a lot better in multiplayer, because four people running around knocking people out, setting off alarms, and planting C4 is better than one. But it can stand on its single player experience. There's a level editor and the developers have released a few new content packs for free, so that's pretty cool. If you like heist games and general stealthy sneaky hiding-in-bushes and running around stealing stuff, this game is definitely for you.			",108,15,0,11,17,2,15

												Monaco is an excrutiatingly difficult 4-player co-op fast-paced stealth game played from a top-down perspective with many unique characters to play as.While it starts simple, this game becomes progressively more complex and challenging, demanding your crew to have great spatial awareness, a lot of patience, wit, and most importantly, synchronization. Violence is only a countermeasure when there's no other way to solve a dangerous problem (like an alert) and supplies are very limited. Each crewmate can only hold one type of item and stocks of it are only generated by collecting many coins, forcing teams to prioritize coin collection to a certain individual depending on the item and the map being played.Overall, a very fun and addicting game, completely recommended.

												Probably one of the best co-op (local or online) games out there. The stealth mechanics manage to fit well with the generally arcadey feel, as the guards aren't super perceptive, so they can be avoided if you're careful (and sometimes if you aren't!). Stealth playthroughs, especially in singleplayer, are satisfying and tense. However, Monaco is just as fun when you don't try to be stealthy, as you can get into crazy and action-filled situations as you're forced to escape oncoming guards after you trip an alarm or get caught. The AI can be punishing, though, and some enemies, such as shotgun toting Gendarme, are not to be taken lightly. Multiplayer tends to lean towards the more wild approach unless you're working in a two-man crew or everyone is trying to stay on the down-low. You're given the pick of (once you unlock all of them) eight thieves, each with their own unique abilities, all of which are useful. This is another reason why the game shines in multiplayer, because each thief can tackle different situations that others would have trouble with. There's also a good number of equipments which provide the player with some tool that can get help them get the job done, like smoke bombs, shotguns, C4, and EMPs. Monaco has a ton of standard campaign levels with unique settings and good variety, and there's also hundreds of user-made levels, some of which are almost as good as the standard ones. The level editor itself is fairly easy to use once you understand the basics, and there are a couple of really extensive guides on the community page which can help get you started. It's also got a sweet noir style piano soundtrack by Austin Wintory, the guy who made the Journey soundtrack.Now, all of this comes with, as I see it, one major catch. Monaco is a really old game, as far as indie online co-op games go (it seems). There's a way smaller community base than there was a few years ago, so finding players can be a challenge. Because of this, I'd recommend that you find a friend willing to play with you, or try the local co-op. If neither of those work out for you, try and leave a message on the community board asking for players. From what I've seen, there are some people who would be willing to play.			",26,4,0,0,4,0,1

												Now, this game is VERY, VERY underrated for no reason. Monaco: What's your's is mine is a game for 1-4 players that put players into the roles of french heisters. Player can choose between 8 characters: Locksmith, Cleaner, Pickpocket, Lookout, Redhead, Mole, Gentleman and Hacker. Each character has it's own abilites, for example, Gentleman can disguise and he is practicly invisible to enemies for some time. Game has a lot levels, and even if you pass them all, you can still download some from workshop, or even make your own (like I did)! Making your own levels is a little hard in the beggining, but believe me, it becomes MUCH easierafter 4-5 minutes. It is a lot of fun to make some joke maps and try to pass impossible maps. Game is best played with your friends or online with other people. Now, we came to the problem of the game. It has dead community. Really, if you try to find a multiplayer match, you will most likely end up disappointed. This game has fallen to this level that people doesn't even know what game are you talking about just because of the dead community. As I said, this game HAS to be filled with players, because it deserves at least that much. Please, all of you, buy this game and help this game rise to the place where it belongs.Game is absolute 10/10, would recommend to anyone.			",109,11,3,4,11,0,7

When Monaco is working — when two or more people are picking through its stages, evading traps, conking out guards, and breaking into dangerous territory, it clicks like an expensive safe.

												This game is unique. Strategy and cooperation at its best. Play alone to hone your ninja skills (without the need of flashy graphics or a third dimension) or play with friends where each one of you selects a different, often crucial, role in a heist. The gameplay is simple but adequate while the 8 playable characters offer completely different approaches to the same goal. You can run around take the objective and escape or you can take your time and clear out anything of value. The game's random factors allow replaying, which is always a pro in a game and in-game/steam achievements force you to try new things. The screenshots cannot convey the fact that while playing this game you have no need for more detailed graphics. Like chess what matters are the values of the players and their positions so don't judge it too fast.			",173,26,4,29,15,3,46

												A surprisingly complex game stems from a very simple goal: steal all the goods in the building and don't get caught. The presentation of the game is very well done, as every little detail in the visuals of the game makes sense in some terms of either the mechanics or the story of the game. The art style of the game is something new to almost anyone, and the co-op play in Monaco is some of the best there is in the Steam market. Community maps are also being made daily, so the replay value of this game is also top notch. Quite the hidden gem to be discovered by anyone who enjoys uniqueness and creativeness in both presentation and gameplay.			",130,14,1,10,13,1,12

												This is definitely one of the best indie games i've played in a long time.You play as one of several crooks -- all with their separate traits and abilities.You work together with other players to use each ability to your advantage and clean out a heist with style.The fog of war system is top notch and the game has minimal bugs.However, one bug in particular that is especially annoying to me is a bug where if you alt-tab when in full screen mode, you can't go back to the game. This is particularly annoying for me because I alt-tab a lot, but it can be fixed by playing in windowed mode.All in all, a great game. 10/10			",48,3,1,2,7,0,2

 Hours of multiplayer fun If you enjoy playing co-op games with friends, this is a must-have.Even the moments of frustration will bring you closer together.

												Hilarious game! great campaign mode - very deep - lots of opportunities to be creative with your heist - plan with friends.  Large levels with many features, laser alarms, sentry guns, guard dogs, pet cats, phone calls etc. Classes are varied and interesting, can be combined in many ways to form unique crews for different ideas on how to go about each heist. Even includes a fun PvP mode to compete with friends - where you steal trophies from the map and from the other players and attempt to flee the level. I expected this game to be fun - but i am so impressed by how much it exceeded my expectations. This is a very polished and well thought out game. If you have friends you game with regularly this is a fantastic game for you guys to enjoy. i highly recommend for those that want to have big laughs with friends over voice comms.

												Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is a top down 2D heist game where you and 3 other optional players play as different characters with each having their own abilities over 2 main story acts and 2 supplement acts. The first two acts have a large amount of levels where the last two supplement acts only have a handful, however they are difficult. The game encourages team work as the later levels become incredibly difficult and requires lots of practice and runs. This is a perfect team game but also plays very differently solo and is still lots of fun hiding from enemies and trying to figure out the best paths to take or how best to utilize your character's ability in the level. The game is lots of fun and becomes hectic and fast paced when you trip an alarm and you're trying to run away from the enemies!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't finished playing it yet, but it's absolutely a fine single-player stealth game with lots of replayability that doesn't give any special advantages to one character like all those other co-op games do. Every character has their own two special advantages (except for the Redhead, whose second ability is crippled from a lack of other players), and you could complete the campaign from start to finish using any of them. So if the single-player is really good and stands up on its own from the co-op for once, why play co-op? Answer: Four players running around having their perfect plan ruined by a difficult or unexpected triviality, running from the guards and trying to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of there without screwing everything up further. This is hilarious, and when the players succeed, it's hilarious and a sight to behold. Also the sound and visual design are pitch perfect as well.			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

												At first I thought this game was all smoke and mirrors when it came to the game play and graphics, but up until I took the time to actually play this game then I realized the potential it has playing yourself or playing online with others. The games premise is to rob places without being detected, which seems simple right? The unique portion is working together as each different player or unit has a specific function. There are 8 different classes to unlock while progressing through the game : the locksmith, the pickpocket, the cleaner, the lookout, the mole, the gentleman, the hacker, the redhead. In order, the locksmith can pick locks a lot faster than anyone, the pickpocket is able to acquire coins from a greater distance and doesn't alert guards or trigger alarms, the cleaner can knock out guards and heal faster, the lookout can see a vast majority of whats going on from great distances, the mole can rip through almost any wall (my favorite characteristic!), the gentleman is able to disguise himself, the hacker can disable alarms and spread viruses into computer systems and finally, the redhead who is able to attract enemies and have them open doors for her while not harming other immediate players. Some of these players come when you first start the game while others have to be unlocked as you progress (nothing wrong with that)! Map designs are also very fluid and challenging. Some parts will seem impossible to get by without a helping hand. There is usually always a way though if you're stuck playing solo.The unique view setting this game provides is the excitement through it's graphics. Although simple in premise, it's very effective in providing a good game play experience (unless you don't like this sort of thing and are bound to stylish 3D graphics). Sounds are absolutely fantastic and as a French speaking individual, it's greatly appreciated. I'm sure those who do not speak French will start picking up a few things as well. The dialogue is okay (I wish they added a bit more) but for the most part it does a good job keeping you on your toes.I would recommend buying it on sale.Indie Rating : 8/10RATING : 7.2/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B- Overall  B-ScreenShots : My friend is hacking while I'm breaking down walls There are graphic indicators in game to show where your friends are (notice bottom left) Don't alert the guard don't alert the guard don't alert the guard If you're making holes in the wall, the guards can hear it ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												Extremely satisfying heist game. It's not exactly a fully stealth game, getting found is not the end of the world, you just need to escape and hide. The gameplay alternates between  trying to be stealthy and purposefuly or mistakenly getting discovered while accomplishing some objective. The coop experience is vastly different than the solo experience. The ideal is to have a group of 4 friends and play together.			",71,21,1,6,6,0,14

												tl;dr: It's a top-down heist game about collecting shiny things. Maybe get it if you have friends to play with, and both of you are willing to spend a couple hours figuring out mechanics. What is Monaco? Monaco is a game where you control four (supposedly) elite thieves across a complex level in a quest to collect all shiny things. To make things fun, its levels also contains a lot of traps and guards. Some of them will shoot at you with bullets, while another will have explosives in order to try to kill you. In order to deal with that, you can use various items such as bullets and explosives to try to not die. Though you can just sneak past all of them if you just hold shift (but it's slow so only do it when you need to). At the end of the level, the game will look at your timer and add penalty for any shiny things you might've missed before putting you into a leaderboard. Uhm, supposedly? Monaco have this weird inclination to not teach you things you need to know. For example : In the upcoming steam sale, there will be many lobbies. However, most of them will kick you if you try to join because they actually want to play with their friends but they don't know how to make private lobby. There's also the fact that you won't know what's the key to toggle shared view unless you go to the option menu (it's E). Heck, even the stealth is not really explained. Your thief can move right in front of a guard's nose without alerting them or use an atm that is being camped by a guard, but you won't know how to unless you're willing to experiment for a while. Is the multiplayer alive? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I only play pub games roughly once a week, mostly because I rarely find a lobby during weekdays. Maybe you can randomly add people during steam sale? Is the singleplayer fun? Sure, most of my pub games is basically just me playing solo while occassionaly reviving others. The game doesn't have much replay value on solo play unless you're into speedrunning, but there's 40 levels that should keep you entertained for a while.			",104,19,0,17,8,1,16

												This game was quite a steal.What? No one on drums? Do I REALLY have to do this? Ugh, screw it. To the review!Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is an indie game released last year. It is stealth and puzzle based, with some action elements in it and a whole lot of teamwork. For the most part, I really enjoy the game. Seeing there's so much to say, I'll say it as best as I can, like I say in pretty much all of my reviews.We'll start off with, hmm... How about visuals. Y'know what they say, ""First is the worst, second is the best, third is the one with the (Treasure, hairy, etc) chest."" So, like that said, ""First is the worst."" Allthough, the graphics aren't all that bad. They just don't compare to the greatness of the rest of the game. It has the retro feel to it. Kinda stale, as lots of indie games do that, but I've seen worse.So, second is the best. I give the gameplay the ""2nd is the best"" award. The gameplay is so, open. You can choose your playstyles and take advantage of that with one of the eight classes to choose from. If you want to run around and knock people out so your teammates can get to the next floor or car, pick the Cleaner. If the place is heavily guarded with lasers and such, pick the Hacker. If you're too lazy to strategize and want to get to the next floor, choose the Mole. There are many secrets to discover, and some of them can actually be quite humorous. So yeah, you can explore the rooms to get all the loot, since there is no time limit. No, I'm not done yet. Did I mention that there was a LEVEL EDITOR? For you creative minds out there (like myself, no, seriously!) you will enjoy the level editor. It is very simple to use. After looking at a guide made by Andy Nguyen, the man that designed most of the levels in Monaco, I was able to learn how to add lasers and such. I discovered that unlike other difficult level editors *cough* Super Meat Boy *cough* I was able to create a level. The only other game that I can think of with a level editor that simple is LittleBigPlanet. If anything, Monaco's level editor is easier to use, and you're talking to an LBP fanboy. Okay, let's continue before I begin to talk about LBP...I'll go to the story next. Although there isn't much of a story, there are pre-dialogues before every mission, so you can get info on what's going on. I thought it was acceptable and a little surprising to see how well done it is. I have low expectations on story, unless it's a huge story based game. I think Monaco's story is interesting. Especially for the Lockpicker's story. But hey, there isn't much else to say.Now, for the audio. Not much to it. Okay, not much to it when talking about the AI. Okay. I take that back. There are lots of awesome sounds in this game. That's it. Fooled you! I didn't talk about the magnificent soundtrack. Monaco's songs are mostly piano songs, but when played in a game like this, it was done in an amazing way. It's not an ""Oh. My. God. Drooling! Drooling! Drooling! Drooling!"" soundtrack, not like Bastion's or FTL's anyway, but I enjoy it. Replayability time. Since I only have a couple hours into the game, I don't know much about replayability. However, I do know it does last you quite some time. You can try and get #1 on the All-Time list for the record times, or you could design more levels. It's up to you. What's funny is that these paragraphs are all small except for gameplay. Well, I'm doing my best to keep this not biased.Now, for the flaws. Don't worry, almost done! Despite Monaco's many, many pros, there are some pretty major flaws that need to be pointed out. Okay, to be honest, it's one major flaw. Ready? The AI in this game is HORRIBLE. And I do mean HORRIBLE. So, I climb up a ladder to hide from guards, but one climbs up, walks right through me, and climbs down without noticing me right IN FRONT OF HIM. Also, I ran away from another group of guards, not far away and still visible, I stay there and wait for the pursuing guards to catch me. What's the problem? Those lazy fatasses decided to go back to their post. There are countless more stories about how big of morons these guards are. Want me to tell you some more? No? That's what I thought. Let's finish this thing.In conclusion, Monaco is an amazing game. Fun, simple gameplay mechanics, neat soundtrack, a surprising story, and pretty impressive replayability, you'll definitely enjoy the game. One of the few gems from last year the I, personally, think should have gotten more praise, despite it already having a couple positive reviews. However, the moron AI makes the game a lot less difficult and lame. If you don't mind bad AI and stale graphics, then you're in for one enfer d'un tour, which means ""hell of a ride"" in French.

												Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine, is another game that falls under the category of ""Not sure what to play? Well why not this?"". I will recommend this game to anyone, and say that it is a game that I should have picked up a lot earlier than I did. It is a fun and neat little indie game that can offer hours of gameplay once you get into it. It is very intuitive and can offer a challenge to almost anyone. I have only played it for about 4 hours, and in that time I only beat the first story-line (it was a very relaxed 4 hours, mind you). The game is very addictive once you start, and you will find more and more difficulty in the various levels as you go on.The biggest downside to this game is that it can be very hard to find a multiplayer game without at least one dumbass who can and will ruin it for others, but once you do find that one team, you can swoop through the entire game no problem in a short time.As for the crew, I found it fun to play more or less each of them, but I did find a few that I favorited over others, due to their playstyle, and I imagine most people will as well.

												The gameplay and story is essentially about 8 characters who are all criminals, looking to steal some stuff. The story is told in conversation snippets before each mission between characters. Visuals are pretty much demonstrated by the screenshots. Design and mechanics are simple, which I like though it may not be to everyone's taste. The characters only have one specific different skill and a hidden secondary skill that makes them all feel different, but not overly so. A nice surprise about the game for me was that I found out a year after owning Monaco that they had updated the maps, providing more/newer content for free with older maps remain playable. Though single player is good, the multiplayer is what makes it great. Maps get notoriously difficult at later stages and very difficult to beat without help. It can get frustrating, but clearing them also feels incredibly rewarding. Keep in mind however it's rare to see open/public lobbies (from what I've seen), so make sure you have friends to play with. Replay value is high when not going solo.I would recommend this game for most people, unless you are completely sure it is not your cup of tea. If it's on sale, it's definitely worth a purchase.

-Quick Review-Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine is a 2d stealth game that is played from the top view the whole time. The game is very random in puzzle nature so it’s difficult to plan for whatever you face in the game. You can play between several different campaigns and also play player-based maps.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  The first campaign you are the Locksmith, tell the story of escaping from prison and trying to make it to a new country and leave his past of crime behind him. Unfortunately the temptation of getting additional wealth starts to pull him away from his initial intentions.Additional campaigns tell of a more elaborate story, the second campagn is about the Pickpocket, whom is narrating and telling a different story from the Locksmith. There are two more campagns but I haven’t played those yet, because of the increasing difficulty in the puzzles.(Where are my Ninja stars and places to sneak and hide?  //Goes back to Ninja games)Game Play: In Monaco you can choose between eight different characters, each with their own ability’s to help them get through the various puzzles. There are useful guides to help you understand more about what the characters do.To list the basic starting four characters: the locksmith can picklocks really fast, the Pickpocket has a pet monkey that collects loot, the cleaner knocks people out (when they don’t see him), the lookout can detect enemies that are farther away and out of your line of site.Achievements: The achievements in this game are rather straight forward, but also rather tough. As usual you get several achievements just from beating a few levels, but in the end most of the achievements will require a lot of work to earn. Most can be earned with guides on offline single player. But the rest will requirePrice: Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine costs $14.99, for me that is overpriced, but you could easily get many hours of gaming out of it. If you do get over 20 hours out of the game (and know you love stealth based games and a lot of challenge) it’s probably a fair price.I feel like it’s not fair for me to say that I don’t recommend the game because of the price, I just really didn’t enjoy the game, but it was a good game and I think it’s worth a try… try the free weekend or a demo or something before you purchase it to know for certain if you like this style of game. Conclusion: I really thought this game was interesting, different, unique, and added a great amount of challenge compared to most classical stealth games. But this game would be way more fun to play with friends. Even when I played a few games with strangers I enjoyed the fast paced gameplay.But I really can’t say this game makes it on my top list. I would recommend this game just because I think it deserves a chance, but once again; try it on a free weekend or a demo of some type before you purchase, so you know ahead of time what you’re getting yourself into.

												A splendid game to play with friends, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is a top-down game puzzle-ish co-op game with a simplistic but very pleasing art style. Now, when I say this game is a ""puzzle-ish co-op game"", I say that because it's not quite a puzzle game, as it has elements of action to it, but completing each mission can be seen as a ""puzzle"" of sorts. I'd say it's a stealth game, but it's not entirely that, either: while stealth can make things easier, blitzing through a room and drawing all eyes to you can work occasionally also. The goal of each level is to steal all trophies before exiting via the escape route, with an added side objective of collecting as many coins as you can to get a higher score. The main obstacles in the game are the guards, who, upon seeing you, chase you down and beat you senseless until you either escape their pursuit or die. When the latter happens, you can get revived by your buds, but doing so leaves you vulnerable for a decent amount of time, so caution is necessary. By default, you have no means of combat, leaving avoidance of threats as the best option. However, there are items that allow you to better deal with threats, like smoke bombs, sleeping darts, guns, and explosives (possibly others I may have missed), of which you can have one equipped at a time, and all of which are replenished by collecting the previously mentioned coins throughout the level. In addition to guards, there are other obstacles, though most of them just draw the attention of the guards so they can go about their merciless beatings of your team. To offer a wider array of methods to deal with the various things between you and your loot, the game has a character system in which each character has a special ability unique to them; there is a very nice diversity of character choice, with each character possibly opening up alternative routes to the objectives. For instance, the Hacker can hack into terminals and disable nearby electronics, such as cameras and laser sensors, the Cleaner can knock guards unconscious when behind them, and the Mole can break through (some) walls. The game is certainly a lot less interesting and enjoyable when playing alone, as it's meant to be a co-op game first and foremost. It has a story mode, and I have no strong feelings regarding the story either way, but the levels are very well-done, generally. The game has a built-in level editor and thus aptly is tied to the Steam Workshop, so when you're finished with the campaign, there are plenty of community levels to peruse as well, a fair amount of which are bound to be substantial and enjoyable.In short, fantastic little co-op game that's fun, interesting, and worthwhile. I had a blast playing it, and it's probably one of my favorite little indie games (and by ""indie"", I mean the real definition of indie—that is, self-published and independent of any larger company; sorry, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of that term is killing me) of all time, simply based on how much of a good time I had with it.

												In 2014 an awkward group of Skullgirls players decided to play something else for a change. These nerds promptly went to their games tab and downloaded Monaco. Today, still being terrible at this game, they survive as scrubs of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can voip them, maybe you can hire: The S-Team.

												Kind of like a stealth-oriented Hotline Miami, the name of the game in Monaco is to get in, steal an objective, get out, while taking all the dosh along the way. Unlike most stealth games though, Monaco expects you to be caught, and gives you tools to deal with a situation. That's not to say finesse isn't important, since you have to earn additional gear usage.The characters have different abilities and each one has a different way of handling the same level, giving great replayability.Single-player and multi-player also have very different methods of approach.Like all good games, it starts off simple but becomes quite challenging in the end. Getting all of the gold in a level unlocks mirrored, more difficult versions of the levels.The music is a smooth ragtime piano that changes to fit the action. Haven't heard anything like it in other games.Comes with a level editor, and the hours of additional play that entails.I had a ton of fun with this game and I think you will too.

												★★★★★Director Andy Schatz realizes his vision of creating a Slapstick comedy disguised as a David Mamet thriller. Follow the mishaps of a bumbling crew trying to hit it big on the French Riviera. An all star cast includes George Clooney (The Gentleman), Christina Hendricks (The Redhead), John Leguizamo (The Hacker) and Randy Savage (The Cleaner) with many more surprise guests! A multi-layered narrative cleverly unravels the intrigue behind the group as it builds and performs daring heists. Monaco: What's Yours is Mine gives thrill seekers the intense highs and lows they've come to love from their favorite heist movies while appealing to those outside the genre with its lightheartedness. Grab three friends and enjoy seeing the world through the eyes of the four stooges trying to reinact the Zoolander Computer scene. Team Chuckle♥♥♥♥ approved.

												So like Metal Gear Solid calls up Lock 'n' Chase on the Swankphone one night and is all, ""Hey bee, y'ahna slide on over for Ballparks and moscato,"" and Lock 'n' Chase is all like, ""AW ♥♥♥♥♥ YOU KNOW I LIKES DAT MOSCATO"" and 9 months later, Monaco pops out from somewhere dark, wearing shades and decked out in Don Johnson's old closet.Metal Gear Solid, by the way, is never heard from again after that. Prick.The plan in Monaco is pretty simple: theft. Sure, you and your larcenous lot could stealth your way in and out of the various locations of Monte Carlo in a smooth, concerted takedown of the local authorities and rival criminals but, damn, isn't that your Lookout eyeing your coin? Well, ♥♥♥♥ THAT GUY, whoosh, to the blue sharks with 'im (HAHAHA) and off to snag the Big Loot on the top floor of the bank and YEAH YOU GOT IT and oh double turdcakes you could really be using that Lookout now in order to facilitate your escape, couldn't you? Balls, this job is hard.Honor among thieves? Only if you can afford it and in Monaco, pretty much everything is expensive.			",503,310,1,44,18,2,17

Takes a little while to figure out all of the mechanics and interpret the icons.  There really is a lot of information thrown at you right away.  Once you get used to the flow of gameplay, it is highly rewarding and makes you feel skilled at the profession you start developing an inclination towards. The variety of characters, the catchy ragtime-like piano music, and fast paced stealth action will get you really into this game!  Grab some friends and steal some stuff in Monaco!

												Bottom line, this is Ocean's Eleven: The Game. And that is a hefty recommendation all by itself.Up to four players choose one of 8 crooks, each with a unique specialty. The Locksmith opens doors and safes quickly, the Cleaner neutralizes people when they're not looking. Then the team must work together to pull off heist objectives, or, more challenging, get every available coin.The action takes place in a top-down view. Layered systems of security, from dogs and motion sensitive cameras to civilians that alert nearby guards, must be bypassed or defeated to get in, get rich, and get out.The control scheme is marvelously compact. There is a sneak button and a use-special-item button. There is a button to bring up the HUD and see how much life you have and how many coins remain to be stolen in a level. There is a button for push-to-talk. And there is a control stick. If you want to do something, like unlock a door or hack into a computer, just walk into it.Online co-op feels magical. Even with strangers, you start to move as a team and think together. And if you don't, hilarity ensues as your careful plans go to pot. Can't omit the thoughtful graphics and sound design, but the core gameplay is the meat. It is new, and it is fabulous.A promised map editor will provide endless community content, to be released soon.In short, a must buy that may define 2013.			",142,73,1,29,33,2,31

												Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is, quite simply put, one of the most intelligent games released this year. The tightly structured gameplay is fast and fluid, and the colorful cast (quite literally) of playable characters are great. Everything about the game, from its mechanics to its presentation, to its music and its sound, feels original and fresh. Monaco is a game with a strong sense of self, a game that is acutely aware of its own eccentric identity and not afraid to show it, which is precisely what makes it such a strong title.In much the same fashion as Hotline Miami and Fez, the incredible art design shows just how much detail there can be in blocky, pixellated graphics. The music is nothing short of masterful, wearing its ragtime, silent-movie inspiration on its sleeve and being all the better for it. The sound design is phenomenal as well, with the typing of keys on a computer, to the whine and sharp snap of a breaker box, to the strange rumbling murmurs of a revive all contributing to the game's singular and unique personality.The game proves how millions of dollars aren't necessary in creating something fun and original; on the contrary, Monaco is important because it shows how so much can be done with so little. It shows the world that what a game really needs in order to stand out is an identity, something that many mainstream contemporary titles sorely lack. Thanks to the uniqueness and originality that pervades through every aspect of its construction, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of the best, and one of the most important, games released in recent memory. Buy it now if you haven't already.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Best played with people in the same room or at least with free-flowing voice chat. Works fine as a two-player game, but some levels would have been much easier with 3-4 people.Level design is brilliant and almost perfectly calibrated to increase the difficulty as you go. Except for Pearls Before Swine, that level was a ♥♥♥♥♥ and much harder then it needed to be. Not that I'm bitter about spending a week of evenings on a single level or anything. :) I didn't realize how awesome the levels were until I tried some of the featured / highly rated workshop levels. Most of those aren't worth the time yet. Maybe in time as people get better at designing...The storyline was actually interesting. I'm usually a ""mash the button to skip past all these stupid words"" type, but not this time. Very well done.It does have a few annoying aspects:- If your connection to Steam drops, you'll get booted from the game. You can't reconnect to a game. - The menu interface is stupid. Good luck trying to exit the game and managing to hit the right combination of Space and Esc without reading the options every time. If you prefer to play on LAN instead of over Steam, you'll have to set that every.single.time even though it seems to remember all the other settings just fine. - The outlet/coin spawns are randomly generated, so sometimes you may want to restart a level if your team has a hacker and the outlet placement sucks.* My spouse has been speedrunning levels for weeks now, so it's also a great single player game if leaderboards and completionism are your thing. I think he's nuts. :) ",48,15,0,7,28,0,14

												Bottom line, this is Ocean's Eleven: The Game. And that is a hefty recommendation all by itself.Up to four players choose one of 8 crooks, each with a unique specialty. The Locksmith opens doors and safes quickly, the Cleaner neutralizes people when they're not looking. Then the team must work together to pull off heist objectives, or, more challenging, get every available coin.The action takes place in a top-down view. Layered systems of security, from dogs and motion sensitive cameras to civilians that alert nearby guards, must be bypassed or defeated to get in, get rich, and get out.The control scheme is marvelously compact. There is a sneak button and a use-special-item button. There is a button to bring up the HUD and see how much life you have and how many coins remain to be stolen in a level. There is a button for push-to-talk. And there is a control stick. If you want to do something, like unlock a door or hack into a computer, just walk into it.Online co-op feels magical. Even with strangers, you start to move as a team and think together. And if you don't, hilarity ensues as your careful plans go to pot. Can't omit the thoughtful graphics and sound design, but the core gameplay is the meat. It is new, and it is fabulous.A promised map editor will provide endless community content, to be released soon.In short, a must buy that may define 2013.			",142,73,1,29,33,2,31

												Wow wow wow!  Another very strong Indie game this year that is a must-buy!  At its core, it KIND of feels like a really complex Pac-man.  Takes a little while to figure out all of the mechanics and interpret the icons.  There really is a lot of information thrown at you right away.  Once you get used to the flow of gameplay, it is highly rewarding and makes you feel skilled at the profession you start developing an inclination towards. The variety of characters, the catchy ragtime-like piano music, and fast paced stealth action will get you really into this game!  Grab some friends and steal some stuff in Monaco!

												Ever wanted to construct the heist of the century? Well, now you can, in Monaco: What's Mine is Yours. Join up to three friends, foes, or strangers and take the heist experience online. Play as one of eight characters - four default - in an effort to sneak to, break into, or run to your prize: the ultimate heist. With clever progression, unique line-of-sight gameplay, and an irresistible charm, Monaco is the indie ""must have"" game of the year in my book.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is, quite simply put, one of the most intelligent games released this year. The tightly structured gameplay is fast and fluid, and the colorful cast (quite literally) of playable characters are great. Everything about the game, from its mechanics to its presentation, to its music and its sound, feels original and fresh. Monaco is a game with a strong sense of self, a game that is acutely aware of its own eccentric identity and not afraid to show it, which is precisely what makes it such a strong title.In much the same fashion as Hotline Miami and Fez, the incredible art design shows just how much detail there can be in blocky, pixellated graphics. The music is nothing short of masterful, wearing its ragtime, silent-movie inspiration on its sleeve and being all the better for it. The sound design is phenomenal as well, with the typing of keys on a computer, to the whine and sharp snap of a breaker box, to the strange rumbling murmurs of a revive all contributing to the game's singular and unique personality.The game proves how millions of dollars aren't necessary in creating something fun and original; on the contrary, Monaco is important because it shows how so much can be done with so little. It shows the world that what a game really needs in order to stand out is an identity, something that many mainstream contemporary titles sorely lack. Thanks to the uniqueness and originality that pervades through every aspect of its construction, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of the best, and one of the most important, games released in recent memory. Buy it now if you haven't already.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It takes a while to get used to, but Monaco is a fun and entertaining game. I'm not much on stealth ganes, but this one tells a good story, the mechanics are simple enough to learn, the characters are nicely done, and the music (piano) is fantastic.So I kept at it, began to understand what to do (not much explanation or tutorial in the game), and got myself hooked on the variety and style of gameplay. Time went by very quickly once the basics were learned. And the options available give you a lot of decisions to make.This one draws you in with initial simplicity, then steps up the challenge at just the right pace. It's fun, it's different, and I would recommend at least giving it a try. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is a rare must-have masterpiece that is beautifully crafted by Pocketwatch Games. The game follows the story of 8 crooks utilizing their unique assets and their assortment of weapons as they take back what is theirs. Monaco takes the player on a top down adventure and the path taken, a decision best left to your crooked ways. The art style and soundtrack lend to the game's exceptional theme and sense of class. Choose between single player or cross-platform multiplayer and play on a variety of campaign maps or challenge yourself with user created custom maps from the Steam Workshop. Worthy of note are the several major content updates that were free of charge. In an era where developers nickle and dime their fans, Pocketwatch Games is doing something right. I only wish that they would consider a sequel. Your Steam library may never be complete without this game.			",483,91,22,28,26,6,29

												Alone, with your friends or even with random people, this is a game you must play! Monaco was by far one of the best experencias i had this year related to videogames - counitng only to what was relesed this year -. Almost everthing is perfect on this game, from the visuals, OST and the COOP. COOP on this game is the cherry on top of the cake. Monaco has some diversity missions such as, heist, saving someone or get alive from some place. Also contains 3 game modes; Enhanced, Classic and Zombies. Enhanced is shorter, more streamlined maps and will make a better and easy experience. Classic mode that is purist, hard to say. Now to class, some to choose and they are all great. Going to give some examples, The Cleaner, he can put enemies to sleep, is really hand when you find a room full of them. The Mole, funny character to use, he can breaks for almost any room really good to dig shortcut's. I think you got the point that character in Monaco are fun and useful to use. If you ever get bored of doing COOP and SP you have two options; PVP and creation mode. PVP is here you against another player ""fight"" to see who stole the intel first and can escape alive. Very fun game type. The creation mode is here you can make your own levels, case you have a nice imagination you may get feature in Monaco weekly/month workshop levels. Another thing i love in games and i especially love this on in Monaco is the OST, is brilliant, this gentleman Austin Wintory[austinwintory.bandcamp.com] made an awesome job here. The OST is so calm and fits very well in this game. - I advise you hear the full ost on that site - Now that you read my shout review, go buy this game and enjoy it! Totally worth your money! ~ 8/10			",493,181,16,44,79,10,49

												One of the few Indie games that I can say I enjoyed. Monaco is the perfect mix of Hotline Miami, and Payday. With a simple design, usual heist game plot, this game is easy to grasp, suitable for gamers and non-gamers alike.However, this game has it's fair share of problems. The new October update, is dissapointing. The Origin campaign, whilst giving more info on the characters, feels like the same mission every time. I feel... more cheated out of a good promise, rather than dissapointed. The ""Zonaco"" zombie mode, is, well the same campaign. Only with zombies. So no round based, team oriented survival mode, like I hoped for. Saves us the screamers online, I suppose. + Story is well written, despite it's repetative missions+ Co-Op is tackled well, but the campaign can be played regardless without a partner+ Replayability. I have barely taken a chunk out of this game.+ Story is split into 2 Acts.- The October update. - It's easy to find the quick way around a mission, however the game tackles punishment well.7/10. A fun, well made Indie game.  ",113,22,4,15,5,1,5

												Monaco. As I sit here in my palatial library, peering through my grimoire and other works, I note that I have not extended the pleasure of a review to the unwashed masses. Substantial evidence points to varying activities which have kept me from this world of opinion and unsubstantiated claim and counter-claim but now I return from the dead. Does it matter that Monaco, written by Neil Patrick Harris & Sylvester Stallone, has come out? Is this what has brought about my sudden return from pseudo-retirement? In all likelyhood, it is not. Monaco follows the journey of a band of thieves and crooks through the eponymous city of Monaco, Kentucky. Eugene Onion (Dwayne Johnson) is joined by Ribroast Jones (Ben Kingsley), Shia McBoof (Michael Sheen) and Michael ""Canned"" Meet (Daniel Day Lewis). The band makes their way from heist to heist never stopping to ponder the ""why"" or ""how"" of the entire situation. The Mise-en-scène denotes a chaotic and bizarre existance, punctuated extravagantly through the performance of Whoopi Goldberg as Goldberg.Who's to say whether or not this follow up to the 1923 movie, ""The Man with a Hat on his Head"" will take off, all I can say is that this is a whole new direction for Marvel to take the Batman franchise in.

												A lot of people seem to be of the opinion that Monaco is only fun when played in Co-Op, and while it's true that the game is at its best in those kinds of frantic multiplayer games, I honestly think the single player version shines just as much-- it just feels like a totally different game. Whereas co-op in Monaco is all about laying out plans and watching them go horribly wrong --and the frantic, off-the-cuff attempts to coordinate efforts to salvage the heist-- in single player, its a slower, more calculated and tactical game, where your lone-wolf status makes heists incredibly tense. The heightened difficulty of launching these heists solo is undercut by the fact that you have multiple lives-- you can play as every member of the team in solo, which allows for players to die in an often advantageous way by allowing one's self to switch characters--  but it still brings a unique challenge to each of the masterfully designed levels. Throw in a killer piano soundtrack that lands somewhere between ragtime and vaudeville, an enjoyably executed (if slight) story that uses unreliable narration for clever effect, and a robust map-maker tool with countless community maps (to say nothing of the recently added 'zombie' mode, a word that normally makes me cringe due to the cultural oversaturation of zombies, but nonetheless makes for an enjoyable variation on the standard gameplay), and you have the most fun multiplayer game of the year.At the time I'm writing this, Monaco is $2.99 on a flash sale. I got it for 7.50, and I would've paid full price for it if I realized it would be this fun.			",220,52,4,15,19,3,27

												The game looks simple at first glance due to its artwork and design. But honestly, it very challenging once you  play it. This game shows that indie games aren't sucks, as a matter of fact most of the time they are the ones that make compelling games even if it looks cheap graphically, financially. Anyhow, I will definitely recommend this game.			",74,20,4,11,5,2,5

												Very fun and addictive game.What you do in here, is, 'robbing'.I love the part where I am a hacker and I can shut down computers and power sources. Cause that is super realistic.Time by time, when you play the game, you unlock characters. Every one of them, has a special abillity.For example:-Lockpicker= He can unlock things very quickly.-The cleaner= He can hit enemies-The Mole= He can crush through wallsAnd many more...So far I played like.. 1-2 hours or less, and I liked the game from the start.Here are the things WHY is this game awesome:-Good Graphics-Awesome Gameplay-Good Physics [movement, actions]-Sounds [Example: When you use a computer, it makes a sound of: ''Writing or typing, on a keyboard''-Addictive Storyline/Gameplay-You can hide in bushes and trees! Lmfao-Great characters-Extermely FunBad things about this game:-None.-Just If you don't like pixely and robbing games.. this isn't for you xDDIt's worth buying, doe I didn't buy, I got it as a gift, But BUY UNTIL THE DAILY DEAL LASTS!!!!!!!! ITS WORTH IT!			",195,20,9,16,14,0,10

												Monaco... a game I got and played with friends ages ago but didn't enjoy as much as I wish I could. As much as I thought I'd enjoy it on the outset I found the content of the game itself rather... disappointing. Let me tell you a tale:You watch the trailers, you see the tags (Like ""Stealth"", and ""Heist""), and screenshots and you think to yourself, rightly so - ""ah, this is a stealth game"". You then buy the game, and as you start making your way through the game, solo or with friends, you find that that there are various mechanics that help you sneak past guards and such, and overall the ideas presented from those scenarios and abilities allow for unique ways of approaching your stealth. Then you and your friends notice the leader boards for levels... and see that the top scores... somehow managed to do it in seconds?Here is the problem: You are given all these tools, all these characters with unique designs and abilities, which altogether help to make an interesting apporach to a stealth heist. However, you then realise the following - it is much easy, efficient, and high scoring to simply run through the entire level, alerting everything as you do so, completing the objective and collecting coins and just escaping. Put simply - you are given lots of tools, but none of them are more efficient than just blitzing your way through the level.Hence, the reason why I didn't enjoy it was because it was misleading, not to say that blitzing your way through isn't fun, I kind of enjoyed it, for a while anyway. However I came to and bought this game with the intention of a stealth game. Maybe if the game atleast sort of told you that this was another way to approach then maybe it would've been fine, but with such misleading trailers and unfortunately, good and unique mechanics that are overshadowed by simply running all over the place, makes me glad I was able to refund this game.

												This game is AWESOME!Monaco is a heist game.  When played singleplayer it's a fun, calculated, stealth game.  When played in multiplayer it finds the perfect balance of: pulling of the perfect heist and crazy run-and-gun game play!Although it does get very hectic when played with friends it's also more fun and satisfying!  Using each player unique abilities to their full potential, while working together is priceless!So what am I saying?  GET THE GAME!  If you like playing with friends, funny dialog bits, stealth/run-and-gun gameplay, or just awesome games, GET MONACO!			",170,29,1,17,10,1,19

												It takes less than 1 map to realize Monaco is a unique indie/strat/action/stealth game lol seriously, monaco may not look flashy or may even make you look away due to its graphics and artwork, but dont be fooled! Monaco is creative, its entertaining, will make you think about your move, will let you pick what class better suits your playstyle and immeadiatly you will understand why it looks the way it does...Like Home, frozen synapse and FTL, Monaco, shows unique features while keeping the indie characteristics we love.It is the simpler yet still awesome version of payday. Different classes, cleaning up banks etc. You can play it online or in lan or alone. Definetly recommend it, not only to indie fans, but to stealth top view fans or strat game fans. Its a simple challenging and rewarding game,  where fun can be extracted within seconds of opening it.			",146,22,2,25,13,1,34

Whether you're sneaking past someone or running from the cops in an all-out chase, it'll make be on the edge of your seat. Giving you an urge to try again when you die, and lots of pleasure when you succeed.The multiplayer is also very fun. Although finding servers for specific levels can take awhile, I haven't met any here who's especially mean. This game has a great community.Even if you play in singleplayer, this game will provide endless hours of entertainment, although not as chaotic as 4-player co-op. This game is amazing!

												Monaco is by far one of the best co-op games I've played.Due to the game's amazing accomodation to differing playstyles, Monaco can be a stealth game, shooter, or simply a run and gun race against the clock depending on how you play it!I was extremely excited for this game to come out, and it definitely lived up to the hype: polished controls, amazing soundtrack,  accomodating to multiple playstyles (not only with the different classes, but with the tools involved as well), and overall just a barrel of fun.I'd definitely recommend Monaco, whether you plan on playing alone, with friends, or with complete strangers.That feeling when you pull off a perfect heist?

One has the ability to put enemies to sleep for 30-60 seconds if they are not alerted. (sneak up on them). Another can ""charm"" her way into tricking one enemy to help with opening doors, etc. Another can break through walls (great for bypassing doors that are locked, especially double locked doors). Another can hack security systems and outlets to open doors and stuff.At first it looks like a crappy little 2d top view game, but once you get into it, it's much more than that.			",72,3,1,1,5,1,2

												Monaco is an excellent 4-player co-op game that offers a unique blend of action and puzzle solving. If you're confused by what you're seeing in the store, don't be alarmed. The screenshots and videos don't do this game justice; you have to actually play the game for a bit to get a feeling for what's going on. All that color and chaos comes together nicely when you're playing.Monaco is decent entertainment as a single-player game, but the single-player game is best used to get familiar with each character at your own speed. Where Monaco really shines is when you get 2-4 people together in co-op mode. Different characters' abilities complement each other in surprising ways, and strategies emerge that simply aren't possible in solo play. Figuring out how to combine different characters' abilities to meet the unique challenges that each level presents is half the fun. If you don't have Steam friends to play with, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the Monaco community. This is a group that really likes to cooperate, and is patient with new players. The patient, cooperative play style of Monaco appeals to more mature gamers, and the public community really reflects that.I enthusiastically recommend Monaco. It’s a blast. ",168,51,2,18,21,2,22

												4/5More fun than a boat full of criminals.Monaco is a hide and stealth type heist game.  There are 8 characters to choose from, all with their own skills.  You spend your time sneaking around guards, hacking computers, opening vaults and stealing assets.Fun story, Lots of levels!  you can even make your own and upload them for others to play.Single player is challanging and fun.  Multi-player can range from ""Epic"" to ""All hell has broken loose"".  If you buy the game, you have to try multi-player at least once. It is so much fun, and has a great voice chat system.There is a Zombie mode as well...Monaco is one of those games I would buy for all of my friends to enjoy.			",114,32,2,19,26,3,14

												Summary: Heist simulator 2013Multiplayer: 4Completion: 5 hrsCards: YesCloud: YesWhen you were a kid, were you ever dragged to a social gathering and had nothing fun to do there? Monaco is the game I wish I had when I was growing up and taken to play party games with other people.In Monaco you assemble a team of specialized thieves intent on stealing goods and getting away with it. You have very limited tools to handle opposition, so you must stealth your way to the goods, grab it, and run like hell. It's pretty much as it sounds.The graphics have a rather simplistic look. They're serviceable, though the saturated palette can make it hard to see things, and is sometimes hard on the eyes. Music is also serviceable. It goes for a sort of ragtime feel, like watching a black and white film.Gameplay involves a top-down view of the area, much like looking at a blueprint, with security guards whose attention span could give MGS Genome Soldiers a run for their money. Electronic traps and security cameras also seek to alert your presence, but you can disable these should you find their terminal.If there's one thing Monaco does well, its promote teamwork. The character roles are so different and specialized that the more people you have the better your chances are of pulling this off... provided you work together.If there's one thing I would like to add to the game, it's having AI party members. I can't always get a party of four, and so I would like to have some meatshiel- I mean scapegoa- I mean accomplices to assist me in my solo capers.While Monaco isn't the kind of game I would replay for days on end, it does make a fantastic occasional party game. Sure beats playing most board games. I give Monaco a 7.5/10 Thanks spleeno!			",535,252,19,112,46,6,135

												There aren't many servers out there but it shouldn't be a problem if you play with friends. It requires coordination with your team mates since punishment can be dealt out of spite because of one player. Overall, I think it's a game that pushes you to be versatile in many situation since a veteran has the same risk of dying as a new player. It's a great game.			",39,6,0,4,3,0,1

												I love this frickin' game. It's important to note that there are a number of ways to play each level. Whether you want to go stealthy or barrel through for the intent of beating a time score, you will never be bored. It is a lot more fun to actually play than it may be to watch, however (as my friends may attest). As I was learning the game I found that every round I was in I discovered a new subtlety to the mechanics. It may get easier but it never gets boring. Easily enjoyed with people from all around the world.Crime is its own language. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably one of the most original, unique, and fun games I've played all year. If you like games like Payday, or if you're that one guy with pickpocketing level 100 in Skyrim, get this game! It is filled with stealth missions in which you infiltrate different areas and steal things, and ultimately makes you feel like a ninja. It is a frantic, class based, strategy game that never get's old. But this game really shines when you're playing with up to 4 friends. The crazy combat and funny dialogue will make you and your friends want to keep playing for hours. And given the low price, you have no reason not to buy it.			",51,7,0,4,1,0,1

												A top-down retro-styled thief 'em up, Monaco has a delightful soundtrack and makes a fun co-op game with the right people. By yourself you may find yourself playing far more cautiously and conservatively, fully exploiting the bag of tricks provided to you, but Monaco is at its most fun with 3 friends played as a hectic anything goes heist.Difficulty curve for solo players may provide quite steep at times, especially the need to 'clear out' levels to advance the more interesting plot (which is well worth exploring right to the end to fully appreciate the whole story), while co-op with randoms is, as expected, a hit-or-miss experience.

It's great as a stealth game when you're playing it single player, but the game is at its apex in multiplayer, when the various classes are able to combine their efforts to maximize progress. The art style is very stylized, so be vigilant of your character to prevent losing yourself in the map. All I could ask for is a sequel sometime soon..and maybe a more violent class than Cleaner. :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can just go absolutely nuts playing this together with friends, with a load of maniacal things happening, even if you're just screwing around or playing the normal story mode! The variety of characters you can play as are incredibly fun to play with The Gentleman if you want to be stealthy, The Pickpocket if you just want to hoard money, The Hacker for taking out security systems, The Mole for taking those irritating walls(who needs walls anyway? :D), The Lockpick for quick break-ins, The Lookout for a better view of what you're up against, The Redhead for getting those random cops to fall for you, and The Cleaner for silent knockouts...

Using each player unique abilities to their full potential, while working together is priceless!So what am I saying?  GET THE GAME!

												There is honor among thieves in Monaco. That is, until you want what they have. Witness the story of eight skilled criminals as you take part in each step of every heist leading to the thrilling conclusion. Challange yourself to solo play, or take up to a party of four, weaving around sensors and guards in search for the ever longed for rewards on each stage.Each map can be played completely differently every time depending on number of members, classes, and paths taken. Take the ultimate challenge in the alternate storyline and avoid being knocked out.Help your fellow criminals pull off the heist of a lifetime, but remember, when it all comes down to it, what's yours is mine.

												Monaco is a action, stealth, and strategy heist game, where in every level you are passing through high-tech security to find the item you are looking for.Pros:-Very unique characters-The jazz piano is unrivaled-The storyline is excellent-Barely any bugs or glitches-I like the very unique pixel graphicsCons:-The only con I would have to say for this game is the repetitiveness in the game.

												Monaco ~A Short Review with no spoliers~I absolutely fell in love with this game the moment I began.The bright colors contrasted against the dark background, the fun music, and the multiplayer environment made for a terrifically fun experience.I played this game with another person,and by doing so, I feel that I got the most of the game, and thus I would recommend playing this with two or more people.Multiple playable characters, each with their own special abilities, are unlocked through a driving story line of criminal behavior -which was executed with the perfect balance of elements. This game was not as serious of a heist game as Payday 2, but it was not what I'd consider a “kiddy game”.When you assemble a team of the right characters for the mission at hand there's no way you can fail - that is unless you are me and my friends.Though you can fail multiple times, the fun never ends, at least it didn't for me. Each play through is different in itsownunique way, even though the layout of the levels is the same.Changing your characters may help if you fail a few times in a row.But when you just beat a level, it's not over. You can go back and try to “complete” the level, picking up every coin and every trophy. There's so much to do in this game, and that's why I love it.I didn't have a single complaint about the game with the catchy music and bright colors. I rate it 5/5, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys multiplayer heists.			",59,10,0,4,3,0,3

												This is my first review, and I've been a member of Steam for 4 years, so hopefully that tells you something.I bought this during the 2014 Summer sale, and have found it to be a great puzzle/heist game.Graphics:To start, if you have no desire for pixel and the retro look, then I would stop now. If you are not someone who NEEDS the incredible realism graphic engine, then you should be fine. The game gives you a couple of options for colors, but I found that the enhanced version was beautiful. The colors and shading/lighting make an awesome combination and really brings the game to life quickly. And it's not so much that it burns into your eyes either, so there's that.Audio:The music alone was awesome. I felt it was a rag-timey, pink panthery, mash up. Some of the songs had a great variation to some classic heist/jazz music that I thoroughly enjoyed. If you don't like, you can always turn off the music, but I felt it really added to the overall theme. When you almost get caught be a guard, the music changes to a faster tempo, trying to add to the suspense. It really felt more like a silent movie, where music was all you could really go off of for the tonality of the play.The sound effects were decent, there's not too much needed here.Gameplay:When I first started playing, I was lucky enough to have a few randoms in the lobby that were also new, but good spirited, so that definitely helped with the initial play through. But I will say it was a little difficult to start up and play at first, but that's my own impatience. The tutorial is actually part of the story, and if you have the patience to go and read all of it, it's actually pretty good. (I went back and read it, cause I'm typically very impatient and just want to play). Each character has their own special ability and it really does make a difference for each level. The strategy and puzzle of it comes from trying to figure out how to get by without getting caught; and if caught, trying to get away and hide. Sure, you could just run through, and try and out race the police, but the challenge is absolutely offered.  I've played with a group and solo, and found that it's WAY easier and ABSOLUTELY more fun with a group, if you can find one.All in all, I'd give the game somewhere between an 9/10. I only marked it down for two reasons: The pixel art is retro, and I get that, but a few more pixels, or less, on the police would make it more clear who they are. Could just be me, but I get a little confused about who I can and can't talk to. And (this isn't the game's fault) it's been a little difficult for me to find people to play with online.Hope this helps, happy gaming!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is a surprise for me. I didn't have any thoughts about the game before buying it. And when I play the game, I see that the execution of the ideas is wonderful. I like to play games that offer you to accomplish tasks in stealth. This game offers variety of options to achieve that. And doing that in a good way. Thanks to the optimized difficulty and map design, you are not going to get frustrated. I highly reccommend this game to anyone willing to play online or solo. Overall it is a great game.

												Great game! Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is one which has had me spending hours at a time beating the crap out of gendarme, smoking the heck out of innocent(but nonetheless annoying) civilians, and pushing about the mangled corpses of security guards. Monaco really allows one to explore different gameplay methods and tactics when it comes to taking on the challenges each level sets for you. Wonderful music from wonderful singers, and the art style never gets boring. Multiplayer is also excellent when playing with friends, the system is very easy to understand and use. Sadly, there are hardly any players to play with via multiplayer. Monaco has also taught me quite some bit of french. J'aime le français!8/10			",140,41,6,18,8,3,7

												Break into the building, steal the things, and get out without raising the alarm. Sounds mediocre, right? WRONG. Monaco is a fantastic game, and that fact become clear immediately upon starting up. The gameplay is much like what I just described, but with a style all its own that I cannot say I have ever seen in anything else. It's totally unique, and that style pervades every element of Monaco. The music and artwork truly shine (This is one of the few indie soundtracks that I went out and bought, to bring credence to that fact.)Alone, it's great fun, but the developers had the foresight to add in a multiplayer co-op mode- this instantly pushed a good game to great. The online chaos that may ensue, or the local co-op  madness (If you have spare controllers or keyboards) are nearly reminiscent of the great Nintendo multiplayer experiences of yore. So, if you have the money to spend, get this. You won't regret it.			",81,28,5,12,13,0,14

												Superb music, vibrant colors, and superb gameplay makes Monaco one of the best indie games i've played in 2013. Multiple classes, and the ability to play as any of them to clear a level,  adds replayability as you try to beat the clock or clear all the loot on each level. Monaco's multiplayer makes it even greater. The game is hectic as everyone tries to combine their individual skills to complete the game. While it's online multiplayer isn't the liveliest, the local co-op allows your for your friends and families to easily join in the fun. In short, this game is a real gem. ",248,62,3,38,26,4,39

												Co-op: A small learning curve, as teaching new players the abilities of every single player can get difficult. Once passed the learning curve, playing with your friends is fantastic. There are plenty of different ways to play the game, as the class system is well balanced.Single Player: The story line is very entertaining, despite just being dialog before the beginning of each level. One of the classes becomes obviously the best class to use during single player, and therefore game play can get repetitive.Visuals: The visuals for this game are tied together nicely. Everything is very consistent, and is sufficient to communicate game mechanics.Audio: The soundtrack for this game is fantastic, putting you in the middle of the bank heist at the right times, and matching your sneaking patterns just when you need it. The sound effects can be key when playing single player, as they will help you determine nearby enemies.Replayability*: I found I could get a solid 6 hours out of this game in one session for 6 days straight before I found myself getting bored at times. I could remedy this by switch classes, and that would last me a couple more days.Point where I'd say you have to buy it: $7*This varies A LOT from person to person, so only rely on this category from me if you've agreed with my other reviews' replayability sections.

												Great game! Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is one which has had me spending hours at a time beating the crap out of gendarme, smoking the heck out of innocent(but nonetheless annoying) civilians, and pushing about the mangled corpses of security guards. Monaco really allows one to explore different gameplay methods and tactics when it comes to taking on the challenges each level sets for you. Wonderful music from wonderful singers, and the art style never gets boring. Multiplayer is also excellent when playing with friends, the system is very easy to understand and use. Sadly, there are hardly any players to play with via multiplayer. Monaco has also taught me quite some bit of french. J'aime le français!8/10			",140,41,6,18,8,3,7

												I was part of the core group of beta testers for this game and even have my name appearing in its credits. I invested dozens of hours into the work-in-progress version of the game and thoroughly enjoyed it. The premise is theft - and you can choose from a handful of different character classes that all possess unique abilities to to pull off a successful theft (the ability to smash through walls, hack into security systems, assassinate guards, pose as guards and more). The game affords for hilarious, whimsical encounters as one progresses through a map collecting treasures that all play into a single narrative or over-arching storyline. If you are a fan of robbery/theft films and games, you'll enjoy Monaco.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My new favorite stealth game. This game has atmosphere out the wazoo and the rock-solid gameplay to keep you coming back even after that wears off. In that sense, it's a lot like Hotline Miami. The classes all feel different, but you could use any combination and still pull off a mission.The music is PERFECT. Stealth music instantly and seamlessly transitions to chase music the second you're discovered, which is simply a joy from a visceral and gameplay perspective.I could go on about this game forever. Buy it! Highly recommended!!!			",590,167,10,85,43,4,95

												Was cool for a while. I put 15 hours into it because over the years I kept reinstalling it and having to redo all the missions. It is fun and not very hard playing alone until you get to a massive difficulty spike in the next to last thief mission where it is strikingly apparant that this game was meant to mainly be a co-op/multiplayer game. In which you won't find anyone to connect to online because it's so old, so either search the forums for someone to play with or have a friend that also has the game. Also, if you do play co-op or mp, voice chat is basically a must. Without voice communication to closely work together, it will be a mess. I mean missions are certainly doable just fine without it but the game is a much, much more fun experience if you can communicate with voice.6/10 okay for a while			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												Monaco is a great looking artsy game with a great concept and, to a certain extent, this concept works out very well. More in singleplayer than multiplayer. Think of Monaco as a 1-4 player(s) Pacman-like heist game; collect as many coins as you can, grab some loot and then make a run for it. Sounds great, doesn't it ? Yes, as a concept. In reality it could've been so much better. Let me try to explain.First of all, I've been waiting for this game to be released for a long time, and now that it has finally been released I can't help but feel disappointed. Why ? Because in co-op the game is just so damn hectic and it's hard to see your location or any location for that matter. There are no instructions on how to use your character and their abilities properly. You can see why that's distracting when you're playing with other people. Your partners have certain expectations and instead of actually helping you're running around making it look like you know what you're doing. But you actually don't know. People (including yourself) will ragequit because of this. They're unforgiving. Sure, not everyone, but a lot of my games have ended that way. Also, the AI is a bit random from time to time, so there's no right way to finish a level. You need a bit of strategy and also a whole lot of luck. One thing that could instantly make this game better is by simply increasing your field of vision, giving you a better sight while walking around, and giving you more of an idea on what to do next.The single-player mode is thankfully less hectic, but still doesn't really teach you how to use your abilities properly. In single-player you can't get resurrected (obviously) so, instead, you have a certain amount of lives. Die and you can't use that character anymore and this continues until you run out of characters (i.e. lives).Now, on the other hand, Monaco has more than enough content and some missions should take you over 30 minutes to finish. They can certainly be fun while playing with  a group of friends.This little review does make it look like I hate it, but I really don't. I truly like this game, I just wish it was better on certain fronts, or maybe a bit more open to get rid of the chaos entirely. Make sure you give it a spin if you have a group of friends who you can communicate with, that should certainly help.[Rating: 80/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Fun and entertaining game that is made even more enjoyable when played with friends. The vibrant colours and upbeat retro music makes the game not only appealing to the eyes, but the ears. The characters are original and unique. Gameplay gets abit repetitive yet still enjoyable throughout. Gameplay mechanics are decent, however the controls are abit clunky at times. Overall, I'd give it a strong 7.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very addictive. It's fun to play with your friends either online or in the same room as you. Monaco is a very simple game, but getting the gold coins can be tricky. I always have that sense of suspense when a guard sees me and I have to immediately figure out a way to hide. I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone.			",107,12,1,11,8,0,5

Way easier to understand the story and gameplay. That aside, this is a great game with well thought out mechanics.			",50,4,0,3,4,0,1

												One of the first Indie games that I can honestly say I enjoy.  Interesting gameplay that provides challenge on a number of levels.  So amazingly fun to play with others.  Not really fun to play alone, but there is a good way to easily match up with others in public lobbies.  Has in-game voice chat for communication, which is absolutely necessary to do well.

												Fun and entertaining game that is made even more enjoyable when played with friends. The vibrant colours and upbeat retro music makes the game not only appealing to the eyes, but the ears. The characters are original and unique. Gameplay gets abit repetitive yet still enjoyable throughout. Gameplay mechanics are decent, however the controls are abit clunky at times. Overall, I'd give it a strong 7.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, had much fun. Seems even when 'pubbing' you can play strategically just as well with your friends (which is more likely to be better, using voice chat). The map designs and workshop ability allows for fun packed gameplay for a long lasting time, and if you get bored... try a different class, most act differently to others as I found of playing as 'The Redhead' rather than my common 'Lookout' class. I really enjoyed the brief period of time I had on here, but overall it was a really fun game to pick up in the sales.			",116,14,4,13,34,2,28

This is the overall reason for me being shamwowed by the judges badonka donk after the part time security guards latched me to a subway car and sent me down to the station. Monaco is a fantasmic game about litterally stealing from every place robbers shouldn't be stealing from; Hospitals, Embassies, and even hotels. The creators of this game are hands down the smartest people on this planet, because I would have never thought to rob a hospital for a quick buck. 10/10 would rob again.			",62,4,0,3,5,0,5

												An absolutely fantastic game to play locally with 3 of your friends, though I can't quite get my head around why one of us was forced to use a keyboard and mouse rather than a 4th controller. The game's biggest strength is its simplicity; you get your choice of 4 characters (8 by the end) and each has one distinct function, with perhaps one other side function. You take your little team through numerous 3 or 4 level stages and try to steal as much stuff as you can, as fast as you can, while trying not to be seen. We were incredibly bad at it but still managed to finish the main campaign and have 12 hours of fun on a lazy Sunday doing it.Also, you revive your teammates by pressing against their dead bodies while your character makes a bunch of slurping noises. Just saying.			",2087,758,56,251,223,20,316

												I think the biggest issue this game has is getting people to give it a try due to the graphics. Even though the graphics give off that old 8-bit atari feel, it feels nothing like it. Try to imagine a stealth game like theif in a more retro setting, and then add three other players plus lots of awesomeness. While it can be played single player, this game thrives as a team stealth game. In terms of content Monaco has more than enough to keep you busy for months. There are tons of levels, each taking anywhere from 10-20 min on average, and even after you beat all the levels you can try the levels with different character combinations. Each character having it's own unique ability that helps your team in it's own unique way.Truley an amazingly fun and challenging game, if you already have a group of friends you game with, this is definitly a game worth getting.

												Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is heck of a fun little game.  It follows the story of four (and later more) bandits on their quest to flee the country.  How?  By doing what they do best, stealing and thievin'.  It has very unique art style, in pixelatted goodness, and uses a top-down view, which allows you for better planning in the heists you will be making.  The game has you select different characters to pull these off.  Each character has its own assets and they are all very unique.  You will need to use their different abilities to collect money and other collectibles and complete a variety of missions.  You can play this game offline or with friends in a four player online co-op game, which is the has its assets and its disadvantages.  Alone you only have the benefits of a single character skill, but you are less likely to be caught, so the way you play really suits your style.  It has a great number of missions in the main campaign, to which is added another campaign of harder difficulty, PvP maps where you can duke it out against others online to see who can collect the most treasure or kill the opponent(s) first, to which are added other levels that explain the origins of the characters through score-attack like levels.  The game can even be played in whole in ""Zombie mode"", where the whole game has not only a zombie skin change, but the characters have different abilities too.  And finally, the integration of custom maps made by the users only make Monaco a potential source of infinite fun.  I highly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Committing crime has never been so much fun (and safe) as it is in Monaco! Unless you die and then you have to be revived by a teammate if that's possible at the time. Nevertheless, this game is definitely worth it and playing online with others as you craft a strategy is even more enjoyable. Monaco FTW! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game because it was on sale and looked fairly unique, but I wasn't expecting very much. I was wrong. This game is one of the best buys I've made during my time on steam. The trailer's don't necessarily do the graphics justice, which have really clear visuals, and a minimalistic, but aesthetically pleasing neon art style. The soundtrack is also killer, capturing the perfect tone. The gameplay is fantastic, akin to pacman with stealth, guns, and laser-rigged security systems. There is little in the way of tutorial, so you are left to experiment for yourself,but that works well for this for this game, which has you balance careful planning, against quick thinking and resourcefulness for when things go wrong. The plot was also pretty fresh, while nodding to tropes within the heist genre. The game offers a lot of replayability too, as though the single player is fun and carries the game by itself, the multiplayer enables you to play with others to try and try to grab everything and get out as fast as possible. In addition to this, the community is pretty good, and new levels are often being made. Of course, no game is perfect, and if I had to say something, it would be that though the plot was great, it was advanced sparingly from mission to mission. If story is what you look for in a game, this may not be the game for you. Also, although you don't have to collect every coin to ""win"" a mission, if the coins are ignored some missions lose a lot of challenge, especially as on some earlier missions the number of lives you have is fairly generous. However, there are a lot of levels (3 parallel campaigns, with a 4th coming out soon, as well as zombie mode), so this would only bother those exceptionally impatient people who can't wait to unlock the later levels, which are extraordinarily challenging, even if you don't collect the coins!I would definitely give this game a 10/10 as it stands, and am very excited to play the new content which is coming out this year			",95,31,0,13,4,1,12

												Don't know why, but there's something about a good heist. When I first heard about this game it instantly spoke to me. It has charm, humor, uniquw classes, and an interesting soundtrack. While it can be played alone, the game really shines when played with people. It's really fun how one moment everyone is performing their role (picking locks, scouting enemy locations, silently taking guards out, etc), then all of a sudden someone fumbles...the music changes...and then it's utter chaos with everyone running in around scrambling to escape and survive.

												This is a really good game.  It's a top down sneak game with a wide array of characters to choose from.  You play a few levels and it's really easy, and you think ""oh, this'll be an easy 100%.""Wrong.  There are over 30 levels to complete, and about halfway it starts to ramp up the difficulty.  Guards are everywhere, lasers are everywhere, trip lasers are everywhere, and then later all the lasers have shotguns on them (not kidding.)  Towards the end the difficulty is ramped up so high it's just brutal.But it's a good kind of difficulty.  You can't just barrel your way through the game and then get mad when it punishes you.  If you take things slow, plan out your course of action, then even the hardest levels are posssible.8/10There are some sneak elements that're missing but overall a very satisfying game.

												Excerpt from the handbook of The Security Professionals Association of Monaco:""Dear future security officer, congratulations on choosing one of today's most exciting career opportunities in the Principality of Monaco. You are about to embark on an adventure unlike any other: guarding the wealth of some of the most powerful and famous people on the planet. Here are some useful guidelines to performing your job at the level of excellence and thoroughness that our customers have come to expect of us:- If you should face the possibility of dealing with an intruder, take a few seconds to make extra sure that it wasn't nothing. It was probably nothing.- If you are absolutely certain that you have spotted an intruder, but then lose track, don't feel too bad, somebody else has probably taken care of it.- If you should suddenly remember being in a firefight and losing sight of intruders mere moments ago - calm down. Go back to your post, and if you should see something again: remember rule #1.- Now for the most important rule: potted plants are sacred and must never be disturbed or looked at.- Do you think you saw somebody walk behind a potted plant? Maybe even four people? Do you think that you could find out for sure if you just, you know, looked at the plant? WELL TOUGH LUCK, DUMBASS, YOU HAD BETTER MADE ABSOLUTELY SURE FIRST SO GO BACK AND DO YOUR DUTY.- Somebody tried to hide behind a potted plant while you were in a firefight and you're absolutely 100% completely sure he is still there? FINE. SHOOT AT THE PLANT. See how you feel about it when we cut your paycheck, vacation and transfer you to guarding the basement toilets for the next 30 years, PLANTKILLER.- Also sacred? VENTS. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT MESS WITH THE VENTS. If an intruder is going inside a vent, DO NOT PURSUE. DO NOT SHOOT AT THE VENT. Do you know how to fix a vent? Cause I sure don't. SO DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING CAUSE ALL OF US TO SUFFOCATE BECAUSE YOU HAD TO PLAY THE HERO.- Finally, if you happen to shoot an intruder, do. not. touch. the. body. You probably didn't attend any biology classes so allow me to break it down for you: dead bodies carry HORRIBLE TERRIBLE DISEASES. Leave them exactly where they drop and return to your station immediately. Somebody better equipped to handle the situation than your plant-killing vent-shooting♥♥♥♥♥is surely going to come and take care of it. We have found that bodies have a tendency to disappear more quickly when left unattended.With these simple guidelines you should have a blast in your new job! In light of recent unexpected mortality spikes we hope that you understand that we had to revoke all life insurance policies for new employees.""[[On a more serious note, if you have a bunch of friends to play then Monaco is a funny, challenging and surprisingly complex co-op heist game, featuring a nice soundtrack and multiple free expansions.]]			",199,113,0,28,13,0,18

Each of the characters brings unique abilities to the table, and all the variables in it make every replay of a map feel different. Plus they're adding a level editor as free DLC. Bombing, tunnelling, hacking, lockpicking, safecracking, chloroforming, disguising, stealing, flirting, dog-dodging fun!			",208,60,1,33,17,2,39

												If you enjoy 2D, retro-style games, you will love Monaco. It truly shines as a cooperative experience.You can go through most of the story completely solo (and at times it may be easier for some levels), and the game offers an offline/online feature that is very well integrated. Levels you have unlocked will have a marker indicating open lobby sessions, making it easier to join up for cooperative play. The steam workshop also has fantastic mods, including two CRITICAL tutorials that everyone should go through to get a good feel for the game. The jewel store from PAYDAY 2 is a particularly exciting one. Replayability just for these mods is endless.The aesthetics are great, and the fog of war mechanic is beautifully-executed: there will be a blueprint for each level (including floors), and you will only be able to see the details of your character's field of vision, the rest will remain gray. You can see nearby footsteps of your enemies, but require the Lookout character for constant enemy awareness. This makes for intense gameplay when you are in one area of the map and die, while your other teammates are on the other side, all running away from guards.The layout is still very friendly as your objectives will be indicated by large trophies on the map, and there usually be many signs on the ground to give you directions. The ""action"" timer is given by a small circle that fills up for everything you may have to do, from opening a window to unlocking a door so you can go into the urinal and pee (yes, there is an animation for peeing).The game incorporates an ""ammo"" system for whatever active item you have equipped (ex: C4, shotgun, smoke grenade, etc) that gives you +1 whenever you collect 10 of the yellow collectibles. While you share the total team score with your party at the end, your specific ammo count is individual, so you may have to decide who collects the resources if they are running low.Each character class comes with different skills and responsiblities, making for very diverse gameplay (and high replayability).Very charming cooperative (initally) game. (There are PvP modes lol)			",250,87,0,51,38,2,49

												The real gem in my game library. Monaco is a co-op heist game with 4 players just like PAYDAY (btw there're some PAYDAY maps available to play in the workshop). Like I said, my favorite part in the game is Community made levels (my favorite is PAYDAY maps). Sure the original campaign is good, but the community made maps have a lot of detailed hand crafted game mechanism. So why aren't you buying this?! go ahead buy the game without hestitate!

												I love this game because of the many ways to play, beyond just the 8 characters. You can try to stay hidden the entire heist, or burst into a ball of flaming rage while you kill everyone on the level. Either way, it makes for a fun and fast-pased game with so many little ""tricks"", such as secret passages, unmentioned abilities, and even just the variation of time it take to collect a certain ""loot container"" (safe, jewelry case, ATM, stack of cash, etc.). The top-down perspective gives the game a very unique style, especially since this top-down format is being used with a game full of action and stealth. And even though the Guardarme are tough, every level is very possible to beat, as long as you take the right paths, hide in the right bushes, and have the perfect balance of secrecy and lethality.

Posted: June 23, 2014
												So earlier on in the spring, I purchased Monaco for 4 dollars because I needed a break from Skyrim. It is one of those rare indy games that comes around that realizes the best way to reward a player is by cleverness rather than trial and error. It's a game of actual skill and challenge rather than merely repetition and memorization. If I'd known how good it was going to be, I would have bought it at full price.Monaco is a stealth co-op game where you play a team of 8 thieves in vibrant colors. Together, they work to pull off a heist at Monte Carlo, the largest casino in the world. The world takes place in the actual city of Monaco, which has been stylized in a sort of retro look. Oddly enough, the game actually resembles the city at night. Just an interesting side note there. Anyway, each of the 8 thieves has particular talents which are used to work together with other players. The objective in each mission is varieties of rescuing a team member, collect a bunch of trophies, or just try to make a quick getaway in the van.Technically, you do not need to play multiplayer to progress, but it's highly recommended for new players as Monaco is significantly easier with three extra pairs of hands. If you do desire to player it single player, I would recommend looking into some player made tutorial missions that'll tell you everything you need to know.If there's any kind of nitpicking I could have about Monaco, it's that combat is just a major waste of time(unless you are playing in Zombie Mode). When you pick up a gun, you only get one shot and it takes ten coins to get one extra shot of ammo. Most floors in a level have 50 coins on average and there's about 2-3 floors per level. That means you're looking at maybe 10 shots at best...unless you're playing in multiplayer. Only then do things get really antagonistic as four thieves are competing for coins when cleaning out places.To top that off, even if you do collect all the coins on your own, you'll often find yourself outnumbered and outgunned by guards and civilians and they can all resurrect each other...so there's no real point to the weapons except to buy for more time. For some people who like the option of blasting through everyone who gets in their way, this may be a bit of a turnoff. I don't personally mind it however, because combat is not the focus of Monaco. It's about the caper, the chase, the theft. If you are looking for mindless slaughtering, check out the Zombie Mode. Zombie Mode makes you get twice as much ammo for the coins you collect and even gives the cleaner an one hit kill sneak attack.Complaints about combat aside, what makes a stealth co-op game like Monaco fun is that you're not scored based on how carefully you stealth. The truth of the matter is security gets so beefed up in the late game that even if you were the greatest cat burglar in the world, you're still eventually going to get caught. But that's part of what makes it so exciting when four thieves are running around like chickens with their heads cut off, collecting all the coins, dodging guards and turret fire while desperately trying to resurrect one another. It's the chaotic elements they add that make it stand out as a stealth game and once you get used to the mechanics on hiding and sneaking, then the game just starts to challenge you.One recommendation I would say if you choose to buy this is don't play this game for longer than 2 or 3 missions per day. Monaco is like a good wine--great for savouring but not so much for consuming. If you do power through it, the novelty will start to wear off fast and you'll just wind up burning out. There's enough enjoyment from getting 100% coins and no deaths with a competent team of friends in a single mission than teabagging every noob you see in a triple A shooter. It's a game that's all about quality over quantity.These reasons are all that what makes Monaco a game that totally deserves your attention because it's the indy game of early 2014 that most deserves to be played. They just finished up the last patch on it and it's available on steam for 5 bucks. So stop reading this, go to the store and buy this already. In the meantime, I have more time to play as the Gentleman. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whats yours is mine, and whats on offer here is a simple concept, done really well, provides a lot of entertainment, and is all about the multiplayer.  Monaco flys under the radar for a lot of people as it isn't a big name title, and doesnt pretend to be, but the number of different ways you can play the game using different characters with different skills mean there is no right or wrong way to get through the game, although inevitably people will find their own style of play.  Playing with friends is where this excels.  Those moments when someone gets caught and dies in a really stupid place full of laser beams and guards and then trying to come in with a plan to create enough of a distraction for someone to get in and revive them is so much fun.  If you dont have this and see it on offer for under  £2, buy a few copies for your mates, and it will easily repay it with the entertainment time it gives you back.			",342,126,37,44,31,5,55

												After viewing the trailer for this game I wasn't exactly sure what I thought, it looked like it would be fun or it could be a horrible clunky mess of a game. After taking a gamble on this game I was not disappointed. I have not played many top down stealth games which have run this smoothly or been this much fun. The story, as minimalist as it is, is surprisingly engaging as well. If you're a fan of local coop and like playing games in the same room as your friends this game should probably be on your shortlist of must haves.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Monaco showcases this in all of its glory, and makes being a spy feel so great. A multiplayer must. DON'T STEP ON CATS/BIRDS/TRIPWIRES/GUARDS.  Come, let us be bad spies together!

												Monaco is a 2D Stealth game where you have various objectives to complete while robbing places.It has style, a captivating soundtrack, but most of all, it's multiplayer fun.If anyone has ever played the old Hitman games (not absolution), they would immediately feel at home, the levels are big and the player is given total choice on how to handle everything, so you can say there are multiple choices to finish a level, defined by your creativity.For example, you have to infiltrate this big mansion, you can use the Mole to breach a wall and enter, you can use the Hacker to deactivate the cameras, you can use the Cleaner to put the enemies to sleep, and countless other strategies being viable even the ""Let's just rush in!!!""The only problem with that last strategy is that levels become harder and it's easier to die against automatic weapons and all of the security measures.All in all it's satisfying to pull off stunts and the game doesn't penalize you for it!Yes, the best thing about the score system,  if you're a completionist like me, you only have to collect all the coins and escape with no deaths.No ""No alarms"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, no ""No kills"" or other stuff like that, you can handle the level HOWEVER you want, which is always a plus, even if I usually try to not kill anybody or try not to be spotted, at least I know I can kill that guard that cornered without getting frustrated about ""losing points"".The game is NEVER frustrating so far, even if you die, you just wait for your teammates to get you back up and try a new approach.If you want to compete in the leaderboards, the only factors that counts is Time and Gold (because for every gold you miss you get a higher time), personally, I like to take things slow with my favourite class, the Gentleman (being the slowest class overall).Play with friends or strangers, it's always funny, even when no one communicates and everybody just roams the level to do their thing, collecting money mostly, and when all the coins have been taken, everyone proceeds to the next floor of that particular level.I really like this formula and recommend it to any stealth loving gamer.Have I mentioned it has an editor and steam workshop support? Which by the way, is easy to use.			",432,86,11,64,48,1,72

												Very fun game, alone or with friends. It's simple, yet complex at the same time- And each mission is unique, so you won't feel like you are repeating the same thing over and over again, and with each different class means a different way of finishing the mission! No matter your skill, It gets harder as you go along, so you're guaranteed to face a challenge at some point. As for faults, personally, if any, is going to have to be with Multiplayer. Anybody can join, beginners or advanced, so each time is different. But, it lacks challenge. A team-member can be reckless and set off all the guards and what not, or everyone can go off and do their own thing, and the mission can still be completed, I wish it could be more along the lines of, one wrong move and your entire mission will fail, hence forcing teamwork. Other than that, I'd give the game 4/5 stars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An absolutely fantastic game to play locally with 3 of your friends, though I can't quite get my head around why one of us was forced to use a keyboard and mouse rather than a 4th controller. The game's biggest strength is its simplicity; you get your choice of 4 characters (8 by the end) and each has one distinct function, with perhaps one other side function. You take your little team through numerous 3 or 4 level stages and try to steal as much stuff as you can, as fast as you can, while trying not to be seen. We were incredibly bad at it but still managed to finish the main campaign and have 12 hours of fun on a lazy Sunday doing it.Also, you revive your teammates by pressing against their dead bodies while your character makes a bunch of slurping noises. Just saying.			",2087,758,56,251,223,20,316

												An enjoyably arcadey take on the criminal genre that embraces a larger emphasis on stealth than PAYDAY, but a more forgiving view on alerting enemies than Thief. The game contains a ream of both developer and custom-made content, with full Steam Workshop support. Good alone, spectacular with friends.Positives:+ Extremely entertaining, fluid, yet challenging gameplay+ A selection of classes that genuinely change the way you play+ A fun, arcadey graphics style that communicates information effectively+ Seemingly endless content, with four campaigns and Steam Workshop support for user created levels+ An easily usable level editor, containing all of the tiles, objects and tools used in the game.+ Easily-hosted serversNegatives:- Occasional sever connectivity issues- A large difficulty spike between the Pickpocket's Story and Fin campaign.- Lack of checkpoints can prove an irritationRating: 83%			",91,14,2,15,17,0,22

												I love this game because of the many ways to play, beyond just the 8 characters. You can try to stay hidden the entire heist, or burst into a ball of flaming rage while you kill everyone on the level. Either way, it makes for a fun and fast-pased game with so many little ""tricks"", such as secret passages, unmentioned abilities, and even just the variation of time it take to collect a certain ""loot container"" (safe, jewelry case, ATM, stack of cash, etc.). The top-down perspective gives the game a very unique style, especially since this top-down format is being used with a game full of action and stealth. And even though the Guardarme are tough, every level is very possible to beat, as long as you take the right paths, hide in the right bushes, and have the perfect balance of secrecy and lethality.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine a game developed by Pocketwatch Games is an absolute masterpiece, I have been following this game since the day it was announced a couple of years back, and from the time I played it when it first came out to now, I must say that the game has really changed, adding more and more features into the game. Kinda reminds me of Thief but top-down and more comical than the dark Thief. An absolute masterpiece and at a very cheap price (Free Weekend) and best of all, it is best played with your friends!What's mine is yours, and Monaco is mine! RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In short, this game is about Heist. Get in, Rob, Get Out.It's long after I played Monaco with my friends (4 players Co-Op of course, that was a blast!)I decided to give a review, so apologize for any things I may forgot to mention below :By far, Monaco as an Indie game has great, solid, satisfying Coop experience. Team up with four players and break through buildings to sweep all shiny things you see. And four players can wreak havoc entire building, alerting every guards to chase you down. It's all the hilarous things popping out at every moment. One small misstep and the place will turn into chaos.Gameplay, Characters : You are a robber who steal stuffs in the city of Monaco. Like other heist games, this game requires avoiding guards patrolling here and there, stealing things, open doors, and hide in bushes. When played single player, this game have several lives which when the one you chose die, other characters show up to be picked again. So in total there are 8 characters, meaning you have 8 lives to do the single player campaign (Which I will say quite easy to do just a run, but not when doing a perfect one). Multiplayer, this is where the fun comes from. Up to four players, at the same time sneaking into a building filled with psychopath guards (there're psycho doctors too, hope this game doesn't change your perception), lasers, and... if I remember correctly, there are cats and dogs too, meowing and barking to alert the psychos. Four players, I have to admit, is less strategic than single player, if not pre-planned first. One player can cause havoc in one section, while others, panicking by the alerts, cause much more chaos and the whole place is about hit & run till you cut off from the guard's sight or die. And that's where the fun lies, saving your dead friend while being chased and shot by guards.Characters, there are 8 total characters to play with, 4 starting characters each with unique abilities. One can open locks fast, one can seek out guards on the map, one can loot coins automatically, and else. They're fun in their own ways.Controls, Mechanics, AIs : Pretty solid, and simple controls to handle. Only WASD to move and a mouse to aim & shoot the baddies along the way. Weapons are also fun to play with, shotgun can kill multiple enemies, a bomb can blow up a place in certain radius, health kit can restore half of your life upon use, and tranquilizer to make enemies sleep. Mechanics are pretty good and well-thought. You can plan a whole stealthy, sneaky robbery, or do an all-out rampage, taking everything in the path while escaping as soon as possible. AIs are also creative, chasing you down all the way until you die, or you can sneak behind them, leaving question marks along the way.Levels, Difficulties, Maps : Very creative, and the levels are designed in a way that you might be involved in a heist film. Hide into a bush, getting sneaky, turn off the lasers and lights. There are so many things to play with before the robbery happens and the grand escape begins. Difficulty-wise, the pacing is perfect for a heist game. While I did have to retry a few times at the first act, after knowing the mechanics of the AI, the rest of the act is about executing and improving your heist skills.Story : I didn't read the story though, I skipped all the dialogues, so yeah I'll skip this one. But it's quite interesting and easy to pick-up.Music : Loved the theme song, and the Discotheque Rouge (If I'm not wrong) level. Musics are catchy like actual heist movies, and they are French-themed, so they're unique in French ways. Cons : So far haven't found any cons, only that the difficulty curve at the start is probably a bit high (I haven't played any heist games, so that should be counted as a factor too)Tl;dr, get this game with your other 3 friends. Break into buildings, one by one and make chaos all over Monaco! 100% Fun and laughter guaranteed!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Each of the characters brings unique abilities to the table, and all the variables in it make every replay of a map feel different. Plus they're adding a level editor as free DLC. Bombing, tunnelling, hacking, lockpicking, safecracking, chloroforming, disguising, stealing, flirting, dog-dodging fun!			",208,60,1,33,17,2,39

												This is a really good game.  It's a top down sneak game with a wide array of characters to choose from.  You play a few levels and it's really easy, and you think ""oh, this'll be an easy 100%.""Wrong.  There are over 30 levels to complete, and about halfway it starts to ramp up the difficulty.  Guards are everywhere, lasers are everywhere, trip lasers are everywhere, and then later all the lasers have shotguns on them (not kidding.)  Towards the end the difficulty is ramped up so high it's just brutal.But it's a good kind of difficulty.  You can't just barrel your way through the game and then get mad when it punishes you.  If you take things slow, plan out your course of action, then even the hardest levels are posssible.8/10There are some sneak elements that're missing but overall a very satisfying game.

With an amazing over-head 8-bit style it feels wierdly realistic as only what your character can see is revealed on the map. You can play as 8 classes, each with their own special abilities.

												What can I say. This game is a fun co-op puzzle game. It reminds me of Bonanzo Brothers, an old game from back in the day. Basically everyone is working together to steal something, and then make a get away. Each class brings something unique to the table. The story is great. What this game excels at though is the casual fun that is to be had with friends.			",49,2,2,2,1,1,2

												Monaco is a top-down heist game where you choose one of four characters (with an additional four unlocked as the story progresses), break out of prison, and then with the help of the mysterious Gentleman, attempt to flee Monaco. The story is in two parts, first told from the perspective of the Locksmith over 17 levels, then retold by the Pickpocket in another 16. There's also a level builder, and you can download new levels to play in the Steam community workshop.I'd call this a Stealth game, but the stealth often decays into a mad dash to run out of sight of enemies or to make a mad dash away from the C4 you just placed to blow open a safe or wall or security guard. The background music is reminiscent of ragtime piano, and changes to suit the situation if you're spotted or set off alarms.It's good in single-player, but where Monaco truly shines is 4-player co-op.I've very much enjoyed this game, and it's on sale (50% off) at the moment. Go buy this game, because it's great. :3			",442,146,7,68,44,2,65

												What a great investment. I expected kind of an action puzzle game but the game is far more than this. The whole setting is very atmospheric, prison break, bank heist, rescueing a fellow criminal from a mansion. There are so many things to interact with like light barriers, vents, computers to hack in, the breaker box in the wine cellar and of course the guards that are animated sooo funny. If this wasn't enough, you get kind of a gangster movie soundtrack of the silent film age. It fits perfectly! Everything in this games fits. The multiplayer matches with friends are awesome. The best experience is sitting in a room and hear everybody screaming when the alarm at the museum you're robbing goes off. You have to buy this game and play it hard. Hopefully it's cheaper on christmas holidays (steam plz :D) so we get more good players online.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun and challenging game, with a nicely balanced difficulty curve. I'm my opinion, it's best in Co-op and it's available both local and online. The latter is a nice way to meet other players and build strong (ish) teams to clear out those rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s's floors. Of course that implies sneaking, breaking vaults with laser tourettes poiting straight at you and being synchronized with the people you rely on saving your butt by cutting off the power, hacking through computers, breaking through walls, disguising  and even ""cleaning"" or seducing the guards and civilians. You may need to be revived too, so for the sake of your team mates, please don't die in a laser room or in front of a guard. The bushes are your friends and those smoke bombs are going to save your♥♥♥♥♥many times. The top-down view presenting the architectural plans of the floor are very accurate and easily navigable by the players. I give this game a 9/10, it's definitely worth it's money for many fun hours at a time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I cannot say enough praise for this game. Not only do I enjoy it, I recommend it to everyone I know. Most games get boring after you beat them, but Monaco just stays fun by allowing you to try it different ways, with different characters, making it a game you can play multiple times. And multiplayer is great (assuming no one lags too badly) since you can have more fun, knowing that someone's got your back. Even the story is great, as I was truly enthralled in it. As of right now, I'm working on the achievments, which have never felt more rewarding. I cannot recommend this enough.			",31,8,0,7,11,0,7

												Indie games like this can be easily described as having basic and inviting graphics, mixed with well tuned and well thought out gameplay. Monaco showcases this in all of its glory, and makes being a spy feel so great. A multiplayer must. DON'T STEP ON CATS/BIRDS/TRIPWIRES/GUARDS.  Come, let us be bad spies together!

												So earlier on in the spring, I purchased Monaco for 4 dollars because I needed a break from Skyrim. It is one of those rare indy games that comes around that realizes the best way to reward a player is by cleverness rather than trial and error. It's a game of actual skill and challenge rather than merely repetition and memorization. If I'd known how good it was going to be, I would have bought it at full price.Monaco is a stealth co-op game where you play a team of 8 thieves in vibrant colors. Together, they work to pull off a heist at Monte Carlo, the largest casino in the world. The world takes place in the actual city of Monaco, which has been stylized in a sort of retro look. Oddly enough, the game actually resembles the city at night. Just an interesting side note there. Anyway, each of the 8 thieves has particular talents which are used to work together with other players. The objective in each mission is varieties of rescuing a team member, collect a bunch of trophies, or just try to make a quick getaway in the van.Technically, you do not need to play multiplayer to progress, but it's highly recommended for new players as Monaco is significantly easier with three extra pairs of hands. If you do desire to player it single player, I would recommend looking into some player made tutorial missions that'll tell you everything you need to know.If there's any kind of nitpicking I could have about Monaco, it's that combat is just a major waste of time(unless you are playing in Zombie Mode). When you pick up a gun, you only get one shot and it takes ten coins to get one extra shot of ammo. Most floors in a level have 50 coins on average and there's about 2-3 floors per level. That means you're looking at maybe 10 shots at best...unless you're playing in multiplayer. Only then do things get really antagonistic as four thieves are competing for coins when cleaning out places.To top that off, even if you do collect all the coins on your own, you'll often find yourself outnumbered and outgunned by guards and civilians and they can all resurrect each other...so there's no real point to the weapons except to buy for more time. For some people who like the option of blasting through everyone who gets in their way, this may be a bit of a turnoff. I don't personally mind it however, because combat is not the focus of Monaco. It's about the caper, the chase, the theft. If you are looking for mindless slaughtering, check out the Zombie Mode. Zombie Mode makes you get twice as much ammo for the coins you collect and even gives the cleaner an one hit kill sneak attack.Complaints about combat aside, what makes a stealth co-op game like Monaco fun is that you're not scored based on how carefully you stealth. The truth of the matter is security gets so beefed up in the late game that even if you were the greatest cat burglar in the world, you're still eventually going to get caught. But that's part of what makes it so exciting when four thieves are running around like chickens with their heads cut off, collecting all the coins, dodging guards and turret fire while desperately trying to resurrect one another. It's the chaotic elements they add that make it stand out as a stealth game and once you get used to the mechanics on hiding and sneaking, then the game just starts to challenge you.One recommendation I would say if you choose to buy this is don't play this game for longer than 2 or 3 missions per day. Monaco is like a good wine--great for savouring but not so much for consuming. If you do power through it, the novelty will start to wear off fast and you'll just wind up burning out. There's enough enjoyment from getting 100% coins and no deaths with a competent team of friends in a single mission than teabagging every noob you see in a triple A shooter. It's a game that's all about quality over quantity.These reasons are all that what makes Monaco a game that totally deserves your attention because it's the indy game of early 2014 that most deserves to be played. They just finished up the last patch on it and it's available on steam for 5 bucks. So stop reading this, go to the store and buy this already. In the meantime, I have more time to play as the Gentleman. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is an incredibly varied game with very simple game mechanism. It’s actually quite staggering with how much you can get done and nuanceful (that’s a real word I am sure) your game play can be with so few commands at your disposal. It’s nothing short of brilliant. It also makes its very approachable and in all probability resulted in 8 different character classes rather than one multitalented one and too, is very cool since it opens up a nice setting for very fun multiplayer games that rely heavily on co-op to get things done efficiently. And with a game play as smooth as Monaco's it really is a treat!So what type of game is it? It’s a stealth action planning coop game where you collect treasure, whack out baddies and hide in the bushes. Occasionally when things go wrong and might have to put the shotgun on the table and some cleaning. The game has a top down view, you have a field of vision (opponents too) and you can see most of the buildings layoutes once you have explored them. You move around with arrow keys and with the help of different character you can go through walls, pick locks or hack computers etc. Your goal is get through security and fine the ""cake"". For me it’s the coop that really shines since you can have your buddies set up different scenarios or organize traps for the baddies and it’s just a lot of fun.  It’s also the type of game you can easily play with your girlfriend!9/10 in my book. ",536,158,36,44,48,7,108

												Monaco: A really well-rounded stealth game.The game follows the lives of a band of criminals in Monaco. Main story points are made at the beginning of each level, so don't just skip straight past it on your first play through.The gameplay is very good and it is well balanced between the Stealthy parts and the parts that may require a more brute force approach. There is also a wealth of tools for you to use whihc lets you customize your gameplay to whichever style you prefer.The control scheme works very well, I have tested with a controller & keyboard/mouse. The levels in-game give a good explanation of how to use the controls.There is a surprising amount of detail in the environments, given that it's a 2D top down pixel style. Worthy of note is the lighting algorithm, which limits your line of view depending on where you are in a level.The sound and music involved are very good. Not too over the top, and it suits the stealth aspect of the game very well.There is a wide array of workshop content, and included is a simple & easy to use level editor.I have not yet tested the multiplayer or the pvp aspect of the game, so I cannot comment on it.While playing this game I found no major bugs, or minor bugs for that matter.Definitely try this game if you like platformers in the stealth genre. It should give you a few good hours of gameplay for the main gampaign acts, more if you try to get 100% completion on each level.			",171,91,5,6,15,0,12

												I would highly recommend Monaco, especially if you love stealth or heist based games. This game can be played with 1-4 players and even has its own level editor that allows you to design your own banks, houses, or whatever to steal from with friends and others!Get it or you shall miss out!

												Get it. I don't want to hear any excuses. Go buy it now. This is THE co-op action game of the year for me. It's simple to learn, complex to master. Each of the characters brings unique abilities to the table, and all the variables in it make every replay of a map feel different. Plus they're adding a level editor as free DLC. Bombing, tunnelling, hacking, lockpicking, safecracking, chloroforming, disguising, stealing, flirting, dog-dodging fun!			",208,60,1,33,17,2,39

												This game's attention was worth it.In 2010 this game was shown at IGF, and it won a slew of awards, now, three long years later, it has arrived.the enviroments, animations, and enimies are stylish, and the top down look works well, the story is cool, and the multiplayer is great fun (even with strangers).BUT... there are some flaws, the level design is very so-so, and the playable characters' models need some work.the music is great, it sets the tone very well, you would never know that it was composed by the same guy who did Journey's music.all-in-all a solid 8.75			",213,26,5,18,15,1,24

												A lot of thought and design went into this game and it shows, from the concept to the level design this stealth / heist game is a lot fun. Most of the various characters feel unique each with there own advatages and disadvantages. Co-op is great especially with 3 or 4 players each playing a different class lending their special talents like a disguises or tranq darts. If you like playing rouge / theif type characters you'll really enjoy Monaco.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is a game that’s as much about thinking on your feet as it is about stealth and forward planning, and regardless of whether you’re after a fun co-op game for four people, or something to speedrun to impress people on YouTube, I daresay there’s something here for everyone thanks to its focus on sheer entertainment. It’s exquisitely pieced together in almost every way, it lets you play in a variety of different ways and challenges you to think outside the box, and I can’t imagine anyone that could fail to be taken in by its charms.Monaco is a fantastic and unique take on the stealth genre and a showcase of excellent design, and you should make it yours. Not getting your hands on this would be a crime.			",516,135,9,74,50,6,69

												At first I didn't really 'get' this game or why it was so good. I didn't care about the co-op either, as I figured playing with random people wouldn't be great. Then I found myself playing it all weekend and absolutely loving it, and hugely enjoying co-op with random people as well.It seems really simple at first, but the game has a lot of depth. You start to realise how many options you have for dealing with the levels, and the levels go from the trivial opening ones to incredibly difficult end ones. The middle levels are wonderful and the later levels are a huge challenge. A good co-op team can help but isn't required.The people playing the game are properly into it and everyone seems to intuitively understand what each other is doing, and it's a lot of fun.Highly recommended!

												After viewing the trailer for this game I wasn't exactly sure what I thought, it looked like it would be fun or it could be a horrible clunky mess of a game. After taking a gamble on this game I was not disappointed. I have not played many top down stealth games which have run this smoothly or been this much fun. The story, as minimalist as it is, is surprisingly engaging as well. If you're a fan of local coop and like playing games in the same room as your friends this game should probably be on your shortlist of must haves.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is a top-down heist game where you choose one of four characters (with an additional four unlocked as the story progresses), break out of prison, and then with the help of the mysterious Gentleman, attempt to flee Monaco. The story is in two parts, first told from the perspective of the Locksmith over 17 levels, then retold by the Pickpocket in another 16. There's also a level builder, and you can download new levels to play in the Steam community workshop.I'd call this a Stealth game, but the stealth often decays into a mad dash to run out of sight of enemies or to make a mad dash away from the C4 you just placed to blow open a safe or wall or security guard. The background music is reminiscent of ragtime piano, and changes to suit the situation if you're spotted or set off alarms.It's good in single-player, but where Monaco truly shines is 4-player co-op.I've very much enjoyed this game, and it's on sale (50% off) at the moment. Go buy this game, because it's great. :3			",442,146,7,68,44,2,65

												What can I say. This game is a fun co-op puzzle game. It reminds me of Bonanzo Brothers, an old game from back in the day. Basically everyone is working together to steal something, and then make a get away. Each class brings something unique to the table. The story is great. What this game excels at though is the casual fun that is to be had with friends.			",49,2,2,2,1,1,2

												Excerpt from the handbook of The Security Professionals Association of Monaco:""Dear future security officer, congratulations on choosing one of today's most exciting career opportunities in the Principality of Monaco. You are about to embark on an adventure unlike any other: guarding the wealth of some of the most powerful and famous people on the planet. Here are some useful guidelines to performing your job at the level of excellence and thoroughness that our customers have come to expect of us:- If you should face the possibility of dealing with an intruder, take a few seconds to make extra sure that it wasn't nothing. It was probably nothing.- If you are absolutely certain that you have spotted an intruder, but then lose track, don't feel too bad, somebody else has probably taken care of it.- If you should suddenly remember being in a firefight and losing sight of intruders mere moments ago - calm down. Go back to your post, and if you should see something again: remember rule #1.- Now for the most important rule: potted plants are sacred and must never be disturbed or looked at.- Do you think you saw somebody walk behind a potted plant? Maybe even four people? Do you think that you could find out for sure if you just, you know, looked at the plant? WELL TOUGH LUCK, DUMBASS, YOU HAD BETTER MADE ABSOLUTELY SURE FIRST SO GO BACK AND DO YOUR DUTY.- Somebody tried to hide behind a potted plant while you were in a firefight and you're absolutely 100% completely sure he is still there? FINE. SHOOT AT THE PLANT. See how you feel about it when we cut your paycheck, vacation and transfer you to guarding the basement toilets for the next 30 years, PLANTKILLER.- Also sacred? VENTS. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT MESS WITH THE VENTS. If an intruder is going inside a vent, DO NOT PURSUE. DO NOT SHOOT AT THE VENT. Do you know how to fix a vent? Cause I sure don't. SO DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING CAUSE ALL OF US TO SUFFOCATE BECAUSE YOU HAD TO PLAY THE HERO.- Finally, if you happen to shoot an intruder, do. not. touch. the. body. You probably didn't attend any biology classes so allow me to break it down for you: dead bodies carry HORRIBLE TERRIBLE DISEASES. Leave them exactly where they drop and return to your station immediately. Somebody better equipped to handle the situation than your plant-killing vent-shooting♥♥♥♥♥is surely going to come and take care of it. We have found that bodies have a tendency to disappear more quickly when left unattended.With these simple guidelines you should have a blast in your new job! In light of recent unexpected mortality spikes we hope that you understand that we had to revoke all life insurance policies for new employees.""[[On a more serious note, if you have a bunch of friends to play then Monaco is a funny, challenging and surprisingly complex co-op heist game, featuring a nice soundtrack and multiple free expansions.]]			",199,113,0,28,13,0,18

												Very fun and challenging game, with a nicely balanced difficulty curve. I'm my opinion, it's best in Co-op and it's available both local and online. The latter is a nice way to meet other players and build strong (ish) teams to clear out those rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s's floors. Of course that implies sneaking, breaking vaults with laser tourettes poiting straight at you and being synchronized with the people you rely on saving your butt by cutting off the power, hacking through computers, breaking through walls, disguising  and even ""cleaning"" or seducing the guards and civilians. You may need to be revived too, so for the sake of your team mates, please don't die in a laser room or in front of a guard. The bushes are your friends and those smoke bombs are going to save your♥♥♥♥♥many times. The top-down view presenting the architectural plans of the floor are very accurate and easily navigable by the players. I give this game a 9/10, it's definitely worth it's money for many fun hours at a time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Voice acting does a great job of conveying the right atmosphere and it just makes me want to discuss tactics with a bad french accent. The developer is making a great job of updating this game for free and it also has Steam Workshop support for even more extra content. It's my personal indie game of 2013.			",463,237,16,78,53,5,84

												The game is really chaotic, but by the time it's understandable, how to play it.Sometimes, I was getting lags (maybe also generally because of host) and at some action (it could be because of something of my computer, not by the game).Often it was hard to connect on some server and sometimes I was disconnected from the server, because the game was ended by the host during the playing/game...I wouldn't pay for that game.Somebody likes these types of games, but someone doesn't enjoy these types of games.I just tried this game. Also, it's not such a bad game.You can choose there of some other specific characters (with/for whom You'll play current game)  and modes.There are a lot of sorts of maps and functions.There is also single-player mode and also multiplayer mode, so You can play alone or also with other players and your friends......etc.·˙_____________________________________________˙·.*Edit [7. april 2014 - 3:15 PM]     Over time I have changed my opinion at this game. Who loves these types of the games, then it's great game with lots of functions.Also, You can try 'tutorial' in the game, through which are explained specific functions of characters.*Edit [24. november 2016 - 4:05 PM]Corrected a few grammar mistakes.

												I have now dumped more hours in Monaco than any other game, except for my top 2 favorite games. You know what that means? It's my 3rd favorite. I liked it that much. I beat the game multiplayer with my friends and it was a blast. I beat it by myself and still had hectic fun. Through and through the clever gameplay, awesome action, and even the story were fantastic. Completely worthy of all the praise it gets.			",145,25,1,9,7,0,8

												Lead a gang of misanthropic professional thieves through a string of heists in Monaco: What’s yours is mine, an exciting stealth-based action game with retro graphics. Each professional in your gang has their own specialty and it’s up to you to use the right man (or woman) for the job.While Monaco is definitely playable solo (for some of the missions) its real strength lies in multiplayer where you are able to combine up to 4 various professionals’ talents to subdue guards, thwart security systems, and steal everything in sight. The game is also more forgiving in multiplayer, allowing you to resuscitate your comrades if they fall in the line of duty. If you’re feeling unchallenged, there’s also a level editor that allows for a wide variety of custom-made mission that you can make and share with others.As of February 2017, this game’s online community has died off quite a bit, so if you’re planning on picking up this title I would recommend getting 2-3 friends to tag along. Monaco is loads of fun with the right group. ",217,103,1,22,12,4,23

												This game has you and hopefully some other people working together to enact heists. The game focuses on stealth over going in guns blazing, though it does have a variety of tools and weapons that can be used offensively or defensively. The cast is straight out of a heist movie, featuring a lookout, a locksmith, a gentleman that can disguise, a hacker, and so on. If you like stealth games with a less serious side, this is for you!Pros: rewards careful playersrequires planningall characters are enjoyable and mostly viable in any situationmissions are varied and challenginggraphics are simple and self explanatorycons: not many people play anymoresome levels are brutally difficult and frustratingThe survival mode is clearly unrefined and is pretty much dead on arrival			",42,5,0,1,4,1,1

												I've played a ton of this on Xbox, and picked it up on Steam summer sale.  Well worth it.  Monaco is linear.  It is repetitive but it is also damn fun and outstandingly exciting when you pull a win out of your a$$.  This IS a co-op game.  Single player is less mayhem and challenge.  Half the fun is your friends tripping alarms or gunmen and you having to figure out wtf do we do now?  Haven't made it to community maps or level editor yet, but that plus more content is what brought me from Xbox to Steam.  Bottom Line:  get some friends, get some copies and enjoy this great co-op indie title			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a pleasure to play. Four player co-op itself is a strong selling point for a game; adding a terrific art style and a dynamic soundtrack makes this game all the more appealing. What makes this game a must-have, though? The fight-or-flight gameplay style. You can sneak your way through, looting every coin and dodging every guard, or you can dive in all Tally-HO! into the action, sprinting down corridors and peppering security with bullets in a frantic escape. The choice is yours.Thumbs up!			",123,16,2,11,18,3,8

												Hands down, the best game I have ever experienced. Though it was made in 2009 it has graphical capabilities akin to next-gen consoles. The narrative storytelling seems real, beautiful, as Microsoft Sam always does. I feel as though I need to help the Rats or my purpose in life will never be fulfilled the Rats need me, and I need the Rats. I will never put this game down, the sheer heavenly, awe-inspiring, near-♥♥♥♥♥♥ic experience this game gives you is like nothing else I have ever seen. Beware: this game will, 100%, eat away hours, days, months and eventually years of your life as the lifelike physics bamboozle you thank you Invent4 Entertainment you are all Gods and will live in my unworthy, mortal heart forever. Simply the greatest game developers that have made the best games the have ever existed. I salute you. Well, now my heart-filled intro is over, I really need to stress how good this game is. The developers tease you greatly with the USP (Unique Selling Points) on the store page and they are: Revel in your success as the cat meets a violent demise in any number of humorous ways at the hands of Bad Rats... Comic cartoon violence and cartoon blood Realistic physics simulation 10 Specialist Rats, anxious for revenge 11 different and bloody deaths for cats 10 other functional objects to help you 44 Maps, from easy to very hard Internet and local records Original, cartoon styled characters Challenge your creativity, intelligence and logic Unlock all the Steam Achievements But that's not all, there is a spiritual side to this game that I don't think even the developers know they implemented a oneness with the Gods. While you can have fun earning every achievement each one unlocking a sense of pleasure more than you can ever experience with any other game no any other moment in you're entire life. Each puzzle is an embodiment of pure culture and art. Art made by Rube Goldberg-Esq physics and complex solutions. This game, oh, this game, I really cannot say enough about it I love this game. I can't say it enough I love this game, and so will you. You will succumb to the awesomeness of this game the, the thorough and overall righteousness of this experience. If you don't own Bad Rats, you have not lived a full and proper life in anyone's eyes. I would rate this 11/10 if I could. While writing this, I am currently crying all over my keyboard due to the beauty of this game, my keyboard is now soaked and some keys don't seem to be working. I sob because not everybody owns this game and that means they have never, ever, been truly happy. I love you, Invent4 entertainment, for developing this game, and I also love and cherish you, Strategy First for, on the great day of the 20th of July 2009, publishing this game and blessing this small, humble world with the holy, out-of-this world, pure greatness that is the one and only: Bad Rats. Now, to Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. People think that this is the exact same as the original, but it isn't. It has all the things that the Godly original had, the Nobel-prize worthy 4:3 screen mode so beautiful that there was no need for 16:9 and not to mention the fact you can play in a 1240 PX resolution. The technological world, no, the entire world, all the worlds the universe did not foresee the striking difference 1240 PX game play has against the standard 1280. But, Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge is something perfect, people said Braid was ""The Perfect Game"" but then they played Bad Rats said it was Godly and then realized the power of Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge it has something that neither science nor religion can explain. Something only a unknown, un-comprehendable higher power can give a reason for, a true explanation. The Rats' Revenge seems to be able to unite everybody and has been documented to have been able to end wars, and be the first real, legitimate sign of world peace being achievable. In the great war of 2009. the US government, CIA, and FBI created a game capable of sending waves of peace across the world. Everyone who played it was happier than they had ever been, and realized the was no reason for fighting when you had Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. No other game or other form of media had been able to achieve this, to give this amazing degree of hope to a mortal world plagued by war. The game was a message from God, a holy beckoning that has ultimately saved the world from utter destruction. The game has saved all of us, and that is why we need to pay our respects to it. I say that this day, the 1st of November, after the day of the devil Halloween should be Bad Rats day, to show that we are past the evil spirits that once doomed us because of this one, singular, 300MB piece of pure glory. On this day, the world will pray for the Rats and show non-believers what this game really is, by sending copies to everyone we know. This is why it is on sale, it is holy. 10/10			",64,5,1,2,5,0,2

												The quintessential co-op experience. Every moment of this game spent playing with friends is an absolute joy whether you succeed or fail. The visual style may take some getting used to but it serves its purpose, but what puts this game over the top is the music. The soundtrack is a brilliant compilation of piano tracks reminiscent to those of the silent movie era, and the tone and pace of the song changes depending on the situation, making it feel like your playing a wonderfully interactive heist film. If you're gonna play this game, play it with friends or you're doing yourself a great disservice. 9/10			",95,26,0,7,4,1,7

												I wasn't sure what to expect from Monaco, whether it would be more arcade or more realistic. And I've come to the conclusion it's a little bit of both.When you open the game, the menu itself moves very nicely, with graphics flowing in the background. Right off the bat, there are multiple gamemode options. I dove right into “Campaign” mode, and, like many other games, it showed me the first mission I could complete in color, and all the others were grayed out. However, what I really liked about playing Monaco's campaign, is that I could join/start a lobby, have up to three other people with me, and could stay in that lobby and keep selecting episodes instead of having to join a new lobby for each episode. The gameplay itself is very nice. You start on the first episode by choosing one of four characters, each with their own perk. As you progress through levels, you gain more characters. The game loads very quickly, after you depart from the neat lobby menu of changing options (which is always fun). It is a top-down game, but there are obviously good reasons for that. On the top, directions will be given as to what you have to do, so that it's never confusing, and the goal is to sneak past the police/guards to get to the object the heist was started for and all the spare money along the way. There are weapons to pick up from time to time, but I found that running away from guards and hiding in a room for a few seconds keeps them off your scent.Pros:Menus move very smoothly.The graphics, being a top-down game, are pretty decent.The objectives are always clear.You can stay in the same lobby for as many levels as you choose.All campaign levels can be completed in either singleplayer or multiplayer.The controller support is amazing, and I actually prefer to use the controller.There's Steam Workshop to download new levels to play.It's local co-op too, so it's good for a party with friends if you have more than one controller.Cons:Gun reloading is very obnoxious. It shouldn't take 10 seconds for one bullet to reload.The co-op community is not as large as I had hoped.Guards are almost too easy to get past.So, basically, I had a lot of fun playing this game, though I would recommend getting it on sale.

What´s this game about?This game is a incredible top-down stealth game with big, open levels, interesting characters with various abilities and weaknesses, each proposing a different playstyle. You break into art galleries, embassys, police headquarters, ships, prisons (...), each level featuring an interesting combination of surveillance cameras, lasers, handprint scanners, locked doors, ventilation shafts, bushes or plants to hide in, PCs and power outlets to inject viruses, and inattentive guards carrying special keys. (...) How much content/replayability?There is a vast amount of dev-made levels, including little text-based briefings. You can replay a level again and again, a different character selection most certainly leading to a entirely different game expierence. It is great fun to collect all coins scattered through the levels (""clean out""), which acts +/- as a optional sidequest.Additional:And then there is the Steam workshop....And then there is Multiplayer, which is almost a game on its own, including 4-player support.And then there are gadgets, like shotguns, crossbows with tranquillizer darts, medikits, smoke bombs, C4 (...) which you obtain by collecting coins.SO: Buy this game if you like stealth, Co-Op action/voicechat chaos, good timing, tactical thinking and top-down games.I give it a 9/10. Excellent indie game with balanced and distinct characters, very good replayability, 4-Player Co-Op Support and the Steam Workshop offering even more old rich men to loot. ",96,3,2,2,4,0,15

Its a must play if your a fan of games like Payday. The art style is incredibly simple yet unique and it really characterises the game into something I have never played before.Definitly a 10/10 as long as you play with friends, playing singleplayer is okay but no way near as fun personally.

												Monaco is a very fun game: you can play in singleplayer mode as well with up to 3 friends using one among 8 characters with different special skills (yes, it's much more fun playing with friends). Every level is pretty much unique and you can approach at it in many different ways, according to the members of your party. Obviously the stealthier the better. At the end of every level your score is based upon the time you spent finishing the level (that is catching the main objectives) to which will be added a penalty that will be as big as he coins you missed during the level.Artistically speaking, we're dealing with a jewel: your screen will be invaded by any sort of color and the retro style is something simply beatiful.Base gameplay is already various, but it's additionally enhanced by the presence of the zombie mode which is very difficult, even though I haven't played very much.In addition to what I've already written, there are many interesting community levels which can help you learn the basics of the classes and many tricks.In the end: I absolutely recommend this game because it's simply one of the best and deep coop experiences you can find.10/10			",107,23,0,18,14,0,15

												It's definitely something that you can play, be challenged by, but also feel like you're clever enough to beat it. Thankfully online multiplayer is friendly and cooperative, though maybe that's because you can't complete the levels unless everyone is alive. Definitely fun when playing with friends, but also rewarding when playing alone, either in the normal mode or zombie mode. Worth the money at any price.			",7,1,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is annoying and weird at first, however! after about 1 hour into gameplay and playing some with my friend, who also bought this game. It began to become fun. I give this a 30/10 :) for anyone who likes PvP and Heisting in France. The only catch is the new interface and the confusing intro. I also recommend playing this with a friend for best results :)			",107,6,0,10,14,1,17

												The quintessential co-op experience. Every moment of this game spent playing with friends is an absolute joy whether you succeed or fail. The visual style may take some getting used to but it serves its purpose, but what puts this game over the top is the music. The soundtrack is a brilliant compilation of piano tracks reminiscent to those of the silent movie era, and the tone and pace of the song changes depending on the situation, making it feel like your playing a wonderfully interactive heist film. If you're gonna play this game, play it with friends or you're doing yourself a great disservice. 9/10			",95,26,0,7,4,1,7

When playing alone however, the gameplay feels lacking as youre limited to the special ability of only one character. However, the more people you add to the game, the more fun it gets!

												Hands down, the best game I have ever experienced. Though it was made in 2009 it has graphical capabilities akin to next-gen consoles. The narrative storytelling seems real, beautiful, as Microsoft Sam always does. I feel as though I need to help the Rats or my purpose in life will never be fulfilled the Rats need me, and I need the Rats. I will never put this game down, the sheer heavenly, awe-inspiring, near-♥♥♥♥♥♥ic experience this game gives you is like nothing else I have ever seen. Beware: this game will, 100%, eat away hours, days, months and eventually years of your life as the lifelike physics bamboozle you thank you Invent4 Entertainment you are all Gods and will live in my unworthy, mortal heart forever. Simply the greatest game developers that have made the best games the have ever existed. I salute you. Well, now my heart-filled intro is over, I really need to stress how good this game is. The developers tease you greatly with the USP (Unique Selling Points) on the store page and they are: Revel in your success as the cat meets a violent demise in any number of humorous ways at the hands of Bad Rats... Comic cartoon violence and cartoon blood Realistic physics simulation 10 Specialist Rats, anxious for revenge 11 different and bloody deaths for cats 10 other functional objects to help you 44 Maps, from easy to very hard Internet and local records Original, cartoon styled characters Challenge your creativity, intelligence and logic Unlock all the Steam Achievements But that's not all, there is a spiritual side to this game that I don't think even the developers know they implemented a oneness with the Gods. While you can have fun earning every achievement each one unlocking a sense of pleasure more than you can ever experience with any other game no any other moment in you're entire life. Each puzzle is an embodiment of pure culture and art. Art made by Rube Goldberg-Esq physics and complex solutions. This game, oh, this game, I really cannot say enough about it I love this game. I can't say it enough I love this game, and so will you. You will succumb to the awesomeness of this game the, the thorough and overall righteousness of this experience. If you don't own Bad Rats, you have not lived a full and proper life in anyone's eyes. I would rate this 11/10 if I could. While writing this, I am currently crying all over my keyboard due to the beauty of this game, my keyboard is now soaked and some keys don't seem to be working. I sob because not everybody owns this game and that means they have never, ever, been truly happy. I love you, Invent4 entertainment, for developing this game, and I also love and cherish you, Strategy First for, on the great day of the 20th of July 2009, publishing this game and blessing this small, humble world with the holy, out-of-this world, pure greatness that is the one and only: Bad Rats. Now, to Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. People think that this is the exact same as the original, but it isn't. It has all the things that the Godly original had, the Nobel-prize worthy 4:3 screen mode so beautiful that there was no need for 16:9 and not to mention the fact you can play in a 1240 PX resolution. The technological world, no, the entire world, all the worlds the universe did not foresee the striking difference 1240 PX game play has against the standard 1280. But, Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge is something perfect, people said Braid was ""The Perfect Game"" but then they played Bad Rats said it was Godly and then realized the power of Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge it has something that neither science nor religion can explain. Something only a unknown, un-comprehendable higher power can give a reason for, a true explanation. The Rats' Revenge seems to be able to unite everybody and has been documented to have been able to end wars, and be the first real, legitimate sign of world peace being achievable. In the great war of 2009. the US government, CIA, and FBI created a game capable of sending waves of peace across the world. Everyone who played it was happier than they had ever been, and realized the was no reason for fighting when you had Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. No other game or other form of media had been able to achieve this, to give this amazing degree of hope to a mortal world plagued by war. The game was a message from God, a holy beckoning that has ultimately saved the world from utter destruction. The game has saved all of us, and that is why we need to pay our respects to it. I say that this day, the 1st of November, after the day of the devil Halloween should be Bad Rats day, to show that we are past the evil spirits that once doomed us because of this one, singular, 300MB piece of pure glory. On this day, the world will pray for the Rats and show non-believers what this game really is, by sending copies to everyone we know. This is why it is on sale, it is holy. 10/10			",64,5,1,2,5,0,2

												Great game with amazing art and concept.This game will surely bring all your friends together as you will work toegther as one cohesive unit. This game relies on the skills of each and every character. You can beat this game on your own, but it will be hard. Playing single player often gets me thinking ""Having a breacher here would be great."" or ""Man, a lookout stationed here would be really helpful"" which is why playing online is the only way to go.The music, is another plus point in this game. The music has a lot of pace, picking up extremely fast as you get spotted by a guard, or managed to take the prized loot. During sneaking mode, the music provides a spy-ish sort of music.Overall this game is guaranteed to give you a whole lot of fun and a unique experience, be it bad or good totally depends on your teamwork, when working in a team.My rating: 8.5/10			",41,7,1,3,8,0,6

												Monaco is the first game I’ve played that truly nails the feeling of the heist, with enough traps, items, and different characters that co-op play with friends should be a staple of your online activity for the months to come. However, the over-long campaign is a chore when played solo, especially when the story suffers as a result. If you and your friends are looking for a new game to play together, Monaco is a no-brainer. But playing through Monaco by yourself, or leaving your enjoyment up to groups of strangers, can yield uneven results.			",109,13,0,9,9,0,4

												This game is a pleasure to play. Four player co-op itself is a strong selling point for a game; adding a terrific art style and a dynamic soundtrack makes this game all the more appealing. What makes this game a must-have, though? The fight-or-flight gameplay style. You can sneak your way through, looting every coin and dodging every guard, or you can dive in all Tally-HO! into the action, sprinting down corridors and peppering security with bullets in a frantic escape. The choice is yours.Thumbs up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An indie coop heist game.Amazingly fun to play in coop with friends online or on a single screen, though it requires X360 gamepads for other players (max 4 players either on- or offline). Great challenge when going solo, especially with the additional task of collecting all the loot. The game may look simple at first, but give it some time and you should find it interestingly challenging. Definitely for people who like to max out the levels. There are eight characters to choose from (4 during the first missions); each has its advantages and drawbacks, thus each of them requires a different approach and strategies, but in coop they complement each other. Time spent on each level can be compared with other players via the built-in leaderboards. Not to mention the great, full of twists story, the built-in map editor (steam workshop), good humour (guards' voices), good replay value, additional zombie mode and the free expansion which closes the story. There are a couple of flaws, but they are outnumbered by the sheer fun when playing this. It seems like the developers really loved creating this gem. At least that's what I felt while playing it.

												If you have some several stealth-game addicted friends I highly recommended you to buy and play this together.Singleplayer is fine, but you'll always feel like you need some friends.this game is supposed to play coop by design, and it will be the best coop stealth game you've ever played.It's one of those stealth game that you can't just go full lethal and win; it pretty much force you to stealth, and in a fun way by great level design. Also, character design, art style, storyline and story telling, and especially OST are pure gold.Perfect in term of art and game.			",309,66,7,57,16,2,29

												What if 'Hotline Miami' went MP and PG13? You would get something like Monaco. Instead of collecting bodies and smashing skulls, here you get to collect coins and break walls. 7 characters with different abilities and 2 versions of the well-written campaign make a highly addictive game. Despite it's utterly minimalistic graphics some missions can get tricky and if that wasn't enough you can create your own with an easy to use built in-level editor. A must steal!

												Monaco is the first game I’ve played that truly nails the feeling of the heist, with enough traps, items, and different characters that co-op play with friends should be a staple of your online activity for the months to come. However, the over-long campaign is a chore when played solo, especially when the story suffers as a result. If you and your friends are looking for a new game to play together, Monaco is a no-brainer. But playing through Monaco by yourself, or leaving your enjoyment up to groups of strangers, can yield uneven results.			",109,13,0,9,9,0,4

												This game is a pleasure to play. Four player co-op itself is a strong selling point for a game; adding a terrific art style and a dynamic soundtrack makes this game all the more appealing. What makes this game a must-have, though? The fight-or-flight gameplay style. You can sneak your way through, looting every coin and dodging every guard, or you can dive in all Tally-HO! into the action, sprinting down corridors and peppering security with bullets in a frantic escape. The choice is yours.Thumbs up!			",123,16,2,11,18,3,8

Monaco is all about the grand heists. Robbing casinos, banks, palaces, hotels and escaping with everything that's shiny. A series of levels in which you steal all the goodies then make a quick run for the nearest exit. Monaco is truly a unique take on the ""heist"" genre. If you give it half a chance and more than just a couple of challenging hours then you just might find a hidden gem that is more enjoyable and challenging than many other AAA games that are out there right now.Monaco may initially be written off as just a bare-bones 2D top-down view game, boring when played alone. But I did. And it was great. To me this title is very underrated. If you go deeper into the gameplay and the storyline that stretches across multiple levels, you'll find a game that's both intriguing and amusing. Monaco follows a crew of misfits, with each individual bringing a set of shady abilities to the table. They're all in it for the long con. The player gets to control any one of them on each level, and as they are each and all very different, so is the manner, tempo, and style by which you can play. Monaco has all the characteristics of a good PC heist game:Planning and strategy is crucial every step of the way; if you just jump into a room full of guards you are sure to die in the ensuing chaos. There are many tools of the trade provided however, and it's important to use them carefully. Monaco grows on you the more you come to terms with how simple yet challenging the game mechanics work.Level design is logical, meaningful, and often intimidating. But the game does a good job of balancing skill, strategy and luck for the player. There are often several methods of reaching the objective within a given level. This goes hand in hand with the various different characters within the game, and I do mean everyone. Monaco takes every one of them into account and still (perhaps) manages to balance the challenge for each different style of play. I myself preferred to play as the Gentleman. PC (KB+M) controls are simple, sharp and manageable. Keyboard remapping is also available, but for some reason does not work in the menus. The character you control is always in your focal point as this is a top-down view game; there should be no blaming the camera for any mistakes you make here. The in-game HUD is also minimal and clear on objectives and whatever else needs to be known.  AI is a little difficult to explain here, but like most games the more you play Monaco the easier it is to understand and adapt. The key is in avoiding detection; the longer you are out in plain view of guards and civilians the more suspicion you draw. This suspicion is based on line of sight; but unlike how it is often very difficult to know where guards are and how they will see you in FPS or third-person games, the top-down strategic view here makes things much easier for you to act and react. This level of control really makes you understand that if something does go wrong, then only you are to blame.  ",54,12,1,8,2,0,4

												Monaco is a hidden gem. At first glance, when watching youtube videos of it, it looks complicated and probably boring, but I couldn't be more wrong. Monaco is one of my favorite game. It is a top down view, and there are different class, and you basically try to steal treasures while avoiding guards, camera, civilians, lasers, etc.; sounds boring? but trust me, it is really fun. It's a shame that there are almost no one playing online. Don't let that discourage you though, single player is really fun, but better with multiplayer. Like I said, this game is a hidden gem.

												Monaco Whats Yours Is Mine     We've all had that fantasy, you know, the one where you plan an elaborate heist, Even if you haven't i'm sure you have at least seen ocean's 11. Sadly if you tried this in real life you would risk going to prison, but fret no more because finally a game has come out where you can do just that (other than payday), without suffering the real life consequences of robbing a bank.     Sound 4/5     Art 5/5     Gameplay 4/5     Story 3/5     Overall 16/20     On the sound spectrum i think I was rather generous as the music is not tremendous (purely my opinion), but there are no horrible sound effects that take away from the experience of the game. Where it really excels in this spectrum is the voice acting. while not much dialogue, the little there is is very funny.      At the quality AAA games are at in this day of age it is hard for small teams to get that same feel, so many go for the retro look. However, just because the graphics aren't of their era doesn't write them off the art category. Even though it may not look real it is still one of most beautifully presented games i have ever seen. they really pushed what they could do with the graphics they had     The gameplay is light, fun and a blast with friends. the high speed robbery is a great mechanic and can only be built on,and with so many different classes to choose from it can take a lot of planning until you and your friends have the perfect bank mugging dream team. you can also go solo if you wish and will still be challenged to a very fun and strategic game. Sometimes you can spend hours trying to get that top spot on the leaderboards and it is a game that suites that competitiveness completely. sadly, this game can get slightly repetitave after playing for a while and the replay value isnt great at this point     The story in this game is good but not great, it is quite simple and engaging but gets quite predictable and you sometimes just skip some dialogues before the level completely. However, the story gets the job done and really is not what this game is focused on. like many retro style games story is an afterthought and that definately shows in Monaco, but it is not bad to a point that it ruins the game     I would recommend this game to anyone who has any taste in games. with all the cookie-cutter fps games there are it is pleasant to see something  innovative and new. It is well worth the money and I think most people would have a good time with it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco takes the style of the classic pacman gameplay where you collect loot in a top down view and makes it 10 times more fun, involved, and frantic, wither you're playing alone, or with friends.The goal of each level is to go through a series of ""floors"" of a location and collect all the trophies, then escape. However, this is quite easily done, and most if not all players will eventually decide to start clearing floors, which involves you collecting all the coins on each floor, as well as the trophies, before moving onto the next. Clearing a whole level is a fun challenge that rewards you with a harder version of that level.The game plays quite differently on Singleplayer than it does on Multiplayer most of the time. If you're someone who loves stealth and likes to take it slowly and perfectly, then singleplayer is for you, where some obsticles will require a small plan if you want to get past it unnoticed. Multiplayer is more fast paced, with almost always something going wrong.  You'll quickly find 4 players running around the level hiding in bushes and reviving each other while being chased by dogs, helicopters, guards and more - it's a great laugh.The game has a whole bunch of content to keep you going for hours - just look at my playtime - 100 hours (almost!). There's 3 campaigns, each of which can be played on a normal mode, and a zombie mode where even civillians try to kill you, then there's custom levels, which are made by you and other players alike. Custom levels means there's a level editor which will also keep you busy if that's your thing - its loads of fun to design a place to rob, believe me!All in all, Monaco is a great game to pick up and play for an hour or two whenever you want. When you start out give it a few hours so you can get used to the art style, which can confuse a lot of people at first, and make sure you play more than the first few levels - they're mainly just tutorial levels!

												Monaco takes the style of the classic pacman gameplay where you collect loot in a top down view and makes it 10 times more fun, involved, and frantic, wither you're playing alone, or with friends.The goal of each level is to go through a series of ""floors"" of a location and collect all the trophies, then escape. However, this is quite easily done, and most if not all players will eventually decide to start clearing floors, which involves you collecting all the coins on each floor, as well as the trophies, before moving onto the next. Clearing a whole level is a fun challenge that rewards you with a harder version of that level.The game plays quite differently on Singleplayer than it does on Multiplayer most of the time. If you're someone who loves stealth and likes to take it slowly and perfectly, then singleplayer is for you, where some obsticles will require a small plan if you want to get past it unnoticed. Multiplayer is more fast paced, with almost always something going wrong.  You'll quickly find 4 players running around the level hiding in bushes and reviving each other while being chased by dogs, helicopters, guards and more - it's a great laugh.The game has a whole bunch of content to keep you going for hours - just look at my playtime - 100 hours (almost!). There's 3 campaigns, each of which can be played on a normal mode, and a zombie mode where even civillians try to kill you, then there's custom levels, which are made by you and other players alike. Custom levels means there's a level editor which will also keep you busy if that's your thing - its loads of fun to design a place to rob, believe me!All in all, Monaco is a great game to pick up and play for an hour or two whenever you want. When you start out give it a few hours so you can get used to the art style, which can confuse a lot of people at first, and make sure you play more than the first few levels - they're mainly just tutorial levels!

												Monaco where to begin. You have to have steam friends who have this game to enjoy it if you dont its not as fun. Coop is fun with 3 other friends that can be crazy. But when it is crazy sometimes hard to tell what is happening at times. I was not fond of the art style but you would not mind when you and your friends are running from guards!			",119,6,0,11,3,1,2

												6 hours in and I can already tell that this game was a good use of my money.Right from the get-go, I liked it. I have a soft spot for good stealth games, and this game set off on the right foot by following my 3 basic rules for making a decent stealth game:1. The player must always be aware hgow close they are to being spotted by each guard2. There must be many ways to approach one goal in an open-ended level3. The controls must be tight and responsive enough for the player to have agency in the gameplayMonaco does all three things very well: each guard has a sight meter over them which fills up over time, the levels are open-ended and full of extra ways to navigate them, and the player is simple and fun to control.A good buy, even when not on sale. When it does go on sale, but four copies and have fun remaking the heist movie of your choice! ",43,4,0,11,5,0,23

												Solid multiplayer game. This game has both local co-op and online, though not both at the same time.   It's a fun game that can both be played as a strategic heist game, or a fun run through a guard infested building.   It works well as a multiplayer, or single player, and can be enjoyed equally in either mode. Personally I find it best in couch co-op though it can be frustrating.  Some of the mechanics are a little annoying. (sight doesn't work as you expect at times), and a few rooms feel like you need certain abilities to ""cleanly"" get away. But where else are you going to get a mole to dig a tunnel through a wall, to allow a hacker to hack a light switch to disable a security laser, then let the lock smith unlock a safe, while the lookout is watching for guards.

They keep attacking but then you finally escape their search.You plan a heist perfectly, but then it innevitably all goes into the gutter and you half the police force on your tail. The thrill of escape as you steal diamonds right under a guard's nose.

Posted: May 29, 2015
												My only complaint about the game is that the classes are boring. Currently the classes you can play as are: a “locksmith,” a “pickpocket,” a “cleaner,” a “lookout,” a “mole,” a “gentleman,” a “hacker,” a “redhead,” and a “blonde.” Really? No WONDER so few finished the game. The people we played with are just boring. Cliches. Veritable “mehs.”But it doesn’t have to stay this way. Pocketwatch Games can fix this by replacing these classes with cooler ones. Specifically these:We can replace the “locksmith” with “Sasha Grey.” The Sasha Grey class makes money by taking many hard tasks simultaneously (often four at a time!). She takes them harder and faster than the other classes and, though they would cause other classes such vertigo that others would vomit, she, at her limits, would just gag and roll her eyes back and ask for more, and with profanities! This class is like a “tank,” and can take great punishment.As for the “pickpocket,” how about “Jenna Haze”? Jenna Haze has an easy-going, perky personality. She’s the charmer of the group. She’s enthusiastic and energetic, bending over to do almost any task. She also has tan skin. This is useful.As for “the cleaner,” that can be replaced by “Tori Black.” Not particularly good at anything but above average at everything, you can count on her to do basically anything. And I mean anything. Some of the others may resent her non-specialization—but the absolute value of her skills makes her a force to be watched.The “lookout”? Let’s replace ‘im with “Lexi Belle.” Don’t let her quiet, high school girl demeanor make you think she’s not willing to do dirty deeds. She’s the innocent-looking one among this group, and you’re going to need her, because, well, everyone else in the group looks a little…suspicious? I think that’s the word. You’re going to need Lexi Belle to balance that look out.And the “mole.” How about “Jesse Jane”? Having grown up on military bases, this girl has the discipline and experience necessary to get almost any job done (wink wink). She’s a down-to-earth girl; not as sunshine and unicorns as Jenna, but not as hard as Sasha. And she has a mischievous facial expression none of the others have. You really want this girl on the team.What of the “gentleman”? Well, obviously: James Deen. With his boyish face, athletic physique, and blue eyes, he’s obviously a gentleman. Female guards will look at him and immediately become disarmed (of COURSE there are female guards in this game! Don’t be a sexist!). He has an incredible amount of experience for his age, and unlike many of the other male candidates for the job, well, he can play the “gentleman.” He’s also a good team player; he can work with the rest of the group all night long, and in many positions.Speaking of which, let’s replace the “hacker” with “Stoya.” Graduating high school at age 16, and being versed in computers and games (plus being a writer), how could we NOT want her on the team? She’s the nerd, and the most rebellious of the group; the proper answer to “the hacker.” Being of Scottish and Serbian ethnicity, she also brings something exotic to the team. How many Scottish, Serbian Americans have you played with?Now, the “redhead.” Coming out of retirement, we have “Faye Reagan.” Retiring from “the industry” early due to drug problems, Faye in this game gets a second chance at life. She realizes that she just has to focus on being good at what she believes in, which is sharing the wealth that her mind and body are capable of with this team of stars.And as for the “blonde,” “Kayden Kross.” No longer a performer but rather a director, she will be the leader of our group. This Swedish American writes well (though not as well as Stoya) and, with her French husband and partner in crime Manuel Ferrara, we can expect her to sweep Monaco’s rich men. Or perhaps rich women? (Mr. Ferrera demands that she work only with women for some reason if she DOES have to perform) (we’ll have to keep her away from the James Deen I guess). Kayden also happens to be the most beautiful of the group. Beautiful in that she has an aura of leadership.And there you have it! Just imagine all these characters in some Monaco mansion, working together all at once! Oh what fun that would be! Pocketwatch games! Give us what we desire!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine Review - Raymond KTSuffers from the same problem Dungeon Defenders did, in that it provides cooperative play without an incentive to utilize it (indeed in both cases it was almost a hindrance to bring others into the game). Had some fun with it though, probably worth checking out if you're not expecting much and you're just looking for a casual experience to share with a few people. I'd recommend waiting for a sale though. I wished there were more people playing this game. Multiplayer is pretty dead, need some AI bots to revive it.			",106,29,6,13,24,1,11

												Monaco is a unique take on the Heist genre and I applaud it. Story-There are a total of 49 story missions divided into 4 campaigns - Locksmith's Story(17 missions), Pickpocket's Story(16 missions), Origins(8 missions), Fin(8 missions). You can choose to do these missions in 3 different modes: Enhanced, Classic, Zombie. The Enhanced and Classic levels are practically the same except that some layout and AI changes have been made to the levels in Enhanced mode to make them easier.-The general story follows a group of thieves(The Locksmith, The Lookout, The Cleaner and The Pickpocket) as they finish various jobs for money or other things. As the story progresses, new members join the group, The Gentleman, The Hacker, The Mole, and the Redhead. The actual story is told by two members of the original cast - The Locksmith and the Pickpocket. They both share their versions of what they've done to an inspector. Those stories are very different in difficulty and actual narration.Locksmith's Story-Narrated mostly by the Locksmith. The ""Easy"" mode of this game if you ask me, and  the levels are similiar to the Pickpocket's story.Pickpocket's Story-Mostly narrated by the Pickpocket. The ""Hard"" versions of the missions from the Locksmith's story. Levels are fairly similiar but there are still some major differences. It includes one of the greatest twists that I have ever seen. SPOILER ALERT:The first crew(Locksmith,Lookout,Pickpocket,Cleaner) are the same people as the the second crew(Gentleman,Mole,Hacker,Redhead). The original crew was made up by the Gentleman to avoid arrest.Origins- Narrated by the Lookout talking to an Inspector.  Explains why the thieves started doing what they're doing. For them, the law doesn't apply until a ""moral debt"" is repaid to them. The Lookout, for example, does this because Haitian soldiers stole all her family's possessions.Fin-The Finale.Narrated by two inspectors chasing the thieves. The missions are mostly cleaning up evidence from previous jobs and escaping police officers that are looking for you.Gameplay-The gameplay mostly focuses on stealth - going in guns blazing is still possible but not recommended. Unlike other top down view games, this game doesn't allow you to see around corners unless your character leaves cover. The game instead gives you a blueprint of parts of the map you've already been to but you can't see where guards, civilians, and other useful items are.You are allowed to sneak and that will greatly reduce the distance from which guards and civilians spot you. Controls are very simple and most of the interactions require you to just walk into something and hold the same button until it's done. At the beginning of each level, you are presented with backpacks that hold various items. The backpacks can hold shotguns, SMGs, smoke grenades, C4, EMP, Wrenches that complete any action instantly, and even a rocket launcher and many more. This equipment is not mandatory to complete the mission, but highly recommended. Collecting 10 coins grants one more ""ammo"". A somewhat unrealistic mechanic is in the game - you can hide in bushes to hide from guards, though you if you are spotted while entering it or they will attack you. Some enemies are overpowered, like the Shotgun SWAT and the RPG Soldiers but they only appear on maps where they are generally easy to avoid. It's possible to beat this game in singleplayer, but co-op with a mic is highly recommended. Local co-op is also available, so that's a huge plus. Planning how to enter a building and how to disable an annoying laser to get the trophy with a friend feels amazing.The game, if you haven't noticed, also has a workshop. Sadly, we are not allowed to create weapons or character skins or props(you can, however, modify these in the game files) but in exchange we can create maps. Oh yes, your custom heist. It's really easy to learn how to use the ingame editor so you'll find yourself making a complex mission after 5 minutes of practice.Characters-The thieves in Monaco all have different special abilites, and that is, in my opinion, the greatest strength of the game. Though some are more powerful than others, each character has its usefulness.-Original Crew-The Locksmith: Can open locked doors, safes, ATMs and cash registers faster than any class-The Lookout: While sneaking, special icons represent enemies and civilians on the blueprint part of the map, allowing players to sense danger before it appears.-The Cleaner: Can knock guards and civilians unconscious and they remain in that state for a short period of time(~30 seconds).-The Pickpocket: His pet monkey follows him around and collects any coins that he misses.-New Members-The Gentleman: Can disguise himself while hidden allowing him to traverse areas that are normally off limits. Needs to stay away from guards and civilians or his cover will be blown almost instantly. (My favourite character.)-The Hacker: Can insert viruses into power outlets(crazy, right?) which allows him to disable security.-The Mole: Can dig through walls allowing you to get behind enemy lines.-The Redhead: Going near one guard,civilian(even female), or even a dog charms them and causes them to follow you around, allowing your team to get around easier.Special:-Blonde: The Redhead but when she was younger. Guards only attack when they get close. Only available in Redhead's origin mission and custom missions.Final VerdictStory: 9/10 - Considering that it's not the main focus of the game(and it shouldn't be), it's surprisingly good including the twist at the end.Gameplay: 10/10 - Read the Gameplay segment.Characters: 10/10 - The game doesn't give little information, but at the same time doesn't overload us. The perfect middle.Overall:10/10 ",101,15,9,11,4,1,8

												This game is a hell of a lot of fun.  Stealth games are something you dont see pulled off to well too often and this game really does a good job of creating tension while hiding and panic when you've been spotted.  When there are more than a few players in the game it becomes pure chaos, someone screws up and gets spotted and then theres a chain reaction where everyone gets dragged into it and are all scrambling to find a hiding spot.  The game has VOIP built in so if you play this with your friends you will all be screaming at each other while playing, its great.  There still seems to be a player base so you can play online with people but I reccomend getting a premade group together to go through it as some of the other players might already know what to do and take a lot of the challenge away.  This game has a bunch of different difficulty modes some of which i've not gone through yet because they were added after the last time I played but I will be trying to move through them now.  The game does get quite challenging so depending on your penchant for punishment you may only end up doing one of the story runs.  There are also community made maps and some quirky player vs player maps that add more content to the game. I find the art style and story to suit the gameplay quite well and really enjoy the charactes and how there are different campaigns that tell different sides of the story from different perspectives. All in all very quality experience for 15 dollars, highly reccomend.			",201,41,2,30,17,0,21

												This is a very unique and awesome stealth game. It has a strong emphasis on co-operative multiplayer gameplay, which more and more games are tapping into, and for the better.As a single-player title, it is not particularly impressive. It has its moments, but for a long while, the game is just too easy. Luckily, it has a lot of challenging and fun levels later on in which you'll actually have to play it stealthy.As a multiplayer game, it is one of the best gaming experiences one can have. I think having 2 players instead of 3 or 4 is still best, but all options are very fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a game to play with friends, and also any fans of the stealth genre (like me!).			",247,77,0,13,19,2,25

												Monaco has one of the most unique gameplay combinations I have played, its filled with indie pixely goodness, but also has a detailed ""stealth"" system along with 4 player co-op and a level editor makes for near endless fun. Monaco doesn't let its art style hold it back from telling a story either, throughout the campaign you will learn about the characters and what motivates them. The protagonists are each there own character with there own ""personality"", something I would think hard to do given the graphical style of the game. I think you should give Monaco a try. Its not an expensive game but it is definitely worth a few bucks!			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

Even if you get a friend to come over to your house and plug in an Xbox controller with you or to play online with you over the Internet it will make this game experience a much better for you.

												This game is a hell of a lot of fun.  Stealth games are something you dont see pulled off to well too often and this game really does a good job of creating tension while hiding and panic when you've been spotted.  When there are more than a few players in the game it becomes pure chaos, someone screws up and gets spotted and then theres a chain reaction where everyone gets dragged into it and are all scrambling to find a hiding spot.  The game has VOIP built in so if you play this with your friends you will all be screaming at each other while playing, its great.  There still seems to be a player base so you can play online with people but I reccomend getting a premade group together to go through it as some of the other players might already know what to do and take a lot of the challenge away.  This game has a bunch of different difficulty modes some of which i've not gone through yet because they were added after the last time I played but I will be trying to move through them now.  The game does get quite challenging so depending on your penchant for punishment you may only end up doing one of the story runs.  There are also community made maps and some quirky player vs player maps that add more content to the game. I find the art style and story to suit the gameplay quite well and really enjoy the charactes and how there are different campaigns that tell different sides of the story from different perspectives. All in all very quality experience for 15 dollars, highly reccomend.			",201,41,2,30,17,0,21

												Monaco is a deceptive game...looking at screenshots or trailers, you might get the impression that it is one of theses stealth games where you're supposed to go in, grab some loot, and get out like a shadow, without being seen or causing too much mayhem.But Monaco is not one of theses games. Monaco is as much about stealthing some parts, as it is about running around spreading chaos in others. Monaco doesn't care if you cause mayhem, it doesn't care if you kill people or not, it doesn't care if you've been seen or not. The one thing Monaco cares about is how long it took you to do all that.At the end of a level, Monaco only tells you how long it took you, then add a 10s penalty for every coin you missed, and finally, give you your leaderboards rank. Because Monaco is on a fundamental level all about speed. Cleaning levels as fast as you can is what Monaco is about. You can try to play stealthily, and never get seen, but it's not what the level design is made for, and it's probably not even achievable on the later levels, especially if you're trying to get all the loot.So is Monaco a good game in its genre ? Probably, for the few people who enjoy replaying the same level over and over again until they've figured out the perfect path and ends up being lucky in the random placements of loot. The devs had a vision, and they stuck to it, and they've executed well on that front. But most people aren't speedrunners. Most people play a game once (if at all) and are done with it. And for that great majority of players, i can't recommend it. The level design isn't really meant for doing anything else than going for perfect runs. Just getting the main objective and escaping will avoid most of the map and the difficulty, it will feel like skipping the level.Granted there is an decent story arc to follow (though the ending was a letdown), and a great soundtrack, but it's too little if, like me, you don't embrace the main gameplay. So while still respecting the dev's decisions and applauding their great execution, i still give this game a negative recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Since Steam opened up Chinese region, a large number of Chinese players entered Steam. They no longer play pirated games, but pay for genuine games. Based on the huge population and excellent quality of the game, adding Chinese language support is clearly a win-win option, with a low cost in exchange for unparalleled reputation and substantial revenue, game makers really should consider it carefully. And as far as we know, compared to the quality of the game, the Chinese players prefer pay for the games which have Chinese language - even though it is not particularly good.

												Monaco has one of the most unique gameplay combinations I have played, its filled with indie pixely goodness, but also has a detailed ""stealth"" system along with 4 player co-op and a level editor makes for near endless fun. Monaco doesn't let its art style hold it back from telling a story either, throughout the campaign you will learn about the characters and what motivates them. The protagonists are each there own character with there own ""personality"", something I would think hard to do given the graphical style of the game. I think you should give Monaco a try.

It has its moments, but for a long while, the game is just too easy.

												Monaco is a good stratagey/stealth game. I suggest you and a couple of buddies play this game together but its not neccasary. The art style is unique and the music fits the atmosphere. Not very plot heavy but I would still recomend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is a quirky action game with a special emphasis on coop. The top-down, stylized presentation offers a lot of opportunities for gameplay and the game makes the most of it. You unlock a roster of characters, each with their own special abilities, and progress through an campaign of daring heists, mishaps and capers.What you need to do is watch the official trailer for the game, then imagine that the sweet, colorful chaos you saw in the trailer actually makes sense after 30 minutes of play and is satisfying to pull off, both solo and with friends. If you then see a game you like, go ahead and buy Monaco, you won't regret it.			",546,285,26,69,45,4,63

												Not really very good.Too fast paced/arcadey for good cooperation and the artstyle inteferes with gameplay. Certain classes are massively overpowered and others next to useless (a major problem in any coop game).Almost everything you can do in the level (knocking out or even killing guards, hacking computers) resets either after a short timer or when someone finds the body and even the players may be revived infinitely. In addition the vast majority of classes are only really given a small bonus to an ability anyone can do. If anyone can pick a lock being able to pick it slightly faster isn't THAT useful.All of this combined makes it much more likely/effective to simply have each player rush around alone than work together to come up with a proper plan. There is no real punishment for losing players since someone else can do the same thing (though a little more slowly) until you revive them again. Sure you COULD play the game as 'intended' but why? Yes, maybe it does magically get better towards the end but I can't see it being worth the♥♥♥♥♥♥before it. Fixing bad underlying design with 'good' level design is not acceptable.The trailer (video on this store page) is completely unrepresentative of how the actual game plays in coop. As mentioned by others (and indeed at the start of this review) the art style makes it difficult to tell what is actually going on and isn't particularly pretty in its own right.Maybe if you put significant hours into it you'll get used to the art style, only play the 'good' levels/play for score and speed etc but that is not an argument in favour of the game. It is advertised as a cooperative heist game (similar to, say, Swat 4 or Chaos Theory coop in design). Instead it is a fast paced arcade-style game with multiple flaws.			",325,24,3,50,26,2,78

												People sit in lobby unready to play and there isn't an option to kick them. Stealth isn't really important as everyone just runs around collecting coins whether or not there's guards or traps. It's just a race to see how fast to get the level complete.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay....I'll admit it.   For a long time I didn't like Monaco because it just felt strange to me.   It's an acquired taste (As one of my friends said in his reviews).But after many heists with friends, I must make a confession....I LOVE THIS BLOODY GAME!!!!!It's not too good in single player, but when you're playing with friends, the chaos becomes your new best friend!You can relate this game to a top-down Metal Gear game, but with a charm of it's own.BRILLIANT story-telling.BEAUTIFUL music.WONDERFUL chaos.FUN gameplay.GREAT mechanics.If this game is not in your library, then why are you even on Steam?!If you meet me in a server, be ready for a good time.   But don't forget........what's yours is mine!			",262,77,12,21,24,7,23

												A fantastic and fun co-op experience that can lead to absolute hilarity when it all goes wrong.  That said, when it all goes right and you get the loot and get out its an immensely satisfying experience, especially as the difficulty ramps up in the later levels.			",241,20,31,25,35,2,40

The stealth system is well designed and the game is a lot of fun with friends.But the whole playerbase is pretty much 7 years old so prepare yourself for a lot of screaming on online play.

												Greatest lips ever. It was as if they had coldsore blisters all over them. Plus, having multiple lips in the same area is not only enthralling but also endearing. It made everything that much more fun. Never sure if one lip would do what you needed it to at the right time, or noticing as a random lip would quiver and the blisters would pop and spray all over the other lips. Coop at it's best. A shining achievement in blister history. I'd give it five full lip blisters and a quarter pus filled sack -- have fun!			",31,8,0,2,1,0,3

What I liked:  Missions start out easy, but get more difficult later on  Every character has a good use, some are better on certian missions ( I liked the Cleaner)  Has mod support  It's a great stealth game, how many of those exist?What You Need to Know:  You would be lucky to find anyone playing this game  I tried singleplayer, wasn't bad, just not the true way to play   You need a good team, because you everyone has to escape, so one person can ruin the gameMy Score:BPaid: Included in a bundleCompleted in: Couldn't find people to play ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is Quite a long review but nevermind...I was and still am a huge fan of monaco but i had onlt completed it on the xbox, and i mean 100% unscathed, bring the bleach all levels completed with all trophies but 1 which was multiplayer and after about 1.5 years i gave up.Then when i bought monaco on the PC i thought it would be nice to try it but i feel the zombies mode has ruined the aspect of monaco, not in the sneaky-ness of it because now you have to be even more sneaky but from the fact the zombies mode seems quite... off for monaco as it is set in france, meant to be a game about stealing (zombies still is but does not feel the same) murder if you can do it silently using a wrench or 7 and getting those SWEET trophies is still there but doing it against the watchmen, THAT HELICOPTER! (you know the one if youve played the game...) and the dogs feels like its proper thievery but against zombies its just collecting coins, a faded screen and 2 zombies called margo and pierre (im assuming the two computer people) just grunting and walking past zombies.*RANT ENDED*But other than that Monaco is a game i will for ever cherish, for its story of which for all my life has never beaten my love for itSOOO... i highly recommend you purchase monaco but if your into completing it as in multiplayer, single player unscathed and cleaned out from head to toe get the xbox version for i think it is better!

What I liked:  Missions start out easy, but get more difficult later on  Every character has a good use, some are better on certian missions ( I liked the Cleaner)  Has mod support  It's a great stealth game, how many of those exist?What You Need to Know:  You would be lucky to find anyone playing this game  I tried singleplayer, wasn't bad, just not the true way to play   You need a good team, because you everyone has to escape, so one person can ruin the gameMy Score:BPaid: Included in a bundleCompleted in: Couldn't find people to play ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is great! Litterally when I was just on the few couple levels I was just confused and screaming since I didn't know what I was doing xDMonaco is addicting, really fun and just wow... xD It really got me into the game where you get in the game and it was just going madman! Straight into to game, heaps of drama while stealing + escaping just got really catchy! Doing different gamemodes and such got pretty fun too I mean who wouldn't like this game? (Except for some people) But Still!Single Player is very challenging but being able to connect with 2-4 players on levels make it easier and also fustrating in a good way. I rate 9/10 because I mean yes it's awesome but there isn't much of variety of levels except for the workshop, but who knows how good the workshop ones are. If you are reading this and are about to buy the game or anything. I REALLY SUGGEST YOU DO!!! *Amazing :D*			",19,4,1,0,2,0,0

												Monaco is a great stealth action-packed game. You take the role of 8 different thieves with very different gameplay through two campaigns and great number of challenges. The gameplay is solid. While you can pretty much force your way through the first levels, you really must avoid getting caught later on. The difficulty of the second campaign is quite hard, with a lot of achivements to go for. While the game is great in solo, it really shines in coop multiplayer, where each player control a different thief. There's also versus multiplayer, which is great fun too. Monaco also has a very fitting soundtrack and a very interesting storyline, mostly because of the way it is told. For those interested, there's also a great deal of community maps made with the very complete level editor in the game. The game recently recieved an update consisting of a reworked campaign and a zombie mode with new enemies. If you like stealth games, monaco really is a blast. I especially recommend it if you can find friends to play with.			",253,74,7,28,25,4,27

 DISCLAIMER:  This is the first time I write a review, so it's not  that  deep and may have some errors. Have fun!Ah, Monaco. The best place to relax, party, and get robbed by a monkey. This Top-Down 2D game is good, I like it, and like any other game, it has it's  pros  and  cons  . PROS: -Steam Workshop.-Steam Trading cards.-Cheap.-Original.-Nice History.-Nice Graphics. CONS: -Gets boring after you complete the game.-Zombies are sometimes too Overpowered.-Limited tiles and tile placement. (If you do know what I mean..)-There's a part in the history that is too Overpowered.So yeah! That's it. What's yours is mine, and this review, is  mine  .

												Where do I start with this game? Hmmm... Lets start with how foolish I was when I first bought this game. I bought it downloaded it and neglected it. I was too brash and thought this game was a complete bust when I first played it. After 2 years while I was cleaning out my dresser/closet/cupboard I found a completely black game case... it was Darkness 2. Ok then I found another completely black case it was Monaco. The game I bought 2 years back and neglected. I realised just looking at my gametime that I didn't really experience this game and didn't give it much of a chance compared to my other games. I quickly re-downloaded Monaco and started it up. First thing I noticed, the beautiful soundtrack, I sat there listening for a while just appreciating this captivating melody. Then I actually started playing the game. The mechanics were a little bit strange to me at first compared to games such as Hotline Miami, Hero Seige, etc. but I slowly got used to it. Instead of breaking down doors and killing everyone at once. I had to take my time planning out my way of entry and exit, which character to play as, what to do once I get in and how to get out again once the objective is complete similar to a game called Gunpoint. I felt pretty good when I was able to complete an entire level without raising any suspicion and setting off any alarms. I felt like a true sneaky and sly thief. The games mechanics were pretty much flawless. Each character had very useful abilities. No one was useless. Singleplayer is somewhat completable through some paitence and perseverance (Best classes are The Cleaner and The Gentleman.). There is always a way to complete a level even if things seem a little bit shaky. So it's pretty fair to new players. In multiplayer, it is much more easier and much more crazier when someone messes up and you need to save him/her from a crazy situation (You can't ditch people and just complete the mission without them.). Ok this game isn't perfect but it is still one of the better and balanced games out there. The AI is somewhat lacking. In zombie mode if you play The Cleaner you can just literally go around assassinate everyone as the zombies don't get knocked out but just die. The Pickpockets Monkey range is a bit weak it only steals the money in a very minute range (it is still very useful for laser rooms and well guarded areas nonetheless.). The Lookouts highlighting ability could be improved maybe revealing the guards posts and paths would be useful (She reveals guard type and the infrastructure of the map. Still very useful.). The Hacker should also have extended time for the virus' and that go around shutdown lasers and electronics. (He hacks and fast and can create virus' from the outlets. Still very useful.). The Gentlemans disguise is too limited and is broken way too easily. (He is still my favourite stealth class. He just requires a bit of skill and patience to play as.). The Redhead can charm one enemy at a time but they should add some sort of mechanic that depending on who she charms she gets some sort of ability (So adding to the fact she can use guards to open locked doors. Maybe civilians can add some sort of disguise mechanic.).Alright I'll stop rambling and end this review. Whether people read this or not (I hope they do.). All I am getting at this review is that. You shouldn't judge something before you truly know your judgement is thorough and proven.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whether a casual pick up and go gamer or a hardcore computer wizard, Monaco has something for everyone. With a gentle learning curve but a painfully difficult proficiency requirement near the end of the campaign coupled with the arcade feel and deceptively intricate classes, this game holds appeal for those both playing for fun and those looking to leave no coin behind.

												Monaco is a well-made game with nice plot. It is best played in multiplayer, however, there is a problem with it - it becomes too hard to play very soon and levels are very tough. Therefore an average player quickly loses his interest in the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This Game is great the enemy AI is unpredictable the levels have a lot of replay value and most importantly the game is hard the first couple levels are fairly simple but in the later levels you really need to experiment with all the diffrent classes and that's some genuinely nice design because at that point the game changes into a stealth puzzle game instead of just a stealh game this genre was never really something I played a lot mainly because I couldn't find any games to play that were based purely on stealth and decision making in most stealth games you can perform takedowns or other things of that type but this game only has one character that can do that which is really great it means you have to rely heavily on your enviroment instead of the normal hey you've got 50 diffrent gadgets that you can use to not get spotted and take this guy down without anybody noticing so yeah long story short this game has it all the sound design ( that actually uses real life sounds ) the character variety, the stealth, etc. so basically to conclude Monaco is a great game and I would recommend it a lot heck I probably forgot like half of the features of this game because there is just so much to talk about and there is a lot of quality to be found in every single one			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is Quite a long review but nevermind...I was and still am a huge fan of monaco but i had onlt completed it on the xbox, and i mean 100% unscathed, bring the bleach all levels completed with all trophies but 1 which was multiplayer and after about 1.5 years i gave up.Then when i bought monaco on the PC i thought it would be nice to try it but i feel the zombies mode has ruined the aspect of monaco, not in the sneaky-ness of it because now you have to be even more sneaky but from the fact the zombies mode seems quite... off for monaco as it is set in france, meant to be a game about stealing (zombies still is but does not feel the same) murder if you can do it silently using a wrench or 7 and getting those SWEET trophies is still there but doing it against the watchmen, THAT HELICOPTER! (you know the one if youve played the game...) and the dogs feels like its proper thievery but against zombies its just collecting coins, a faded screen and 2 zombies called margo and pierre (im assuming the two computer people) just grunting and walking past zombies.*RANT ENDED*But other than that Monaco is a game i will for ever cherish, for its story of which for all my life has never beaten my love for itSOOO... i highly recommend you purchase monaco but if your into completing it as in multiplayer, single player unscathed and cleaned out from head to toe get the xbox version for i think it is better!

The characters are great for that extra help you need in the game (I like thee pickpocket, as he can just be in a room and Hector, his mokey, can take everything).You cant anticipate the next move of anyone in the levels, which adds to the excitement and suspense.

												I've never really played a game quite like Monaco. It is more about stealth than it is fighting. It makes you think about where to go next because you might get caught. The soundtrack is amazing. My metaphorical hat goes off to Austin Wintory, the composer. This game is a blast to play with friends. There will be the woe of almost beating a level and then dying because of some stupid reason (example: your friend was AFK.). There will also be the joys of beating a level when you've been working so hard and you know that you have only gotten that far because of the help of your comrades. Single player is also fun because of the thought that you're challenging all these people by yourself. While the graphics seem all pixelated, but they have a certain charm. Oh, and the French voices are a nice touch.9.5/10Complete it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game excels at being a frantic multipllayer game where if stealth didn't work, run. Alll the levels have a twist and a new perk to them, which makes the game never boring. The characters are great for that extra help you need in the game (I like thee pickpocket, as he can just be in a room and Hector, his mokey, can take everything).You cant anticipate the next move of anyone in the levels, which adds to the excitement and suspense. The music is great, the graphics suit the design of the game, and the gameplay is fantastic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The soundtrack is amazing at building up tension during each level and just trying to get through the level without getting detected is very thrilling. 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not sure what all the hubbub is about.I gave this game two shots to impress me but I just don't see the appeal. First I played it with the keyboard online with a stranger and then the next day I tried it solo with a controller, both sessions were about 45 minutes. I came away from both bored.At its core Monaco is a pretty basic stealth game with a silly tone to it. There's a little bit of story before each level but it doesn't take itself seriously nor should you. I didn't see anything worth caring about. The majority of players probably skip it altogether. The guards you'll spend your time avoiding also have a bumbling way of acting that adds to the droll atmosphere.I did like how each character you choose to play as has a unique special ability that enhances their gameplay in some way. I even enjoyed a few chases at times when I did get caught. However, with most chases I never felt like I was in much danger. I have read that many multiplayer rounds devolve into free-for-all sprints through the level with no regard to stealth and I can see why. There's really only two things to do in each level: collect coins and reach the exit. As far as I can tell coins only add to your score on an online leaderboard which I'm probably not alone in not caring about.Without an interesting story, likable characters, deep gameplay or enjoyable goals to strive for I couldn't find enough to keep me playing Monaco.

YouTube™ Video: Monaco STTP Review by Kenuty 

			Views: 63		

			Here is my review of Monaco, My first indie thrown up and will throw up more! enjoy guys, STTP as usual stands STRAIGHT TO THE POINT, my new review done quick, and straight ot the point lol, if you...		

This is a great game for those who enjoy top bottom heist, You have to actually try it to see if you like it or not because the video cannot do this game the justice it deserves. Also coop is a blast with friends, but wild with pugs, YOLO+catchy tunes+Very fun gameplay+awsome multiplayer if you set it up+Great concept, hope to see a better sequel, hours of fun and replayability, change up your path and class- Pugs can ruin game without communication- Multiplayer can be hard to find players, no real replayability except ranking and the path you take- Trolls will mess your game up			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is absolutely phenomenal. It's great if you have friends that can play with you, and even better if you can talk to eachother whilst playing it. This game is my game of the year 2013 and game of the year 2014 so far! I love this game so much, but my only knack is the dodgy level editor system. It's controls are somewhat flawed, but if I could navigate it with my mouse then I feel that it would be greatly improved. Buy this game and share it with your friends!P.S. I have taken the liberty of creating a group for our Monaco friends by the name of Voleurs De La Nuit. Please join us and invite your friends to have even more fun in Monaco!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game is fun but the later levels get quite rediculous so much thta just killing 1 person will end up alerting the entire map and guards and civilians can revive each other which makes it even more annoying and ammo is hard to come by aswell even though the game goes overkill on guards and lasers making it way too hard to stealth too so gameplay boils down to running through guards alarms gun turrents on suicide runs to grab as many trophies as possible before you die then running to the escape vehicle until eventually theres no place to hide and too many defenses to get through			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not worth $3.74, definitely not worth 14.99. Anyone who wants it, watch some playthroughs, ask anyone who has it, it really isn't worth your money.

This is were it all goes down hill) OK! After waiting for around 10 -15 minutes for the game to put me in a lobby, which it never did, I thought ... You know what, I'll try Offline Mode, but NO! You have to have IRL people around your house to play. So finally, I don't really have much to say about gameplay and soundtrack, but i bet they are amazing, but i nver had a chance :( pitty			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the worst overhyped game ever made. If you read the other reviews you'll see it's recommended by people with as low as 0.6hrs playtime. So what is Monaco? Monaco is a coin collecting simulator. Imagine pacman, but you've got a gun, and also the ghosts pose 0 threat and don't come back to life. That's Monaco in a nutshell. Stealth? Oh sure, you can stealth through the game. But it's very easy to screw up and set the alarms off, at which point stealth is over and it switches to being one of the easiest shooters ever made. It's just such a laid back game, there's very little consequences for doing anything wrong. The game practically plays itself. Your objective is mainly just to tilt the control stick in the direction of coins then sit back and relax. Want proof Monaco is a poor game? Take a look at the global achievements. Less than 0.9% of people have finished the second act of the campaign; and I'll tell you it's definitely not because it's too hard.It boggles the mind how this game managed to get such amazing reviews as it did; really says a lot about the quality of mainstream reviews nowadays.

												This is a single player now. I read that there was a competition for this game but so few people entered it that it was canceled. I could be wrong but I know multiplayer doesn't last long on games like this. That's normally the best part in these types of games, and now it's dwindled down to nothing. I use the word dead to describe this. It's sad but it's true. Unless you want to play the solo missions they're fun but muliplayer was better and its gone now. I wouldn't buy this game anymore not to spite anyone but because you won't get anything out of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played the first levels of the first storyline with a couple of friends. I haven't enjoyed it as I thought I was going to.The game, if you play it as a proper thief, is good for its sale price ($ 2.54), but it can get pretty annoying (sometimes funny, though) if you play it reckless. I would not pay its full price ever.I think I was expecting something more from the hour and a half that I have played. If you think of buying it just consider of telling your friends to get some copies so you can have a better time.2.9/5 for 1.5 hours played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Top-down 2D stealth.  It's pretty meh.  The stealth itself is pretty silly with guards getting bored after chasing you, not following you to new areas, and reviving their fellow guards without giving much of a damn.  BUT, it features full 4 player co-op campaign on all levels and full steam workshop support with tons of extra content.  Worth the asking price and could be a fun time running around while setting off hundreds of alarms.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Singleplayer or Co-op heist game"", key word being singleplayer. No. It's not singeplayer orientated. Singleplayer and co-op have the same maps, same amount of enemies, except you're by yourself. I'm sure this game would be fun with friends to play it, but in my curcumstance this game is not fun, AT ALL. It's massively unbalanced. So much so that it's ridiculous, especially when guards can resurrect each other, despite taking a direct hit to the chest with the full slug from a shotgun. If you like a hard-as-Dark-Souls challenge then by all means buy it, if not don't get it, unless you have friends to play with. At least I got it for $2.54			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Seems like it would be a fun coop game but I just couldn't get over the art style.  It is the worst use of the retro pixel style I have ever seen in a critically acclaimed game. The ugly doesn't bother me so much as it being not functional.  It's a struggle to tell the tile sprites apart while racing through the level: is that a shelf, a wall, a door, or something else?  I don't know, it all looks like placeholder programmer art.   Even after playing for hours I wasn't able to tell what certain things were without stopping and thinking about it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can appreciate the difficulty in bringing a quality indie concept to fruition, but that doesn't excuse a game from being compelling. At first blush it's a fun little romp which friends can join in on, but it quickly dissolves into an almost meaninglessly easy sprint. It's a stealth game in which stealth is not required, enemies are not particularly lethal, and your characters move blindingly fast. You can easily sprint through all the alarms and trail every guard behind you on the way in and out of each heist, ignore almost all of the loot, and be none the worse for wear. Loot is needed only for high score, and who really cares? All this without mentioning the abilities that make it even easier, especially the Miner character who literally can tunnel around all the obstacles in a level and walk out unscathed. No reason to go stealthy, no reason to really play, actually.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is gonna be thumbsed down to hell because my opinion is different than yours and im not allowed to not like it even though I personally cant recommend it and you won't even give me a chance and read the reviewStraight up can't play it. The concept is amazing, I'm really liking the concept but whats lacking is the execution, the art style is just so terrible to look at, I can't tell whats going on, I don't know who is who, when I'm running around in panic I can't for the life of me figure out what the hell is going on. The objective is confusing too and theres a random story or something for some reason. Thats my only gripe with the game, if the game was re-released with a much more simpler, less blocky and colorful art style and make it not so busy to look at like i'm about to have a seizure, then I'll play the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game, but for my own sanity, i'm not going to recommend it because its horrible to look at in its current state.

												As of now, I can't really recommend Monaco.It's definitely a fast paced, incredibly fun game. It's definitely fun to sneak around, figure out how to take out guards, and recruit new characters.however, there is a lot of emphasis on multiplayer, and, well, unless you have friends, online is pretty much dead. characters that you play are very single strength, so there are certain missions that are extremeley difficult to pull off unless you know which character is good and how to play them well.overall, grab it while it's cheap, or if you really enjoy a challenge + stealth, I can't recommend this game enough.

												Monaco as a whole is a very interesting and fresh concept. However its executed poorly.I never played the singleplayer as it was me and 2 friends (plus a random player) playing together, the multiplayer is insanely unstable, we would barely beat a level before one of us disconnecting, we all tried making the lobby to see if that helps but someone would always end up disconnecting. The game would occasionally just crash anyway.What little time we could play in it, it was fun other than the fact its really hard to distinguish who's who besides a slight difference in colour.The game could be good if it weren't for the instability.

So I bought this game and started downloading it with a big smile on my face. When the downloading is completed, I opened the game and started a match. I was waiting and people were just joinning and leaving and I couldnt start to play. After I figured out that there's an option to play offline, I started the game. The character had a delay in movement and crosshair (I mean mouse) and the gameplay was all about moving from a place to place, collecting some golden things and avoiding guards (Wich is impossible in some levels). When guards are chasing after you, they will start saying things in French and that's very annoying.  Now let me tell you the pro's and con's:Pro's:1. The game itself looks high-quality and makes a feeling of an old&new game at the same time. 2. Field of view looks very cool and makes the game more ""realistic"", wich means you cant just notice all the guards, you'll need to look at them somehow.Con's: 1. Gameplay is same, you'll just need to listen to some convention in the start, and then do the mission. The mission are really boring because the lack of content, you'll find yourself interacting with doors / other things. 2. Sounds are really annoying, especially the one that the guards does.3. A really big amout of levels as a story line, wich makes no sense at all. This game may be cool if it was free, I'd better donate to charity the money I wasted on this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recieved this game as a gift a while ago, and from around 90m of co-op gameplay, I cannot stand this game, not one bit. I liked the layout of the menus and their bright intense color on black, contrasting the giant pixels to the max.However, the gameplay in my opinion is extremely repetitive, and the game kind of ""forces"" you to stealth the joint.In this I mean how you may have a shotgun, you can go in and blow someone to their pixely skeleton, however note that you can only use it once, before having to collect 10 stupid coins to load another use into your weapon/tool. And by the time I collected 10 coins, I had about 20 stupid Watchmen following me, tripping lasers as I ran, and doctors shooting me with tranquilizer crossbows, which led to me being beaten to death with the deadly forks the Watchmen hold. Sure, you can try to hide in a bush/vent/tree, but by the time I went in one, they followed me to the bush and happened to poke the bush with their forks, leading me to my instant death.The music, in my opinion, is awful, just sounding like an extremely sped up piano ballad, or better yet a 2-year-old banging their hands and arms on every key possible. The graphics are squares. I think everything is a square. Your body is a big square, with a smaller square (the head, which stupidly bobbles left and right any time you move your mouse), and two little squares (the arms) on the side of the big square. Despite this I do like the lighting effects and post-processing. The animations are like pixel ragdolls.. It's strange.There are different characters to choose from, all with different abilities. I thought that it was cool, being able to have a specialty and all. You start off with 4 at the beginning, and get more as you progress through the campaign.Also, I just want to throw out there that if you want to go up a staircase, ladder, etc., you have to ""prepare"" it first, and once it's ""prepared"", you need to wait for ALL players to go there in order to go up. Hated waiting.Overall? 4/10.. Others may like this game, but I sure as hell don't. I'll give them points for originality, but that's it. It's not my kind of game.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was described to me as being a mix of Payday 2 and Hotline Miami... I don't see a relation to either. This game is painful to look at. Half the time I'm staring at the screen trying to figure out what I am even looking at. Look at the pictures shown above and try to explain to me what I'm looking at. This game is a good concept, but it is extremely overrated. You can beat most levels just by navigating to the exit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The video for this game made it look a whole lot more fun then it is. For most of the game there is no point in sneaking as blasting through levels running from guards is less frustrating and way faster. It feels like there is really no point in trying to sneak and make the game work the way it's meant to be played when it's frustrating, dull and the game encourages you to complete levels as fast as possible. You won't be playing as all the characters mainly because it feels like a lot were added as filler and their perks are out classed by other characters.

												Maybe I haven't yet invested enough time in this game to appreciate what it offers, but some friends and I tried to just jump in and we were not enjoying it. A slightly better tutorial would probably be nice. The game really just keeps throwing new stuff at you expecting you to know what's going on, and for my friends who never even play stealth games, it became a huge hurdle. I can definitely see a fun game in here, but it's not very accessible as-is.Edit: I also totally forgot to mention the terrible interface and options. Why can I not start a room for friends only? I had to kick Shrek out of my room about five times before my friend could finally join. I don't like saying no to Shrek.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wanted to like this game. The setup is perfect, arcadey-style thief game with different classes and interesting level design. The one downfall is the visual language. I feel like everything is giving this gradient glowy style that blurs into each other. Instead of having things be clearly defined they are really hard to spot. I know this game wants you to panic and be stressed out with each situation, yet I can barely make out what's going on. I stopped playing once I came to this realization.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A sneak-em-up, top down game which is fun with both friends and even alone.For a while. The game involves employing teamwork and tactics to disable security cameras, steal items and subdue guards. At least, that's what it promises. Unfortunately, it's only too easy to just run through levels, shooting everything in your path, and to forget that the main aim of the game is to remain stealthy. The game is only fun alone for a short while, before levels become repetetive and monotonous. Playing the game with others was a great way to suppress this, until the playerbase became so small that you would have to wait in lobbies 1h+ before another player appeared.A good enough game when it was released, Monaco is now lying untouched in my library as it has done for some time.

												Monaco is a great concept gone horribly wrong. I got it as part of Humble Bundle 11, even paying extra for it alongside Antichamber. Antichamber is an epic journey into the mind that can't get enough reccomendation from me. Monaco is a failed attempt at a retro looking stealth game about heists. As you start it, it draws a mysterious air around itself, with, I'll admit, a pleasing retro aesthetic. And then you watch the cinematics. They're certainly not what the advertivements show. They're just the characters at hand sitting someplace taking turns spewing out TEXT-BASED dialouge while doing their stupid, 8-bit, repeating animations. The gameplay is clunky, and the retro aesthetic collapses in on itself when you can't tell what's a wall, what's a door, what's a plaza for you to walk into and yell out at the top of your lungs, ""HEY GUISE LOOG AND ME IM ROBB N. YOUR BANK!"" You can't tell what's going to break line of sight, what's going to get you noticed, what's going to - oh, wait, it doesn't matter, because you can just run past every guard, kill everyone, set off every alarm, ♥♥♥♥ up every lock-pick attempt (oops, that doesn't matter either cos it's just hold down a key and boom, lock picked) The outcome won't change, you won't get more reinforcements thrown at you, you won't lose money, or fail the mission unless every single one of you dies. It just gets more♥♥♥♥♥♥easy if you have a whole gang of friends at your side, because then, with each classes game-breaking ability, you hardly have to do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ It sadly fails, with all its' promise, at being a good action game, at being a good stealth game, at being a thriller, at being a good co-op game, all failed. The worst part is it's not actively bad, just plain boring, like a McDonalds hamburger: Far overpriced for the bland thing you get. 3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is okay at first. Run around collect gold end level. Most of the people you play with are raging idiots. They either don't try to be careful or they run through the level urging you to hurry up over and over again instead of letting you get a feel for the game. There's also no real progression other than unlocking a few new characters. So your basically just playing for score and i've never really been into arcade style games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My friends and I were looking for a co-op stealth game, and we came across Monaco. Quite generously one of them bought a copy for all three of us. We started playing through the main missions, having a lot of fun sneaking through the maps, silently taking out guards and what not. But then we started to realize that you didn't really need to sneak at all. You could simply run the through the level with abosolutely no consequences. In games like Mark of the Ninja or Hitman: Absolution, you're penalized for being seen, and in the latter even penalized for killing non-targets. With no points system in Monaco, there's no incentive to play it stealthily. Outside of a score, the levels themselves don't feel particularly rewarding. Very repetetive and easy to complete. I would recommend this game to a group of friends who just want something to play together and laugh about. However with no need to communicate or strategize I would not recommend this to anyone looking for an in-depth cooperative stealth game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is interesting in it's design.  You select one of a few unique characters with different abilities and attempt to achieve a goal, usually one pertaining to an overarching plot that you uncover as you progress.  Some stories unlock new characters with new abilities that may (or may not) help you during your next mission.  I loved the references and easter eggs in the game.  The developers certain put a lot of thought and creativity into the game.  That, unfortunately, is where the good ends.  The mechanics aren't consistent.  There are times when you can be standing almost right next to a guard who is staring at you and they will not react, even when in LOS.  Other times you can be standing in another room behind a wall walking softly and they suddenly become alert to something nearby (you).  Mixed with the fact that the characters don't have precise controlling (the gun aiming is atrocious), which makes things ridiculous when there are lasers that will trip alarms and the choice between hacking a computer or smashing through a wall is the same motion.  There were plenty of times I was trying to hack a computer right next to a laser and had to frustratingly inch my way up to the console so as not to slide right into the laser (when you let go of your movement key, your character keeps moving a small distance).  With some refinement, I'd say this game would be a most excellent and exciting co-op game.  As it is, me and my friends simply ended up frustrated and just dashing through the level to make it to the escapes or safe zone with no regard to who we alerted.  Needs more work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'd heard a lot of great things about Monaco so I decided to pick this game up.From what I can tell, it's a 2D heist game with a lot of stealth elements thrown in for good measure. Sadly, it seems like I may have decided to jump on the bandwagon a bit too late - looks like everyone's already gotten off. The online community for this game seems to be zero with a serious lack of diehards. Playing this game by yourself can only be fun for so long.I'd recommend getting this game only if you know for certain that you will have other people to play with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can even play with your friends, and with Shrek, but it will be terrible because you won't be able to see jack because the graphics be uglier than Dr. Eggman's armpit. In other words, this is solid for a Sonic game these days but I would advise that you pay no more than one dollar for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No incentive to actually steal stuff, which just leads to the following step-by-step program:1. The mole digs a hole in the wall and takes the trophy.2. You walk 2 meters to the escape zone.3. Repeat.No fun at all. The game is simply overrated.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I tried to like this game. But the graphics are so bad I can't tell what is happening on screen. Seriously. Weird art direction is one thing, outright indistinguishable blobs are another.Maybe there's a good game here. In fact, there probably is. But I can't play it if I can't follow what's going on the screen. So it gets a thumbs down for a truly hideous art & graphical style.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												eh... this game is boring to say the least. Pretty much you pick up a gun run past all the people and shoot everyone in your path, running with a gun is more effective then sneaking so it's really pointless, and you just run from point A to B and it gets boring very quick. I will say it has a nice artstyle and sound design but thats about it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I found this game very interesting and fun.  You strive to collect all the money in a mission (optional objective) while looking for a Trophy case (primary objective) you need to find and escape.  It's like a heist.   The first few hours, I was having a positive experience playing this game.  However, as time goes on, after completing missions here and there,   I have realized that  most of enjoyment I get out of this game are depending on how well-made the missions are.  How fun and challenging they are.   Some missions, I can run around attracting all the guards and still complete the missions,  I realize that isn't fun at all.    So I really suggest to restrict yourself to being a harmless ninja and try to loot everything and escape.  Everything else really fall just short.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Monaco: What's Yours is Mine"" is a top-down, 4-player CO-OP stealth/heist game inspired by the Oceans Eleven movies. Some have described the game a mix between stealth and PacMan, it being top-down and having to collect coins. PlotSeveral talented people felt they were wronged in their past lives and turned to crime claiming that the world ""owed them a debt"". Inevitably, all are arrested, and happen to be placed in the same prison where they consolidate their efforts. They meet a crimelord known only as ""The Gentleman""; a master of disguise, and are forced to help him rebuild his life after he too lost everything in exchange for a way out of Monaco, France, away from the police, and - finally - freedom. The dialogue is interesting and each character is given enough of a personality to be enjoyable without flooding the player with text. The story isn't too complicated, but it's few twists are enough to make you lean back in your chair and exclaim ""No, way!"" It's very well written and was a delight to hear.GraphicsThe fastest and easiest way to describe the graphics would be Minecraft's blocky, pixlated look. The visuals and art are wonderfully inspired and fun to watch. Same for the game's goofy animations (My favorite being the Red-Head girl's wave. A long, black stick represents her arm with a small block shifting left to right at the top. Another is the ""head box"" of the toons' body sliding left to right across the ""body box"" to look around.) Levels are colorful eye candy without being cluttered and hindering vision. The layout is still believable i.e. desks are in the right places, the insane asylum's layout makes sense and so on. Even the menus are well polished, organized, and easy to navigate. Unfortunately, you can't ""click"" on anything. Sorry, PC fans; it's the age of console ports. Arrow keys and Enter keys it is. SoundPerhaps Monaco's most proud feature is the sound design. From opening shafts/doors, to gathering/using items, the sound design is spot-on. Even when you die, you leave behind a skeleton that can be revived by allies. While being revived, it literally sounds like they are pouring flesh and blood back into you! It's so great!....if not, sometimes a little gross. The voice acting is equally commendable. Although our theiving protagonists don't make a peep beyond heavily breathing when their health is low, the guards are well-voiced and their dialogue is in pure french. Hearing a guard go ""What was that?"" can get old when it's in your native language, but hearing it in a foreign tongue makes the same line suprisingly facinating! However, beyond all this is the TRUE pride of Monaco's sound: the music. While undetected, the music is mostly piano that rouses a combination of silliness, and stealth. The tunes are dulcet with a personality of it's own. When you're caught, the music morphs to a reminiscent sound of Chaplin-esque, ragtime music. Imagine this: you and 3 friends lay out a detailed and complex plan of how to tackle the next puzzle, but EVERYTHING goes wrong! The alarm sounding, the guards sprinting to the scene, you and your team are panicking as you scramble to get away, slowly opening vent shafts and scurrying into bushes while this music plays. It's a feeling I can't describe beyond ""masterpiece"". So rarely does music and gameplay weave together to make such immersion like this. GameplayAll of the above would be wasted on a game if it's gameplay wasn't good, right? Monaco's gameplay is simple, yet brilliant. It plays very ""simply"" but is far from casual. The goal is to take an objective always symbolized as a giant trophy, but you can only unlock the next mission by gathering all the coins on said mission. You have a main ability, a secondary ability, the weapon/tool you take, and sneaking. That's it. Sounds shallow? In fact, it's not. The simple mechanics of the game leave it to be very controllable and follow a tight meta of teamwork. Therein is the brilliance of the simplicity. Some examples are: The Lockpick. He picks locks the fastest (omg nowai??) and his secondary is he opens safes and cash registers the fastest. The Look Out (My personal favorite) can spot enemies with radar-like precision across the entire map. She also unveils ""shroud"" to reveal the level to the otherwise blind team. Her secondary ability is to open vent shafts the fastest, providing an escape route for the whole team. Lastly mentioned is the Cleaner who can knock out guards if they aren't too suspicious of him. His secondary is using health kits the fastest. There's several more, but you get the idea. They are all powerful, yet not omnipotent, forcing a reliance on others without making anyone feel useless. Teamwork in games is rarely captured this perfectly. The online functionality is also smooth as butter. Connecting to games is a breeze and I rarely experience lag that breaks the game.The VerdictMonoco: What's Yours is Mine is a superb display of game design, sound design, and gameplay mechanics. Charming visuals, hilarious and honeyed music, perfect sound, low price, and well polished gameplay make for a game that can't be refused. Monaco earns the coveted 10 out of 10 from me! It's that elusive indie gem we've all been searching for!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It’s multiplayer-only and there are no explanations.EDIT: Someone in some forum explained to me how to switch to single player mode, and I’ve been able to actually play this game. The developers somehow thought that hiding the option and making multiplayer the default was a good idea. You need to have a gamepad and press START to switch to single player.Anyway, I haven’t enjoyed the game much. Sorry for the lack of details, it’s been a while since I played it. The game didn’t have big flaws that I can remember, except that it wasn’t fun for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A chaotic and nauseating mess of systems that don't mesh well or evolve in any way. A madcap dash to collect and escape without any real ability or need to plan and strategize. I've tried so hard to give this game a fair shake and enjoy it but every time I come up short.			",91,22,0,6,4,1,6

												It's... interesting? It's kinda cool how the map is a floor plan until you can actually see it with your eyes, I guess, although that takes some getting used to. Basically expect everything to go swiftly to hell, which is sort of part of the fun. I really dislike the sound design, especially how it's kind of like some French guy is yapping right into your ear the entire time. Iunno. It's worth playing with friends, but I'm not about to pick it up and go for it alone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Almost every critic has acclaimed this game as ""amazing"", 10/10 type of game.  Whatever acid they were on, send some my way.This game is pure♥♥♥♥♥♥  I was looking for a fun game to play with friends and after seeing such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ comments like ""One of the best co-op games of all time"", I thought, hell try out this game.What a steaming pile of garbage this game is.  It's crap graphics which is to be expected of any indie game.  That's easy to look past though if the game has fun, interesting gameplay.  Hell, even a great story might make it worthy of playing if the latter both fail.This game has zero of any of these elements.  It's not visually impressive.  It's not fun or even catchy gameplay.  There is zero story.  What the ♥♥♥♥ were these critics smoking??Jesus lord this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥  Rarely have I ever played game with friends where all of us, in sync, gave up on a game.  We reached this moment at about the 10 minute mark of playing this attrocity.  You know the PC gaming sector is sad when critics are acclaiming awful games like this as ""amazing"".  ♥♥♥♥ me I wish Steam had a return policy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Eh, Some decent gameplay alot of indie-games that most people like would definitely buy this, So far i don't like the game because all you have to do is walk and pick up coins your teammates will pick up first as in my experience, So essentially that shotgun item you first pick up is useless, Thus why this game has a hard learning curve for new players.Overall i wouldn't buy the game, I'm lucky i got it from someone else.

												I have been looking forward to playing this game since I grabbed a copy during the Steam sale at Christmas.  To say that I feel like I've been ripped off, even though this game only cost me £1.55 is an understatement.The art style is nice, but it's not easy to see what's going on, and very confusing.  I hate the idea of co-op play on any game, but this game is built around it.  Also, there is never little in the way of telling you what to do, and what is going on.  When you start a game for the first time you except a mini tutorial just to get you started and introduced to some of the basic game mechanics.  No such luck here.This game will live in my game library, and I doubt I'll ever fire it up again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is, without out a shadow of a doubt, one of the most boring games I have ever played. It should have a base price of $3.00, not $15.00. The gameplay is not as fast-paced as one would think a heist game would be. The story is mediocre and very stale. Even with friends, the game is still boring and tedious to play. If I could refund the six dollars I put into it, I would.2/10 would not recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was really excited to play this game after watching a let's play of it, but when I tried it out for myself it was pretty disappointing :( There weren't really any clear rules to the game? You had an objective but the gameplay itself was pretty messy and it was difficult to work with other players. Even joining a game was rather confusing? The lack of instructions kinda surprised me and it really dampened the whole game. In addition to that, everything seemed really repetitive and was pretty boring >__< ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Had rather high expectations about this game and unfortunately, they never reached that level. I think the biggest problem is the messy graphics thats becomes a big bowl of psychedelic effects when you are up to four players. But in the other hand, we probably play the game the wrong way as the game wanted us to play it. Instead of taking it easy so stressed we around in sheer panic. I will give it one more chance, but for now I can not recommend this game.			",145,97,2,13,9,1,25

												A top-down heist with multiplayer! Was interesting to play with friends, but ultimately didn't hold very much interest. Some of the visual cues (like guard sight range) were a little unclear and when combined with a sparse tutorial I overall felt like I was thrown into the deep end too soon. I could see it being fun if everyone in the group put the work into becoming proficient though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awesome. The gameplay, the music, the pixelized astetics, everything. Granted, this game is best played with friends, but if you have the patience to get through the game, each level you finish becomes one you can play with whoever is hosting that level. The Heists are fun and have a good learning curve. You can mess around all you want at the start, and even the slightest wrong move will kill you in the last levels.My favorite aspect of the game is the PvP. One on one, the gameplay is very tactical, and stratigic, if you're killed holding all the trophies, then you've basically lost. If you have the fortune to get in a lobby with two or three other people, then a riot will ensue, unless you've honed your skills, you will be constantly killed, and constanty be killing the other players. Matches can last a long time and be utterly epic when you win.Like others have said, get the four pack, and share it with your friends, or if you don't have any, just wait around for open lobbys to pop up. You won't regret it.(The music is epic too)			",20,2,0,0,3,0,1

												""Get in, get out, get rich."" What's not to like about a cooperative heist game? This fun game puts you and thee others in a fight to survive an onslaught of guards, dogs, security cameras, and doctors as you steal everything that's not pinned down. Each character has his or her own specialty (and colour) and adds his or her own personal touch to whatever missions you are running. The learning curve is a bit steep, but with some practice, what belongs to others will soon be yours.			",74,16,0,7,6,0,6

												Although playing by yourself may be alright, playing with multiple people is fantastic. You work as a team, using various classes, to pull off a heist. It has the potential to be tense and feels like you're a master criminal pulling off a heist, yet there are a few silly things and easter eggs that can break the tension and to provide hilarity. It may take a little bit to learn the game, but there are enough ""classes"" so you can find your niche. Playing it with friends makes it feel rewarding and worth it. I would definitely recommend this game if you and your buddies had a weekend to blow on a fantastic game.			",79,11,1,12,9,2,6

												I got this game during a massive steam sale, and I couldn't be happier...This has to be one of the most exciting 8-bit games I've ever played. The gameplay is very unique, although the concept is a mesh of several popular games. Love it so far, and the in-game editor and community created levels add to the replay value astronomically. Also, maybe it's not as important to everyone as it is to me, but the game is 100% functional offline. Major props to the devs for this one!			",112,14,3,16,12,1,16

In coop this game seems to be a complete anarchy without a real way of cooperating with other people. I bough it for some fun two player coop experience, but it's been such a repetitive and chaotic disappointment in the short time I played it that I do not really know if I am willing to give it another chance.

												If you like peforming daring heists while avoiding contact with night guards, Then Monaco is the game for you. Trying to stay hidden is challenging, and if you're a noob like me, you're going to get caught. But once you do, it ads a whole layer of intense fun to this game. I recomend this game to anyone who likes heists and keping quiet.			",48,5,0,2,3,0,3

												This is a fun, exciting game. It's not Payday, nor is it Left 4 Dead, but it's a fast paced multiplayer experience just the same. While it may be tough to get into if you're not used to overhead 2D graphics, it's quite enjoyable once you get used to it.My main greivance is the lack of a single player mode, and that you need to play with others. If you're as bad as I am, it's embarrasing to die in front of others. Yet, I understand that programming AI for a heist game is pretty tough, and must be even more so for indie devs.If you're not into playing face paced, quick games; this is not the game for you. However, if you're willing to give it a try, you'll find this game to be more than enjoyable, and what it lacks in a single player mode, it more than makes up for in the artistic sytle and captivating environment and music it provides.Overall, I give it a 4.25/5.

												Alone, Monaco is a solid top-down stealthy crime game, but it's probably at its most fun to  fail  play with friends. I had equal fun running coordinated team break-ins as much as I did arguing with everyone when everything eventually goes wrong.It had a lot of free content like PvP, map builders, and extra storyline campaigns pumped in since its release and it's all pretty good. If you see the 4-pack on sale, I'd try to get some people in on it.			",136,23,0,24,3,0,6

												This game rocks. You have a couple of guys, they all got their specialty and you need to break in to houses/banks/exhibitions and all kinds of other places. Get in. Get the objective loot, and the coins if you want to get rich, or die trying. Get out. Multiplayer is as much fun, if not more than the singleplayer.

There are different classes you can choose from, find the one that suits your style. This game is pretty cool with an interesting story and vary people who talk to you in game. Complete with the workshop to continue the game even after the story is over. Also go back to previous levels and beat the record speed. Fun game, great multiplayer.			",71,11,0,6,7,0,6

												This game is well-designed, in terms of balancing between single- and multiplayer play. The former, while difficult, leaves a great sense of satisfaction to the player upon completing a level. It's hard enough to make you ask your friends to play alongside you in intense teamwork-focused action. Aside from that, the graphics and sounds are great, and the replay value is superb!

												It's okay. I wouldnt pay more than a cheap sale price for it (I paid like $1.50 or something). It's a top down game w/ pixelated graphics and it's very simple. Theres 4 classes (locksmith, etc.) and you do these missions where you traverse through structures of traps and bad guys to achieve goals like getting an item or saving some guy.I don't want to rate it poorly b/c it didn't dissapoint me. My expectations were low given it was a cheap game, but overall compared to what other games are available and what you could be spending your time playing, this is pretty boring.

												Extremely fun and challenging multiplayer game, with the right combination of stressfulness and entertainment that keeps you wanting to play it. I haven't had a whole lot of play time with it, but that's mostly because I want to experience the game with a full party and not just by myself like a lonely loser. Playing with friends is surprisingly balanced for a multiplayer game, and even if everyone has different classes, the game is still difficult and it requires a lot of communication and coordination with your team to get through the heists - that is, if you plan on getting out with everyone alive. Very nice, very pretty, very fun, I can't say I have a single bad thing to say about this game. 10/10 would play again.			",36,5,0,10,8,0,4

												A great game to play solo, and an even better one to play with your friends. You basically try to steal things through five playable characters with different skills. The layout of the game is very simple yet elegant. Controls are basic and easy to understand and the vibrant colors make you want to continue playing. However, the levels eventually become so difficult that it becomes infuriating...			",43,9,0,2,2,0,2

												monaco was very dissapointing.in the singleplayer you can barely do anything because of the class system.in multiplayer its too easy because you can do everything.people you know out only stay knocked out for a very short time.guards can bring other dead guards back to life. making a run and gun approach (which is an option in most levels) almost impossible. and it gets very repetitive fast			",264,45,2,32,16,2,32

												This is a fun game that can be played in co-op with up to 4 players. It starts easy and gets progressively more challenging. There are tons of extra maps for it in Steam Workshop so even if there is replayability in the main campaign, you are not limited to that option once you completed the game.I would reccommend it especially if you get a few friends to commit to buy it and play it together.

Its really special how each character has his/her different skills - such as the Mole, the Hacker, the Lookout, etc. (The Lookout is my fav btw, because she can detect enemies in the darkness and from far. :)) How it also has different modes is really interesting - like you could change it from classic to zombie to enhanced and so on. The weapons that you can obtain throughtout the game are also really awesome - like the shotgun, bomb, crossbow, etc~ :D In any case, the background and the characters that are made from large pixels make the game even more intriguing. :D I give it a 4.5/5.

												Monaco on a free weekend, Sure I will try it. and I was not dissappointed.The retro and simplified graphics on this stealth game add a quirky charm. you control a merry band of thieves, con artists, hackers, etc. Each with their own power ups and abilities. Your overall goal, to make off with as much loot at possible in as short of time as possible while avoiding death by angry guards with nightsticks.The story line is engaging, and the game teaches you by playing. No annoying pop ups, no pausing the game. Controls are easy to learn, and you don't find yourself sprawled all over the keyboard.Multiplayer Mode is a blast, you can go through the stories and work together, or go free for all in a race to come out on top.My only problem with the game... Not owning a copy... yet.			",38,23,0,16,17,1,18

												Monaco is probably one of the best co-op experiences to be found on Steam. It is very easy to pick up, yet difficult to master all of it's fine nuances. The difficulty curve is well balanced (though some complain that it becomes too hard near the end, I personally disagree) and has plenty of content.When Monaco was launched, it only came with the main campaign. Now there are an additional two campaigns, (one retelling the events of the game in a new perspective, and one telling the backstory of each of the main characters) a Zombie mode for all missions and a higly robust level creator. There is a final campaign coming as well.The pixelated, minimalist graphics style is bursting with tiny visual effects and charm. Your mind tends to fill in the gaps where the graphics don't give detail, further adding to the charm of hiding in bushes to evade guards.The sound is also fantastic. The music contributes to the atmosphere and the sound effects are meanigful as well.The co-op play is best experienced with friends in the same room. After a brief time of figuring out the game, players will be trying different strategies and utilizing each of hteir abilities to clear the levels. Having each player be a different character helps to have each player feel like they are making a meaningful contribution to the team. However, with more players, the chances of one player being spotted increaces, which makes for some of the best moments. One player being chased leads to another, and another. If you're looking for a great co-op experience, Monaco is highly recommendable.			",104,8,3,3,3,1,13

												Absolutely love this game. The soundtrack is perfect, the online and solo play is fun - and sometimes tedious (in a good way though). I would recomend this to anyone! It's pretty much like a puzzle, having to escape from the attention of the guards and turning off computers along with the lights. It's great.			",16,4,0,0,2,0,0

												Experience on Linux:+ No issues at all so far.Game:You move around in a 2D maze filled with obstacles. Available tools and strategy will take you through. There's sort of a class system where you can choose your type of player, each has advantages and some unique skillsets. So far it seems to be a matter of personal preference as all the maps I've played can be finished with either ""class"".This is a fun game and it has nice multiplayer support. I don't like the graphics, they get messy at times, but it's managable. The game is super fun to play, even though populated sessions can be hard to find, not enough players. The music is also fun. If you dig hardcore puzzle and stealth games, this is the one to play.Score:4/5			",50,10,1,3,8,0,1

												Squirrel's seal of approval: GoldWhy I played: One of my irl friends got a four pack so me, him, and 2 other irl friends could play monaco together on release. I will admit that I was surprised by how good this game was.Should you play:  If it is on a sale, it is a great buy. If you like stealth and co-op games this is for you. Even if you don't play much indie games like me, you should have some fun. Recommended controller input: Keyboard/Mouse, Xbox stylye controllerPros+Great art style+Great soundtrack+Extremely well balanced classes+Good stealth mechanics+Good UI+Easy to pick up and play+Good controls+Funny dialogue+Good level design+Great co-op+Extremely easy to provide developer inputCons+Repetitive+Not much fun without friendsRunabilityCan run on a toaster, trust me, burrito played it xDVerdictWhile this game is very fun, it does not last long. I do suspect my in-game time for this won't get much higher anytime soon, but I have to say this game is great.One of the great things about indie games is how it is usually way easier to voice your opinions to developers. In fact, with monaco, I know of some developers' steam accounts, so I can ask them questions or give feedback. It makes me feel like I am helping them achieve something, and it makes me feel good.9/10			",79,3,1,12,7,1,3

												1 Minute Review of Monaco.This is a great game with its retro arcade machine feel but the problem is when it comes to playing with strangers who don't appreciate the stealth aspects involved.  They can ruin the fun.Final WordBuy if you have 3 friends to play with or at least a friend... Buy a copy for them if they are cheap.Don't Buy if you have no friends, in which case you should probably be out socializing instead of playing games.			",101,17,5,16,37,1,24

												Overall, this simplistic game is an absolute gem. Sure you can pass a lot of levels by just running through, ignoring half of the loot and almost all the guards, but to do so is a waste. You will miss all the fun of sneaking around trying to pass each level without being seen/killed. Ok, single player has a limited lifespan, but multiplayer is great fun, and the ability to make your own maps extends the games life by a long time			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco has very simple mechanics: walk into things to use them, line of sight the gaurds/civs, and steal everything of value. The classes pretty much do the same thing as the next class can do but are specialized in some actions. Locksmith picks locks and safes fast, Pickpocket hides in bushes fast, etc etc. Some classes have special abilities as well, like Mole can dig into most walls, Redhead can charm enemies, etc etc.Unlike most stealth games, Monaco doesn't end when you're seen. Your score isn't based on how stealthy you are, but how fast you cleared the level with coins missed adding time. It's a ton of fun when you're with 4 people, alarms are going off, and everybody is disorganized.Despite the simple mechanics, it's a challenging game. Towards the end you're up against SWAT guys with shotguns who can pretty much 2-3 shot you from accross the room so STAY HIDDEN!UPDATE DEC 21 '13: I should note that the game comes out with free updates. Last update came new game mechanics like pickpocketing keys off gaurds to unlock doors in the mission or ""buttcash"" (people used to stand on top of coins, now they have wallets) which should have been in the game from the start but is in now. Last update also nerfed some of the difficulty in a lot of the missions in order to allow for all players to get through the game.			",491,160,5,61,40,5,50

For once, this game actually requires teamwork and strategy, the soundtrack is amazing, the style is stylish, the visuals are stunning, and the gameplay overall is hilarious and provides loads of fun. It's unlike anything you've ever player. Mostly worth for the co-op, while the singleplayer can still provide a very nice experience.

												I reccomend the game, but not the price. I got only about 2 hours worth of gameplay before it got boring, would I still play it again? Yes, but not fluently. To the creator, I mean no offense, but 5 dollars is the most I would pay for this game. 10 Dollars if you throw in a freemode (or just make the level creater a hell of a lot easier to use!)(This said, minus the DLC's mentioned in the game; DLC, hell you can charge 100 bucks for it)I'm not good with words, or organization, so this may not make much sense at all. Its a good game for people who like the retro indie ""sneak-em games"" as I call them... anyway...The main thing that stands this game out from the others is the fluid-like line-of-sight, the very ANGLE you stand in a corner can determine whether a guard can see you or not.By the way, about the guards.... what exactly are they attacking you with? I see a flashlight in one hand and what looks like a spanner or a lego hand in/as the other...			",58,7,0,2,4,1,1

												Monaco is one of my favorite games, and probably will remain so. From my perspective, its meant to be played co-op and not too seriously. Because it doesn't take itself too seriously. You and three of your friends (or three strangers on the internet) get to run, hide, steal, and generally cavort your way through tons of zany levels. And due to the amazing level editor, the content does not stop when you finish the story mode. Its tons of fun, so go buy it! You won't be disappointed. This game knows that even without the most advanced graphics, perks, or features, its all about gameplay, and Monaco's gameplay cannot be beat.			",78,8,1,9,17,1,10

												To call Monaco a stealth game would be like calling a dandelion food. While technically it is, if you are eating a flower you are probably doing it wrong. In the same way, Monaco is more of a cooperitive game then a stealth game. That isn't to say that it's a bad stealth game, in fact it's one of the best that I've ever played. It just that it's so much better with friends. The best parts of the game are when one player saves the rest of the party and completely turn the hiest around. Even playing online is better than playing solo. So if you are looking to spend a weekend with friends, this is the game to play.			",134,37,0,12,17,2,26

												Immediately upon launching the game from Steam gives an error message stating to ""restart Monaco via Steam to play online, etc.""  It doesn't tell you that you must turn on Steam Cloud.  This game will not work online, give achievements, or tie into Steam unless Steam Cloud is activated.  Users are forced to use Steam Cloud just so one single game can work the way its supposed to, which is completely broken from a programming standpoint.  If you're too lazy to code a working game / API that works as advertised then you get a thumbs down.  I haven't even played the game yet.  I've wasted 45 minutes trying to sort this out.

												Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is a 2D game where form a group of four along each character's stories. Playing alone is not recommended, additionaly, there are only a few lobbies to join in(or at least in my region) compared to when it had a ''free day''. It became boring to me after a day because of the lack of lobbies.Each session has its thrills and a whole lot of vibrant colours, even in screenshots. If you don't find it cheerful, your vision is my concern. As for the audio, I can't really say much; I was too busy collecting coins for my shotgun. As for the missions, I am glad they are assorted. They're not all prison breaks or heists, but I haven't finished the game so I can't really say more than that. I have played it long enough(I think) to say it though.The game doesn't have an atmosphere as it does not need any(though it would be more impressive if there was) because it is a fast-paced multiplayer, however, every random lobby has a random story; all three of you are in the stairs to the next leve-- wait, three? THREE? Well, you just found out one of your teammates got shot and now you have to get to him before advancing. One of you decides to do it, only to die in the process too(noob lol), you go ahead and get rushed by three guards, and the last one? Cowering in the ladder. After a minute of trying to convince the last guy, he eventually gets out of his spot and saves all three of you.But now your score is extremely low, which sucks. True story(Told it in Second-Person View so it wouldn't be that confusing with words).And so it comes to the generalization:Gameplay: 19/25Graphics: 15/25Concept: 17/25Presentation: 15/2566/100-----------------------------------------I think you'll like it for the first five days(in raw hours), so yes, I recommend Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine to you, the reader of this review. And please do give feedback so I could make my reviews more readable and helpful--JustOak ",20,2,0,0,3,0,0

												Hailll yisss, Monaco is my jam. Make sure you have a friend or two to play with! I had fun playing with strangers online, but the fun is amped up when you have a true partner in crime. You'll sneak your way through buildings, pulling heists, grabbing cash, causing distractions and making a clean getaway.It's one of those games where each level can be completed in a variety of manners and it's fun enough that you actually want to try each solution. Five bags of popcorn.			",371,104,4,27,21,1,22

												When I first got Monaco , I found it boring. I'm not an experienced gamer , and didn't know much about Monaco itself . I struggled a bit and didn't know how to go online .However , after about half a year of not playing it , I decided to give it another go . I loved it . I was hit with an exciting stealth game , which was cunningly designed . I adore the look of the game and its great how each character has its own little personality. But I have to say online mode is the best . Its not about stealth - its about set all the alarms of and run . I must've spent hours online playing with people all around the world , howling with laughter one minute , then reviving a player the next minute. The whole design of the game mixed with the beautiful music makes it a really good game to play alone , or multiplayer . Apart from the occasional crash ( after returning to desktop a few times it fixes it ) ,and not being able to make my own levels ( for some reason this just didn't work ) the whole game ran smoothly for me . I definately reccomend this game to anyone !			",6,2,0,0,3,0,1

												Monoco is a simple, class-based, top-down stealth game. It's a lot of fun, but also very difficult. It's a shame that it couldn't hold my attension for a very long time. It's by no means a bad game, it is in fact, a very well-designed and programmed game. I guess I just couldn't get into it. If you like stealth games, you will LOVE this game. If you like Ocean's Eleven, you will probably LOVE this game. I think it is very good and I will recommend it, I just don't know if I like it as much as I thought I would.			",23,2,0,1,0,0,0

												An absolute blast of a game, especially if your playing with friends. Its quick, fun and can get incredibly intense when there is four of you!Just to see what I mean, check this video out:

												By far one of the greatest local and online co-op games I know.This game can be played either solo or multiplayer, via lan or online. Although beware of local co-op. You will share the same screen, and depending on the strength of your computer and pupils of your eyes, the map expands and becomes smaller on the screen. This may be irritating for some, therefore I highly suggest playing co-op via online or lan.The game utilizes lots of timing and patience, yet feels very puzzle-like with a rush of adrenaline. The most charming appeal I found was how the layout of the levels you play are like blueprints of the venue you are robbing. You get to play through a series of characters with their individual special techniques. I suggest mastering all characters, and if you're new, start with Gentlemen and learn how to sneak. There are multiple possibliities of completing missions and you'll most likely never complete a mission like previous trials. When you play multiplayer, the game becomes more entertaining as new challenges with the actions of other players. You can either work in concert as a team, or watching the hilarity of chaos ensue as your teammates flee to save themselves from trouble. Regardless of your teams ability to play well, if you've mastered this game and understand its timing, you won't be frustrated with your teamates or the layout of the map, and you will want to find more competitive players/theives.Once you've gotten used to the game mechanics and obstacles, solo and co-op speed running becomes the new, neverending challenge. Beating these maps at the fastest speed becomes the ultimate reward.This game isn't for everyone, but it's certainly a new and innovative way of playing co-op.10/10			",138,15,2,2,11,0,6

												The game is a very enjoyable stealth/action game for PC. It has co-op for up to 4 players and barely lags(on my internet, that is). If you're into games like Splinter Cell and/or Metal Gear Solid, this game might be enjoyable for you. I'm still debating rather the game is worth the money though. It seems a bit steep for an indie game like this. Buy this game.			",113,3,3,6,3,1,5

												Ah, this game. And I'm not meaning that in a bad way. You may look at it and go ""i aM cOmpLt g4M3r nd deez gWafFix sux"". If that is the case, you are not a gamer. You are a moron. If you can look over a game's graphics and go ""hose gameplay mechanics equal a jolly, good time"" then welcome to Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine! Yes, the graphics are pixelated, but that just makes it more stylish, cartoony and unique. The stealth in the game is great and the characters all have perks that can help with the stealth. You can arm yourself with shotguns, crossbows and smokebombs, and get ready to steal some swanky stuff. Have I sold you yet? No? Just watch the trailer and listen to the Gentleman's smooth voice. That'll sell you.			",71,3,0,2,3,0,2

												Monaco is chaos, beautiful and organised chaos. I originally played it co-op with a friend and we had a great time trying to pick the perfect combination of characters to crack the missions. We thought with four of us it would be even easier, we were wrong. While four players gave us a wealth of skill it turned the whole thing into hilariously crazy and usually fatal attempts at the missions.			",36,2,0,2,4,0,1

												Monaco is probably one of the best co-op experiences to be found on Steam. It is very easy to pick up, yet difficult to master all of it's fine nuances. The difficulty curve is well balanced (though some complain that it becomes too hard near the end, I personally disagree) and has plenty of content.When Monaco was launched, it only came with the main campaign. Now there are an additional two campaigns, (one retelling the events of the game in a new perspective, and one telling the backstory of each of the main characters) a Zombie mode for all missions and a higly robust level creator. There is a final campaign coming as well.The pixelated, minimalist graphics style is bursting with tiny visual effects and charm. Your mind tends to fill in the gaps where the graphics don't give detail, further adding to the charm of hiding in bushes to evade guards.The sound is also fantastic. The music contributes to the atmosphere and the sound effects are meanigful as well.The co-op play is best experienced with friends in the same room. After a brief time of figuring out the game, players will be trying different strategies and utilizing each of hteir abilities to clear the levels. Having each player be a different character helps to have each player feel like they are making a meaningful contribution to the team. However, with more players, the chances of one player being spotted increaces, which makes for some of the best moments. One player being chased leads to another, and another. If you're looking for a great co-op experience, Monaco is highly recommendable.			",104,8,3,3,3,1,13

												This is my favorite game i've found on steam so far. Basically it is a stealth game, with great co-op and pvp multiplayer, where you basically conduct heists. The single player is also fun, but if you buy this game it is for the multiplayer. There are eight playable characters (four of which you unlock)  all with varying skills and abilities. And on top of all of that it has a great story, told by different points of view, but it is easy to understand without even reading the dialogue. Get it so we can play! 8/10			",64,10,2,17,10,0,3

												Monaco is a whismical, colorfully violent game.  It boasts an intriguing story, one-of-a-kind art direction and soundtrack, and the kind of cooperative gameplay and mechanics we haven't seen since Gauntlet: Dark Legacy.  It improves on that formula in almost every aspect, bringing true cooperation to the modern era outside of Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2.  Every character has their own distincy personality, color and playstyle, and it's super fun to figure out which one would be best for each encounter.  A single round can turn from meticulous planning to outright chaos in seconds, and no matter how you play, it's just a blast.    And what's even cooler, is that the community is the most civil I've ever seen.  Perhaps it's the lack of a competitive element, or how it's impossible to do well solo, but people just love this game, and are super cool about who plays as who.  TL;DR:  BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.

												This is a fun game that can be played in co-op with up to 4 players. It starts easy and gets progressively more challenging. There are tons of extra maps for it in Steam Workshop so even if there is replayability in the main campaign, you are not limited to that option once you completed the game.I would reccommend it especially if you get a few friends to commit to buy it and play it together.

												Overall it's a pretty fun game especially with friends. The PvP is a lot of fun and so are the missions but much better with friends because sometimes you'll get a person who has no idea what they're doing and just ruin everything. The main problem I have is being able to aim. I also feel that screen is a bit too clutered at times too. If it's on sale definetly buy it.			",58,1,0,5,3,0,4

												Very smooth visuals with a straight foward goal in each level. The finer mechanics of the game require a bit of playing around with, but the game has great presentation with what it is all about. The extra characters give replayability and adds almost an rpg feel to an action heist game that is even more fun with friends.			",36,7,0,9,1,0,5

												Worth your time, especially with friends. You can either play very stealthily and complete each level without ever being seen, or as a slap-stick heist where everything goes wrong.			",233,39,2,31,16,1,33

												Play with your friends and work together. Every character has their own task and should complete their task if you want to win. If you do something wrong its not game over luckily but it will be difficult fixing. Not to simple but not to hard. Up to 4 player co-op with different modes to choose from great game.

												Monaco: The city of opportunity, and the game like no other.  Every class feels important, and every situation I was in I could solve with every character in one way or another.  In co-op this game shines like you wouldn't believe.  I have no regrets picking this game up, or recommending it.			",95,7,0,11,3,2,7

												Let me give it to you straight, Monaco is a fantastic and lovingly crafted game.  At its most basic, it's pac-man meets Hitman.  That said, it's not for everyone.  It throws out the old way of viewing stealth in favor of a more tense, skin of your teeth heist feel.  Getting caught is no longer time to restart the checkpoint, but merely a situation that you must, and can, deal with.  Getting caught is fun, and the emergent situations you find yourself in are a joy to work your way through.  Perfectionists may get a little angry, as ""perfecting"" a level may require use of getting caught to make quick navigation easier.Where the game shines though, is the glorious Co-Op.  You approach the structure previously chosen to raid.  You plan meticulously.  Everything is going smoothly, but one person screws one thing up.  Insanity and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of fun ensues.If anyone picks this up I'm always game for some Co-Op.  In fact that's the main reason I bothered to write this.------------------------------------------------------TLDR-----------------------------------------------------Stealth game with a dose of uncontrolled insanitySuper fun Co-Op			",352,58,3,28,23,4,37
