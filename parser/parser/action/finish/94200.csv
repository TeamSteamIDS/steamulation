												Probably in my overall top 5 games of all time. This game is very easy to get into but extremly hard to master. Alot of fun playing local coop as well.			",520,48,24,27,36,8,89

												Pretty damn awesome old school shooter that gives any of the top japaense bullet hells game more than a run for their money. If you like the genre you need to play this. Also top notch presentation, artwork and music.A really well designed game that accomplishes what it sets out to do with aplomb.			",2198,857,88,271,225,28,362

												Jamestown has one of the very best soundtracks in an indie game (and I play a lot of indie games). It would fit in a huge budget movie brilliantly, gives the game a sense of urgency and scope even though it's just a vertical shooter. Listen to it: http://finalformgames.bandcamp.com/album/jamestown-soundtrackThen there's graphics. I'm a sucker for good pixel art and Jamestown really delivers in that department. The theme is pretty insane (American colonial wars on Mars) but again, this was a given for games made 20 years ago. I'm really happy there are still devs who writing that kind of silly but fun story nowadays.Game mechanics are both simple and skill-rewarding. You get a Vaunt meter that fills up when you collect gold from destroyed enemies, and when it's full you can activate the special. You'll get a shield for few seconds and your weapon will turn a different color and do more damage. If you want to sustain this you'll have to keep getting more gold. Larger enemies drop bigger amounts but you can also do combos on some enemies - destroying parts of them in a specific order or hitting them in a particular moment. This adds so much depth to the gameplay.There are only five levels in the whole game but each one is meticulously drawn and designed. The devs managed to convert this limitation in their favor. There are six difficulties to choose from and each new level cuts out the easiest one - that way you'll have to play the last level on one of the two hardest difficulties - Divine and Judgement. And believe me - this will test you. It's not as brutal as Japanese shmups but it gets intense. There are also 4 ships to choose from with different weapons and specials (the Gunner being my favorite). The DLC adds 4 more ships. Small number of levels didn't stop the devs from making a big number of shorter, bonus ones. You unlock these with coins you earn after your level evaluation. There's also a gauntlet mode where you play levels in order. Tough as nails but really satisfying.There's local co-op and it's done brilliantly. You can fully customize the controls and play 4-person co-op with one gamepad, a mouse and a keyboard. There's even an achievement for completing a level that way. No online though, not a problem for me but some people can see it as a serious flaw.I simply love this game. Wish more people would play it. It really reminds me of my Amiga days.

												Jamestown might be the most refined game I've played in the last decade. A top down bullet hell shooter set in an alternate history timeline (largely mirroring early American history, only this time with aliens), it presents itself with an air of confidence, as if it realizes what a pedigree its of and is determined to make you see so as well.You can try to break down what makes Jamestown so great into understandable pieces of a larger whole, but it's the combination of them all that pushes it beyond a decent reimagining of classic shmups, into a modern classic. The feel of the ships is relentlessly precise, the action ferocious and incredibly satisfying, and the presentation presenting a remarkably well realized world (despite how little exposition there is). The more you play Jamestown, the more these elements shine, upping the ante at a breakneck pace, forcing you to improve or perish. However, it does so in a way that allows for a natural increase in skill, letting players ease into the challenge instead of pushing them into it right from the start like the games of the genre are so known for. It also creates a continuous stream of rewards for players that manage to improve past the point of entry, with more elaborate enemy designs, tougher boss fights, and some truly grueling challenge levels. And then you have the coop, the glorious coop, the only flaw of which is that it is sadly local only. Should you get a chance to play with some friends though, it's a fantastic experience that scales perfectly and adds even more replay value as you go through levels that now feel new once again.At times the action is so intense that it's hard to even keep track of your ship, let alone take in all that Jamestown has to offer, but when you can manage to take a step back it's incredible the level of polish applied to even the smallest areas of the game. I was quite frankly taken aback when I first gave it a try, and this feeling was renewed even up to the very last boss fight, which was as epic and satisfying as I could have hoped for. If you have even the most remote fondness for bullet hell games, Jamestown is about as penultimate an entry point into the genre as you could hope for. Everyone with more than a passing enjoyment of the genre should have played it long ago, but if not, consider this a wake up call that you've been sleeping on something awesome.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Jamestown seems intent to bring back that closeness that comes with old-school arcade games. Supporting up to 4 player local co-op with any combination of mouse, keyboard, and contollers, Jamestown stands out from the crowd.On top of the multiplayer focus, Jamestown has a unique setting and great design. The story takes place in an alternate history of the colony of Jamestown on Mars, and that's about all there is to say. The art is great, nothing too special, but the music is fantastic. The epic soundtrack fits the intensity that the game reaches at certain difficulty levels. The pacing and progression hold Jamestown together nicely. The in game store allows you to buy new difficulty mode and bonus levels that both offer up some intense challenge. The game slowly makes you incrase the difficulty to reach new levels, which pushes you to practice and push yourself. There is also a joke mode that takes the already outlandish story and makes it even sillier.High scores are the main incentive for replaying. The game offers up a combination of any 4 ships that have their own unique play style, and the combinations  can get pretty insane on-screen. Vaunt mode can be activated after collecting a certain amount of gold and it releases giant shield that can aborsb bullets that will raise your score and save your friends. On top of this, enemies will also offer up bonus points if you hit them at a certain point or time ( I have barely figured out any of these). There are also many difficulty settings that can turn this game into a frantic bullet hell. This game is highly recommended with some friends. Even though the local co-op only may be a turn off, this will be a great excuse to see some of your friends in person. ***The DLC offers up 3 great new ships and pilots (Guy Fawkes included), and each of them are different and fantastic.

												Jamestown: Legend of the Lost Colony is a fun, one to four player simultaneous, vertically scrolling bullet hail shoot'em up that brings a modern take to an old genre. It twists the familiar space shooter into a new frontier classic. You don't pilot a spaceship, instead you're in what looks like a futuristic flight chair. Don't get deceived, this chair packs a punch, its got standard lasers, a special beam and shields. Thankfully, you can hold the button down for a stream of lasers. This is a game of fun, challenge and points, not wearing you out.The game has more than beautiful visuals, its got gorgeous gameplay mechanics that get explained in the tutorial. You collect gold nuts to fill up a shield meter, then when its full, you can use the shield to briefly block bullets. When that shield goes away, your red projectiles turn purple and you now have 50% higher damage and you get double your score. Aggression gets rewarded, because your meter starts to drain pretty quick unless you get more ""gold."" This gold also doubles as the in game currency.With this currency you can buy many things including three new ships, each with different weapons. Your starter chair's standard beam is a nice wide spread to make things easy and accessible, you'll feel powerful right off the bat. You also have a strong forward beam to rip through enemies. There's a subtlety to it though, you'll go slightly slower and I have no problem with that.From there you can buy a more complex chair that has a fat wave of a forward beam, but instead of having a more powerful weapon, holding the button lets you rotate the angle of the beam. So you can have the beam shoot in 360 degrees all while still having a meager front gun. The third ship has a double front laser, but it has a giant sphere that charges between your power shots. When you launch the projectile it moves slow, but in a way that's good, because that delay gives me time to get away while still avoiding projectiles. The fourth chair is a stream of a single laser, but your power attack detonates every beam. I give them credit for such creativity, but I couldn't find much of a use for it. Its designed to shoot next to the enemy, then detonate it so you get the most damage.Jamestown an accessible game, because the first three levels let you get your feet wet with a normal (easiest) difficulty. Its no pushover though, because to get to the fourth level, you'll need to complete the first three on difficult. Then to get into the fifth, you'll need to complete all four of the previous levels on legendary difficulty. No bullet hail shooter would be complete without two more difficulties above that. To some that may make it a grind having to replay levels, but I'd rather play the same levels twice on a harder difficulty than play the hardest difficulty right off the bat. That just scares people away.Since you're flying a chair, bullets only kill you when you the pilot get hit. Every death respawns you. Every continue brings up an arcade style countdown and when you run out of continues, you'll need to restart the level. This all makes the game forgiving, friendly and fun. It wants you to play it. It wants you to complete it and most of all it wants you to have fun. It rewards you with the gold you've collected in a level whether you complete it or die. You're always rewarded.After each level, you get dumped back to the game's menu. On this menu you can select any unlocked level, visit the game's shop or bonus challenge levels. I do feel it breaks up the action, but there's a gauntlet mode that lets you play the entire five level game start to finish with limited continues. At the start of the game, you're instantly given enough gold to purchase gauntlet mode. They know how unconventional a sort of hub menu is for a game like this, so they offer the traditional route.One thing that I didn't like on all menus was having a mouse pointer. Even using a 360 controller, you still have to use it as a mouse cursor. I suppose this was because there's so much going on the game's main menu with being able to select a locale on the world map to enter a level. While it was precise, I feel it was inefficient.The game is obviously a retro 90s style of gorgeous. I can tell the amount of love that got poured into this game with the detail in it. The levels are all completely different, and every enemy is too. You won't find the same enemies level to level, or even reskins. They're all different, with different habits. There's such a wide variety of enemies on a single level, let alone in all five. You've got agile ships, big ships, ground crawlers, wall turrets that shoot out horizontally and so much more. More importantly is these enemies are fun to destroy. They explode and it just feels good to laser through them. I think its one of the core elements needed to make a shoot'em up fun.The bosses are massive, almost screen filling with multiple patterns and parts. The parts are even marked on the meters at the top of the screen. You'll know this boss has three or five segments. They get more difficult with each stage. These bosses turn the game into a pattern based bullet hail. Windmills of bullets, different patterns, they all fill the screen, but the game is so pixel perfect you can dodge them without exact precision. Every boss is different, some you need to disable sections or pods. Others you'll need to damage their projectiles to even hurt them. When they open up to a moment of vulnerability, its on then. Just power blast your way into them and its just so satisfying to destroy a boss with screen filling explosions.Destroying a section of the boss or even big enemies destroy their projectiles. So there's a risk reward. Stay there with a bullet coming at you knowing you can blast off that segment or do you dodge? Its a good risk and reward there.The fifth level changes the mold of each level. There are moving walls that make things difficult. Luckily the walls don't hurt you unless they have spikes or they crush you. It was a nice touch that kept it interesting at the end.After each level, you're greeted with a breakdown of your score along with your rank. You also get to see the story to progress, and while I can say that the artwork is beautiful for the story, I didn't find myself reading any of it. It can be Shakespeare, but I just wanted to get back to the action. You can skip the story or even buy a lighthearted story from the shoppe.I can't forget the music though, its grandiose in a 90s era sort of way. Its another fantastic thing that stands up about the game. No offense to Jamestown, but it was from a game like Final Fantasy from the 90s, people would herald it as one of the best soundtracks. There's a variety of feels to each song, everything from a frontier wild west sort of fun song, to things that would sound at home in a Predator of Aliens game from the 90s.For those that like a challenge, there are five levels of difficulty and a hardcore mode without auto-respawn that you can buy from the store. There are more than a dozen challenging bonus maps. Everything from survive X amount seconds to score Y amount of points in X seconds. While I can survive the most crazy bullet bomb explosions, I'm not good enough to score big points. You've also got leader boards to keep you in game.If you're a bullet hail or shooter fan this is a must own. The 90s style and fun combat make it entertaining for multiple play throughs. Well worth $10 for the 2 hours.			",1125,324,51,104,96,15,167

												Jamestown is equally a shoot 'em up and bullet hell. Released a few years before this big trend of indie shumps, it's still the best choice for anyone interested in this genre, or for those who like to shoot stuff! Ridiculous plot, fitting graphics, super epic soundtrack compose an unforgettable experience. Oh, and I have yet to see more content in shoot em'up than Jamestown contains.Personally, Jamestown is not only my favorite shmup of all time, but it made me a huge fan of a genre I was never really fond of.So, I kindly ask everyone to grab a controller and play the hell of this!

												Jamestown is an extremely solid shmup, with one really fantastic advantage over other shmups.As a single player game, it doesn't match the classics it takes inspiration from. The bullet patterns and level designs are solid but also a bit bland and lacking in strategic variety. It's good, but not great.Where it really shines is multiplayer, as unlike the tacked on co op of your average Cave game, Jamestown's mechanics and gameplay were finely balanced around co op from the start. It's probably the best co op shmup ever made, and that's definitely something to brag about.It also has one of the best and most creative settings and aesthetics for a shmup outside of a Cave game. The theme, music, pixel art, and setting are excellent.If you don't have anyone to play with (local multiplayer only), than Jamestown is a decent shmup that should probably be somewhere in the middle of your wishlist compared to some of the other excellent PC shmups out there. However, if you have some friends to play with, it's an absolute must buy.			",313,29,1,25,3,2,22

												I love local co-op. And this is one of the best. Me and three of my friends, sprawled on the couch, shouting at each other -- ""I'm down! Someone grab a revive!"" ""WHOA, get to the left!"" ""VAUNT! VAUNT! VAUNT!"" It's an incredible blast.Other points, if you need 'em: the art is good, the soundtrack is FANTASTIC (we always sing along with the final boss level's super awesome music), the advancing difficulty mechanism is clever, and the vaunt gimmick is interestingly tactical without being complicated.I can't let it go without mentioning that they have GREAT controller support and keyboard/mouse support. I cannot fathom why other designers don't implement the level of wide support these guys have. My weird off-brand Chinese controller, my XBOX controller, my friend's no-name controller, and the keyboard all play nicely together in the same co-op game.I wish there were more like this!

												Another cool bullet-hell shooter (though nowhere near Crimzon Clover level) with a unique setting, a variety of ships (with more via DLC) and interesting progression (you have to beat the previous levels on higher difficulties to progress through the game) make this a shmup that purists should check out. Oh, and it's 4-player. Haven't seen a 4-player shooter since Blast Works on the Wii.			",666,79,28,52,37,0,71

												If you're looking to get yourself into these crazy looking shoot 'em ups (""shmups"") you've seen out there, like your Touhous, your DoDonPachis, your eXceeds, your Crimzon Clovers and what have you, but still feel too intimidated by being awash in a sea of pretty projectiles decimating your chances of survival, then Jamestown may just be the perfect place for you to get started. In comparison to all of the other shooters mentioned, Jamestown keeps things relatively simple, not only in its variety of bullet patterns, but the various underlying systems for scoring and survival are fairly easy to understand. With Jamestown you'll naturally learn various techniques that can transfer over to nearly any ""bullet hell"" kind of game, such as understanding your player character's tiny hitbox (if things hit this, you die!), grazing through tight openings in bullet patterns, and ""streaming"" various aimed attacks that come at you from one side of the screen to the other, with bullets narrowly missing you. Key to mastering the game is understanding the ""vaunt"" system. Vaunting requires only a full vaunt gauge to activate and a single button press. Vaunting affords you some momentary invincibility both upon activation and deactivation, but also serves to double the points you receive from destroying enemies and picking up collectibles as well as doubling the damage you do. It's an ingenius system that can be used for newbies as a way to nullify tricky to dodge patterns and for more advanced players to milk the scoring system for all its worth. In that way, you can almost literally play Jamestown any way you want, be it for survival or gunning for high score challenges. Though the game is relatively short (five stages total), there's still a really great amount of content to be explored. While playing, you'll unlock four types of ships, challenge maps that will further enhance your understanding of how shmups work, and a whole slew of difficulty modes that are all geared toward creating a smooth level of challenge as you keep moving up and getting better. So, even if the ""main game"" is a tad on the short side, the game's still feature rich enough to warrant the pricetag. Jamestown is not only a dandy little shmup itself, but it's also a very comprehensive learning tool that can help new players to the genre come to grips and get over the intimidation factor. The myriad of difficulty selections and stage designs all feel constructed around the idea of getting better as you play. The more you put into Jamestown, the more you'll get out of it. It may be a tad too tame for experienced shmup players, but new players definitely can not go wrong here.			",280,60,2,29,8,1,17

												Jamestown is a fast paced indie shmup that features tons to unlock and some pretty damn nice visuals.In Jamestown you'll be able to select from a number of different ships to play as, and each one play pretty different from one another. Some will have homing missiles, others will have plasma beams, and all sorts of other special abilities. As far as mechanics is concerned it's pretty simple. You have your regular shoot button, then a special which you can charge for an alternate fire, you also have vault as a defensive skill to negate any immediate dangers and bullets, and that's about it! Shoot stuff, collect the coins, then buy stuff with the coins. It's not a hard game to get into but it is a hard one to master.

			Jamestown: Impressions (shoot'm up, shmup, Indie Game, Gameplay, and Review) Relevant information and links below Jamestown is a shmup, or shoot'm up that features great pixel art, and an indie...		

The game's pacing is great as well. Each level never over stay it's welcome, while offering varied difficulty challenges as you proceed through them. This is a good thing since you'll be going over the same levels more than once in order to unlock everything in the game. It is arguable that Jamestown recycles a lot of the same content, but the developers have introduced interesting ways to reuse older assets to further the variety the game has to offer. From arcade mode, to challenge modes, and even a gauntlet mode, and more to unlock later on.The game's graphics and presentation is top-notch. The pixel art featured is of a high caliber, with great details and animation. The game's soundtrack compliments the game's excellent presentation and really hits home the atmosphere the game tries to get across. It's just a gorgeous looking and sounding game.There's a lot to love about Jamestown, but it's not perfect. The biggest issue I drew from the game is it's white enemy bullets. Of all the colors in the color wheel, why on earth did the developers choose white as the color of what's arguably the most important element in a shmup? White blends into the background, it blends in when there are explosions, it blends in where the screen shake. White is just not the color the eye picks up on first. When you're talking about shmups, visual clarity is of the utmost importance. Shmup players don't watch their spirits or the bullets individually, they ""feel"" them like a 6th scent. Usually in other shmups enemy bullets are as clear as day, allowing the player to ultaize their peripheral vision to ""feel"" their way around the battlefield. Because the bullets are white, a dull, uncaptivating color, the player is forced to watch every single bullet while keeping a close eye on the character sprite, forcing the player to play with a focus on parts of the game that shouldn't be focused on. The focus should be on the on coming dangers, not the immediate danger. The white bullets is my only real complaint about Jamestown, but it is a major one considering the genre.Overall Jamestown is an excellent shmup. It feels great, it has a great degree of variety, and the ships are very interestingly designed. It does suffer from visual clarity problems due to it's white enemy bullets, but if you can adjust, I have no doubt Jamestown will be a memorable experience. Pros:- Fantastic pixel art- Fantastic Soundtrack- Great diversity in ships- Lots to unlock- Many different ways to playCons:- White enemy bullets... for a shmup... seriously what the hell were the devs thinking?(Only one con, but this one is a biggie)Hours of Jamestown played: 2.5Completion Status on Jamestown: N/AThis copy of  Jamestown was purchased			",1483,526,23,180,133,13,163

												Jamestown is well known to many Americans as the first colonial settlement in North America in 1619. This game is also set in the year 1619, but it is not in the New World. It is set in Mars. You are a British colonial on the run from the king and country and you try to uncover the secrets of the colony of Roanoke. However, the opposing forces you must face are the Spanish/Martians. This is a top-down shooter that would remind shooters fans of top-down shooters from the 1980s.It feels like the plot takes a backseat to the solid gameplay. The game introduces you to the beam ship, a standard ship with a primary mode and a secondary mode that requires you to use the left mouse and right mouse, respectively. Other ships are locked until you complete some campaign missions, but you will still have to use the left and right mouse buttons. The controls are that simple, but the game will always test your skills to the max. The beam ship’s primary mode is the 2 lines of bullets and the secondary mode is the powerful beam that can destroy lesser enemies with ease and is very useful against larger enemies. Other ships that are unlocked have their own primary and secondary modes and are good for testing in the campaign missions and challenge stages. The DLCs have more ships that can be unlocked and are definitely worth trying out while testing your skills.All ships unlocked in the game have one thing in common: a vaunt meter. You must fill up this vaunt meter by collecting the golden nuts and bolts that defeated enemies drop. Once you activate that vaunt by using your default middle mouse button, there is a circular shield that appears around your ship. At first glance, the vaunt looks like it is useful for defensive strategies and is a life saver. I later realized that the vaunt begins a point multiplier that builds up as you defeat enemies while the vaunt is active.  You can defeat many enemies in a very short time, but the vaunt also lasts for a short time. The vaunt is best activated when you are in a tight situation, such as when many enemies are firing so many bullets it would be hard to get through them without being blown up.James town challenges your shooting and movement skills enough that you would have to visit your shoppe to buy some items with the currency you have earned during the campaign missions. The currency comes from collecting the golden nuts and bolts from the defeated enemies. You can buy new ships and challenge packs with your hard earned currency. The challenge stages are break from the campaign missions, but they truly put your skills to the test and train you for other challenge stages and campaign missions.The challenge stages require you to reach specific goals such as scoring X number of points in X number of seconds. In one challenge stage you must destroy train cars to score an extraordinary number of points to complete the stage. The trick is to destroy train cars, but destroying the engine car last is the key to scoring so many points. I think this is a smart learning curve put together by the indie developers of this game. The difficulties are not unfair because the game is not over that quickly. Jamestown gives you a few credits from the beginning of the mission or challenge stage and those credits can be enough to win at the end.An interesting take on the learning curve of Jamestown is how you unlock future campaign missions. In order to unlock future campaign mission you have to complete each of the other previous missions on the next highest difficulty level. Every campaign mission begins with ordinary enemies and some larger enemies. When you reach the last stage there is a boss to defeat. It is important to lose as few lives as possible in order to defeat the boss since it is easy to lose multiple credits. There are lots of close calls throughout the game and your ship explodes when it is hit in its dead center. The vaunt becomes critical in these close calls, but you have to be sure that the vaunt is available when the situation is right.Jamestown has local co-op of up to four players. It is surprising to me that there is no multiplayer since the game would have made for some interesting competition. There are leaderboards to show you how you stack up against other players from around the world.The graphics are pixelated, but the pixelation is very impressive and detailed. All the explosions and action look very nice and you clearly see the well detailed stripes on the uniforms of the enemies who represent the Spanish/Martian forces. Essentially, the graphics provide enough style and the gameplay of Jamestown provides enough substance to warrant buying this game at an affordable price of $9.99. The opportunities to unlock ships, campaign missions, and challenge stages will motivate you to continue playing so that you can hone your skills enough.My Score: 8/10 ",190,18,0,4,7,2,6

												Fast paced bullet hell shmup. Tons of fun if you're into that thing. Boasts plenty of difficulty levels, and alternate ships and abilities to use. Coop is a blast, if you can find people to play with you. The music is fun, the game is tight and responsive, and the mechanics and point systems are well thought out. If you're a fan of the genre and still haven't played it, I recommend it.Also the story is pretty hilarious.			",315,49,6,72,19,0,73

												It is 90s' vertical arcade shooter with enhanced features and presentation!Good:- Beautiful 2D pixel drawings, very rare to see in nowadays, about the top notch graphic level of previous NeoGeo games- Marvelous Soundtrack, match the story background neatly- Great control response and very accurate hit box detection- Pretty enemy designs- Various modes and challenge adds replayablility- Wide screen vertical shooters is eyes friendly- Local Coop up to 4 players, I don't complaint the lack of Online mode as I can see it won't goes well with current Internet environment for such tense response gameBad:- Scenario stages is quite short, I don't mind to buy DLC to extend the joySuggestion:- Vault Bulletshield is same for all Ships. If every Ships can varie with such as Slow-mo, Bullet reflection, Bullet Breakshot,  Bullet Blackhole or etc.Score: 85/100			",531,175,5,54,16,2,38

												I got this as part of Humble Bundle 4. I bought the bundle for Super Meat Boy and Cave Story+ (I'd never heard of this game at the time), but this is the game that was my favorite of the bunch. It's really fun, really tight, and a great recommendation for shmup fans. Most fun I've had with a shmup since Ikaruga, but it's not as hardcore as Ikaruga, and that's probably a good thing for most.			",74,21,1,3,6,1,10

												Jamestown is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up which supports up to four players locally. The game has four ships each with its own unique attack style. The levels are played asynchronously. In addition to the storyline there are a number of challenge modes which can be completed. In 1619 Raleigh has escaped execution at the hands of his own king. Desiring to clear his name Raleigh flees the Tower of London and heads to the new world, Mars. Mars is currently being fought over between the English and the Spanish armada. Unfortunately for Raleigh the Martians are loyal to the Spanish and have sided with them. Resting his hopes for clearing his name on solving the mystery of the vanished settlement at Roanoake, Raleigh heads to the Jamestown colony in search of John Smith.Jamestown is the first alternate history/sci-fi shooter I have ever played and indeed it may be the only one that exists. Storyline is not something I have payed mind to in other shoot'em ups, but it is very present in Jamestown. Before and after every level you get a story update. Happily these can be easily be skipped and even turned off entirely. I don't mind the story, but it's not why I'm playing a shoot'em up. Jamestown has everything you would expect in a shooter. Destructible enemies to kill, indestructible objects to avoid, bonus items to grab. But the details differentiate it. Before each stage you select a type of ship. At the beginning your options will be limited but as you play the other ships will unlock. You can plays with the Beam, Gunner, Charge or Bomber. Beam and Charge are both listed as standard while Gunner and Bomber are listed as advanced. And I certainly agree with the assessment. The two advanced ships are much more difficult to use effectively.Each ship has two attack modes. The Beam gives you a wide radius of fire and is the only ship to natively firing range outside of what is directly in front of you. The special weapon here is a high-powered constant beam which fires directly in front of you and rapidly damages opposing ships. The drawback is that your ship moves quite slowly while firing this special attack. The other standard ship is the Charge. The basic weapon is has a smaller firing dispersal and fires fewer bullets than the Beam's basic weapon. The Charge special shot fires a slow moving ball that damages any enemy in its path. It doesn't stop when it contacts an enemy, but rather continues on damaging anything in the path. It slowly charges over time, so that if you wait to use it the ball will be larger and more destructive. The first advanced ship you will unlock is the Gunner. This ship has a basic weapon very similar to the Charge ship and is unique in that the special weapon is always active. Using the special weapon allows you to change the direction in which the special weapon fires. Thus if you press left while using the special weapon it will fire left. When you let up on the special weapon the direction of fire will lock in place until you use it again. This weapon certainly takes some getting used to, but it is the only weapon that allows you to fire to the left, right or towards the rear of your ship. The Bomber has the weakest basic weapon, a single stream of bullets. But the using the special causes the bullets to explode doing tremendous damage. When you destroy an enemy, it explodes into a field of golden gears and cogs. Collecting these not only increases your score but also moves increases the Vaunt meter. Once activated Vaunt has several effects. For a short time it provides a shield around your ship. For a longer but still limited time you will double your score. Collecting gears and cogs during the Vaunt will increase the time your score increases. Vaunt also increases the damage your ships weaponry does to enemy units. The final feature of Vaunt mode is that if you press vaunt again while it is active  you will get a shorter lasting shield, but Vaunt mode immediately ends if you utilize this.Jamestown ostensibly has five difficulty levels ranging from Normal to Judgement. But make no mistake the first two: Normal and Difficult do not allow you to play the full game. If you play on Normal you can only access the first three levels of the game. You will then be forced to play the earlier levels on a higher difficulty to continue the main story mode. If you should choose to use the Difficult setting you can access the fourth but not the fifth level of the game. This was frustrating to me as a player. I recommend using Legendary (or higher) difficulty from the beginning.  Jamestown offers a number of additional gameplay options beyond the main story mode. There is the Gauntlet mode where you play through all the levels consecutively. You are given three lives per credit and three credits. The credits do not reset during gameplay. Gauntlet is unique in Jamestown in that it is the only mode where your accomplishments in one level have any bearing on the next.There are also a number of Bonus Levels that can be unlocked. These must be unlocked to access them through a mixture of spending ducats and doing well on the challenges which you already have access to. Most of the conditions for completing the bonus levels are earning certain number of points and activating rings by flying over them, in others you simply have to survive a set amount of time.Jamestown offers four player simultaneous play. However it is local only. The ships are clearly designed to work well together so that one player can ameliorate the weaknesses of the ship of another, or can activate a vaunt shield to protect a friend. It is unfortunate that online multiplayer was not offered. Jamestown also offers for additional purchase a DLC pack which has more ships to choose from and bonus levels.I really like the look of Jamestown which is a throwback to the 16 bit era with pixelization and attractive sprites. The soundtrack is also quite good. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like it, Jamestown never captured my interest as much as I was hoping. I think that is largely to do with the fact that the game appears to be primarily designed for multiplayer co-op. If I could play online multiplayer I have a feeling my appreciation for Jamestown would increase tremendously. The other aspect that detracts for me is that each level is its own unique challenge and that your performance in one does not carry over to the next. I tend to most enjoy shoot'em ups where you can continually upgrade your weapons until you can destroy most anything on the screen without trying too hard. And then I can get a bunch of free guys so that by the time the game is challenging enough that I die even with my tremendous fire power and start again with a basic ship I have enough lives that I can brute force my way to the finish. Can't do that in Jamestown. The only way to upgrade your destructive capability is with Vaunt and choosing a more destructive ship, and you can't get any free lives. My guess is that Jamestown is a lot more fun to play multiplayer. But I think it is unlikely that I will ever get a chance to try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game slowly turns you into a real man. You start like ""yeah, normal difficulty"" and then you realize that to finish the game you need to gradually increase the difficulty of every stage, making you play every freaking level on legendary difficulty and teaching you that the bullet hell is a real place where you will be sent there at the first sign of defiance.TL;DR great bullethell topdown shooter arcade thingy, a great challenge.

												I can only recommend this game if your going to playing with a few friends. I'm getting kind of depressed of the direction games are going today, focusing on multiplayer, I'm happy it's an option...but I feel that I'm getting punished for playing by myself. Also for the love of god why are all of the enemy projectiles G R E Y? Grey is such a nuetral color it really doesn't stand out from the environment. Other than that loads of fun, check it out guys.			",410,118,7,62,31,2,57

Product received for free
												Disclosure: I marked “received this product for free” because I received it as a gift.Jamestown: Legend Of The Lost Colony is a game that I wanted to play at one time.  Before I make a purchase I typically check out reviews (both good and bad) and the Steam Discussions to see if there is anything that might make me think twice about buying.  If the game crashes on start or has some sort of other technical issue there is a good chance someone will be posting about it.  In the case of Jamestown, one doesn't have to look far to find some dirt.When I looked through the discussions I learned that Final Form Games appear to have completely abandoned the PC version of the game (it looks like they stopped support to focus on PlayStation 4's Jamestown+). The developers haven't posted since June 24, 2015.  There is at least one somewhat major bug that they're aware of and haven't fixed as of today August 28, 2016.  For many users, every enemy projectile in the game is currently a dull grey color.  The color of bullets in shooting games is kind of a big deal and there is a good reason why they often are colored brightly.  How are you supposed to dodge them if you can't see them clearly?  I've played quite a few shoot 'em ups and this was enough to convince me not to buy the game.  A fix exists, but it doesn't work for all users.  It involves reverting to a previous version through the properties menu of the game in Steam.  It ended up partially working for me.  It fixed the colors but the game became unplayable unless played windowed.  I strongly prefer fullscreen so decided to keep the grey bullets.  Aside from not being aesthetically pleasing, there were only a few parts where I found them to be particularly detrimental.  I also experienced odd controller bugs if I was holding a direction immediately while spawning. I'm not sure if it was my gamepad or not, but it wasn't difficult to avoid once I realized what was causing it.Jamestown isn't really a standard arcade style shooting game.  Rather than being one continuous run, the game is split up into five stages.  In order to unlock all five stages the player is required to beat the earlier stages on progressively higher difficulty levels.  The later stages do not feature lower difficulty options at all.  This serves as a nice and slow introduction for individuals inexperienced with the genre.  In addition to the regular stages there are challenge levels that feature special objectives such as flying through rings, getting a certain score within a time limit, or surviving a brief onslaught.  The regular stages are enjoyable but I had even more fun with the challenges.  The only campaign stage I didn't like was the final one which unexpectedly introduces environmental hazards which aren't in the earlier levels and felt out of place.After completing a stage you are rewarded with ducats that can be used in the store.  Among other things the store sells alternate ships, additional challenges, and the gauntlet mode.  Each ship has a primary attack, a special secondary attack, and the ability to vaunt.  Activating vaunt mode provides temporary invincibility, a damage bonus, and a score multiplier.  Picking up coins prolongs the amount of time your retain the bonuses.  The Gauntlet serves as the game's version of an arcade mode where you play through all the stages consecutively with limited continues.  It is also worth mentioning that the game allows up to four players. I never tested multiplayer out myself so I can't say how well it works.Although it's a little unorthodox when compared to classic Japanese arcade shooters, Jamestown is one of the strongest entries into the shoot 'em up genre from a western developer that I've ever played.  It's truly sad that Final Form Games has let it fall into its current state.  The game is gorgeous, the soundtrack is great, and the overall presentation is outstanding.  Due to the solid package and enjoyable gameplay I'd recommend this game, but with a warning about the likelihood of encountering bugs. There is a lot of fun to be had here and it's playable even with the grey bullets, but I think it's important that potential buyers know that there are bugs that may never be fixed. Like the review?

												It's 1619 and escaping execution by your king you head to The New World, Mars! There you get involved with Captain John Smith, Virginia Dare, Martians and the search for the lost colony of Roanoke. But this is really a retro style bullet hell shoot'em up. You destroy swarms of alien ships while dancing between the bullets. You can unlock different ships with different types of weapons, Challenge Levels and other game modes. There are five levels to the game, But to unlock the later levels you have to complete the previous ones at higher difficulty settings. You get nine lives for each level, So the game is pretty forgiving in that sense.On my play through I started at the easiest difficulty setting and had to replay the earlier levels at higher settings. I really didn't mind since it only took me a couple of hours to get to the last level. But the last level took me just as long, If not a little longer, to beat than the rest of the game. I only completed one of the challenge levels and only dabbled a little with gauntlet mode.I never been big on bullet hell games, but this game is OK. The game looks good and plays good. But there is just too much selecting stuff from menus. It gives the game a disjointed feel rather than a journey. Integrating that stuff into the game would have helped maintain continuity between the levels and taken the player out of the game less often. Basic gameplay is fine.  Though, Maybe I'm just relatively inexperienced in the genre, At times things seemed more like a matter of luck than skill. Having 3 lives and 3 continues (another thing to pull the player out) per level definitely helped me get through the game. This is an Indie game so the music is, as expected, excellent. Not really a big part of the game is the whole colonial Mars story. Which is fine as it's just something to connect the levels and not very interesting otherwise. In a way this seems more like a taster than a complete game. Aficionados may enjoy it and it is friendly to beginners. But the overall experience could have been better.Edit - A marginal thumbs up.

												Jamestown is a bullet hell shooter, so that pretty much guaranteed that I would like it. It’s got a very unique setting; it’s set in the 16th century, on Mars! The main character is fleeing from the King of England, and is fighting against the Spanish fleet and a bunch of aliens, with steampunk jetpacks things. That’s kind of cool.Gameplay-wise the most notable thing is that it’s a widescreen, but scrolls vertically. I’m not used to that, as it means a lot of bullets come from the sides, as opposed to games like Touhou and Dodonpachi, but it's nice that the majority of the screen isn't wasted. There’s also a pretty big variety of ships, with very different play styles. But I still stick to the Dodonpachi-style ship, cause that’s what I’m good with.The pixel art is nice, the music is fitting, and the game difficulty is quite reasonable.			",214,53,1,19,12,0,5

												Really enjoyable bullethell shooter, Jamestown is a good choice for some couch co-op fun. The controls work about equally well with mouse, keyboard or a gamepad and there are several difficulty levels, although like most bullethell games it leans towards being hard. The graphics are well made with detailed backgrounds, the soundtrack is excellent and there are several mini challenges as well as a funny dialogue option which give variety to the core game. Its weaknesses would be its small level variety as well as the lack of online co-op. I do recommend nevertheless, especially for local co-op purposes, where you will get the most out of it.

												A cool shmup with easy entering, and a good bunch of higher difficulty settings. Allows you to control 4 different ships, finish 5 campaign levels, and try something over 20 short challenges. It's stylistic and very polished in almost every aspect. That said, unless you want to beat some high scores, it's incredibly short. If I didn't try easier difficulties first, I wouldn't need to replay levels on higher ones to unlock the rest of the story. And once I got a hang of it- I completed it in something like half an hour on 3rd difficulty (of 5+no respawn mode).It's worth noting that I don't play shmups at all, and I always thought that I'm absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥at them, yet I never lost a level on the 3rd difficulty in this game. I guess that means its entry point is really casual friendly.			",305,45,2,32,17,2,16

When you get 4 people going on this it can really get fun and challenging. Try and dodge everthing while shooting may sound boring to you but try if for yourself and you'll see how fun it really is.Single player is still really enjoyable (not as much fun as with friends though)			",63,5,2,4,12,0,23

												Jamestown is a shoot'em up (shmup) that pleased me greatly. The game's story is set in a fictitious alternative past in the XVII century, where the planet Mars is a British colony that is at war with Spanish forces allied with the native Martians. Some real historical characters of the period even are mentioned in the game as the famous John Smith. Jamestown has a very good vertical gameplay, being that the game has four types of ships, each ship has a normal shot and another special. There is also the ""Vaunt Mode"" that can be activated when the gold bar is full. The ""Vaunt Mode"" when activated generates a temporary shield around the ship and also allows double the damage and also the points earned while active. The 2D graphics of this game are well done and the controls work well, but the highest point of the game is the soundtrack ... it's superb! Especially the tracks of Chapters 1, 3 and 5 that are simply wonderful! Jamestown: The Legend of Lost Colony captivated me and was quite enjoyable for me to finish it. Too see me playing Jamestown's, please check the videos below:

												This is a great bullet hell style overhead shooter with viberant hand drawn graphics and a stunning sountrack and oddly enough a good orginal story, which is rare for a shoot 'em up. Now it is a bit on the short side with only 6 stages total(hopefully they will add more in future DLC) but given that you have to finish previous stages on certain difficulty levels in order to play the last two it does extend the game a bit, plus there's tons of challange maps to helpkeep you busy and did I mention this is a blast in multiplayer? No.. well it is.			",303,72,2,55,14,3,46

												This is allround, great bullet-hell game. You could make an argument, that it does not have that many levels and if played on lower difficulties it can be blasted through in 30 minutes or so. However, in its essence, Jamestown is like old arcade shooters, they were never long but their difficulty and the fact that they created a strong competetive scene, were the highlights of this kind of games. On top of scalable difficulty, game offers additional challenges in form of short survival modes, boss battles, going through campagins in gauntlet mode etc. Hard to get bored. Last but not least, the esthetics of the game is really interesting, it blends nicely, this old school feeling and still it manages to look modern enough and not too pixelated (see screenshots/video on the store front).I am sure that there are games waaaay hardcore in ths genre than Jamestown, but with this one I found myself playing over and over just to get slightly better score and advance through leaderboards.Give it a shot.

												Accessible at first, but quickly escalates into some tremendous challenges. Makes great support of local coop for up to four players, if you have the devices for such. It also has a strong sense of accomplishment, presenting what looks like an impossible challenge but making all the threats very clear and obvious. Despite its status as a bullet hell shooter, the visual design is very clean and smooth, keeping things from getting too washed out and unclear. Only on the rare occasion do you feel like you were hit by something you couldn't possibly have seen, instead usually feeling like you screwed up and can do better. It's one of the best local coop games on Steam currently, both nostalgic while new, smooth, and slick. Definitely worth giving a go if you have a few someones hanging around you can strap down for long enough.			",374,111,9,41,22,4,35

Great graphics, very well balanced enemy placement, good music, and a combo/scoring mechanic which balances risk/reward very nicely. If you're an advanced SHMUP player you might find this a tad on the easy side, but for everyone else it's a great entry point into the genre.

												I really enjoyed this game, and after seeing the teaser for it about 2 years ago, I knew I 'd like it...Here I am today after buying it and I know that I was not wrong at all.  The flow of the game is fast, challenging  and very pleasing to the eye and ear.  It is also , like many retro games, a designed as a 4 player co-op. Overall , This is a very well put game .There is nothing hard to understand about Jamestown, it is also pretty easy to play(although I am refering to picking it up and getting used to it, not difficulty)I have 2 small qualms with Jamestown.  Although the Devs probably wanted you to work hard to complete it ( and my god, I certainly did )  it seems silly that the last  levels are locked, where you have to play levels 1-3 on Legendary difficulty first, which is pretty hard, I guess in most other games I would expect to play the game beginning to end on hard or normal difficulty, not grind away on the harder difficulties before I get that option.  And well the end level is pretty friggin hard too, I spent 4 hpours trying to beat it as it has an intense and really hard to keep track of enviroment which is very celverly laid out, as  well as the boss..,.   In saying that I do kind of get a kick out of getting something for my sweat, so the design option may not be so bad...  The next thing is that though this is a retro style top scrolling shooter, on the last level inparticular, I was experiencing some slow down... True enough, there was ALOT happening all at once, however, for such a 'simple ' game, I would expect it to run well on my Dual core which runs most other games farily well.I did find the very bar bones application of the story quite puzzling, it was good though, particualrly since the whole lay out of the game kind of pushes it.  Also this style is very intesteing too, a sort of steampunk/New world (or what ever it is...,)  style pretty cool.After completting it today, I have bought the Dlc, and would consider it well worth it, its good fun and if you are like me and like challenges, then try completeing it...

												Jamestown blends the Civil War with Sci-fi madness in a side-scrolling shooty awesome game. I don't know the exact name for these types of games, but you do, so I wont go into it, but it's one of those. And, I loved it.The story is twisted and unique, setting a weird alien invasion alongside the Civil War, pitting you against enemies the likes of which have never been seen.The controls are very nice and controller compatible, which is what I played it on, so I can't attest for keyboard controls. The game is a satisfying length for an indie game, take you a few hours to beat, with some *extremely* hard, to the point of impossible achievements. Definitely pick it up if you like these sorts of games, the story is interesting the gameplay is really fun.-Nilesy			",312,139,3,47,47,5,46

												One of the best shmups on Steam. It has 5 difficulty options and 5 stages. The stages are designed nicely and the bosses are also. Everything looks great and the stages have a lot of details put into them. The game has a shop system where you can buy ships and challenge levels. The 4 ships you can pick from are all unique. No 2 ships play similar to each other. The challenge stages will also last you a long time. They are difficult objectives to complete in a short section of a stage and there are around 20 of them. You also can't beat the game on Normal difficulty. You need to raise it higher to play the last 2 stages. Leaderboards are included, so you can challenge your friends to the highest scores in the game. The only thing I don't like about the game, is that there are no upgrades. I always enjoyed upgrading my firepower while playing a shmup, but there is none of that in this game. Jamestown can be completed in around 30 minutes like most shmups, but it has the depth to be played for a lot longer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me start off by saying that i've not played any ""bullet hell"" games before. Jamestown was my introduction to the genre, and what a great introduction it was. Although i've yet to plow through it with a buddy on Judgement difficulty, it's great fun to play with and without a partner. The aim is to survive every level by dodging all of the projectiles that the enemy fires towards you and to simply survive 'til the end, where there'll be a boss awaiting for you to defeat. There's a good variety of ships to use that all have different tactics and methods of progressing the stages and they're all entertaining to use. The DLC is well worth it, too. So don't hesitate to pick it up - it'll give you some brand new ships to add to your arsenal. A great game, well worth your time.All in all, i'm giving it an 8/10.			",615,138,20,106,59,9,98

												Beat the main story in about 4 hours with my wife. Very fun. Great, intense soundtrack, sound, graphics, and gameplay. Overall, a satisfying and engaging experience. Does a great job of providing multiple difficulty levels and giving you a good learning curve. The way local multiplayer works makes it fun because you can revive each other. Even though me and my wife had to try the final stage over like 30 times, we never really felt frustrated because the game isn't too punishing and the fact that you're playing together definitely just makes things more enjoyable. I highly recommend this unless you don't like this kind of game, and it plays great if you have an arcade stick/fightstick and maps really easily. Plenty of replayability too if you want to compete on the leaderboards or try more challenging game modes (like hardcore mode where you don't revive over time or Gauntlet mode where you play through all stages in one go).

												Lush.  The most beautiful SNES game released in 2011, Jamestown also plays like a dream.  This is a strong vertically scrolling bullet-hell shooter with a lot of variety thanks to its multiple ship types, several difficulty levels, and challenge mode.  A solid score system will have you balancing strategies for combo extension against the preservation of your own life.  Art, music, and story come together perfectly to create a lavish production in a wildly original setting; when you break through the waves of the Spanish-Martian armada to a rousing crescendo of the score and discover the fate of the lost colony of Roanoke as the mists clear beneath your Conveyance, you understand all at once how special Jamestown really is.

												Edit: I decided to re-write part of my review, because I think it's a crying shame more people haven't played this.I've played a lot of arcade shooters, both old ones and ones made within the last year (or five), and I have to say that Jamestown is probably the most aesthetically pleasing shooter I've played in decades, and easily the best western-made shooter by far. The excellent input customization is really crazy compared to other games coming out lately. The game just works right out of the box, period, no matter what input you have or what problems you're used to.The music is beyond excellent and the graphics are superb, the entire game has a nostalgic quality that comes from successful emulation of older japanese-made arcade shooters from the 80's and 90's. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone, you merely need to enjoy old-school shooters to get the full effect of and appreciation for the game itself.  It's quite forgiving at low difficulty, and higher difficulties stay challenging even after a few playthroughs. The highest difficulty levels are pretty rough for me, and I have a penchant for the whole bullet-hell genre. My only 'complaint' is the game is rough on my thumbs!Dead serious, the game is worth every penny, even if you don't play it long.			",122,32,0,39,29,0,24

												Let me say I don't enjoy shmups or bullet-hell games or whatever you want to call them, but I really enjoyed this game. It's very short, few hours at most, though the game expands its playtime if you do the optional challenge missions. The story is ridiculous but also endearing, dealing with a space-colonial British Empire colonizing Mars in the 17th century, and the conflict with the Spanish and Spanish-allied Martians. You fly a space ship and fight all kinds of classically arcade-styled enemies set to a very good soundtrack. It's difficult but not punishingly so like a lot of shmups, enough that I had an enjoyable challenge. If you really love shmups you might find it different from other ones you've played, and if you don't like it, I'd recommend a try.			",712,200,33,112,78,8,163

												My god does this game make you feel accomplished when beating stuff. I highly reccomend it as one of my favorite steam games to constantly go back to when I feel I need a challenge. The best part about this game is it can adapt to your difficulty on any scale. If you want to sit back and play through a level or be completely and utterly destroyed within a second the variety is there.

												I'll start first by saying, there are many top-down-shooters and scrollers being released today, it can be hard to find one that truly differentiates itself from the rest, with so many following a tried-and-tested remedy that can soon get stale, skepticism is understandable. However, this is where things change, through a very appealing art style, wonderful soundtrack and addictive gameplay, 'Jamestown: Legend of the Lost Colony' does exactly that, it differentiates, and in a hugely successful way.

												One of the best SHMUPs created this generation. If you enjoy the genre then you should definitely buy Jamestown, and add it to your collection. It has great art direction and wonderful music. It has a cool score multiplier mechanic and there are ships to ulock and buy. I really enjoy the story as well. Which is told from the first person perspective, with text and picture art. The actual writing is very thoughtful and well done. The only negative I could point to is, your progression through the story is stopped after the third level. Until, you play those levels again on a higher difficulty. This feature repeats itself several times. For some, this may be a plus. For those who prefer to play their games on normal it may be an issue. But those who enjoy this style of gameplay will most likely appreciate it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jamestown is an awesome retro manic shooter. Produced by indie-developers who really understands what the genre is all about. Jamestown can be regarded as an excellent entry-level ""danmaku"" (bullet curtain) - or bullet hell 2D-shooter. I can recommend this game for anyone who is new to the genre (like myself) as this game really eases you into the gameplay.High-appeal graphics, excellent music score and effects, addictive gameplay. What more can you ask for? The difficulty can be adjusted but the highest levels of difficulty will have you struggling for quite a while!			",155,59,1,36,15,0,25

												This game delivers on all fronts with great music, visuals and fun gameplay.While the main campaign only consists of 5 relatively short levels, the game has great replay value because of the various difficulty settings. Each of the four ships has its own strengths and weaknesses and require different tactics to succesfully use, again adding to the replay value. On top of that there's the gauntlet mode, challenges and numerous other unlocks.The only negative aspect about this game is the lack of an online co-op, but if you can get over that then this game is definitely worth the money.

												Jamestown is a wonderful indie shoot-em-up with tight controls and colorful, detailed graphics matching its quirky story and setting.At its core, Jamestown has all the trappings of a classic shoot-em-up. You fly a ship. You shoot aliens and dodge bullets. Things explode. There are six stages total which you can choose to play individually or nonstop via the ""Gauntlet"" mode.The game has two claim-to-fame mechanics, one of which is the Vaunt system, which charges by picking up enemy drops and provides a small bullet-erasing shield (the ""bomb""), as well as increasing your shot power and score multiplier for the duration of the Vaunt.The second unique feature is support for up to not two, but FOUR players via local co-op that can use any combination of mice, keyboards, and gamepads. Additionally, if one player falls, another can revive them mid-stage.I recommend Jamestown wholeheartedly as both a shoot-em-up and as a game, period. The quality is high; the price is low: Check it out.			",131,14,0,24,3,0,28

												I wish it was longer; but at the same time with the difficulty choices being vastly harder than the next makes it have good replayability.  It is a SHMUP type of game, so if you're into them you'll feel at home here.			",291,54,4,50,13,2,22

												In this slightly inaccurate* retelling of classic American history and bullet hell, you and any number of (local multiplayer only) friends will blast things that want to blast you first.  It is great with friends, but it looks like it wouldn't be fun alone, and it is full of attempts at getting you to buy DLC.*To say this retelling of classic American history is slightly inaccurate, is slightly inaccurate.

												This is one of the best shooters I have ever played. This game presents multiple levels at an escalating difficulty, where both beginners and hardcore shooter fans can enjoy. Each level are carefully ensembled with typical shooter elements and mechanics that often appear in Japanese vertical scroll such as Touhou, but it is done with a fantastic degree of perfection. Soundtrack fits amazingly well with the colonial/futuristic fusion setting, and makes the experience much more intense and entertaining. There also are plenty of extras you can enjoy after beating the main storyline. Overall, this game was a very pleasant experience.			",412,105,6,51,43,3,53

												This game is the shooter game for anyone who likes shooter games but just can't seem to figure out how to play them well. This game starts you off slowly allowing you to essentially learn how to play. You can play on easier levels but must play on higher levels in order to get further in the game.

												Clearly the folks at Final Form are genuine shooter connoisseurs: The shoutouts to games like DoDonPachi, Guwange, ESP Ra. De., and especially Progear are quite apparent here. It's a Cave love letter through and through, but with modern sensibilities like proper screen resolution, unlockables, and built-in any-gamepad support. It's not quite on the level of Cave's best work, but that's not really the point. It's very well realized, enough so so that if this had come out in arcades back in the late 90s it would've become a classic. Definitely worth picking up and checking out. Also, plays gloriously on an HRAP3 arcade stick and a Saturn USB pad, so bust out your arcade controller of choice.			",734,184,6,97,41,7,86

												Jamestown is the R-Type impersonator that you always wished for with a focus on COOP gameplay. Sometimes when I am playing I feel this is a bit like ikaruga - but not quite as brutal. To get the most enjoyment ouf this game you need three or four friends for some local COOP. Jamestown will work with any USB controllers you have lying around and does the button configurations in the most slick way I've seen yet; it makes setup super easy. The primary complaint is that the difficulty does a very poor job of scaling to the number of people playing. On any of the harder difficulties one player is impossible, two is OK, three is easier, and four is MUCH easier - for this reason I only play when I have exactly four people visiting. Despite this the graphics are great and the interface is seamless. DLC is meh. 7.5/10 for an indie title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Solo, this game is a fantastic shooter with a lot of excellent design and a good mix of challenge and playability (depending where you fall on the difficulty scale). With partners, though (local only), it becomes a frantic challenge where the rest of you have to stay alive to keep anyone else in the game - one of you falls and the rest can't die. You only have one life between you all to split.It's excellent and also lets you choose to play level-by-level or all at once like most arcade titles would.

												Edit: I decided to re-write part of my review, because I think it's a crying shame more people haven't played this.I've played a lot of arcade shooters, both old ones and ones made within the last year (or five), and I have to say that Jamestown is probably the most aesthetically pleasing shooter I've played in decades, and easily the best western-made shooter by far. The excellent input customization is really crazy compared to other games coming out lately. The game just works right out of the box, period, no matter what input you have or what problems you're used to.The music is beyond excellent and the graphics are superb, the entire game has a nostalgic quality that comes from successful emulation of older japanese-made arcade shooters from the 80's and 90's. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone, you merely need to enjoy old-school shooters to get the full effect of and appreciation for the game itself.  It's quite forgiving at low difficulty, and higher difficulties stay challenging even after a few playthroughs. The highest difficulty levels are pretty rough for me, and I have a penchant for the whole bullet-hell genre. My only 'complaint' is the game is rough on my thumbs!Dead serious, the game is worth every penny, even if you don't play it long.			",122,32,0,39,29,0,24

												Let me say I don't enjoy shmups or bullet-hell games or whatever you want to call them, but I really enjoyed this game. It's very short, few hours at most, though the game expands its playtime if you do the optional challenge missions. The story is ridiculous but also endearing, dealing with a space-colonial British Empire colonizing Mars in the 17th century, and the conflict with the Spanish and Spanish-allied Martians. You fly a space ship and fight all kinds of classically arcade-styled enemies set to a very good soundtrack. It's difficult but not punishingly so like a lot of shmups, enough that I had an enjoyable challenge. If you really love shmups you might find it different from other ones you've played, and if you don't like it, I'd recommend a try.			",712,201,33,112,78,8,163

												A very fun and very good shmup. The graphics are fantastic, excellent vibrant pixel art crawling with details and wonderful animations. It looks fantastic in motion. The controls are very smooth, the vault and special buttons are very well implemented and the different types of ships each make for a slightly different twist on the game. I like the Gunner myself and the ability to steer bullets ala options in Gradius 5. The game is highly replayable thanks to multiple difficulty levels and the levels themselves are rather short. Each level can be played through in under 5 minutes. True there are only 5 levels in the core game, but I keep revisiting them time and time again. The addition of multiplayer and score rankings only adds to the fun. Besides the 5 main levels there are challenge levels and lots of unlockables to unlock. Gameplay wise this is one of the finest shooters I've played - and I'm an avid shmup fan. For the money and the value, you really can't go wrong here.			",61,29,1,7,8,0,8

												If you think you might play this with friends (local) get it right away!The gunplay is awesome, with varied ships/weapons/bombs. There's also a special vaunt action that absorbs attacks, it works by collecting pickups (cogs/wheels/gears) that fill up a meter, the more it's full the longer you can vaunt. This makes the game really fun for me, because it takes away from some of the cumbersome elements of many shmups. i.e. many bullets.Controller support is superb, you can grab about any HID device and it will work.Easily my favorite top down shooter for PC.

												Lovely shoot 'em up. I normally don't enjoy these kinds of games since there is a lot of skill, as well as luck, involved. And they can be frustratingly difficult. I really don't know why I like this one. It has excellent sprite graphics, the most beautiful music, good controls, unlockables and small (but hard) levels. The game isn't very long, but it has some really difficult bonus levels that you can try. It's absurd. But... I just couldn't stop (re)playing them. And that, my friends, is why I enjoy this game so much. One simple word with a complex meaning: addiction.By the way, you can play this game with up to four players. Great if you want a little co-op action :) In short: buy it ![Rating: 78/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Packed with fun gameplay, smooth controls, awesome soundtrack, great pixel art graphics and steampunk aesthetics makes this bullet hell shmup worth getting. The only downside is that them multiplayer is local, but if you got some friends or family to play with, you can have four times the fun out of the main story chapters and challenges.

												I personally am absolutely terrible at this game, but it is a ton of fun for a top down classic-style shooter. I like that it ISN'T  a straight run through on one quarter sort of game, but makes you earn access to the higher levels, and the challenges are a blast (even if I do die within moments of starting XD). Worth the price.			",144,33,2,20,13,5,11

												When asked about bullet hell shmups I would normally mention CAVE shooters or ZUN's touhou games but this game which made an appearance on steam can hold it's on in the bullet hell category. You have your pick of 4 ships which have their own special ability and try to get through all the levels. Every ship has a gaunt ability which gives a shield which will protect them and teammates that are within the range of that shield. Other modes include challenge missions one can do for more unlocks.			",343,62,0,39,13,3,23

												Old school arcade with absolutely great music (I dowonloaded the soundtrack, it's that good). Addictive, enjoyable and chalenging. And supports 4 player coop on the same monitor (sadly, no online coop, but it would difficult to pull it of properly with that many enemy bullets on the screen flying simultanously.

												Despite my deep love for the old ""1945"" top-down shooters; I think this game, hands-down, is the most enjoyable experience I've ever had with the genre.It seems like a bit of a silly concept at first; but from very impressive artistic direction and enthralling music, one can't help but quickly get caught up in the experience - the finale, and thus the whole adventure, is positively epic!

												This game is pretty fun if you have friends to play with. It's probably one of the best co-op shmups out there. However it's not a good single player experience.The game is pretty much reliant on memorization ala psikyo games, except it's 100x more annoying because the bullets don't spawn corresponding to the location of the enemies and the ships are rather slow. Enemies can also shoot you off screen because of this annoying quirk. The scoring system is pretty shallow too, collect coins and vaunt your way through the stage, it's not super fun. The ships are simply useless in single player. The challenge levels are fun, there's that I suppose. But as a complete shmup experience for enthusiasts of the genre I cannot recommend it in any way.Another thing that annoys me is that it's a vertizontal game. It would be preferrable to have it in a 4:3 area or tate 3:4 like most other shmups on steam.By far the best part of the game is the soundtrack. Top marks there I cannot complain.

												Jamestown is the first ""Bullet Hell"" game I've sank any sort of time into and I absolutely love it. The difficulty progression for someone unskilled in the genre is excellent with the final difficulties becoming suitably difficult for those experienced. There is a nice variety of ships to choose from for different playstyles including the ability to play each level individually or all in one run in 'Gauntlet"" mode. If you get tired of the the primary 5 levels, there are quite a few challenge levels to keep you busy. If you are interested in this type of game at all, it's definitely worth picking up. I got it in a bundle for $1 and it's definitely one of the best dollars I've spent.			",548,184,12,74,40,7,70

												Woo, quite litterally Jamestown is a blast!Think of it as Gunsmoke meets Raiden meets Ikaruga. If you know what ANY of those games are, you're gonna want to pick this one up for sure.If you don't, well then know that it's a fast paced top down scrolling shooter with a cowboys on mars setting.Plow through 6 story missions each with 6 difficulties with 4 different ships as well as dozens of challenge modes and a hardcore mode.It's a lot more than that sounds like on paper, because you will meet your match eventually and need to really get some shooter skill to finish out the hardest of the hard modes and achivements. But hey, people don't play games like this because they're easy.It's fast, its frantic, it's pure bullet hell at some of the higher difficulties. The story is fast and loose but interesting, and the with the scoring system and leaderboards, you just might be replaying levels shooting (heh) for a highscore over and over.When I first saw screenshots for Jamestown I hoped it would be this type of game and I couldn't be more pleased that it is, and its a very good one.

												Jamestown is a ""bullet hell"" vertical shooter made with a retro 16-bit art style. Fans of similar SHMUPS (Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun, etc) should pick this up without any hesitation. It's really good, but also very frustrating at times (as with most games in this genre). But if you have the skills and patience required, this is a no-brainer. For everyone else... I'm not so sure. Sure, it's a solid game and very fun, but unless you have 'mad skills' (or a lot of time on your hands), I'm not sure how long you'll be able to play before your patience wears thin. Personally, I was able to at least finish the game and get through a bulk of the challenges before giving up out of frustration (hey, I'm old!), but YMMV. Still, to me, even seeing half of what this game offers was worth the asking price. I should also mention that it has great music and a very odd story (some kind of weird alternate history involving the lost colony of Roanoke and Mars... don't ask). Anyways, check it out!

Product received for free
												I must admit that when I had the opportunity to review Jamestown, a title developed & published by Final Form Games, I immediately jumped at the chance - being the avid shmup fanatic that I am. And let's face it, within the Steam universe there certainly exists no shortage of mediocre ones to play...those that tried to emulate the heart & soul of arcade shooters but which ultimately lacked that certain magic and polish to them. However I always heard very glowing accolades about this particular title, but are they warranted? Let's find out below.The game touts itself as having ""lovingly handcrafted pixels"", and it is my pleasure to report that these retro-styled 2D graphics are absolutely superb, easily evoking the look & feel of its 1990's era arcade brethren with its charming yet familiar style...making me quickly feel right at home. And I must also say that it's a very colorful game as well, sporting vibrantly rich hues and pretty bullet patterns which instantly dazzle the senses. The artwork itself is themed from a ""17th-century British Colonial Mars"" motif, and it seems to work quite well, especially since it also includes a matching storyline to add a bit more distinction to this title. The story itself is wholly superfluous to be sure, because with a shmup we all know gameplay is truly the cornerstone of the experience, but I found it to be a nice touch nonetheless and there is a decent amount of skippable text which can be read by those seeking to capture the full essence of Jamestown.As far as its music & audio go, it was superb all around...with punchy bullet & explosion sounds overlayed atop beautiful orchestral arrangments which seemed to perfectly fit in with the theme of this memorable game.Now getting back to its gameplay here, this is a dreamy kind of bullet hell indeed in that it's very challenging yet always fair. And the wonderful part about it is that you have both primary and secondary weapons which can be alternated seamlessly throughout each level, as well as a tertiary ""Vaunt Meter"" which is a time-limited power-up/shield combo whereby you first have to collect gold from destroyed enemies to recharge before using again (you simply move toward the falling gold and it scoops up automatically within your proximity).And if that wasn't enough, what truly impressed me most about it by far, is the ability to play both online and local co-op with up to four players. This adds a very interesting dynamic to the game since the way it is uniquely implemented consists of only one player needing to survive the level in order for the entire team to succeed, whereby everyone respawns once more to continue off playing the next successive one. And I must confess that with so many bullets flying in Jamestown, having the ability to lean on your team-mates in this way is a definite plus. Because death can come surprisingly fast and unexpectedly when playing on any of the several difficulties higher than normal - just massage one single bullet the wrong way and you're a goner to be sure! Which in the end makes it all the more addictive and challenging, undoubtedly infusing a lot more replay value into it.But nonetheless I do have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed by how few levels there were to enjoy (only 5). It's just so much exhilarating fun to experience, that I very soon wanted more Jamestown to play...perhaps twice as much. In fact easily twice as much. And while there is a DLC available which adds in more ships, I somehow felt that the base game just wasn't quite meaty enough for my taste...but then again at its price-point I suppose this can be somewhat understandable...but still...I did decidedly expect a decent amount more content in this regard.VerdictHaving said that, you will be absolutely spoiled in no time after playing this gem...make no mistake about it. It hits all the high notes with ease as far as its frenetically fun gameplay & presentation goes. And it certainly plays very well with no discernable issues noticed. I suppose I will have no choice now but to pick up the DLC for it, because while immersing myself within this one, it felt just like I was being transported back inside the 1990's arcades...with those unforgettable chains of explosive delight ricocheting between my ears...and eventually soon finding their way to a soft spot inside my heart. This shoot'em'up masterpiece receives a 4.5 out of 5 stars from me.Pros:- Exceptionally satisfying gameplay with responsive controls- Includes a somewhat interesting and novel story- Co-op and local co-op (up to 4 players)- Remappable controls and full controller support- Unlockable ships/weapons (along with a shop)- Unlockable bonus levels- Pleasing & colorful retro-styled aesthetics- Game screen can be optionally stretched to cover the entire area of your monitor - Steam achievements (30+)- Online leaderboards Cons:- Far too few levels in the game, the most glaring drawback with itFor similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com ",2033,734,85,132,116,17,145

												Jamestown is a top-down shoot 'em up with a strong retro vibe and local multiplayer support. It's clearly inspired by the various Japanese bullet hell games, even if it isn't quite as good as the best of them.As a single-player game Jamestown is passable but not particularly great. There's nothing truly innovative here with either the gameplay or enemy designs. The soundtrack is great but the art design is somewhat uneven. I quite liked the level art itself but wasn't a massive fan of the ship designs.The campaign has only five short levels, which shouldn't take too long to finish. Be warned though, that the developer did make the highly dubious decision to force you to play on higher difficulties to unlock the last two levels. Personally I didn't have too many issues playing Jamestown through on legendary, but if you are not very good with these type of games you are basically stuck playing only the first three or four levels.Not really recommended for the single player experience unless you are a big fan of bullet hell games. It's probably much more fun in local co-op, however.The good:- Great soundtrack- Beautiful retro-style backgroundsThe bad:- Quite short- Rather ugly ship designs- Aggressive ingame marketing of the DLC pack- Later levels can only be unlocked on legendary or above			",563,231,11,89,49,8,102

Why can't I? Because I tend to play these games on one player, which is a common way to play for a lot of shmups, especially the Japanese arcade variety. After playing this game for a fairly lengthy amount of time it's painfully obvious that the ships and levels were definitely designed more around you playing as multiplayer. The whole vertizontal setup, lots of space for enemies to spawn and shoot from, is all very good if you were to move extremely quickly. But no, most of the ships in this environment feel like you're trying to pilot Grimlen from Great Mahou Daisakusen and you don't have any bombs to combat the fact you can barely move to where the enemies are.I'd like to imagine this game is probably a lot of fun with two players or more, but from a single player perspective this game is infuriating. Keep that in mind if you're looking into getting this.			",107,49,3,9,11,3,23

												Exactly what it says on the tin: a retro shooter with lots of charm, awesome multiplayer (LOCAL ONLY!!!!), and a small amount of replayability. Criminally short campaign, but that is characteristic of the genre.			",590,167,10,85,43,4,95

												Jamestown is one of the most polished and refined vertical shooters out there. The whole game is designed around co-op play with up to 3 other players, where you lose a life/continue only when all players on screen are dead. Furthermore, the game provides players with ability to revive their dead teammates by picking up power-ups that drop from specific big enemies.Absolutely an amazing quality scrolling shooter!

												A visually pleasing vertical-scrolling shooter. Touhou-reminiscent dodging and bullet density with a whimsical retro-futuristic art style that reminds me a bit of Metal Slug.  The enemies behave like Raiden or Tyrian, coming from all angles or out of the scenery, but the bullets behave like Touhou, killing you in one shot if they come into contact with your small hitbox, located in the center of your character sprite.  This game has several difficulty levels to cater to any tier of gamer. Another surprise was the novel and intuitive scoring system. This is a gem of its genre and deserves your attention.

												Now here's a good indie game. Jamestown is a top-down shooter (such as 19XX) with the odd plot of being a convict on the lamb trying to redeem your name in the new world. The year is 1619, and the new world happens to be Mars.You battle your way through Martian and Spanish forces and uncover a diabolical plot all in the safety of the cutscenes. The rest of the time you're blowing your way through anything that gets in your way.The 4 ships you have to choose from are a bit limiting, but varied and each useful in their own way. This is also where the game shows it's true awesomeness. If you can get some friends together on the same computer, you can team up with whatever selection of ships you want and blow away the Martians and evil Spanish.A great game, I'd advise it for anyone.

												While I personally can't compare Jamestown to the entire Touhou Project as I've only played a couple titles from the series, this game is a fantastic bullet-hell shooter on the high difficulties, and an enjoyable vertical shooter on the lower difficulties. It's the most fun I've had since Ikaruga and Gigawing 2. If you're a fan of Raiden, Raptor: Call of the Shadows, or even Gradius, I highly suggest you pick this one up and give it a shot.There are several levels, a couple dozen challenge levels, eight different ships with two firing modes each, and a combo system that encourages skillful movement, positioning, and awareness. If you're a real master at bullet-hell games, I'll admit that Jamestown might be too easy for your liking to get through - but mastering the combo system takes time, patience, and is very rewarding once you can tie together a huge string of hits.It's available in the Humble Indie Bundle 4 if you want more bang for your buck, but it stands alone quite nicely.

												If you are a fan of the bullet hell style shooters such as the Touhou series or the Gundemonium games, then James town is the perfect game for you. I actually like the fact that the final level can only be played on the highest challenge option, it makes things that much more interesting.Then there's the array of Challenge maps that can be played aside from the story it's self. One of the biggest bonuses this game has over others in this same genre is that it supports up to 4 person multi-player. While the graphics are simple they're still visually captivating and hearken back to the SNES days with a 16-bit reminiscent style.  The music is well picked and along with the graphics provide the right atmosphere for this game. I say if you like bullet hell style shooters play this game, and I feel this is also a good place for people new this type of game to start with it's progressing difficulty that allows you to work up to final boss.

												Great bullet-hell sh'mup with outstanding 32bit pixel art graphics.  Difficulty isn't outrageous but it will certainly push you eye/hand coordination to their limits.  Lots of bonus challenge missions keep things fun after you finish the main story and multiple ships with different abilities encourage repeats on the story missions.  If you got ninja-like reflexes the higher difficulties will have you cursing at the gods.  Only big downside for me was I wished there was 1 or 2 more story stages to give it just a tad more bulk.  Otherwise, more than worthy purchase.			",202,84,2,18,11,3,27

												A fairly general 2d shootemup game. Dodge the enemies and their weapons, while shooting back hard. Jamestown Colony on Mars was an interesting setting choice for sure. Nice but not outstanding Indie effort overall. The whole RPG mechanic kind of threw a wrench in the idea of improving yourself to overcome the challenges, and changes the psychology of repeating a stage to improve yourself to grinding a stage to improve the character. 3/5			",2087,884,76,270,298,28,379

												There's a reason that I displayed screenshots from this game on my Steam home page.  This game is SO INCREDIBLY COOL!  This is a perfect classic shooter with sprite based graphics that rival anything hand drawn today!  This game is a hard bullet hell game, but its also fair.

												Steam logs ~2 hours to my playtime, and a significant portion of that played with my 6-year-old in co-op, so it's not terribly long, but does provide a challenge (it was more difficult with a child weighing me down).  Jamestown is... fine. It's a bullet-hell shmup. If you like that kind of thing and want to be a perfectionist at it, then Jamestown gives you the venue. The story is unusual - a colonial era story but for some reason set on Mars instead of the American colonies, but with all the heroes and villains of the colonial era. Other than that, there's some bonus stage unlocks and some advanced difficulty options. So yeah.  4 player co-op bullet-hell shmup. You kinda know if this kind of this is for you.

												Jamestown is one of the most polished and refined vertical shooters out there. The whole game is designed around co-op play with up to 3 other players, where you lose a life/continue only when all players on screen are dead. Furthermore, the game provides players with ability to revive their dead teammates by picking up power-ups that drop from specific big enemies.Absolutely an amazing quality scrolling shooter!

												This is the best game I ever got by accident. It was part of a humble bundle that I bought just for the game Closure, and had no intention of playing Jamestown. Ironically, I ended up playing Closure for all of 20 minutes, and I've invested nearly 10 hours into this one.I rarely even play shooters, and yet this game is thoroughly addicting and enjoyable. What I like most is the simplicity. It takes 5 minutes to learn everything there is to know about how to play, and you can jump right in on the lowest difficulty and have some fun without getting crushed right away. The difficulty scales very well, and each stage requires you to beat all the previous stages on a higher difficulty level than the one before to unlock the next stage. It's a natural progression, and is suitable even for someone like myself who isn't a veteran to these types of games. That being said, there are only five stages in the game which are each very short, but they are well designed and have high replay value. On top of that there are five challenge packs that you can purchase using in game currency, which range from challenging to rage inducing.But what really makes this game most enjoyable are the beautiful 16-bit sprites and the art direction. A high level of detail was put into each stage, and some of the backgrounds are gorgeous. It's only too bad you don't have much time to look at them as you're constantly dodging bullets. It's got that classic old school look but at the same time has an aesthetic all its own. Plus the explosions look great, and I love how you collect gold from each enemy you destroy. Each time you blow up a ship and those chunks of gold pieces come falling down the screen, it's a real treat and feels so rewarding. Oh, and the soundtrack is awesome too.All in all, if you're a fan of schmup games, this is a must buy. I paid practically nothing for it, but can say it's easily worth 10 bucks. And if you can get it on sale ($4.99 when I wrote this) then it's a no brainer.			",19,6,0,1,0,0,1

												Believe it or not, Jamestown is a Bullet Hell game that isn't completely about Bullet Hell. Jamestown is a beautiful top-down arcade SHMUP that can be picked up and played by anyone, a casual gamer or a Touhou veteran. There are five different difficulty levels with each level adding more and more bullets that can riddle your ship (but not kill you unless it hits the middle). The downside if you're a casual player is that you only have three levels, the other three levels require you to be playing on the harder difficulties, cutting the experience in half.If you're willing to put your neck out there and aim for the skies, Jamestown is an experience you'd be foolish to pass up.If you aren't willing, well, the game's still pretty damn awesome.

												Although it looks daunting from previews, Jamestown offers a solid bullet hell shump. This game is well crafted in and out, giving a great experience even to those not so accustomed to bullet hell, like me. The story is an alternate history of the real Jamestown set on Mars with aliens along with the period rivarly between Britain and Spain. Steampunk rules the time as complex machinery and shooting ships are used. The art is in pixel art, supporting the story and giving a special style to the game. Music is a mix of orchestra and rock and some synths, providing for a kick♥♥♥♥♥theme when playing. These 3 are all solidly made. Difficulty starts at a low level, but the game ramps it up on later levels and forces revisiting older levels on a higher difficulty. By the last level, the game is really tough but memorizing and dodging is key. The game is short, I got 2 hrs for the main story but it gave a great experience and challenge. Bonuses keep players back for more.			",106,20,5,4,5,2,24

												A visually pleasing vertical-scrolling shooter. Touhou-reminiscent dodging and bullet density with a whimsical retro-futuristic art style that reminds me a bit of Metal Slug.  The enemies behave like Raiden or Tyrian, coming from all angles or out of the scenery, but the bullets behave like Touhou, killing you in one shot if they come into contact with your small hitbox, located in the center of your character sprite.  This game has several difficulty levels to cater to any tier of gamer. Another surprise was the novel and intuitive scoring system. This is a gem of its genre and deserves your attention.

												Now here's a good indie game. Jamestown is a top-down shooter (such as 19XX) with the odd plot of being a convict on the lamb trying to redeem your name in the new world. The year is 1619, and the new world happens to be Mars.You battle your way through Martian and Spanish forces and uncover a diabolical plot all in the safety of the cutscenes. The rest of the time you're blowing your way through anything that gets in your way.The 4 ships you have to choose from are a bit limiting, but varied and each useful in their own way. This is also where the game shows it's true awesomeness. If you can get some friends together on the same computer, you can team up with whatever selection of ships you want and blow away the Martians and evil Spanish.A great game, I'd advise it for anyone.

												While I personally can't compare Jamestown to the entire Touhou Project as I've only played a couple titles from the series, this game is a fantastic bullet-hell shooter on the high difficulties, and an enjoyable vertical shooter on the lower difficulties. It's the most fun I've had since Ikaruga and Gigawing 2. If you're a fan of Raiden, Raptor: Call of the Shadows, or even Gradius, I highly suggest you pick this one up and give it a shot.There are several levels, a couple dozen challenge levels, eight different ships with two firing modes each, and a combo system that encourages skillful movement, positioning, and awareness. If you're a real master at bullet-hell games, I'll admit that Jamestown might be too easy for your liking to get through - but mastering the combo system takes time, patience, and is very rewarding once you can tie together a huge string of hits.It's available in the Humble Indie Bundle 4 if you want more bang for your buck, but it stands alone quite nicely.

												If you're into bullet-hell shooters, this is the game for you!The gameplay is tight and well made, with four different ships to choose from (three that have to be unlocked through playing the game) with very different play styles. The visual aesthetic is unique and works well for the game. The story itself is pretty out there, but for a bullet-hell game, the story isn't really why we're here, now is it?All in all, the game is worth the price, especially if you can get some friends together.

												This is the best game I ever got by accident. It was part of a humble bundle that I bought just for the game Closure, and had no intention of playing Jamestown. Ironically, I ended up playing Closure for all of 20 minutes, and I've invested nearly 10 hours into this one.I rarely even play shooters, and yet this game is thoroughly addicting and enjoyable. What I like most is the simplicity. It takes 5 minutes to learn everything there is to know about how to play, and you can jump right in on the lowest difficulty and have some fun without getting crushed right away. The difficulty scales very well, and each stage requires you to beat all the previous stages on a higher difficulty level than the one before to unlock the next stage. It's a natural progression, and is suitable even for someone like myself who isn't a veteran to these types of games. That being said, there are only five stages in the game which are each very short, but they are well designed and have high replay value. On top of that there are five challenge packs that you can purchase using in game currency, which range from challenging to rage inducing.But what really makes this game most enjoyable are the beautiful 16-bit sprites and the art direction. A high level of detail was put into each stage, and some of the backgrounds are gorgeous. It's only too bad you don't have much time to look at them as you're constantly dodging bullets. It's got that classic old school look but at the same time has an aesthetic all its own. Plus the explosions look great, and I love how you collect gold from each enemy you destroy. Each time you blow up a ship and those chunks of gold pieces come falling down the screen, it's a real treat and feels so rewarding. Oh, and the soundtrack is awesome too.All in all, if you're a fan of schmup games, this is a must buy. I paid practically nothing for it, but can say it's easily worth 10 bucks. And if you can get it on sale ($4.99 when I wrote this) then it's a no brainer.			",19,6,0,1,0,0,1

												Fans of top-down shmups (shoot 'em ups) need look no further than Jamestown. While not quite as punishing as the Japanese variety in this genre, the difficulty scales up intelligently and the game eases you into the action. In order to progress farther in the game you have to get better and the game helps you get better by forcing you to play higher difficulty levels as you progress through the game. It sounds cheap, but in games like this it's way too easy to keep the difficulty low and storm through the game. The way the game progresses will show you (even those unfamiliar with the genre) how good you can be at dodging through a screenful of glowing lazers and suicidal enemy ships. Online and local multiplayer, challenges, and a quirky ""farce"" mode makes this game great to play if you have extra time here and there.			",137,15,3,9,5,3,11

The enemies are fun to kill and defeating bosses provides tons of extra gratification. If the main story wasn't enough, there are five difficulty levels for each world, a continuous gauntlet mode, and challenge levels for extra hours of play time. Bomber and Gunner ships add a whole new difficult level as well.Then, if you have some friends who want to play--there's multiplayer!			",63,12,2,9,9,0,9

												Jamestown is an old school bullet hell arcade shooter, but with 4 player co-op. In that regard already it's quite unique and interesting. The only way to make bullet hell games more visually chaotic is the addition of more players. But what makes Jamestown more interesting is it's setting, story, and presentation. It's basicly a sci-fi steam-punk neo-classical retelling of the early days of the English American colonies. You face the forces of the Martian/Spanish alliance in hopes of being pardoned for a crime against the English crown. The orchestral soundtrack and story scenes somehow make this seem more epic than you expect, even if it is a bit silly. And the entire package feels polished and well made. There are unlockables and bonus missions to keep dragging you back, even if it is a short game; and there're always high scores to be challenged. One of my favourite bullet-hell games ever.

												Inspired by space shooters of the old days, Jamestown is short and filled with action (perhaps a bit more playable for novices than really old space shooters).The graphics and soundtrack are pretty good too. Jamestown doesn't feel new, but thankfully, that isn't a requirement for fun!			",2946,1218,116,340,427,27,495

												Jamestown is a shmup period. For the old school fans of the genre you will find this game incredible. I must note that the soundtrack for this game is incredible. It really adds to the atmosphere of its historical setting. You will find yourself head bobbing along to the songs. For the price today pick it up. Only downside is there is NO online multiplayer and only supports local play. Should you want to play with friends. Order the pizza and bring in the beers and have a blast with jamestown.

A charming shooter with plenty of depth, combos, ships, enemies, landscapes and beautiful 16bit/pixel artwork, which ties in with the 17th century space colonial steampunk story.Other great features include xbox controller support and the ability to play co-op with up to three friends on one computer by playing with mouse and keyboards as separate ""controllers"" and with plenty of different game difficulties and challenges to unlock, there's loads to keep you busy.

												Bullet-Hell At It's FinestI'm a sucker for pixels, games that make me want to punch a wall (if well made, not due to blatantly shoddy construction... i'm describing the games... not the wall), and fiction loosely based on actual events. Jamestown quenches all of these thirsts along with an unexpectedly stunning soundtrack to create a wonderful shooter for both the novice and the masochistic.This top-down arcade sci-fi shmup is all about style. Difficulties can be chosen before each stage, ranging from the easiest resembling 1942 to Insane which will challenge any fan of the Touhou series. (If you don't know touhou, find it on youtube and it will make your eyes bleed. In a good way.)Multiple ships (with more available via DLC!), a wide array of difficulties, and an in-game unlockables via gold gained for blowing things up and creating long bonus string allow for many return plays, for both quick breaks or marathon sessions.One downside - The 4-player Coop is SINGLE MACHINE ONLY. There is no online option. It's great for having a few people together, but in this day and age, not having online multiplayer can really limit popularity of a title. But... THAT'S IT! Everything else is a big thumbs up.It's even got an unlockable ""parody"" mode. Doesn't change much, but it really adds a lovely transparency to the developers' love of oldschool shooters.This is a shining example of what the indie game scene can do. Do yourself a favor and pick this beast up.			",694,167,20,47,47,6,65

												If you like bullet-hell games such as Touhou, Ikaruga, DoDonPachi, Radiant Silvergun, etc. then there shouldn't be a reason why you wouldn't like this one.  The game features an addictive point system and has some nifty features to make you keep playing for a while.  Trying to get higher in the leaderboards is always a fun thing.  The game is difficult as this genre is known for so it isn't for the casual player.  Although, the game does feature multiple difficulty levels to allow players for some practice if you are new to the genre.  Besides, 10 bucks isn't a bad deal.  I will say that the story is very odd, which shouldn't be surprising as most of these shooters have off-the-wall story lines and aren't really story driven anyway.  Just go in and enjoy trying to post some high scores..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Believe it or not, Jamestown is a Bullet Hell game that isn't completely about Bullet Hell. Jamestown is a beautiful top-down arcade SHMUP that can be picked up and played by anyone, a casual gamer or a Touhou veteran. There are five different difficulty levels with each level adding more and more bullets that can riddle your ship (but not kill you unless it hits the middle). The downside if you're a casual player is that you only have three levels, the other three levels require you to be playing on the harder difficulties, cutting the experience in half.If you're willing to put your neck out there and aim for the skies, Jamestown is an experience you'd be foolish to pass up.If you aren't willing, well, the game's still pretty damn awesome.

Cons - very short (5 levels, about 20 challenges), that horrible frustration of super hard shooter levels.  Bottom line - worth it on sale if you like this kind of shooter.			",733,177,23,71,37,7,90

												Fans of top-down shmups (shoot 'em ups) need look no further than Jamestown. While not quite as punishing as the Japanese variety in this genre, the difficulty scales up intelligently and the game eases you into the action. In order to progress farther in the game you have to get better and the game helps you get better by forcing you to play higher difficulty levels as you progress through the game. It sounds cheap, but in games like this it's way too easy to keep the difficulty low and storm through the game. The way the game progresses will show you (even those unfamiliar with the genre) how good you can be at dodging through a screenful of glowing lazers and suicidal enemy ships. Online and local multiplayer, challenges, and a quirky ""farce"" mode makes this game great to play if you have extra time here and there.			",137,15,3,9,5,3,11

												TL;DR:  it's a bullet hell shmup, which is the only deciding factor as to whether you'll like this game.If you dislike flying a widdle ship through a maze of deadly glowing balls, you won't like Jamestown.  But if you're at least open to possibly enjoying such a game, you'll like, even love Jamestown.Its only real flaw is that its premise and story are a bit overdone (Walter Raleigh flees the Spanish in the seventeenth century by escaping to the New World, except the New World is Mars), but the execution is masterful, from the beautiful eight-bit sprites to the solid mechanics to the surprisingly superb soundtrack.There's unlockable challenge strages, multiple ships with different secondary firing modes, a ramping difficulty to keep you improving, and even DLC with three more ships (including a fourth that randomly mimics one of the other seven).  And seriously, that music.  Kinda freakin' awesome.			",212,52,2,19,14,0,27

												Shmup with gorgeous retro arcade graphics. Its very short with only 5 levels, but there are 4 ships in the base game to play with for a little variety on repeat playthroughs. With all the tlc put into the artwork I can understand why it is so short. Coop is local only unfortunately. Great game, you might want to get this as part of the Humble Indie Bundle 4 while its still up.			",486,132,11,76,48,4,73

Historical figures come up in the context of the Mars colonies in the 17th century, and ride various contraptions to fight ever more difficult waves of weird monsters.This is a bullet hell type of shooter, especially on the better difficulty settings.

If you remembered spending countless hours in the arcade playing shooter classic like Raiden Series or Raiden Fighters then you will fall in love with this game. Its great 2D pixel-art is truly unique and really gives the game is own unique style. Each of the four ships that you can fly in the game plays different from each of the others and it will take you some time until you master each of them. Great game for the value!

												This is a solid traditional bullet-hell game, with a well balanced difficulty curve, good variation in maps, and a variety of ships with different strengths and weaknesses. Where it really shines though is in co-op. I really recommend the DLC extra ships, upping the available ships from 4 -> 7 gives a lot more choice and the extras play in ways that are quite different to the defaults.(Word of note; each player requires a different controller, You will not be able to play 3-4 player without extra mice, keyboards or gamepads)			",201,44,2,21,6,2,28

												Frantic, fun and challenging game, seems short with only 5 levels but the extra challenges, difficulties, and Gauntlet mode (which sees you doing all the levels in a row with the same amount of lives for 1 level) give it a lot of replay value. Can be punishingly difficult at times, not even on the hardest mode. DLC ships are worth the download, giving you more variety to tackle the stages you're stuck on. The music is brilliant too, really great for the frantic play of the game, and it matches what is going on on-screen too, giving every level a good rhythm that is learnable once learnt.

												Jamestown's story is quite unusual. Imagine the 17th century. The colonization of the New World and all that. This English colony is contested by the Spanish. Who are in league with the Martians. Because everything happens on Mars. And you, Sir Walter Raleigh, must stop them. With your spaceship. How crazy is that?The game itself is of the newly-formed 'bullet hell', a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up genre which emphasises on small Player Character hitboxes and dodging millions of bullets at a time.You can use any of four ships, associated with four historical characters, each with its secondary fire, and a Vaunt Mode, which can be activated after collecting enough gold from your enemies, and gives you a temporary shield which absorbs all bullets, a double damage boost and a double score boost. The difficulty scales up quickly, and the challenge levels add to it even more. In short, Jamestown is one explosive, manic, and hilarious game. Why not give it a try?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having just finished this, I felt I should go back and write a proper review. In short it's a bullet hell shooter. If you don't know what that is basically, the enemies fill the screen with bullets and you have to dodge them while trying to rack up a high score.The scoring system is simple but fun. When enemies die they drop gold which, when picked up, fills up your Vaunt meter. When your Vaunt meter is full you can press mouse 3 to activate Vaunt mode. In Vaunt mode a forcefield will appear around you for about 3 seconds that absorbs all bullets it comes into contact with. Your meter will slowly decrease but picking up gold will fill it up again. When Vaunt ends you get bonus points depending on how long you kept the combo going. If you die, it ends the combo and you get nothing.There's 4 person cooperative multiplayer but it's local only, which sucks.This game is challenging but rewarding and the soundtrack is spectacular. 100% recommended!

												Jamestown is a wonderful homage to the genre, up there with Locomalito's Hydorah, and features a setting that quickly became one of my favorites - a 17th century alternate history that repositions ""the New World"" in the literal sense, while avoiding steampunk cliches. The music is fantastic, reminding me of the best of PS1 era orchestration in games like Final Fantasy Tactics, the pixel art is pretty much spot on, though a bit messy-seeming in places, and I only wish I had some people here in front of my macbook to play 4P with.

The game itself is intuitive and easy to pick up and play, yet challenging in its own right. The game offers about five different levels of difficulty (plus Hardcore Mode), which will keep even the most skilled players busy for awhile. Add to that an interesting and well written story, and throw in one of the best soundtracks in gaming and you've got yourself a no-brainer. It's the greatest SNES shoot-em-up never made!

												This is a game were you have to find patterns in the shots being fired at you from the enemy. It has epic music that gets your blood going and action that doesn't stop until the end. It can be a difficult game to get down, but with practice you will understand how to move between the bullets to beat each level. The levels are alot different with a variety of enemy's to shoot and blow up. There is alot to this game with bonus levels and ""Gauntlet"" mode were you have to beat the game in one sitting and without loosing your cool. There are 4 ships to choose from that really have different style of play.There is a co-op mode were you can play with friends, but not online with other people. The game has old school graphics but new school gameplay. I recommend picking this one up when it ever becomes available at a price that suits you. Its a great casual game that can be very hard to put down.			",3038,1134,139,314,429,33,476

												Jamestown's story is quite unusual. Imagine the 17th century. The colonization of the New World and all that. This English colony is contested by the Spanish. Who are in league with the Martians. Because everything happens on Mars. And you, Sir Walter Raleigh, must stop them. With your spaceship. How crazy is that?The game itself is of the newly-formed 'bullet hell', a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up genre which emphasises on small Player Character hitboxes and dodging millions of bullets at a time.You can use any of four ships, associated with four historical characters, each with its secondary fire, and a Vaunt Mode, which can be activated after collecting enough gold from your enemies, and gives you a temporary shield which absorbs all bullets, a double damage boost and a double score boost. The difficulty scales up quickly, and the challenge levels add to it even more. In short, Jamestown is one explosive, manic, and hilarious game. Why not give it a try?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A wonderful yet short danmaku [bullet hell] with a beautiful and grand soundtrack. Controls are simple enough, and it's certainly easy to pick up and play in short bursts. There are only four ships available, and three of those you'd have to purchase with the money acquired from getting a good score. DLC adds three new ships, but doesn't add any more maps, so there's that. Possible four player local co-op is incredibly hectic, and if you don't have all the necessary gamepads there's still the keyboard option. But sharing that while starting at the screen would be a bit troublesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful graphics, strategic shooting and level design fine tuned into a humming machine of death. Did I mention the amazing soundtrack that you'll have humming in your head all day long?  *Essential* purchase for shooter fans, and fans of indie games and action games in general will find lots of enjoy.I've been loving the solo game, and apparently the multiplayer is even better, taking inspiration from the mechanics of Guitar Hero and others. Game of the Year for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jamestown is a top-down arcade-style space shooter like Raiden or Galaga with very beautiful 16-bit-style pixel art and very fun, modern gameplay.I normally really enjoy these sorts of games, and not suprsingly, I enjoyed this one too. Lots of enemies, lots of bullets, and the controls are good enough that you can deal with both. There are five difficulty settings and interesting bonus levels that increase replay value. But, what really made the game fun was the multiplayer.  You can play locally with up to four players, using mouse, keyboard, or gamepads. I hadn't played a good local multiplayer game in a while, and this was a blast with three. There are four different ship types, so people can take on multiple roles in a group. Best to stick with the easiest type if you're going solo, though.I just got it on sale, and it's already been worth the money for me. If you like this sort of game, then I think you'll enjoy this one too.			",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

												Jamestown taps into a part of my brain I thought long-dormant, if not dead entirely. I regressed to the age of arcades and all-nighters, of sugar highs and high-score triumphs. I experienced honest-to-goodness GLEE from a combo. I could ramble on about the delightful graphics, stellar music, and all those quantifiable things, but that'd take valuable time away from blowing up Conquistador-allied Martian battlebots. So, just trust me on this one.			",85,43,1,29,9,0,34

												A good introduction to bullet hell. Or rather, it was my introduction and I've enjoyed it. The game looks and sounds very good, and has a pretty slick arcade-y interface as a whole. There's only 5 levels, the idea is you replay them on increasing difficulty levels and it works for me. 3 of the 4 available planes feel good and provide fresh gameplay, and the bullet-eating vaunt powerup system is a lot of fun to use. There's a nice difficulty curve from kinda hectic on ""normal"", to wtf crazy on ""divine,"" and then the highest difficulty, ""judgement,"" just kicks out your crutches and reminds you why its called bullet hell.Oh, and there's multiplayer, but as of yet it's local only, so who knows how that is. They said they'd put netplay in if there was demand, but at the time of writing there's certainly demand but no mention from the devs of working on it. The game can stand on its single player, but netplay would be nice.			",327,52,7,27,14,2,30

												It's a very well done bullet hell, shoot em up game. Easy to pick up, hard to master. There is a vaunt mechanic that provides a temporary relief, and different ships with different abilities so there is a degree of strategy as well while playing. It also has a local multiplayer and can use either the mouse or keyboard so you can easily get 4 people playing on the same computer.  It is challenging and really fun to play with friends so it's definitely worth it. The DLC adds new ships, but my fav is one that comes standard. I haven't tried the hardest difficuly, but I hear that it ramps up the difficulty considerably, so there will always be something to draw your attention.			",264,52,5,16,12,0,20

												This game. Freaking love it. The sound track is great let me first say that. This is a classic top down shooter.You get ship upgrades,boss fights,power ups (each ship comes with a unique power up),unlockable ships, and a world map. The world map has other levels you can unlock to play by getting enough points and reaching certain goals to unlock the bonus material that does not detract from the main campaign at all and serves as a reward for your hard work at accepting th various challenges needed to unlock them.If your a shooter fan, do not miss this. The expansion pack just adds some new ships nothing more so you can skip it and you wont feel like your missing anything.You can get it and the expansion and enjoy its new ship goodness,choice is yours.

												If you can get your friends to LAN at your house, this is probably one of the most fun shoot-em-ups to get.  Keyboards/360 controllers make this game a blast when playing with friends around a tv hooked up to a computer.  It still get's ridiculously hard on some of the challenges and on the later levels.  This game is meant for introducing people to this genre, which is really neat.  The levels are really short though (3-5 minutes max, besides the final level), there's 5 difficulties per level and a handful of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ challenges that will drive your sanity into the dark retches of space due to some of the requirements.GOOD GAME IMO			",380,70,3,37,17,3,34

												If you are a fan of the bullet hell style shooters such as the Touhou series or the Gundemonium games, then James town is the perfect game for you. I actually like the fact that the final level can only be played on the highest challenge option, it makes things that much more interesting.Then there's the array of Challenge maps that can be played aside from the story it's self. One of the biggest bonuses this game has over others in this same genre is that it supports up to 4 person multi-player. While the graphics are simple they're still visually captivating and hearken back to the SNES days with a 16-bit reminiscent style.  The music is well picked and along with the graphics provide the right atmosphere for this game. I say if you like bullet hell style shooters play this game, and I feel this is also a good place for people new this type of game to start with it's progressing difficulty that allows you to work up to final boss.

So, please buy this game.			",121,21,2,7,10,3,8

												Great bullet-hell sh'mup with outstanding 32bit pixel art graphics.  Difficulty isn't outrageous but it will certainly push you eye/hand coordination to their limits.  Lots of bonus challenge missions keep things fun after you finish the main story and multiple ships with different abilities encourage repeats on the story missions.  If you got ninja-like reflexes the higher difficulties will have you cursing at the gods.  Only big downside for me was I wished there was 1 or 2 more story stages to give it just a tad more bulk.  Otherwise, more than worthy purchase.			",202,84,2,18,11,3,27

												This game. Freaking love it. The sound track is great let me first say that. This is a classic top down shooter.You get ship upgrades,boss fights,power ups (each ship comes with a unique power up),unlockable ships, and a world map. The world map has other levels you can unlock to play by getting enough points and reaching certain goals to unlock the bonus material that does not detract from the main campaign at all and serves as a reward for your hard work at accepting th various challenges needed to unlock them.If your a shooter fan, do not miss this. The expansion pack just adds some new ships nothing more so you can skip it and you wont feel like your missing anything.You can get it and the expansion and enjoy its new ship goodness,choice is yours.

												If you can get your friends to LAN at your house, this is probably one of the most fun shoot-em-ups to get.  Keyboards/360 controllers make this game a blast when playing with friends around a tv hooked up to a computer.  It still get's ridiculously hard on some of the challenges and on the later levels.  This game is meant for introducing people to this genre, which is really neat.  The levels are really short though (3-5 minutes max, besides the final level), there's 5 difficulties per level and a handful of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ challenges that will drive your sanity into the dark retches of space due to some of the requirements.GOOD GAME IMO			",380,70,3,37,17,3,34

												It's a bullet hell game like those good o'll clasic arcade games you all know about. The ""Vault"" system gives you some strategy in getting more points and a small few seconds of bullet invunerablility. To progress it makes you complete the other levels at higher dificulties to unlock the next chapters, that combined with challenge stages gives this quite a long stretch. I'd say give it a go if these types of games interest you.			",568,98,7,62,21,0,41

												If you are a fan of the bullet hell style shooters such as the Touhou series or the Gundemonium games, then James town is the perfect game for you. I actually like the fact that the final level can only be played on the highest challenge option, it makes things that much more interesting.Then there's the array of Challenge maps that can be played aside from the story it's self. One of the biggest bonuses this game has over others in this same genre is that it supports up to 4 person multi-player. While the graphics are simple they're still visually captivating and hearken back to the SNES days with a 16-bit reminiscent style.  The music is well picked and along with the graphics provide the right atmosphere for this game. I say if you like bullet hell style shooters play this game, and I feel this is also a good place for people new this type of game to start with it's progressing difficulty that allows you to work up to final boss.

												Between the large numbers of FPS games, and the RPGs, Bullet Hell shooters are sadly under-represented on Steam, and in fact, in Western gaming in general.Jamestown is one such example of a Bullet Hell shooter. It gives you a variety of ships that you can use to pummel through a variety of enemies, while at the same time trying to avoid getting pummeled yourself. It's very lenient on lives, and the levels are short, so if you can get used to levels one at a time it's not a particularly difficult bullet hell, but it serves its purpose well and is highly recommended if you're a fan of scrolling shooter type games, or perhaps are looking for something in a genre you have not had any chance to play yet.It's very inexpensive, so worth a buy.

												If you're completely mad for bullet hell-style games then this game is definitely for you, so stop reading here, but as a big casual myself i really didn't enjoy it. The shooting generally feels really light and unsatisfying with anemic sound effects, and the three extra ships you can buy are less fun to use than the one you start with. Moreover, the game as of Jan. 2016 is bugged, with all enemy projectiles displayed as grey, which makes the game needlessly hard-- you can fix it by opting in to the Beta version, but who knows what you're missing out on there. The music and the setting are unique and carefully done, but TOO carefully done i think-- i'd rather play a game where the game makers' time was all spent on rock-solid mechanics at the expense of the story than the opposite, and this is the opposite in my own opinion. You really need to have your ducks in a row to spend that much time developing the stylistic elements, but it's not a good enough shooter to get away with it so the whole martian-colonialism thing just ends up being distracting/pointless as you die for the 3000th time to a bullet you couldn't see coming (for a shooter that gets it right see 'Sine Mora', which gets away with its elaborate narrative elements in spades, though admittedly the Arcade mode is pointlessly difficult and rage-inducing). So yeah, as a non-superfan of the genre, i really didn't enjoy this-- it's too bugged and hard and viscerally lacking. I'd dock it further points for having an Infuriatingly Annoying Indoor Level, but then pretty much every shooter has one of those...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In many ways, this is a baby's first bullet hell game.  It's a bullet hell shoot em up that is relatively easy to start, giving you a way to soak up lots of damage and increase your weapons without taking a hit, and it has several different types of ships and weapons for different play styles.  This game's graphics are just gorgeous, from the wonderfully alien martians and monstrous enemies you fight in search of roanoke, to the steam punk ships and bosses.  It's a beautiful amalgam of sprites and pixel art.  What surprised me most is the sound track, honestly.  It's soul stirring in places, particularly the final boss.  I was getting a Final Fantasy 7, Sephiroth vibe of it.  And the difficulty sliders make the game more akin to a true bullet hell the harder you go, so there's something here for all ages, especially with the challenge maps.  Frustratingly, the game only gives you a set number of lives in single player...I wish they gave you one ups based on your score.  That would have made this game perfect.  Otherwise, this is a super fun shmup that anyone can get into.			",73,23,0,18,2,0,9

												Jamestown is just a really great game all around. I am surprised it is Final Form Games's first game; what a debut. It's a vertically-scrolling bullet hell shoot-em-up with a well-presented story, which is about the first colony Jamestown, and it has conquistadors and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Except this Jamestown is on Mars! You play as Sir Walter Raleigh on a spaceship, and what you do is fire all sorts of lasers at all those Spanish Martian ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. There are 4 ships to choose from, with 3 more from a downloadable expansion, and each ship has 2 firing modes. One of my favorite things about this game is local co-op of up two 4 players, all on one computer! You can have one person on mouse, one on keyboard, one on joystick, and one on gamepad, or whatever other alternative input devices. I like the overall feel of this game and the pixelly artstyle and the menus and the music is really outstanding too. There's also a bunch of different difficulties to play on, and bonus levels and lots of  unlockables.			",1323,459,35,180,136,12,186

												Bullet hell is an understatement. Prepare to have 1000 things on the screen at once all trying to kill you. Its amazing! The controls are tight and every death feels a mistake on the player, not an unfair circumstance. In order to beat the story mode you will have to be able to beat all of the levels of legendary, but the game offers even higher difficulties and challenge modes that will make you cry blood with frustration. The replayability is fantastic.This game is beautiful. The graphics are nostalgic and the artwork does a good job of establishing its own style. The sound is also really good, I found myself getting caught up in the music while playing, it fits the scenario really well.If the gameplay looks appealing to you, then this game is a must buy, very well executed and very fun to play!

It's a solid challenge and everything is done right. 8 possible ships to choose from, the soundtrack is AMAZING by itself, the pixel art is great. Everything.  5 levels with 5 modes of difficulty, a gauntlet mode, challenge levels. There is enough content here that will keep you busy for a while. It's an added bonus that the achievements list has some achievements that really make you work for it. Definitely belongs in your library. Hell, it belongs...in your heart.Oh, and you can play with 3 others too with local co-op, if that is what you are into. You have spent too long reading this and not playing it. Go buy it.

												This is a brilliantly designed and produced top-down shooter. The retro graphics and soundtrack is charming, the plot melds Victorian-era events with sci-fi and steam punk. The combination makes for a really intriguing mix.This is a skill-based game and the tight controls and unique ship designs/weapon systems will give you countless hours of enjoyment and frustration. If you die, it's probably your fault. Thankfully, the learning curve is handled well i.e. you can't try more difficult levels until you've managed to beat the previous levels at a certain difficulty.This is a relatively short game depending on how good you are able to master the ships and become one with the controls. I find myself favoring the game pad though a keyboard + mouse also works well. Multi-player coop is also quite fun.The charm of this game is that it can also be played in small doses. There was a time that I couldn't beat the final boss. For several nights I try to finish the game to no avail. But after a while, I got the hang of it and managed to kill the boss. This is the point where I realized that all that time, the game was training me to get better and better.			",201,95,0,49,13,0,53

Just pick a ship you like and start griding away at levels and bosses until you can perfect them, and watch the hours pile up.

Only drawback is that there are only 5 levels, but it's okay since each one is very well-designed.

												This is a great little shooter. My only gripe is that 4 levels in it tells you that you must replay the game on hard mode, not normal, to access the other levels. That's a bit lame as it's a story/campaign so we are 4 levels in and now have to replay them again.It's still a... blast. ;)Buy it.			",128,23,1,9,11,0,11

												A really nice Bullet Hell game, it requires much concentration from the player to evade every single projectile, but on the low levels can be a good casual game.+Its difficulties really increase since the lower difficulty (Easy) to the highest difficulty (Judgement), making him a balanced game, even for those who want a casual game and even for those who want a really challenger game.+It has a unique style of graphic and level design, making use of the Cyberpunk Style and in futurists features too;+Has 4 (four) types of airships, everyone of them having your unique mechanics and gameplay, making the player choose between one of them for better skills and having a better playthrough.-It has a little number of stages;-If you play for a long time in and high difficulty, it can make you eyeballs hurt a bit duo to the high level of bright particles;-Could have a Airship Customization feature, so the player can make his own combos in his airship.

The game itself is also very good, with plenty of replay value. It is best played with a gamepad or keyboard, but you can insert up to 4 keyboards/mice/gamepads for cooperative play. 9/10, all this game needs is online multiplayer to be astounding in every aspect.

												Pretty neat game with nice graphics and awesome music. It plays really smoothly, but some things can be unclear during the final stages.

												A definate throwback to all of those games where your in a ship and need to kill EVERYTHING. There are only five levels, and the whole ""story"" only takes 20 minutes top. However, there is a slew of extra levels, challenges, ships and other things to do. You can use your special ability a lot, which is actually very nice for such a difficult game. The real game in here lies in the local multiplayer.  It's so much fun to blast aliens with friends, and the game gets super intense with things flying everywhere. Easily worh the 10 dollars.

It's a solid challenge and everything is done right. 8 possible ships to choose from, the soundtrack is AMAZING by itself, the pixel art is great. Everything.  5 levels with 5 modes of difficulty, a gauntlet mode, challenge levels. There is enough content here that will keep you busy for a while. It's an added bonus that the achievements list has some achievements that really make you work for it. Definitely belongs in your library. Hell, it belongs...in your heart.Oh, and you can play with 3 others too with local co-op, if that is what you are into. You have spent too long reading this and not playing it. Go buy it.

												This is a brilliantly designed and produced top-down shooter. The retro graphics and soundtrack is charming, the plot melds Victorian-era events with sci-fi and steam punk. The combination makes for a really intriguing mix.This is a skill-based game and the tight controls and unique ship designs/weapon systems will give you countless hours of enjoyment and frustration. If you die, it's probably your fault. Thankfully, the learning curve is handled well i.e. you can't try more difficult levels until you've managed to beat the previous levels at a certain difficulty.This is a relatively short game depending on how good you are able to master the ships and become one with the controls. I find myself favoring the game pad though a keyboard + mouse also works well. Multi-player coop is also quite fun.The charm of this game is that it can also be played in small doses. There was a time that I couldn't beat the final boss. For several nights I try to finish the game to no avail. But after a while, I got the hang of it and managed to kill the boss. This is the point where I realized that all that time, the game was training me to get better and better.			",201,95,0,49,13,0,53

												I'm not great at shmups, but, for maybe the first time in the genre, that wasn't a prequisite for enjoying Jamestown. Perhaps even more unlikely was that a good portion of my enjoyment was due to a shmup's story: Jamestown combines colonial American history with spaceships, Mars, and aliens, then revels in the goofiness of it all. The result, thankfully, isn't B-movie schlock, but rather a charming, cartoonish world where I can feel at home shooting a ton of things and (mostly) avoiding a never-ending stream of bullets. And to that end, Jamestown is also extremely solid. The campaign is a fairly short experience, but there is a real draw to mastering levels on multiple difficulties and -- if you're skillful enough (I wasn't) -- working your way through the myriad one-life, scenario-driven challenge levels.

												A lovably orginal take on bullet hell. Wide variety of difficulties and ships that's sure to bring in people of all skill levels. Works well as both a frantic multiplayer experience and a knuckle grinding single player gauntlet. Just pick a ship you like and start griding away at levels and bosses until you can perfect them, and watch the hours pile up. Also has an amazing score and eye-catching pixel art that perfectly caputres the off-kilter historical themes. Highly reccommended.			",111,34,2,15,6,0,9

												It’s 1619, you’re a guy named Raleigh who’s been busted for your nefarious ways and sentenced to death by the King of England.  You’re not ready to go out like that though; you still have a lot of life in you.  So, you set out for the colonies to make a name for yourself by doing something heroic to put yourself back in the king’s favor.  You set your sights on the lost colony of Roanoke where surely you can become a hero in the war against the Spanish and nab yourself a reprieve on that execution thing.  Except…the colonies, they’re on Mars.  And the Spanish, they fight alongside the Martian Overlords.  And you, you’re going to take them all on with your retro-futuristic wooden sky jet-ski armed with lasers! I know, it sounds nutty right?  It certainly is.  The story plays directly to fans of science fiction though, especially if you’re a fan of things such as “John Carter of Mars”.   Thankfully, this shoot-em-up packs in plenty of action to spice things up and screens full of bullet hell that will keep you on your toes.  The controls are tight enough to make these moments of on screen chaos manageable.   There are times where Jamestown feels like it might be a bit of an easy mode for the classic shmup fan; Raleigh’s hitbox is very tiny and you’ll find yourself getting away with moves that you know shouldn’t be able to.  The game still manages to be a great time though and the story is so far out there, it feels worth pushing through the levels just to find out where they’re going with Sir Raleigh of Mars.

It's a vertically-scrolling bullet hell shoot-em-up with a well-presented story, which is about the first colony Jamestown, and it has conquistadors and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Except this Jamestown is on Mars! You play as Sir Walter Raleigh on a spaceship, and what you do is fire all sorts of lasers at all those Spanish Martian ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. There are 4 ships to choose from, with 3 more from a downloadable expansion, and each ship has 2 firing modes. One of my favorite things about this game is local co-op of up two 4 players, all on one computer! You can have one person on mouse, one on keyboard, one on joystick, and one on gamepad, or whatever other alternative input devices. I like the overall feel of this game and the pixelly artstyle and the menus and the music is really outstanding too. There's also a bunch of different difficulties to play on, and bonus levels and lots of  unlockables.			",1323,459,35,180,136,12,186

												It's a bullet hell. You know it's going to be hard.  But it has some other things going for it.The first couple of difficulty levels will be relatively easier, but it feels more to get played accustomed and prepared for the later difficulties in the game.  It will roll you into the gameplay as to prepare you for harder tasks at later diffficulties.  This will be necessary because later levels will have to be played at harder difficulties, so progression requires harder trials.There is also the fact that you have different ships providing different kind of firepower at you disposal, providing a varying form of gameplay every time you start up a level.  There is also a gauntlet mode later into the game that will provide yourself some replayablity after you beat the levels.However, there is only a local co-op that can support up to 4 players on keyboard, mouse, or controller, and there is a lack of an online multiplayer.  The plot is nothing too intriguing, but it is not a major flaw due to genre.  This game would be put up high on my list of bullet hells, next to Shienryu.			",257,47,1,28,32,4,36

												Excellent game.Old-School bullet hell shoot-'em'up.AMAZING soundtrack.Its odd ""Colonial America on Mars"" aesthetic grows on you.Could be a little longer, but at this price point, length is probably about right.Definitely worth the $2.49 I paid on sale and if you like shmups (and somehow haven't played this yet) probably worth buying at $4.99			",294,63,2,46,31,4,56

												This game is amazing--and the best part of it is the soundtrack. Francisco Cerda did AMAZING with the soundtrack, I can do nothing but recommend it. The game itself is also very good, with plenty of replay value. It is best played with a gamepad or keyboard, but you can insert up to 4 keyboards/mice/gamepads for cooperative play. 9/10, all this game needs is online multiplayer to be astounding in every aspect.

												Pretty neat game with nice graphics and awesome music. It plays really smoothly, but some things can be unclear during the final stages. While it has Challenges and Side Missions, the main game is too short. I'm not too fond of the desicion they took to force players to replay stages in order to advance, too. In the end, though, this is a really fun game any fan of the Shoot'em Up genre would enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I play this game on my laptop to burn time. it is xbox 360 controller capable and the quality of the gameplay is a 7/10.  Now on the other end, the story is nothing to great but for a game that costs under five dollars, your probably not gonna get both.  It is a 2d plane shooter to put it at best.  reminiscint of many oler games with great twist and technical improvements.  If I was an editor, this would recieve an editors choice award.

												+ProsSolid shoot em upGreat difficulty and challenges to faceNice variety of shipsGreat enemies and bossesGreat multiplayer and controller support-ConsReplay levels not because you want to but because you have to in order to unlock the later levelsVery short level-wiseBottom LineI really like this game but my main and only gripe is the way it forces you to replay levels. You have to beat all levels on a hard difficulty to unlock the next. Then you have to beat all the unlocked levels on an even harder difficulty to unlock the next and so on. It's padding but once you get to the end, it's smooth sailing by then.If you want, just play the whole thing from the getgo on the hardest difficulty... no big deal...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Does a great job of invoking the spirit of the arcade shooters its influenced by. A little short but it does have replayability in that you can redo levels on a number of difficulties and with different ships. If you're the type of person who hunts for high scores or perfect runs you'll definitely get some mileage out of it. The games only flaw is that its co-op is local only.			",350,83,9,28,13,3,30

												An interesting title with an awesome pixel art style and a music fitting it. The theme is rididulous but it just makes the game more interesting. Pity the story is sort of average from what I've played. As far as the cutscenes art go, not really my style, but I'm guessing it was an attempt at creating something fitting the story.It isn't as extreme as Ikaruga, which is a plus for me since I can't play on that level. However this game brings out a lot of interesting mechanics I've never seen from the few titles I've played from the genre. You get different ship models each with an interesting superpower which just further engages you without getting to ridiculous missile spam.Now the bad. The levels are short and you quickly get through half the story in about 20 mins. But then it orders you to play all three previous levels again in high difficulty in order to go through. This was a huge disapointment considering I hate replaying games. Overall I recommend it but be prepared to spend quite some time replaying it if you don't go straight Difficult Mode from the start.			",280,91,1,30,12,1,27

												This game was brought to my attention last summer by TotalBiscuit and his WTF Is series. After finally playing through it, I can happily report that this is one of my favorite games of late. I recommend checking out TB's video for an in-depth look at this title, and for a few good laughs at his reactions.Jamestown is sadly a rare event in modern gaming in that it is an inherently difficult game. Fans of the arcade era shmups will feel right at home with this design philosophy. New players to shmups will find an expertly designed and executed game, testing your gaming skills firmly but fairly.Online leaderboards are set up for all game modes, and this gives the game some nice replayability. Add to that varied plane types and play styles, and you can find lots to do with this game that is somewhat absent in voluminous content.Take some time out of being told how great you are with every other game out there and truly test yourself with Jamestown.

												This game is okay.  I'm sorta on the fence about not recommending it, even.  But basically I played it through once and I have no desire to do it again, and that's not good.  It's kiiiiiinda an okay shmup, I guess.  The art style and the music and story are interesting and well done.  But the ship design is just terrible, and shooting things isn't satisfying at all!  How do you ♥♥♥♥ that up?  Do you design a shmup without, like, PLAYING any shmups?  I mean, for Christ's sake, Dodonpachi had better ships and that came out like, what, 20 years ago?  Every ship type Jamestown tries to play with has been done way better in at least one other game already.  Or more like every other shmup out there.  The non-BGM sound design is just... eh.  It's so flat and dull and uninteresting.  Little pew pew noises and dumb, passionless explosions.Granted, it does some interesting things?  Like, people tell me it's better in multiplayer.  Like that means anything.  And it forces you to increase the difficulty or ... you're not allowed to play levels until you replay previous ones on higher ... settings?  Wait, that's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid!  No, no.  No more fence.  Screw this game.			",120,10,1,16,9,0,15

												This game was semi-interesting, a weird sort-of Steampunk/Alternate History story and it was really fun to get into. But, it quickly became so difficult that I found it unplayable. I'm sitting here swearing at my computer, dying from bullets I couldn't see... wondering what is fun about moving to the furthest area of the screen and wiggling back and forth between endless waves of colorful orbs. I really expected it to be better.Unless you need to prove to somebody that you're ""hardcore"" don't bother.			",4,0,0,1,2,0,0

 4/5. GREAT GAME !  OVERALL This game is super fun and has a nice learning curve, starting with a rather easy shoot 'em up first level and ending with a fifth bullet hell level and one of the hardest and most frustrating end bosses I had encountered, it reminded me to the SNES era, very painful and yet so satisfying once you finally defeat him. It took me around 6h to finish the game, of which 2h were just to clear the final stage... don't judge me. In the end $10 might be a pretty fair price but if you are doubting if you'll like it then wait for a discount and then get it, preparing yourself for the great deed you will have to face to beat this game. REPLAYABILITY The game has various difficulty although if you want to finish it you need to at least complete the final level on Legendary, then you have 2 other difficulties if you are wicked good or really masochist. You also have up to 8 different ships (with the Deluxe Pack) and Gauntlet Mode which allows you to play all the stages with nothing but the 2 credits you get by normally playing a single stage (each credit allows you to endure up to 3 hits). In the end there's plenty to do if you so desire.  GAMEPLAY I played it with my Xbox 360 controller and it played great, using only the left stick and 3 buttons of my controller gave me that classic arcade feel and was really enjoyable, it's pretty easy and fun to play the first 3 levels on normal using the different ships and seeing which is your favorite, then it gets more tricky when you are forced to play on higher difficulties to keep unlocking more stages, however this is for training purposes and it was a design choice by the developer. Regarding that choice I feel it's not ideal for less skillful players such as myself, in the end I did get better and managed to beat the game after a lot of effort though. AESTHETIC I love the look of this game, it's classic arcade shoot' em up visuals and I felt right at home from the times of my childhood and teen years, this games is beautiful to look at and pretty varied with stages that vary quite a lot with a big portfolio of creatures who will attack you in different ways. STORY The story is completely absurd, and it's sorry it's not sorry, you can purchase an alternate script that's even more childish and might give you a little smirk (Plot included on the Deluxe Pack), it's a pretty wild and crazy story that might intend to make fun of other games stories since in the end people play shoot 'em ups to, well, SHOOT F*ing THINGS UP!   MUSIC Now this is an area where this game truly shines, I absolutely loved this game's score, kudos to the composer who just nails it in the head with the epic soundtrack, I still hum the final boss' song in my head when I think about this game (mainly because I suffered that freaking boss a loooot of times).

												6/10 on this game, maybe a bit more however only if priced for under $2.50 as the game mechanic is to have you only access level 4 after beating 1-3 on hard, level 5 access is only after beating level 1-4 on legendary... I'm stuck on level 2 legendary and have been for a few days. With no way to ""buy"" extra lives in the in game market place which would allow you to get to the end of game after grinding, this title is being deleted after a few hours. Again, good fun top down contra style action, with one weapon per ship mind you, 6/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I’m not a die hard fan of the shootem’ up genre, I do have a fondness for well implemented ones. Ones like Sine Mora had me sinking countless frustrating hours in them but Jamestown was just a bit too much.It’s one thing to have a lot of bullets on screen, that’s kind of the point of the genre, but Jamestown takes this to a very unappealing level by blowing up the size of everything by 100 fold. There were times that during a boss fight I could not even see the background art through all the projectiles. Mechanically this is addressed by making the hitboxes not necessarily like up with the actual art assets, but that does nothing to mitigate the fact that instead of feeling chaotically, mercilessly difficult, Jamestown just ends up feeling hopeless and not worth putting the effort into.

												Jamestown is a western styled shmup that is a cakewalk for the veterans of the genre but acts as a great game to break in newbies to these style of games. There are various challenge modes to unlock via the token system. The challenges range from flying through checkpoints to staying alive as long as possible and offers quite a variety of things to do if you’re bored trying to hit high scores in the campaign. These tokens are also used to unlock various ships to add spice to your gameplay. Jamestown even includes a local multiplayer mode that allows 4 players through additional controller peripherals. The style is surprisingly unique and creative for a genre that was beaten to death by the Japanese for years. Sadly Jamestown has major flaws that makes it less impressive to the shmup elitists. Jamestown bullet patterns are very predictable and lacks variety. Bosses while visually appealing, don’t really carry the super difficulty expected from bosses in hardcore shmups.

												It's a casual (very) shmup, that is okay-ish entry if you are new to the genre, more so if you have a friend avaible for LOCAL co-op, the game doesn't have any form of online play. For more experienced shmup players, I'd recommend passing on this one, if nothing else, you will propably get bad habits from it.The game has it's moments, especially in co-op, but that's about it. Entertainment for a couple hours.Compared to many other shmups avaible, the game doesn't bring anything to the table. The stage design, not to mention the extremely simple and dull boss fights is a big turn off, especially the final stage is flat out horribly designed because ""It's the last stage, we must make it totally different and stupid"", it feels extremely out of place.Difficulty wise, if you are looking for a challenge, you won't find it until unlocking the ""Judgement"" difficulty.  There's a huge ""false difficulty"" ramp in the game when starting, simply because the background has alot of distracting factors in it, after you get used to the art style, the game is a cakewalk if you have ever played any other shmups. A few of the challenge missions were rather fun, altho not that difficult when you get the idea for each one.			",189,25,1,35,10,0,9

												Jamestown is one of the strongest 'against-the-flow' feelings i've had against a game; here is this clearly beautifully crafted thing that for some reason i can't enjoy or appreciate. Everyone says it's great, the reviews do too--so why don't i like it?Jamestown is, in my mind, not a schmup designed to be a schmup. The rudimentary gameplay is not interesting or challenging enough to sustain prolonged interest, the enemy types are forgettable, the stages are bland and mono-paced, and the same song plays for every level, minus the last--an unforgiveable sin, to my mind, in this genre where ZUN and so many others have set such a precedent and high standard of quality for soundtrack composition. Everyone says this soundtrack is great, and i disagree--it is orchestral, emotionaless, unintuitive, and not at all designed around the experience of FLYING A SHIP SHOOTING STUFF. At the end of the day, Jamestown feels like an experience not designed around itself--the fluff is what makes the gameplay, but the fluff is stupid (no, it's /really/ stupid), and i don't like it and you can't make me like it, and therefore the game doesn't hold much weight by itself. The 'Vaunt' system is kind of cool, but ZUN's done better in every Touhou from 8 onward, so that's not much to brag about.Anyway. If you think there's a chance you'd enjoy a mediocre shooting experience with an impersonal movie soundtrack and terrible writing, buy Jamestown. i feel i was tricked. this review is brutally honest. i apologize for anyone's feelings that it hurts.

												While the artwork and game setting are very well thought out and portrayed, the longevity of Jamestown is its downfall. There are five campaign levels that must be beaten in Legendary difficulty in order for the player to advance. This difficulty level is appropriate for the first four levels, but on the fifth and final level, this design choice becomes a problem and a hindrance. The last level is so difficult, I consider it to be poorly designed and most importantly, inadequate. It is as if the designers realized they did not have much of a game in their hands, and decided to make the final fifth level nearly unbeatable, in order to excuse the amount of time necessary to complete the campaign. Sure, there are bonus modes/levels to be unlocked, but they are merely side distractions, that do not provide the player with additional entertainment or value. Jamestown is simply too short, in addition to one of its five levels being extremely poor. To add to this insult, the developers have released an expensive DLC for an already overpriced base game, that adds very little. The limited amount of continues is also another bad design choice because of the terrible last level. In the end, the player is left with a clear understanding that the developers resorted to a cheap and unimaginative means of prolonging Jamestown's lifespan by making it artificially and unusually difficult in the last level. Through this, it is very quick to realize that this game does not involve much, and the developers should be ashamed of themselves for charging so much for so little content. There are innumerable amounts of games of this same genre that are incomparably better, and most are more than 20 years older. Jamestown is a prime example of independent developers taking advantage of the scene and overcharging consumers for content that is extremely scarce, poorly implemented, and quite limited. There is very little to do, very little to experience, and very little to enjoy. Jamestown can be beaten in less than one hour, and there are many other games that have a much better value than this. What a waste.Jamestown is mediocre.			",1296,339,61,143,147,16,197

												Jamestown: Legend Of The Lost Colony is a neo-classical top-down shooter for up to 4 players, set on 17th-century British Colonial Mars. It features all the intensity, depth, and lovingly handcrafted pixels of a classic arcade shooter, with a modern twist: deeply-integrated cooperative gameplay.Unlike most top-down shooters, which give multiple players a shared pool of lives or continues, Jamestown does something different. So long as any player survives, the team can be brought back from death. By giving every player the power to rescue their team from the jaws of destruction, Jamestown creates an exhilarating cooperative experience where everyone’s contribution truly matters. Win or lose, your team will do it together.			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

												Top down shooter that fails to bring much to the plate other than stylised graphics. The additional levels need to be unlocked by forcing the player to a harder difficulty which doesn't suit many gamers outside of the elite few who can turn them selves into super players of any game. The additional ships can be bought for credits in game yet seem to be less powerful and more cumbersome than helpful. The game has charm and little else... i honestly think only big fans of shooters that have a lot of time to ignore faults will love this game. mind you, if your the sort of person who likes something pretty and doesnt care if it delivers anything else, this might be the game for you.

												Jamestown relies quite a bit on playing the same things over and over and over again at different difficulties. I love bullet hell and I would play one any day, but only because different levels have different content. When you have to play level 1 on easy, then level 2 on easy, then level 1 on moderate, then level 2 on moderate, then level 3 on moderate, then level 1 on hard...			",125,16,1,17,9,0,22

												Good as a bullethell game, but I feel uncomfortable in the sugercoating and basterdization of events in history that are transferred unto a scifi setting.

												An extremely enjoyable bullet hell game with features such as:4 player coop with additional mice, keyboards and gamepads (and an easy controls setup)5 Chapters/Levels with up to 5 difficulties for varying degrees of skill4 (7 with the DLC) different ships with very unique playstylesBonus Levels with varying objectives (also support 1-4 players)The pixel art may not be to everyone's liking but I liked its distinctive direction for gameplay purposes and story scenes.Bonus Levels, Ships and additional content such as gamemodes are tied in with a nice and steady progression system based on coins you get when finishing levels (the higher the difficulty, the more coins).It's a lot of fun with friends yet still addicting playing it solo.Jamestown was my first entry into bullet hell territory; the learning curve is nice and the gameplay simple yet hard to master. I definitely recommend Jamestown to anyone slightly interested in bullet hell games, you won't regret it (wait for a sale and get the DLC if you want the additional 3 ships, I enjoy them as much as vanilla ones).

												Jamestown was my gateway drug into the world of shmups (shoot 'em ups). It's greatest asset is not its gloriously rendered pixel graphics, unique art design, tight controls, solid gameplay mechanics, stellar cooperative play, excellent support for a number of control peripherals, or soundtrack of better quality than that of the best triple-A productions. What really makes this game one of the best of its kind is its ability to constantly encourage the player to improve their skill, avoiding frustrating difficulty cliffs, and creating a degree of replay value rarely seen in titles of any genre. The only gripe I have is the lack of online multiplayer, which is easily forgiven given the incredible quality of the whole package. There is no reason for anyone to pass this up. Do yourself the favor.			",367,68,10,25,15,0,22

												Jamestown is a shmup that's really worth getting.  My favorite is gauntlet mode, which is a decent approximation of a true arcade mode.  To get a grip on the scoring mechanics, try the score-based challenges and pay attention to what an enemy is doing when you destroy them and how it effects the bonus items (think of challenges more as scoring tutorials).There are multiple ships that really do play differently, and the levels have a lot of variety in them.  Four-player simultaneous play is an interesting bonus, but don't worry the game plays fine with just one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gameplay and controls of the game are very solid, with 4 strategies of dealing with each of the levels. This can be considered a ""bullet-hell"" shooter, based on how fast the difficulty increases as you progress through the game. Judgement, the hardest difficulty, is only for those who are experts of these kind of shooters. Very addictive, simple gameplay, with a story that does not get in the way, music that is very epic sounding, and set pieces and levels that look very well-done and retro feeling, this game is worth a look.

												Awesome 2d scrolling shooter/shmup. The art's pretty good and the old west theme works well. If you haven't heard of bullet hell or danmaku games, here's a good game to get acquainted with the genre. The basic premise is there's lots of bullets on screen and your ship's hitbox is a small circle in the center, which allows you to squeeze through bullet patterns. The scoring system is based on item collection chaining.You have 4 ships to select from, with different main and special weapons. In addition, you have a ""Vaunt"" ability, which gives you a temporary shield on use, and 2x strength and points until the meter runs out. You can keep the meter going by grabbing gold that enemies drop, and the longer you keep it going, the more points you get once it runs out. If you need to live a little longer, you can Vaunt again, giving another shield but a smaller bonus.There are 5 levels and 20 challenge levels, which makes the game perfect for both long sessions and quick bursts.

												I love the art style of this game.  The campaign itself is really short, only 6 missions. But there is a lot of additional stuff that can be done after you finish.  The Co-Op is a little misleading.  No, there is no online co-op. No, there is no LAN co-op. I was very disappointed by this because on Steam it says ""Local Co-Op"".  The only way this game can be played co-op is if someone is using the mouse, and the 2nd person is using the arrow keys. But even worse, it has 4-player co-op. Which means the 3rd person has to use WASD keys, and 4th person has to use a controller.  I think it's completely stupid the way they implemented co-op, even for an indie developer.This has no bearing on playing the game as a single player experience.  It was a solid fun gaming experience, and if you keep in mind to not be expecting anything more than a 1 - 2 hour story, then I suppose you should pick this game up.			",387,44,16,41,17,0,47

												Fun  vertical Shmup or ""Shoot em up"" with a historically interesting story. Although the game is very fun, I have a lot of problems with it. The game does not handle full screen well, and got to the point where the game would not load through steam because of it. I had to go to my program files to access the executable to change the settings, just so I can play the game through steam again. Also, the third mouse button uses your shield ability in game but for some reason it will not work for me, and it's pretty important for the last level. The biggest issue is that the developers are basically gone. No updates from them on their website or twitter in about a year. If the deveolpers were actually present to fix bug problems, this game would be worth it. Although not a must have, It is still a really fun game and such a shame that the deveolpers are basically gone.			",129,27,2,12,12,0,11

												I will be the third person on my list to recommend this game so far. :o This is a great vertical scrolling shoot-em-up, the screenshots and video of which look very punishing. What should be noted is that you have access to a shield which, when properly employed, means you can avoid the worst of the bullet-hell that defines games in this genre. Furthermore, it supports up to four-player co-op; but unfortunately it is only single-machine co-op. Perhaps in further instalments in this genre from this publisher we might see multi-machine co-op. :)			",580,214,21,96,41,6,125

For those who are really good at these kinds of games, there's many different difficulties and a ""Gauntlet"" mode where you get scored on all levels combined (like most games usually do) Highly recommended!

												A bullet-hell game. Normally, most people just hear the words and move away from anything related to the genre. But Jamestown is easily an exception to that instinctive behaviour.If you're old enough to remember those games where you had a plane or a ship flying on a vertically-scrolling background and tanks/turrets/monsters/something evil appeared and lobbed a red ball of death towards your vessel, Jamestown doesn't fall very far from that tree. What you need to know is that, much like most of those games, enemies spawn at the exact same place every time you run the exact same level (that is, the level itself associated with a difficulty). Unlike those games, however, you get the chance to select the difficulty.Jamestown is nice enough to players new to the bullet-hell genre by having multiple difficulties. ""How is that nice?"" you're thinking. The easiest difficulty is easy enough for someone that never played any game in his life to learn patterns, which in turn make them develop a sense of where to be and where not to be given the properties of the ship they're using. And each step in the difficulty curve is acceptable at the point where the player can reliably clear a level without dying more than once; it's a proof of skill from the player's part. That said, most people won't be able to clear all levels at the highest difficulty the game offers, and possibly not even the one before that. If you're in it for the ""100%"", you better be prepared to invest a good time of your life here.But achievement nuts aside, Jamestown is full of strong points. The controls are responsive as you'd expect a game of the genre, the music is like someone tossed you a thousand dollars and said ""keep it, no strings attached"", the visual style is undoubitably gorgeous. It even has an unusual backstory in a strange futuristic-pastlike-future for a game with no reason to have a story, if you care about those things. It also has a sort of ""challenge mode"" where you try to complete hard tasks in a preset course; think of it as this game's minigames. You have an activatable invulnerability shield on certain conditions as a base game mechanic related to scoring points. You also get to have four different ships to blast the baddies, each very different in gameplay from the others, so you can specialize in one that best suits you or try to master all of them for added replayability. And of course, you have a ""gauntlet mode"" where even reaching its end is like getting a free pat in the back and a bucket of your favourite drink.If you're looking for weak points, the only things that come to mind is the extra ships dlc (because you either love them and use them or end up sticking to only one or non-at-all since you already love one of the base game's ships) and the inherent what-you-see-is-what-you-get replayability that's associated with fixed levels and how high the skill barrier is for you. If you're a master of the bullet-hell genre, the hardest difficulty may be less challenging than you'd hope.Also, one can not stress this enough: the music of this game is amazing. The soundtrack's extra cost? If you play the game and like it, I recommend you buy it to hear it outside the game; supposedly the money goes to the composer, which needs to eat just like you.All in all, Jamestown is a great game. A solid 8 out of 10 easily, maybe even more. If you consider the game a little costy, wait for a discount; if the music is also at a discount, make sure you also buy it if you liked it in-game. As for the dlc ships, hit or miss: if you like the game, and want to say you like the people that put their heart making it, buy; otherwise my opinion is avoid unless at a good discount.

												An excellent vertical shoot 'em up in the style of old school shooters.The sprites and artwork for this game are top notch and the soundtrack is sublime. (Soundtrack also available for download).The game caters to the more novice shooter as well as the hardened bullet hell specialist with 5 difficulty levels.With 4 ships (8 if you get the expansion pack) to choose from there's an added sense of longevity too.Technically impressive and a fun game to boot. You can't go wrong with the price and it's a bargain for fans of the genre.			",63,0,1,2,0,0,5

The story is surprisingly interesting and the way it is presented draws upon similar feelings I have experienced reading or watching a classic epic. It really does a good job with what it has to offer without compromising the bottom line: The game is just fun to play and the replayability is surprisingly high.If you enjoy top-down shooters, especially in the bullet hell/panic shooter vein, this is a must-purchase.

												There aren't many bullet hell games on Steam or on the PC in general, but this one is a great inclusion in the genre. In general, bullet hell games can be impossibly frustrating right from the start, but with 5 different diffuculty settings, this game can really be picked up and enjoyed by players of all skill levels. Each step up in difficulty is not a huge leap, so its refreshing finding yourself finally challenging a level on a higher difficulty. That said, the single player campaign is incredibly short (as is the case with most shumps), but you'll find yourself coming back again and again trying to finally beat that last level or running through one of the challenge levels. It's a great pick up if you're a fan of shumps or if you can grab it on sale.			",745,212,16,112,55,5,140

												So you’ve never played a Bullet Hell shooter before and ‘Jamestown’ got your attention just because you’re a sucker for a nice alternative reality and/or Steampunk setting? Then let ‘Jamestown’ be your starter drug!It’s hard -- hell, it’s called “Bullet HELL” for a reason -- and you’ll curse many, many, many times, but you WILL [have to] get better progressing through the levels, and playing the first level again on one of the lower difficulties after beating the last level, you’ll somehow manage it without using all your credits. Who’d have thought?There are only five campaign levels, but its 20-odd bonus challenges [again, “challenges” for a reason] and, of course, the Gauntlet will test your skills to the fullest.Thanks to its retro-graphics and magnificent score, the game looks and sounds simply amazing. Beware though: Keyboard and mouse control are a bit odd. Gamepad recommended.			",2392,1046,103,328,352,37,440

												Pretty awesome flying shooter game.  I rarely play ""shumps"" but this one looked pretty cool and I was impressed.  Each level and ship is drastically different in style, graphics, and type of baddies.  My only gripe is that its short --- It took me 75 mins to beat the first 3 levels on normal, then the first 4 levels on difficult, then all 5 levels on legendary.  The game only has 5 levels, Just start on legendary since you cannot proceed further into the game unless you beat the earlier levels on legendary.  It appears to be a 4 player coop... I'd love to play it coop but I don't have anyone else that owns it.  It has roughly 6-7 difficulty levels so it can be replayed a lot.  It also has about 20 short challenge levels, roughly 60 seconds each.  Worth it at a discount.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the most amazingly polished indie games i've ever played. This is immediately noticeable if you're using a controller to navigate the menus. I was put off by the description of this game, but I ended up playing it anyways. It's a beautiful game from the story art, to the level graphics. The screenshots and videos do not do this game justice. There is a sort of mangled historically-warped story to the game that is also interesting. It's easy to play, giving you lots of deaths before you actually fail the level. Even when you fail, you still collect credits meaning you still inch your way towards buying a different ship. Much of the replay seems to be in forcing you to replay previous levels on a harder difficulty, but it's not so bad. My only gripe with the game is the lack of sound effects from enemies; they only play sounds when they take damage or die, never when they fire. It gives a sort of flat feeling to the gameplay.

												This game hits the nail on the head in so many departments you would be a damn fool not to invest the $10 for this game. The only complaint is that the final level becomes about 50x harder than the rest of the game. No problem, you won't mind going through it 10-15 times to beat the final boss. With 4 player local co-op on one computer, you have no reason to invite some friends over and play the hell out of this game, and considering it allows you to use as many mice, keyboards, and controllers as you want, it makes it extremely fun for the whole family to get involved. Buy it now and you won't regret it.			",569,115,25,61,31,6,84

At first I thought that it would be very difficult for me, but in this game the learning curve is perfectly made, and after a couple of hours of gameplay I was playing very hard difficult like nothing. The plot is good and interesting enough, and the pixel art is as good as the Japanese artist from the 16 bits era. Now the aspect that impresses me the most is the music, each track is an amazing master piece of “epicism” very uncommon in indie games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jamestown serves as both an excellent introduction to bullet hell shooters and a worthy challenge to veterans of the genre. Gameplay-wise, it accomplishes this by offering enough options (difficulty levels, ship types, and up to 4-player local co-op) to suit a wide range of players. Meanwhile, the excellent production values (gorgeous pixel art and bombastic orchestral soundtrack) make it a terrific, spotlight-worthy ambassador.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jamestown is a classic arcade vertical shooter, but with a feeling that's just impossible to describe. The story interjects between levels and feels like it came straight from the diary of a colonial American, if a colonial American were ever involved in a war against Martians; yeah, the story is strange.The game isn't bullet hell, but sometimes it feels close. There'll be plenty of moments leaving you tensing up as you swerve to dodge a volley of shots, and a lot of edge-of-your-seat boss battles. The music helps too; every track is listen-worthy outside the game and each song gets the heart racing-- a word to describe the music is ""Epic"".My only complaint is it's damned short. A shump veteran can finish Jamestown in one sitting. However for the price, it's worth it. And there's also challenge modes and multiplayer once you've saved the world in the story-proper.

												Jamestown is a good bullet-hell game if you like the genre and want a challenge. There are different scenes on a map that you have to defeat, and you have to defeat the previous scenes on harder difficulties consequtively to unlock the next areas. All the while, you gain gold which you use to buy content, such as new ships, different challenges, and different difficulties. Overall the game looks great and has the retro feel from the arcades of the 90's. Good western style adventure music, and lovecraftian-victorian-western settings and style really makes it an interseting twist. Bullet-hell, shooter with tentacles in the wild west of mars? Yes please!Make sure you're using a controller and not trying to use the keyboard. This game demands a joystick!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'd rather play Touhou, especially for the music and atomosphere, but you can't get those games in the West in an easy way yet. A great alternative!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll admit, I completely overlooked Jamestown at first. I can't remember why, but I'm sorry I did, and I thank Steam's christmas objectives for making me get it, because it's an amazing little game. The originality of it's premise (Sir Walter Raleigh and company ON MARS!) it's lovingly hand-drawn art and sprites, challenging gameplay and amazing soundtrack combine to create a truly excellent experience. In a time where so few games are even deserving to be called such rather then pointless wastes of time, boring grindfests or immersions in human aggression and stupidity, Jamestown invites you away from all that and takes you back on a wonderous, if brief journey to the golden age of gaming.

												This game is great on a variety of ways:+ Very responsive controls: runs fast on pretty much any rig nowadays @60 Hertz+ Very polished game: Both the tech and art managed to deliver an all around solid package. Major props for the small team+ Attractive visuals and music. The plot and campaign back story are nice additions+ Game is short but challenging. Offers a good range of difficulty levels. Divine mode is certainly nerve wrecking for most people but I personally find it manageable. Can't say the same about Judgement difficulty (the hardest setting).+ Co-op is pretty neat! A shame it is not online, though+ Overall bosses, enemies placement and design and bullet patterns are well distributed across the levels+ The final chapter is a very intriguing level. The boss fight feels great+ Bonus challenges are intriguing- Interesting ship concepts add a bit on the multiplayer field, but I don't find them very fun, really. Hence if you plan for mostly single player gaming, I do not recommend the DLC.I tapped out on the last difficulty setting (Judgement), which is quite brutal.Nonetheless, if you want to play an entry level bullet hell either solo or co-op, do play Jamestown! Also, if you are a seasoned player make sure you get to test your skills and scores on both Judgement difficulty and Gauntlet mode.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful Top-down space ship shooter, like the old R-type/Gradius/Lifeforce games.The video on the store page shows what gameplay is like at the harder difficulty settings.  At the lower levels the screen will not be full of laser spam like it is there, so don't worry.Story is like a western, but on Mars instead of the old west USA.  And instead of a horse you have a space ship, and instead of a six-shooter you have lazer cannons.Bizzare, but lots of fun.  Definitely worth it if you like these kinds of games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recently beat this game (all 5 stages offered) over the course of several hours. Being a big schmup fan, I could not resist purchasing this game when it was on a Steam sale. Having played quite a few schmup games (Gradius V, Raystorm/Crisis, Darius Burst, Ikaruga, Bug Princess, DonDonPachi), I went into this expecting a good time in bullet-hell.... but had gotten only about 60% of what I had expected. Was not ""blown-away,"" per say. The player hit-box did not appear to have issues, but the gameplay itself felt slightly lacking. Was a bit turned off at the fact that you have to ""unlock stages"" in a range of difficulties in order to play them. It felt like a cheap way to reduce the enemy/difficulty programming of the 5 stages.  The bosses also (even on harder difficulties) do feel a bit too easy to beat. 3.5 of 5 stars if you want to enjoy a decent schmup game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No exceptions.What at first seems like an ugly old top-down shooter with a weird name is probably one of the most well-done co-op titles I've ever played (and I've played a lot of them). It doesn't require gamepads and you can use pretty much anything as controller, so nobody needs to come prepared.As far as negative aspects go, the worst is probably the considerably limited campaign which a good team can finish in just a few hours.

												I love the art style of this game.  The campaign itself is really short, only 6 missions. But there is a lot of additional stuff that can be done after you finish.  The Co-Op is a little misleading.  No, there is no online co-op. No, there is no LAN co-op. I was very disappointed by this because on Steam it says ""Local Co-Op"".  The only way this game can be played co-op is if someone is using the mouse, and the 2nd person is using the arrow keys. But even worse, it has 4-player co-op. Which means the 3rd person has to use WASD keys, and 4th person has to use a controller.  I think it's completely stupid the way they implemented co-op, even for an indie developer.This has no bearing on playing the game as a single player experience.  It was a solid fun gaming experience, and if you keep in mind to not be expecting anything more than a 1 - 2 hour story, then I suppose you should pick this game up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't be turned off by the lack of amazing graphics or seemingly repetitive gameplay. The music is fantastic and the game has a lot of replay value due to the unlockable ships and difficulty levels. Although online co-op is lacking, having friends play next to you is still worth it. The story itself is short, but the message it carries across is touching. As for gameplay, it's challenging and fun, even if at times it can make you angry at the multitude of projectiles on the screen. It's well made and deserves a solid place in anyone's gaming library. In all, I recommend at least one playthrough, even if you aren't a fan of this genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jamestown is without a doubt one of the greatest shoot 'm ups that has been released in years. The game is very easy to learn, but the final levels and the challenge mode provide more than enough difficulty for the serious gamers. With the expansion it has only gotton better. The only thing missing is online co-op, but local it is close to perfect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't let my scant amount of time fool you. I've played this game a lot on the console version and I intend to as well with this one on Steam. There's a lot of Shmups here on Steam, a lot of damn fine ones. Some are bullet hell shooters that test your vision and agility, others are straight up fragfests that just allow a lot of fun and are kind of forgiving. This game falls somewhere in between, which is perhaps the best part about it.I've been playing Shmups since the Gradius/Lifeforce days on the NES or R-Type on the SMS so I'm well versed in them but seeing as how I'm 32 now, I'm nowhere near as skilled as I once was. This is one of the few I can remember that gets me as excited as those used to. It's got that amazingly attractive Metal Slug/Neo-Geo era arcade graphical and musical style that draws you in and makes you feel like you're popping $10 worth of quarters into the machine just to beat two levels again. It's not only beautifully designed, but it also contains one of the most imaginative visions of a sci-fi world I've ever seen. Where every other Shmup follows the ""Oh noes! There are aliens coming from Dimension X and only you in the prototype YXZ fighter can defeat the intergalactic hoards!"" formula, this game stretches it a bit further with it's alternate reality, colonization-of-Mars instead of America take. It makes for levels you haven't seen before and attains that rare quality most Shmups outside Metal Slug fail to grasp. The replayability is great too. The mechanic that draws you to play more is through the acquisition of cash at the end of levels which is then used in the game store to unlock new ships, weapons, levels, and game modes. It is a great method to get you to replay the 10 or so levels over and over and over. It's also one of the few Shmups where I'm actually capable of completing higher difficulties because the game does a fair job of ramping it up. It doesn't just throw you into Dark Souls: Shmup Edition.If you love Shmups, this is honestly my favorite so far on Steam and I've played almost all of them. And do yourself a favor, get the edition with the soundtrack. It's one of the best freakin' soundtracks I've ever heard in a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best shoot em up style games I have played! I just had a lot of fun with this! I will be finding myself coming back to this time and again. I generally find the genre to be kind of boring and overly impossible which is why I don't play schmups too often. This game fixes that! Very fun. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Great music, beautifully animated sprites, lovely explosion and particle effects, plus great bullet heck gameplay. Definitely recommend it for anyone who grew up with an SNES.

												An addicting SHMUP game set in an alternate timeline where English Settlements were built on mars. The gameplay is classic bullet-hell chaos, with a multitude of different control options.  You can choose from four unique ships to battle a large cast of enemies and bosses.The games has a fair learning curve by requiring you to beat earlier levels on higher difficulties to unlock the later challenges. There are also plenty of extra challenges to keep you entertained. The graphics have a polished retro look, and the music is fantastic. Seriously, this is one of those games worth it for the music alone. Great soundtrack! The game also sports up to four player local co op, which is as fun as it is hectic. So buy this! One of the best modern SHMUPS out!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am not a fan of the bullet hell genre. I AM a fan of Jamestown. Unlike when playing other bullet hell shmups, I never felt like Jamestown was difficult for the sake of difficulty or taunting my failure to finish a level in some ultra-niche genre. Instead, the Vaunt mechanism, the level design, and the overall tone of the game always seemed to suggest, ""You can do it! Try again!"" The risk/reward design philosophy behind Vaunt is simple yet brilliant, allowing players to focus on survival or gaining points or a balance between. Perhaps most importantly, the game just /feels/ good to play. Few modern games are this much fun. And don't let the lack of online co-op dissuade you; the single-player experience is fantastic, replay value is great, and the game truly shines when you get one, two, or three friends to play with you on the same screen. There's nothing quite like the rush of victory when you and two buddies narrowly clear a level on Divine difficulty after the third or fourth try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well...the screenshots and trailer actually give you exactly what the game is about: a bullet hell shooter with a nice art style and beautiful music. It has a story element that you can simply forget about (so Mars is colonized in the medieval ages by the British, and they're at war with the spanish? Okay...nevermind. Just let me shoot some robots), an ingame shop  to unlock things (levels and ships mostly; not ship upgrades or levels) and...erm...well, that's it, really. Each ship has 2 firing methods; the 2nd one is more powerfull but slows you down.The thing is as arcade-ish as arcade gets: 3 credits with 3 lives each level. Better survive on that, because there is no way around it (lose everything, then you'll have to restart the entire level). The only power-up/mechanic in the game is gold that, once the meter is filled, makes you invisible for a few seconds.Keep in mind that this game has only 6 levels. Note that since they're all very beautiful and challenging, that many difficulties and bonus content really stretches this out, but you have to take this into account.Also...not sure if I'm the only one, but I just cannot get this game to look normal on fullscreen (1920x1080, win 8.1). Since this is the kind of game you really can't look away from your own ship, it doesn't matter as much, but still...meh. :-\Still...I prefer a short but very enjoyable game over a long stretched out one. It's not expensive yet does exactly what promised: frantic, frustrating-in-a-good-way action. So: recommended. :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jamestown is without a doubt one of the greatest shoot 'm ups that has been released in years. The game is very easy to learn, but the final levels and the challenge mode provide more than enough difficulty for the serious gamers. With the expansion it has only gotton better. The only thing missing is online co-op, but local it is close to perfect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jamestown is a classic arcade vertical shooter, but with a feeling that's just impossible to describe. The story interjects between levels and feels like it came straight from the diary of a colonial American, if a colonial American were ever involved in a war against Martians; yeah, the story is strange.The game isn't bullet hell, but sometimes it feels close. There'll be plenty of moments leaving you tensing up as you swerve to dodge a volley of shots, and a lot of edge-of-your-seat boss battles. The music helps too; every track is listen-worthy outside the game and each song gets the heart racing-- a word to describe the music is ""Epic"".My only complaint is it's damned short. A shump veteran can finish Jamestown in one sitting. However for the price, it's worth it. And there's also challenge modes and multiplayer once you've saved the world in the story-proper.

												Recently beat this game (all 5 stages offered) over the course of several hours. Being a big schmup fan, I could not resist purchasing this game when it was on a Steam sale. Having played quite a few schmup games (Gradius V, Raystorm/Crisis, Darius Burst, Ikaruga, Bug Princess, DonDonPachi), I went into this expecting a good time in bullet-hell.... but had gotten only about 60% of what I had expected. Was not ""blown-away,"" per say. The player hit-box did not appear to have issues, but the gameplay itself felt slightly lacking. Was a bit turned off at the fact that you have to ""unlock stages"" in a range of difficulties in order to play them. It felt like a cheap way to reduce the enemy/difficulty programming of the 5 stages.  The bosses also (even on harder difficulties) do feel a bit too easy to beat. 3.5 of 5 stars if you want to enjoy a decent schmup game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well...the screenshots and trailer actually give you exactly what the game is about: a bullet hell shooter with a nice art style and beautiful music. It has a story element that you can simply forget about (so Mars is colonized in the medieval ages by the British, and they're at war with the spanish? Okay...nevermind. Just let me shoot some robots), an ingame shop  to unlock things (levels and ships mostly; not ship upgrades or levels) and...erm...well, that's it, really. Each ship has 2 firing methods; the 2nd one is more powerfull but slows you down.The thing is as arcade-ish as arcade gets: 3 credits with 3 lives each level. Better survive on that, because there is no way around it (lose everything, then you'll have to restart the entire level). The only power-up/mechanic in the game is gold that, once the meter is filled, makes you invisible for a few seconds.Keep in mind that this game has only 6 levels. Note that since they're all very beautiful and challenging, that many difficulties and bonus content really stretches this out, but you have to take this into account.Also...not sure if I'm the only one, but I just cannot get this game to look normal on fullscreen (1920x1080, win 8.1). Since this is the kind of game you really can't look away from your own ship, it doesn't matter as much, but still...meh. :-\Still...I prefer a short but very enjoyable game over a long stretched out one. It's not expensive yet does exactly what promised: frantic, frustrating-in-a-good-way action. So: recommended. :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't let my scant amount of time fool you. I've played this game a lot on the console version and I intend to as well with this one on Steam. There's a lot of Shmups here on Steam, a lot of damn fine ones. Some are bullet hell shooters that test your vision and agility, others are straight up fragfests that just allow a lot of fun and are kind of forgiving. This game falls somewhere in between, which is perhaps the best part about it.I've been playing Shmups since the Gradius/Lifeforce days on the NES or R-Type on the SMS so I'm well versed in them but seeing as how I'm 32 now, I'm nowhere near as skilled as I once was. This is one of the few I can remember that gets me as excited as those used to. It's got that amazingly attractive Metal Slug/Neo-Geo era arcade graphical and musical style that draws you in and makes you feel like you're popping $10 worth of quarters into the machine just to beat two levels again. It's not only beautifully designed, but it also contains one of the most imaginative visions of a sci-fi world I've ever seen. Where every other Shmup follows the ""Oh noes! There are aliens coming from Dimension X and only you in the prototype YXZ fighter can defeat the intergalactic hoards!"" formula, this game stretches it a bit further with it's alternate reality, colonization-of-Mars instead of America take. It makes for levels you haven't seen before and attains that rare quality most Shmups outside Metal Slug fail to grasp. The replayability is great too. The mechanic that draws you to play more is through the acquisition of cash at the end of levels which is then used in the game store to unlock new ships, weapons, levels, and game modes. It is a great method to get you to replay the 10 or so levels over and over and over. It's also one of the few Shmups where I'm actually capable of completing higher difficulties because the game does a fair job of ramping it up. It doesn't just throw you into Dark Souls: Shmup Edition.If you love Shmups, this is honestly my favorite so far on Steam and I've played almost all of them. And do yourself a favor, get the edition with the soundtrack. It's one of the best freakin' soundtracks I've ever heard in a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the first shmups on Steam, Jamestown is definitely one of the better ones on Steam as well. The game has rather simple patterns along with an equally simple scoring system. But at the same time it is also quite fast paced and there are a LOT of stray bullets. I usually enjoy the slower, more bullet-dense type of shmup but this one definitely struck a chord with me regardless. Game has good art, good music.... it's a small game in scope, but everything it does it does right. The only disappointments are the lack of Steam Cloud in a game with unlocks (wasn't around at the time and never added), and that the co-op brazenly advertised in the trailer is local only. The latter is a real shame; I've played it in person with friends and it was a really enjoyable experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In short: This is one of the best local-coop games on steam right now.Me and my friends absolutely love this game. We've had several local-coop sessions trying to get through this game on some of the harder difficulty levels.The tension this game creates in a local-multiplayer setting is just unmatched by any other game. You'll find yourself screaming instructions at each other while trying to paying attention to the mass mayhem happening on the screen.We love the fact that it works with just about any input device, so getting it to work with 4 players shouldn't be a problem.I recommend playing this on a big-screen TV though, to maintain a good overview of what is going on. ;-) It can get very intense fast.

												An addicting SHMUP game set in an alternate timeline where English Settlements were built on mars. The gameplay is classic bullet-hell chaos, with a multitude of different control options.  You can choose from four unique ships to battle a large cast of enemies and bosses.The games has a fair learning curve by requiring you to beat earlier levels on higher difficulties to unlock the later challenges. There are also plenty of extra challenges to keep you entertained. The graphics have a polished retro look, and the music is fantastic. Seriously, this is one of those games worth it for the music alone. Great soundtrack! The game also sports up to four player local co op, which is as fun as it is hectic. So buy this!

The artstyle, poesy of the storytelling, and particularly the music, give this game an atmosphere that's akin to Wind Waker (think pirates, terrifying sea creatures, and a general buccaneering vibe). Also, the taut little propaghanda-esque quips before each level are great and get you psyched like no ""SO POWER WORKOUT PLAYLIST"" can. Everyone should play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An extremely enjoyable bullet hell game with features such as:4 player coop with additional mice, keyboards and gamepads (and an easy controls setup)5 Chapters/Levels with up to 5 difficulties for varying degrees of skill4 (7 with the DLC) different ships with very unique playstylesBonus Levels with varying objectives (also support 1-4 players)The pixel art may not be to everyone's liking but I liked its distinctive direction for gameplay purposes and story scenes.Bonus Levels, Ships and additional content such as gamemodes are tied in with a nice and steady progression system based on coins you get when finishing levels (the higher the difficulty, the more coins).It's a lot of fun with friends yet still addicting playing it solo.Jamestown was my first entry into bullet hell territory; the learning curve is nice and the gameplay simple yet hard to master. I definitely recommend Jamestown to anyone slightly interested in bullet hell games, you won't regret it (wait for a sale and get the DLC if you want the additional 3 ships, I enjoy them as much as vanilla ones).

The only complaint is that the final level becomes about 50x harder than the rest of the game. No problem, you won't mind going through it 10-15 times to beat the final boss. With 4 player local co-op on one computer, you have no reason to invite some friends over and play the hell out of this game, and considering it allows you to use as many mice, keyboards, and controllers as you want, it makes it extremely fun for the whole family to get involved.

At first I thought that it would be very difficult for me, but in this game the learning curve is perfectly made, and after a couple of hours of gameplay I was playing very hard difficult like nothing. The plot is good and interesting enough, and the pixel art is as good as the Japanese artist from the 16 bits era. Now the aspect that impresses me the most is the music, each track is an amazing master piece of “epicism” very uncommon in indie games.			",1865,710,79,230,238,18,346

												Great non-Cave SHMUP/bullet hell. The campaign is pretty good and forces you to go back and beat levels on harder difficulties before proceeding. There are a couple of upgrades and lots of challenges to complete as well. Controller support is excellent. Very solid game for the price8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun and challenging 2D scrolling shooter with a fantastic visual flair.I'll admit, I'm pretty biased. I love 2D scrolling shooter titles. That said, this is one of the more visually interesting and enjoyable ones I have come across in recent memory.The challenge is definitely there, but unlike some of the more notorious games in this genre, this one is at least not so frustrating that you can't hardly even enjoy it.The difficulty ramps up as you go along and unlock new stages, and it eventually shoehorns you into playing on the higher difficulty levels if you want to finish the game properly, but even if you have a hard time with these types of games, you'll at least be able to enjoy the earlier stages well enough for this one to be worth your time.A wonky yet refreshingly strange concept of a story helps bring some creativity to the title, and the ships and powerups are varied enough to make the mechanics feel fresh and interesting between each choice.

												If you have more than one friend, you are now forced to get Jamestown. No exceptions.What at first seems like an ugly old top-down shooter with a weird name is probably one of the most well-done co-op titles I've ever played (and I've played a lot of them). It doesn't require gamepads and you can use pretty much anything as controller, so nobody needs to come prepared.As far as negative aspects go, the worst is probably the considerably limited campaign which a good team can finish in just a few hours.

												I love the art style of this game.  The campaign itself is really short, only 6 missions. But there is a lot of additional stuff that can be done after you finish.  The Co-Op is a little misleading.  No, there is no online co-op. No, there is no LAN co-op. I was very disappointed by this because on Steam it says ""Local Co-Op"".  The only way this game can be played co-op is if someone is using the mouse, and the 2nd person is using the arrow keys. But even worse, it has 4-player co-op. Which means the 3rd person has to use WASD keys, and 4th person has to use a controller.  I think it's completely stupid the way they implemented co-op, even for an indie developer.This has no bearing on playing the game as a single player experience.  It was a solid fun gaming experience, and if you keep in mind to not be expecting anything more than a 1 - 2 hour story, then I suppose you should pick this game up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A bullet-hell game. Normally, most people just hear the words and move away from anything related to the genre. But Jamestown is easily an exception to that instinctive behaviour.If you're old enough to remember those games where you had a plane or a ship flying on a vertically-scrolling background and tanks/turrets/monsters/something evil appeared and lobbed a red ball of death towards your vessel, Jamestown doesn't fall very far from that tree. What you need to know is that, much like most of those games, enemies spawn at the exact same place every time you run the exact same level (that is, the level itself associated with a difficulty). Unlike those games, however, you get the chance to select the difficulty.Jamestown is nice enough to players new to the bullet-hell genre by having multiple difficulties. ""How is that nice?"" you're thinking. The easiest difficulty is easy enough for someone that never played any game in his life to learn patterns, which in turn make them develop a sense of where to be and where not to be given the properties of the ship they're using. And each step in the difficulty curve is acceptable at the point where the player can reliably clear a level without dying more than once; it's a proof of skill from the player's part. That said, most people won't be able to clear all levels at the highest difficulty the game offers, and possibly not even the one before that. If you're in it for the ""100%"", you better be prepared to invest a good time of your life here.But achievement nuts aside, Jamestown is full of strong points. The controls are responsive as you'd expect a game of the genre, the music is like someone tossed you a thousand dollars and said ""keep it, no strings attached"", the visual style is undoubitably gorgeous. It even has an unusual backstory in a strange futuristic-pastlike-future for a game with no reason to have a story, if you care about those things. It also has a sort of ""challenge mode"" where you try to complete hard tasks in a preset course; think of it as this game's minigames. You have an activatable invulnerability shield on certain conditions as a base game mechanic related to scoring points. You also get to have four different ships to blast the baddies, each very different in gameplay from the others, so you can specialize in one that best suits you or try to master all of them for added replayability. And of course, you have a ""gauntlet mode"" where even reaching its end is like getting a free pat in the back and a bucket of your favourite drink.If you're looking for weak points, the only things that come to mind is the extra ships dlc (because you either love them and use them or end up sticking to only one or non-at-all since you already love one of the base game's ships) and the inherent what-you-see-is-what-you-get replayability that's associated with fixed levels and how high the skill barrier is for you. If you're a master of the bullet-hell genre, the hardest difficulty may be less challenging than you'd hope.Also, one can not stress this enough: the music of this game is amazing. The soundtrack's extra cost? If you play the game and like it, I recommend you buy it to hear it outside the game; supposedly the money goes to the composer, which needs to eat just like you.All in all, Jamestown is a great game. A solid 8 out of 10 easily, maybe even more. If you consider the game a little costy, wait for a discount; if the music is also at a discount, make sure you also buy it if you liked it in-game. As for the dlc ships, hit or miss: if you like the game, and want to say you like the people that put their heart making it, buy; otherwise my opinion is avoid unless at a good discount.

												Jamestown is a shmup that's really worth getting.  My favorite is gauntlet mode, which is a decent approximation of a true arcade mode.  To get a grip on the scoring mechanics, try the score-based challenges and pay attention to what an enemy is doing when you destroy them and how it effects the bonus items (think of challenges more as scoring tutorials).There are multiple ships that really do play differently, and the levels have a lot of variety in them.  Four-player simultaneous play is an interesting bonus, but don't worry the game plays fine with just one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jamestown was my gateway drug into the world of shmups (shoot 'em ups). It's greatest asset is not its gloriously rendered pixel graphics, unique art design, tight controls, solid gameplay mechanics, stellar cooperative play, excellent support for a number of control peripherals, or soundtrack of better quality than that of the best triple-A productions. What really makes this game one of the best of its kind is its ability to constantly encourage the player to improve their skill, avoiding frustrating difficulty cliffs, and creating a degree of replay value rarely seen in titles of any genre. The only gripe I have is the lack of online multiplayer, which is easily forgiven given the incredible quality of the whole package. There is no reason for anyone to pass this up.

One of the very few good western (non-japanese) shmups.Personally I have one problem with this game: you have to control it with the mouse, because the keyboard controls don't work very well in this game (not very responsive and it's got some velocity problems). Since most danmaku usually work with keyboard controls, it takes some time getting used to mouse movement mechanics.8.5/10 (would have given 9/10 if keyboard controls weren't crappy)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very interesting game. Take Touhou, for the patterns, the small hitbox, the cherry border, and the general feeling, and mix it to metal slug's graphism, and you have Jamestown.Overall, it's a really fun game, with pvery good graphisms. Besides, you can play with 3 people on the same PC, so you better have a decent screen.Now for the cons:-compared to other bullet hell games, this game is too easy. You have 2 lives, and 2 coninues PER STAGE. There's a level-run option, but it's locked when you begin. Also, bosses are ridiculous easy, even the last one, I cleared him losing only one life.-also, the multiplayer seems quite interesting, but you can't play on teh Internet! If you want to try multiplayer, you have to bring your friends at home IRL! It's like a console on a PC!I dig hard to find those cons, because this game isn't really expensive, so it's unfair from me to be like that. It's a really good game, and I suggest you to try it. It's easy, you'll see.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Challenging but not punishing, Jamestown is dripping in well thought out detail. Set in a fascinating alternate universe, the story, sound, and gameplay are all completely top notch.			",93,25,1,3,3,0,11

												This is a 16-bit looking top down bullet-hell shooter set in an alternate history where 17th century Mars is a British Colony being fought over by the Spanish and the Martians. ...I know, right?			",574,168,12,46,32,4,49

												Honestly, Jamestown is the best game I've ever played. I am in love with everything about it; the art style, the music, the gameplay are all beautiful. The icing on the bullet-cake is of course the amazing local multiplayer, which is perfect.The game is easy enough to pick up, but progresses to fiendishly challenging if you so choose. I only wish the story were longer, but aside from that I cannot recommend this game enough!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great Shmup.  Very difficult but it is on par with the Japanese Shmup devs (e.g., Cave, Moss etcetera).  The futuristic Jamestown story is great and there is a lot of ship variety.  My only caveat is the lack of continues (but maybe that is because I am not good...haha).  Highly recommend if you like Shmups or shooters in general.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very underated game I think. Brings me back to when I was a kid and these type of games were very popular. It gets hard but I would have pumped quarters into this machine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the first shmups on Steam, Jamestown is definitely one of the better ones on Steam as well. The game has rather simple patterns along with an equally simple scoring system. But at the same time it is also quite fast paced and there are a LOT of stray bullets. I usually enjoy the slower, more bullet-dense type of shmup but this one definitely struck a chord with me regardless. Game has good art, good music.... it's a small game in scope, but everything it does it does right. The only disappointments are the lack of Steam Cloud in a game with unlocks (wasn't around at the time and never added), and that the co-op brazenly advertised in the trailer is local only. The latter is a real shame; I've played it in person with friends and it was a really enjoyable experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
