												somewhat enjoyable survival horror shooter gameplay, but occasionally has forced camera angles that quickly become an annoying hindrance. However, I was willing to overlook this in part due to the game's excellent atmosphere until a game-breaking glitch occurred near the end of the third mission. As if forcing you to babysit a helpless AI that chastises you whenever you stop holding her hand isn't enough, the game suddenly teleports her through a door before she properly unlocks it to let you through. Not sure how to fix and not sure I care. A slight upgrade from the first game. Enemy AI is basically the same, but the game itself is harder. Trying to change it up from the first one by adding new camera angles in certain areas of the game. It is repetitive, but it's a decent game. I do have to say that whoever developed level 4 is just an ♥♥♥. I mean, who thought it was a good idea to just fill a level up with all them birthing pods? Seriously, that was the worst idea ever lol.			",527,112,15,50,38,2,73

												Second game in the Alien Breed trilogy.  The graphics are still sharp giving you great environments, though the environments lack variety.  The action is well paced with some sporatic intense action sequences.  The lack of ammunition in the levels keeps the strategy of what weapons to use for different situations interesting.  I found it a bit irritating to keep backtracking over and over again on the same levels, however, this does give you a  sense of a huge level since the levels can take quite some time to beat.  Great fun at a great price.  Online multiplayer, while dead, is available for those that have friends that may want to play this with them.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												Finished alien breed impact and now im on alien breed 2.. And ohhh boy, im really digging the series.. Coop is a blast playing with the right friend. Love the new camera views they have placed in the game. This game/series could be fun if they made it into a fps or a 3rd person shooter kinda like a gears of war style. Game does get repetitive and i mean repetitive in less than 40mins but, if you love top down shooters with intense action and your heart pounding that you dont run out of bullets this is the game for you.proGraphics seem to be alittle bit better than alien breed impactTop down shooterupgradable weapons and customisationGameplay addictive and solidsound effectsCo-opEasy Achievementscons:small glitches that you can get stuck in wallsObjectives/gameplay gets repetitive			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

For more reviews and gameplay videos by Morgoth, check out the profile or the Twitch channel at twitch.tv/morgoth0221My review for the original Alien Breed: Impact can be seen on it's store page, and seeing how this game is nearly identical, I'm not going to go into full detail.  While I did recommend Impact, I simply cannot recommend Assault.  The only thing this game does better is the graphics.  That is it.  Even in that department, a lot (and I mean a lot) of the rooms and floors were identical to the original game!  That's just lazyness.  This was by far, much more mind-numbing than the original as there didn't really seem to be much plot at all.  Around 90% of this game was just wondering around from one objective to another with no clear idea of what each objective did to actually affect the plot.  It's like this game was literally just filler.  There was some plot exposure near the end of the game to explain what exactly is going on, but it was all bundled into one single cutscene.  Why were there four other levels?  They serve no purpose.  Maybe it's just me, but whenever a game sets an objective for your character and you fight through countless (generic) enemies to reach said objective, I feel like something should have been accomplished besides just setting another objective.  The storytelling is pretty dull.There are a few more changes from the original however.  A few new enemies were introduced (one I believe, and it is just incredibly annoying).  They changed out two of the weapons from the original (laser rifle and ion thingy), for the hyper blaster (really good for mowing down tons of enemies), and the almost completely useless rocket launcher.  Yes, this weapon does tremendous amounts of damage to all in the blast range....including you.  Now, that does make sense in any game that a weapon as powerful as a rocket launcher is a double-edged sword, but in retrospect, in other games you can aim the damn thing.  In Assault, you can only choose the direction.  That means if the smallest little alien makes his way somehow right in front of you at the last second before you're about to fire a damn missile, it will explode point blank....killing you instantly.  Not even close to being worth it, as some save points can be up to ten to 15 minutes behind you.Other than that, there are three (kind of) new boss fights in this one with one of the fights taking place very near the beginning, which was refreshing.  And honestly, it was the only slightly interesting one.  The second boss fight which takes place near the end of the game was so dull, I wasn't really sure it was a boss fight.  It's only attack seemed to be throwing a ton of little enemies at you at once.   .....and that's it.  FYI, don't use the rocket launcher on him as you will most likely kill yourself.  And finally, the last boss fight which was actually just a bunch of enemies all at once, was unbelievably underwhelming.  Saw the giant turret you sit in, got excited, was blown away about how dull it was to fire that turret.  Put some damn impact in those shells!  Make it fun!  Make it exciting!  Just not this.  I might as well have been firing the pistol as it felt the same.Overall, I do not recommend this game in the series at all unless you're up for wasting 5 hours.  If you really want to play the trilogy, play the first, read about the plot in the second, and go play the third.  Right now, I'm two missions into the third and I have to say it looks like the best of the three by far.  As for this one....just don't.			",321,38,4,53,19,0,49

												If you were around for the awesome summer sale with the tickets and prizes, you probably have this game in your backlog because I think it was the only full game you could get with tickets. Obviously I've been sitting on it for years, and despite its apparent similarities to Shadowgrounds (which I love, get it) I've never given it a try. But my internet was out one particular night and I didn't have much time to play so I figured it was finally time.Alien Breed is an isometric shooter from Team17, far better known for their excellent Worms 2, Worms Armageddon, and all the awful Worms games that came after those. This installment is the middle part of a trilogy whose story appears to be completely unimportant. Your grizzled spaceman is stuck on an exploding derelict ship that you need to either escape from, stop from exploding, or both. I got a little muddled in there because the cutscenes are voiced poorly and the in-game direction is just text.But you really need to pay attention to all that text because the majority of the game is backtracking and flipping switches. Seriously, in the 40 minutes I played I fixed like 5 doors, three valves, flushed coolant, refilled coolant, and started three backup generators, one of which exploded and had to be repaired. Your character in Shadowgrounds is an actual mechanic and you do less busywork fixing than your hard-boiled spaceman in Alien Breed. Interaction is the new standard ""Hold X for 5 seconds to fix/open/hump"" which REALLY adds up in this game. In addition, half of the things you interact with trigger boring in-game cutscenes of machines moving around that add up even faster.It's a shame too, because Alien Breed looks good for a budget shooter. It's built in Unreal3 and makes good use of the engine. The combat is good as well, but sadly not as varied as Shadowgrounds in guns or enemies. The main problem is that you start with a ridiculously effective assault rifle that can then be upgraded further, rendering most of your other weapons moot. There's a standard assortment of shotgun, flamethrower, minigun, and rocket launcher to pick up and upgrade, but outside of corner cases your AR is going to get the job done better. Plus you can pick up gear like grenades and turrets that further marginalize your other weapons. There are only a few enemy types to shoot and almost all of them are the ""get up in your grillpiece"" type, which only exacerbates things further because your assault rifle has a knockback effect. I really don't know what they were thinking with this thing.There's a story mode with all the switch-flipping valve-turning annoyance I mentioned, a survival mode where you just kill huge waves of aliens, and a co-op mode which I didn't even bother looking into. I don't know if Alien Breeds 1 and 3 are better balanced in terms of weapons and switch-flipping, but 2 here just wasn't doing it for me. If you don't have Shadowgrounds it might do the trick for you, otherwise I wouldn't bother.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												A solid Twin Stick Shooter.If you want to mow things down with no ethical quandry, this is a good game series. I had fun all the way through. It doesn't do anything unique or ground breaking, but it's solid for what it is. The game has a good number of weapons, each good in different situations. Flame thrower is fun.I think one of my few complaints about this game series is a minor preference thing. There's 3 different upgrades for each weapon but you can only choose ONE. If you upgrade to another you will only be using the new one, not both. Just a money saving tip.			",209,68,3,79,40,1,45

												This is an excellent way to waste a few hours. I was a big fan of the original game and so when this new and updated version came out I was pretty excited. From what I can remember of the 90's game, this seems to be pretty faithful to the original. Pick up a gun, kill aliens. Admittedly some of the mission tasks can be pretty repetitive, and the story.. exists... but thats not what this game is about. With the unreal engine behind it I sometimes felt that this is what XCOM would be if it was just the combat in real time. In any case, I enjoyed myself with this one. 8/100 Comments				",131,26,0,25,11,2,51

Foreword.Before I begin the review, I'd like to say that I got this game for free during the 2011 Steam summer event, where you could pick various pixel items aswell as this game. This game is best described as Starship Troopers and Dead Space having a baby.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What Alien Breed 2 is about.You're a combat engineer named Conrad sent to a large spaceship to discover what has happened to it. You are greeted by waves upon waves of different aliens, skinless cadavers of the former personal aswell as the ongoing destruction of the ship and the alien infestation inside of it.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gameplay.A over the top shooter, you aim and turn Conrad by moving your mouse around the edges of the screen. Few times did I try where the aiming would be unprecise because of this.There is quite a selective amount of weapons to find and use. You start with a pistol and eventually can get a shotgun, assault rifle, rocket launcher aswell as a minigun. The aliens are quite different themselves, both appearance wise and abilities to fight you with. A few honourable mentions would be the time slowing alien, aswell as an alien that can lift up some kind of shield to block your bullets, but won't be able to move. Another alien can heal the rest. The other aliens are more simpler, like a long ranged alien. The rest are simple meatshields and can easily be taken down. There are also alien pods around the game which spawn small child aliens and when they attack you, they implode, rendering them not a massive threat, only in large numbers.You can also find and buy healthkits, grenades, body armor, turrets you can place around the game at ""powerpoints"". You use X to switch between your items, and right click to hold down the useable item.As mentioned, you eventually come to saveable stations where you can also buy items, ammo and upgrades for your weapons, aswell as the items. Throughout the spaceship you can explore, finding credits and items.The interaction system isn't the best. When opening doors a bar will appear over Conrad showing the progress untill you have activated the item. If you stop, the progress will reset. This forces you to redo it should an alien or more appear suddenly, coming for you. This counts for everything. Checking a dead body for loot, checking lockers etc. There are even spots where you must do this for atleast ten seconds, while risking being attacked from behind.The aliens rarely appear running around, instead, they -always- come up from the floor, leaving a hole. It also makes a sound, one you will hear atleast one thousand times, as they can be heard breaking up from the floors ahead of you. The spaceship clearly has a massive ventilation system around it or there's alot of space below the floor boards.This games uses cutscenes alot, especially during entering through a scanning room, waiting for a walkspace bridge to turn around and link with the one youre on and even when going up or down an elevator. Which is horrendious, as you don't have much to look at, leaving you waiting and wasting a few seconds of your life on something so pointless.Some places in the game you can't turn your camera, leaving you forced to use your minimap and see when aliens approach, though this only occurs two or three times.There are only two boss battles in this game, first one is relatively good and slightly challenging. The second on the other hand is overused. Without revealing too much spoilers, it forces you in a camera angle to fight off the boss and extra aliens, but happens atleast three times, the very same cut scenes and boss tactics, aswell as how the boss attacks you. It's one of the worst boss battles I've ever encountered and is defently among my top 10 worst.There is in all, 5 chapters, where each one takes almost an hour and a half. Overall only giving you around 6-7 hours of campaign storymode.There are other modes aswell though, you are able to replay the chapters again, and there is a survival mode where you can play with a friend. But trying to find other players through the matchmaking seems impossible as the game is abandoned long time ago when it comes to multiplayer. Your best bet is asking around on the forums.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Graphics.The graphics for this game isn't bad, atleast for a game that came out in 2010.The game world is detailed and has alot of objects cluttered around a destroyed spaceship. The alien infestation appears on the ground and walls and you will encounter lairs of alien pods, the rooms fully covered in alien nastiness. A neat detail is that you can see the outside of the spaceship, aswell as the engines at some parts of the game. The aliens look great graphics wise, though one of them looks more comical than scary, being able to stretch its mouth wide.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Storyline.The story is your usual sci-fi horror with aliens killing off humans. Only difference here is, that you only encounter one other person, who's from what I gathered, an android or such.The story does have a small hinting buildup, but that's where it also stops with the goodness.During each chapter start and end, you are shown cutscenes in a comic styled manner with background voice acting.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My opinion and is it worth it's pricetag?It's not worth the 8,99 or so price tag, and I'm sure it costed more back in 2010. Though I did get this for free. But for 4,99, it's worth it. This game isn't for any gamer though. You really have to like over the top shooters and the overall theme this game has.The game tries very hard to be scary, but fails to achieve this. There are a few nice small surprises, but they are very, very few. One good example was entering a changing room, and searchng a locker, only to have an alien come out of the ground behind me and attack. Other than that, the game lacks surprises. The game does have a few interesting rooms, like a boxing ring with spectator seats.At the last chapter, the game overuses an annoying laughter, without spoiling too much, which only serves as destroying the game's horror atmosphere. The only other person you encounter has one of the worst walking animations I've seen, and leaves you cringing. Makes you feel the devs at Team17 rushed this particular part.I started on this game back in late december and lasted two hours of playing it. Since then I've been playing it once or twice a month, at first for an hour or so, eventually only playing it for 20-30-45 mins.I'll be honest here and say, it took me quite a commitment to get myself to play this done. This game isn't for everyone, and I would defently not buy it for it's current price. The game is way too repetetive.I read some other reviews, and it was stated that the two other games, the first and last one, this being the second, are extremely alike in both content and graphics.There is no doubt you're left wondering about Team17's sales tactics. Instead of combining all three games together and making one massive game, they split it up into three games.This is why I've downvoted this game mainly. It's a low sales tactic by an otherwise famous company for their worms franchise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alien Breed is an isometric sci-fi shooter where you independently control the direction your character aims and moves. You maneuver through a series of 5 stages in each episode, collecting weapons and items, and shooting aliens as they appear while you move from objective to objective provided on your mini-map.It is difficult to write a separate review for each Episode, as they all largely play the same - you move from point A to point B to pick up access code C to open door D to get to point E to get access code F to.....you get the picture. Lots of backtracking through same-looking corridors, fighting similar looking enemies which pop out of the floor and walls.It's fun, but only moderately so - I would NOT recommend playing through a single episode in one sitting, let alone all three episodes. The gameplay is repetitive and it's the sort of thing you'll want to put down for a while between sessions (I'd actually say on the level of months between episodes) so it doesn't get stale.

												As I wrote for Alien Breed 1's review... This game is MOTS : more of the same. After playing through two levels out of five, I was right... Other than one new piece of equipment, two weapons (gatling and rocket, replacing laser and ion spike) the game is almost exactly the same as episode 1. So, here's a repost of the review, except the title was substituted for Alien Breed 2.  Also add one bug: in level 2 (or was it 3?) the part where you have to escort MIA through the ship, MIA arrived at the elevator, but will not move toward the core even as I cleared the area of all hostiles. Any way: read my old review. It is perfectly accurate. --------Alien Breed is a trilogy of games from Team 17 that basically has Conrad, a hardened engineer, fighting his way through his own ship, the Leopold, and an unknown alien ship, in a third-person shooter. He is up against bajillion nasties clearly inspired by Aliens, complete with ""squishy"" floor, little ""scorpion"" type critters, and bigger insectoids, among others. Conrad is given a bunch of weapons, from the good ol' pistol (infinite ammo) to assault rifle, shotgun, flamer, and two heavy weapons, as well as grenades, health kits, and other auxilary items. Most items need to be found though, and there are ""credits"" left around, as well as search corpses for additional goodies like ammo and credits. Credits can be spent on upgrades, ammo, and other bonuses at any Intex terminal, which also serve as mission save points (only 3 savegames allowed). The graphics are quite good, but camera management is somewhat archaic, yet understandable. Most games that adopt 3rd person has auto camera, but this game has a manual camera system that you can manually rotate around the character in 45 degree increments. It feels weird but once you start playing you understand that this is actually good as enemies *can* come from all directions and this gives you more flexibility in determining which angle to view the action. The game is very playable on a dualstick gamepad but can also be played with keyboard / mouse combo where the Q/E keys rotate the view. On a gamepad it would be the shoulder buttons. The problem with this game is the gameplay gets repetitive very quickly on various ""Fedex"" missions. Every mission you go on has multiple complications, which requires you to do something else, which may yet require something else too. For example, you're trying to get the mainframe online to control the engines. To reboot the mainframe you have to reinitialize the power source on three areas, then each area you will probably have to clear it to enemies, activate the fire supression system to clear the fire, then another to clear the toxic gas in the next room, etc. etc. There is a TON of backtracking, and that gets quite... boring. The game also breaks up the action as you to loot every corpse (human corpse, not the alien ones) and locker along the way, as well as buy ammo (!?) if you run low or out. And often the looting yields nothing. Trigger discipline becomes second nature, as is switching weapons and use the infinite ammo pistol as much as you can. You need to save the money for upgrades, and money is NOT plentiful in this game (and if you spend it all on ammo you can't upgrade!)Music is not bad, sound effects are decent, but the game play... Hmmm... As I said, it does get repetitive, and the other two games in the series can only be MOTS: more of the same. All in all, Alien Breed is an action game, and a bit old. Buy it when it's on sale. ",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												I went into this thinking that I would have a separate section for each installment in this trilogy, but (after putting what I have deemed significant time into each of them) I have decided to lump them all in together as there wasn’t much difference between any of them. That being said, let’s get started shall we?I – Story [2/10]The gist of the story is this: Conrad, the Chief Engineer of the Leopold, are trying to restore power to your ship whilst doing battle with hordes of aliens and contending with a possessed AI. And that, kids, is all she wrote. I realize this is a remake, but honestly? That’s all?II – UI [6/10]In part one of the trilogy (Alien Breed: Impact) the UI (or User Interface for the less savvy among us) was colored blue and was infuriatingly hard to see at almost any given moment. Thankfully, in installments two and three, the color had been changed to green and was infinitely easier on the eyes. The mini-map was rather reliable, making it mostly unnecessary to consult the full map often. Apart from that, HUD was minimal and user friendly.III – Gameplay [1/10]Altogether I found Alien Breed to be underwhelming practically at every turn. The game is played from a top-down angle with rigid and irritating camera controls. The objectives were mind-numbingly repetitive and I found myself getting overly bored about an hour into the first game. I present to you a dramatization of just about every thing you do in these games.“Turn on the cranky thing to put out the fires.”*Kills aliens*“Oh no, the cranky thing is broken. Go reboot six computers to fix the cranky thing.”*Kills aliens*“Good job on rebooting the computers. You can turn on the cranky thing now. Also, here are some more aliens for you to kill.”And that, ladies and gentlemen, is quite seriously the entire game. Sure, you get an odd boss battle here and there, but I’ll be damned if they aren’t just as repetitive and underwhelming as the rest of the game. My other biggest complaint about all the games was the weapon upgrading system. This game is how far into the future and I can only have one upgrade installed on my weapon at a time? What kind of garbage is that? IV – Content [4/10]With this being a trilogy, you’d assume they’d add some new content into each game right? Well, they did, but I had you going there didn’t I? Impact was easily the worst game in the trilogy. The campaign (in all three games, mind you) was downright awful. Part two (Alien Breed: Assault) added in a “Survival Mode” which was mildly entertaining. It was a billion times more fun than the campaign, that’s for sure. The enemies felt uninspired; most of them looked like the bugs from Starship Troopers only fatter and more ludicrous. The weapons were a bit boring as well, though I did particularly enjoy using the flamethrower. (Who doesn’t?)V – Visual [6/10]There isn’t much to say here really. The graphics throughout the trilogy were consistently the same, with varying levels of obnoxious explosions everywhere. I realize the ship is crashing, but come on. That being said, the graphics weren’t too bad and the lighting was good.VI – Audio [4/10]I found the sound effects to be rather lacking. The guns weren’t thrilling in the least and the little, face-hugger-esque aliens, I would swear on my non-existant childrens’ graves’, were frog noises.

												NEGATIVE REVIEW, not recommending.I can safely say that this review will match my review of the first game word for word. Around 8 hours of tedious, repetitive gameplay. I read many reviews about how all three Alien Breed games are basically the same game, and upon completing the second game, I have to admit, they're right about what they said. This game has no real improvement over the first one, with the exception of a few small things. The plot is not very memorable, as per the first game. All I remember is that we're fixing YET ANOTHER ship, and there were some areas of it that I could recognize distinctly being in the first game--they're reusing maps. It exposes way too much of the environment with this tactic.It's always ""go to this objective, kill aliens, fix it, kill aliens, go back to where you first started off, kill more aliens, rinse and repeat"". They tried to revive the classic Alien Breed, but this developer isn't doing so well nowadays. If you're a fan of monotonous works, it's for you. Otherwise, steer clear of it. The two things that I found nice that they did change was the boss and the actual real antagonist. There is a more interesting boss battle halfway into the game; however, the way they go about it made it seem petty the third time you had to kill the SAME BOSS that just got crushed within a train. It's just not logical. But the fight was more interesting.And then the antagonist. In the first Alien Breed game, there didn't feel like there was any main antagonist to fight; the only thing you could call your enemy was the aliens that were constantly attacking you. Near the end of the game, they FINALLY decided to bring up a being that you could call your antagonist of the story. I love whoever voice acted him--it's very pleasant to hear in a world of monotonous voices that you'll never be able to recall. However, the comics between chapters aren't telling me enough about this character, and I'm wondering why this antagonist is even trying to stop Conrad from destroying the ship. There's too many plot holes to be able to fully enjoy this mysterious antagonist. Also, the ending was complete bull. It was disappointing and did NOT leave me wanting to know more, because of how dull and anti-climactic it was in the end. I'll be honest, I did TRY to enjoy it, thinking that it was just my preference of games that made this so unappealing to me to play, but after reading tens of reviews about the lackluster gameplay, I feel that I can stand by my review.

												Good sequel to the first game though I should say that being in the same spaceship without real novelties apart the weapons and one alien... but well, you have MIA joining the party, so...That's how I can summarize Alien Breed 2: Assault. After colliding with your ship, you're aboard that ancient lost ship, discovering what happened really, helped by MIA, the robot that you have to trust to get out alive. However, given the weird creatures that are living in it, you guess that it will not be a round of pleasure but a full assault that you will be conducting. Given the fact that nearly nothing changed, here's a copy/paste from my review for the first part of Alien Breed, which was Impact.The solo campaign is about the main character but don't forget you have a co-op one where you play with a friend as two other members of the ship exploring the other vessel.The game is seen in 3D isometric, meaning that you have a little time to adapt to the command and the view when you're used to 3rd person or 1st person game.I remembered enjoy the game, mainly because you have perhaps normal weapons but also a powerful one, that I should add, different in each Alien Breed game. Yeah, true, when you're in the high difficulty, you have to adapt your way of playing before a game over because you didn't check your health.Anyway, your PDA is also nice as you're finding also notes from other persons, you have also a nice map to see where you are... and the terminals are in reality a save point and a shop for ammo or health.The HUD is green, like the title in the header. So, everything (texts on the screen) will be green too. The game is also told with cutscenes drawed as comics. And well, green is also the main color.Alien Breed: Assault is a nice game, though I'm kinda sad in co-op, it was kinda lagging and that we lost each time at the end of the level. If you don't own the trilogy, you shouldn't hesitate!By the way, I began to play Alien Breed with this game, as it was given for ""free"" during one of the first summer sales. I don't remember the mechanics but many of us back then got the game like that. I've bought the rest and I wasn't really disappointed.			",852,759,11,38,65,8,71

												I can credit Alien Breed 2: Assualt not with originality but with it's ability to entertain. This is a mindless shooter in parts but it does feature low-level item and ammo management akin to a survival horror, aswell as frequent backtracking. Team 17 succeeds in making the levels of Alien Breed 2 as claustraphobic and confusing as possible which can be taken either as bad or good depending on the situation. Quite frankly, I've found this series of remakes to grow on me. Although As a fan of the original Amiga Alien Breed, I expected more. I hated the generic design yet I dug the challenge that the game offered and the controls, although first confusing, work responsively.  Alien Breed 2 has many design quirks, many presentation issues that make it difficult to endorse. Alien Breed 2 lacks polish and the game's inability to fix those same problems found with the first episode is upsetting. Never the less, it is good on the low price tag, only nothing special.

												The first Alien Breed was a fun twin stick top down shooter, but ultimately a repetitive stunted game. A lot of backtracking through samey environments, and a lack of variety made it somewhat of a chore to play through.This second part addresses all of the issues, and has some decent bossbattles and enhancements to the formula. Whereas the first was pretty straightforward run'n'gun gameplay, this is like a miniature DeadSpace 2. Exciting setpieces now add some variety to the experience, that was sorely needed after the monotony of the first game.It looks good (but not stunning), sounds great, and plays really well. If you played the first, and didn't like it, I would recommend taking a look again at this - its much improved. The third game is even better.....Part 2 & 3 are really great games after the rocky start part 1 had.If you haven't played the first game and have somehow still come across this review - the series on the whole is well worth a look for a simple and fun shooter, with a decent challenge. Part 1 is a little dull to get through, but from then on it's a cracking ride and I thoroughly recommend it.			",473,127,14,37,10,0,48

												Part two of a trilogy, Assault delivers a competent top-down shooter experience with decent voice acting and atmosphere that reminds one strongly of the films from which the series was derived. The series increases in intensity, and I think, quality, as it progresses. Assault in particular has some of my favorite action sequences of the trilogy.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

												After playing Alien Breed 2: Assault, I must recognize that there are many improvements : the story has more depth, the level layout and the pacing are better. But the camera still rotates by 45° increments, and since the aiming is relative to your orientation, each time you rotate the camera, your aiming rotates ; and not in a discrete way. This completely ruins the potential flow of the game.			",216,35,0,31,6,0,20

												Alien breed: Assault is the second game in the trilogy reboot of Team 17's original game. Its a basic top down twin stick shooter with average gameplay. Its not bad, but its not very creative or original. It took about 2 hours to complete. The graphics are ok, but again nothing special. Its passable, but not worth it at full price. I know its a copy of my Alien Breed: Impact review but this is how the second game is in comparison to the first one.			",383,62,12,32,26,3,50

												I got Alien Breed 2 for free during the Summer Camp, and I'm SO glad I didn't pay money for it, because its really bad. Its a 3rd person shooter where the direction youre aiming, and the way the camera is facing, move independantly of each other, and as a result its difficult to control. The combat isnt exciting, all the aliens attack by simply running straight at you, and none of the guns feel different tactically. The only reason you need to change weapon is if you run out of ammo for the one you were using. This is a game that NEVER lets go of your hand for a single second. Every mission is ""go to this waypoint and press this button"". Your NPC companion frequently gives you updated objectives during combat, but she is not voiced, and I constantly missed the text because I was busy trying not to die. I think its about 5 hours long, not totally sure, because I've been autosaved into a bug and I can't progress past mission 3 without restarting, which I can't be bothered to do :(			",144,30,0,15,8,2,16

												The second part of the Alien Breed series, this is my first A.B game i played since i don't own part 1. When playing you can slightly feel that is was made with the twin-sticks controller in mind, on most occasions you won't have a hard time with the keyboard/mouse controls but as soon as a enemy is close too you it can be rather difficult to turn around and shoot.The game exists out of a one-player: Story-mode, Free-play-mode and survival mode. Story mode is self explaining, Free-play-mode is a replay-mode and survival is a wave based survival mode. multiplayer consists out of a Coop assault mode, the story-mode but then coop, and the Coop survival mode.The game:Starting the single player for the first time gives a you small recap of what happened in Alien Breed 1, the cut-scene has the old comic book style and what probably is the first thing to notice is the high quality of the dialogs. The background resembles that of a terminal screen and fits the overall look of the game, the green really suits the game as a whole. In-game notification are also green and appear on your HUD as text, depending on the area you are in this can cause a little bit of difficulty to read the text. The graphics look really good, you can see that the dev's took the time to make the levels as in the big amount of details. The music and sound effects fit perfectly in the whole atmosphere of the game, the cries of the aliens are also really good. Objectives in the main campaign are mainly going from A to B and activating a switch to proceed in the level.Verdict:I personally didn't like the campaign mode so i mainly played the survival mode instead, this could be because i actually don't really like top down shooters. it's also worth mentioning that the on-line match making is pretty much deserted but besides that the graphics are really good and and with a twin-stick controller you will probably get the most out of this game. Although top-down-shooters aren't really my type of game i still rate it a 7/10.			",754,215,31,108,83,5,147

												I had no intention of buying this, but it was part of the Indie Gala 9 bundle I bought ... and was I ever glad I installed it! Lots of run 'n' gun, mindless fun. Good graphics and atmosphere. The weapons were mostly enjoyable, though I mostly used the assault rifle (machine gun) and hyper gun (portable gatling gun) to greatest effect.  I did read a complaint on Metacritic that there's a lot of backtracking, but I think this is overstated. There was always plenty to kill, so you're rarely ever just running back and forth with nothing to do. There's a radar that gives you direction on where to go, so you'll never get lost. And if you're like me and have a terrible sense of direction, everything looks new anyway. :)			",724,284,47,114,46,8,71

												Looking for a good ""Alien Breed"" game? Get Alien Swarm, which comes as highly recommended, but do not get this rubbish.Not recommended based on trying to knock over a few Steam achievements after getting this for free. One of the games I wish I could remove from my library.			",176,23,1,9,6,0,20

												Alien Breed comes in ""3 Episodes"" and if you like games like the Free2Play game Alien Swarm then you should try all three Episodes of Alien Breed. That would Be:Alien Breed: ImpactAlien Breed: AssaultAlien Breed: DescentCan recommend. Only flaw i found was the Co-op part of the game, its a stand alone four diffrent missions that you can play, and not the main campaign played in Co-op (Sadly). Later games even have survival mode.

												Frankie Dunn has trained and managed some incredible fighters during a lifetime spent in the ring. The most important lesson he teaches his boxers is the one that rules life: above all, always protect yourself. In the wake of a painful estrangement from his daughter, Frankie has been unwilling to let himself get close to anyone for a very long time. His only friend, Scrap, an ex-boxer who looks after Frankie's gym, knows that beneath his gruff exterior is a man who has been seeking, for the past 25 years, the forgiveness that somehow continues to elude him. Then Maggie Fitzgerald walks into his gym...Review paid for by: Coca-Cola			",219,35,5,31,43,1,59

												I had no intention of buying this, but it was part of the Indie Gala 9 bundle I bought ... and was I ever glad I installed it! Lots of run 'n' gun, mindless fun. Good graphics and atmosphere. The weapons were mostly enjoyable, though I mostly used the assault rifle (machine gun) and hyper gun (portable gatling gun) to greatest effect.  I did read a complaint on Metacritic that there's a lot of backtracking, but I think this is overstated. There was always plenty to kill, so you're rarely ever just running back and forth with nothing to do. There's a radar that gives you direction on where to go, so you'll never get lost. And if you're like me and have a terrible sense of direction, everything looks new anyway. :)			",724,284,47,114,46,8,71

												Hey, I remember when I got this during that Steam summer thing.The Summer Shades were a far better reward than this game....What, not enough of a review? Alright.Basically, in this game, you walk around, shoot stuff, turn some valves, and... uh... that's about it. It's pretty straight forward. The lack of complexity doesn't really help it.I would never pay $10 for this. Buy something else instead.I hate to just write it off, but, seriously, unless you are REALLY into games like this, just get something else.			",433,58,5,45,25,5,63

												The aliens haven't changed, weapons haven't changed, all game elements the same as the original game-Alien Breed: Impact. You need to do the same things the same as you do in the Alien Breed: Impact, you do it again and again, and spend one hour(nearly or more) on each level, it's so boring(boring story and boring operation). You can end this story in one game but the Developer developed 3 games to tell the whole story. It doesn't make any sense except for earning more money.和前作比起来，除了故事有变化以外，其他一切一切都没有改变。虽然说这不是一款""无双突突""类型的游戏，但是玩起来仍然是非常无聊（除非你是第一次玩，而不是先玩过前作），这不仅仅是情节弱的问题，更重要的是游戏本身就很无聊，特别是每一关都几乎需要用上1个小时去完成，而这1个小时无非就是重复重复再重复（毫不夸张的说，这游戏只有一关）。当你玩通关（玩过）第一部之后，再接触这一部，却发现什么都没变化，我觉得你就会发现自己已经没有力气再玩下去了。			",1010,324,33,155,93,7,173

Posted: November 3, 2014
												Since all three games are exactly the same this is the same review as the other two games.Not a great game but it has great weapons and really good graphics and very smooth gameplay. Why it's not a great game:1: The biggest massive problem, CONSTANT AND NEVER ENDING FOCUS STEALING FROM START TO FINISH. Which really is not that prevalent in the first game but is a major problem in the second and third games. The game constantly, more than any game I have ever seen, even Resident Evil 6, steals focus from you during events to make the camera spin a little while zooming in and force you to watch the stupidest most mundane♥♥♥♥♥♥like a grate opening or a switch turning on or ANYTHING. It was like the developers found a little focus stealing trick and went way, way, way overboard with it. It is aggravating to astronomical levels and does not feel like you are playing a game but something where you get to play only sometimes when it lets you. Again, not so bad in game one but a massive problem in games two and three.2: CONSTANT screen shaking from explosions. It caused me to have to play each game from start to finish with a non-stop bad headache.3: The sound is very low. I have to turn my volume way way up when playing this game which is a big problem because of course I am not going to remember to turn it back down when I'm done playing so the next thing I do, like play music or play another much better game, blows my ♥♥♥♥ing ears off.4: There are very few types of enemies. I think 5 or less. And even those 5 all feel the same.5: The game is very, very repetitive. What you do in the first fifteen minutes is exactly what you do in every other minute of all three games. The game offers no variety at all, especially since all 3 games are mirror images of each other.6: The environments from the start to finish of all games is all exactly the same from game to game. Even though each game takes place in a different area of the ship or I think on different ships maybe, all three games are completely identical.7: All 3 games are very short, about 4 hours each.8: Crashes/glitches. I don't think I had any trouble with the first two games, maybe one or two crashes in the second game. The third game has crashed three times now. Once early, then half way through it, and now near the end. Their forum pin says it could be a file validation to fix it, but who cares when the games have the other bad problems I pointed out. And YES I understand it is a problem on my end. But no other games crash so it is a problem on my end caused by something to do exclusively with this game in particular and none of the other 150+ games I have installed.It's sad because the games graphics are outstanding and the gameplay is very, very smooth. But because of the main flaws being so incredibly bad, I can only recommend them if you can catch them on sale like I did for $5.65 for all 3 games. Their normal price of $10 each is laughable. Like throw your head back and audibly laugh loud. Once I play through them I'm never coming back to them, ever.Since all 3 games are the exact same, only one score is needed. Production quality in some areas like graphics and control is 8/10, everything else 5/10. Overall, 5/10. Badly missed opportunity for a all-time favorite cult classic. Whoever made this is jarringly inept.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												Like Alien Breed: Impact, Assault is a simple, isometric shooter that loses atmosphere faster than a hull breach. Five repetitious hours of running down dark corridors of an alien infested ship and fighting off waves of enemies and the only exciting part were the little crescendos and boss fights that sparsely dot the play-through. Think those little moments in Left 4 Dead where you press a button and wait as the music picks up and you know something big is coming.The little excitement doesn't make up for a tedious game. Don't get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is just a pretty horrible top down shooter. I see why they gave this away in a summer sale years back. Just download Alien Swarm. Its free, this isn't. Same premise but better, with more features, an SDK, and its on Source Engine.Cons-First boss battle and where I quit the screen is shaking and dang near constantly shaking in a way that actually made me feel disoriented in real life. Which is a rarity for the amount I play vidya games and speaks to the bad design.-To much of the game is opening doors or holding a button to activate something to walk to the next area that looks alot like that last.-Character can be pointing at and missing aliens and his aim snapping to the aliens isn't quite what you would want -Dark, gritty and brown graphics. Brooowwwwnnn. Like a turd.-No one owns it to play coop with they probably wouldn't want to though-Feels more like a Coop/online intended game than a single player experience. Like Borderlands. Feels somewhat empty without other players.Pros+It looks good for an UE3 game and the devs did some work trying to hide that cheap UE3 look but didn't succeed completely+Sound design can be quite good and pleasant to the ears+Cooperative play over network is always a good addition if you can find someoneAfter typing all this up I still feel a little weird and disoriented from that beginning of the boss battle. Man that was horrible. Never touching this game again.			",329,48,6,36,35,3,74

ALIEN BREED 2: ASSAULTA re-imagining of the classic Amiga series, Alien Breed, Alien Breed II and Tower Assault for the Amiga 500 and 1200Rating 3/10As a big fan of the original Amiga games I approached this new series of Alien Breed games with a mixture of excitment and apprehension. The original series core gameplay is still intact, fight your way through a hostile environment to gather key cards and cash whilst completing engineer based objectives along the way. What has been lost in the updating however is the character and look of the originals, this new Alien Breed is rather dull looking, and most importantly is lacking atmosphere.It's probably better to compare it to Alien Swarm than the far superior Dead Space series as it's a top down shooter with fairly simple fetch puzzles. There aren't really many positives to take from the game, the boss battles are horrendous although thankfully there are only two of them. The missions become repetitive quickly and the small number of alien variations leads to fairly stale gameplay.Having replayed the original Alien Breeds on my Amiga recently I'm not sure what makes them so great and what makes the new Alien Breed so dull. Perhaps it's nostalgia.			",251,59,8,29,21,2,31

												Apart from the story and 2 new weapons, it's pretty much the same as the previous one. ""A nice casual top down shooter if you are into those. If you're not, you won't probably find anything enjoyable here, the game is basicly ""Go there and activate this switch!"", ""Power down, go to the generator room and activate power"" and the storyline is nothing more than the ""usual alien infestation on your ship"". It's a very simple game you might enjoy it or you might not. I personally don't recomend it.""			",1393,387,26,190,117,15,203

												Terrible bug in the Escort level that prevents you from finishing the level.  An NPC character is supposed to open a door for you so that you can proceed, however the character instead jumps through the locked door and strands you on the other side.  You can't do anything other than restart the game from scratch and hope it doesn't happen.  I tried 10+ times and the NPC always jumps through the door.  What a disappointment!

												Alien Breed is similar to Alien Swarm or Shadowgrounds, but it has alot better graphics and it can be hard for some players, especially if they never played any game similar to those 3.Solo campaign is good, but the true potential of Alien Breed is in the co-op campaign; same style and same characters (Thadeus Barnes & Eddie Vance) as in Alien Breed 1 + now with the brand new survival mode and new weapons. I recommend you to play it with your friends rather than some random players, because if you want to survive you both need to share things before you take them, because you can't give anything to your friend straight from your inventory, which is one of the few bad things and it should be added into the game.Overall: 8.5/10			",48,0,0,6,0,0,5

												This game was free, but wasn't worth the time it took to play it.It plays exactly like other alien top-down shooters; except Shadowgrounds was more fun and Alien Swarm did Multiplayer better.Apart from the decent graphics (uses Unreal 3 engine) the game is just really underwhelming. Little to no story to speak of, boring♥♥♥♥♥repetitive missions, little variety in weapons (pistol, rifle, shotgun, minigun, rocket launcher: like it's purposely ticking all the generic boxes) and really poor netcode.Bland and boring; A staggering achievement in mediocrity. Don't bother with this, unless you have trouble getting to sleep.			",639,171,18,117,49,5,117

												Alien Breed is a game series that i believe is better than Alien swarm. Unlike Alien swarm, Alien Breed has singleplayer, and Survival. The only thing they have in common is they're both 3rd person shooter, and has Co-op. Unfortunlly other Alien breed games has the same style of gameplay and same achievements (Some of them). This game features: 6 weapon arsenal, 13 achievements, Items 4 survival, Comic cutscens, and part by part story line. If anyone would like to try out a game thats way better than Alien swarm than this game will satisfy u.Cost: $10Rating:69/100 Fair			",446,148,10,50,45,3,44

												Alien Breed 2: Assault deserves only a 20 second look on this page before you go look at another page (20/100)Alien Breed 2: Assault is a repetitive, boring and anti-climatic game. I would not recommend this game, even if you got it for free. There is no voice acting, the story is awful, gameplay is boring and the environment is copy and paste and the mutliplayer is empty. The only thing that was remotely fun for this game was the survival mode. Story: 2/10+Long, which is good -No voice acting-Cliche-Predictable Environment: 2/10+Looks beautiful-Copy and paste-The space outside is the same picture over and over again, regardless of angle, just with white lines in different directionsControls: 1/10+Controller enabled-Gotta manual turn camera angle -Awkward controls for keyboard and controllerGameplay: 4/10+Survival mode is really really fun, only good thing about this game-Repetitive-Same aliens over and over and over and over again-Takes forever to upgrade weaponsMultiplayer: 1/10+Has co-op-Co-op is same as single player so just as boring, no way to fool around			",381,83,9,58,33,3,48

												Considering I got this free during the whole Summer Camp ARG that Valve decided to do.  Its not bad at all.  Its actually a decent graphics throwback to the oldschool Topdown perspective Action games of the 16/32 bit era.  I really wanted to play more than 2 hours, but unfortunately I have a crappy keycard/keyboard driver and it does not allow me to press to many keys all at once: So another words I couldn't sprint, run diag, and use a health pack since it appears my keyboard has some sort of 3-4 key at a time limit.... or it was an issue mixed with this game since I have not experianced this problem before.This really limits a game like this that requires you to be mobile while shooting and pressing weapon/health/grenade keys.  I got about half way through and decided not to continue going because I was annoyed at not being able to play how I wanted.Anyways, not a bad game, fun weapons, and total old school gameplay: But without a proper way to play it I was left annoyed.

												Avoid this game like the plague. So many things wrong with this game. Primarily, the game believes in difficulty by quantity. Higher difficulties don't result in smarter mobs, they result in more mobs. Furthermore, a selling point is how you need to conserve your ammo, yet the only reason you have to do that is because the boss fights are just holding down M1 until the thing dies. There is no dodging, no countering, just spam. Also, the escort section is terrible, the plot is cliche-ridden, the camera sometimes forces you into angles where it's impossible to see where you're aiming, you can't aim properly so you waste half your ammo shooting the wall behind your target, you can't advance until prescripted events happen, and the game is riddled with ugly unskippable cutscenes right before boss fights where you always die.TL:DR: It's trash, avoid.

Entirely generic. No heart, no soul, no reason to keep playing. Upgrades are stupid, as there are multiples for each weapon, but there's no benefit to picking anything but the increased power one. Works well with a controller, and the graphics are good for this type of game, but while graphics can certainly make a good game better, they can't make a bad game good. Avoid unless you can pick up the 3 pack for less than $10 AND you love (and I mean really love) this type of game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a top down shooter that makes a solid first impression, but after a few minutes of playing you will discover that the execution of many essential elements are not very good. The game play gets repetitive rather quickly, as you frequently walk from A to b, holding down space bar to interact with switches. The gun sounds and sound effects are also rather bland. The environments are also very dark, with little variety, although the actual graphics aren't too bad.You will also battle with the camera as it sometimes switches to bizarre angels, obstructing your view to certain areas, such as the other side of a wall. There is also a load of on-screen text, so you will know right off the bat which objects are interactive, and although some people make like this. I think it does take away the discovery aspect of the game.Get this if you must but there are far batter top down shooters out there.			",1544,456,43,234,159,12,209

												Awful game design and completely broken areas make this game a MUST MISS.If you read my review of the 1st game in this series you'll know I love this game format, but even my love for this style of game can't make up for the unforgivable blunders found in this installment.It breaks my heart to give this a DON'T RECOMMEND rating, but this game is marred by several unforgivable problems :- One HUGE map is circular with platforms that change elevation as you ascend to the top.  However, the game is incapable of aiming at enemies when they are at a different elevation than you, or the map is curved. GO FIGURE  You'll die dozens and dozens of times here not because of lack player skill, but because of BROKEN GAME design.  Despite the fact that you'll have the cursor aimed directly at an enemy, every bullet you shoot will miss it as it chomps you to death.- Bad collision detection / too much clutter.  There are thousands of tiny pieces of geometry to get hung-up on. Something as simple as walking down a hallway can be a frustrating experience as your character stops dozens of time because he can't step over a piece of lint on the floor.  A game with a moving camera has to have a ""move assist"" feature to keep players gliding along, and that feature is CONSPICUOUS BY ITS ABSENCE in this game.  Grrrrr!- Unskippable cutscenes.  It's not that they're JUST unskippable, it's that they play at the most SENSELESS times.  In a game this difficult (and at times horribly broken), it is not uncommon to play the same 10-minute fight a dozen times or more.  Now imagine the frustration of dying dozens of times in a row, only you have to watch the SAME CUTSCENE each time you reload.  WHO THE HELL DID THE Q/A ON THIS GAME?This is a long enough review for a < $2 game.Even for free, and I mean for FREE this game would not be worth trying.			",132,16,5,15,7,4,16

												The second game in the Alien Breed series turns out to be a disappointment surprisingly, and I hate to say it, but I just can't recommend this version.Alien Breed 2 offers 5 new levels for Campaign single player, a new Survivor Mode, and 3 new Co op levels and 3 Survivor Co op levels. Online works well, but add friends for best results.I really enjoy the first game in this series, but was sad to see that the new ideas they used for this game turn out to be horrible decisions. I am comparing the two in this series without playing the third and in my opinion a sequel should reach the same bar of quality set by the previous version which Team 17 has certainly failed to do here.First off, they removed your favourite weapons from the first game, the Laser Rifle and the Ion Spike. You now have two new weapons which are huge letdowns. The Hyper Blaster is a high powered and fast firing minigun with a reload time that will get you killed unless you upgrade. The new Rocket Laucher is mostly useless, as we all know the massive amount of Aliens coming to kill you can not be stopped by a single rocket with a slow rate of fire and reload. You might even instant kill yourself if a tiny alien runs in front of you last second.Next, the maps are far more boring and ugly than the maps of the first game. Expect the usual backtracking with even more backtracking than ever before.You will be involved with an Escort Mission which is not that difficult but not that enjoyable either. There are some Bosses, but one of them is ruined by a horrible new camera idea.The camera now features some new angles that are forced upon you in certain maps and boss battles and this new camera is horrible. It's third person in a cramped space, and it's really difficult to aim as well as you usually can. This is not an improvement or fun in any way. I thought I was going to have to fight aliens, not the game interface...That is a LOT of negatives. I just can't find anything really positive to say about this version.I finished this game on Veteran Difficulty, and had a decent time I guess, but I can not recommend this game, especially for full price.

												The long awaited Sequel to the smash hit ‘Alien swarm’. A game so long awaited for by many games can it truly live up to the hype? Lets find outStory immersing the gamer into the game world. Leaving off from the first game, Space Sheriff Woody has crash landed on an alien world where he has to recollect his thought from the last game and bury your dead friends. Now Woody Has to deal with death and being stuck on an alien world far away from his friends and family. Will Woody be strong enough and up to the challenge to Get off the Aliens world and defeat the Alien Breeds? You decide!Game play makes a game and unfortunately this game has none of that. When you try to shoot the guy you cannot because you’re always out of bullets or you’re shooting another guy! How ridiculous! In this game you move very very slow and you cannot not run. Its like if you ate all of the cheese burgers on Jupiter! Talk about planet size problems! The game play is utter trash and it does not do good.The graphics in this game look like they came straight from the Atari 64. everyone in this game looks like Australian Cowboy Crocodile Dundo  from the game ‘Kangaroos and Kowboys’. You’re nothing but polygons in this game made of triangles. WHO MADE THESE GRAPHICOver all Gabe Noell and his team did not do such a great job with this game. Maybe next time.. Sorry gamer fans I would not Recommend.03/10			",190,15,3,24,21,1,46

												Another game another reccomendation this is actually a fun stand alone game. And it was free through the steam summer sale or acheivement tickets you can use to redeem DLC for random games or this game itself. Now im not saying its super fun nor am i saying its absolute garbage but it is a pretty good fun game. Also this is almost exactly like ""Alien Swarm"" a fairly old game now but still somewhat fun. It has co-op so you can have a bud with you or you can just play single player. So its an overhead shooter co-op or single player it has objectives etc. etc. etc. so go on ahead and get it theres not much else to do with the summer tickets so you might as well get something you can use out of it.

												The second game in Team 17's trilogic remake of their classic Alien Breed title is (like the first game) fun, good looking, and well paced. Expect suspense, stress, and a lot of alien gore. This, the second installment in the new trilogy is as good, if not better, than the first game (Alien Breed: Impact). If you like arcade style twin stick action then this is most probably a great fit for you. The game plays well with either gamepad or mouse and keyboard.			",556,225,8,106,44,3,124

												Probably not a game I would have bought had it not been a freebie in one of the steam sales, however I quite enjoyed the gameplay for a change of pace.  The control system is a little weird, WSAD to move, and mouse to aim, sounds pretty standard, except this game has an isometric viewpoint.  I ended up playing with a gamepad, where the movement was the left stick, and the aiming the right stick.  Relatively short game, but then it is basically episodic in nature.  Gameplay normally consists of following waypoints on the map to pick up an object or interact with something to open the way forward.  All the while you are dealing with relatively constant alien attacks, often a surprise attack after bursting through the wall or floor.  Weapon and equipment upgrades are available, and there are two boss fights along the way.  Not necessary to own the first game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh hello, if you read my review on Alien Breed: Impact then it’s going to be the same as the first. A great game continuing from the first, well 2 does come after 1 doesn’t it, be right back, (many hours later) after agreeing with the socks it does, don’t you talk to socks, oh… maybe it is just me.Ammo at times can be scarce and the level design well sometimes just lacking and could have been spruced up and made more varied, enemies can be bottlenecked very easily but if you liked Mass effect 3 ending Red, blue and green then you will love the green HUD than that rubbish blue one.

												Alien Breed 2 is more of the same for those coming off the heels of the first Alien Breed game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you want to know how I feel about this game in depth, check out my review for the first game, Impact.The only thing I'll add with this one is that the environment design is a bit of a letdown, as many of the areas start to feel the same after a while, and there are no cool setpieces like there were in the first game; however, there are more bosses to be found here. The climax is kind of a letdown. I wouldn't say this is a bad game, but the third installment is going to have to pull some serious muscle if it wants to make up for the slag here.More of that sweet ballet-esque gunplay in this installment, a story I honestly wasn't paying attention to, and thousands of alien corpses strewn around my feet.

												If you have the three tickets - get this game.  It's actually quite fun and addicting, especially if you have some friends to play some survivor mode and co-op assault.  The overhead controls take some getting used to, but it honestly is not too shabby of an experience!  So, I definitely and highly recommend to spend 3 of your tickets for this game and pick it up!

												As much as ive seen people loved the Alien Breed series, it was to late to go in love with this game. The games that are coming at this time of year are required way too much and they conquer a lot of people time,  but alien breed 2, it wasnt new but polished for its time really good, i would reccomend this game to people who like to just relax and have a ""Alien shooter"" type game at the moment. Ive played Alien Shooter and i adored it when i was 10 and i do agree that age does change things. I was really happy to try Alien Breed 2 out, but it wasnt what i was expecting it was just too much for me for a game that is played from the sky view point. Its good for a modern gamer but i myself isnt one that would look only at the graphics. The game itself has good graphics, amazing for its time but it had way too much things in it. I like simplier games when its a sky view point it just doesnt count as a fun game when its not simple(my own opinion).			",178,46,6,27,26,4,36

												Alien Breed 2 is a top down shooter with aliens in a decaying futuristic ship. I got this game from the Summer Sale for free like most people. The graphics are nice though a bit lacking in color. The story is continues with Engineer, Conrad, trying to escape from the ship while being with a female assistant and ghost. Intermissions presented in a comic strip fashion propel the story. The music is a fit for the game. Weapons and aliens look good but difficult to tell apart. Now, the game has some oddities. Everything explodes or during cutscenes the character Conrad falls a lot. The majority of the game is getting to point A and B and doing objectives, sometimes with a lot of backtracking. Difficulty can be hard with lots of enemies or brutal sentries. The camera can be hard to use as the angle can be changd and sometimes it does on its own. For a change the camera turns to a less top down view and to a natural view. This game by Team17 is a good reboot with modern takes.			",106,20,5,4,5,2,24
