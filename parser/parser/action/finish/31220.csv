												Usually im kinda lighthearted with my reviews on games, but not this time.This game series is, simply put, pure genius.The colorful humor, the great characters, the detailed locations, the story-rich gameplay, and much, much, more.If you don't know these guys, Sam and Max are freelance police working together through unconventional means to solve mysteries and solve crimes. The series runs in episodes, each season after season 1 has had 5 episodes in total, this being the third season. They also used to have comics, and a tv show back in the 90's.Buy this.

Brief Synopsis: The Devil's Playhouse is the third season of the Sam & Max series. It is comprised of five episodes. Sam & Max games are point and click adventures which are set in a fictional version of New York City. The games are full of slap stick comedy, word plays, and in jokes. They're simple to play, yet have a nice level of challenge to them in that the solutions to the puzzles often require doing things in a certain order. Long Review: Story: This is, in my opinion, the weirdest season of Sam & Max yet. Max has developed psychic powers from being exposed to toys from ""The Devil's Toybox"" and the freelance police duo soon find themselves the target of several different beings who want the powers for themselves. Graphics: The graphics are pretty much the same as they've been from season 1 (simple, cartoony). Any other type of style just wouldn't work well with this game, which is perfectly fine. There are very few, if any, glitches or other graphical bugs in the game.Music/Sounds: The music and sounds are what you would expect in a Sam & Max game. The music is upbeat and catchy where needed, downbeat and slow where applicable, and cheesy everywhere else. The sound effects fit into the game well and are of a decent sound level so as to not drown out the voices and background music. Length: Each episode takes around 2-3 hours to play if you're following a walkthrough. If you're playing the game purely under your own steam, then each episode will probably take you around 4-5 hours to complete. Replayability: There really isn't any replayability to this game. Once you finish it, that's it. There are no alternate endings or variations to the story. Overall, I recommend this game. The jokes are funny, the story imaginative and irreverent, and the length of each episode makes the asking price well worth it. My advice however is to purchase all three seasons in the series and play them in order as they are all a continuation of one huge story; that is, the story of the lives of Sam and Max.

												The third season of Sam & Max represents a shift in tone and gameplay. The changes are obvious from the very beginning - a narrator to set the scene, new control scheme (same as Tales of Monkey Island; clearly favouring consoles), a new villain, an opening tutorial of sorts (which is so entertaining and interactive that it puts most other tutorials to shame), psychic powers for Max and a grainier, darker graphical style. It may sound like a lot of changes to a successful formula, but it works well. Not only does it provide a quite accessible introduction for newcomers to the series (including clever little pop-up profiles of characters and notes in a journal about the case and clues), but it also provides a fresh spin on the series for veterans. Of course, the series lives or dies by the writing and puzzles, and thankfully both are still strong. The new villain, Skunkape, is wonderfully voiced and a highly entertaining character. A few old favourites are missing, while others return (as well as some who are not quite favourites; the Stinky clan seem only slightly more popular than the late, unlamented Soda Poppers…). There are some wonderful lines, with even more smashing of the fourth wall than usual – a few particularly good remarks about non-player characters, for instance. Puzzles are made a little more interesting through Max's future vision, which offers a glimpse of dialogue from a later scene. It's generally relevant to a puzzle at a particular location, and offers an idea of what to do without giving too much away. Another power, teleportation, saves a lot of the tedious trekking around, which is especially useful as load times seem a little longer than previous games. There's also a bit of a change in mindset with collecting items; they're no longer all directly used for puzzles, with some being clues to unlock new locations. Those new locations look quite similar to the old ones (lampshaded by Max), but at least offer a bit of a feeling about a wider gameworld. There's a few scripting oddities, with certain events not triggering when they are supposed to (the intended initial teleport scene, for instance, didn't come up for me until quite late in the game because I chose something they apparently didn't expect the first time), but other than that the game seems to work well. The episode is probably the most promising start to a Sam and Max season yet, and with the tease of more powers to come, and hints at future storylines, there's a lot to draw a player into the following episodes.

												(Review counted as the Complete Sam and Max Series 1,2 and 3)Really entertaining and funny point and click adventure game. Though I admit I am a bit dumb when it came to puzzles in this game...often ended up looking up guides >w>  SHHHHH! In all honesty the puzzles (basicly everything you do in the game) are all well thought out so there isn't any super unrealistic answer to a problem that hasn't been hinted slightly in the game....Like pixel searching or using items together in a way that makes no sense to solve a problem.Get it if you love point and click adventure games because this is as good as it gets!! ^.^ As long as you dont mind 15 games appearing in your games library after only buying 3.....

												Sam and Max..... oh my..... this is quite a story with a lot of cheeky jokes. If you can bear with the puzzles that range from easy to ""OMG! I've been here for hours! How do you get through the door covered in cheese?!"" then it could be quite an expirience. Make no mistake, I DO NOT recommend this game to everyone. It is a very accuired taste for a point and click puzzle game. The only pro's in my opinion being the jokes and story itself; Those jokes being some of the cheesiest I've ever heard. The puzzles have no rhyme or reason and have very little payout as they only lead to deeper puzzles and a small part of the story.In all it is a decent game and you'll get a few chuckles. However, you will have to strain for those jokes.			",110,36,1,29,4,1,14

Disclaimer: Steam only shows the play time for the first episode.Short version: 51%The last season of TellTale’s Sam & Max series improved substantially as a point ‘n’ click adventure game, but the more expensive graphics cannot hide how the writers struggled to grasp even the most basic concepts of what makes this franchise fun.Long version:The third—and so far, last—season of TellTale’s Sam & Max series, titled the Devil’s Playhouse, is almost like a typical third entry in a trilogy: instead of reusing the winning recipe yet again, it tries to experiment with bold new directions… with mixed results.The game mechanics received a serious overhaul, including controls that were designed for gamepads only, a more traditional inventory system, and the ability to freely switch between our main characters (where Max is used as sort of a pre-defined toolbox with his newfound psychic powers). Combined with the much higher budget spent on designing new environments, the Devil’s Playhouse opened up possibilities for more complex puzzles, giving us that typical classic, old-school adventure game feeling.This is also where the problem lies: it doesn’t feel like a Sam ‘n’ Max game, it plays more like a very traditional, straightforward point ‘n’ click that happens to have a talking dog and rabbit as protagonists. The nonsensical, sometimes almost downright crazy random humour that characterises this duo and the previous two seasons takes a backseat to give way to some carefully plotted, logical drama structure. There are attempts where the game tries to sell itself as a Cthulhu parody, but considering that it actually features more than one dramatic death scenes without any hint of humour or satire, it barely even scratches the minimum requirements to pass maybe as black comedy. Don’t get me wrong: as a point ‘n’ click game, The Devil’s Playhouse is incredible, one of TellTale’s crowning achievements. But as a Sam & Max game, it fails so much that I cannot recommend it to any of the fans.			",78,260,0,12,9,2,21

												Out of all three seasons of Sam & Max, this is easily the best. If you come off playing the first two season (which are great don't get me wrong) you might feel overwhelmed at first, because there's a lot of new stuff coming at you at once. There's Max's powers, new and old faces. Lots of locales (instead of just about everything happening on their own street). The story is better with this one.  It's weird and manages to hold everything together and stuff. The puzzles are btter with two possible categories of solutions, Max's powers and your regular inventory. Coming up with the right solution can be incredibly satisfying. I loved this season and was sad when it was over.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll give this game a soft recommend. Sam and Max contains a lot of humor, most of it pretty dry, but it works well for the game. The actual stories are fun and it isn't 100% straightforward so you might have some difficulty finding the answer. Note: in the game, you can actually change the amount of hints that Sam and Max give you as you play.The controls are pretty bad. This is not a deal breaker because the game doesn't rely on quick actions--far from it. But the movement of characters through the game space is pretty difficult, especially if you are only planning on using a mouse. It was slightly more palatable with a keyboard.In the end, this was just a small blip in the experience. Sam and Max is a bit of fun and I know each episode I can complete in about 2-4 hours which is nice.I would recommend not paying the full price--the collection of the five episodes is probably worth it at around $10 or less.

												What a ride.After playing all three seasons, I can definitely say that The Devil's Playhouse is the best Sam & Max experience. This season shows the heart of Sam & Max and what it's really all about. However, it's best to play the first two seasons since there are a lot of jokes and references that the player may not understand otherwise.The gameplay is like an adventure puzzle; it's a trial-and-error kind of thing, pretty much what you'd expect out of a point-and-click. Click on everything and use every dialogue option. Plus, there are many walkthroughs if you just can't progress.The humor is something you'd expect out of a decent adult cartoon. It's blunt, crude, and it's a good laugh. Plenty of suggestive innuendos and mild swears.The music isn't bad at all, but it's not praiseworthy. You won't be jamming out to the game's soundtrack, however there are tracks to fit every moment in the game, and every music piece emphasizes the task or conflict at hand. Basically, it simply gives the game more life.This is a must-have for anybody who enjoys point-and-click games! ",158,31,2,10,12,2,1

												Classic Lucasarts with a Telltale twist.Cast your mind back to the golden age of point and click adventures, the 1990s, when we had such wonders as insult sword fighting, bunnies in minefields, and psychotic rabbity things teaming up with dogs to save the world. That was where Sam & Max started and, just like those case files Max ate, that was where they stayed, forgotten, until along came a small games company called Telltale Games with new adventures for our favourite dog and psychotic rabbity thing.Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse is the third installment of Sam & Max adventures from Telltale Games, and is just as bizarre as that first outing from oh so long ago. The evil space gorilla Skunkape is hunting through the universe for the Toys of Power, demonic playthings that grant special people incredible abilities, and it is up to you, as our irksome heroes, to foil his evil plans and save the day.But never fear, you are not alone in this epic quest. As Sam so rightly points out, Max's brain is very special, which means he gets to use some of the Toys of Power. The ability to read minds, or throw his voice, even teleportation and transmutation, and more! You must bend these new powers to your will and abuse, I mean, use them to stop Skunkape and prevent him from taking over the world.Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse is, like all Talltale Games, split into five chapters, and this leads me onto my only criticism of the game. It is not possible to move from one chapter to the next without quitting the game and loading each individual chapter on it's own. Granted, it's not a big complaint, but it could have been smoother.On the whole, this was a thoroughly enjoyable game, and one I would recommend to anyone. So what are you waiting for? Grab the Corndog of Destiny by the stick and go save the world!This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												Telltale Games, always managed to make clear their goal, as the walking dead who can take those plays to tears even Sam & Max at the same time has a really engaging and full story of twists, they also have a lot of humor and those more silly to some things more politically incorrect. This is the third season of double notorious of freelances detectives where you must guide them to success in the case.Sam & Max - the devil's playhouse this is a point and click with exploration, and its theme is perhaps the one that best fits this genre. After you become part of the story, with eyes alert to any new situation or even to find objects, that way if you are not able to help them the mysteries of the game hides remained unresolved and the characters will be without goals. Thus the story die. I think I overdid it in this part, but games that majority in style can arrest me and fascinating, this case is no different. Primarily for its gameplay that is much richer than in games of this genre, full of ""magic toys"" that are for the most different purposes. For example: read minds, see the future and even teleportation.Regarding the commands they are, for the most part, simple and intuitive, just in one part or another you may have some small problem that goes for the camera rolls. However this is very little, and this fact is not enough to overshadow anything in the game. Something very interesting is the interaction between the characters where Sam (dog) comes to basic functions such as guide the way, talk to people (even if Max intrude from time to time) and Max (rabbit) to have won power ends up It is used only for their use.Things that caught my attention in particular:- Surreal History and very well produced, full of twists.- Dubbing- Humor- Scenarios- PowersIn conclusion, all of which are of the genre game fans or at least are curious. I believe all Telltale games are indispensable.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/ .Also you're welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.

												Twisted, strange, and genuinely entertaining, this is a welcome continuation of the series, with some oddly emotional moments. Expect the same kind of mind-screwing puzzles, but more perplexing and yet more reasonable than ever before. Hints generally feel organic and a natural part of conversation, and things you've likely come to expect from adventure games are ruthlessly mocked and subverted. There's really no telling where the story goes next, but when it does go there, it feels as though you really did have proper warning, and it doesn't just come out of left field. Some moments do end up turning into pixel hunting, but it's far, far more rare than other recent adventure games. The ending is, well, notable. I'd say I'm most impressed by the much different nature of Episode 2, but you'll see that when you get to it. The game certainly knows when to be serious and when to loosen up, and swings between the two at an excellent rate. In short, a truly engaging puzzle game with plenty of laughs, but keep some brain bleach on hand.			",202,57,48,14,17,5,10

												This is more of the same from Telltale games, and yet it adds in some new tricks.  The game is mostly the same point and click system the last two seasons of Sam and Max have had (And probably should be played in order) but Season 3 brings about special powers.   Max gains psychic abilities early on in the season and they keep popping up as you play the game, helping solve a number of problems. The story in season 3 is probably my favorite story out of all three seasons because it seemlessly fits together.  Where the last two seasons seem a bit disjointed (in between episodes).  In fact I really liked how this game fit together with out feeling forced.   I also think that this is probably the easiest out of the three season, but to me that's not a huge negative.  This game gives you about 16 hours of solid story, with a lot of great dialogue to fill up the time, and a number of challenging puzzles, the issue is that you have at least one power that gives you a view into the future for at least half the time, and that power is a touch powerful.  It's part of the game play so it's not cheating and it's necessary to solve some puzzles, but other times it makes it clear where you are going, and often times the challenge is more the path to get from point A to point B, rather than figuring out what point B could possibly be. The one thing I really like is all the twists in this season.  Unlike season 2 which seemed to retread a number of season 1's areas, and characters, Season 3 seems to divorce itself a bit more.  There's characters from the earlier season who seem to always be around, but in addition to characters who reappear, there's at least one major character who doesn't, and a number of new and entertaining characters.  I would say this is the strongest season but at the same time, I'd recommend anyone interested to buy all three seasons and play them in order.  I recommend this one, but I recommend all three Sam and Max seasons.  However if you only have time to play one, I might recommend the first season only because it's the beginning of the story line, but if you've ever liked point and click adventure games.   This is definitely one series you won't want to miss.			",427,129,17,51,43,6,82

												This season of Sam and Max is the best one so far. The controls are amazing, even with a PC gamepad. I love the story and the new gameplay mechanics. Even though it looks different than Sam and Max Save The World (Season 1) and Beyond Space and Time (Season 2), it still looks good. Most of the characters from previous seasons are back and the new characters are good too. I just wish that Telltale would come back to this amazing franchise. I also recommend playing the first two seasons first before playing this season.			",52,13,1,4,2,0,0

												Sam and Max, Freelance Police! ... are back in SEASON THREE.Note: You really need to play these games in order. The story builds, characters are introduced, and if you haven't played previous games, you won't understand the backstory.You can never have enough Sam And Max. However, I will say that Season 3 is the weakest of the 3 seasons. Its still good, it just isn't as good as 1 and 2. That being said, Season3 boasts a large improvement to the game graphics engine. Better models, clearer graphics, more animations and cut sequences, help the story along.I do feel like the addition of the ""Devil's Toybox"" mechanic was a bit annoying. You essentially end up with two different inventory systems - one for Sam and one for Max. It does add some depth, but can also be really annoying, since a lot of Max's abilities are PoV and it really took me out of the Adventure sort-of game when this happens.Even so, its still very funny, and if you're into adventure comedy games, it doesn't get much better. Recommended! 9.0/10			",189,37,0,17,47,0,83

												First off. the Sam & Max series deserve more credit as they are more unique and you can tell they put more time and effort into this series than most, if not all the Tell Tale games. Tell Tale took advantage of making The Walking Dead so they made a game and it got popular from the famous TV Series. After, they tried to use the same concept on Wolf Among Us, and that didn't get as popular.                         The Sam & Max series might be hard, as I have played them all multiple times to memorize, they're unique and Tell Tales greatest series. I strongly reccomend this game, and to play it from the start ""Sam & Max : Save the World.""        But sadly, if you have windows 10 like me you have to do something in the files to get the first to work.                                            *THIS IS THE THIRD IN THE SERIES*And Tell Tale and Lucasarts, if you're reading this for some reason PLEASE MAKE A SEASON 4			",42,10,0,5,3,0,0

												I love Sam & Max and have played through all seasons of this episodic game series, but I have to say, this was my least favorite of the three seasons. I found the second episode especially tedious to get through. The other thing I didn't like about this season is the introduction of the navigation where you awkwardly click the mouse button and then drag in the direction that you want Sam to go. In some of the locations, it was especially annoying to get Sam to go where you wanted him to be. I then discovered accidentally that you could also use the arrow keys to move him around and this was better, but by the time I figured that out, I was already in the habit of using the mouse. Overall, I still like this season and it certainly ended in an epic fashion, with some cool twists.			",45,43,1,3,6,0,6

												An example of the direction TellTale should return to.Easily, the best Sam & Max game, story, and probably even the best TellTale game.Everything developed in the past two TellTale seasons comes together in this amazing storyline. While the past seasons had self-contained stories each episode that converge in the finale, this season follows a more cohesive narrative, while also developing the characters that until this moment, had been very bidimensional. It even has its serious and tragic moments, while still joking around for most of the story (something that Minecraft: Story Mode should learn), without a single joke falling flat.The puzzles are more context sensitive, so it doesn't feel like they are just there to extend the length of the game, proving that TellTale is able to design good puzzles while still being able to develop the narrative. I feel the puzzles are also better designed as in, only one or two in the entire game feel like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that will make you say ""Come on! How was I supposed to figure that out!? That solution makes no sense!"", a problem that even Hit The Road had.A nice addition are Max's new psychic powers, allowing us to take control of him for the first time and do things like teleport, read minds, see the future (a hint system that doesn't make you feel dumb, as they only show you the result of the puzzle, having you (and the characters) make the deductions of HOW to get to that conclusion.So, I believe it's 9/10. So good that it made TellTale stop making graphic adventures! Seriously, this will make you feel like a detective more than A Wolf Among Us...			",58,21,3,5,4,2,2

												This 3rd season introduces a few new bits of gameplay which make a nice change to the usual collect everything not nailed down and try to use it on everything else that is nailed down puzzles. The story is excellent and very entertaining also the characters are as awesome as always but it still has the same problem of some of the puzzles being bizarrely convoluted and frustrating. Turning the hints level up doesn't help as the hints only seem to make sense if you have already worked out how to solve the puzzle. However these games are very much worth playing even if you do have to consult a walkthrough from time to time.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

												This review covers the whole of Sam and Max Season 3TL:DR: A great point and click that has made me want to buy S1 and S2 so I can enjoy Sam and Max some more.Full Version:This experience was my first with Sam and Max and I enjoyed it enough that I will definitly acquire Season 1 and 2. The game follows Sam, a suit wearing dog who is very self conscious about his weight, and Max, a crazy rabbit who has psychic powers. Both make up the Freelance Police. This game revolves around the Devils Toybox and the psychic toys which Max uses with his psychic powers which gives him abilities like teleportation and seeing the future. Its a fun point and click adventure which is made better by Sam and Max and the wacky cast of supporting characters.Good points:-Each episode is great and different enough from each other to keep the game interesting.-Sam and Max and all the other great characters are this games strong point.Bad points:- Some of the unskippable animations. When I got stuck at times Id have to keep talking to characters are investigating items to figure out the solution. However doing this sometimes has an unskippable animation and it makes the game feel a bit slow when you are stuck.			",446,133,17,76,93,4,90

In fact, my first Telltale game was Sam & Max (Full episode of abe lincoln must die) that i installed from a disk that came with one of my favorite gaming magazines, but i didn't really understood it until now.

												Some may argue that this season is even better than Hit The Road was... and in some ways, they're right!This is one of the best series to come out of Telltale, with sharp writing, great characters, and an enticing story. It's a shame it's overshadowed by the newer, 'story-rich' Telltale games, because the puzzles are pretty ingenius as well, and a bit more sensible than the earlier seasons.Plus, this season changes up the pace a lot with Max's psychic powers, and some cool other shifts in gameplay - especially the opening segment of episode 3, featuring a stellar interrogation/noir detective element. There's more variety here than any of the other seasons of Sam & Max, and those were great even with the same sort of gamplay each episode!And THIS one works on Windows 10!Definitely buy this great adventure game. (plz make season 4 telltale)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Last 5 Monthly Episodes of the Entire Sam & Max Trilogy. Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse (Season 3) delivers the best in Point & Click Adventure Games. The Devil's Playhouse features direct control and optional hotspot highlighting as well as real-time shadows. In the previous 2 seasons, the player could control only Sam, with Max roaming around, but in this season, a prominent new gameplay feature is that Max gets Psychic Powers, and to use them the player can control Max directly from a first-person perspective. Puzzles are designed to focus less on inventory use and more on applying the limited set of new powers creatively. Another new feature is that Sam has a notebook with information on the case (and your immediate goals), characters and Max's powers.Use Sam & Max's newfound Psychic Powers via the Toys of Power to battle a Host of Villians bent on destroying the Universe! The Show is about to begin in... THE DEVIL'S PLAYHOUSE!!!In Episode 1, General Skun-ka'pe (Skunkape) comes to earth looking for a future telling toy, but Max finds it first.  Now Sam & Max must defeat Skun-ka'pe after seeing a vision of the future showing his attack on Earth.In Episode 2, The year 1901, Sameth & Maximus travel to Egypt to obtain The Devil's Toybox in a movie watched by their Great Grandsons.In Episode 3, Sam attempts to recover Max's stolen brain, only to unwillingly help a pharoah unleash his own ultimate reality to the world.In Episode 4, A seemingly infinite amount of Samulacra (Sam Clones/Dogglegangers) begin attacking the city, leaving Sam & Max to stop them and discover who is the mysterious ""Clone Master"".In Episode 5; The Series Finale of Sam & Max, Sam must return Max, who since the last episode is now a Building Sized Monster AKA Maxzilla, to his normal form before he destroys the city.You can get Sam & Max Season 3: The Devil's Playhouse for the PC/Mac OS X/iPhone/iPad & on the PS3's PlayStation Store.

												I want to be able to recommend this series, I really do, but there's just too much I had problems with.  The puzzles are bad.  Yes, in this series, puzzles tend to rely on a bit of trial and error to begin with, but, with the introduction of The Devil's Toybox (a bunch of psychic items which Max can use) you essentially have twice as many options available to you at any given point in time, meaning you either have to know what you're doing, try and try and try and try until you figure it out, or rely on a guide (which is what I had to do for most of the game).  The villains aren't really as good either.  Without giving too much away, a character from the previous seasons is revealed to not be who they say they are, but it's not like its something which is explored in a whole lot of depth, just touched on in either the last, or second to last episode.  You just sorta walk past it anyway, you don't get involved.  I personally feel that one of the major antagonists, General Skun-kape (or however you spell his name) is bland, boring, and forgettable. Some other favorite characteers don't return until really late in the season as well but I won't say who.Most of all, the ending sucks.  These games are like a good joke.  The season's the wind-up, and the ending is the punchline.  Season 1 had a great and fittingly insane ending.  Season 2, while not as good, was still pretty okay.  This one though made me groan, roll my eyes, and want to never play again.  I just don't think its as fun so, unless you're a hardcore fan of the series or really want to see how it all ends, skip it, and let Season 2 stand as the ending.			",51,16,0,8,10,1,6

												Don't you hate it when you reserve something and the girl at the store counter is like ""oh yeah we  got the reservation but we don't have your thing"" and you're standing there like ""yeah but I RESERVED it, that means you RESERVE one for me"" and she is like ""yes I know, we did reserve it, but we don't have it"" and then you try to explain that taking reservations isn't the same thing as holding reservations, and she just brushes you off and gets the manager, and you go through the whole spiel all over again with the manager?  Oh yeah, Sam & Max is ok I guess, I didn't actually play this game though.			",178,24,3,34,6,1,16

												I really loved the S&M Seriese ever since a friend came over and showed my Abe Lincoln must die.I loved it so much i went ahead and purchased all of them.Season one was excellent, season two was just as good, but episode 3....... wasn'tIt wasnt that it was different, but it was Waaaay too different.-It wasnt as funny-it was more like one long and split apart movie than an episodic one      And what i mean is that in the other ones you could play all of them pretty much out of order and still have hun. but                 this one you cant-It was..... strange       I felt relitevely comfertable playing season 1 and 2 around my family who also love S&M, but Season 3 was a bit too strange for me-And lastly was the entire storyline I really despised having to use Max's ""Powers"" and the very stupid ""Toys of power""NVM thatI hated those ""Toys of power""I think it waa the worst thing about the gameIt's such a stupid idea that max can use random toys to gain powersAnd they made such a big deal about them tooEvery 2 minutes someone has to say the words ""Toys of power""Anyway, enough of my rantingI at least liked the episode where they use the slideshow projectorIt was a cool concept in my opinionAnd it was really the only one that i found fun    (Aside from the persistant ""Toys Of Power"" plot)Also the ending was actually quite sad. Some tears were almost shedmostly for the obvious reason, but also because i played an entire season without once seeing Bosco :(Also i loved the Snucky's cameo inside Max's ""Inventory room""I would reccomend this game only to get the last bit of story from sam and maxbut other than that i dont really reccommend it ",116,21,1,9,5,0,1

												Say what you will about Duke Nukem Forever, but at least it didn't compromise the original off-color world of Duke to appease the self-appointed Arbiters of Morality at the ESRB. E-rated Sam and Max is like X-rated Disney, except without the lasting cultural impact of seeing Eeyore stuff himself into Princess Jasmine's gaping♥♥♥♥♥♥ The only reason to bother with this dull exercise in mediocre voice acting, tepid writing, and simplistic yet tedious puzzles vanished once they stopped giving the TF2 preorder bonus.

												Season 1 & 2 were good, but season 3 adds new game mechanics, improved conversation tool (which makes it clear when you've reached the end of a line of questioning) and generally a wider variety of locations and content. All this is mixed with classic Sam & Max humour - Awesome! :-)			",165,71,0,8,11,4,16

												This is more dramatic than Season 1 and Season 2, and it has a different interface (some would say it's an easier game). It's still Sam & Max, but this time around, it's a beautiful, gradually escalating story with lots of spoofy things instead of being a pure spoof.Regardless, the humor is excellent, and while I would recommend playing Season 1 and Season 2 first for continuity reasons, I like this one better than both of them. And while you might miss some in-jokes, you won't be completely lost if you start here.The Devil's Playhouse as a whole is pretty much one of my favorite entries in the entire adventure game genre.

PLayed Season 2 and then Season 3 back to back and it was alot of fun/ Season 3, they really twisted it all around and made it very exciting and left you wondering what was gonna happen next. puzzles were cool, graphics were good, and some of the puzzles were pretty challenging. Would definitely reccommed this game along with Seasons 1 & 2.Hope they make more, but haven't heard anything good about that.			",128,78,0,14,16,0,24

												FIrst off, I am not simply reccomending just the 3rd season of Sam and Max, I reccomend the ENTIRE series.Sam and Max games are fill to the brim with humor and 'logic'In this game you need full intuition, you need to find out dialogues and read inbetween the lines. Each game gives an example of it. Especially Devils Playhouse!In the 3rd season of S&M, Max gains psychic powers, making gameplay more interesting. You can teleport, read minds, transform, see the future, throw your voice in objects, shrink into a ""Can O' Nuts"", and use a cool robot with 'lazerz an♥♥♥♥♥♥I am sure people really enjoy this game, but it can also be very infuriating!

												I only got into this game because not only did Humblebundle do a promotion (which is still ongoing. You can get 6 Telltale series' for $1 or more donation. Go grab it while you can), but I had some time with Sam and Max in Poker Night at the Inventory 2. I find this game surprisingly very funny, when at first I assumed it would be child humor and would be something I didn't find entertaining. But in all aspects, I love this and it definately feels different from a regular Telltale game (like Tales from the Borderlands) because there are more than just the base things you can do in the game. Max has different powers and I like trying to piece together a solution for situations.			",105,23,3,21,5,3,5

												The Devil's Playhouse was my first experience with Telltale and the Sam & Max franchise. I haven't played their Walking Dead games, but The Devil's Playhouse was a great way to make a good first impression for me.Amusing oddball character with just the right amount of give-and-take in the dialog to keep everything feeling punchy. Use of some interesting mechanics involving the toys themselves that made it fun to solve. Having played the other Telltale S&M games since then, others may find the departure from the formula a little offputting, but all in all it was a game that was handily capable of keeping my interest and eagerly awaiting the next chapter's release.

												The Sam & Max games keep going from strength to strength. Season 3 is the best season so far, and features Max's psychic powers as a running theme. You get new combinations each episode to keep things fresh, as well as significantly improved graphics. Writing is better too, as TellTale now have hired some of the people who once worked at Lucasarts, at the golden age of adventure games. If you ever loved the classic adventure games, or were curious what it was all about, please by the Sam & Max seasons, especially season 3. The puzzles are challenging without being frustrating. Adventure games live again, and they are at least as good as they used to be. They deserve a bigger audience. Get it!			",327,301,2,86,66,3,88

Tears of Sorrow and of Joy.After playing through all of the episodes I grew to love both Sam & Max and any game that can connect with me on that level and make me care about the characters (enough to cry), is a HUGE THUMBS UP, in my book.Get the whole series and play them all through, you will love the hilarity of it all and from time to time get annoyed that you can't figure stuff out, but it's all worth it in the end for the ending that made me cry!

												Sam & Max Devil's Playhouse is the third season of Telltale's modern series of Sam & Max point'n'click adventures games. This one was coming out at around 2010. Yea, you still can't die or get stuck there, no worries.Unlike Season Two, this season actually improves a lot in all aspects. Or at least when it comes to narrative, graphics and gameplay. Music is great as always. Or dull, depends on taste. And it shows that it's more modern game, with more cinematic camera angles for example. Also should thank more console-like controls for this where you will have to drag your mouse. Also, nice to have graphics that support more or less precise shadows instead of just dark circle under characters.Narrative itself is also great. It doesn't feel like it uses episodes for budget reasons, you will exploring a lot new locations in each episodes. Well, almost. Though you may miss checking out Sybil all time, but oh well. For plot itself, well, let's just say that it mixes dark tones into this comedy. It actually does a great balance between serious and funny, you will be smiling and engaged.Also, no Soda Poppers!Gameplay also got improved. Max isn't as usual as he was in previous games, as now he got physics powers. To abuse. And each episode varies things up gameplay-wise as well, without going down to mini-games, staying in point'n'click adventure system. There even was fun interogation scene. Or having to use mind-reading. Or checking future vision to find out what you should try to do. No worries, Future Vision is part of puzzles, not hints system.The thing is that it's still an old-school puzzle at the core, which may put off some people off in these modern times. It still has mindset where it doesn't matter what you say and there are no bad or good decisions. You just have to put things into motions, where each situation is puzzle by itself, with no care for consequences. And puzzles solutions may still be way too weird.Then again, I did manage beat the game without hints and without walkthrough, while getting stuck here and there for few minutes. It's not as bad as some ""classics"". Or maybe I just got experience with this genre, don't know exactly. But hey, the hint system is still in place, so you should be able to pull throughw ithout going to Google.Devil Playhouse is nice combination of old-school with modern technology. It improves things much more than Season Two and it's great by itself.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												This is a game starring a talking detective dog and an insane, hyper violent rabbity thing that is also president. The stone head of Abraham Lincoln is a character in this franchise, and he's married to the Queen of Canada. This chapter is called the Penal Zone for god's sake, and eventually the characters themselves become sick of the jokes about it. This is bats**t loopy nutterness at it's absoloute best, with clever writing, constant jokes, and one of the most insane plots in gaming.

												Sam & Max gets darker in this third season. Each episode takes on a different storytelling genre like sci-fi, adventure, and Lovecraftian horror, but still packed with the witty banter and puzzles of previous Sam & Max games.The first thing I should point out are the controls. Rather than clicking on where you want Sam to go like in Seasons 1 and 2 (and pretty much every other P&C Adventure), you click and drag, essentially creating an analog stick with your cursor. Oh, and Max has psychic powers now. New to S&M (wait, that sounded wrong) are toys. No seriously. Now Max can teleport (but only to people's telephones that he has the number to), there's a ViewMaster that lets him see the future, and a ventriloquist dummy that lets him throw his voice. But some other people are after The Devil's Toybox, and it evolves into something bigger than in the previous seasons.If you've already enjoyed the previous S&M games, pick this one up and finish the trilogy.

												I got the first season of Sam and Max games from their site, borrowed a disk copy of season two from a friend, and bought the third season on Steam, and I have to say, these games are completely off their rocker. The fact that I can't presently think of any game franchise more random, more sarcastic, and more flat-out insane than this one definitely says something. Everything from Jamaican seahorse monkeys to time-travelling mariachis in space. I... there are no words. Well, there are some words, in that I should warn you that these are point-and-click adventure puzzle games, and you'll probably have to look at YouTube videos to progress at some points, unless you're something of an intuitive genius. You know that feeling, when you think of a perfectly good solution to a problem, but it isn't specifically the one that the game is looking for, so it rejects it? Get used to that feeling while playing these games. But it is WELL worth it, trust me. Techno vampire agrees.			",74,16,0,10,5,2,5

												The first season was fun if a bit low-budget, the second season managed partially to get to Day of the Tentacle-quality heights but this third season is just pure damned awesomeness! It's not particularly challenging or gamey, but it's totally entertaining storytelling/watching and all the timebending plot twist stuff is some of the most absurd I've seen in a while. Great writing and great voiceacting! I'd recommend going through the previous seasons first to get the most kick out of the recurring gags and characters. Also it's gamepad friendly so I guess it'd work nicely with the Big Screen thingie...			",554,177,10,94,66,6,114

												Buy all three seasons. At the very least, buy season 2 and 3.Season 1 (Save the world) starts out good, then becomes slow, gets good again at 104, and wears out its welcome by 106.Season 2 (Through time and space) is consistently funny and interesting, with snappy dialogue and some really great jokes, as well as a few clever puzzles.Season 3 (The devil's playhouse) though they've changed the controls from point and click to something much more fiddly, looks better than ever, has some genuinely brilliant and affecting bits, a ton of great jokes, and plenty of neat puzzle solutions.In a way similar to MSPA, the callbacks and references to prior episodes just get more frequent as the games go on. And the games themselves just keep getting better.			",159,59,1,57,30,5,57

												Warning: You must buy all the episodes of the The Devil's Playhouse or your missing the entire game. Telltale has gotten better at telling stories. But that is all this game is, a story with a few puzzles. Chances are you wont play this game through more than twice. But at least it will be entertaining.If your the kind of person who likes puzzles with a storyline, get this game. If your not a puzzle solving kind of person. Then don't get the game. You can just watch the playthrough on youtube.I had fun with it but I don't plan on playing it more than once. The humor is good and has lots to make you think over.

												I feel that this is the strongest of the comedy-oriented Telltale adventure games (a catgory that includes almost everything they made up through Back to the Future, and a category I much prefer to the style they've been pursuing since Walking Dead). The quality of the writing, the game design, and the production values, all of which had been on an upward spiral since 2005, peaked here. Play this game.If you liked any of their other games from this period (Sam & Max seasons 1-2, Strong Bad's, Wallace and Gromit, Tales of Monkey Island, or Back to the Future), then play this, because it's even better. If you haven't played any of those games but like point-and-click adventure games, then start here and then move onto those other games if you're charmed by the style.If you've never played a point-and-click, here is a good place to start. These Telltale games have simpler, more intuitive puzzles than the 90s Lucasarts/Sierra games, making them a good deal more accessible.Don't worry if you haven't played the first two seasons- the story in this season is pretty independent of those. Parts of the setting may come off as nonsequiturs (why is Max president? why are there two Stinkys and what the hell is the girl one supposed to be? why is Mama Bosco a ghost? what's with the giant stone Lincoln head and why is this Sybil character married to it? why does nobody comment on any of these outlandish things?), but quite frankly the plot explanations from the first two seasons are generally irrelevant to the plot from this season and are always totally ridiculous anyway so who cares.

												Sam & Max: The Devils Playhouse is a fine example of a ""Pointy, Clicky Puzzler."" A nice looking art style, a ""different"" type of humor, and many memorable lines make this game a rather nice game to have. On the flip-side, this game is not for the puzzle hater and the game has obvious over-use and uncreativity of models. Yes, I am talking to you, Max-Cow, that looks just like a painted version of Bessie from the earlier seasons! But over all, the game is a great game, and it shines over its two previous seasons.

PLayed Season 2 and then Season 3 back to back and it was alot of fun/ Season 3, they really twisted it all around and made it very exciting and left you wondering what was gonna happen next. puzzles were cool, graphics were good, and some of the puzzles were pretty challenging. Would definitely reccommed this game along with Seasons 1 & 2.Hope they make more, but haven't heard anything good about that.			",128,78,0,14,16,0,24

												This game is just gold coin worthy. (yes I said that)It doesn't matter what kind of gamer you are... You could be a casual gamer, a fighting game guy, a shooter guy, or even a non-gamer in general. I TOTALLY recommend this game to everyone. This is a must play.			",22,4,0,3,2,2,0

												The sam and max games at least for the Devil's Playhouse was fun lighthearted entertainment. There are a few times you can die or be forever stuck so watch out for those. There were also several times I had to reload because of a glitch where a largebutton that looked like a smoke alarm sat stuck in the middle of my screen. Other than these problems game was enjoyable. Lasted about 3-4 days of light play to finish them all and I dont foresee much replay. Definately something to try on steam share or maybe get it while it is on sale.			",105,9,0,8,9,1,6

												(Note) This review im doing here doesnt show my exact time of me playing the whole season 3 or the rest of the sam and max games since you can only review by episode and since episode 1 is where everyone is gonna be looking for reviews im going to do only one kind-of-quick review here.Personally season 3 ""The Devil's Playhouse"" is the best season of the telltale sam and max series.While Sam and Max Hit the Road by Lucasarts is the 2nd best in the series.Recomend getting the telltale sam and max games when they are on sale since the price is very steep.Sam and Max started off as a comic book series in the 80s that got its own adventure game by Lucasarts to even a pretty good short lived cartoon show its become a pretty big cult hit with adventure gaming fans for its own unique style of comedic and sometimes noir crime story telling while still apealing to both kids and adults.If your one of those people who are bad at Adventure games and never get guidance or big hints then you can turn the hint feature on in this game to give you a bit of hand holding or reminders of what to do and dont worry the game will not punish you for having the feature on plus the feature is on by default so you can turn it off in the option's menu at anytime.

												I think what I love most about Sam & Max games are it's simplicity.  Unlike many adventure games where you have ""Look"", ""Use"", ""Touch"", etc. commands.  All you get to do is click on something or use an item on something.  This latest series goes a bit further and give Max psychic powers to use.  It's still simpler than most adventure games though, and I really appreciate that.  Even though the gameplay is simple, it was still tough for me to figure out some puzzles.  Granted, some of the solutions doesn't sit right with me, but most of it does.I think the story is great too, except for the ending.  It's just too anticlimatic.			",32,15,0,8,6,0,2

												Another solid Sam and Max season.  Great presentation via an Alfred Hitchcock-esque narrator and some cool new gameplay elements.  As a whole season, I thought season 3 was the best overall.  Best episode still belongs to 105 Reality 2.0, followed closely by 205: Chariot of the Dogs.  My next favorite episdoe comes from 302: They stole Max's Brain.  Any fan of point and click adventures, Lucas Arts adventure games, or good comedy games should play all three of these seasons, they are all very well done and very much worthe the playthrough.

												The first season was fun if a bit low-budget, the second season managed partially to get to Day of the Tentacle-quality heights but this third season is just pure damned awesomeness! It's not particularly challenging or gamey, but it's totally entertaining storytelling/watching and all the timebending plot twist stuff is some of the most absurd I've seen in a while. Great writing and great voiceacting! I'd recommend going through the previous seasons first to get the most kick out of the recurring gags and characters. Also it's gamepad friendly so I guess it'd work nicely with the Big Screen thingie...			",554,177,10,94,66,6,114

												Pretty good Point-and-Click Adventure game series. Voices, graphics, writing, and comedy is good. Each episode takes about 3-5 hours, depends on if you have hints on, trying to hear all the dialog, etc. But this season seems really easy (even with hints off). Also I don't really like how they have a radial menu for choosing answers, you sometimes choose the correct answer, without hearing the wrong answers.			",1131,344,37,145,99,10,218

												I'm a big Sam and Max fan. That much speaks for itself (or doesn't). You don't need to know a lot to get into the third season of the series (This is the third season, even if it doesn't say it) and this is the kind of series that can do something like that successfully. There are a lot of in-jokes that you would miss by doing so, but after you play this game and compare it to the rest of the series... it's a little difficult to go back.The graphics are greatly improved from the earlier games as are the animations, the sarcastic/satirical/over-the-top comedy is still here in full force, and the twists keep coming. The series also manages to become darker and more twisted the further you go in, which is a feat if you've ever played/read/watched Sam and Max and see how dark it normally is.I should have recommended this earlier when it was about 8 bucks really, because even if you were broke (like I was) it's worth that sort of money.
