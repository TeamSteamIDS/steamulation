												Data Jammers: FastForward is a decent arcade game that can be finished in less than an hour. There's not a whole lot here, although anyone who enjoys seeing their name at the top of online leaderboards might like this.Data Jammers is a simple game: you steer a little vehicle along a a colorful track, picking up scoring orbs, avoiding obstacles, and grabbing powerups like shields and bombs that can be used to destroy enemies. Score lots of points, don't die, and you'll see your name up in lights on the leaderboards.That's all there is to do with Data Jammers: FastForward. And with only about 15 total levels, you'll do it all really quickly. The controls are tight and the action is fast, so at least the whole thing works the way it should.If you really want to play Data Jammers: FastForward, wait for a sale.			",908,212,81,89,94,14,172

												Data Jammers is a fast paced, arcade-style game where you drive along a track, avoiding obstacles and aiming for powerups. I came in with low expectations after having played Brainpipe, and I was right not to expect much.As with Brainpipe, most of the game's skill depends on twitch reflexes. You're given some warning with the faster obstacles, but not enough to avoid hitting them. At other times, I simply became trapped by the obstacles and had no choice but to hit them. Some will actively try to kill you. Even on the lowest difficulty, they're tough to deal with when the game moves so quickly. You can fire a weapon, but you only get three shots. I spent most of my time frustrated. This game at least seems to have more depth than Brainpipe.It's still not any fun, though, and I couldn't recommend it when there are better free games on Kongregate. Don't buy this one.

												Data Jammers: FastForward is a computer themed arcade style game where the player controls a ""Data D.O.O.D"" though a racetrack full of hazards and opponent in order to hack into ""Ouroboros"" Watching this video, the game seemed fun and something about it reminded me of playing arcade games when I was young. Despite wanting to like this game, I cannot recommend it. Like many computer themed game, this game has nothing to do with actual computers and is only there to facilitate a convenient Tron-like art style. Zipping along the racetrack as such is fun at first but quickly loses it's luster and ultimately feels a bit like a gimmick. Where this game fails is the fact that it's procedurally generated and that it throws everything at you. As a result playing this game is a bit of a chaotic mess which puts you in situations that often feel unfair.  I feel this game could have been better with intentionally designed challenges instead of throwing the player into a sloppy mess. The game does support USB controllers fairly well. If you're looking for a challenging (and sometimes unfair) arcade game that you can play with a USB controller than this might be a good title but don't expect too much.Score: 5.5/10 ",509,60,3,44,29,0,78

												In game you are auto running like most of STG. You can use slider get out of the red way and dodge attack from enemy, green way give you some support or points.  ""A""  buttom to destroy the enemy near you.I gave a ""nagitive"" to recommend it because I think this game is not so much fun in my personal opinion.I think this game could be better, such as adding some shooting elements that will make it not so drab.=======================================支持手柄，在高速路上躲来躲去，绿色的线路有加血或者护盾，可以震开贴身的机器人，第一关boss是个打钉机，没什么难度。游戏类型属于四不像，就是个躲来躲去的反应游戏 ，要是添加射击元素也耐玩些，像pressure这种带射击的竞速游戏（其实也不是竞速）。个人感觉挺无聊的一个游戏，没有亮点，出于个人喜好，不推荐。			",679,285,21,141,83,4,110

												Data Jammers: Fast Forward, as its name imply, is a fast paced action arcade game that is very similar to audio surf in style. In Data Jammers: Fast Forward you travel on a high-speed digital highway collecting ring like object for points while dodging and destroying enemy vehicles that include strange flotation devices and bizarre cars; you get points for doing any of these things. The game is very fast paced, and your success is highly dependent on how fast your reaction time is. Data Jammers: Fast Forward is challenging that’s what makes it fun, however, the levels are extremely repetitive. There is quite a bit of enemy variety but after a few hours everything seems to blend in and the enemies you use to find challenging becomes a rather chore to kill. The sounds effects and musical score are boring and the boss fight isn’t all that inspiring or difficult. This is an average indie game.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												It's very difficult to give this game a ""Yes"" or a ""No"" vote, I'm a litte bit on the fence with this one.There is very little in the way of tutorial. AKA They introduce a new enemy every so often. It's a fairly simple control scheme, anyways. you can use the arro keys to move. My HUD indicated that I had 3 lives, and 3 nukes, so I tested the space bar and it does an Area Damage attack - a nuke. sure. There are health pickups along the way. I was bout to give this a neg score, as you only get 3 nukes per level, and nuke is your only weapon. It's very difficult to get enemies to collide to kill each other. It took me until the 3rd boss to realise that some of those Health pickups aren't giving me any health... they are actually Nukes - there are two kinds of pickups. Because you 'can' replenish your weapon, I no longer feel it deserves that No vote.It's a very fast paced game, and much of the time, until I discovered the replenshible weapon, at least, I felt I had very little control over what was going on - specifically, defending myself. The game mechanics are solid, the gameplay looks good, even if some of the story seems flimsy, it has a leaderboard, which I tend to do better on when I die, rather than complete a level, There is nothing ""Wrong"" with this game, so i can't give it a 'no' vote. is it worth the $1.99? well, for about an 1 1/2 hour of gameplay in story mode, considering that a movie is $18 for the same entertainment value, I say it's actually a good little buy.Basically it's almost a little gem. It feels almost old school arcade, but with the twisting 3D mapped roadspace, bringing the feel up to date, rather than the 2D top-down road racer that this game really is.

												Like Digital Eel's previous titled, Data Jammers is easy to get into, with a simple control scheme, but the twisting raceway that splits and merges complicates a race to collect powerups and avoid enemies that dearly want to play bumper cars. While there are power-ups that allow you to directly fight back, the best approach is almost always to use your maneuverability and the neutral vehicles that litter the raceway to avoid or eliminate your attackers.I'm a little disappointed that the soundtrack is so understated-- coming from their previous obstacle racer Brainpipe, I was expecting much louder and surreal background music. Perhaps there's a glitch at the moment. The HUD is simple but poorly described; after several levels worth of play, I still haven't got used to keeping track of shield and life totals with it.

												FastForward as an action game:FastForward is a fine game with pretty, trippy audiovisuals and solid gameplay (which justifies the purchase enough for me). The stages are semi-randomly generated and quite varied. My biggest complaint is that the game is too short - after around 3 hours of playing, the only thing left in it for me is improving my scores and grinding for Packet Loss achievement, none of which is the kind of fun I tend to enjoy.FastForward as an arcade game:I find the rules too random for an arcade game.Scoring high seems to be based on memorization to a surprising extent but a lot of tactical / reflex-based action and randomness / luck still remains in playing for high scores.I miss an endless arcade mode in FastForward.I found keyboard more efficient than Xbox 360 Controller.FastForward reminds me of Snail Mail (a lot) and Leave Home (a bit).

												Data Jammers: Fast Forward is a surfing arcade game similar in many respects to Audiosurf in terms of the presentation.  The game has a distinctly TRON like vibe and  the techno music helps to complement the ambience.  Built in support for the gamepad as well as online score ranking are both welcome as is the support of both the Steam Overlay and widescreen modes.  The game can be quite challenging , so casual players may find it a bit frustrating but competitive arcade gamers may enjoy the later difficulty.  I found this to be an enjoyable game and would recommend it to any enthusiast of arcade action particularly those with controllers.			",1052,329,48,158,114,10,216

												This game is a pretty fun arcade dodgem kinda thing.  Though wireframe, the graphics look relly nice and smooth, and they have done a good job of making it feel relly fast and intense.The game is pretty short, but hey: $2 something?  Would have poured more than that into a machine at the arcade if I just played a few levels.Oops, showing my age there.  For the whipper snappers out there: an arcade was a place you went to in a mall or shopping center where you could play games by putting coins into the machines.  Now GET OFF MY LAWN!!Anyway, my only complaint about the game would be that they slowly introduced all of the bad guys, but then there no level where you actually deal with all of them.Worth the money though.
