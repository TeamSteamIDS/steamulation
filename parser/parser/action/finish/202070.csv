												Choplifter HD is only recommendable to people who don't mind a severe ""old school"" challenge. Everyone else will probably find the game too frustrating, even on the lower difficultly levels.Like the 1980s original, Choplifter HD puts you in control of a helicopter and tasks you with rescuing people and bringing them back to safety. Enemies dot the levels and they'll take shots at you; if your helicopter takes too many hits you'll blow up. Likewise, if you run out of fuel, you'll crash. Choplifter HD becomes a game of risk management; do you have enough fuel to make it to the next person who needs to be rescued, or should you turn back to refuel and repair first? The clock is ticking...All of this is fine, and is keeping in the spirit of the original game. Where Choplifter HD veers off-course is in the difficulty: this game is tough as nails. The first two or three levels are easy enough, but the difficulty spikes severely from that point on. Levels are jam-packed with enemies that can take your health down in a flash and many of them re-spawn after a short time, meaning you have to deal with them over and over. Enemies with RPGs and EMP rifles that stand on rooftops are very hard to spot, and later on you'll have to avoid missiles fired from jets as well as incoming mortar fire. There are even tanks and AA cannons that can take you out in a couple of hits. It's almost impossible to avoid taking damage in Choplifter HD, so get used to restarting some levels multiple times before you finally conquer them.If the campaign becomes too much to take, Choplifter HD also has a zombie mode: here, you fly back and forth across a besieged city, shooting zombies and rescuing people. It's fun for a while.One other thing worth mentioning: the awful voice-acting. Throughout Choplifter HD, you'll be treated to poorly-written and voiced jokes and one-liners from your chopper's crew. None of the jokes are funny, and they're repeated over and over. Some of the dialog is surprisingly tasteless too. Turn your speakers off. If you're one of those people who think that modern games have become too ""casual"", then Choplifter HD is for you.			",908,212,81,89,94,14,172

												Choplifter HD is a spiritual successor of the original Choplift on Apple II. The mechanics are simiar, but updated. The chopper is in 2D space: it can go left, right, up and down. It can turn left, right, or face the player (out), and this is important as enemies do come from 3 directions (left, right, and out). And you can't hit the enemy if you're facing the wrong way. The game is presented in 3D with parallax and real scrolling to give the impression of 3D but the actual movesments are 2D. Different helicopters have different handling, such as firepower, speed, carrying capacity, fuel capacity, and so on. Armed helis have missiles and/or chain gun, and all helis need to rescue people (civilians or soldiers or even the occasional news crew).  As you play you will unlock better helos by achieving ""stars"" on the missions. Enemies have AAA gun sites, soldiers with AK, soldiers with RPG, SAM sites, technical (gun trucks), APCs, tanks, enemy heli, enemy jets, and just general terrain obstructions. Your objective is basically to rescue as many people that needs to be rescued as possible by flying there, kill enemies in your way, land next to the people (not ON them!) so they get on, then fly back to your base, drop them off, and repeat until either time runs out, or you rescued them all and/or other missions. It can get frantic, when you have enemies on all sides, missile lock on you, and so on. In many ways this is a twin joystick shooter, as the left stick controls the chopper while the right stick controls the aim (laser sight pointing the chain gun). Fuel is limited, and any use of ""turbo"" (speed boost) eats up fuel like crazy. And your helo won't fly without fuel. Rockets are limited in qty and reloaded only at base. Chaingun is infinite but there's a heat limit to prevent it from firing too much. Carrying capacity is limited  and the larger choppers don't fly as fast or move as nimbly as the smaller ones. On the other hand, they can often do everything in one trip rather than taking multiple trips. There are various ""campaigns"" containing various missions, and each mission usually has a bonus objective as well as news crew to rescue (2 extra people!)  DLC packs adds extra helos to play with (some are very powerful) and more missions. All in all, it's a fun little game, worth successor to the name.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												Having played the original in the late 80's as a kid in amusement arcades, it was hard to resist purchasing this very addictive game.  It's worth purchasing the Night Avenger dlc helicopter as some missions are quite difficult to get a perfect 5 stars.  The more stars you acquire the better helicopter upgrade you receive, you have to use non dlc helicopters to complete a mission before being able to use any powerful dlc helicopters you may have purchased.Zombie! Zombie! Zombie! dlc level pack is worth buying also but not necessary to complete the game.You can easily play this game off onboard Intel HD Graphics 3000 very well, the graphics are superb.  Bought in the Christmas 2013 steam sale with 75% off.			",180,24,7,16,10,1,19

												I really wanted to love this game, and as I was a huge fan of the old Choplifter I bought it. The graphics are great but the learning curve is just too steep. Enough folks complained that the makers ""dumbed it down enough that a 12 year old girl"" could play it, to quote them. I still can't get past level three, and in frustration, after buying downloaded DLC helicopters to just see and enjoy this game, I threw my hands up in disgust. I bought it, I wanted to experience it, but this is another instance when the creators don't understand their audience. When selecting easy doesn't make a game easy, there is no sense in it. I am not trying to master some great adventure quest, I am trying to blow off some steam and relax. This game is beautiful, and captures the essence of the original very well, but is too hard for all but the serious gamer, and you will wind up frustrated and give up, just as I did. SKip this game in my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very much a game for the Choplifter enthusiast, this game is what a ""sequel to a classic"" should be. It reproduces the tone, gameplay, and atmosphere of the original arcade classic in a very meaningful way, without introducing obscure ""new"" mechanics that detract from the theme or feel of the original. Mind you, the original was controller-breakingly difficult, and Choplifter HD is no different: the gameplay is simple yet exceptionally challenging. Since the graphics are simple and the gameplay is ""old fashioned"" , I can't recommend this to newer gamers; however if you are a retro junky or a fan of the original, then Choplifter HD is a Must Buy.

												Choplifter HD is the return of the classic video game that many of us used to play on Apple, Atari or our gameboy (+ more). Its return should hold a special place in every gamers' heart as its modern rendition still gives us hours of fun and humor. Choplifter HD should not be passed up by any casual gamer and is great for Steam achievers.			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												Why this scores so low on Metacritic is probably an issue of nostalgia for the old game, which was more physics oriented rather than action oriented. In truth, this is a solid and entertaining ""coffee-game"" pick-up-and-play action game with a forgiving learning curve, pretty visuals, and fun gameplay. Best taken in small doses, however, since the captives who like to run under your landing skids or into the path of your tail rotor can turn your mood from catharsis to frustration-induced homicide pretty quickly.

This game is trully fun to play, will keep you entertained thouroughly, and won't frustrate you when you fail. You unlock better choppers and replay levels until you're satisfied. The graphics are surprisingly advanced and the side-scrolling gameplay proves to be very addictive. Overall this game is complete in it's superb gameplay and eye-catching graphics.			",6,1,0,0,1,0,0

												 I picked this up because it looked fun and was on a good sale. I never played the original but this game is FUN. It's really different as far as gameplay goes, I can't think of anything else similar out there.  It does have a few quirks and flaws but for straight up arcade helicopter action I love it.  The levels are very detailed and except for the zombies the missions are quite immersive. Luckily there is a really easy mode that will still let you pass levels you cannot beat on other difficulties at first, because some of them are REALLY challenging.  I would say 7.5/10..

												This version of the masterpiece legendary game is off the charts fun. It's every bit as exciting to play as any of the top titles available at this moment. Once you get used to the flight controls, it just gets easier and more fun. For a real good time without having to be so concerned with such distractions as getting energy credits (as in a game like Star Trek Online) or paying through the nose with DLC, you earn the upgrades by playing instead of buying them with hard earned dollars.For such a simple game, it should win some awards or at least get more recognition.

												Choplift is rooted HEAVILY in the shoes of the original game which I played back in the Commodore 64 days, and for that nostalgia value alone I had a blast playing.  This update adds some new variety of missions and a boatload of graphical and narratives additions, but the core game is rooted to the concept that made Choplifter an enduring favorite all those years ago... though whether you enjoy this may depend heavily on whether you actually are old enough to have cut your teeth on these types of games.  If you are this is definitely worth $10, and if not it's easily worth $5 to try it for awhile.My 2 complaints: Some of the mid to late missions need knife-edged precision to beat which can be frustrating old-school style, and it's made worse by the fact that the DLC choppers (which effectively enable a God-mode ability) can only be used once you beat the mission in standard mode.  Secondly the narrative humor is usually groan-worthy at best and HORRIBLY IRRITATING at worst.			",385,63,18,9,25,1,53

												Pretty fun game that's essentially a revamped version of the classic Apple II game. Although it's good, many of you will probably think that $15 is slightly too high a price for a ""timewaster"" game, despite how much time you may or may not sink into it. So yeah, probably either wait for a sale to put it down to $10 or less, or get a coupon for it; that way you'll probably be happy about the purchase no matter how much time you spend on it!(Although keep in mind that the developers were slightly exaggerating about the number of helicopters available, as there are only three different helicopters, but each have weapon/fuel/defence upgrades, with a different colour scheme for each set/unlock that you get)			",231,38,10,53,38,2,64

												I played this on commodore 64, and this new version plays pretty much exactly the same. I even had the same problem squishing the people I was trying to save.Super fun arcadey style twin stick shooter, but I wouldn't pay more than $5 and the dlc isn't worth the price being as how stuff like that should have been in the game anyway. If it goes on sale it's fun and worth the price.			",488,97,11,36,33,6,68

												This is Choplifter. The pedigree shines here...you can still feel that chopper move almost the same way it did back on the Apple II all those years ago. While the gun controls take some getting used to, and can be not fun sometimes...overall, this game is an A+ winner for me. Choplifter has always been simple in the basic premise. This latest entry takes it up a notch or three. Play. It. Now.			",165,24,2,27,12,2,23

												Have you ever played on a Commodore 64? Sitting there playing a game like Choplifter with a stick, staring into a tube television trying to safe all the poor people trapped in crossfire, while bombing tanks and shooting military plains.If you have ever played Choplifter like that, don't even think, just buy. To anyone who have not had the pleasure to game like that, I'm sorry! But don't hold back because of that. It's still a really fun game, and you find yourself starting over in agony, that one guy died because you didn't do it good enough.Why are you still reading? Go game this instead!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was never a huge fan of the arcade Choplifter or even Choplifter 2 on the Gameboy. I did take a liking to Choplifter 3 on the Super Nintendo because of the huge advancements in gameplay that it offered. My liking to Choplifter 3 wavered alot after discovering the game's crippling difficulty after reaching just the first boss in the first world. Still I like the game and plan to tough it out through the game someday. But someday is gonna have to wait even longer now because here comes CHOPLIFTER HD!Choplifter HD plays absolutely perfect. The visuals are very budget Direct X9 but a game does not need shiny visuals to achieve greatness. The developers added in much more than I would have ever thought of. One of the things that gets me everytime is the hilarious and not to mention timely pilot and co-pilot dialog while playing. The voice work is extremely well done. The controls perfectly compliment the stellar action in this game. I highly recommend a XBOX 360 controller or Logitech dual shock because they are set up perfectly to compitently control your helecopter and it's weapons. The new laser sight aiming system is very accurate and fun to use. Choplifter HD is a model game for any remake of a retro title. The star rating system for level of completion makes you want to go back and try again until you achieve a 5 star rating. You unlock better helecopters as you gain more stars. There is also a hard mode which is unlocked after you beat the game on normal. This game is cheap and seriously fun.			",72,5,11,4,1,0,0

												This game has a lot of charm and tongue-in-cheek goodness to its tone, not taking itself too seriously. That said, I just couldn't get used to the turning controls. You have to push Q or E to rotate the chopper one way or the other, and I it's a crapshoot as to whether I hit the right button or not each time. Also, in one mission, a horde of enemies comes running from the ""north,"" and you have to rescue to men on the bridge that horde is running south on...but you cannot turn ""north"" in this game, so the two guys get killed every time I see them.New helicopters are locked behind getting more stars. Of course, to get more stars, you have to do better on missions. What's really annoying in the point system for me, which is what is used to calculate how many stars you're awarded, is that each killed civilian costs me 1,000 points. It doesn't matter if I kill the civilian or if someone else does. So on one mission, I saw two optional civilians. I could have just left them and they would have died, and it wouldn't have cost me anything. Instead, I risked my fuel, armor, and time to save the two men, and some random machine gun fire hit the chopper, killing one of those two fellows. So if those two men get killed by random bullets coming at you, then you just lost 2,000 points in additiona to the points you lost for the time you could have turned in for finishing early. This is counterintuitive. The risk of losing time is the gamble, and that's fine, but costing me extra points if they die? Really? =/I do enjoy the humor of the game, though the scoring system is a bit too harsh for me to be able to make much headway, and turning the helicopter ""south"" is almost always a disaster for me. I really don't like the enemies being in the foreground, requiring the pressing of additional buttons to turn to shoot them. If you can get the game for $5 or less and don't care if you'll ever finish the game or not, and don't mind the potential to have trouble with the turning controls, you might enjoy this game. Anyone not terribly skilled should probably avoid the game, though.			",428,108,2,62,33,5,50

												Choplifter is a sidescrolling arcade game, in which you pilot a rescue helicopter which must save civillians in warzones while fending off enemy troops. Choplifter was an old favorite of mine when I grew up; I played it often on the Commodore. When I saw the remake, I just had to get it.The game both succeeds and fails in a number of ways. It does a good job of replicating the gameplay of the original, and while they've added some more features, including multiple weapons, a speed boost, limited fuel and different chopper types, it's similar enough that the game feels very nostalgic.There's also more enemy types, including AA guns and RPGs, and the various stages show off mediocre, but visually pleasing environments from cities to deserts and jungles. Furthermore, there's some mildly humorous comments from your co-pilot and the various people you pick up during the game.Unfortunately, you have to deal with aiming controls which often don't work properly (you can aim in an arc around your chopper, and if often doesn't recognize your mouse unless you're in a sweet spot), and AI which often spoils your fun. It's not uncommon to fly in to rescue a civilian who then promptly runs in under your chopper and kills himself, or takes forever to figure out how to board the helicopter. These issues aren't severe enough that you'll hate the game, but you will be annoyed by it occasionally.CONCLUSION:If you're a fan of the original, it's worth taking a look. Even if this is your first encounter with it, it has the appeal of an addicting flash game - kind of entertaining, but very difficult to put down once you start playing. It probably doesn't have too much lasting appeal and it's still kind of broken, but if you wanna kill time, it does the job. ",97,14,10,9,13,0,10

												I remember playing a DOS-version of the original when I was a kid and I was addicted to it. This is a pretty good remake despite a few annoyances. While the graphical uplift is nice (there is some pretty cool action going on in the background), the voice acting in this game is awful. That also includes the writing as well. This comes as a HUGE dissappointment considering this is from the same company that made The Bard's Tale. The attempt at humor fails almost completely and also introduces an annoying reporter, ""Scoop Sanderson"" (LOL SEE WAT THEY DID THUR?). Thankfully you can mute ALL the voices completely.That being said, the gameplay is still a lot of fun, challenging and addicting, like the 30-year old original. Despite the lack of different choppers and gameplay modes and excruciating voice acting and lame humor , the game is a good buy at any discounted price.Also, Duke Nukem has a cameo in this game. And zombies too.7/10 ",512,61,18,38,16,5,24

												The original Choplifter was a revolutionary Apple II/e game that featured a pixel helicopter navigating a post-apocalyptic world covered in Sno Balls, rescuing the survivors from diabetes or something. The remake is mechanically sound and challenging, but it settles into a rut after an hour or so. But there's Duke Nukem in this game!!! If you find him maybe he'll say something that is vaguely interpreted as badass! Like, ""I ♥♥♥♥ed your mother with this helicopter"" or ""Can you loan me twenty bucks for the sex machine????""
