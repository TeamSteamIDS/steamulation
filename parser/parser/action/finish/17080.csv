												A flame that burns twice as bright, burns half as long. Tribes Ascend unofficially died within a year of its release, in large thanks to a very toxic community, but also thanks to a very dodgy developer. Some would say it was doomed from the start with the unrewarding unlock system, and its very liberal use of micro-transactions, but what really killed the game was the ""we didn't break through to a big enough market in the first year, so let's make something else"" attitude from the studio. Tribes Ascend was pushed aside, all future support and updates were suspended, with only the barest of support of some multiplayer-servers remaining to squeeze out any additional funds; And instead Hi-Rez focused all of their resources on the continued development and support of Smite - a MOBA game.Personally, Tribes Ascend was the best shooter experience I'd ever had; It was fun, it was exciting, and it was difficult - But pulling off a flag grab and then securing a capture was among the most rewarding things I'd ever done in a competitive video game. I played quite a few hours of Tribes Ascend, starting in late 2011 to somewhere in the middle of 2013 (though most of it done outside of Steam because of client issues), and I shelled out quite a few bucks too - not because I had to, but because I wanted the developers to know this was a game worth the money.But that didn't matter, and in the end Tribes Ascend simply went too fast for the devs. [VGTW]Update: Hi-Rez has revived Tribes Ascend, and are planning on making big, big changes to the game, most of them set to change the way the game is played. Whether this turns out to be a success, or another failed project on Hi-Rez part remains to be seen. But knowing that the community on r/tribes has been given a very large voice in all of this, I remain skeptical.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												2012: the year many tribes fans were dissapointed by the thought that Hi Rez didn't have the money to support this game further, and more so by the thought that SMITE was the real money maker. some folks thought that they were abandoning the game to milk the MOBA genre for money...in some ways, they were right. in others... well, that's the story of today.yesterday, the game had the aptly named ""Out of the blue"" update, which was being made behind the scenes with help from the Tribes community being the testers for... and oh man is it a doozy. everything is fine tuned, or changed up, aside from the maps, which only have the addition of 3 more to the roster, but they're still the same aside from the tweaks that affect the game with the update.the main thing you need to know is this: the old classes got kicked out. instead, it's simplified to 3 armor types that can pick and choose weapons and gear from thier weight class... if this sounds familiar, that's cause you're a Tribes vet. each of the 3 armor classes have thier upsides and downsides such as the tradeoffs of survivability vs speed, as well as what weapons and gear each class can use (heavies can't bring snipers, and lightweights can't bring heavy weapons or use spinfusor discs or discos/fractal nades). in addition, you can bring 3 weapons, but with another hitch: you are limited to bringing one of each weapon class. (heavies can bring 4 weapons total instead of 3, btw).TL;DR, this is the best chance to possibly get back into tribes, and give it another go... and before you think of it being P2W... the weapon upgrades are gone. when you unlock a new thing, what you see is what you get.PS: any exp and gold spent has been refunded, and if you have gold, you will have access to the entire armory.

												Great potential let down by a silly business model and lack of modding and map making support. The devs do not understand how tribes is played and delivered an unbalanced mess which, being tribes, is still fun to play but has no long-term legs. If mods had been a possibilty this could have been one of the best in the series, instead it is relegated to the f2p graveyard. Expect poor server performance if you decide to try this game out and inevitable server shut-down within a couple of years. Shame.Would have recommended this game 2 years ago but by now the Devs have dropped the game and killed the series unfortunately.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tribes, the definition of what I want to see in a game. The unique mechanics in this game are so original and flawless that it makes me weep for everyone who think each new call of duty is revolutionizing the FPS genre, or nearly any shooter for that matter. With tribes you need true skill to do almost anything in this beautiful game unlike some other shooters I know where spray and pray is just the norm. While that could mean a bit of a steep learning curve I guarantee you that your time will not be wasted learning this game, and you will surely understand from this from the brilliant ""cha-ching"" of your very first blueplate. This game is also very pretty if you can run it on the higher settings (unlike me) and the sense of speed as you fly through the terrain is unreal. Sadly though as I wright this review the developer, Hi-Rez, have completely dropped this game from their radar. It is no longer being looked after and the community is very small which is a shame with how magnificent this game is. Even though there is no campaign, no developer oversight, and hardly any people playing it this still remains to this day my #1 favorite game simply because of how perfect the core gameplay experience is and how unique this game is among the vast array of shooter that, to be honest, all feel exactly the same. Hopefully in the future there will be another addition to the tribes series and I sincerely hope that Hi-Rez will do it great justice and now that the company is out of its infancy will understand how to keep a game thriving. This game deserves so much more credit then it recieves, even if it recieved some form of GOTY award, it deserves even more attention. It saddens me that good games like this get shoved to the side and forgotten while every ""new"" COD gets so much attention even when it is doing the same thing over and over.What makes me most sad though is to anyone who would pick up this game today would not understand the impact this game had to some people in its prime, all they would see is hundreds of empty servers with what seems like 50 people online at any one time. Even though this game has admittedly gone downhill it will still remain as my favorite game of all time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Feels like a brand new game with this new update. Really fun and enjoyable experience now that there are only 3 classes instead of 9. I would say everything that was once wrong with this game is now fixed. Probably one of the best skill based shooters out right now. Totally worth a try if you enjoy a very fast paced game.

												Maybe you've heard the tales, of how Hi-Rez has abondoned their golden child. Whilst yes this is true, fear not! The gaming community has more than enough leverage to bring them back to this game and these are the reasons why. Don't worry there's a TL;DR at the bottomTribes Ascend is as unique as it gets when it comes to FPS. In Tribes the maps are so huge and its ski feature allows you to go so fast and at times you can sometimes feel adrenaline pumping through your veins. Add in the weapons which are mostly splash related and the only way to survive is to be moving. Stand still and you will die- not only does this make it the fastest pace shooter, it also means there will be no campers (except snipers, duh). The tactics, strategies and innovative ideas that spring up as to how to defeat the other side gives the game a lot of depth and lot of shazbots. To list all the features, I'd be writing a PhD, so to make my life easier, there's this: http://www.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/homeJust because the game appears dead doesn't mean it's not good already. Sure things will seem a little empty but if enough people read this and enough people get into it, I guarantee we can change things.All the classes blend together to create a synergy close to perfection and they individually cover so vast an angle that every class is needed and you will always see every class at work in a game. You won't see an entire team of Juggernauts because they'd be easily beaten by a nimble Pathfinder. Every class has it's pros and it's cons, and when put in a team form one mechanised unit that will steamroll the enemy. But you can also be flexible in that you won't have to stick to one class the entire time, you can switch it up. Sneaking in isn't working? Why not go in spinfusor toting and blow everything up? You don't have to invest too much into any one class and personally I find some of the starting weapons are amazing once you warm up to them. Spend hours trying them out. And if you like it, tell your friends to sign up, get the world united to bring this back, eh?And of course, there's the one quintessential aspect of the game I haven't explored a lot. The fact that it's free! This is a lifesaver for anyone-stingy or not and oh boy am I glad it's free. For such an amazing game, so unique and so complex I was dumbfounded at first when I found out it was free. There are those who say it's pay to win but don't take any of that nonsense. NONE of the weapons are ""better"" than the starting ones, they're all different and suit different people or different scenarios. For the one class you may prefer blowing people to kingdom come with the satisfaction of seeing the killing blow, having your enemies blasted out of existence with you a mile away or gunning them down while chasing them and see them try to escape. With the multitude of weapons and items available, Tribes offers you the chance to try them ALL out in the practice mode so you can set your sight on a new weapon and grind and shoot your way to the top with a goal in mind. And when you've gotten every weapon you possibly want, or every item there is available, you don't stop or run out of steam *badumtsi* because you're always trying to be the best and the adrenaline rush, the satisfaction of a Blue Plate, a headshot, a melee or anything is reward enough.TL;DR Not a moment in the game will you be bored and hours will fly by so quickly. So if you've played this before, but have felt defeated by Hi-Rez, get back on your feet or if you're completely new, go headfirst in and have a little faith. Login and start. Get your friends to jump in too. The more people we get, the more of the gaming community there are, the great ther chance of getting Hi-Rez's attention and bring this thing back. So spread the word, bring people into it, tell the gaming community and the world- even tell that random stranger on the road to. This game didn't deserve to end so quickly, so let's give it another shot. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 29
												There was a point where I'd recommend this game. It honestly pains me to see what has happened to it.I'd like to say I actually stopped playing Tribes for a long while. I heard they were updating it again, ignored it. Tried playing it again this January. I have a few words as a tl;dr I'll post here in the beginning and elaborate further down.tl;dr: ""What the ♥♥♥♥ was Hi-Rez thinking? This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing dying corpse of what it was!""Now let me elaborate. I'll start with some immediate key changes to the game that I personally do not understand why they changed.The ClassesGod just... what the ♥♥♥♥ were they even doing. This isn't neccessarily a 100% bad change but it's not good either.Before this game was changed a lot, you had three basic classes, each had three sub-classes of it. You have the light, medium, and heavy. For light you had the Pathfinder, the Sentinel, and the Infiltrator. Medium you had the Soldier, Raider, and Technician. Heavy the Juggernaut, Doombringer, and Brute. Each of these had their own specific set of weapons with a degree of loadout customization. To add to that there was this perk system which while it had it's own issues, is definitely better than what we have now.After the update, it was stripped down to ""Light"", ""Medium"", and ""Heavy"", all with their own loadout slots. The classes of before are all a legend of the past at this point. You could choose ""Light"", and give it any weapon & ability combo you want, which is one of the major downfalls of this game now. It removed the barrier between classes, or at the least severely lowered the gap. For reference, a Pathfinder trying to fight any of the heavy classes. It was possible to win this situation as the Pathfinder, but it would require concentration and the ability to out-maneuver the enemy. To any of the players playing post-update, they shall know that pitting a light against a heavy is a lot more ""even balanced"", in that the light class, if set up right, can easily dispatch a heavy when played correctly.This is one of the things that really set this game's base floor, was that the classes used to actually be different in ways more than just movement speed & health/energy. You could argue that weapons are still class-restricted in that only the heavies can get heavy variants of the weapon, sure. However that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things when a light class player could just give themselves a bunch of explosives, or design a class loadout specifically for taking out heavies.Bases. You know where this is going.What the ♥♥♥♥ was the decision making in this part? Seriously?Base upgrading has been outright removed from the game entirely. Turrets, Generators, Sensors. Nothing can be upgraded anymore. In fact the credit system was removed entirely. This pretty much makes playing technician exceptionally stale & boring. I have no inspiration to sit around my generator room for the entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ match with an enhanced repair gun just to repair a generator stuck at level 1 for eternity every 30 seconds it gets taken down by a rush, because our turrets are level 1 and even the worlds fattest heavy class can just ski right past them. I really don't have much more to say about this. It's a bad feature removal and should be brought back.Removal of the credits systemAs mentioned above, the credit system has been removed. From what I've tried, the call-in system just doesn't work anymore, even though you can still equip the call-in markers, which no longer have a display or show how much they used to cost. Of course this doubles in with the removal of base upgrading.Weapon (de)balancingBullet guns have been turned into pepper spray. The shotguns may as well be literally shooting pepper spray canisters. Other weapons have actually received buffs and assorted miscellaneous changes, with other special variants also being introduced. Most of the new variants I personally think might have an interesting change on the gameplay, if only the gameplay of Tribes: Ascend was still the way it was. So unfortunately, they don't really do too much.Weapons have had inane changes to their stats that feel out of place, and alienate me from wanting to continue playing this game. Just the same as the developers did eliminate some of the weapons from the game that no longer exist.Closing notesI cannot recommend anyone this game in it's current state. It feels like they picked up a game they abandoned at one point, said they'd update it some more, and then just tweaked a whole bunch of stuff to see how the community would react and then never change it back.Also another huge negative from what I'm seeing in some other reviews and discussions, apparently people can no longer register to play Tribes: Ascend. So if you already have an account on this game, lucky you. You get to play it. Were you reading reviews to consider playing this game? Well sorry but you're out of luck. Even if you install the game, you apparently can't make an account from what I've read. If anyone can prove those dozens of claims wrong, by all means go ahead.On a final closing note, I genuinely hope Hi-Rez realizes this game is dying, with population numbers declining still. With hope they'll revert the game to the way we all enjoyed playing it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My favorite part is where no one plays this. EDIT 2: Apparently people can mark reviews as funny now.      Shazbot!EDIT 3 : ( Rephrased some words below, because for some reason people actually read it. )EDIT 1 ( MAIN PART OF THE REVIEW BELOW ): Since people actually somehow managed to find this review, I decided to put at least a little bit of an actual review in here. Not a detailed one because I haven't played the game for a long time, but my personal information about the game.(SIDENOTE: If you want a review that follows a linear flow of explaining information, this isn't the one. I mainly jump around from topic to topic, mostly because this came from the top of my head.)     ( Sorry random OCD guy.)Tribes:Ascend is a great game, but sadly, a lot of players are missing from the game because developers have moved onto SMITE and they abandoned this game a while ago.They have made some changes to the game though, that has varied since the release of Tribes:Ascend. One thing they did was cut back on the amount of grinding required, which was really nice for F2P players. The game certainly isn't pay-to-win, but it is deterring to see that a playstyle you want isn't available for you. Most of the default stuff are mostly usable, but I do have to point out that the other weapons are just more fun to use. ( And sometimes more effective. )The gameplay features high-speed combat, which will be very rewarding to those who value skill.Coordinated roles and classes give the game a nice feel for it's objective based gameplay, and offers multiple different playstyles. Supportive roles, defensive roles, and offensive roles are ALL viable, and they all help you win the game. There's also a in-game voice communication system that slightly helps with immersion ( if you're into that sort of thing. )There's also a few game modes ( many of which are probably dead. ).My personal favorite is Capture the Flag, because it requires a variety of roles by the team.Maybe you want to be the guy who grabs the flag at high speed.Maybe you want to be the guy who sits on the flag and laughs at the guy who just died because he rammed into you at high speed.Or maybe, you want to be like a sneaky ninja and blow stuff up. ( People included. )The amount of skill required in this game is more than any normal FPS. You can't just aim down the sights of your gun and kill a guy in 1 second. You need to actually try to kill him, because 95% of the weapon in this game are not hitscan, which means you WILL have to shoot ahead of a moving target and if you want your projectile to even land CLOSE to him.Experienced players will 'blue plate' someone. ( Blue plate is when you hit a poor guy directly with a spinfusor. )Newer players may find it easier to use rapid-firing weapons until they're ready to try out the Spinfusor.New players will also learn the term 'Shazbot!' ( Which will not be explained here. )There is progression in this game, but they unlock different playstyles and weapons, rather than directly upgrading your weapons. ( Not counting some of the other things you can upgrade, but let's forget about those for now. )You don't unlock a grip for your gun to reduce 15% penalty to accuracy, you don't get a scope and whatever, you'll actually want to unlock other classes and weapons. One of the classes has access to a fractal grenade ( the disco grenade ) and another class has invisibility. I'm not going to list every single class, but you get the point. Weapons play a large part of Tribes as well as the classes. While a technician can put down a turret, some guy on a hill can make it rain explosives on him and clear the objective for a friendly to move in.Sadly, you won't be able to unlock TotalBiscuit's voice unless you pay real money.Yes. His voice is in the game. You can also buy skins and stuff so you look different. Not like you'd show it off to anyone anyways.You can also get credits or whatever to buy resupply points and call in orbital strikes.Credits are only for the duration of the match, so feel free to call in the thunder.As for performance, I've always had a problem on low-end PCs, so this isn't really the game you want to be playing on a low budget, but you shouldn't really have any performance problems if you have a medium to high end rig. There's a few performance.ini's on the internet somewhere if you really wanna play this on a potato. Trust me, I tried, and I at least went fast enough to kill something.If you've read the original portion of the review, I joke about how no one plays this ( because no one does ) but that doesn't mean I don't want anyone to play it. If you have slogged through this thing that steam calls a review, give Tribes a try. If you like it, tell your friends. Maybe it'll actually have some people playing it. ( Yeah right. )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game with absolutely wonderful potential, a slightly less wonderful fanbase, and an absolutely horrendous dev team. Instead of balancing things, coming out with skins and new weapons was Hi-Rez's concern. And then, after saying they'll ""Look into"" custom maps, dev tools for the community, and other things, what do they end up doing? Dropping the game, for the 3rd person moba ""Smite"", which is beginning to suffer the same problems that Tribes: Ascend suffered in it's lifespan. I can only hope that they don't muck up Tribes: Ascend 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been replaying this recently and loving it (I use the non-steam client) so I thought I'd repost this recommendation now that the character limit has gone. ======So far the best iteration of Tribes since Tribes 2. What's more its free to play so you've got no excuse not to give it a try.SkiingFor those who don't know the series Tribes offers team based gameplay with one of the best movement mechanics in arena style FPS called skiing.It combines physics, jetpacks, the environment and the skill of the player to have you rocketing around the map at the speed of sound and makes for some excellent chases in capture the flag type scenarios and great combat that has you estimating trajectories of projectiles and players to produce some of the most epic trickshots you'll see in any game.ClassesIt also has a really nice class system that has subtle class differences which are exaggerated by player role choices in game. The subtlety results in a much more natural role selection basic much more on strategy rather than the ""I'm playing the heavy-defender class therefore I only defend""Map DesignOne thing that also stands out to me is that I think the map design is beautiful for an arena game. While they do share some common features on the whole each map feels unique and have loads of great little details to bring them to life.FTPFinally for those who are nervous about free to plays being pay to win (as I was until recently) Tribes: Ascend feels like its got the right balance of paying giving you enough perks to make it worth it (which is important if you want the game to stay alive) but without being an essential element to play and kick♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rather than money opening up bigger scarier guns, it seems to open up alternative roles to play within the game, all of which are available over time when playing the game for free.DownsidesThe only thing missing from this wonderful iteration of the classic franchise is the modding that came with Tribes and Tribes 2. I remember my brother and I having a whale of a time as kids playing with a lot of mods and user generated maps that added a whole ton of content to the game. While it's obvious why this can't work in a FTP game, it's a bit of a shame. Hopefully though, if HiRez studios are successful they'll be enough interest to keep them adding official content to the game to keep us all keen.How to try it?Give it a go! It's free. Sign up and download at https://account.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥=1899863&utm_campaign=email and for those new to the series, or who just need a bit of revision there is a great inforgraph here http://puu.sh/w7SC which gives you a bunch of handy pointers to get you going!!!! UPDATE !!!It's a bit of a shame but the game has been pretty much abandoned by the dev's and from what I've read the community is basically dead. It's still free and it's still good when you've got a game, but be careful before investing any money into the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Contrary to my experience, there seems to be a lot of people complaining about how this game is ""dead"", that there are no players anymore and that you will be somehow unable to install it using Steam.Pros-I have had no problems whatsoever be they technical or player-wise. The game even runs smoothly on my sub-par PC.Game still looks good on absolute minimal settings.Addictive high-speed gameplay.Makes you feel like a badass speed demon.A variety of weapons and classes to unlock, suiting any play style.Projectile based weapons make every shot a gamble and you feel awesome when you land one.Challenges- Learning how judge where your projectiles will hit is extremely difficult.You have to be able to think fast.The enemy team is somehow always well-organized and skilled, while your own team is a just a bunch of scrubs.At first you will get frustrated, but keep playing and you'll get better.Overall, I love this game. It's unique and ridiculously fun. Give it a shot! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hi. I am a bit torn apart with this game. I'll recommend it but I don't like it. Let me explain.I used to play Tribes Ascend ALOT a few years ago. Then I let it go and went to play other timesinks and forgot my characters name, password and even the email I used to log on to my account with. So now that I heard that there was a new patch and people got interested into the game again, I gave it a chance again and made a new account. At start I felt like a dirty dirty man as it almost felt like sealclubbing to own scrubs under level 8, but I knew it wouldn't last forever and when I would get to level8+ matches, I would get my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me. Thats just how this game goes. At first I felt that the game was fun again (even thou there wasn't all too many players around), fast, furious and exciting. Hirez had reworked the game thoroughly and removed many aspects of the game and at first I had nothing bad to say about it. Untill it striked me in one game. Really hard. Back in the day when I played Tribes Ascend alot, I was the guy in defence. Keeping generator, turrets and radar alive. Giving inventory stations power and fending off enemies from flag. Using my credits to upgrade all those base assets to help the team. Giving the rest of the players a better chance to go and attack and get that flag to our base without fear of loosing our own base to the enemy. I admit that it wasn't easy at times but I was kinda ok at it and I grinded that engineer up to level 28 (50 is max). -Classes are erased and in their place are just light, medium and heavy loadouts and that's just fine for me. It just makes loadouts more versatile.-Back in the days the generator room was harder to get into and the generator itself couldn't be bombarded from outside with mortars from miles away like in some new maps nowdays. That just makes defending the generator so much harder.-The upgrade and credit systems are gone. So the base assets (gen, radar, turrets) will stay underpowered through the whole game and they can be nuked in a matter of seconds by anyone, but repairing still takes ages. -The perk system is gone. I liked perks. They made the game more versatile and gave player a way to choose his/her own playstyle. I liked to carry more mines and be super heavy or draw my weapon more quickly. I don't care if some or most of them are nowadays placed in the appropriate classes. It takes the diversity away from gameplay as everyone playing a loadout are exactly the same(except gun choices ofc.)-Vehicle heath reduced greatly.It just seems like the game is nowadays more about it's speed and only it's speed. Go for the flag/kill and everything else is useless and stupid. The game used to have loads of micro things to do and the game awarded players for filling different roles and now as the credits are gone you only get experience out of the combat. Now there seems to be only the attackers and flag cappers. Defense is useless. Many guns&gear are nowadays useless and even vehicles are pointless to get as they are so weak. In a really fast paced game a slow moving tank doesn't sound like really useful thing in the first place but it used to be a great way harass enemys defence so that the flag capper had easier time to do HIS job. And as the credits are gone and base defending is made nearly impossible, then why bother use the hard earned exp to unlock defensive guns or gear? And why bother unlock other guns to attack as there is a great variety to start with and it is a long way to master any of them anyway. Only thing that is somehow worth of  your money and time might be skins. Even exp boosters feel pointless now as it feels like there is so much less to do in Tribes Ascend(unless you get some satisfaction from gaining levels). But still. I think the game is very good and enjoyable for many people. It's still a great FPS. But not that great team fps so it's not for me. ps. sorry for bad grammar and misspelling, English ain't my first language.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I used to play this game a lot.It even was, in fact, my favourite multiplayer.Which has sadly changed since the last update on the 8th of December 2015.It is undeniably a very unique game & most likely the fastest paced FPS in the world.What makes this game so gorgeous is not only its creativity with the gameplay, mechanics and weapons, but also a certain simplicity: There is a concept, but no campaign, no special missions. Just the good old gameplay you find in every server.FPS are naturally repeatitive, that's not a secret, but what is crucial is its capability to keep combats versatile and allow players to shape the battle for it to never become boring and this game managed to do this oh so well.What I truly love about this game is: 1) The quick progress.You are paid very well for your success and the awards you receive for certain actions are limitless.Just by playing for, let's say... 7-9 hours, throughout 3 days, for instance, you have already made some big progress.Some weapons might be very expensive, but everything is affordable. This is nowhere near being a Pay2Win game.And the levelling was also quite quick.You get to max out your armour, your weapons and gadgets after a few days of playing.But it always depends, it depends on how well you actually do... Good weapons don't automatically put you head-on with the pros & here's my second point:2) The importance of one's skills.No matter how many guns you have & how badass youn look in your fancy skins, you don't get to kill someone who's passing by at 350km/h with a spinfusor if you don't even know what you're doing.It really takes training to be good at this game & every weapon is unique and most of them, if not all, are really good in their own ways. But, of course, it also depends on the user whether it is any good.Maybe you like it firey, maybe precise, maybe heavy with a lot of lasers and light effects.And this has also something to do with:3) The weapons simply being unique.If you have played Warframe before, or any MMO RPG, you will obviously encounter weapons that are clearly & simply in every aspect objectively stronger than other ""low tier"" weapons. For instance, starting of with an apprentice staff in WOW, you won't ever be able to kill the Lich King with that thing. Or starting off with the Skana in Warframe, you will, at some point, receive the broken war & notice that every stat is just green and much higher when you compare it with the Skana.Not in mother♥♥♥♥ing Tribes, because these weapons have their own strengths. It's not like in Warframe, where you just have a stronger weapon to kill stronger enemies the exact same ♥♥♥♥ing way as ever; ""Click-click-Dead"" (And their powers are just fancier ways to get done with the enemies, let's be honest) In this game, you are everything that matters!Hell, you can even kill an experienced gamer with a n00b gun, if you know how to do it.Sure, some weapons deal more damage than others, but that doesn't make them objectively stronger!Some are explosives, other are rifles, some are disc shooters, some have splash damage, higher fire rates, and overall completely different projectiles and/or ways to deal damage!This is not about the guns, the armour, the vehicles, this is about you, the player, and how well you do with what you have to choose from!It took a lot to ruin this game for me and here's what it was:The update introduced some really interesting new mechanics to the game. The greatest being the completely free customisation, others being rebalanced weapons, new weapons and also, a bunch of new maps were introduced.The customisation is really exciting, actually.One gets to choose from the three armour classes and the rest is completely up to them, with some restrictions, obviously, and specification on the armour types.Look, I don't think it's good or bad. It is some progress, yes, but personally, I preferred the old system.It just felt right to me, it gave some feeling, meaning and life tothe classes, I'd say, and a role to the player using them.Those roles were renderred completely redundant after the update, though, because everyone was unique, which is obviously not bad, of course. It is something I love about the game Angels Fall First, for instance, where the customisation is just like that, but to me, it just doesn't fit in the game.Like I said, this is completely subjective.What is definitelly not subjective, but just straight up bad, useless, yeah even gamebreaking, is the removal of the Perks, some weapons and the levelling/upgrading system.Lordy, do I even need to comment on that?Starting off with the guns:I understand why some guns were balanced, some clearly needed to be.The Nova Colt, especially, I guess we all can agree.I hope, however, that none were nerfed that did not deserved to be nerfed.I haven't come across one, so far.I really love that they added new ones, but maybe the blinkfusors being available for all classes makes the game a bit unbalanced. Not too sure though.But actually removing some?I really don't see why they should.The ones that were removed seemed totally fine, at least to me.Ah yes, I remember, several class-specific guns were removed, for instance one the Raider used.Why would they remove that? The reduced freedom to choose only generalises the custom builds more.But the ones that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most being removed were the MKII versions of the start weapons.As you may know, every class receives a certain preset of weapons to use, until one earns enough to buy better equipment and every onne of those start weapons has a stronger version of them.Basically the exact same (mostly), but just stronger in several ways, mostly damage.Well, those were removed and that's complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to me.Because not only is that one thing bad enough, but also the fact that the levelling/upgrading system was removed!Renderring every weapon weak and sometimes useless.You know, you were able to upgrade your weapons by simply using them in combat and gaining experience with them, which made them stronger, but you were also able to pay to max it out.Welp, that is gone now and you might think... the most logical thing to do would be to leave them in the state they would be when they're maxed, right? Well, NOPE, cuz mother♥♥♥♥ing High-Rez nerfed'em all.You receive a weapon in the level 1 state and it stays like that forever.Look, they level up quickly and after a few days, ♥♥♥♥ing everyone on the battlefield is using maxed out weapons.It is fair for everyone involved and the ones using low-tier weapons aren't put into that much of a disadvantage though.Even if, they could still choose to join a noob server.Nobody would complain!So in the end, the weapons are only low-tier for like 5% of their time used and will stay maxed out for the rest of your life!Probably 90% of the guns used in a battle are already maxed out and nobody is really in a disadvantage.And nobody is used to using these low-tier weapons with lower damage, smaller clips, less magazines, shorter range and sooo much more, it's ridiculous...But the most ridiculous thing is that this also affects armour, packs and perks.The armours will stay that weak, the packs will stay as inefficient and so on...But actually removing the perks just made everything go to♥♥♥♥♥♥It used to offer SO much versatility and many special passive or active abilities to enhance one's usefulness in combat!Now nobody has any special abilities anymore, everyone is weaker, no more additional energy or less mass...But do you know how ridiculous it is to run around with just one ♥♥♥♥ing mine and having to constantly resupply because of the lack of upgrades and perks?That, people, is the most ridiculous part of it all, if you ask me.High-Rez, you broke the game.Thank you very much.

												I used to play this game a lot from 2013 to the end of 2015 and loved it, but I stopped, you might ask ""why did you stop?"". Well to put it in simple terms, this game was comepletely ruined when it got updated in 2015.It was a great game back then and it had a lot of potential, but unfortunately HiRez abandoned it, which seemed like a stupid decision to the thousands on thousands of players, but it made sense too since they were losing money. What really destroyed this game was its attempt to reboot it with a supposedly ""good"" update. But it was a complete flop, the update removed lots of our favourite weapons and merged all the original classes into just 3. Ever since that the game has gone downhill, I, as well as a lot of people I knew, left the game. All of this happened purely because HiRez didn't listen to player feedback, especially from the top and long-time players (I was Devilshouse - you may remember me).But one thing that can never fail to entertain in this game is the voice chat.

												Before launch, this game had me really excited, even became a ""VIP"" contributor (before this game hit steam +150 hours). It was tribes, but it didnt feel like tribes that much. The vast amount of automatic weapons was just mindblowing, in a bad way. It was like the devs was trying to make CoD on jetpacks. Some complained and some gave good feedback about various aspects of the game, but the devs just didn't listen. Even though the feedback was given by veteran tribes players! And now it seems like the game has been left to rot.It feels like a good genre has been touched by something foul and tainted.You might enjoy it, if you haven't played any other tribes games. If you have played tribes 2 or T:V, you might enjoy it for awhile, but in the end, it won't feel like tribes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love Tribes: Ascend. It's a fast-paced first person shooter with good/ok graphics. The ""skiing-and-jetpack"" system is amazing, the weapons are really cool but slightly unbalanced (in my opinion). But..There are issues installing/starting/playing it. The developers have abandoned it, there are only 3-5 servers with players (worldwide). Many players are ""veterans"" so it's hard for beginners to get into. Very few are actually nice and it happens quite often that you get heavily insulted for killing them. I had fun playing years ago and even the past 2 months but I decided that it's just not worth it. I am tired of insults, bots, obvious hacking/coding and the community in general.I recommend the game but it's almost dead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played over 1k h(wild guess,probably more) of this game just not on steam.I met so many interesting people,basicaly knew how every guy plays.BEWAREWhile playing this game you may get an adrenaline rush.This was a fast paced,team oriented capture the flag game.It looked and sounded amazing for a f2p.Yeah the game was a bit unbalaced but when you get better it really doesn't matter.If the team doesn't cooperate you lost no matter how good the players are individually .It had 9 classes so you get the point,as long as at least 5-8/16 players play their roles team can work.I won't even talk about the last ''patch''.Some people say this copied Halo but Tribes series is older than Halo.Some people say that this game is full of hackers, in over 1k h i met maybe 5 hackers(if even that many).Some people complained that the game is too unbalanced when in reality its just a lil bit harder to get into it than some more casual shooters.Oh yea btw the game is DEAD.Sadly the devs moved onto smite and abandoned one of the best (if not the best) f2p fps of alltime.Will forever remember this game and the people i played with even tho i'll probably never hear from them again...VGB my friends.

Now that I finally have a rig that can run it, the community died and the game has been changed.

												I actually played a lot of this game when it first came out, and it looked to be going well for a while. HiRez were chipping in pot bonuses for tournaments, promoting the game on streams and such, it could have been good.Frankly the game had and has too many flaws to write an all-encompassing review including all of its many faults, but among the highlights have to be HiRez' complete lack of common sense, vision for the final product, and inability to listen to feedback from top players, even on trivial matters (I recall a forum thread pleading for replay-support, where some HiRez employee came in to basically say ""we could do this, but we won't""), the redesigns and gross mismanagement of classes/loadouts, lack of decent balance for certain weapons, the GOTTA GO SLOW, the menu UI, the game's performance, the grind, the lies, the microtransactions, the...really, it's The Everything.Then, years after the game had been aborted, they (I think it was like 1 rogue developer with community feedback and a lack of Jesus in his life) release a patch that is half idiocy and half comp mod, and now even the casuals who stuck with this mess for years don't wanna play the game anymore.If you actually want a history lesson on why this game is dead, here you go. It's a fantastic tale of incompetence.Despite all of this. the game could be fun for new players as a f2p title, if it had players. It doesn't.[steamcharts.com] For good reason. Even the very few players it has are undeserved and probably nostalgic/poor people.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hi-Rez has to be one of the shadiest game devs out there.  They have abandoned T:A to work on their MOBA money-grab, SMITE, full-time.  T:A is left in a bug-filled, unbalanced state.The Starsiege:Tribes Franchise was known for its high-skill ceiling, complex Flag-running tactics, sheer speed (thanks to jetpacks, rocket-jumping, and the ""skiing"" mechanic) and high-level competitive play.  Throwing the flag to a teammate while you're both mid-air, flying at high-speed along different vectors... the games were white-knuckle, high speed action.Once custom servers get up and going, and you can enjoy it the way previous Tribes games were meant to be enjoyed, then it might be a worth-while investment of your time.But don't give any more money to Hi-Rez.  They're shady as #*$&.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It really pains my heart to have to review Tribes: Ascend like this.The core mechanics are quite solid and the skiing is undoubtedly the thing that drew me to this game the most. The maps are varied and distinct and make for some very fun team gameplay.But with Hi-Rez's discontinuation of support and the shortage of players, it's simply not worth trying out. You won't find enough people to play with to fill a team, and being on a server with one other person just isn't any fun.It's a shame because the skiing is definitely where Ascend becomes something of its own and not just another shooter, and it's sad to think that it will likely not appear outside of Ascend for some time.

												Hi-Rez installs their own root level service.  Remember the expensive class action Sony lost for installing rootkits?  Their shrink wrap EULA didn't save them.Hi-Rez advises people to turn off their UAC, anti-virus and firewall.  Is that advice bad enough to be held liable?  It's right there on their website.Hi-Rez installs Flash.  Did you see the latest list of Flash exploits?  Pretty much their entire history they've been enabling malware and exploits.Hi-Rez and anyone else who installs malware like programs and gives malware enabling advice should be suspended from Steam until they remove the offending code.  Repeat offenses should result in a ban.  That's what Apple and Google do to keep their market clean.For the record, I love Tribes 1 & 2.  Ascend used to be OK but had input lag even on a 4GHz machine.  Unfortunately, the new patch nerfs defense so bad it turns Ascend into a bum rush & spawn camping game like 99% of the other online games.  The armor configuration method is also incredibly bad, resembling a Towers of Hanoi puzzle to select the items you want in the slots you want with many classic combinations blocked entirely.  Many better configuration systems exist in other games going back to the 80s.  All they had to do was copy one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Updated Review, after 660+ hours put into this game:[VGTG-VGS]My all time favourite first person SHAZBOT. You know a FPS game is going to be damn right amazing when you have a speedometer.This is my go-to game when I am feeling down or I'm raging from other games. Some people have CS, TF2 or Quake. I have VGS. The freedom of motion is amazing, and everything you're doing is so damn fun because of the fun mechanics.Pros:- free to play; great model; prices have been halved a while ago; ♥♥♥♥ING TRY IT- high skill roof; one of the hardest games to master those plates- skiing - my damn favorite mechanic to have in a game. Frictionless skiing.- jetpacks - goes hand in hand with ^ - all classes are fun- objective-based play; death stats and K/D ratio aren't even in the game - capture that flag with your team or go home- [VGS] commandshttp://www.shazinator.com/VSDD+VSTD+VDB+VDE+VNS+VBR+VBE+VGS+VGTT+VSAB+VTW+VGS+VGS+VSAB+VVW+VTN+VGS+VGS+VGQ+VSAF+VAW+VFF+VAD+VGS+VGS+VGTB+VSAF+VAW+VFF+VAD+VED+VFF+VNC+VDB+VGTG+VGW+VGCG- competitive- GOTTAGOFAST

												As said in many other comments and reviews before my own, this game has lost it's touch. I used to play it everyday because of the incredible adrenaline rush I would get from dueling it out with spinfusors in the sky or skiing down slobes at 300km/h only to jump and ride the next slope.The update changed it in such a way that most of those feelings are dulled. Nothing feels as impressive as it used too and there's no reason to go back for more playtime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games I have ever played! Fast paced action and jetpacks will leave you missing almost every shot, making a frag a very rewarding experience. The biggest downside is the fact that they stopped supporting this game for a while, and spend very little time on it now, which caused a lack of excitement in the community, which is now very small. I reccomned it, to anyone that likes a challenging FPS game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game will always have a special place in my heart for what it offered me in 44 ranks and 767.4 hours. Sadly not a single value of those will ever go up for me.Some may really like the changes the devs made, and others, like me, despise it because of how much flavor they removed from the game. I don't think merging guns and classes (not to mention a lot of nerfing) was the right way to bring tribes back to life.If you're new you may like it, despite the even larger learning curve and salty community, if you're a returning vet, prepare for a slap to the face.

												Tribes Ascend gets the Game Of The Year reward and a bunch of other good stuff!Then Smite comes along...Hi-Rez decides to work on Smite than Tribes AscendWhy?$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$How dead did the game become?Well, there were no forums, no updates, no customer support... (when you did contact customer support they referred to the game as smite)The only thing you could do is download the game.Why not work on Tribes Ascend instead?Tribes Ascend got Game Of the Year.And what did Smite win? Money?Has HiRez done something like this before?Yes. An even older game (but made with the same engine) called Global Agenda is more abandonded than Tribes Ascend. That game is an MMORPG, like Smite (hint hint)Then, after constant demands from the remnants of the Tribes Ascend community (mostly GOTY edition owners, but also those who liked the game a lot and whose game didn't stop working), HiRez comes out with the ""out of the blue"" update!First off, let's make the original Tribes games free!Too bad no one liked them, but yay!Next, let's change the liked class system with a system from the older games: light, medium, and heavy.Noooo! why would you simplify the class system (which actually overcomplicated it. Now there are a bunch of restrictions, like you cant cloak with the sniper rifle.)We did this by popular demand.What popular demand? Those who migrated to Smite or something?Oh, and all that money you spent on the GOTY edition and all of that gold/silver you used to buy weapons? We refunded it all back.Great, real great... Now I need to find the weapons I bought before... And they removed GOTY edition? why?We also removed a bunch of boring weapons and kept the OP onesWhy? My loadouts consisted mostly of that!!!We also added something called the ""all weapons pack""Oh, I see now... A variant of the P2W GOTY edition pack without the loadout, class, and perk unlock (which were removed or changed to make GOTY edition not much more than all weapons)We also added 2 new maps from previous Tribes gamesYay, although the previous games weren't that good...Thank you for playing Tribes Ascend, hope you enjoy the new Tribes, have a nice day, blablabla outro stuffReally? Really?NOW!Tribes Ascend has reverted to the remnant player community it was after the shutdown. With only a few servers with actual players, Tribes Ascend has only gone down. Nice job, HiRez.

I stopped playing when I got into to tf2 and I came back and I didn't have the same experience. I hate the new update of the 3 classes instead of 9 and being able to bring 3 primary weapons with you?

												Best shooter ive ever played, skill cap is ridiculously high but the game is somewhat noob friendly, gameplay is so slick and elegant. Radio communication is beautiful. Graphics are beautiful and possibilities for MLG kills are endless. Did I mention that this game has ridiculous competitive value? Hell yeah it has. The problem? The company. This is the same company (Hi-Rez Studios) that made SMITE, and they totally dropped tribes. Servers are terrible, cant report cheaters, and even logging in, installing all that is a problem now. I heard that they are starting to work on tribes again tho, if they do, play this game. Till they do it, play something else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 BAD STUFF I really wanted to like it. I celebrated when the out of the blue update came out. but as like most greedy companies, high rez can't live with out monitizing the crap out of their game.  Where to begin, the community is toxic as hell. most people would complain ""wassn't tribes 2 and vengance the same way"" no where close as to how bad it is in this game. people slam and insult eachother other petty little things and complaints. even pointing out how stacked teams are will get you removed from a server, cause the vets have no respect for new players trying to get into the game.  speakign of stacking adn vets, the small community that remains with in the game is pretty much only one of two groups of vetern players. both of which regularly pile up on one team from what I'v watched. And pummel the other players on the other while insulting them, pretending their balls are bigger then the earth cause they are all on one team.  Weapon acqusition isnt too bad, but it plays in part with the whole ""Stacking"" deal. In old tribes games, you never had to unlock weapons. you joined a server, you set up your load outs and you go. no having to acquire 12000 points to buy your shocklance, no getting 8000 points to buy your mines to put down on the flag. its what kept the community freindly, I sucked to high heaven in tribes 2, but didn't matter to me. I had every thing in the game, there wassn't any thing I had to grind for? why get angery?  In tribes ascend how ever you haved to grind out XP to buy your weapons, packs, gernades, every thing except for vehicles. a patch after the out of the blue update made it easier to grind up the XP's tog et weapons but still with the need to win to get the best ammount of XP's leads to the enviroment between plays to be very toxic and not for those who were hoping to learn from teh vets. CAuse sadly it will most likely end with you getting frustrated and the vets just laughing and pointlessly seeking you out to kill you as well as slanderize you down to the personal level point of sayying things that are considerably in the zone of harresment.I want to see the game flourish, I really wanted to relive the glory days of tribes 2 and vengance but jsut high rez screwed it up to much, they should just stick with making MOBAS cause this tribes game is a stain on the tribes name. GOOD STUFF  BUT... not everything about this game is bad. the mechanics for stuff liek skiing, disk jumps and such are just gorgouse and fluid. and the graphics are actually not half bad for a tribes game... if only they werent wasted.  they did bring back old favorites fromt eh series, such as the original desighn of the spin fusor (But its called the ""light spin fursor"" and as the name suggest, its only for light armor), as wella s shocklance, plasma gun and relativly similar model desighn for the gernade launcher from Tribes 2. to add further to that they kept up the looks of blood eagle and diamond sword armor (if you don't know what I mean. go google what a diamond sword heavy looked like in tribes 2, then look at a diamond sword heavy in ascend)  for even more nestolgia they brought back a few maps from old games! Though when playing them youl be quick to notice... they shrunk a fair bit... (when did katabatic get so small?)   Do I recommend you play tribes ascend?    Despite they nestolgia they put back into teh game. no ...I can't bare to let the vets in that game but jerks to more people looking to relive their old days. you can play it if you really wanna try but be warned, the community is more toxic then chocolate would be to a dog. You wont hear me complain about the learning curve, all tribes games are like that. Thats what made them fun! but the whole having to unlock your gear thing is what disgraces the tribes name. made the players more hostile to people trying to get on their level. rather then just joking about and explaining how to they crazy stunts they do.

												This was my favorite game for the longest time. My PC never ran it very well, even on low settings. But I loved it. It's so depressing what happened to it. HiRez essentially disowned it and left it for dead. After that, the community plummeted and now there aren't many people playing it at all. ;(It was a very unique game when it was thriving. I had a lot of fun learing the classes, and perfecting my play style. I would love to see them make yet another Tribes game rather than trying to revive this one. They patched it(out of the blue), and obviously didn't find the community worth continuing with updates.In closing, I would've recommended this game when if was first released(as well as the first 2 years of it's lifetime). 100%However, after the amount of active players started to decline, it wasn't worth playing any longer. So I cannot recommend this game in it's current state.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT: My hours played does not match actual time played. This game was released on it's own launcher for quite some time before steam. Also note that this game officially has support of a dev team again and many changes are taking place.  I haven't had time to go back and try it again, but when I do, I will change this review.This game gives shame to the name Tribes if you have ever played the original version. Tribes: Ascend focuses on quick play snatch and capture mechanics with very limited ability to defend the flag other than chasing down the enemy constantly, which is very difficult due to the 10 second captures skilled players can do.In the original ""Starsiege: Tribes"", any player could set all the defenses with each team having a resource cap on the amount of defences that could be set. In Ascend, each class has their own defence abiliy and only 1 per player. So ASSUMING your team even sets down their defense ability, you have a very very small defense to block the enemy.Another problem I have is Starseige used to actually make getting the flag difficult by putting them IN buildings with many turns and hallways so a player could not simply fly past it and grab it like in Ascend.This game falls so short of actually being competitive it's just sad.

Условно бесплатная игра, которая на самом деле не заставляет тратить ни копейки, отлично выглядит и заставляет (если вы еще не пробовали Tribes) по-новому взглянуть на онлайн-шутеры. Да и со многими полноформатными собратьями она способна конкурировать на равных. Как говорится, чего еще можно желать? Разве только чтобы в магазине появился, наконец, новый скин для Джаггернаута.

												This was, at one point, an excellent game, one I poured a fair sum of money into, but unfortunately the developers have all but abandoned the game with many issues still left untouched, the once regular content updates that kept the game fresh are gone, and few people seem to care about it any more.

But thankfully they didnt give up on the Tribes series because Tribes Universe is in development as of right now. Hopefully they don't cancel it like past games they were making.

												Having played this a long time after the early 2012 hype, I can say that I see why people enjoyed this game - and why they left it. Of all the F2P games out there, the system in place here feels the most abrasive. So we essentially have a fast paced and highly competitive shooter (at least, on paper) with a unique concept, but we need to ""unlock"" classes and weapons? I haven't played any of the other Tribes games, but even so I felt like I was playing a game that is a mere shell of its potential - and seeing how the developer outright abandoned it for a soulless MOBA cashgrab, I don't see it ever changing. The worst part about this game is that there are some genuinely fun and well designed parts when you get past the layers of cash shops and leveling systems, much like a puppy trapped in a sewer. It's heartbreaking, and its why I can't even recommend giving it a small trial.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Did you like Tribes? Did you like Tribes 2? Did you like Tribes: V- hahahahahah, no one likes Tribes: Vengeance. But you might like Tribes: Ascend. The fundamental mechanics(especially after the latest pair of patches) are very much Ye Olde Tribes. You pick an armor weight, you pick a weapons-and-gear loadout, you spawn, you use your jetpack, you ski, you eat a spinfusor to the face like thirty times before you remember that Tribes isn't like other FPS games.But then you get your first Air Mail or Blue Plate Special(mid-air kill), and suddenly you're having fun. Because suddenly you GET it. You get into five-minute duels with others, you grab the flag at 300kph(or stop a capper going at 300kph) and you GRIN, and suddenly it's 2am and you have to make an executive decision whether to go to work with five hours of sleep or play Tribes for another three hours and calling in sick.The only thing holding back Tribes: Ascend is really a few balance issues(Beowulf tanks are currently a bit pitiful and Shrikes could use a mild nerf) and some map design issues(on some maps, generators and base assets are very vestigial indeed), but you should still play the game, because on the good maps, you're really going to be having a LOT of fun once you get the hang of it.Plus, you know, the damn thing's FREE. Kind of hard to beat that price, especially since they stripped out the grinding aspects that usually come with F2P games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember using the separate launcher away from Steam, and logging in so many hours into this game. It's a shell of its former self now, however, with the removal of classes, removed base upgrades, the credit equips, bizarre weapon rebalancing, and now the inability to make a new account. Despite the last bouts of updates, Hi-Rez seems to have already abandoned this game a while back to focus on their more recents projects like Smite and Paladins. One can only hope that either a new Tribes game or the upcoming title Midair can recapture that wonderful, extremely fast-paced action I experienced several years ago.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gotta go fast. Achieve speeds of over 400 KM/H over the flag stand in order to achieve victory. Or spend the entire game sitting in the generator room as a fat♥♥♥♥♥tank farming easy kills. Or spend the entire game literally acting as a human meat shield physically body blocking incoming cappers much more talented than you without lifting a finger. Whichever role suits you best, this game is 10/10 casual and competitive gameplay. Does your team suck? Screw the objective and go kill people. Is your team coordinated and awesome? Use an extremely in depth built in system of communication in the form of chat trees in order to implement extremely precise coordinated offensive attacks to clear the enemy flag stand for your premier hero capper and shut out the other team. MLG 360 noscope blu pl8 specials. Clutch plays and genuinely ""OHHHHHHhh!!!!!"" moments are the norm in this game. If you like fast paced arena style shooters with unlimited skill cielings that revolve around movement, this game is for you. If you like to ignore the fact that you could be skiiing around at over 500 KM/H and sit like a god damn hen on the flag stand instead, this game is for you. If you want to disregard any kind of team based objective style gameplay and just kill people, this game is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I absolutely loved this game before the patch, the patch makes everything more confusing. I get what you tried to do Hi-Rez but you honesly lost me as a player with the patch. The bullet timings are improved in the patch and theres a lot more balanced weapons now. Rather than patch the game after 2 years and completely mess it up, shouldn't you have just made a new game?  It's about that time after all. If you liked tribes before you will still enjoy this fast paced shooter but to those that grew fond of the elements first presented in tribes ascend, this game will now just irritate you as nothing is even close to what it used to be. GG Hi-Rez, you lost me as a regular player with over 800 hours. The patch might just take some getting used to and I'm just salty cause it's not what I've wasted a lot of time and a few dollars on, but so far I am not impressed by what I see other than bullet speed improvements. Players get too many guns to the point where the classes are rendered useless and you can have a heavy armor with snipers and never know. It adds a whole new element to the game which is nice, but overall its just $hit in my opinion as of right now. I would still recommend it as there is still no other game out there like this, and being free to play it'd be dumb not to atleast try it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Surprisingly rewarding movement for its lofty nature. Tribes: Ascend will satisfy those who are apt to play it and gratify those who stay long enough to learn how to play it.Being that it is multiplayer Tribes: Ascend has netcode, and though all netcode is merely compensatory, which hinders this projectile-heavy game. Weapons fired in this game are delayed by ping and as such client-based actions do not determine the actions of the character leaving the player interactions with definitive inconsistencies.

												Tribes Ascend was an awesome game. I was playing it long before it made it's way onto steam but sadly Hi-Rez has decided to quit updating it in favor of Smite as I assume they figured they can make more money off that game instead. Although this game was free to play or as some say ""Pay 2 Win"" I'd have to disagree with the later part as the game required a good bit of fps skill to play and someone that just bought all the equipment could still be stomped on by a more skilled player.But with the game long out of date and less than 150 players active I'll have to sadly say I would not recommend trying it out now as you would have missed the ""glory days""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, I may have 8.3 hours playtime on Steam, but I have well over 1000 hours outside steam that I've built up mainly from 2012/2013.Tribes Ascend has gotten quite a few negative reviews lately which I believe is very unfair. This mainly stems from Hi-Rez being very unpridictable and the playerbase seems to be worried they will drop the game at any time. This isn't going to happen. They released a major patch in December 2015 and have been patching since. They removed the starting grind and simplified weapon loadouts to make the game less complex. Tribes Ascend can be very difficult at first because there really is nothing like it (well.. at the time of launch there wasn't). The mechanics take an hour or two to get used to, and the maps will take some learning to figure out the best paths to take, but after a few hours you will without a doubt be captuing some flags.No other game has brought me more satisfaction of capturing a flag or killing an enemy. Because the controls are so obscure, when you master them and start kicking♥♥♥♥♥ you really get a kick out of it. No other game will make me scream and shout with delight when it goes my way. Another fun part is that dying is okay. It's nearly important so that you can respawn and get a better path etc.Yes, the population on the servers is a litter lower than it once was but there are still plenty of new players with a strong core community. Tribes is without a doubt in my top 3 list of all time favorite games. I highly recommend you try it out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a fast past FPS game that requires teamwork, the game sets it self apart from other FPS games out there. You will ski around at speed outmaneuvering each other. Shooting requires a whole other way of aiming than any other shooter you probably know. You need quick reaction, intuition and a steady aim while you your self is on the move. This game is easy to play, but freakishly hard to master. Early on you will be steamrolled all over the place by the skilled players (even on lowranked server due to high-ranked players re-rolling to play on low ranked servers). It will be frustrating, but with a bit of practice you will learn how to move to prevent being trashed all the time. Movement is really, really, really, important.Btw, Did I mention how important movement is to survive in the game?Standing still will turn you into mincemeat in no time (camping = death).In the normal random game you can do whatever you like, more or less, but if you join a “PickUpGroup” (play a pug) game, you will be put in the setting of competitive gaming. It is recommended and a ton of fun. They will teach you how to play properly. Just tell them that you are new and need to learn ;) Try it out. It is worth it.The downside……Hi-Rez got greedy. When their DotA clone turned profitable, they removed all support for Tribes. The game is now dead in the eye of the maker and only the players are left to fence for them self. And because of this, the game is in a decline and will die out sooner or later, depending on how stubborn the game-community is.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I first played Tribes: Ascend 3 or 4 years ago on its official site I got hooked to it pretty fast and it even became one of those games that you could play and forget a little thing called the time. The game is really fast paced for those of you that have not played it reccomend that if you are the type of gamer that can lose there temper very easily on an online game and you like to blame it on lag then this would not be the game for you simply cause most of the players Have mastered the tragectory system meaning that they could probably predict where you are going to land or where you are going to run or ski off to and shoot a grenade at your feet from across the map. Now when i stopped playing this game my old computer fryed itself and i nearly got completly got engrossed in consol games and had completly forgot about tribes until a few days ago but could not remember the name at all until a friend that played it before said it was on steam. Now while i was downloading this i thought my preowned Toshiba laptop that i got for less than £200 wont be likley to handle this at all well tribes proved me wrong it has never lagged on me at all so far and i find that outstanding considering that TF2 lags all the time until ive been on the server for a few minutes. I feel that its unfortunate that the communilty of tribes ascend has remained so small cause if it got pretty big we would be looking at one of the biggest free to play fps games competing alongside tf2 which wasnt even originally free and many more. Ive noticed that they have only updated  a couple of times since they brought the game out to the online comunity and ive also seen people question or speculate on it but i say where did they need to improve. Now i noticed that they reduced the blast radius and damage of explosives and I would suggest a tribe customization and that would represent the players clan. But please HiRez Studios if any of you read this review please only take the suggestion if there is a boost on players in the steam and web community. I cant really think of anything bad about this game other than the auto balance system for teams i often find myself killing allot in one game then getting killed all the time in the next match I feel that this might be the only thing that could be driving people away from this game.

												Came in, saw it, downloaded it, opened it, made an account, picked a guy with a gun, saw another guy with a gun, got shot by the other guy with a gun, fiddled around with different classes for a half hour, took stealth, stole the flag, spent three minutes skiing away from a bunch of guys with guns who wanted to kill me, got killed, respawned, did it again.

												It's good again guys.Quick Pro-Con LostPRO:-The movement. I mean god damn, does it put games like Titianfall and the latest cawadoody entry to shame. The entire game is played with an exo-suit that makes you feel like you've got an ACME rocket-powered skatboard welded to your feet at all times. With the hilly structure of nearly all of the maps, it's like the worlds most dangerous skate park - but with guns and Capture the Flag.-The weapons. Don't expect too many traditional pew pews in Tribes. This game is fought primarily with high-velocity explosive frisbees. Spinfusors are the name of the game, and learning to use one is easy, but eyeballing the trajectory, distance, and speed of your enemy as they go screaming across the map and scoring a hit is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to master. Weapon variety is enough to keep you happy, and each one has it's own little purpose.-The classes. Old Tribes players will disticntly remember nine in total, but with recent updates it's been shaved down to three; light, medium, and heavy. Don't worry, this is probably my favorite new feature, as it allows more creativity in creating them. Classes are simple, light means go fast, heavy means big armor, and medium is a balance between the two. With the new additions, you can really carve out your niche in the match. Want to have some heavy offensive ordinance AND be able to deploy a turret now? You can. Want to carry a crossbow and a Jackal at the same time? No more class restriction on that. Chaingun AND Heavy spinfusor AND Fractal Grenade? Yep, that too. The sky's the limit.-The graphics. Not on par with a triple-A 2016 release but still really pretty if you crank everything up to max, and can still be set low enough to play on a toaster. The gameplay is the focus here.-It's free. What more could you want?SO-SO-Cannot be played through Steam, so your favorite dank meme name is a no-go.-Serves can get a bit underpopulated, but that's not bad in my opinion becaue you see a few famailiar faces from time to time.CON:-Learning curve is a bit frusturating. 20 hours in and I'm still getting my behind kicked.-May be dead as a doornail in a year or two.-I can't think of anythig else.

												In the beginning (2012) there was hype for whatever reason.Tribes: Ascend was DOA out of beta.It had been slowed down, perks were never considered for balance issues, weapons were released (practically weekly) too often and without any sense of incorporation in to the already existing product and were altered from being overpowered to useless in their short lifespans.Then 2015 ""Out of the Blue"", which is more like ""Out of the Beta"" since the game is now truly 'out of beta' considering that the ""OOTB patch"" is the ""Definitive Incarnation"" of Tribes: Ascend.The games speeds were sped up across the board... In the sense that everyone can go fast, even heavies.Now everyone has the broken perk 'Survivalist' so you can play Quake style TDM 'camp the healthkits' in every game mode and there's a large chunk of players who firmly believe that the game being slowed down like this is just the single most eSports thing to happen to T:A.Also with 'Survivalist' integration you have infinite ammo management added to your list of things to do as a player which is supposedly not ""Crutch"", because being able to endlessly fire weapons adds a lot to online FPS games. It's not like managing resources, like ammo, and health, and energy, and shields, really adds any depth to a game.Can't spell ""Fun"" without 'irony'.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Loyal playerbases don't like change, even though sometimes its for good.There are a lot of bad reviews after the big patch but it did fix a lot of problems for the casual player. Most flaws and imbalances from before were treated with a ""lol git gud"" response from the elite and toxic playerbase that was pushing newbies away. Its a great time to play again, its balanced, rewards skill, and enough players in any region to get a good pick up game. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is great I can't find anything opposite to say but the developers aren't working hard.If a developer sees this then I should tell you that making a good game isn't enough.. You have to support the product you make regardless of their price or their capability.. Please work a bit harder because many people can't even enter the game because of the same crash; so make an update,reassemble graphics do something so people can play and you can earn money and hear less thing about how you sit down and watch football..

												This game is more or less dead by its own devices and abandoned by its developers. It had a horrible F2P model (which got changed WAY too late in its life), balancing that is anything but (automatic weapons being the biggest offender in killing player interest), ""classes"" that are poorly defined to the point that they are almost indistinguishable from each other, and honestly just doesn't really offer anything that you probably haven't experienced (likely in a better form) from its prior incarnations, or other shooters for that matter (old school or *modern*) It had potential, but this potential was never really developed.EDIT 9/22/15: And I wouldn't hold out hope for the balance patch that is supposedly in the works that was supposed to have come out back in 2012.

												(NEW) Game is playable again! Classes and perks stripped down to three basic classes: Heavy, medium and light, all basic weapons available at master level. The specialty weapons are unlockable with xp or gold as usual, but they're no better than the standard weapons, just specialized. If you spent xp before with your account, it has been reimbursed due to the heavy changes to the game.If you're having trouble running the game through steam, run the highrez installer in the tribes:ascend exe folder, let it uninstall then run it again to reinstall it in another folder preferably. Now you can run it through steam!(OLD)People seem to confuse ""pay4lazy/aesthetics(which are pointless as a tiny spec) with pay4unfair advantage.You can say this game is pay2notgrind, but that's boring. Paying unlocks all the perks, classes and weapons that are unlockable anyway by fighting matches. When you git gud at this game,  no paying idiot will ever be a match for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It has very fun to play classes AND it's free to play. If I were to rate it I'd give it 150/100. It's super fun to play with friends, so encourage lots of people to download it.

												Here is a revised summary of the below:+F2P+Fast game+Excelent movement system- somewhat pay to win- people who pay will cream people who don't, so yeah pay to win- the aim is the most f***ing slugish I have ever used. (I don't know if others have this problem or how it can be fixed)It's an excelent game but EXTREMELY hard to masterthe cross hair has a good deal of lagg with the mouse, with or without good pingI'd say this game is BETER THAN HALO (ce) IF they fix the aimer-mouse laggget it while it's still free!the following is just details of the game:it's a first person shooter where you ""shoot em up"" (in a nutshel) but it also has multipul gamemodes (about 6) and multipul charactars (9) each with multipul unlockable weapons (3-9)this game also an amazing movement system3 different veihicles, tank, jet, low gravity bike + jetpack and ""ski""Ski is just going frictionless so you can acheive great speed downhill and use your jet pack up hillthe tank is strait forward, high power excplosive shot with slow reloadthe jet has a high speed but can be stationary and fires lower power explosisvesand the bike (my favorite) hovers above the ground and is the fastest thing in the entire game even minus the boost you can use! it allows you to go up hill pretty fast and then just glide off the other side covering emense distance in short period of time.there i so much more in the game asside from what I said so jst go for it!45% (unless I can fix the aim thing, then 95%)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you like chainwh*ring? Do you like abandonning any weapon that needs predictive aiming skill to use? Do you like spamming stupid autokill orbital strikes for a cheap kill?This game is for you then.Graphics. For very well done graphics and visuals. Unfortunantly this is not what makes a good person shooter. In fact the visual crap and doo-dads actually got on my way in combat. We know everyone ignores visual effects after about 10 minutes into the game anyways.Level design. Most of the levels are too close together. I suppose they HAD to do this since a larger map on high graphics would bring most pre-2010 video cards to their knees.Balance and gameplay. The weapons are ALL over the place and the discfuser and showcklance are on the back burner in leu of the plethera of submachineguns and assualt rifles. This is not Call of Duty, this is Tribes where aiming is HARD and predicting where you target is - is paramount. Did not seem a Tribes game to me at all. What happens when you make certain weapons really easy to use and really easy to get kills with is that the hard core, GOOD players leave the game entirely and the inexerienced kiddies and man-children move in. Then they brag about how they so owned you with a SMG from 130 meters. Yeah, it's like that.Beta Tester support. Let's face it, Hi-Res spent most of their time on Smite and left Tribes:Ascend out in the cold. When Beta Testers spent up to $50-$60 on buying suits and weapons (something that should have been FREE), one year later Hi-Res crapped on them when they said ""Everything unlocked! Sale for $20!"". Yeah, I felt cheated after spending $50 in Beta unlocking HALF THE STUFF. Final note:I LOVE the Tribes game series. Starsiege, Tribes 2 and maybe even Tribes Veangeance (if only for the really single player campaign) are close to my gaming heart. What Hi-Res did this franchise put the nail in the coffin of this game concept that had so much promise.Hi-Res did to Tribes what George Lucas did to Star Wars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pollished, it would be a geat game! But as many other reviewers have pointed out, Hi-Rez Studios has stopped updating and patching it. It would probably be okay if they cut their work-force into sections, working on different games rather than just one, but they seem to want to throw their assets all at their MOBA (Which I think is sad that it's not on Steam... I actuall could use my wallet here for ""skins"" and gods...)My recomendation: If you're giving it a shot, go ahead! It's still a fun, yet frustraiting game! However, I would caution you to play a ""hat sim"" or other arena shooter that is actually maintained.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tribes: Ascend is a good way to waste some time.  It has complex and interesting maps, and while there is a steep learning curve for weapons in the game, it's far more rewarding than in other games to get a kill.  Sadly, it is clearly a game developed around microtransactions, and it takes an absurd amount of time to get that one weapon you've been eyeing.  Due to that fact, the majority of players have moved on from Ascend, and it's slowly fading out.  While not a bad game in its own right, due to the recent lack of players and neglect from the developers, I can't recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game, dare i say, is probably one of the best first person shooters F2P I have played to date. The graphics are good, the gameplay is incredible and teamwork is essential. Controlling the massive speeds of 200 Kph is intense at first but soon becomes second nature as your main focus is blowing the heads off enemies using multiple different guns. This was my favourite, topping that of Planetside 2 and TF2 for a while. This game was never too popular which was a absolute shame! No one really played it because it wasn't advertised well enough i think. If you're looking for a adrenaline pumped action fps where everything is pushed to the limit, this is a game for you.

A Paladin’s Review: Tribes: Ascend: Out of the Blue Update. High Speed Fun and Spinfusors for the Win.Genre: Sci-Fi First/Third Person Shooter, Multiplayer Only High Speed Armor Based.Developed & Published by: Hi-Rez StudiosPlatform: Windows only.DRM: Free Hi-Rez Player Account Required. Steam is optional.Business Model: Free to Play System. Optional purchases for cosmetic skins, different voices or a weapons pack that unlocks all weapons, perks, items and loadouts immediately.Played over 100 hours and bought some gold. Most of my playtime is in the non-Steam client. Read this review in its entirety with screenshots and the OST from Bandcamp on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Game OverviewTribes: Ascend is a multiplayer-only online arena high-speed first person shooter. It’s an everlasting factional warfare between the Blood Eagles and Diamond Swords set in the distant future. These tribes are battling it out for ultimate supremacy in a futuristic Sci-Fi universe where the fighting seems unlikely to stop anytime soon. In-game, this simply affects the color of your armor, the announcer’s voice and where you spawn. Three different armor bases form the basis of what a player can and can’t do at any one time. There are a wide variety of different weapons ranging from explosive projectile weapons, hitscan assault weapons to sniper rifles and more. There are five distinct game modes and more than 40 maps combined spanning these modes. These maps are huge, allowing for high speed build up and action on a giant battleground. Each map is designed with its mode in mind and only share the general aesthetics. There is an official rule set for each mode but you can also set up your own server with custom rules. T:A sets itself apart from other first person shooters with high speed skiing, jet pack action and projectile preference over hitscan weapons. It’s free-to-play which means that T:A has a decent variety of skins and voice packs to customize your look as well. Is it worth checking out? Well, let’s talk about the shooting elements next.Gameplay MusingWith the Out of The Blue Patch, Hi-Rez has clearly shown that it has learned from the mistakes of the past. The huge amount of grinding is gone, the weapon play feels more balanced than it ever has in the past and Tribes is fun to play again. Despite its quirks and imperfections, Tribes still has something to offer after three years. It’s hard to deny the rush you get when you’re skiing at 300 km/h across the map while dodging all sorts of projectiles thrown your way. The increased flexibility with loadouts makes for a much more interesting play/counterplay setup if the rest of your team is on the ball. I’m not 100% sold on the current weapon or armor balance right now. It’s definitely better than it used to be but some of them, like the bolt launchers, feel superfluous or heavies are a little too good. However, it’s no longer a hitscan nightmare fest that it used to be. Where paid players had a clear advantage over free players. I’ll be curious to see how patches over the months and possibly years go. So far, they seem to be keeping the game going at a regular, if slow, pace. Development CycleHi-Rez returned in December to give T:A a much needed overhaul in balance and several new maps for players. But that will probably be the exception to the norm. Since then, there’s been smaller bug fix patches, a new map here and there and minor balance changes to address community complaints. Tribes: Ascend seems to be a passion project for Hi-Rez and as such I would temper one’s expectation of regular content. Unfortunately, the Out of the Blue update did not create a substantially larger player base. There was a big jump in players when they announced the patch, but it has since returned to the normal small levels it had before the patch. Even so, the game is playable now without the major issues that used to plague it. I’d say you’ll get about 5-8 public servers going on any particular day. So, there’s always something to do. For now, it seems like Hi-Rez plans on supporting the game for the foreseeable future with small updates to keep the game going.PC Settings and Audio/VideoGame Options:What the User Can Configure:Resolution Options: Standards IncludedCategorized by: 16:9, 16:10, 4:3 and Other.Graphics & Texture Detail: Selection SliderMinimal, Low, Medium, High and Very HighV-Sync changeable.

Many of the balance problems are fixed, the large amount of grinding is gone, the business model feels a lot more fair and there’s more content to enjoy. Capture the Flag is clearly the focal point of T:A and its still really fun to play. This is the best state the game has ever been in despite its flaws. The community is still pretty decent too. However, said community is small and may not grow anytime soon unfortunately. There are some aspects of balance that may need to be adjusted as time goes on and I would like to see more content released. It’s also got a pretty difficult learning curve compared to most shooters that can be daunting for new players wanting to experience T:A. While I’ve never gotten particularly great at it, I always try to and its got a challenge that I still find compelling. Its a game whose mechanics, speed and shooting still stand up even after three years of gaming. I definitely recommend checking out Tribes: Ascend especially after this patch that came out of the blue.

Decided to review it here finally.Even though it's been stated before by many: A superb and unique game that's been abandoned for way too long.

												Holy crap this is awful. Servers are horrible, my ping would jump from the 60's to 800's. I would be doing fine chasing someone and shooting at them, and then all of a sudden I'm ahead of them shooting at a mountain, and then rubber band back to where I shot an explosive, and it would actually place me in the explosion radius of something I shot five seconds before. I'd rubber band back and forth, and even side to side, literally going in a straight line across a flat surface, and after a couple of rubber bands, find myself five to twenty feet to the left or right of my original path. I don't know how anyone can functionally play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Download it! It's free and it's the best CTF you'll find anywhere.The unique part of this game is skiing (making the ground frictionless), a rechargeable jet pack, and weapons you shoot inherit your velocity.  All of that combines together to make just moving around the map fun and gives the most dynamic game of CTF around.Also, the developers just started supporting it again after almost 3 years so consider it un-abandonned as of Dec 2015 since most reviews point this out.

												This game was good when it was still under development.However, it seems that the Developer Hi-Rez Studios has abandoned it as it was not really economically supporting the company as it didn't had a consistent number of players.Erez Goren himself once said on Reddit that Smite brings in more $$$ for them and that's why they chose to stop development  for Tribes which is very sad and disappointing especially for the Loyal Players and VIPs who've supported them for a year or more till Smite came out(and development stopped.)Tribes: Ascend is now left in a really unstable and bug filled state(with quite a number of hackers and an Asia server shut down - Singapore i believe). Stay away from this game and do not, i repeat, do not buy the GOTY Edition if you played this game before already or not cos' there aren't many servers to play this on anyways(30-40 servers/day, many empty).Boo to you Hi-Rez, for ruining the fun for many Tribes: Ascend players in favour of a ""money-making, cash cow"" game.Signing off,HunterSlayer ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tribes is a Free2Play First Persion Shooter with a unique gameplay twist: the main means of transportation are your jetpack and your ski. Yes, you read that right: your (energy-) ski! This aspect defines the entire game and poses the main difference to other games. The Tribes series was always centered around the gamemode ""Capture the Flag"" and offers fast and frantic battles, where aiming is as important as maneuvering the terrain:

There are 9 different classes (light to heavy) with class-specific weapons, items, perks and killstreaks. Most weapons shoot explosive rounds, which are quite useful for highspeed battles. The light classes are the fastest on the battlefield and are designed for attack maneuvers, while the heavy classes are mostly designed for defending your flag / base / domination-spot. There are also 3 different vehicles that can be bought with points (from kills and objectives) on some maps. The video below shows some weapons in action:

												It's Tribes. If you loved the series, you'll get some mileage out of it. But for everyone else, the time has already passed.The game mechanics are solid, and it's still very much an enjoyable shooter. If you do get into it, look for the GOTY pack on sale, as it'll give you more than enough content for your money, and is much preferred to the grind or solo purchases.That said, HiRez dropped support for this (among their other games) to focus on Smite, their new money-maker. While I can't entirely blame them, it still sucks. And with Tribes, it shows... the servers are mostly empty (though you can usually get a few games in without much wait) and there are no more updates.While a lot of fun at its core, due to the ended support, lack of care from HiRez about the game and grind needed to get into it... for all by the most desperate for some Tribes-y action (I think there's an original Tribes resurgence, so go look at that instead), Tribes: Ascend is sadly a pass.

												I had never played any of the other games in the Tribes series when I decided to play Tribes: Ascend.I had no idea what to expect.I had heard it was pretty fast paced. I was wrong. I had heard it had a steep learning curve. I was wrong. The fact of the matter is that Tribes: Ascend might just be the most frantic, fast-paced FPS experiences you will ever encounter. The learning curve is not just steep, it is like a big wall that goes straight up and then (due to the massive amounts of gravitational pressure) bend backwards at the top. At least that's what it felt like to a newbie like me.They say that the best things in life are free. Tribes: Ascend is pretty darn fun, just get it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an amazing game, extremely balanced and fair. Its F2P system is absolutely functional and logical, as it easily allows for the more determined players to have access to all weaponry by merely playing it without grind, yet, if haste is needed, Steam offers the Game of the Year Edition which unlocks everything and is pretty cheap, and once in a while it can be acquired for a ludicrously low price due to the famous sales Steam is known for. I don't have the proper words to convey how great this game is: it's unique, SKILL-BASED, requires precise team coordination for competitive matches. This is a masterpiece and its originality sets it apart from its own genre. It's a must for FPS lovers and hardcore players that value practice and skill.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi-Rez don't care about Tribes anymore, and probably never did.  What you will find if you play this is a ""skill-based"", unbalanced, massively unfair, OP auto, not rewarding of the skillful experience that will just frustrate you.  It was good once, but now Tribes is at an ""okay"" at best.  New players and T2 fans, I would not recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In truly was.One of the best ever right up-there in the podium with the counter-strike series.And then the SMGs and Assault Rifles came along, cancelling all the skill-based nature of the game and turning it into another CoD-clone with jetpacks and skis.I told the devs back then that they should ditch those or nerf them into oblivion if they didn't want to see their game die within a year.They didn't listen, and the game died within a year.

												Played this game ages ago and thought I would give it a try again. Safe to say its got the same problem which caused me to quit in the first place, once you get to level 10++ you get dumped into the ""Big Boy"" zones.Here you will get your butt kicked and handed to you by people who have no life (they get so salty when you managed to kill them in some way) and have been playing this game for ages. The balence in this game is awefull to say the least.It strikes me as very poor when you are level 11 and paired against people who are 40++. New players will enjoy this game at the start but around lvl 10 will drop off.Some players are aslo cheap as ♥♥♥♥, by partying with a low level player then barge into the lvl 1 ~ 10 games and wreck everything including your fun.

												Tribes Ascend tries to revive and renew the long history of tribes games. However the game is quite dumped down and does not really deliver. Tribes was always a ver niche game and got its experience from mechanics that are not really compatible with the broad mass of players (it was no game you could pick up easily). By triing to make it mass compatible it is loosing much of its appeal and uniqueness.However , after abandoning the game for 2 years, HighRez is making an effort to renew the game. Lets see how long it will last and whether they can make it tribes again.Recommended because of hope dies last.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tribes: Ascend is a free-to-play game (though money is needed for some features) which surpasses all expectations one could have for a shooting game. Most shooting games put the players in a slow-paced environment where the desire to move quicker than 7 mph is not an option. In this game, if you're moving slower than that, it's because you're standing still.This game requires a good aim, reflex, tracking, and anticipation. Most of your gameplay will require that you anticipate. There are enormous hills all over the place, and between the ""skiing"" and jetpack abilities, there's really no way you'll have to NOT anticipate before shooting.It also features several cameos and essences I really enjoy, even one relating directly to Sonic the Hedgehog (the best video game series ever). Several voices and  statements and whatnot from prior games were dragged into this game, and better yet, you can control the exact statement you use, unlike previous games in the Tribes series.As a First-Person Shooter game, I give it a 10/10, hands down. Most shooters I play get around 5/10. As a video game altogether, I give it 9/10, graphics and physics and originality and whatever else factors all considered. From a PERSONAL standpoint, I give it a 6/10. It's something I like to play, but not very often. Games are meant for fun, aaaaaaaaaand that's how I tend to rate games on a personal level. This game is a LOT of fun, especially to someone who hasn't played a Tribes game in 9 years or so when they find out this one is free. VGW			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is free to play. I generally hate free to play because ""free to play"" usually means ""pay/grind to win"". As a long-time tribes fan (since tribes 1), this put me off almost as much as tribes:vengeance did. However I gave it a shot.Its actually VERY good. It would be perfect if it wasn't F2P (I would gladly pay full price upfront for all content) but the F2P here isnt that intrusive - you can get by decently without much grinding.This game IS tribes. The jetpacks, disc launchers, and voice binds. Flying over hills at ridiculous speeds and landing a midair hit on someone is really.♥♥♥♥ing.satisyfing. The adrenalin rush of being the flag carrier with 5 enemies chasing you at crazy speeds; it was a dopamine/nostalgia overload on my first play.In hindsight, this game needed to be F2P/grind based in order to build a large enough community to keep the servers worth playing in. I only wish they added more CTF maps.Definitely try this out (or you're missing out).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well what is there to say about this game? Sadly sice the game of the year edition was released this means one thing; cashing out. I doubt there will be any new major content or new maps to be honest. But should you get this game just cause it is addicting and pretty fun to play. There are some horrible disadvantages to this game:If you're a new player good luck ranking up cause most likely you'll be going up against more experienced playersRanking up is slow and pretty tediousIt is kind of a pay to win game (Pay money and unlock weapons much easier/ faster)Some of the weapons which are ungodly on the battlefield require 20,000+ xp or an easy 250 gold (Pay to win here)Very challenging and aiming is pretty dificult at the startHave to buy classes with 4,500 xp (4,500 xp is not hard to get)Now they are great redeeming factors to this game:Super fast pacedChallenging but really rewading when you land awesome mid airs on players moving faster than vehiclesA good variety of weapons, perks, loadouts, and specific play styles to classesClasses are fairly balanced (But with right weapons, player, and perks; classes can become unkillable and really broken)Vehicles to add something more to the gameMaps are awesome and layed out pretty nicely (In CTF a team can have a slight advantage depending on team or ""tribe"")The serversFor me servers have been decent and I haven't had too many issues. Occasional lag spikes and rubber banding but thats something we have to deal with anyways. Oh yeah there are different ranked servers. Novice for the lower levels and regular for the higher players. Higher leveled players cannot join Novice servers unless they join a friend through the in game social system. Once you ""leveled out"" of the novice servers welcome to dealing with level 30+ players and you'll be fairly miniscule compared to them. When you are ""too good"" for the Novice servers that is when the game falls of a steep cliff and die. Most servers are sadly empty so good luck finding any action. Novice servers are the only ones that have players in it, but remember you're leveled out.So should you get this game? If you really like fast paced challenging gameplay then pick it up. The thing is though early game will be painful as you will be left with weapons that very ""basic"" and aren't good or bad. Aquiring weapons, classes, perks, and anything will take a long time. Servers are nice, but the leveling and ranking involved with joining is stupid.I like this game and I still enjoy it today.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR (even tho this isn't long anyway): Tribes theoretically is a waste of time on the long term, but you should have at least tried it and seen the awesome, unique mechanics this game introduced. If you've got time to spare and feel like playing around for a couple hours, this'll do great. You might get disappointed/sad once you realise how much♥♥♥♥♥♥the devs did outside of gameplay.Tribes probably wrote the saddest FPS story I've witnessed.It's so sad, I'm not gonna make a long explanation out of it. It's a story of how the most promising and fun gameplay concepts got overshadowed by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dev decisions, especially outside of direct gameplay.My actual recommendation: At least try this game, if you haven't. Why? Because you should have seen it. I don't think it's an actually recommendable game on the long term, but compare this game's gameplay to a lame♥♥♥♥♥ boring CoD or whatever (those kind of shooters where the concept clearly is ""shooting > strategies""). Tribes does have a strategic part to it, but the shooting part is done in such a unique and fun way, it's ridiculous. Whenever I play a FPS that's promoted as ""fast"", fun or individual and I try it, all I think is ""well, it's not Tribes"". Hardly any game has similarly entertaining and unique mechanics in it. Balance issues, a kind of p2w system, no mod support and updates that didn't add♥♥♥♥♥♥to the game make me not want to play this anymore, but I'll never forget the ♥♥♥♥ing sick concepts and potential this game had.

												It's a little less entertaining now, to say the least.The developers no longer support the game, the community (not all, but most) is entirely too aggressive towards one-another, and the learning curve to enjoy the game properly is too steep for the average individual to even want to try playing.I can still say it was one hell of a lot of fun while it lasted, just not as much as it was in 2012.

												This game is a free fast-paced FPS with mostly ballistic weapons and awesome movement mechanics including jetpacks and a complete friction loss from the ground. And because gliding + hills + speed + ballistic weapons = hard to hit, this game is difficult. And awesome.Now to get a little more precise, the movement can be compared with the little iOS game tiny wings, where you slide through the little gaps between round hills and fly around as fast as you can, but this is 3D. The weapons are mostly in one of these 3 categories: Explosive weapons fire slowly, have rather slowly flying projectiles with splash damage and extreme damage on a direct hit, while bullet based guns (autos) fire rather fast flying little projectiles dealing high damage per second if you manage to hit all shots and the usually weakest but easy to aim hitscan weapons, which work as all guns do in ""modern shooters"". You point at an enemy and when you click, they die.As you may have guessed, to be good at the game you should be able to handle guns from the first category, which are the way it's meant to be played and the only real honorable option (Debatable, I know, discuss it on reddit or whatever). The fast movement is hard to control in the beginning and hitting fast people with ballistic weapons can be extremely hard. This is what puts game's skill ceiling so high.The community is not as big as it used to be, by now the game is slowly dying ( http://steamcharts.com/app/17080#All ). Still, there's always enough EU servers filled to join in a suitable game for me, so I will be enjoying the game for a long time. The good players are friendly to each other, the few toxic parts of the community are found in low-level servers and quit plaing sooner or later. Your first matches will be on these novice servers, although you will soon reach level 10 just to be thrown into games with the seasoned veterans when you know little about the game but the basics. This makes it even harder for new players.So, to come to a conclusion:The game is awesome, but difficult.We can use more new players learning with each other instead of getting wrecked by pros, so give it a try.What you can have for free is one of the best multiplayer shooters out there.Prepare to get owned! Don't be frustrated, it's bound to happen.Continue playing and think about what you do, learn from the enemy and you will get better.Have fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played the game since the Beta and let me tell you something, as of now, it's completely dead.If you are lucky to get in the only server that actually has people, you are in for a treat, otherwise, you'll get bored of chasing the guy with the smurf account that caps the flag and goes running around because it's a 2 v 2 and you'll never get him, no matter how good at the game you are.The developers decided to focus on Smite, because they are nothing more than a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that are interested in making as much money as possible.If, and only if, this game is ever open sourced to the community, we'll get back the thrill.Nevertheless, it's a great game, with a great concept, decent execution and good graphics.

												I liked this game. Like a lot. But then I decided to get Smite as well. Also made by Hi-Rez Studios. Got Smite, but never played it or Tribes: Ascend. Decided to start up Tribes one day. Got an error message saying ""This game must be launched through Steam"" even though that's what I had done in the first place. Launcher for Tribes still starts up but there are missing textures, and there is a static progress bar labeled: Connecting to authentication servers, or somthing of the sort. Trys to relaunch game. Same thing happens. Tries reinstalling it. Same thing happens. Tries uninstalling Smite. Same thing happens. Tries reinstalling Tribes again. Launcher actually works to some extent, but with the same missing texture problem. After installing, I launch the game. Missing gui and textures everywhere. Cursor does not appear. Most likely due to missing textures as well. Manages to join session of Capture the Flag. Models are there but all the textures are gone. Manages to exit game feeling very dissapointed. Goes to store page to write this review. Decides to reinstall the game once more after the review is done. Ok, now I really like this game, and that is the reason I still reccomend it. But this problem needs to be fixed. I'm not sure if the textures didn't download correctly and the launcher didn't notice the problem, or if they were somehow put in the wrong folder in the game directory, but I'm fairly certain that this has happened to at least one other person in the world. Thank you for reading this review. Spread the word to your friends, and tell them to tell their friends and their friends will tell their friends and so on. Tell them that they are not alone in the world of bugs, and glitches, and mishaps in programming. Tell them that help is (hopefully) coming from the developers. Thank you, and goodbye.

Go pick it up now and if you rage before you are lvl 11 then you should play it still... If you still rage after lvl 11 (couse that is the breake point of when you can get most of the calsses, guns, stuff, skill) then yea, its not a game for you, or you are still really bad at it!!!ITS FREEEEEEE...

												A great game full of action and fast paced gameplay but best of JETPACKS! There are so many fun game modes that you can play with and many different loadouts and classes to choose from. Most people I've seen review this game say it is a pay to win game but it seems like you can get almost anything the paid players have if you just put enough time and effort into the game, the only thing you can't get is the custom skins and voices.

												i have played all the previous tribes games. and this one (by far) is the most simplistic and dumbed down version. There is almost no stategy or teamwork left in the series. it is all about aiming and shooting, and there are hundreds of more interesting games that have the same depth. yes there are jetpacks, skiing and slow projectile weapons, but none of benefits of mastering them, because the only way victory is just who is better at aiming. no teamwork, no strategy, and no depth. google ""tribes 2 trailer"" for a small and simplistic example of the strategy that used to be required. even from over a decade ago with sucky graphics, the gameplay exceeded tribes ascend by far.

												Tribes: Ascend is a game with incredible potential, with a genius concept great weapons, and good balance. It could change the way FPS's are made. But unfortionatley it is pay to win. In order to get all the good stuff, you need to pay. And if you don't want to pay, it takes an incredibly long time to get enough XP to get the good stuff. It even takes a while to unlock all the classes. Starts out good, but after a while you realize it's more frustrating than fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've spent over 500 hours on this game, having had no experience with the previous games in the franchise, and I can say one thing about it that I'm completely sure of: It's very, very good.Hirez made a fantastic shooter, that, in spite of its high critical acclaim and praise, never managed to secure an audience large enough to merit its continued development, and caused it to only exist as a ""live"" game for a year after coming out of open beta. The studio got a lot of flak for moving its focus over to another risky endeavour, which is the MOBA Smite, which paid off after Smite saw a lot of commercial success and propelled the studio from a small 20-man staff to employing over 80 people. I recommend playing Tribes: Ascend without hesitation, as it is the best online shooter I've ever played, and in spite of some balancing issues, and lack of studio support, I will continue playing for as long as the servers don't burst into flames and die, at which point the game will probably die too. Go in, have fun, shoot people, and try not to rage too much when hyper-skilled players gun you down with automatic weapons 4 times over. It's a lot of fun if you play it for fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tribes Ascend tries to revive and renew the long history of tribes games. However the game is quite dumped down and does not really deliver. Tribes was always a ver niche game and got its experience from mechanics that are not really compatible with the broad mass of players (it was no game you could pick up easily). By triing to make it mass compatible it is loosing much of its appeal and uniqueness.However , after abandoning the game for 2 years, HighRez is making an effort to renew the game. Lets see how long it will last and whether they can make it tribes again.Recommended because of hope dies last.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bit of a juxtaposition. A good game reminicent of Tribes 2, which I sank 8-10 hours of a day off into, but with more restrictions because of the f2p model. They have a few of the Starsiege: Tribes and T2 maps in there which is good for nostalgia, however, without the ability to mod the game, you won't get the same kind of satisfaction. The devs have stopped updaing T:A in it's entirety, so what you see is what you get and nothing more.Damn shame Hi-Rez abandoned this game for the obvious ""flavour of the month"" MOBA style game, which I'm sure they'll abandon once that cash cow's udders dry up, as this could have been something legendary like it's predecessors.A better free to play game would be Planetside 2, which is more Tribes, than Tribes... oddly. Just make sure your hardware is up for the resource hungry engine. At least the devs at SoE don't abandon their games.(I downvoted because there's no point investing time and money into a game that is no longer being developed, not because the game is bad. Plus, Why would you give a company more money for an IP/Idea that wasn't theirs to begin with, which they've just thrown away?)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like going slow? Don't bother.Problem?EDIT: After many hours, it turns out that Hi-Rez Studios found its other games far more profitable and interesting. It was too expensive from the get go. They never bothered to address this until the game was almost dead. Its really a shame they killed the Tribes franchise. I'll be honest, it is / was a good game. The developers were just terrible at operating it. In example, at one point to puchase a single primary weapon was 10.00 USD. That is absurd. Eventually it got lowered some, then as the game died, they made a get it all pack. Far too late, HiRez. You won't have any of my money.They also stopped addressing gameplay issues and bugs, most of them being weapon balancing. Just look up what happened when the Plasma Rifle was introduced. It was eventually fixed, but from there on out it was a hillarious rollercoaster of balance problems.I have to unfortunately change my review to ""Not Recommend""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, the game looks good and it can be fun to zip around the landscape trying to line up the perfect shot to blow your opponents to bits, but there are just so many things that get in the way of enjoying the game. Some classes feel poorly balanced, the sniper class does less damage than most of the heavy classes, meaning your reward for lining up incredibly difficult shots is almost nonexistant. The 'technician' class seems like it is designed for defends generators and whatnot, but his default weapons are poory suited to dealing with heay/medium armor classes that would attack a generator. It's amost always a good idea to just choose a heavy class, because you live longer and deal the most damage. Supposedly it's balanced through lesser mobility, but that often doesn't matter in the 8 person meelee to pick up a flag or defend an objective.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game has the worst balancing ever in any game ever. EVER. Some weapons to next to nothing while some weapons instakill you. *Cough* *cough* Explosive weapons *cough* *cough*.

												This game is dead. It was once a glorious pinnacle of FPS, but now the magic of skiing while dishing out blue plates and having parties in the gen room are diminished by crutches. If there are ever any custom matches that ban assault rifles, I suggest you give it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tribes: Ascend is a strange case. The game was wonderful once, even I have to dare to call it an example of the perfect FPS. The main game mode was capture the flag and it had a small variety of weapons, including the spinfusor. The spinfusor projectiles could inherit the speed of the user, leading to a desicion from the player: do they go fast and make it more difficult to hit things or slow down and be more difficult to hit. As such, a typical game would be: Defenders set up minimal defences Flag cappers gain enough speed using skis, jetpack and boosters to get past the automated turrets and opposing players Flag carriers cap flag by going fastThe game revolved around the skiing mechanic, in which one could go fast by activating skis down hill but had to use a jetpack uphill. This led to the game being FAST. About a year ago, the developer introduced a speed cap for flag carriers, a change to how inheritence of projectile weapons was calculated, a buff to the heavy classes and then suddenly stopped development of the game altogether because they wanted to hop onto the MOBA bandwagon. I apologise to people who only just heard of this game but it's too late, it's dead now. If there was more marketing other than none whatsoever or it went to Steam earlier maybe people would have jumped on it before it died.STAY CLEAR OF THIS GAME AND ANYTHING ELSE THE DEVELOPER MAKES, THEY ARE GREEDY SCUMBAGS.

												Back in 2012 on my terrible laptop I spotted this game for download. I decided to jump on it at first and I LOVED it. It was fast paced, so many different play styles, a lot of maps for different playing styles. The classes are great, guns are great. Although the game did get abandoned so the developers could work on MOAB style games *cough* Smite *cough* I still enjoyed it. I'd recommend the game for those fast-paced run and gun lovers.

												Since HiRez *FINALLY* released a patch for this game, after two whole years, I figured it was time to patch my review.  While everyone figured they abandoned the game (which, they pretty much did for a while there), they came out of no where with this new patch.  And it puts the feel of the old school Tribes games back in.  Gone are the individual classes, back with just the light/medium/heavy sets and customizable loadouts.  There's been a slew of quality improvements as well as a couple new maps.  I definitely feel like I'm playing a graphically and mechanically updated version of the beloved Starsiege Tribes from the late 90s, which is fantastic.  A lot of F2P games get you with their IAPs and P2W, but even HiRez has admitted they're not going to make money off this patch.  They've basically given the old players everything in the game completely unlocked.  You shouldn't spend more than $10 on the game unless you're just impatient, as it appears everything (except armor skins and voice packs) are unlockable via XP.  I can't not recommend this game to fans of the FPS genre, because the bottom line is it's just that good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just for the record, I have played this before I made my steam profile and I invested ~100 hours into it back then.Tribes: Ascend is very enjoyable game.Dinamic gameplay and loads of adrenaline make this game truly live up to its title; the fastest FPS in the world. Maps are well made and offer many tactical advantages (and disatvantages) as well as very intresting features which make them ""alive"". While playing, you can really feel like you are engaged in entire planet-wide conflict. There are 9 classes in game, 3 light classes, 3 medium classes and 3 heavy classes which have their own way of playing. If you are more agile type of player, you will certanly enjoy navigating rough terrain in the role of pathfinder light class (as well as snatching enemy flag right in front of their noses!). If you seek well rounded and generaly easy to play class, the soldier medium class is for you. Or if you had tough day at work or are just angry about something, you will enjoy tearing enemy base to bits in the role of juggernaut heavy class. Gameplay is, as stated before, dinamic and it is skill based. You don't just shoot like a maniac, you need to predict where your target will be to score a hit. You will always need to keep in mind your energy level and your speed - slow soldier is a dead soldier. Game is not a pay 2 win in any case, you can buy some things for real money but they are cosmetic (skins, voices).However, Tribes: Ascend has its sad and dark side. Player base is getting smaller each day, last update was released 3 years ago beacuse the devs are (for some reason unknown) decided to abandon the game. Once ambitious, glorious game has been thrown into state of decay.All in all, the game offers a lot, its not a mindless shooter or ultra-super-skilled-players-only game, in terms of action, fun, and tactical possibilities, there is no other game that can match Tribes:Ascend.

												A great game.HISTORY:Tribes is an old franchise that goes all the way to 1999 with Starsiege: Tribes. It differentiated itself from other futuristic shooters by having wide open maps, vehicles, class system (similar to what Battlefield 1942 did 3 years later) and jetpacks. Then later on, Tribes 2 came and further expanded on the idea, adding skiing (which is one of the few cases of a bug becoming a core feature of a franchise). It was well received and a couple of years later, Tribes: Vengeance came out and it was the first attempt to try streamlining the formula, however it wasn't well received by fans. And so, Tribes IP languished year after year, at one time developer called GarageGames (who made Fallen Empire: Legions, heavily (by heavily I mean almost completely copied) inspired by Tribes) bought the IP with the intent of remaking Tribes 1 for their InstantAction platform (which might be defunct now), til Hi-Rez bought the rights and set on to develop Tribes: Ascend.BASICS:Tribes: Ascend can be best described as ""Battlefield meets Halo, fast-paced"". It is a first-person shooter which pits teams Blood Eagle between treacherous Diamond Sword, each team can have max. 14 players with 3 armor classes in disposal. It is very team-oriented (as you might've noticed) and each player needs to accomodate and communicate between teammates to win. It's not as easy to learn as other games in the genre, you need to have at least some knowledge of the game, but it is gratifying as you soar into the sky with your jetpack and then ski 200 km/h (or is it mph), get into duels and so on.GAME MODES:There are many game types you can play, however the main type of Tribes: Ascend is Capture-the-flag. Each team fights for other team's flag and 5 captured flags end the game or if the time runs out with the score difference of two or one without other team holding the flag. Team Deathmatch is also widely played and recommended for newbies to try out. There are other game types like CTF Blitz (changing flag positions), Arena (akin to Quake's Clan Arena)... The maps are gorgeous and vast and the action feels really good, with plenty of weapons to wield (which need to be unlocked though).PROGRESS:UPDATE: Completely overhauled experience system. Now it's far easier for newer players to learn the games because pay-to-win elements have been unlocked. Grinding has been removed, everything not cosmetic is unlocked from the start. The whole loadout system has been rebalanced. So kudos to Hi-Rez.CIRCUMSTANCES:The community playing this game is rather small. Hi-Rez cut support for the game a few years back because it was ""complete"" (even though there are still bugs that need some work, Hi-Rez mismanaged the game and consequently many players have left the game, but with the rebalancing I highly recommend that you come back.CONCLUSION:+ Fast-paced action+ Beautiful maps+ A rather successful attempt to modernize the Tribes formula+ Not pay-to-win (anymore)- Small number of players for now- Not as easy to pick up as other FPS'sMy rating:8 / 10P.S. After you play few matches to get a grip on the game, I suggest you to head over to tribesascendwiki.com and tribes.wikia.com for class guides and other information and check out playapug.com for finding pick-up games (organized, but casual games).

												Absolutley fantastic. This is by far the fastest paced shooter I have ever played. Tribes takes a minute to get used to, but once you get down the basics of skiing, you end up having a blast. And it only takes a few rounds to get used to the physics. Tribes is one of those hidden gems, highly underrated. And there is nothing like the feeling of capping the flag at 250+ kph. Truly spectacular.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Edit: DO NOT GET THIS GAME. As of last year, Hi-Rez has stopped all support for this game, and no longer updates nor polices it. The legitimate players have long since quit en masse, leaving only cheaters and hackers to fill the now-sparsely populated servers. I've been meaning to edit this review for a while now, but I've been putting it off for later until today. Hi-Rez has abandoned one game after another to focus on their newest cash grab (at the time of this writing, they're working on Smite).Tribes: Ascend is the fastest FPS game in the market. Everyone is encased in highly mobile power armor that lets them fight at blazing fast speed on the ground or in the air. In this game, a character running and gunning at 100 kph (62 mph for my fellow Americans) is considered slow, and skilled characters can engage in 250+ kph (155 +mph) firefights. To further complicate things, there are very few hitscan weapons in this game, and all of the automatic weapons are projectile based. A fast-paced game with a high skill ceiling.I recommend buying the 90-day XP booster, which is on sale for 1600 gold at the time of this writing (October 22, 2012). A VIP account (one that has paid anything) gets +50% XP. The booster doubles your XP on top of the +50%, for a total of triple XP (+200%) for 90 days and +50% XP once it wears off. You also get a bonus 1,200 XP per day that the XP booster is active, giving you even more XP to spend.Also, on Facebook, you can get 250 gold for liking it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT: The Out of the Blue patch has improved this game immensely, bringing it more in line with Tribes and Tribes 2. However, there still are some balance issues, but much more concerning is the still-dwindling player base. Hi Rez has shown they've not completely forgotten about the game, but now they need to show they're commited to actually making it a good one. Check out all the new changes, and keep an eye on the game. Hopefully things continue to improve.An interesting title that's more a mixed bag than anything. Flashy graphics and unique mechanics provide lots of fun, but the massive xp costs for the countless amount of unlocks turns what would be a solid FPS into a frustrating grind fest. Not to mention, the learning curve is extremely steep; between learning all the weapon behaviors and skiing, there's a rather large barrier of entry for a newcomer. However, the DOTA- and CS-like difficulty is compounded by the xp grind and feeling of helplessness against those who have arguably ""better"" unlocks and more time with the game. Granted, mastering skiing and grinding for the unlocks will certainly keep you coming back, the former being genuinely fun and the latter having the same addictiveness for completionists.The classic F2P microtransation system really forces you to start pumping money in to bolster your arsenal. You'll have so little if you solely unlock through grinding that you're likely to never know what you actually prefer otherwise. For those inclined to do so can use Steam Wallet funds to purchase Tribes Gold in-game. This allows you to unlock weapons, classes and perks much faster than by grinding alone.However, putting money into this does leave a bad taste in your mouth. The game does feel like it's slowly expiring, so spending money on the myriad of arguably better and/or necessary unlocks also quickly kills the desire to play. Having dropped $20 in my 30 hours of play has left me little fulfillment. More often than not, I'll want to play, but the sense of aversion due to the xp grind and complete chaos in pubs keeps me from hitting the play button now.Hackers are both stupidly obvious and game breaking. One will ruin a game entirely; ironically, this is usually the best way to grind xp. Furthermore, despite the potential for large and hectic matches, even the normal 12vs12 games feel sparsely populated, every player preferring to go at it lone-wolf. This frequently results in both team having one or two players with better unlocks capping uninterrupted or camping your generator. The only time it feels like people are truly working together is when it's hardcore players stomping your team.Vehicles also don't seem to be touched at all, another disappointment considering the amazing potential they can have. The vehicle pad screams for more attention. Of the three (yes, only three - that doesn't even fill the list space!) vehicles you can purchase during a match, two are bland, expected additions that most games in this genre will have. The Grav Cycle is the best of the three, but still pales compared to other vehicles seen in FPS games in the past decade.I find myself picking it up every so often because despite its issues I really do want to enjoy this game. As you perfect your skiing and get better at predicting shots, there is some degree of redemption afforded the game? Those one-in-a-million shots are extremely gratifying, and high-speed chases are thrilling. Unfortunately, for a game so young, it seems to be suffering from the same fate many significantly older games are: a dwindling player base and no new official content. While Tribes fans may be able to look past the flaws to play a game bearing the series name with a modern paintjob, after a certain point the enjoyment of mid-air spinfusor directs simply can't produce enough draw to boot the game again. Whether that's after 5, 50, or 500 hours is dependent on how much you like the franchise.Sadly, Tribes: Ascend is only really recommendable to the intensely curious who won't mind the grinding and frustration or the long-time fans who'll buy the GOTY version. For a game with so much potential, it really feels the weight of its awards have crushed it. It's had its 15 minutes of fame and has ceased being profitable for the developer. Without a support team to keep it patched, hacker free, and fresh with new content, Tribes: Ascend is simply crumbling under its own weight.I love this game but it hates me. The Tribes franchise deserved better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not worth the time. I played since early beta and this game has always been underwhelming to the genre and an insult to the franchise. Bland combat, too many automatic weapons, small bland maps, AoE orbital super attacks, vehicles require ingame credits, blatant OP weapons, ignored broken mechanics, out of place ""class"" system., and now complete developer abandonment.They didn't have to copy Tribes 2 word for word, but they probably shouldn't have built it with nothing but broader appeal, and over simplification. This game failed for the same reasons Tribes: vengeance failed. The developer completely forgot what made Tribes 1 and 2 popular. Instead they tried to steal scraps from the tables of other games.

												This game has extreme potential. But as it stands right now, I recommend you to NOT play. Free or not it's SERIOUSLY rage inducing. I want to punch everyone I've met in this game, in the face. Hard. Not just a love tap that begs questions, I want to hospitalize them all. Somewhat like MW2 in that EVERYONE uses explosives, which are overpowered, easy to use, and actually are starter weapons. Don't play it unless you feel like buying a new monitor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awesome! I turned all the graphics to minimal for my misrable computer and it still looked pretty good. It runs very well and blends high-flying fun in the wilderzone with intense firefights and duels inside the generator room and surrounding corridors.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most awesome FPS games to come out in a long time. It has Jetpacks, that should be enough to convince you for starters, but if it's not, then it's also one of the only games where almost none of the wepons are hitscan, everything fires actual projectiles, even SMG's, so you have to lead and predict targets adding a much needed boost to skill ceiling and satisfaction on success that FPS games have been lacking lately. Nothing beats the feeling of landing that long range mid-air spinfusor shot. You can also get a bit of a boost to unlocking stuff by liking tribes on facebook and signing up for the game using a refferal link like https://account.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥=1322159&utm_campaign=email to get you some bonus XP at level 6 (and me too). The game has enough depth that I would reccomend making use of the skiing tutorial and target practice in game. Come play so I have fools to shoot!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												AMAZING! First multiplayer game that I've found my mouse cursor hovering over on a contstant basis rather than the single player epics that I usually go for! Do not let outside impressions fool you into thinking it's a hard game to get into, Tribes: Ascend is the embodiment of a game that is ""easy to learn but hard to master"" and the first genuine triumph in the free-to-play space...!

												Me and Tribes have a love-hate relationship I loved this game when it came out but now... The people who buy weapons and other stuff with real world money have a clear advantage over the low level guys who only have the default weapons. I also don't like the matchmaking system... up untill level 7 you can still play against low level guys like you, but when you reach level 8 you play against all of the other players that are really skilled and know the maps really well.If you don't like pay to win games don't download this game, but if you can live with all of the pay 2 win players you will really enjoy this great game. P.S. I played Tribes mostly from their website and only a little bit on steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A free to play, play to win game.I use to play Tribes back when it first came out around 2000. It had awesome gameplay, and a ton of mods that kept you interested. There was no leveling up, everyone had access to the same classes, weapons, and accessories. You played to win, and the community was amazing. The game had it's own in-system IRC chat, where you could get help, have fun, or even get recruited into a tribe (clan). They had rankings for the best tribe for each mod, which were determined by scheduled matches. Tribes was my first online gaming love. Unfortunately I don't think I will ever find that level of awesomeness again. Franchise has just seemed to go down hill since the original. This latest installment makes me sad. If you want to play on a versatile and competative level, like the original offered, you either have to spend money, or grind days, probably even weeks, worth of gameplay to get enough exp to achieve it. Also, the support for the game appears to have totally vanished.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now, Im about to receive a lot of hate. You have like 5 minutes of game time! You didn't play the old games!Yes, I did.I have little game time because I played on an other account that was hacked and I lost the password. I did play the old games which is why Im complaining.Issue 1You need a stupid good video card to work this game. Sure, in the trailers it looks cool, but I set all my video to MINIMAL and still lagged off the game. Yikes.Issue 2Gameplay. This game is Planetside 2, slower. You have to play for HOURS to be anywhere NEAR killing anyone. I got my 5 kills (3 of which were assists) by finishing off people. That's it. Its ridiculous to aim, only good weapons are explosive.Issue 3Price. This is TF2. A P2W. No joke. If you cant shell out a 2.50 then you are dead meat. Like I said, in Issue 2, everyone s overpowered. And, we cant forget the GOTY Edition is 40 bucks. That's deadlocked. I've never seen a sale.Overall, its BAD. Sure, you have a jetpack...that lasts fro 15 seconds. The skiing is just gliding down a hill. Its not fun. In the little time I played, I got one weapon. One. The cheapest weapon. I had to play 3 rounds for one measly secondary weapon.Its not fun. Its not good. I recommend other games, like TF2 and Planetside 2. Though TF2 is P2W, the F2P experience is fun too. Planetside 2 is a sped up, better looking version of this game.There. I'm done. Im expecting hate, a lot of hate. But like I said, I DID PLAY THE OLD GAMES.And out of 10? I say 2/10. Only because I got a weapon and its a revival of Tribes. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It seems they put a lot of effort to jumpstart the Tribes series again,which was long dead and a favorite of mine some 15 years ago(Tribes Vengeance and Mechwarrior: Vengeance, two games I loved dearlywhich received a reboot and got me to download Steam in the first place..then ended up being f2p fodder.)To be fair I never bought the game and did the f2p route, which i'm guessingis what a majority ended up doing.. shame, because I believe this is what killed itand hence why the developers (likely fans of the original Tribes game) nuked itas to them the public had no interest in showing support.As for a review I can't offer much because I was only ten minutes into playing onlinewhen I decided to remove it from my system, it was incredibly laggy and not the gameI used to love.
