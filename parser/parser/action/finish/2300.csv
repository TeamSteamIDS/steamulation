												This is the best game ever. I could play this forever with all the mods/WADs that the fanbase has made. And while it doesn't have the biggest community, there's one, and it's still active to this day. This game is pure fun, I recommend this game to anyone, anywhere, anytime.

												20 hours, 30 levels, an entire case of Boy Scout popcorn, and countess retries...Okay i think i can reccomend this now.YESYESYESYESYESYESYESBUYITBUYITBUYITBUYITthere is no other way for me to put it.  This game is AMAZING and i honestly loved EVERY SECOND of it from the start to the end, even with all the glitches and overly complicated levels.  No, the first thing you're thinking is: ""Are the graphics still acceptable?""  No, they are dated and old, but after the first few levels and bosses you really come to realize how well they fit the secenry of everything and granted, if they were in 3d, they just wouldn't be the same.  Thats not to say that they arent realistic enough to enjoy though.  Every one of the monsters and weapons look unique, save for the shotgun maybe, but they don't get boring or hard to look at after a long time.While many may think of this an only an expansion for Doom, the biggest problem with Doom was that it left you wanting more, no matter how many monsters you destroyed in ever changing ways, you still wanted more.  By the end of Doom 2, i was so sick (in a good way) of seeing rooms full of imps that i'm holding an air shotgun when opening doors in my own house now.The biggest problem(s) for someone who wants to buy this game is going to be:A: Is it worth my money?  A $5 dollar game takes a good chunk out of a $20 steam card.  But not only do you get the main game, you get and expansion pack, the doom2.wad file that allows you to play online using ZDoom or any other services, AND if you own Garry's Mod, you can use the full GM-Doom port (this alone is pretty fun).B: Does it play nice with Windows Xp, Vista, 7, or 8 computers?  Like most early Pc games on Steam, a dosbox code is included to run the game with no fuss in coding anything.  Though as I said before, you get the Doom2.wad file, (witch is the heart of the game) and that can be copy-pasted into ANY doom emulator.  Find one you like and its smooth sailing from there.C: Is the Difficulty too high/too low compared to today?  If its a mid 90's game, it's going to be hard.  Most of the challenge though is spent not so much in the fighting but in the surviving.  You CAN clear a room of 20 monsters with one quick rocket but is that rocket going to explode in your face? or is it going to aleart other enemies?  Your Choice.So as i said,BUYITBUYITBUYITBUYIT its the best game in the series (Doom and Wolfenstien) and is 100% worth your time.			",84,7,0,6,4,1,3

												Behold the glory that is Doom 2.The end all, be all of first person shooters.Let's be honest, this can be reviewed in one word: Perfection.This game has all you will ever need:- A BAD-A$$ selection of Weapons.- Legions of Monsters, Demons, and Zombies to slay.- Mazes, Secrets, and Rewards o' plenty.A game that has yet to be surpassed in over 20 years.If Steam vanished tomorrow and I only had one game to play for the rest of my life, this would be it.DO NOT play this using DOSBOX.There are several emulators that run Doom 2 perfectly.They add many new features that weren't available in 1994 like high resolutions!I personally use Zdoom and fully recommend it.Go to Zdoom.org and grab this legendary title!

												Doom 2 is a touching tale of a space soldier and his super shotgun trying to get by in a city run by hell demons. The plot touches upon interesting subjects, such as what the human race would do if it got invaded by hell demons, and what John Doom would do if he got a double-barreled shotgun.The level design is fantastic, as it helps the player see from John Doom's point of view, to the point of sharing his frustration at discovering he was supposed to shoot that wall on the right to open the door.

												Doom II , released in 1994 . Uses 2d sprites , midi soundtracks ; technologically outdated today .Yet , it's still one of the most entertaining FPS ever made . Few other games give you the feeling of being a badass killing the forces of hell in another planet with double-barreled shotgun like this . The bgm was pure gold - actually , it still is , despite being old . Those midis fit more than any so-called music in those modern pseudo-FPSs where you just have to hide and kill those evil ruskies .♥♥♥♥ the Navy , the seals and everything like that : you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ space marine with a BFG facing satan himself . That's how a FPS should be !			",149,4,8,14,8,0,4

												My first ever memory of being grounded, came from this game.Back when I was just a little girl, my family got our first computer through my father's job. Every evening around my bedtime, my dad would retire to ""work"" on it in his office, and I was told by my mom not to disturb him. Overcome with curiosity, I snuck out of bed one night to go and see what kind of work he was doing, only to find him playing this game instead. I was afraid he would scold me, but instead, he lifted me up on his lap, set me in front of the keyboard and said ""Lass, the world needs us. Let's save it""It became our regular thing. I would sneak out of bed without mom knowing and sit up with dad while we played Doom II until it was time for dad to go to bed. At first I just watched him, then he started to teach me what he was doing as he played. Not many days later, I got to try it for myself, and under his wing, I managed to complete the game with some assistance. It was such a thrill for me as just a little child, and I had so much fun doing it.Eventually my mom caught us; my dad, who was supposed to complete his reports for his work, was instead playing a game filled with horrible monsters and gore with his young daughter, and me; a 7 year old girl up at 11 in the evening on a school night. She was not happy. I got grounded and I didn't see her talk to dad at all for at least a week. Still, it is one of my favorite memories from growing up. 20 years later, I still return to this game, again and again. While a bit outdated graphically, Doom II is still nothing but a pleasure after all these years, and I can do nothing but recommend it. My now 55 year old dad also still play it, and has nothing but positive things to say about it. Mom still doesn't recommend it.10/10, would get grounded again			",55,10,0,13,14,0,7

												The pinnacle of the shoot 'em up genre, you really cannot go wrong here.Every level is memorable to at least SOME degree, with the slow introduction of enemies and weaponry balance forcing the player to adapt to the difficulty or die.If you consider yourself a fan of first person shooters with a bend towards mechanically driven basis as opposed to a storyline one, this is a must.

												DOOM II: A timeless classic first person shooter, sequel to the genre's most relevant progenitor, DOOM.DOOM II takes everything that the first DOOM was and simply makes it more terrifying and elevates the level designs to staggering scales.At first glance DOOM II may appear to be the same game as the first (same engine, same interface, same graphical style, ect) and in many respects, one could argue that it is. There are some distinct differences though. Allow me to demonstrate: If you go thru a level and come across some secrets filled with ammo, a new gun, or some health and armor and you manage to murder everything in your path to the level's end, you are probably playing the first DOOM. However, if you are rummaging through a level and stumble upon some supposed ""secret areas"" that seem to offer substantial offerings but then quickly you realize, ""oh wait, no, now there are monsters completely surrounding me and my surroundings have suddenly transformed into what seems like hell itself with absolutely no escape."" Following your savage death, or your desperate and hurried arrival to the level's end, you should know that you are playing DOOM II.DOOM II throws in a nice variety of additional enemies with some very unique and deadly abilities. The combination of these new oppositions in conjunction with the even more greatly thought out and twisted level-design ensure that DOOM II is bo no stretch a walk in the park once you have gone through the first portion of the game. This game is challenging (assuming you are on standard or higher difficulty) terrifying, exilherating, mindless in story conception, albiet mindfull gamers will surely benefit with this game because with the staggering odds that are pitted against you (the Space Marine) a sharp mind and hair trigger reactions and neccesary to conquer and to survive through this game's perilous campaign.Easily one of my favorite games of all time as a game mechanic and skill oriented player. This game holds up to this day and is also highly moddable since there has been such an everlasting community around this game and creating additional content and tweaks for it.I could not recomend this game higher if you are one gamer such as myself.

												Doom 2, part of the series of 90s doom games serving as the legacy to the First Person Shooter. Although other examples existed, nothing was as action packed as this one and nothing was as fun.Honestly, if you haven't played this game already, then I say ""What are you waiting for???"" Seriously, I don't care how old or young you are. If you're old enough to know right from wrong, violent is bad and all that, and love action games this game is SERIOUSLY the best bit of money you can spend. This game has aged fantastically, and the modding community keeps it alive to this day! This is a port of the old DOS version, but you can go out there and get open source ports to complement this that will seriously improve the texture quality like ZDoom. When you do that then you open yourself to a whole new world of graphics and gameplay.Try the original game as it is, the amount of slaughtering you do will be a blast, But once you're done get out there and download some mods baby!The two I recommend is ""MegaMan 8-Bit deathmatch"", in which you can play as Megaman or many different robot masters in deathmatch games, and Brutal Doom, a popular mod which ups the gore and detail factor in the game ads alot of extra gestures and taunts, improves the quality and design of weapons, and adds extra things like a iron signts and a boot to the head and a rip apart option. This is definitely the way to play the game all the way through!For more details on Brutal Doom see my video on Brutal Doom v20 titled ""Boot to the head!""

												Do you like demons?  No?  Good, cause this game is about killing demons.  How many demons you ask?  All of them.  You kill demons, you shoot demons, you punch demons, you melt demons, you blow up demons,  Matt Demon, you sprint around demons.  The first game was about killing demons.  You know what this game is about?  Killing more demons.  Want the story?  Here's the story:  There are demons and you kill them, end of story.  Why kill demons?  They're demons.  In all seriousness, this entire game is about a secret complex government initiative to wipe out the poor using genetically engineered monstrosities and bring the literal armageddon so they can rebuild the world in their twisted image.  The leader behind this all is Bob George, the 53rd President of Congress Union and the second leader of Communism.  You are freedom fighter here to... I'm kidding, you kill demons and demons want to kill you.  Sure there are open ended maps, exploration, various items, and secret areas you find by humping walls, but just ask yourself one simple question:  how many demons do I want to kill.

												!!Important note!! If you want to have the best experience with doom 2, I highly recommend you play this game with a launcher called Zdoom which is free, which provides loads of customization to the controls and makes doom playable on windows 10 and 8.There are some useful videos on Youtube that will explain to you how to setup and use zdoom. There is a link below to zdoom and there is also a link below to brutal doom.       What I like about the game•	The secret levels in doom 2 are really cool.•	They have added new monsters to the game, like the commando and the Arch-vile. •	The double barrel shotgun is an awesome weapon to use. •	You can mod the game, I highly recommend you try brutal doom or project brutality. •	Plenty of secrets to find throughout the game. •	Nothing has changed, for the worse, you are still fighting loads of demons at a 100mph •	The levels in the game are awesome.What I disliked or was disappointed with •	Only one new weapon.•	Sometimes frustrating, because some of the levels are really hard and if you don’t save you will have to start the level all over again.•  I was disappointed with the final boss.  My Conclusion A very good sequel, not as good as the first one, but I still highly recommend it. I also highly recommend you play this game with brutal doom or project brutality.  75/100zdoom http://zdoom.org/DownloadBrutal doomhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom ",106,1,0,3,1,0,0

												This is my favourite FPS of all time next to Heretic - Shadow of The Serpent Riders, DooM 2 is a multi-layered FPS game which is the purest example of how the genre should be, fast paced, challenging and meticulously well designed. The levels in DooM 2 are absolute masterpieces, each their own puzzle and often require good navigational skills as some are extremely elaborate and focus on non-linearity and good resource management. As like the original DooM, the visuals in this are a work of art, each and every texture feels in place, the concept couldn't get much better, the atmosphere is evil and consistent and the architecture is flawless. DooM 2's gameplay is incredibly fast-paced and requires you to maneuver skillfully through hordes of monsters and causing 'in-fighting' between monsters to conserve ammunition. Each and every slight detail of design this game has was put into consideration; monster placement, switches, the way you progress, keys scattered around the map, secrets, traps, FPS has only come downhill from here, regardless of all the flashy cutscenes and graphics presented in todays games this offers a far deeper experience than pretty much every FPS to date.DooM 2 is the definitive FPS experience showing how great gameplay and level design work hand in hand with each other and how important that combination is in creating a flawless masterpiece, this is one game I complete atleast 3 times a year from start to finish and have more fun in it with each playthrough, I recommend you play this on Ultra-Violence as that is the way its meant to be played and without saving throughout the levels as that takes away a lot of the challenege.♥♥♥♥ you.

												Doom 2 is the second game of the franchise coming out only a year after the original was released. It is set right after the events that took place in Episode 3 of the first game where you have managed to return to Earth only to discover that it has come under attack by the forces of hell. It doesn't take long to find out why humanity is on the verge of extinction as the amount of monsters you see on Earth is more than you even see exploring hell in the first game. To make matters worse they have sent brand new demons such as the Archvile, chain-gun wielding zombies and other demons far more powerful than those you spent the majority of the time fighting in Doom 1. This is definitely a sequel made for those with lots of experience playing the original and will hold no punches back. It is a far more difficult game than the original, as such I would suggest starting with that one if you are looking to get in to the series. If you simply want to play some of the insane number of mods available then this is the one to get since must mods are for Doom 2.The only new gun in your arsenal will be a double barreled shotgun and packs a heck of a punch to anyone in its path but lacks the great range of the single barreled shotgun making both viable options instead of a straight upgrade. One of the first things you may notice is that there are no longer any Episodes to choose from. Instead you start from level 1 and make your way to the end of the game from there. It sucks not being able to start at the middle or the end of the game anymore though I did find this change to be for the better overall as you no longer end an episode and have to collect all your weapons over again when you start the next one. You may be thinking that has the potential to make the game too easy as you can now stock up on tons of ammo but that is not the case. Due to the powerful new enemies and the sheer amount of numbers they throw at you, ammo feels more valuable than ever. In the original game you would tend to stick to the shotgun the majority of the time to save ammo for Cyberdemons but in Doom 2 that will more likely than not get you killed as it is very difficult to handle the new monsters with a shotgun alone.While the Cyberdemon is still the most powerful enemy you will face I somehow fear the Archvile just as much or even more. It is quite a nasty monster that will set you on fire if it can see you requiring you to hide behind any objects or walls to break its line of sight. All the while it resurrects previously defeated enemies making your situation far more dire every moment that it remains alive. Those are the kind of moments you will more likely than not swap out your trusty shotgun and use up much rarer ammo types in the hopes that you won't need it later. The level design in this is downright sadistic and will lock you into small rooms full of enemies, descend the floor beneath you to fall face to face with an enemy or place enemies in hard to reach vantage points as they suddenly pelt you from above. Levels are much larger this time around and there is a big focus on verticality. The verticality can be very annoying as you cannot look up to shoot at them unless you are playing Doom 2 via a source port that gives you mouse aiming. Even then it is quite a rush as you are surrounded on from all sides and are even being shot at from above lending the game the feel that you are really fighting for your survival.In Doom 1 more often than not you felt like you were a badass but in Doom 2 you really get the feeling that you are just surviving as the slightest mistake can be the end of you. Many of the times you will not see the fight coming as the walls drop around you to reveal that you are indeed surrounded in a room that appeared safe. It is a lot more action oriented than the original that had the sounds and groans of the enemy far before you see it to give it a bit of a horror feel. In this it is a lot more in your face merely dropping enemies without much indication. Whichever you enjoy more is up to preference though in some occasions Doom 2 does end up feeling down right cheap. One other thing I am not too crazy about is the obscurely hidden keycards for a few levels. I usually ended up finding them while searching for secrets only to discover that is actually the right way to go. I can see many players being completely stuck in some levels and ending up searching for a walkthrough. Thankfully most of the levels do not have obscure level design and flow rather well with you knowing where to go at all times.All of the items make a return like the hazmat suit, night vision and soul spheres with no new additions. Secrets are still plentiful and more important than ever as finding a crate of rare ammo can be the difference between life or death down the road. If you die you start at the beginning of the level with only a pistol like in the original Doom. Environments were very impressive for their time featuring giant cities with skyscrapers and tons of things on screen. I still find it rather cool even today as everything you see will eventually be explored and is not just set dressing. Being able to fight in a large nonlinear city, shooting rockets while running faster than Sonic the Hedgehog is a lost art in modern FPS games sadly. Music is strangely enough no longer guitar shredding Metal and is instead a more laid back Industrial Techno sounding type of genre. It is strange as Doom 2 is a lot more action packed than the original and yet is the one with music that doesn't get you pumped. It has some really good tracks nonetheless and is really just up to personal preference. Controls have been modernized and has movement set to “WASD” with the mouse controls allowing you to look left and right. Pushing the mouse forward causes your character to walk forward which is annoying and cannot be disabled without the use of a mod.Your main mission is to help the remnants of humanity off the planet before being completely wiped out. Eventually you succeed in your mission and lay down your gun, sit back and wait for death while proud of the fact that you saved humanity. You get a call telling you that they found where the demons are pouring in from and you wearily stand back up to continue the fight. It sounds a lot better than it is to be honest. Story is minimal and you only get a bit of text from time to time. Like pretty much any other shooter at the time it is all about gameplay and it is still as fun now as it was back then. It is the same timeless gameplay from Doom 1 but with the addition of plenty of new powerful demons and much harder levels. If you liked Doom this is really more of the same only bigger, badder and more likely to make you John Romero's b****. At the low price it is now being sold at it is more than worth it to take a trip back to memory lane or to any fan of fast and frantic FPS action that's willing to look past the dated graphics. So rev up your chainguns and mow down demons until you are knee deep in the dead.			",1881,553,61,204,168,17,226

												The fastest shooter game ever, Doom is a timeless classic that I have played on and off for more than 15 years. It's easily my favorite and most played game of all time. On my hard drive I have hand-picked community-made levels, textures and mods and together they are about 130 times the size of the base game. This is literally enough content to keep you playing for years. Talk about free DLC, especially considering most of the community maps are of a higher visual standard than the originals! God bless the Two Johns and the most wonderful fruit of their labor!Now with 100% more Steam Awards 2016 nominations for the ""Test of Time"" award!			",546,285,26,69,45,4,63

												You pay for what you get; DOOM II, one of the best shooters of all time. You can do whatever you want with the game's WAD; I reccomend replacing the DOSbox launcher with something more modern such as zdoom (this is fairly simple to do). This allows for a more enhanced playing experience. Launch options aside, DOOM II is still a pretty solid game to this day, offering tons of action and excitement.			",103,19,2,8,5,0,3

												I'm only 15, soon to be 16, and I've heard for many years from people who played this upon its initial release that this remains one of the best games ever made to this day, even after 22 years. Now that I've finally got my hands on it, I honestly can't disagree. I'm sick and tired of modern FPS games that hold your hand, so DOOM 2 just gives you a bunch of demons and a super shotgun and says ""kill 'em"". No boring unskippable cutscenes, no quick time events, no guidance on how to reach the exit, just killing demons to your heart's content. Therefore, as someone who has only just now experienced this classic, I can confidently say this is one of the best games ever made, no nostalgia required. Picked it up for £3 on sale, would happily pay 10x as much for it.Tl;dr 10/10 would shoot demon raspberries again			",103,11,2,4,9,0,7

												Buy it. If you are thinking about it, buy it. Don't use any fancy renderers which add mouselook, jumping, crouching or many things which ruin the original game design, just use https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom (brings it as close to the original renderer and returns a few effects which later sourceports removed, like the game's naturally spooky darkness effect) and disable Y-Axis mouselook in options. There, now you are ready to play a game which really has not aged a day. It is still visceral as hell, still satisfying, still difficult, addictive and challenging to the core and now you can play this game as it was intended. The mouselook, crouch, jumping and cleaner advanced renders all make the game feel older. Yes, a few levels out of 30+ suck, but you get the double barrel shotgun. Every major part of this game holds up, the abstract and sinister level design, the weapons where every weapon has a use (even the pistol can be used as a low-ammo flashlight in dark areas), every single enemy is uniquely balanced with the weapons and level design to have strengths and weaknesses that you have to exploit, the sound design which feels visceral as hell and lets you get hints at enemies lurking around the corner or behind walls... the list just goes on in how many ways the game has held up.Without being able to look up it is still more complex than most shooters today, with a very specific vibe where you get REALLY into it if you keep playing. You feel every shot, and it's pretty much the perfect game to feel good.You aren't a man if you can't kick♥♥♥♥♥in Doom 2. My steam time says 0.2 hours, but that is because I have been running Chocolate Doom and have easily racked up 40+ hours in it so far, staying up late every once and a while just so I can push back hell even harder.

												The game that encouraged me to pursue a career in computer graphics and software engineering.At the beginning of the 90s John Carmack and John Romero made a press-release to inform the public of the greatest game ever made. It would be a 3D world with rooms at different altitudes, the most complex lighting in any game to date, filled with hundreds of enemies and running at a blazing fast speed. A small team of guys pulled this off and revolutionized the games industry forever. Where most entertainment is subjective in quality, DooM represented a solved problem: it is so tight in its design that you can not improve it by adding or removing anything.Except these guys improved on the original base game with DooM 2. A ton of new enemies, the super shotty, and another 32 levels of incredile variety - from ""Gotcha"" to ""Barrels o' Fun"" DooM 2 is still engaging today in a way that most modern FPS can't hope to achieve.If you are in the mood to shoot some bad guys, and you don't want any of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that comes with modern game design (regen health, aim down sight, cutscenes, hints, etc) DooM 2 is the cure for the itch. About 10 seconds from executable to shooting an imp in the face, DooM 2 respects your time while offering a surprising level of challenge on the hardest difficulties.Buying this game grants you the game files and a dosbox executable to immediately start playing without any fuss. However, you can drop that DOOM2.WAD into one of hundreds of free source ports (doomsday, chocolate doom, zdoom, etc etc) to play with modernized graphics and online multiplayer. Further, you can download one of the thousands of mods (yes, including Brutal DooM) and level packs that people are still developing to this day.""Check this box if you received this product for free"". I have probably bought this game about 10 times since the original set of floppy disks. It comes in so many bundles, has been ported to so many consoles, and is wrapped with games like DooM 3 BFG. I can safely say I will be playing DooM 2 for the rest of my life.			",411,64,7,35,35,4,57

												After the success of DOOM, id Software decided to develop a sequel, which is pretty much the same as the first game, but with a few new enemies, which, unlike the original demons, require a little more strategy and attention from the player's part. The Super Shotgun was also introduced.The main difference between DOOM and DOOM II is the level design. John Romero, DOOM's main level designer, didn't work too much on DOOM II, and as a consequence the levels are really different. They aren't better or worse, it all depends on what you think.And finally the soundtrack. Instead of being a fast paced metal thing, it's more... atmospheric let's say. Again, if it's better or worse depends on the person.Personally, I like more the first game, gameplay and soundtrack wise, but I can't say that this isn't a really good game.			",48,0,0,1,1,0,0

												Doom II is the sequel to Doom obviously, and that being said, you should know what to expect.Unlike Doom which follows an episodic formula, Doom II has 32 streamlined levels packed into one demon blasting adventure.Level Design is more complex in Doom II, and boasts large outdoor maps. Doom II also introduces the Super Shotgun (A Double Barrel Shoutgun that shoots 14 pellets instead of 7) and some new monsters, such as the Pain Elemental, which shoots Lost Souls at you, and the Revenant, which shoots player homing missles.Plenty of gamers still play Doom and Doom II online and theres hoards of custom wads for it out there, so theres a lot on your plate in terms of content.Doom II is as much a masterpiece as Doom is, and continues the amazing expeirence that set the world ablaze.

												Doom was a series that blew me away when I was younger. I was born right before the advent of 3D gaming, so I grew up with the progression from 16-bit to 32-bit and then full on polygonal games. It felt like technology was moving so fast and that I was at the cusp of creativity.Even though Super Mario 64 had changed how I viewed gaming, Doom came into my life and changed what I thought of my PC. I now wanted to master the keyboard and mouse so that I could become a Doom god. I eventually got my own PC and Doom became my best friend.What I found was, I had a stronger fondness for Doom II. I couldn't explain it then, but I felt like the game was more intense. It seemed to move faster, had bigger levels and a greater variety of enemies. Even if it bared resemblance to the original Doom, it felt like a totally different game.I can now explain why I felt such a way. ID Software were always looking to outdo themselves. All of the creators had become masters of their own game, so they looked on how to up the challenge. Throwing simply more enemies would be cheap, but it also could work with some slight modifications to the gunplay.This brought about the Super Shotgun (or Double Barrell), which has such a significant impact on combat scenarios and level design. Since you basically have a gun that is close range with the damage of a rocket launcher (and no splash damage), you can destroy lesser foes in a single shot.It turns some of the drawn out encounters from the first game into lightning fast executions. You can clear out rooms of weaklings in mere seconds, where the original Doom required you to carefully plan out whom to attack first. That does still factor into Doom II, what with the enemies retaining their simplistic designs and the new enemies being super deadly; the change is now that there are dramatically more enemies.The levels are much larger than anything from the first game, so you will encounter hundreds of foes in single levels. Your  arsenal will grow over the course of the game and you'll eventually find yourself with a large amount of ammunition. If nothing was done to even the odds, you'd be overpowered within 5 levels.While not every map is a masterpiece, the majority of this game has more in-depth designs. Vertical spacing is delved into; differing level heights play a bigger role; there are even some gimmick levels that throw large bosses at you with a small puzzle to kill them. It's definitely not just bigger = better.The game also does away with Episode selection and has you play all 30 levels back to back. If you get good at the game, you end up never losing your inventory. Most of the levels have ammo backpacks, so even if you do die, you're never left underpowered. You may run out of ammo, though.The newer enemies help flesh out the roster a bit. The original game nearly blows it's entire line-up in the first Episode, saving the really big bosses for the later levels. Doom II introduces one weaker version of a previous enemy (the Hell Knight) and some real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ priority targets.The Mancubus is basically a walking tank with double rocket launchers; the Pain Elemental acts as a mobile spawning point; the Revenant is hyper fast and strong (though with low health); finally, the Chaingun Guy has impeccable accuracy and speed with his chaingun. It introduces a more steady difficulty curve that doesn't need to reset at the start of every 8 or so levels (like how the original Doom handled it).The Steam version of Doom II is also limited to being a DOSBox emulation (much like it's predecessor), so that does suck. With the aid of a source port, you can also get some co-op going. You can even clean up the visuals a bit and add some more modernized controls.Overall, Doom II may not be as brilliantly made as the first game. I still enjoy the combat and larger levels more, but there is a sense that ID Software got a bit too ambitious. Regardless of that, there is no reason to pass up on playing this.9/10			",388,51,7,30,13,4,36

One mod makes this 100x better, and gorier: Brutal Doom, Best mod ever. It is a MUST!			",144,16,0,12,14,2,9

												The game alongside its previous iteration that pioneered the modern PC gaming modding scene. The community is still crazy active and the modding scene still creates amazing mods to play to this day. DON'T PLAY IT ON VANILLA DOSBOX, GET YOURSELF A SOURCE PORT LIKE GZDOOM OR ZDOOMIf you want to know how to use these source ports for things like playing vanilla Doom and Doom ll or playing community made mods/wads I made a minute long tutorial if you are interested. It's got ""some"" humor in it, let's just leave it at that... Enjoy!

												(Ignore my time on record, I've done my hundreds of hours of DOOMin' in sourceports outside of Steam)DOOM 2 is a game. It is THE game. It is a berserker-packin' game and a half! I can't say wether I prefer DOOM 2's vanilla content over DOOM 1 or the official expansions, but if you want to take advantage of all the weapons/items/enemies classic DOOM has to offer, engine/gameplay that lends itself to good level design that'll make you smile, and over 20 years of mods and WAD's, giving you a game you can play for the rest of your life, you're gonna want DOOM 2 (or at least its files when loading up your sourceport of choice).

												Honestly, I don't even know where to start with this....How about this, the very first tattoo I ever got was a half sleeve based on artwork from this game. If that doesn't tell you how much I like it, and how awesome it is.. I don't know what else can.Every single thing in this game is exactly as I remember. The music is still amazing even today, the game is still stupidly difficult if you want it to be.The Hordes have come, and you must save Earth's population and destory the infestation, one demon at a time.The addition of the Brutal Doom mod will definitely make the game better for more modern players who like to have more aiming control.Get this. Seriously. It is worth WAY more than the 5 bucks it costs on here. Not to mention for 15 you get the first one and the master levels.I've probably played through DOOM II more than any other game. I'll probably keep playing this until I am well into my 50's.			",84,7,0,15,2,1,11

												DOOM II is a worthy sequel to a classic FPS, which I've already written about if you somehow didn't know about it. This gives you 32 generally great new levels, a new weapon (the Super Shotgun - a double-barreled shotgun), and adds a number of new monsters that serve to elevate the gameplay even further.And...that's it. It's honestly more of an expansion than a sequel. But trust me when I say that the game is all the more better for it, because pretty much every addition is an improvement. Doom fans view this as the pinnacle of classic Doom, and custom level designers have generally used it in lieu of the first game since it came out. Not that the first game is bad; with the lack of Doom II's new features it becomes an experience all its own. But if you get the first one, you'd do extremely well to grab its sequel as well.Just don't play it with the included DOSBox emulator. What you're paying for is DOOM2.WAD - the game file itself. If you want a high quality experience, download Chocolate Doom if you want the closest thing to pure Doom, ZDoom if you want to easily play custom levels and mods, or Skulltag if you want to try multiplayer. Given how many of the aforementioned mods and custom levels there are, how many are still being made to this day, and how many good ones there are of varying types and stripes, you'd better believe it when I say it's worth it.

												The sequel to the game that started it all. The combat and movement is fast and fluid. The level design is outstanding. The background music fits the scene perfectly as you zip through corridors and blast away demons with the double-barreled super shotgun. Graphically it's aged well. Hard to believe that this game is already over 20 years old. John Carmack's DOOM engine was well ahead of its time.			",76,13,0,5,18,0,13

												Screw this modern games this♥♥♥♥♥♥right here is classic and work of art. If you want to read my opinion about new "" Doom"" it's on bottom.I really suggest you to buy this , one of the very first FPS games to come out. If you enjoyed first Doom then surely you will enjoy Doom 2. Every single has played Doom in their lives , if the haven't they need to fix their lives. Doom is my childhood a game where i enjoyed killing people as a kid. Propaply a reason why I wnt to shrink a couple of times.Sadly this game won't run my new PC i see many people have problems with that. Well can't blame the since game is over 20 years old.If you hate this game , not even doctors could help or even save you. You are just a lost cause. You have to re-ask yourself a meaning of your life.My opinion about new "" Doom ""This is some Halo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t right here just with "" doom "" demons. They should have just remastered Doom 3 basiclly or even better good old original Doom. This just dosen't feel like Doom anymore and not to mention that our legendary Doomguy now looks like Masterchief a bit , maybe too much. Just dont buy this rather save up your money and buy original dooms which are cheaper and 100x times better then this.I have been fan of Doom for a very VERY long time and i find this insulting Doom franchise . they basiclly ruined Doom with this is what im trying to say and to me this will never be Doom.The only people who will find this "" awesome 100 times better then original Doom "" and stuff like that are either trolls . not Doom fans or just 12 year old kids who never even seen original Doom.

												Honestly, this is one of the best games out there. The maps are so well made, there's lots of gore and screams. The guys at id software really put in work making this piece of art. I can't imagine my life without Doom, it's literally impossible. Doom II just takes everything to the next level, for example the SSG is ♥♥♥♥ing GODLIKE. It even has a strong, never ending community. The community is even better than games like Call of Duty (which is dying, btw.) One of the reasons for this is that the, well, game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. And that the makers of this game makes it possible for their fans to modify the game, make their own leves and so own - how many other game developers have done that? Not many, at least.The movement feels very sleek and perfect, even when using mouse. There aren't much options in the settings, but the important ones like mouse and screen are there.The secrets are so entertaining to find, and there's just that kind of feeling finding those - as well as chopping demons in half.If you haven't tried out this game, you really should. You won't be dissapointed.			",9,1,0,1,0,0,0

												What are you doing reading this review instead of buying the game? This is one of the best games of all time!Doom 2 is one of the best games ever made. Featuring many source ports that you can choose for your liking, to make the game run well for our modern needs. I personally would recommend GZDoom if you want to play Doom with Mods, Zanondronum/Doomseeker and/or Zdaemon for multiplayer and use ZDL as a mod loader, so you can pick what mods you want to play and what source port you want to use.Doom/Doom 2 has the biggest and most active modding community in gaming, even to this day. If you're a fan of classic games and a fan of modding, then Doom/Doom 2 is a must have for you.Modders have even remade Donkey Kong Country and Sonic in the Doom engine. GET IT!

												Honestly, this is one of the best games out there. The maps are so well made, there's lots of gore and screams. The guys at id software really put in work making this piece of art. I can't imagine my life without Doom, it's literally impossible. Doom II just takes everything to the next level, for example the SSG is ♥♥♥♥ing GODLIKE. It even has a strong, never ending community. The community is even better than games like Call of Duty (which is dying, btw.) One of the reasons for this is that the, well, game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. And that the makers of this game makes it possible for their fans to modify the game, make their own leves and so own - how many other game developers have done that? Not many, at least.The movement feels very sleek and perfect, even when using mouse. There aren't much options in the settings, but the important ones like mouse and screen are there.The secrets are so entertaining to find, and there's just that kind of feeling finding those - as well as chopping demons in half.If you haven't tried out this game, you really should. You won't be dissapointed.			",9,1,0,1,0,0,0

												To people who think that the controls are horrid:... yeah, I'd be inclined to agree, if it weren't for the fact that you can actually change the controls. Also, there's sourceports for the DOOM engine, which come with new settings and the ability to run complex WADs like Brutal Doom or Russian Overkill.Also, did I mention this game's super addictive? That ain't even a bad thing, because this game is also super fun. You run fast, the action's fast-paced (especially when you run it with a sourceport like ZDoom, Zandronum or EDGE) and the weapons are hella satisfying to maim imps with. Nothing can match the satisfaction of killing a Cacodemon with the Super Shotgun, not even the Doom 4 of today from what I've seen. The normal Shotgun's also fun, being the more reliable option for ammo conservation over longer ranges against stronger opponents. The Plasma Rifle's one of the best weapons to deal with the tougher Demonfolk, like Cyberdemons or Hell's Knights-- among the Rocket Launcher and the BFG9000. The Pistol is the weapon you start out with, and it isn't bad if you don't have other weapons. Better than nothing, and that nothing being your fists.Also, did I mention the BFG9000's called the Big ♥♥♥♥in' Gun? If that isn't a selling point to you, I don't know what is.			",16,2,0,1,4,1,0

												If you liked DOOM, then you will like DOOM II. It is the same as the first game, but with a super shotgun, more and new enemies, and instead of 3 (or 4) episodes it is one long episode. This is a fun classic shooter. I would recommend DOOM II to anyone who liked DOOM, or are wanting a good classic.10/10My 1994 Game of the Year!			",51,2,0,2,1,0,1

												It's the father of all FPS games, the very king of the ""run and gun"" genre... IT'S DOOM!!! This game is amazing in so many ways you have no idea. The Doom community is still strong and has thousands of very talented mappers/modders. I must warn you though, buying this game and just start playing it is a very bad idea. This game came out in 1994, so it obviously plays♥♥♥♥♥♥on modern computers without a source-port. Go get ZDoom or Zandronum then you will be able to enjoy an enhanced Doom with and without mods. You can also easily get the Doom wads free from Abandonware, I just bought it on Steam to post this review AND to show I'm a Doom fan. It may look like I have no hours in this game, but I bet I have more hours in Doom than I have in all my steam games combined. I played this all the time as a kid, and I still play this all the time.			",96,4,1,4,6,0,8

												8/10 - Would HIGHLY recommend to everyone.Classic game. New amazing game that came out last year (DOOM, 2016) and made me want the play the classics. Simplistic but yet amazing feeling to killing enemies and finding those secrets in each level.Although, sadly no steam overlay, but yet you can't complain, as the game was made many years ago. Only other downside I could see, it feels like it wasnt ported over properly (and it might just be me) but moving the mouse forward/backwards will move the charecter (mean't to happen?)On the flip side, game only uses 8mb to download and has hours of exciting gameplay.

												Been playing DOOM 2 for 20+ years. Don't see myself getting bored with it anytime soon. A timeless classic with a near limitless ability to be modified and tweaked by a dedicated community. The amount of custom mods, levels, and conversions are staggering. A mutiplayer community that is still active and the game series that defined Deathmatch. What more could you really ask for?			",156,13,1,5,3,0,11

												At the time of writing there are over 400 positive reviews and about 30 negative ones. This game is still good after 20 years! Yes it shows it's age but the gameplay and level design (not to meation the kick @$$ soundtrack) all made up for the graphics. Even then the graphics are appealing to look unlike the gray, unispired modern day shooters. Weapons are easy to switch between and like in Serious Sam and Duke Nukem (That were inspired by this game) you'll find yourself switching weapons on the fly. Use Shotgun on the Imps, chaingun on Picky demons, BFG on cybor demon, etc. And with many types of enemies you'll have to learn what gun works best or'll you'll have a bad type.The story is almost non-existant with John Carmack thinking that stories in games weren't important (Oh John we would not have been friends) but like the graphics can be forgiven for the great gameplay overall.So should you buy? Sure. You might need to fix a few files because of DOS box but the steam forms have many a soultion for you. So what are you waiting for? Buy it and kill some demons all ready!

												Badass game, it is one of the first games i played when i was a kid. It has sentimental value for me. Difficult to play nowadays due to bad graphics, but back then it was a very interesting game. The level designs, the mazes, the riddles, the scary environment was something new for the games of 1995. In contrast to Doom I, brought more aspects like new enemies, a new gun and the levels were much more interesting in my opinion. I believe someone who is willing to set aside the graphics matter can find this game cool, only for understanding the evolution of fps games. Some things like aiming, jumping, reloading are taken for granted nowadays, but it wasn't always like that. I believe this game deserves a shot for someone who wants to understand elements of older games, the ideas and efforts of older developers and doesn't care about the bad graphics.			",50,1,1,3,0,0,1

												If you dont know what Doom is, then you've been missing out friendo. One of the best shooters I have ever played in my entire life. Period. And the game that gave birth to every single one of those FPS shooters you've got your grubby mitts on.  And the one that also kick started my love for loud guns and chainsaws c: Sheer, Unbroken action? Check. Satisfying gunplay? Check. All this makes Doom 2 a game you can come back to, time and time again.The mod community is simply outstanding. Perfect for newcomers and a great test of time for Veterans. There's an unwritten rule of the internet. If it exists, there's probably been a WAD (mod) made for Doom. 20+ Years and counting, people still make mods for this.Definitely worth it all your cash and more so. Grab it, dont delay.

												DOOM II's gameplay is much the same as the first game with very few changes.The super shotgun is a fantastic(ally overpowered) addition.  It's satisfying to use, does as much damage as a rocket, and uses pretty common ammo... except most of the levels (Petersen's, so you know who to go strangle blame) are huge, have long sight lines, and are swarmed with monsters that do not drop ammuntion.  The variable lighting from the first game is less present this time around, too.On the note of the level design, I'd like to cite Map 10 in particular:  the only seemingly reasonable way to do this map is to kite every enemy on the map to the entry hallway and gun them down as they catch themselves in chokepoints...  which is what I did, after several failed attempts at running and gunning my way in (since all of the rooms had enough hitscan enemies to make that impossible).The new enemies feel gimmicky and most have very simple strategies associated with them:The giant skeletons will try to punch you if you get near them, but cannot punch and move at the same timeThe flying meatballs will not spawn skulls (or attack in any way) if you are touching themThe archvile's flames will go out if you hide behind a wall (of any width!)Many of them just feel annoying and I'd compare the meatballs to Satan if they weren't already demons.  Fighting them is like stepping on Legos.Granted, I haven't finished the game yet, but I don't think there's much left that could change my mind at this point.  The level design of the first game was probably the best thing about it (although it had a lot going for it), and the second game's level design really does not play towards the game's strengths.  Is it fun?  On the better designed levels, yes.  Is it as good as the first game?  No.  Play DTWID if you want more of the first game.Rip and tear me a new one if you like.  /opinions			",142,23,1,15,5,1,5

												Doom was the successor of the Wolfenstein series, and the second in its series was released in 1994 and will run on any computer system on the planet - unless you're exceptionally unfortunate.Doom 2 is a fun, action packed monster slaying journey. The game has spawned an entire series and several variations have been officially made along with a still-active modding community similar to the still-active modding community of the original Wolfenstein games from id software.In a twist of fate for those of us who understand it well, the story is that Earth has been completely invaded by the monsters of Hell and any survivors were sent into outer space to preserve the human race. Working his way through the hordes of Hell, Doomguy comes to fight the Spider Mastermind, Cyberdemon and finally the Icon of Sin. The icon of sin is the interesting twist, where the icon of sin represents John Romero - the games artist who was disinterested in the games art style and subsequently left id software. There's an easter egg for if you use no clipping and go to the right place, you can see the head of John Romero on a spear and even has animations for when being shot.There are epic fights with countless monsters, and the fun and challenge is nostalgic, undeniable and instantly classic. It should be noted that many of the difficulties of the array of mods and releases feature difficulties intended to be impossible to complete - where some people have actually achieved victory. I find these victories quite impressive.It's cheap, fun, nostalgic, action-packed and runs well on any system, have you any reason not to play Doom at least once in your life?			",141,23,2,7,3,0,6

												(Ignore my hours, this is just so I can post the review)I remember being just lil ol' 10 years old when I bought Doom on XBLA, remembering Doom 3 (I'm young, okay? Late start :P) and I absolutely loved Doom 3, so I figured I'd play this one. Needless to say, it was different. But good different. When I eventually heard that there was a Doom 2, I wanted to play it so badly (this was before I had a PC, so mind you, I didn't know this existed). When I heard Doom 2 was released on XBLA, my brain melted. Bought it same day, downloaded, played it, and oh man, one of the best summers of my life, did I spend playing that game.Doom 2 is a First Person Shooter, and revolutionized the FPS world. The game has considerable length, good scaling in difficulties, good range of weapons and enemies (more than the previous installment), and it's quite fast paced at times. However, playing Doom 2 the default way in Steam means playing it in DosBOX. Personally, I recommend playing it in a program called Zandronum, it makes everything HD while still preserving the ""Doom"" feel. But it's up to you how you want to play.This game is an absolute STEAL for $5, if your only FPS is Call of Duty, buy this game and see a true FPS.10/10			",119,12,0,24,8,1,21

												A classic and historic game, but nonetheless the only reason you should buy it here is...Well, there's really no reason that you should buy it here. You can find DOOM2.WAD very easily online.The mods available for Doom are almost as plentiful as those for the Source engine (and sometimes of high enough quality to be standalone commercial games), so go out there and find some good wads once you get bored of the original game! I recommend Alien Vendetta, Sunder, Hell Revealed, Speed of Doom, Brutal Doom, UAC Ultra, and Hell Revealed 2 to get you started. With the exception of Brutal Doom and UAC Ultra, these are all considered ""Slaughter"" wads and are often -extremely- difficult. These wads also push the engine well past the limits of most older and many modern computers. Consider beating Doom II on Ultra-Violence to be a prerequisite for mods like these. They're very fun and the sheer amount of wads available can keep you entertained for years. Quite a bit more can be found at doomworld/idgames.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, I love this game to death and even grew up with it when I couldn't afford a ps1. I used to play the Sega and PC version of this game and beat it over ...so many times I can't count. Second of all...seriously, when you open the game you gotta press escape to open the menu. It isn't a loading screen, you'd have to do the same thing with the original doomMy biggest problem is the mouse on this game, as much as I love this game, this is a pretty bad port. Just go play Zdoom, but if you wanna support steam or something then buy this. Idk why you arn't playing Brutal Doom or ROK			",72,8,0,9,12,0,1

												Doom was the successor of the Wolfenstein series, and the second in its series was released in 1994 and will run on any computer system on the planet - unless you're exceptionally unfortunate.Doom 2 is a fun, action packed monster slaying journey. The game has spawned an entire series and several variations have been officially made along with a still-active modding community similar to the still-active modding community of the original Wolfenstein games from id software.In a twist of fate for those of us who understand it well, the story is that Earth has been completely invaded by the monsters of Hell and any survivors were sent into outer space to preserve the human race. Working his way through the hordes of Hell, Doomguy comes to fight the Spider Mastermind, Cyberdemon and finally the Icon of Sin. The icon of sin is the interesting twist, where the icon of sin represents John Romero - the games artist who was disinterested in the games art style and subsequently left id software. There's an easter egg for if you use no clipping and go to the right place, you can see the head of John Romero on a spear and even has animations for when being shot.There are epic fights with countless monsters, and the fun and challenge is nostalgic, undeniable and instantly classic. It should be noted that many of the difficulties of the array of mods and releases feature difficulties intended to be impossible to complete - where some people have actually achieved victory. I find these victories quite impressive.It's cheap, fun, nostalgic, action-packed and runs well on any system, have you any reason not to play Doom at least once in your life?			",141,23,2,7,3,0,6

												DOOM II's gameplay is much the same as the first game with very few changes.The super shotgun is a fantastic(ally overpowered) addition.  It's satisfying to use, does as much damage as a rocket, and uses pretty common ammo... except most of the levels (Petersen's, so you know who to go strangle blame) are huge, have long sight lines, and are swarmed with monsters that do not drop ammuntion.  The variable lighting from the first game is less present this time around, too.On the note of the level design, I'd like to cite Map 10 in particular:  the only seemingly reasonable way to do this map is to kite every enemy on the map to the entry hallway and gun them down as they catch themselves in chokepoints...  which is what I did, after several failed attempts at running and gunning my way in (since all of the rooms had enough hitscan enemies to make that impossible).The new enemies feel gimmicky and most have very simple strategies associated with them:The giant skeletons will try to punch you if you get near them, but cannot punch and move at the same timeThe flying meatballs will not spawn skulls (or attack in any way) if you are touching themThe archvile's flames will go out if you hide behind a wall (of any width!)Many of them just feel annoying and I'd compare the meatballs to Satan if they weren't already demons.  Fighting them is like stepping on Legos.Granted, I haven't finished the game yet, but I don't think there's much left that could change my mind at this point.  The level design of the first game was probably the best thing about it (although it had a lot going for it), and the second game's level design really does not play towards the game's strengths.  Is it fun?  On the better designed levels, yes.  Is it as good as the first game?  No.  Play DTWID if you want more of the first game.Rip and tear me a new one if you like.  /opinions			",142,23,1,15,5,1,5

												When I was about 4 years old, I played this game. 7 years later, I still am (Im 11 by the way). A lot of my friends like COD and GTA games, and would care less about a game like this. But somewhere, inside of me, I still have a large amount of young nostalgia in me, and this happens to be a highlighted game for me. You won't be able to find any good old-school FPS games better than DOOM, Ultimate DOOM, DOOM II, and Final DOOM. All of these games, including Id Software's other games, have been in my life forever, and always will. You must get this game if you also have that nostalgia that I have, and even get it if you have never played the game before. Especially if you play games like COD, and would like to try a new game. The gameplay is phenomonal, and the replay value is also great through the majority of the game. I highly recomend this game. :D ",8,0,0,0,1,0,0

But this game improved on the original sooo much, and the Super Shotgun still can not be beat as the most satisfyingly awesome weapon in any FPS. Also, this was the first that really took off with LAN and online play. It's hard for the XBOX generation to appreciate. DOOM rules!!			",541,239,11,61,54,7,104

												One of the first games to Start the Whole entire FPS Genre and the Doom Series in General...Which that is DOOM II, Everything about this game is fun, When it comes to the Weapons, Maps and Demons! Back in the Day This game was Way ahead of this time springing off into the most ""Gruesome Game Ever"" But Who cared, Everyone loved DOOM! You play as a Space Marine of course in Space which you are apart of the UAC, But one day the UAC is over overrunned by a bunch of Demons and all your pals are dying apon you, And the only thing you can do is try to survive and Advance to the next Level! That says it all, There is not much to talk about this game only it being the best game ever! If you haven't play DOOM for yourself then this game might just be for you if you are willing to try DOOM. I Mean come on it's DOOM, It's one of those games that you have to play...But i would like to say since this is a very old game and the game runs through DOSBOX The Controls, Graphics and the Engine itself doesn't hold up to Today Standards, I would recommend downloading Zandronum. You'll Be able to Play Multiplayer and Co-op mode with other people, Being able to run the game in 1080p or higher, Being able to run Doom modifications, Better Graphics and even having the ability to look up and down!Zandronum Download: https://zandronum.com/downloads/zandronum2.1.2-win32-installer.exeOverall Rating: 10/10			",100,3,1,5,2,0,1

												It's DOOM. What else is there to say other than the fact that this game is pretty badass. I've never played anything before DOOM 3 though, so I'm diving into this with a vague idea of what it is and honestly, I like it. Fast paced FPS combat along with a satisfying arsenal of weaponry coupled with unique monsters to take on? Pretty damn good, I say. One thing to note though is that the game is quite old. Like 1990-plus-maybe-late-90's-crap-I'm-lazy-to-search-that-up graphics and sounds.  And gameplay is very old school, so don't expect iron sights, sprinting or health regeneration. What it is, though, is a fun reminder to what got the FPS ball rolling. Hell, maybe DOOM invented it in the first place. Either way, get it if you like moving at 200 km/h whilst dodging demons and projectiles whilst also blasting them to bits. An added bonus are the mods. HDoom, anyone?			",121,6,3,10,8,0,22

												While this is written for Doom II, the entier Classic Doom series (look for Doom Classic Complete) is absolutely and positiely THE most essential, must-have old school FPS series from its era.  If you are a fan of old school FPS notstalgia, you will get more time out of Doom than you will out of Wolfenstein, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake, or any other old school 'shoot what moves' FPS game or franchis on the planet. In additon to the original 'official' levels - around 150 of them in the Doom Classic Complete package - and many of them can be played several different ways -  there are literally many hundreds if not even thousands of free custom levels that are well worth playing and cost not a dime to download off the Internet for free, many matching or exceeding the quality of the best official levels. Unless you are purely not a fan of the genre, or totally removed from the old school of games, I can't stress enough how essential, important, and monumental of a franchis Classic Doom really is. You'll just have to take my word based on what I've already said.			",60,2,1,0,2,0,0

												""Let the addiction begin. Again."" This statement is VERY true and will remain as a fact for years to come. First off, I would recommend playing the first Doom (Ultimate Doom is the Steam version) since it helps with the small story, but also because it's a great game as well...but this game is the best one. Despite the old graphics and that the game must run on a DOS box for everything to work, you will have a blast with this game. They added some minor things such as enemies, guns, and (of course) new well-designed levels. Let me give you a summary of what this game is...grabbing a gun or CHAINSAW and slicing or shooting demons straight in the face so you can save all of mankind. This is game is basically just a way to get some good, stress-reliving, gory action, and it's all for you (if you purchase it)! Not to mention you get the ""Master Levels of Doom II"" with this, so you can continue to play just a little longer! And there are SO MANY secrets, that the game is easy to replay again...and again...and again...until your heart as beaten every boss, discovered every secret there is, and to get that 100% in the kills! This game will keep you up better than any coffee (even though coffee is good), and leaving you wanting more for a very long time (or decent amount  of time)...Summary: Grabbing weapons and killing MORE demons than last time. And the epic conclusion of the original ""Doom Guy"".			",92,21,1,18,2,0,4

												Set the gold standard for the FPS genre along with its predecessor. Doom 2 nearly doubles the number of enemy types from the previous game, its maps are bigger and even more packed with monsters, and you get a cool new double-barrel shotty to blast them all away with. It's mod collection pretty much dwarfs the original's, whose was already huge.Downloading the GZDoom sourceport to run the game is strongly recommended as it will help with most issues you may have getting it to run on a modern system, greatly expands graphics and control options, and supports the vast majority of mods.

Drum-tight core gameplay, varied enemies, creative levels and good replayability by itself, but it also boasts one of the oldest, largest and most active modding scenes. Thanks to Id releasing the source-code for Doom, it has since been ported to every system under the sun, plus vastly improved on PC through engine replacements such as GZDoom, enabling a whole, massive generation of mods capable of doing far more than the developers originally dreamed possible.Doom 2 isn't just as good now as it was 22 years ago.

												Doom II is the sequel to one of the most innovative, important and legendary games of all time. Doom II is, in all senses of the word, a better game than the original. While it doesn't add a whole lot, it does add one of the greatest FPS weapons of all time, the Super Shotgun, and some more enemies, and thrity-one new open and fun levels, two of them secrets.Today however, it can be a bit hard to get into Doom II, seeing how the engine is twenty years old and that can take some getting used to. There is no vertical mouselooking, meaning you cannot look up or down with the mouse, only left and right, and moving around in general can be awkward as moving the mouse forward moves the player forward.That doesn't make it something you shouldn't play through though, it's an important piece of gaming history and is still fun to play if you're a fan of old-school styled FPS's like myself. It's still a joy to run through these classic levels pumping demons full of lead. Just put yourself in the right mindset and remember that Doom II is an old man now, and you'll enjoy your time with it.			",178,16,0,17,7,0,20

												Doom 2 is a classic that maintains its fun to this day. At first glance, it looks very similar to Doom 1, using many of the same graphics, the same gunplay, and the same arsenal (plus the new double barrelled shotgun). Where this game differs from its predecessor is in the level design and overall flow of the combat. Whereas Doom 1 was very mazelike and encounters were more personal with a handful of enemies, this game frequently drops you in huge, open areas and sometimes throws dozens of enemies at you at once. The double barrelled shotgun changes the fight dynamics a great deal. Where the Pink demons were a challenge in the first game, they can be dispatched with one blast, and other enemies that were difficult to deal with are similarly cut down to size. To compensate for this, Doom 2 introduces a handful of new, more offensively focused enemies, such as the mancubus and revenant, which shoot rockets at you, and the archvile that catches you on fire and resurrects the dead. The effect that all of this has is that encounters in Doom 2 are usually more intense and challenging. As is the case in every classic Id software game, the level design is brilliant and encourages a kind of exploration you just don't get in today's FPS games. The levels are large and sprawling, but the clever design gives each level a sense of direction and flow, so you generally know where to go next. I can think of exactly two spots where the way to continue was overly obtuse (for those interested:  there was a keycard hidden in a very obscure place in the level ""Refueling Base"" and having to shoot part of the wall to open a door in a level called ""The Spirit World"" ). Still, two bad spots in a campaign that lasts about 9 hours total isn't bad at all. Visually, this game is very obviously old, and yet I still find it pleasant to look at. If you really must have modern graphics, there are plenty of mods to accomplish that, but the aesthetic of this game is so well realized that it's beautiful to look at thanks to the downright surreal and creative art direction.The singleplayer experience of Doom 2 stays fun for the entire duration of the game and is an absolute joy to play. Even though this game is 20 years old, the multiplayer scene is surprisingly strong thanks to the fact that iD software released the engine's source code for free, allowing people to create programs such as Zandronum and ZDaemon (both of which I reccomend highly for multiplayer) that allow players to connect with ease. The deathmatch mode of Doom 2 is hands down one of the most fun deathmatch games I've ever played. Everyone moves ridiculously fast and you will initially find yourself getting lost in a volley of rockets and shotgun blasts. The deathmatch gets so chaotic that it can become almost incomprehensible at times, but I find myself getting used to it after a few rounds and eventually making sense of it all. There are no perks or killstreaks here, just pure reflexes and strategy. Knowing which weapon to use in which situations is key for survival and the game is surprisingly accessible for new players as long as you just practice (despite playing singleplayer Doom games for a long time, I just started playing Doom multiplayer this year and generally hold my own in matches and manage to win every now and then). Co-Operative modes are also very popular and even though I prefer deathmatch, there is tons of fun to be had in co-op (one defense-based mod in particular gives you money for every demon you defeat, which allows you to purchase buildings for a base you have to protect, which is pretty fun). There are a ton of user-made mods and maps available to try out as well, so purchasing this game (although I would really encourage getting the whole series as well) is a great investment as you will get acces to a great amount of content.

												Despite is low pixel and♥♥♥♥♥♥ it`s still pretty bloody, scary, and most of all, fun. The levels get harder and more challenging (which I feel didn`t happen in the first Doom game), the new weapons are awesome (even though there`s only like, 1 or 2 (excluding Unmaker). But what surprised me most of all was how scary it was, whether it was a jump scare behind the last door or the fear of being killed by something, or because of the sheer ugliness of it. Overall, fun game 10/10 recommended to anyone who likes gory and violent games.			",50,1,0,1,2,0,0

												Nostalgia, classic FPS and kick-a$$ music? You get the big motherf*cker Doom Series. There's nothing more satisfying than to hear your enemy scream when they die of your firepower. Going 40+ miles per hour? Thats just the basic for Doom Guy. And last but not the least, it's one of my favorite FPS, much more favored than the any of the CoD games and Battlefield. Guys, get this game to prove that you're a man and playing this will definitely and utmostly make you the most bad-a$$ son of a b***h to touch Mother Nature's dirt. Sergio, I'm looking at you. The challenges of this game is more intense than your game of chess. I'd say flip that chess board over and take on some Doom 2 to kill those a$$holes who don't belong in your reality. Guys......BUY THIS GAME. Or have Doom Guy shove his fist through your beating heart just to aim down his BFG.			",101,6,6,8,7,0,4

												Timeless FPS classic and loads of fun, even though the game is very old both graphically and mechanically, there's plenty of fan made port of the source code for the Doom engine that modernizes the game, the ones I like the most are Doom Legacy, Doomsday Engine, Zdoom and of course Zdaemon.This classic is non-stop frenetic action blowing hordes of demons, and it never gets old, plus this game has the most satisfying double-barrel shotgun in any video game.There's also lots mods available like Brutal Doom that make the experience even more fun.I keep coming back to this one every year to dismember a bunch of demons.

												Even after all this time...... Doom 2...... how simple yet how engrossingly addictve. With all the cash cows in the world of the FPS (I'm looking at you COD) with their generic and never evolving formulas.... its nice to go back to a time when the concept was brand new and play a game which in my opinion is infinately better.Here's to you Doom 2.... for throwing armies and armies of the undead at us till they fill the screen and then attempting to throw more. To YOU for giving us a multiplayer coop campaign before it was a buzzword. It's 5 bucks..........come on!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whats not to love about DOOM its one of the first FPS games ever made. I maybe a bit bias BUT THIS IS ONE MOTHER TRUCKING AWSOME GAME  & YOU CANT SPELL DOOM WITH OUT CAPS YEAHHHH!!!!!Sorry got over exsited lets get on with the review for DOOM III can rember playing this when i was 6-7  at home in the dark scarybut the main changes to this and ultimate Doom is harder levels, new wepon super shotgun and diffrent enermys along with DOOM! Its still got an active modding comunity there are tons of extra maps you can get at no cost if you know where to look if you get doom builder make your own level challenge your friends.Best part is you dont need to know how to use any code script etc...If you are craving some type of zombie mode if your a cod zombie lover  just create a level with  a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of enermys and see how long you can last  or try the NUTS wad trust me its fun to play. This version is a bit lacking in graphical style but what do you expect from the early 90s i think its just a beuatiful as when i first played it and you get that nostalgic feeling There are some source ports that  will add extra pretty grafics as well as up down look and jumps and other things like the selfie stick lmao i mean ok its not how i rember playing DOOM  but its worth a go if the orginals a bit dated for you or you feel like spiceing things up :)but i do encourage you if you have not played this befor to play the original i urge you if you havent played it or if you have in the past to get this awsome game if you do not own it as its soo much fun especialy if you and a few friends death match or co op the campaigne on nightmare dificulty another reason to buy are the levels are almost not scripted like cod and BFthey are well crafted and they have secrets filled of demons or goodys :)OH AND A BIG P.Syou call of duty and battlefield fan boys should have to salute and bow down to this demon slaying bad♥♥♥♥♥that is DOOM GUY!!!!coz if DOOM didnt exsist neither will cod or BFpeace out guys hope you like my review :)			",243,8,3,5,4,2,2

												An epic continuation of the original classic. Also, like with the last game, look into an engine mod in order to be able to use mods, play at 1080p (or even higher) and be able to look up and down and be able to jump (although admittedly jumping does kind of ruin some levels with shortcuts.)And if you are afraid of it becoming stale if you already beat the first one, install the Brutal DOOM mod, because it is  ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME.	 Almost felt like an entirely different game with it installed. 10/10 would install mod and throw lost souls at walls and rips the eyes out of cacodemons again.			",276,43,2,14,16,4,13

												Hell on earth is the sepuel to the original doom.I still think Doom 1 is the better game but Doom 2 (or II) is still mostly the same with more demons and one new gun - The Super Shotgun (double-barral shotgun).The levels are more detaled and much bigger than the first. There is also a secret level based on wolfenstein and if you type IDCLIP and walk throght the Icon of sin (the final boss) you can see a familiar face... But I woan't spoil it you have to play the game to see for yourself!I'd also recommed the first game or the ""Ultimate"" Doom			",48,0,0,2,3,0,0

												Well it cam after Doom  so how is it. The story takes place after the first were the demons invade earth story is basic but who gives a damn. The gameplay is pretty much the same with a new weapon the super shotgun. Levels are well designed, challenging, and sometimes you may get lost. The new enemies are just badass like the hell knight and the revenant which look like something out of a judas preist cover. The music is very atmospheric and badass. The problems is that it can get repetative and the level design can be confusing in some parts. Maybe the best doom game ever due to the new enemies and super shotgun.9.5/10 just as great as ultimate doom highly recommend it			",340,5,1,7,5,2,4

Its time to KILLI had some trouble getting it to run on windows 8.1. There are some easy fix you can find online.

												Fight your way threw waves of monsters invading earth in this PC cult classic. Doom II has set the way for PC gaming since the 90's and it's still one of the most if not THE most cult classic PC game ever made.Game play: 9 out of 10Being a game from the 90's doesn't stop this game from having some of the best game play for it's time. It may not be Call of Duty, or Half-life but it has really solid game. Doom II is the “Guns! Guns! Even more guns!” kinda of game play. Doom II is a simple a first person shooter, you move, you shoot, you get keys, to unlocked doors and find hidden stuff. Nothing over the top. However back in the 90's it didn't matter. It how many guns can I use to take out these monsters.While Doom has it fair share of weapons, It has a great design of monsters monsters and more monsters! Everything from your basic zombie soldier, to huge♥♥♥♥♥cyber demons ready to rip you apart at a moments notice. Each monster has there own style of game play. Some has simple things like a shot gun, or a melee attack, Some have more magical powers like fireballs or setting you on fire, while some are Cybernetic enhanced demons using rocket launchers or having a spider body with a chain gun on it. Whatever the case maybe this game doesn't sell you short on the fun factor. Doom also uses the color key/door system. Meaning you have to search around from room to room finding these keys to advance in each level. In Doom II you do not have to really Aim at the targets it pretty much aims for you by using an auto aim system since you can't really look up and down and such. Pretty much means you can be standing on top of something and shoot something below you and not even be aiming or looking at it. There are ways to change this of course but please read blow for more info on that.The maps are very well design, with each one having a different theme to them. However unlike games now of days one level leads into the next which leads into the next one Doom doesn't really have a set “level” design on how you go from one map to the next map. It's pretty much like an episodic tv show where you have the “flavor” or “theme” of the day. Here it's more so the “Flavor” or “theme” of the map.There are a decent amount of power ups, You have Berserk mode, Radioactive suit, full map, and more. Each adds a little bit more to the game play element which adds even more fun to the game as it is.Story: 5 out of 10.Doom it's self has a good story... if you read the novels and such however the game it's self gives you a more simple smaller version of the story. There isn't much there to really work with. It's mainly about demons and monster that have came from hell that are invading earth and it's your job to stop it. Short and simple. This game isn't about the over all story as it is. It's mainly about kill everything that gets in your way.Graphics: 9 out of 10.Of course the graphics are pretty bad compare to games now but for it's time they where amazing. It's a 3D game with 2d rending sprites. Every NPC and items around the maps them self’s are 2D sprites that “follows” you. Pretty much whenever you step left or right it will turn and keep looking at you. While there are times when the graphics of NPC's and items can look flat by the way you are looking at them, but doesn't effect the game play.The over all graphics are set to be more Gorey/ Horror themed with a dark gloomy setting. While a lot of maps focus on a certain theme for each one, you can get the over all feel they where going for.Music: 10 out of 10.This music in this game is amazing. For being midi files it is top notice. The music is midi version of song like Master of Puppets by metallica to other big named bands. The sound track will have to coming back for more. Doom has one of the best sound tracks in history for video games. Extra: Mods and such:Til this day Doom is the most modded PC game ever. People are still making maps, skins, game mods, movies, and more much. This show you have much love this game has gotten over the years.Now there are some mods that I personally use that i recommend to people to enhance your game play better if you so choose.The mods I use are as followed:Brutal DoomZandronum (single player and online).Brutal Doom takes the game and makes it even more Gorey and well brutal. This enhance the game play by adding more weapons, Alt fires for every weapons, Finishers, Harder mode settings, and much more. If you looking for one of the best mods out there for doom check out Brutal Doom mod. After installing this mod I can't go back to the basic doom game anymore.Zandronum, is a mod that allows more enhanced game play to let you have free camra look, to allowing you to aim and not use auto aim. Allowing online play with friends or random people you meet or find on servers. There are a lot of different one like this out there. I use this one because it was recommended by Brutal doom for a better game play.Other mods:Skin modsMapsGunsPower UpsGame modesThese are some of the thing you can find, Skins for weapons, or NPC's. Maps from doom style maps to playing inside walmart or McDonalds. Guns, so when you get tired of the normal guns you can just add more! I mean who doesn't want the Rick Roll BoomBox gun Mod? Anyone? Anyone? Even more power ups and more game mods. There are so many mods out there that there are web sites dedicated to just that.Cheat does:There are a decent list of codes that can be use to give you powers like God mode, All weapons, Noclip and such. I don't recommend using them unless you have play this game so much that you're looking to spice things up a bit.Cheat Engine:This is a bit off for what I am reviewing. However I have used cheat engine to enhance my game play allowing more than what you can do in the game it's self. There are options in game that allows faster monsters, and respawning monster which is can be hard enough as it is. However I like to turn speed hack on and give myself x2 speed while giving the monster even more speed. It adds more of a challenge to the game and I don't recommend this to everyone unless your looking for a challenge.I know when I started playing doom back in the 90's for the first time. 5 year old me had so many nightmares because of this game but I couldn't put it down and ever since then I have forever loved doom.  Doom was my first ever FPS game and because of doom, FPS games have become my personal favorite style of video games.Overall score: 9.5 out of 10.Despite not having much of a story being there is. It makes up with everything else. If your looking for a story based game I wouldn't recommend this game to you. However if you want something insanely fun that's mindless then I recommend this game.If you are new to Doom or never heard of it, You SHOULD do your self a favor and play this game.

												There's not much to say. It's one of the best shooters ever made, and it just doesn't get old. Developers were nice enough not to just port the game with original graphics, but also include Steam Cloud integration, so you don't ever have to worry about losing your save games again. Obviously it also works with all the mods just like non-Steam version too.NOTE: The game is obviously runing on DOSBox so Steam overlay won't work.			",263,91,15,25,10,3,30

												Don't get me wrong, Doom II is awesome and I am in no way discouraging anyone from playing it. In fact, I encourage everyone to give it a try at least once because it is a great game. I am, however, discouraging people from purchasing this version of it because it leaves a lot to be desired. As other reviews have pointed out, this version simply gives you a very basic version that runs through Dosbox. I don't think that this alone would be all that bad, but I cannot find a way to customize the controls, which are quite bad.This is how I feel about this version and if this doens't bother you, then by all means grab this one because it is fine otherwise.

												So I played Doom 2 back when I was a kid.  Back then I found the game stupid hard to the point I had to cheat to win.  I went back and played it recently and the game is amazing.  Yes its old but I still have more fun with this game than with the modern shooters we have.  How is this concept hard for todays games.  There's guns. Theres' an exit.  you'll have to find the exit on your own by using the guns to blast through a parade of crazy demons that will murder you if you are not very careful.  Thats it. No bloated in your face unnecessary exposition that breaks pace, a few text prompts you can mash the space bar to dissapear and get back to killin stuff.  The game is challenging, fun, thrilling and 5 friggin dollars.  Buy it and enjoy.			",125,14,1,25,2,2,8

												When I bought this game, I was expecing to play for hours once again, just like the old days. First time starting it up. No problem. I played for about 10 minutes until the game closed itself. Bummer. I tried to get it running again but no matter what I did, I was unable to get it working again. I even redownloaded the game but nothing worked.Don't get me wrong, I love this game so much. However, I do not recommend that you buy this game because apperently the game is too old to be played well on modern devices. Which I think is also weird, since I was able to play for those 10 minutes.Conclusion: Don't buy this game unless you're willing to alter files and download other programs to get this game working.

												Doom II is by far the hardest i probably played next to the 1st Doom. It has BIGGER maps, with MORE enemies, and at some point, MORE complicated puzzles that puts you in confusion on where to go and what to find.The 1st Doom is hard, but this is HARDER. The game is hard as HELL on highest difficulty, and you have to fight through hell (literally) to beat the level. Of course all i said was from highest difficulty i played, so to those who are hardcore gamers, i say try this.Of course the set up is oldschool, so if you dont know then get to know it because its not really that hard once you understand the concept of oldschool setups (such as typing in notepad on the file, etc.).I'll admit the setup is quite boring, but the gameplay is where it'll ALWAYS keep your eyes widened and keep you going.Update: This game I would strongly recommend it because you can play with certain modifications like zDoom or gzDoom (in my case, I played gzDoom). Get it, its free to download and you are required to get this game in order to play it especially on modern computers alongside modern controls if you cant handle the classic stuff.Furthermore you can also play mods. For me, I play modded campaigns. So meaning, new levels and probably new story as well depending which mods you are playing. The challenge is very interesting too. If you want mods, I would usually either check Moddb or google the name of the mods. Or check youtube if you wish to see how it goes, especially typing ""Doom mods"" or ""Top Doom wads"".I will promise you, the day you start playing mods like this you will likely will never see the sun again. Experience wise, beated about over 20 mods (wads) and majority of them is megawads (which usually holds 32 levels (30 without secrets)). It has everything you need to make Doom modern (well except graphics of course lol). Like the ability to look up and down, or change controls through game, etc.But yeah, get this, then download the modification. If you havent beat the original, you can either do it now after purchase or get gzDoom (again if you cant handle the classic controls).You can do all that just from buying this game, so go for it if you want to do all this awesome stuff.

												Doom II: Hell on Earth is the pinnacle of the Doom series. If you’re going to play a classic Doom game from the 90s, you play this one. Skip all the crap like Final DOOM, Master levels, etc. This game has everything those games have and more. The sound quality is freaking crisp for an antique game, and the level design and depth just blows every other run and gun game out of the water. The monster variety is insane, and will leave you constantly surprised to see new enemies. If the game gets too hard, get a few friends to team up and coop with you. If the game gets old, download a few thousand maps off the internet and continue your journey. This game is the perfect classic, highly recommend for hardcore pc gamers to play this at least once.

												You would think that shooters nowadays would have been much more advanced than DOOM at this point...but sadly DOOM is still more advanced than most shooters.  Other than some exceptions, DOOM still has more going on in it than the prevalent corridor shooters of today where you travel from point A to B in a straight line with just pretty things to look at on the way.  DOOM has switches, pressure plates, working elevators, traps, hidden walls/rooms, working doors...You're lucky if you even get to open a door in a modern shooter without clearance from Captain Price firstlmao.More like Captain FISHER-PRICE.

												Doom II is among one of my favourite games and is truly a morbid rush, if you love bombs, guns, rockets and gore i recommend this, i tend to play wads more than the original game based on steam and among my favourites is the Columbine wad, it architects the school very well and is very accurate to the real school along with the 9mm's and the Shotguns packed with a few pipe bombs to go along on the rampage, it feels like the closest simulation to murder at columbine you'll find.

												I’ve always loved how ID Software always goes with II instead of 2 for it sequels.  The double I just looks cooler than a 2.  Any ways, Doom II isn’t that much beyond Doom.  A little polish here, a new gun there, a bunch of new bosses, and a new story.Basically I put this in the hardcore/fanboy category   If you want to play them all play it.  If you want to play everything ID, play it.  If you want to play all the classic games, play Doom.  Sadly there is no real need to play Doom II, unless you just really love the Doom Series.  And don’t get me wrong its a great series.Play Doom II or don’t, its really that simple…			",379,53,20,28,68,7,68

												Why they didn't just use the Doom95 client and decided to box an old version of DOSBox into this is absolutely beyond me.  Had to mess around with files to get the DOSBox client not to crash at the title screen, which peeved me a little.  Get into the game and moving the mouse forward makes me run forward!  This wasn't a thing with Doom95, but again, I have to go Google a solution(another download).  Finally, I'm not sure how to run other .WADs without even more noodling around - Doom95 let you pick a WAD in the autorun screen.  This?  Nope, just boots the DOSBox client and you're into Doom2.WAD or whatever the default WAD is.  You'd have to import the mod into the directory and rename it to Doom2.WAD every time you want to change WADs, I guess. I owned Doom II on CD as a kid, came with Doom95, and you just ran the client and in you went, no hassle.  This was the late '90s-early 2000s.  Yet instead of using that, they decide to package the DOS version...I got this in a package with the first Doom(which, again, already beat on the 360 but figured it'd be nice to play on the PC), Final Doom and Master Levels for Doom II(which I didn't own) and they're all the same way(I could do the WAD-swap trick I mentioned up there).  Classic games, but the porting job?...ouch!  At $5, I'm not sure I'm in any position to complain, but...couldn't they have at least used the Doom95 client instead of the DOS version?

												What can be said about Doom 2 that hasn't been said already? This game is a masterpiece of game design, not something that one would expect from a concept as simple as ""if it moves, shoot"".They don't say this is the father of FPS for nothing. And I for one feel that it surpasses most, if not all, FPS games in terms of sheer fun factor - and isn't that why we play games in the first place?Something that needs saying, though, is that the copy of Doom that Steam gives you is...well, it's what you would've got had you bought it back in the day. Needless to say, a game as great as this has been improved upon by its many fans; mods have been put together that enchance the vanilla experience.			",363,82,28,25,32,7,60

DooM II: Hell On Earth		* 10/10DooM II: Hell On Earth on Steam		* 0/10I believe there's not much to say about DooM. Not the first FPS, but I could say it's ""The First Bad@$$ FPS Ever. PERIOD"". Why the 2 rates? Let's say the 10/10 rate is related to the Game itself (or every Pros I've though of and listed) while the 0/10 is related to the Game As a Steam Release (Everything is listed in the Cons Section). Consider that I grew up with doom, I was 6 years old when the shareware was being widespread all over the world, and still nowadays I own The original DooM, DooM II and The Ultimate Collection DooM 95 (With Ultimate DooM, DooM II And Final DooM). Despite all this I regret to NOT Recommend this RELEASE (Not THE GAME, mind you). On a Side note: all the DooM chapters have been released on Steam like this, so I'm not recommending Any other chapter, specifically The Ultimate DooM, Final DooM nor even the Master levels for DooM II. My same Review will be posted in all those releases because of the same flaws.+++PROs+++The Following Points are the reason I MUST recommend this GameFPS. The genre was defined by THIS game (Yes, yes, there was Wolfenstein before, but the mainstream came with DooM overwhelming popularity). I still feel Adrenaline while sporting around an arsenal of weapons through Maps totally full of monsters and a gameplay that can be summarized as ""shoot (or run through) everything that moves and get to the exit"". Sounds lame but everything started from here, and simpler things are not boring here. They're Fun. MUSIC. It's a widely known story and it's true. Most of the bad@$$ music you hear in game are nothing but ripoffs from famous Metal or Hard Rock famous songs. How could a game be more Bad@$$ than this? MODS. One of the most Modded game ever. There are even lots of Ports, because DooM originally is a DOS game so it always had few issues with windows' environment (mainly audio related, who remembers autoexec.bat, dos=high umb and other damn DOS lines like them? XD). Lots of famous mods, that can revolutionize the gameplay (like Brutal Doom), or even new maps (See Alien DooM), or totally messed up demented projects (like the Italian And somehow Satyrical/blatantly blasphemous Grezzo 2... I am told it's greatly appreciated around the world... even though most characters are italian or from italian Television, and everything is written/spoken in italian... so... O.o). There are even lots of guides, both in steam and in other sites, with solutions to all of the CONs I've listed.---CONs---The following points are the reason I will NEVER recommend this release on Steam. STEAM OVERLAY. This release runs directly with dosbox, so obviously the overlay won't work. THE PORT. Actually this release has no ports... It's the usual game that runs on DosBox... Which is not the best solution because it's just an emulation of a DOS Environment which means that you can easily experience some minor LAGs, both on video and audio. Not to mention the inferior Midi quality. On top of that it has 2 options, the classic input and the DEFAULT ""Modern input"" with WASD Movement AND Mouse MOVEMENT...Not Mouselook, MOVEMENT. So obviously you can't use the mouse because it goes in conflict with the WASD keys... And you can't use the arrows because ONLY Left and Right are Binded... WHAT THE F**K?!?!?!?!? WHO THE HELL IS THE INCOMPETENT THAT WORKED ON THIS $H17 AND APPROVED IT?!?!?!?!? AND THIS C**P IS THE DEFAULT SETTING!!!! I know there are solutions inside steam's community discussions and guides, but I don't care, releasing a product of the importance as DooM in this state is SIMPLY RIDICULOUS. And you want to know something? Do you remember the Excellent DooM 95 Port where you have a simple window with tidy options and settings? You even have settings to add Mods. Do you know who worked on that project in his Microsoft's days? GABE NEWELL. And here on Steam I have to find this Garbage on DosBox... I could have Downloaded from google in 2 minutes both the WADs AND a DECENT Port IF (i repeat) IF MY ORIGINAL COPIES  Of DooM, DooM II And ""Ultimate Doom, DooM II And Final With DooM 95"" (Yes I DO OWN ALL OF THEM) were somehow misteriously Burnt out... Steam doesn't consider profitable to ask microsoft a deal to use the best BASIC port for DooM? Fine, Use another one, or make something decent yourself, it's really ridiculous to get such a great game released in such a bad and approximate way... And maybe I'm mistaken, Steam is just a digital distribution platform and the quality of the product released relies on the Developer. It doesn't change anything. The fact that Whoever worked on this release setted the game to play by default with a SELF-CONTRADICTORY INPUT SYSTEM is still RIDICUOUS ... And a reason BIG ENOUGH to AVOID this release LIKE A DISEASE... (Ho-ho-ho, I'm a poet... XD... But seriously, don't waste here your money...) ",495,126,12,20,23,4,28

												I'd love doom 2 if weren't for excessive platforming, added the fact that with mouse function added (althrough is nice) makes movement feel like butter. I don't get why the holding down shift is deafult way of running in most old games like this, (wouldn't it be better if the caps lock could just lock the player into running?).Alot of times I died from falling into a pit than actually getting gunned down by the enemy which I really don't like in doom game. if the game's level design focused more on combat than platforming and map checking I could see myself coming back to this. but as of right now they're better doom games I can play (3 for story, 4 for feels).p.s- the enviroment does little to convey you are on earth nor in hell, (except in the last level). if not told anything I would've thought I was in castle playing mordern d&d with guns.

												Note: Bethesda simply copied DOOM2.wad and .bat into dosbox, so I hope readers won't mind if I copy parts of my Doom 1 Steam review, as this game has the exact same problems.Doom II: Hell on SteamThis ""port"" features terrible modern hardware support. How bad? No OpenGL/DirectX. Software Rendering Only. Locked 480p 4:3 Resolution. Good luck getting it to find your mouse or joypad either. This is only worth buying for the data files, which you should proceed to use in a newer Source Port engine.Calling this a port at all is outright dishonest. This crap got shoved onto steam when Bethesda got the Id catalog, and it's an outdated unpatched dos version running in an emulator. In no way is this a Windows NT port, but a disgusting cashgrab by Bethesda using a DOS emulator they also didn't develop.Any other avenue for legally acquiring those files is better than this. This is an awful hackjob that no one should support Bethesda with. If you don't believe me, go look at Super Noah's Ark 3-D. There is nothing preventing these games from running the way they should but Bethesda.If you buy this and don't leave an extremely negative review, you are personally contributing to these bad ports on steam. Any and all encouragement to buy this by Curators should be met with extreme distrust and assumption of shilling. You can't play this as it ships and leave with a good impression unless you are a fool completely ignorant of PC Gaming and DOOM. As someone who has spent hundreds of hours playing DOOM, as someone who considers DOOM 1 to be in the high end of their Top 5 Games of All Time and DOOM 2 in their Top 10, this is not how you should experience doom. Buyer Beware.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: IE 5 PC games preview - Doom 2 (1994) 

			Views: 1,168		

			This is a nostagic preview from IE (Interactive entertainment) episode 5 , a CD-ROM game magazine.		

Another Great MS-DOS Classic from my Childhood. There's no need to sugar code an Introduction with this game's Cookies & Milk or Shotgun and Shells for that matter.As for the story goes, at The End of the First DOOM, you end up destoying the Demonic Matstermind behind the Invasion of Mars, enter a Portal that leads to your Home on Earth since you won the day and everything is back to Normal... but now your Earth is overrun by Devilspawns as if them being on Mars wasn't bad enough since the Portal you opened was the Gates of Hell themselves. It's up to the Nameless Space Marine to close down Hell's Portal, Hunt down the Demon Hordes & save the Planet Earth from being completely warped.			",577,210,24,80,57,11,94

This may have to do with Dosbox as the source port, but you can fix this by using Zandronum or GZDoom to make the game look more 3D, including display options to change the resolution.

												Double barrel shotgun simulator '94. Forget about the rest of the weapons, because it's so OP with so much ammo and gameplay loop having so much more agency, compared to the rest of the monotone peashooters, that it destroys the whole balance of the game. Also welcome our new hit-scan-weapons overlords chaingunners, chaingunners everywhere; hell knights are just a reskin; arachnotrons are just a sized down spiderdemon with hit-scan chainguns switched to more fun plasma guns; mancubi and pain elementals are truly great; and revenant with arch-vile can either be very interesting or very pointlessly frustrating, depending on the level-design (which is not very great here) due to using seeking missiles and being extremely strong with hit-scan respectively.  Not as good as the first game, because rather often level design drops down to immature troll level, with random hidden passages and barrels. That's why FPS genre is often described as ""random dumb labyrinths"" (though it's nice that the game is now one complete episode). First game (not counting ""thy flesh"") was not like that and most of the time level-design was logical and understandable and really enjoyable. Even final ""boss"" this time is unsatisfactory and dull.Otherwise it's too similar to the first game to talk more about it. If ""more of the same"" is enough for you - then it's for you.

												While it is DooM, and it does have the SSG, I can't recommend this game simply because the level design is just absolutely awful. Of course, it is classic DooM so you should still play it anyway.Don't buy it from here though, bethesda doesn't deserve the money for this game. Get the stuff off of an abandonware site or the freeware version. With a source port like zdoom of course.			",212,12,6,17,2,0,7

												I originally had some pithy ""this game is obviously a classic"" review with a thumbs-up, but I'm rescinding it. The game hasn't changed, but it's packaged in a way that provides the worst possible Doom experience: it uses DOSBox (an emulator) instead of a modern, cross-platform source port such as GZDoom, which would give it proper mouselook, high resolution and widescreen support, and a plethora of visual and usability improvements.It would take some intern at Zenimax about a day to repackage the game for Win/Mac/Lin with such a port, and not much more effort to include a nice launcher for custom WADs, etc (plus say a week to properly QA test it). It would be somewhat more work to add Steam Workshop support, but this would open up access to the largest mod community of any game in history... seems worth it, right?Zenimax owns one of the most important games of all time, and their stewardship of it has been appallingly lazy. There is really no excuse for this, and I will happily edit this review if/when they do better.GZDoom: http://gzdoom.drdteam.orgidgames/ mod repository: https://www.doomworld.com/idgamesMy own WadSmoosh tool: https://bitbucket.org/JPLeBreton/wadsmoosh - use this if you've bought the games here or on GoG etc and want to compile all the official releases into a single file you can easily play in GZDoom.

												The default controls for this game make it nearly unplayable.  From the files that you get from Steam, you can't adjust the controls at all.  From what I can tell, in order to get a playable game, you are expected to find and download third-party software by yourself.  If you don't know where to find a website that you trust to download software that won't end up being malware that destroys your computer, then you're out of luck.  The Xbox 360 version of Doom works perfectly with excelent controls.  If you want to play a game in the Doom series, I would highly reccomend buying it on a console instead of from Steam.

												I have been able to play this at my friend's house and I could say what a time we had, it is an amzing game, from level to level you find secrets, weapons and you blow some shi* up. It is very fun to play online too but the problem is on my PC I cannot get past the loading screen and it's a damn shame for such a great game, these a my specs:Nvidia GeForce GTX 760Seagate 2TB HDDIntel I7 4770K processor16GB DDR3 RAMAnd I'm not very sure of my motherboard.If you have a kind of old PC buy this it's excellent.

Lame Lame Lame.  I loved this game but steam and the  developers can suck a big one because this game simply does not run.  Oh and no sound either on the ""stuck"" main screen.  If it works for others then good for you but I will just load it on my Windows ME (yes ME is better than 98SE!!!!! less blue screens!) private LAN computers from the original disks.  I want it fixed or my mofo money back!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Blah blah classic shooter blah blah doom was the FATHER OF ALL FPS KNEEL BEFO- no. Sure it was fun and you could stay play it as a part of history and to see how far games have come. And I do submit that the level design is great and should be appreciated, BUT the controls are god awful. I couldn't make it through the first level without wanting to smash my mouse into very small bits! Who ever decided we should both move and look with the mouse is a god damned idiot and a blight on the gaming community! You push the mouse forward to move forward, but desks are only so big so you have to pick your hand up and move it back, something I don't feel like doing in a high octane firefight! And aiming is made infinitley more annoying since you'll find your character shuddering back and forth! Maybe its better on controllers, but I didn't get a mechanical key, full RGB, chroma keyboard to use a controller! Seriously ID Software, what did WASD ever do to you?EDIT: Please stop mentioning ZDoom in the comments, I've already been made aware of it, but this review is of DOOM II itself, not any modifications made by the community that better it.

												anyone who thinks that DOOM II still holds up when compaired to more modern games is lying to you.it just doesn't.games have evolved better graphics, better sound, better level desgin, better story, better lighting. better everything.the only value this game holds is its history, a history which you can learn on the internet for free with out having to pay 5 dollars.its not a very fun game its rather frustrating and rather boring. take your five dollars and save it for rise of the triad or doom 4.or just get dosbox and emulate this game if its that important you play it.COME AT ME FAN BOYS			",114,15,1,15,8,0,3

Back in the day besides Wolfenstein 3d & Duke 3d it was the revolutionary FPS game till Goldeneye 007 N64 & Halo 1.  I can't say its for everyone, but for nostalgia, it certainly takes me back to the 90's and In case its not good enough for the 2000's kids with it not having enough graphics, blood, and gore, Brutal Doom helps. ;)Still those pixeled monsters from a distance. :D			",25,1,0,2,3,0,1

												DOOM II was the first DOOM game I played back when I was a teenager.  Back in those days, I spent hours trying to free enough base memory (DOS only gave you 640K) to play games like this.  After getting it running, the frame rate was really choppy and only playable in a reduced size window.  I remember seeing it on a 486 and being wow-ed seeing it run at full screen.  I also remember the first time seeing a chainsaw used as a weapon, which was really unheard of back in those days (Mortal Kombat had not hit the arcades yet).So how does DOOM II hold up after all these years?  I will admit, when I started it up, it looked down right ugly running at full screen.  No joystick compatibility was a bummer as well.  I seem to remember my Gravis gamepad working on the original DOOM II back in the day, which I bought a Creative Labs Sound Blaster card specifically for the joystick port.  The level design seems to hold up well, and I still remembered many of the secret rooms.  I actually jumped a little when an imp popped out behind a hidden door, which I had forgotten about after all of these years.To be honest, I had more fun playing this classic than playing any of the current FPS games.  You press enter, pick a difficulty, and you are playing.  In games these days, you have to sit through minutes and minutes of boring dialogue and cutscenes before you can do anything.  That why I always try to put players in the action as soon as possible in the games that I develop.			",330,72,6,47,24,0,57

												It has been 19 years since Doom 2 was released. Does it hold up to this day, is the game still active? We shall see!Doom 2 is a sequel to the Doom/Ultimate Doom. After when our beloved and badass marine, Doomguy blew a new hole in Spider Mastermind's head, has found the portal which takes him back to Earth. Landed in a meadow our hero looked at the sky and the place itself thinking it is over...That is until he turned his head to the left to find the whole city on fire and Daisy, his pet rabbit had her head cutted off and impaled. But that is not all, people on Earth cannot evacuate the planet as the scums from Hell activated the force field. Being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off you went through to get these hellish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s back where they came from and save the humanity....and avenge your rabbit's gruesome death.While the gameplay is exactly the same as the previous one this time, it is not divided in episodes. It also introduces new enemies such as the Revenant, which it's missiles will automatically follow you or a giant fat blob shooting 3 fireballs at once with each one at different direction and more, one weapon that you will DEFFINETLY fall in love keep using it....the Super Shotgun and some new powerups. The levels are very well made with their secrets cleverly placed and some walls MAY be fake to mess with your mind.The graphics didn't changed since the 1st one except for new decorations, special effects and skyboxes.When it comes to the sound, it applies on new stuff only. Mancubus sounds exactly like a demonic fat blob itself, revenant sounds like a demonic skeleton maniac which pretty much fits etc. while our new gun has a bigger oomph that you cannot stop using it. All the music has been changed and they are memorable and awesome just like the 1st Doom. I just can't get the Spirit World theme out off my head, it is so damn epic (Especially when you use Sound Blaster AWE32 or the General MIDI settings).The game is still active to this day thanks to the community and their mods for some source ports. If you want to enjoy a classic one just get this one without any source ports installed. But if you are pretty curious about single player mods then grab yourself GZDoom and ZDL. When it comes to multiplayer it is STILL active on Zandronum and Zdaemon and two of them are pretty much different. Zandronum uses the OpenGL to be compatible with more advanced mods while Zdaemon is mostly playing in classic style using the ZDoom and DEHACKED coding only.But if you are pretty bored playing the old classic styled gameplay. Get yourself a GZDoom or Zandronum AND Brutal Doom mod for a bigger carnage against the Hellish scums by ripping their heads off with your bare hands, LITTERALY blow their head off while they are looking at their own guts falling off and scream in agony or flip a finger after you bloody murdered the Archvile for good after many times they have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off.

												Ran this on my good old 486. Now it's back on my Gtx 970.I've played tons of FPS games, and have always felt that the most satisfying shotgun in any game ever is in the classic Doom games. The sound, the reload effect, how the enemies turn into a pile of meat and bones, it's just perfect.The game runs great on my Win7-64. The resolution of 320x200 is a bit eye tiring on an 55"" TV. Considering it was designed for 14"" monitors connected to very limited hardware back then, what else could we expect? And considering that's the only negative thing I can say, I believe this is an extremely well aged game. It's the same hell of a fun I experienced 20 years ago.I definitely recommend this game, if you take the word of gamer enchanted by nostalgia.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DOOM II is without a doubt one of the best games of all time. Imploving in almost every way from the original, DOOM II introduces more enemies, more game elements, more levels, and a new weapon. The level design can be hit or miss, and the lack of the chapter system means that to get to a certain level, you will need to play through the whole game unless you have a save. Even though DOOM II suffers from a few problems, it is a classic and extremely fun to go back and play.			",115,8,0,9,6,0,2

												Bigger, badder, more explosive than its predecessor. It's a good game, but it lacks some of the artful cohesion that made the original DOOM so great. The original game did a lot better at telling a story through its level design and gameplay. The levels in DOOM II, by contrast, feel much more abstract, and feel more engineered to antagonize the player than the original DOOM. That said, the mechanics are (for better or worse) exactly the same as the first game, adding one new gun and a host of new upper-mid-tier enemies. There's plenty of great levels here, all things considered, it's just a shame that the sequel to DOOM feels more like a fan-made expansion pack than a full-fledged sequel.Presentation-wise, the Steam version of the game runs through DosBOX, which is serviceable, but feels a little low-effort. Fortunately, the game files are all there, so it's not difficult at all to find a source port to suit one's tastes.			",222,58,3,17,12,1,14

I can't say its for everyone, but for nostalgia, it certainly takes me back to the 90's and In case its not good enough for the 2000's kids with it not having enough graphics, blood, and gore, Brutal Doom helps. ;)Still those pixeled monsters from a distance. :D			",25,1,0,2,3,0,1

												I don't nean to sound rude but this was bad... I mean, it gets to the title screen like it should then freezes. If you read my last review before this please forget it. I recently found a way to play it after a bit by pressing alt+enter to exit fullscreen in the boot menu. It will play after it's on the small screen. I pushed the alt+enter after playing it a bit and i got full screen. I am glad to see this game here though and glad I got it to work. Play now for nostalgia or a good classic!			",83,16,0,3,4,2,1

												DOOM II will NEVER stop being my favorite game ever. Never.I love everything about it, from melancholic yet energetic music, psychodelic style, grotesquily creepy 2D demons, insane pace, deeply satisfying multiplayer, mapping community, unbalanced yet so delicious weapons, to every single bug which was prefected by players and mappers into becoming a feature, SKYMAYBE.WAD and impse.Sweet, sweet impse.And for people whining it doesn't work: grab a source port. On Steam, you're buying the game's content. Yeah, I guess Steam should care about whether the product they give you works or not as it is, but, come on. Some tiny amounts of googling doesn't hurt. (If you want a brief explanation: you grab doom2.wad from game's folder, copy it to folder of source port you downloaded, done. Most popular ports: Chocolate Doom and prBoom for the classic feel, ZDoom for single player/mods, Zandronum, Zdaemon and Odamex for multiplayer (though you can play single player on them as well))			",46,23,0,8,11,0,2

												The one that started it all. The second one!Recommended: BRUTAL DOOM-Mod! With this installed DOOM 1 & 2 easily wipes the floor with all these call-of-cover-based-quick-time-event-trashcans out there! STILL unmatched! EVERYTHING fits perfectly into the delightful gameplay: Fast movement-speed, the weaponry has some PUNCH in it, adrenaline-pumping gameplay and the MOD adds even more to the supreme Guru of all shooters!- Enemies are more aggressive- thousand new animations- Finishing moves- better visuals (oh the eye-candy!)explosions are definitely more devastatingthe minigun feels and sounds finally powerfull and dangerous!- gibs and gore everywhere- enemies, gibs, decals, guts, bulletholes and ammo-casings stay in the map. lying scattered around.WHAT modern game does have this today?Not one comes in my mind!- tear the hellspawns a new A*hole together withs some friends in COOP!!!-better Sound-design-a very active mod-community!Still unmatched, still playing the hell out of it. And with new content and mega-huge-maps and level-packs (wads) there is no reason for me to play all of these bad ported console-casual-""games"".After playing Doom 1 & 2 with BRUTAL DOOM, all these ""modern"" casualized Quick-TIme-event-coverbased ""Shooters"" can take a nap and suck on their thumb!

												It's DOOM. Do I say more? This game made every kid pre-ejaculate when it came out, and it still holds up pretty well. It is one of the grandpapa's of shooters and the inspiration for a lot of our favorites games today. Nothing beats the classics, and the fact that it is more fun than a lot of modern first person shooters says a lot about this game. Controls may be a bit weird for people who really haven't experimented much with archaic shooters, but you'll get used to it in times. It is an experience that no one should miss and it will run on any computer from 2001 and beyond. 10/10			",90,4,0,12,3,2,6

It created a new genre, it created FPS.In this game, you're playing as a brave nameless soldier. Brave, because you don't hesitate to go in hell to save the Earth. Nameless, because nobody else is here to call you by your name.You are alone. Alone versus thousands of monsters, aliens, demons, cannibals possessed ex-soldiers.In this game, you'll never use your mouse. Don't think it's easy, you'll have to aim carefully, but quickly if you want to live.In this game, when an enemy is killed, it just don't fall on the ground flatly. No. Instead of that, it's torn into pieces, it's skinned alive, or it disappears on a giant explosion, while screaming in pain.In this game, you'll fight for your life, but also for your soul. You'll leave countless bloody corpses behind you, still moving forward. And if you have enough, there are mods.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Steam obviously won't show how many hours I have played since I've owned DooM II since well before Steam was a twinkle in Gaben's eye and it also doesn't keep track of non-Steam versions of the engine. I have been playing Brutal DooM on the gzdoom engine and it is a crazy good time. Get your DooM/Hexen/Heretic game files on a Steam sale and then grab an after-market game engine.

It's still worth playing now today, and even for $5, you are absolutely getting your moneys worth.That said, you may want to look for source ports or WADS for Doom 1 and 2, because you'll have a bit of trouble trying to get Doom 1 and 2 to run or play properly on Windows 7 and 8, at least from my expirence. Still it doesn't take that long to install and get working, so get it anyway. It's a must for any Steam Owner.			",192,14,3,10,9,0,16

												Perhaps the greatest game of all time, and quite likely my personal favourite. Diabolical design and art, and the levels are tricky and deadly. A fast-paced shooter that refines the glorious mechanics of the original. The addition of a single new weapon and a few new enemies adds diversity and demands new strategies. The heavy metal soundtrack punctuates the experience perfectly, amplifying the intensity.A timeless game that will evoke strong feelings of exhiliration, dread, and triumph. The perfect game.

												DOOM II was the first DOOM game I played back when I was a teenager.  Back in those days, I spent hours trying to free enough base memory (DOS only gave you 640K) to play games like this.  After getting it running, the frame rate was really choppy and only playable in a reduced size window.  I remember seeing it on a 486 and being wow-ed seeing it run at full screen.  I also remember the first time seeing a chainsaw used as a weapon, which was really unheard of back in those days (Mortal Kombat had not hit the arcades yet).So how does DOOM II hold up after all these years?  I will admit, when I started it up, it looked down right ugly running at full screen.  No joystick compatibility was a bummer as well.  I seem to remember my Gravis gamepad working on the original DOOM II back in the day, which I bought a Creative Labs Sound Blaster card specifically for the joystick port.  The level design seems to hold up well, and I still remembered many of the secret rooms.  I actually jumped a little when an imp popped out behind a hidden door, which I had forgotten about after all of these years.To be honest, I had more fun playing this classic than playing any of the current FPS games.  You press enter, pick a difficulty, and you are playing.  In games these days, you have to sit through minutes and minutes of boring dialogue and cutscenes before you can do anything.  That why I always try to put players in the action as soon as possible in the games that I develop.			",330,72,6,47,24,0,57

												Of course I love doom. I played the freeware version over and over because I couldnt afford it when I was just a wee lad. I still love it. Five bucks for a classic game like this... how the hell can you resist? My ONLY issue is its stretched a bit on a 1600x900 screen. Which has nothing to do with the game itself since it was desgined for crt monitors that where make 800x600. Oh and the forward and reverse thrusting action on the mouse...

I pushed the alt+enter after playing it a bit and i got full screen. I am glad to see this game here though and glad I got it to work. Play now for nostalgia or a good classic!			",83,16,0,3,4,2,1

												It's DOOM. Do I say more? This game made every kid pre-ejaculate when it came out, and it still holds up pretty well. It is one of the grandpapa's of shooters and the inspiration for a lot of our favorites games today. Nothing beats the classics, and the fact that it is more fun than a lot of modern first person shooters says a lot about this game. Controls may be a bit weird for people who really haven't experimented much with archaic shooters, but you'll get used to it in times. It is an experience that no one should miss and it will run on any computer from 2001 and beyond. 10/10			",90,4,0,12,3,2,6

												DOOM II will NEVER stop being my favorite game ever. Never.I love everything about it, from melancholic yet energetic music, psychodelic style, grotesquily creepy 2D demons, insane pace, deeply satisfying multiplayer, mapping community, unbalanced yet so delicious weapons, to every single bug which was prefected by players and mappers into becoming a feature, SKYMAYBE.WAD and impse.Sweet, sweet impse.And for people whining it doesn't work: grab a source port. On Steam, you're buying the game's content. Yeah, I guess Steam should care about whether the product they give you works or not as it is, but, come on. Some tiny amounts of googling doesn't hurt. (If you want a brief explanation: you grab doom2.wad from game's folder, copy it to folder of source port you downloaded, done. Most popular ports: Chocolate Doom and prBoom for the classic feel, ZDoom for single player/mods, Zandronum, Zdaemon and Odamex for multiplayer (though you can play single player on them as well))			",46,23,0,8,11,0,2

												Perhaps the greatest game of all time, and quite likely my personal favourite. Diabolical design and art, and the levels are tricky and deadly. A fast-paced shooter that refines the glorious mechanics of the original. The addition of a single new weapon and a few new enemies adds diversity and demands new strategies. The heavy metal soundtrack punctuates the experience perfectly, amplifying the intensity.A timeless game that will evoke strong feelings of exhiliration, dread, and triumph. The perfect game.

There are others laying around... but be warned: Some are♥♥♥♥♥♥ Some are just the same levels, same weapons, and same monsters; or what i just said with different textures and sounds for everything, except they are still, in fact, the same levels, same weapons, and same mosters.BEFORE I GO CRAZY: The mods that do have new features really made DOOM II a great game.

												At one point DOOM outsold windows. There's a reason for that. If somehow you missed out on DOOM you need to try it. Many FPS games released now pale in comparison to this timeless classic. If you've already played it you should try revisiting good ol' Phobos and Deimos with the mindblowing Brutal Doom Mod.Steam has the game run through a DOS box by default which brings the graphics way back to the point that it's honestly kind of hard to play for more than a few minutes at a time. I'd highly suggest running the game through a source port like GZDoom. If you're having trouble getting the many available mods or source ports to work there are plenty of tutorials online that can help you get them running.			",164,24,0,15,4,1,18

From a bygone age when FPSs were filled with monsters and run 'n' gun action, this is a game with but one rule: Kill or Be Killed. Easy to pick up and play, yet can keep its value for years after being beaten, with many secrets and difficulty levels so that you always have something to come back to. I should know; I started playing this game when I was 8!			",255,45,4,25,12,3,34

												Ah, Doom, Doom, Doom. What is there to say that hasent been said already? Its a fantastic sequel to its original, keeping the same engine and adding new content and new challenge, with many more levels, but a sad lack of secret levels. When most people think of the doom franchise, this is the one where they turn their attention to, in my opinion the best of the originals, untill Doom 3D botched it up. (thanks 3d realms.) I aswell think that this is the game where the doom series reached its peek, with clever level design, an interesting final boss, a new weapon, and many new enemies and powerups. If you want to see where the FPS genre began, start here, its worth every cent. Also, dont let my 0.4 hours fool you. I have well over 300+ hours using a seprate engine calle (G)Zdoom, which makes the game more streamlined and easier to play.			",135,10,0,23,6,2,13

Just do a search on Google for Realm667 and enjoy the mods. There are others laying around... but be warned: Some are♥♥♥♥♥♥ Some are just the same levels, same weapons, and same monsters; or what i just said with different textures and sounds for everything, except they are still, in fact, the same levels, same weapons, and same mosters.BEFORE I GO CRAZY: The mods that do have new features really made DOOM II a great game. The most recent one I have played is Legacy of Suffering. So go try it, ♥♥♥♥♥-reader.Oooo burn.			",312,29,2,16,5,0,6

												DOOM II, the grandfather of the modern FPS, is one of the finest games ever made... for its time, at least. While the game has absolutely aged over the last nearly 20 years, it is still an absolute blast to play. Before the days of linear, cinematic FPSes, the genre was fast-paced, pitting players in maze-like environment, forcing them to look for keys and buttons to open doors to unlock the exit before they met their demise. Weapons were awesome and unique, and the monsters were absolutely amazing. Every last monster was built out of clay and are turned into sprites, so the game looks a bit like a demented Robot Chicken skit. However, in the days of Windows 8 and whatnot, the game no longer works without a bit of setup. Luckily, there are guides on how to set up and configure everything so you can run the game on your new machines. The controls can feel a bit slippery, but overall the ultimate FPS still holds up today in all of its glory. If you are willing to drop a few dollars to experience history, then DOOM, or more specifically DOOM II, will be your gateway into the underworld.			",98,8,0,8,18,2,5

												A true classic of the FPS genre and quite possibly one of the best white-knuckle, fast-paced action games ever made. If you like your demon-hunting bloody and lighting quick, look to no other game; although I should mention the game is two decades old and counting. The graphics are certaintly nothing to scream about. However, they don't impede the frame rate which is always brisk for the quick actions needed to survive the hellish landscape. If you've played and beaten the first game this is just like it gameplay-wise except with larger levels, new weapons, and enemies. I'd recommend playing it on the second-to-last difficult level for the ultimate challenge. No other games quite compare to the feeling of being chased by a bunch of imps and thinking you are opening a door to a respite only to spring forth a trap of chaingun dudes ripping your flesh apart. **** (STARS) out of **** (STARS)			",58,13,0,1,7,0,11

Truly, if DOOM got you excited then this will give you an awesome induced heart attack!Excellent music, challenging levels, great gameplay. What more could you ask for?Pick up DOOM classic complete and get DOOM, DOOM II, Final DOOM and the Master levels for practicly nothing! Want a cheap game that gives you hours of entertainment?

Just when you thought your doom experience was over you just download fanmade WAD's and get them running and BAM! If that isn't enough then I highly suggest you get the Brutal DOOM mod!

												I know what you're thinking.""It's old, it's ugly, it's hard, and I have to use an emulator to play it.""But think about it. This game is a classic. It created a new genre, it created FPS.In this game, you're playing as a brave nameless soldier. Brave, because you don't hesitate to go in hell to save the Earth. Nameless, because nobody else is here to call you by your name.You are alone. Alone versus thousands of monsters, aliens, demons, cannibals possessed ex-soldiers.In this game, you'll never use your mouse. Don't think it's easy, you'll have to aim carefully, but quickly if you want to live.In this game, when an enemy is killed, it just don't fall on the ground flatly. No. Instead of that, it's torn into pieces, it's skinned alive, or it disappears on a giant explosion, while screaming in pain.In this game, you'll fight for your life, but also for your soul. You'll leave countless bloody corpses behind you, still moving forward. And if you have enough, there are mods.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 Doom II is indeed, my favorite game of all time. Everything that was great about Doom I, but multiplied times-ten. Doom II: Hell on Earth offers a lot more enemies, more maps, another weapon, and larger, more enjoyable maps. This game is absolutely flawless and in my opinion better than Doom I, if you are a fan of classic Doom you have to buy this game or you will be missing out, A LOT. Just make sure that you go ahead and grab a source port like Zdoom or Zandronium because the steam version does not let you configure any settings so you can only play with OPL Synthesiser music and you can't bind any keys.

												DOOM II is without a doubt one of the best games of all time. Imploving in almost every way from the original, DOOM II introduces more enemies, more game elements, more levels, and a new weapon. The level design can be hit or miss, and the lack of the chapter system means that to get to a certain level, you will need to play through the whole game unless you have a save. Even though DOOM II suffers from a few problems, it is a classic and extremely fun to go back and play.			",115,8,0,9,6,0,2

												DOOM II was the first DOOM game I played back when I was a teenager.  Back in those days, I spent hours trying to free enough base memory (DOS only gave you 640K) to play games like this.  After getting it running, the frame rate was really choppy and only playable in a reduced size window.  I remember seeing it on a 486 and being wow-ed seeing it run at full screen.  I also remember the first time seeing a chainsaw used as a weapon, which was really unheard of back in those days (Mortal Kombat had not hit the arcades yet).So how does DOOM II hold up after all these years?  I will admit, when I started it up, it looked down right ugly running at full screen.  No joystick compatibility was a bummer as well.  I seem to remember my Gravis gamepad working on the original DOOM II back in the day, which I bought a Creative Labs Sound Blaster card specifically for the joystick port.  The level design seems to hold up well, and I still remembered many of the secret rooms.  I actually jumped a little when an imp popped out behind a hidden door, which I had forgotten about after all of these years.To be honest, I had more fun playing this classic than playing any of the current FPS games.  You press enter, pick a difficulty, and you are playing.  In games these days, you have to sit through minutes and minutes of boring dialogue and cutscenes before you can do anything.  That why I always try to put players in the action as soon as possible in the games that I develop.			",330,72,6,47,24,0,57

On top of all that it has the largest library of mods ever seen and a modding community that is still finding new innovative ways to push the engine to it's limits.Definitely would recommend to anyone who doesn't already have it.I would suggest using a sourceport like Zandronum or GZDoom			",225,20,6,25,9,1,5

												Doom 2, the sequel to Doom, holds its own quite well and makes some good improvements from the first installment in the series. At first glance the sequel to Doom looks identical to its predecessor with the same graphics style, HUD, enemies ect take a closer look and it will show that there are a few new changes. One of its biggest improvements was adding new enemies to the roster, each of which is challenging to face in its own way. The game has a runtime of 30 levels and almost feels longer than the original Doom possible because the game is whole and not split into episodes. This can hurt it however as some parts of the game seem to drag on as you wonder how close you really are to the finish line. There is one new weapon in Doom 2 and it is the super shotgun, and it lives up to its name as it obliterates enemies in your path. The inclusion of more than just one weapon would have helped increase the appeal however. The levels in the campaign are once again a mix of fun and very confusing, but with modern technology a guide is only a few clicks away. Overall Doom 2 feels somewhat like an addon for the original Doom but does show a few new tricks while still keeping the old ones.			",66,6,0,5,4,1,5

												The original Doom revolutionized video games forever. Doom II is, comparatively, a much smaller deal. At a glance. However, it's additions provided critical tools for the modding community: the greatest weapon in any video game ever, the Super Shotgun. An expanded bestiary featuring horrific creatures like the Arch-Vile. Plus, a bunch of engine improvements and new textures. Since 1994, modders would use these new resources to create the single largest mod libraries for any game ever. Doom II is the closest to a truly endless game that anyone could fathom; there exist over two decades of high quality map packs and mods, and new content continues to be produced for Doom II on a daily basis.Doom II is one of the greatest games of all time.

Who needs cover anyway when you have an arsenal of varied guns and more speed than you could possibly need? Just get up close and personal and show 'em how personal your Super Shotgun is. This is DOOM after all.And if that isn't enough, there's a huge and awesome community behind the game with a ton of custom map packs of great quality that only further extend the life of the game. Add to that the many source ports that come with severl QoL changes  and other mods like Brutal Doom and you got yourself a classic that won't go away anytime soon.			",243,46,2,34,24,0,19

												Doom 2. What a classic. I remember playing this on Win95 at age 7 with a bunch of friends of mine from school. Anyways, anyone wanting to look what its like to play an early 90's game with fluid gameplay and intense action, look no further. This game is one of a kind. For best experience, play on Ultra Violence. I believe its meant to be played that way.BONUS: Get a sourceport like Zdoom or GZdoom from zdoom.org if you want mouse look, crouching, and jumping since they're not present in Doom's original form. Plus, doomers have created their own custom levels, monsters, sound and special effects for everyone to try. They are called WADs i think.			",12,0,0,4,0,0,2

												The original Doom revolutionized video games forever. Doom II is, comparatively, a much smaller deal. At a glance. However, it's additions provided critical tools for the modding community: the greatest weapon in any video game ever, the Super Shotgun. An expanded bestiary featuring horrific creatures like the Arch-Vile. Plus, a bunch of engine improvements and new textures. Since 1994, modders would use these new resources to create the single largest mod libraries for any game ever. Doom II is the closest to a truly endless game that anyone could fathom; there exist over two decades of high quality map packs and mods, and new content continues to be produced for Doom II on a daily basis.Doom II is one of the greatest games of all time.

												Doom 2, the sequel to Doom, holds its own quite well and makes some good improvements from the first installment in the series. At first glance the sequel to Doom looks identical to its predecessor with the same graphics style, HUD, enemies ect take a closer look and it will show that there are a few new changes. One of its biggest improvements was adding new enemies to the roster, each of which is challenging to face in its own way. The game has a runtime of 30 levels and almost feels longer than the original Doom possible because the game is whole and not split into episodes. This can hurt it however as some parts of the game seem to drag on as you wonder how close you really are to the finish line. There is one new weapon in Doom 2 and it is the super shotgun, and it lives up to its name as it obliterates enemies in your path. The inclusion of more than just one weapon would have helped increase the appeal however. The levels in the campaign are once again a mix of fun and very confusing, but with modern technology a guide is only a few clicks away. Overall Doom 2 feels somewhat like an addon for the original Doom but does show a few new tricks while still keeping the old ones.			",66,6,0,5,4,1,5

												What is there to say about Doom II that hasn't already been said?I'm not entirely sure myself, but let's start off slow and easy.Doom I and II will always be the best of the doom games, as they were the originals. Compared to the new Doom, it will be infinitely superior to some, but not all.Doom II was for a different generation, a generation that valued patience and effort. Lets put it this way, imagine playing the new doom with only the arrow keys, the spacebar, and a couple other keys.Sound good? Yeah, I don't like it either, thats because there was originally no mouselook. Which means tank controls.This was for a generation that took it's time to finish the amazing levels this game contained, because they were forced to. They found satisfaction in the subtle fact that they had finally beaten that one map where monster closets open up on both sides, and you cant turn fast enough to fight both left and right, so they backtracked and funneled them through a hallway. It took strategy to beat this game, something the new Doom lacks entirely. Doom 2016 is about instant gratification, and that leaves no room for the feeling of accomplishment. What do you get? A nice first person animation of you brutally slamming an Imp's face into a wall, not to mention it goes by so quickly.In the end, it's up to bethesda and ID software to determine how the games they make play and feel.But I'm saddened that they encouraged the ideal of instant satisfaction over rinse and repeat strategy.

												The best way to enjoy this game is with a source port like Zandronum or GZdoom.After you get those you can play the game through with some modern upgrades.Then you also get to play 20+ years of high quality mods. worth the 10$ it costs and much MUCH more.Edit: modifying this review for the steam awards. I nominated this game for a proposed category for ""best modding community"", because I beleive that some of the best games I have ever played are mods for this game. The mapping community for this game is also extremely friendly, and there have been many community projects geared towards teaching new people how to make levels for a game that's old enough to order a beer. This game has spawned some truly unique experiences through its mod community (Not just Brutal Doom); that's why I beleive it has one of the best and longest-lasting mod communities, not just on steam but in gaming in general.

												an even better game that the first game that game out. So many enemies from every room and you got to find a way out of each level witch can be confussing sometimes. On higher difficulty the amount of enemies can be rediculous. This game is a classic shooting game everyone should play at least once it is worth every penny spent just pick up the entire doom pack for that matter you will not be disapointed.You can even use internet doom explorer to play multiplayer on witch is what i do.

												Came for the sequel, stayed for the Super Shotgun.PROS:It's DOOM II.CONS:GET OUT.Buy this to get the .WAD file for DOOM II, then run it through whatever exterior engine you want. I use Zandronum, and occasionally others. The Steam edition comes with DOSBox, a very good emulator for the MS:DOS, however it can take a while to adjust and get controls configured (unless you like moving/strafing with your mouse and looking with the arrow keys), and since its a DOS emulator, it's got poor resolution and is fairly clunky. The Doom community offers far superior alternatives, with Zdoom letting you change everything from text size and color to the freaking midi device running. DOOM and DOOM II are the best shooters ever made, and will remain the best for a very, VERY long time.			",133,16,0,10,10,1,2

												It says I have only almost 20 minutes played for Doom 2, but trust me, I put in MANY hours but didn't have those hours tracked since I play it using GZDoom (a source-port that's much better than DOS-Box).If you wanna shoot demons in the face all old-school like, this is for you. Wanna spice it up a bit? Download mods like Brutal Doom, DemonSteele, or Aliens TC. Or even improve some animations with Beautiful Doom. The sky (and engine/source-port) is the limit when it comes to modding potential!Doom 2's cheap, has plenty of mod support, and also comes with the bonus Master Levels. And, well, it's Doom XD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(please excuse low playtime, I use a custom nonsteam launcher to manage mods and engines) Aging almost perfectly doom II is worth buying and playing to this day. The game has been kept alive by the most dedicated and productive fanbase I've ever seen making the shooter have the longest lifespan out of any game with decades of content to be played through. Pick it up on sale or buy it at full price but the legendary shooter that revamped the genre is a must buy! Just remember to get a custom launcher such as ZDL with GZDOOM installed as modern systems do not easily work with DOS anymore too well. This is far easier to do than it sounds and does not affect gameplay too much unless the player wants to modify the game's incredibly lenient coding.			",232,28,1,28,24,3,34

												This is probably the first time I've ever seen a game sequel be just as competent as it's predecessor, without really raising or lowering the bar.I like DOOM. I like it a lot. And with all the hype behind the new DOOM 2016, I just couldn't help myself but throw some more hours into beating its sequel: Hell on Earth. Because DOOM 2016 would beat my poor little laptop to death.DOOM II takes place right after DOOM I, where Doomguy gets back from Mars to see earth covered with demons, and decides to take care of the problem the same way he did previously- by killing every demon that stands in his way. Like Carmack said, the story in games aren't important. While I may disagree with that statement, I do agree that an action-based should focus more on keeping you in the action as much as it can. And DOOM I and II both succeed in that, in my opinion.With making a sequel, there's often the question of what will be added on to the new entry. With DOOM II there is a wide variety of new levels that are much more intuitively-designed than the first game, along with a new onslaught of enemies to face, including one of my least favorite enemies ever: The Pain Elementals. F*** those guys. Seriously. F*** those guys.Surprisingly, as far as new content goes, besides the new enemies and levels, all you're given for new weapons is the super shotgun, which quickly became my favorite weapon. It uses two shotgun shells per round, and does extra damage as opposed to the standard shotgun. The game is challenging with all this new stuff, and I found myself in the DOOM-daze, where all I can think about over the week is playing more DOOM and getting more and more sucked in with every playthrough. This is a very addicting game, but one flaw I saw throughout it (besides the lack of story) would be how the game really feels like an expansion to the original DOOM. It may have the run-time of a full game, but the textures, mixtures of old enemies with the new ones, and same arsenal as the first game, makes the game feel like more of DOOM I. I personally believe a game should accel from the foundation of the first game, but whether you disagree or agree with me is entirely your choice.I won't deny that I love this game still. Just as much as the first DOOM. It's fast-paced, looks great, sounds great, and is addicting from start to finish. But since a lot of it does feel like the first game just bleeding into a sequel, I'm giving it the exact same score I'd give DOOM. A 7/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Legend, only bigger, badder, meaner. The super shotgun is a blast (see what I did here), unspeakable new horrors are out for your blood, level design and music are even awesomer. Like wine, it just gets better with age. Time travel to before microtransactions, broken game releases and DLC, focus on perfect fun, skill and, of course, Hell.Play with ""gzdoom"" for better graphics and controls. That's why I have few hours on record. I spent half my youth on this game, a landmark of PC gaming no self-respecting player should miss.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
