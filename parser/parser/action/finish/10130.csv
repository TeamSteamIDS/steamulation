												While I find the still $19.99 price tag a bit much for a 7 year old game I still found this very enjoyable.The game is very much like the Half Life series as it blends puzzles in with action and genuinely tried something innovative with the time control mechanics which work very well. The graphics are pretty good although the environments cna look very bland. Lots of flat textures and the colors are mostly grey. The story itself is very much like Half Life 2 as there is a dystopian future (or past as it is in this game) that is ruled over by a tyrant who loves to talk about himself over large jumbo trons. The voice acting isn't bad but it's nothing to write home about. It doesn't get in the way but there's never a moment where I went ""Oh wow what a great line!""The weapons are all varied and pretty damn fun to use. The action in the game really feels like one of those games nowadays that tries to capture that ""old-school"" shooter vibe and yet the game just plays it straight intead of trying to shove it down my throat. When I slow down time then unload both barrels of my shotgun on a guy and I watch as his ragdoll flies backward while still in slow motion as his blood splatters on my screen I know it was badass I don't need a game (or game's character) to TELL me I'm badass.This is the only purely action time manipulation game I can think of other than maybe Singularity although it's not really the same manipulation. Not many games allow me to reverse time and walk past the guys who just kicked the door down in front of me and unkick the door down in reverse time so that when I bring time back I was behind them the whole time with shotgun aimed squarely at their backs.Is it the best game ever? No. It's weak story and bland environments really bring the game down and you'll find yourself not caring about any of the stories or characters and Dr. Krone does not make for a good villian especially when you barely here him speak other than on some jumbo trons while loud gunfire is happening. To bring up Half Life again, Dr. Breen was such a good villian because his face was everywhere constantly preaching the combine's message as he has sold out humainty so that he can live in comfort. Behind all of his messages and threats he is just a coward sitting up in a tower. You really get to hate the guy. Dr. Krone is just evil scientist number 7 that wants to rule the world becasue...EVIL.If you are looking for an action packed old school style shooting game however this is the game for you. How many games let you pause time, take an enemy's weapon, stick said enemy with a grenade, then use his gun to headshot his buddy he was talking to? Tell me please because if there was I'd be playing that game too. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game is one of those that just flies under the radar.  its really cool and worth multiple playthroughs.  there are three time powers you can use:reverse time: you wont use this much besides a couple of plot puzzles. the only real use for it in combat is when you get hit with a sticky grenade. it'll send it back and give you a brief window to avoid getting hit again.stop time: this one is also used in a number of puzzles but its actually useful in combat.  you can stop time and get easy headshots or you could use it to stop enemy fire and recover your health. of course because its so overpowered it doesnt last very long.slow time: this one is by far the best.  it lasts the longest too.  you move at normal speed but everyone else is really slow.  its a lot of fun running around getting headshots on everyone. overall a great game. i definitely recommend it.  of course with all the other games available you should probably wait for one of the big seasonal sales to buy it.

												Timeshift is an amazing game and also an underrated one. I've played this game back to 2008 and when i saw it on steam and was on sale, I immediately got this game in my collection.The most innovative thing in this game might be the control of time. Games includes bullet time is increasingly common since Max Payne, but this game has something special- not only slow, but also pause and reverse time, both in defeat your enemy and solve the puzzle. The puzzles are pretty fun- some of them are smart you actually need to think for a minute- but not too difficult that's the fun part of the game.I'm have way through the game now, for the skilled level and I got the cross-bow. This weapon is what I'm clawing for from the beginning of the game since it's so powerful that it kills everyone one site within one shot- Having this weapon in hands actually immediately lowers the difficulty of game, but the good thing is you have some advanced enemy- some have part your ability like moving fast, to balance the game.For a 2007 game like this, I played on Win8 and didn't have any running issues which is good. I used to have some graphic issues on my Win7 computer but for my win8 laptop, even there was a window pop up right before I run the game says beware of the comparability, it seems everything goes in order. I have a very pleasant experience with this game and I intend to finish this game during the weekends.9/10. I could be picky but 1 for some of the contents are repeated-  not too much I still enjoyed playing. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Timeshift is one of those games that was mostly overlooked and forgotten, and it's a shame because it's actually a pretty neat game. It gives you the power to rewind, pause, or slow down time, and while you can just play the game by slowing time, shooting everyone to death, and then moving on to the next fight and doing the same thing, it's pretty boring that way, and the game gives you room to be somewhat creative with the powers instead. You can freeze time and grab enemies' guns out of their hands, and they'll either try to maneuver to a nearby gun if it's on the ground or just surrender to you. If someone throws a grenade at you, you can rewind time until it's back in their hands and shoot their arm, causing them to drop it at their feet. Most of the weapons feel satisfying to use (the assault rifle is the main exception, since it's pretty weak against most enemies and is only really good for the grenade launcher secondary fire), and most of them have unique secondary features like flamethrowers or laser cannons. The game uses a 3 weapon limit system, which isn't really ideal, but at least gives you the opportunity to have a close range weapon, a long range weapon, and a fun weapon, instead of just being limited to the standard shotgun/assault rifle combo that most games with two weapon systems force you into. It slows down a bit near the end and has a few levels that feel like padding that don't give you as much of an opportunity to appreciate the time powers, but otherwise it's a generally fun if somewhat basic shooter campaign. I wouldn't say it's worth immediately going out and buying for $20, and since it's an Activision game you can pretty much bet on it not dropping except for the occasional Activision sale, but when that sale does come around and Timeshift drops down to $5 again I'd pretty easily recommend it. It's worth mentioning that the Steam version of the game is 1.0 and it lacks the 1.2 patch, so if the game doesn't work for you (It worked fine for me, but maybe I was just lucky) you may need to follow one of the guides on Steam on how to install the 1.2 patch.

												Much like the time manipulation gameplay it's based on, Timeshift is a window into time. A time when games had to try and be as familiar as possible, but still contain a gimmick to attract any sort of audience.Superfically the gunplay of Timeshift is very reminisicent of F.E.A.R, Timesplitters Future Perfect and Star Wars Republic Commando. The art style is painfully reminiscient of Gears of War. And the timeshifting gameplay itself is taken straight from Prince of Persia: The Sands of TIme.Something you may have noticed is all of these games released years prior to Timeshift. As dated as Timeshift is right now, it was dated even when it came out. The game is painfully linear, the art style is very generic and colorless, the storyline is laughably generic and sounds like half a dozen other shooters and the time shifting gameplay feels too much like a gimmick. I end up just not using it at all because it makes the game too easy even on the hardest difficulty.But I still recommend this game for people who like first person shooters. The game is still surprisingly competant, and its multiplayer was a halfway decent attempt at mimicing Timesplitters Future Perfect. But you have to go into it knowing that it's very generic and unimpressive. It does a good job at being a clone. Much like the time manipulation gameplay it's based on, Timeshift is stuck in the past and never moved on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a pretty solid FPS with some unique time shifting mechanics. Basically you have the ability to... as the name implies shift time. You can slow it down, stop it or reverse it, which could make for some interesting combat situations, but unfortunately that's not the case here, because mostly you'll just find yourself slowing down time in order to mow down groups of enemies with some ridiculously OP weapon, which is completely fine and I found enjoyable since you get to feel like greek god. There's a just a certain type of satisfaction to be had when your targets freak out and yell ""THATS IMPOSSIBLE!"" before getting blown apart into pieces by a timed explosive arrow. Where this game does put the full extent of your time shifting abilities to use is puzzle solving, I found the puzzles to be a little simple and repetitive but still interesting and clever, sometimes I'd stop to think how cool it was what I just did. The story was mildly interesting, without spoiling too much you basically get sent back in time to take care of a renegade scientist who went back in time to take over the world, but due to how time travel works your time line doesn't get affected and you're actually just saving an alternate timeline... or something, I don't know, probably not but that's what I got from it. Time travel is complicated as ♥♥♥♥ so don't expect me to explain it ok? Anyway where this game TRULY shines is in it's art & graphics direction, it's got a really awesome mix between cyber and steampunk going on set in a nazi germany type aesthetic, it made me want to keep playing to see more of this world.So in conclusion I wouldn't call this game underrated as steam tags suggest, its rather a more obscure title set in a cool♥♥♥♥♥world where you get to feel like a god. Definitely worth a playthrough if you enjoy FPS. I'd give this game about a 7/Bioshock.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The great game that most of people passed by. Sadly.One of the most underrated games, along with Singularity, that didn't find much popularity which it really deserves.Fast-paced variety action with some traditional(but sexy) and exotic weapons  plus tons of ""fat"" Insolent enemies i.e. oldschool difficulty even on medium plus time-controlling mechanics that works really cool and badass. There're even vehicle and airship levels.From cons I can pick out the great scripting of the entire game and overall corridor gameplay. Also imo background music kinda sucks.Well It's like F.E.A.R., but with more enemies, Half-Life like puzzles, more time-changing abilities, more fun and a lack of horror effect of course.

												A good game that was overlooked on release (indeed I myself didn't bother with it). Above all it is FUN. I'd describe it almost like HL2 with much better shooting/weapon design and less bloat. Indeed they even use the same physics engine (Havok) common to many games e.g. F.E.A.R.It isn't hard to see why many would write it off as the first two hours or so are rather meh.  Average weapons/shooting (though each gun does have a secondary fire that normally does something fun), bullet spongy generic enemies, so-so level design and the time powers seem like nothing more than a gimmick.Then it improves. More open levels, interesting level design instead of bland urban areas and you get the first fun weapon (an explosive-bolt firing crossbow). The enemy designs start to vary too from stand and shoot to jetpacks and energy shields. Time powers become important (you're never far from death) and the setting changes from generic dystopia to FUN sort-of future. It's perhaps best described as similar in style to an 80s or 90s cartoon with its mixture of a serious story and rule-of-cool setting.  Never does it get too silly or too serious, however.From this point onwards the game just gets steadily better and better until it ends adding more fun weapons, enemies and levels not to mention some vehicle sections (honestly I didn't realise how much I missed them in modern games). Sure it's a little short and another 2-3 hours would have been nice but it leaves you wanting more which is preferable to a game so full of filler you're happy to finish. Again it compares favourably to HL2 which dragged on far too long. The ending levels are, again, in the more boring urban area but it's nice to revisit them seeing the changes you've made with your time travel.Story isn't amazing but functional and doesn't have any major flaws. It does make some use of the time travel concept but believe me this isn't the type of game you buy for the story. There are also some puzzles that are slightly unintuitive but you aren't likely to have any major problems and if you do google is always available.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can call it Activion Half-life if you like.the unique mechanics are Time Minipulation, slow, stop and reverse time.Graphics looks amazing even for a 2007 game, the atmosphere and the main color of the game is gray mostly.it took me 16-19 hours to finish the game, feels perfect for it, not that long, not too short.just be sure that your PC runs the game before buying it. It's so worth playing if you like good shooters with unique mechanics.----------------------if you got the game up and running, rebind ""X"" to ""left Shift"", rebind time manipulation functions to other keys as well, if you are using keyboard			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game I can't really explain on a basic level, save for a few bits. It's pretty obvious this game takes a lot of inspiration from Half-Life 2 in environments and story. Lots of crawl spaces, various puzzles, driving levels, etc. The only detail I took a lot of notice at was the urban environments look very similar to what HL2 was originally planned to be, as there's quite a bit of Art Deco and weather similar to Viktor Antonov's concept art.On another note, the lighting and character models, including gibbing resemble Doom 3 a little too much. I almost felt like I was playing it at some points. I also hate the rebel leader, how he emphasizes certain points of his phrases, and how most dialogue with him involves me doing grunt work. He does say thank you though, so I guess he isn't all that bad.Gameplay-wise, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing hard. I'm not even kidding, the AI is designed to kill you very fast like real soldiers if you don't take advantage of time manipulation. It will happen, don't even try to fight soldiers without doing it. The total time of the entire campaign is about 8.5 hours, which is short for single-player. That's probably just me though, I tend to go through SP games very fast.The GameSpy shutdown made this game's multiplayer defunct. I doubt there's even a patch out there, and the devs have long-since abandoned the game. It's main downfall points is most likely its lack of a community and/or mod support.If you want to get this game, get it on sale or if you don't care about sales, that's okay. It's worth it.

												Fun game to speedrun.Since I have destroyed the story and level design with hundreds of hours of exploiting the game for me at least, I can't really represent a normal opinion.But I still think this is an underrated fun game, where you have abilities to outsmart your enemies, similar to Crysis.Unfortunately I don't think the multiplayer support or community is still there, and you also have to patch the game manually via steam community guide and hope your drivers still launch the game, but once it works it is a fun singleplayer playthrough.It was designed to be the first successful game to a new series, but it was just released in the wrong point in time. Valve's Orange Box, Beautiful Katamari, Tomb Raider Anniversary, Guitar Hero 3, The Witcher 1 and Cod Modern Warfare were released at approximately the same time, so most people didn't notice this game, sadly.

												Basically, timeshift is like F.E.A.R, but better. More guns, more gore-tastic ways to kill people, TONS of slow-mo. But timeshift also has something that fear doesn't, more than just one time-distorting power. In this, you can stop, slow, and rewind time. Of course you'll be using slow-mo the most often, as it is super fun to calmy walk around a million bullets headed your way and destroy the people shooting at you before they had the chance to blink. The other powers are fun as well, especially time reverse. If one enemy was bugging you, you can bring him back to life using it and kill him as many times as you like.  If you don't like this game, you will get stabbed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're using an i3, i7, Intel Xeon, AMD FX 63xx, FX 83xx, or FX 92xx, or an i5 laptop, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.Any processor that supports hyperthreading will make this entirely unplayable.  Shaders will not load.  Polygonal stretching/artifacting is frequent and highly distracting.  Objects will clip out of existence from either getting close or getting far from it, revealing the out-of-bounds areas or making NPCs simply float in mid-air.  No settings will fix the bug and no fix (other than disabling hyperthreading in your BIOS... hell no) is available.  It also has severe stuttering problems, and according to some online sources the bad performance is an AMD specific bug that can't be fixed.Even more than that, you can't brute-force your way through the game and ignore your problems.  Even when you look past the invisible tiling and exposed out-of-map areas, the true game-ending bug is when your UI breaks and a giant black hexagon covers a good chunk of the center of the screen.  This makes it near-impossible to aim.  Just go play Singularity.The game itself is interesting and very enjoyable from what I've played, and if not for these shader bugs the Quake4-ish visuals hold up perfectly... but like the original Far Cry or Grim Fandango, the first big challenge is figuring out how to duct-tape the messy, outdated code together, and as of yet I haven't succeeded.  Will update review if a solution can be found.


If you're going to have a door to an infinite void, at least remember to lock it.

												Aside from the once in a while crashes due to incompatable video drivers that I can't fix. Timeshift is a very solid first person shooter, and one of my favorites for the original xbox. I could never follow the story, but the gameplay kinda makes up for it. Being able to control time in a shooter. Cool, huh? I gotta say: I find it a little disconcerting that so many other reviews of this game are negative. Stealth's advice: git gud.                                Well, I guess that wraps it up. Until next review!            Let's form up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The story is lacking but the gameplay makes up for it.  I've played the campaign 5 times, beat it on the hardest difficulty, somewhat challenging.  I highly recommend this game!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game that was pretty unheard of, at least to me, until a few years ago when steam sales were still a big novelty and undderrated gems for $2.99 were must buys. A mish mash of the trending first person shooters around it's release and shameless appropriation of their gameplay mechanics that made it's influences classics.-Story-To get it out the gate, the story is nonsensical and largely non-existent. Scientists working on suit, guy takes suit changes future, you gotta go after him... something something alternate universe that is kinda steampunk aesthetic? Something something love interest died in the past... vengeance? Something something villain is a dictatorship? You get these brief, and i mean brief, CG cutscenes of exposition that is hardly exposition but fragments lacking context. The story is not really engaging and serves merely to string the gameplay together.-Gameplay-The gameplay is the real meat of the game here. Taking heavy influence from Half-Life 2, Crysis and perhaps even FEAR. You can slow down time; slow down allows you to dodge projectiles, move faster and take out enemies easier. Stop time; completely stops time which can also allow you to pop a dude in the dome piece or steal their weapons from their hands.  And finally, rewind which allows you to rewind time.These are all used to move through puzzles outside of combat which gives it a Half-Life feel. I'll say that Rewind I only ever used in puzzles. I didn't really see how it could be that useful in combat but I never tried it. I found slow down to be the most effective in that regard.The powers are what makes the gameplay incredibly fun and probably the source of it's cult status.There are various weapons to use. Some really cool like the explosive cross bow, a cannon that fires energy or a flamethrower machine gun. They don't have a lot of kick or feel amazing to use, the more generic guns (machine gun, pistol, sniper) especially but they don't feel completely awful either. The gunplay is serviceable enough.There's no NG+ or any reason to play through a second or third time.-Performance-Rig: i7 4770k, 980ti, 16gb ram, win7Performance seems to be the biggest point of contention when discussing the game. People failing to get the game working, awful performance on Nvidia and AMD cards even on modern systems and steam running an inferior version of the game.  However, I had very little problems getting it running well. At max settings I ran at rock solid 60 fps the entire game. No bugs or atrifacting that I noticed at least. Nice lighting and rain effects that hindered performance not at all. The issues I did have though; Booting it up presents a box saying video drivers out of date or some such. Which isn't true? You can click through it and doesn't seem to effect the game but it is strange and a mild hindrance.My biggest problem is that though it was 60 fps at all times there was some kind of... jitter? I've had this problem before in Borderlands: Pre Sequel and couldn't fix it there either. The game does have mouse acceleration that you can't turn off. So perhaps that is the crux of the issue but I turned the games mouse sens all the way down and my mouse dpi all up, which seemed to help a little but then the mouse sense wasn't good enough in game. However, this is an issue I've not seen anyone else complain about.In closing,It's not a bad game. I'm pretty positive on it, though i think the underrated status is kind of exaggerated. Stopping time then quickly headshotting 5 enemies, stealing the shot gun out the hands of another, unstopping time, popping dude in the head while he's confused is pretty fun. And there's a lot of fun to be had with that. The puzzles aren't terribly hard and usually a one of the powers is the answer.The story is not at all the reason to play and hardly the talking point of the fans.It's not a solid 'buy this full price' reccomendation but during a steam sale, it's worth picking up and getting a fun 8 hour campaign.

												TimeShift represents a typical old school linear shooter with time manipulation aspects. The ability to stop time is overused to the point where I found myself stopping time for everything stripping away a lot of the challenge and enjoyment. The story and gameplay are mediocre at best. Enemies really don't stand a chance when you can unload a full clip into their head while they are frozen. I suppose if I would have played this game when it was released, I would have been left with a better overall impression, but it doesn't have a lot to offer compared to modern equivalents today.

												I'd recommend you pick this one up if it's on sale like 75% off or something, it's a fun shooter, there are about 9 weapons or so and most of them feel great, my favorite being the shotgun and they have alternate fire modes too, usually being a more powerful ""blast"" that consumes more bulletsThen there are the time bending mechanics, you can slow time, stop it altogether or reverse it, consuming your suit's energy to do so, granted it regenerates quickly so no need to worry all that much about saving it, it's pretty satisfying to kill your enemies in slow motion and you can do fun stuff like grabbing their weapons and see them running around in fear as you do so and there are a few really easy ""puzzles"" throughout the game using these mechanics aswellThe problem with the combat however, is that it can be quite easy and become a bit repetitive as the game goes on, basically you slow time, blast some fools and then run to cover to regenerate your suit's energy / your health and repeat the process, some enemies try to charge to your cover location but it really doesn't matter all that much since you have your radar and you can see the red dot coming by which ends up making things even easier for youStory wise it's pretty darn forgettable, an evil scientist dude steals the ""Alpha Suit"" and travels trough time so you grab the ""Beta Suit"" and ""time jump"" to go after him in an alternate reality in the beginning of the game but it's pretty hard to care for the ""resistance"" or the villain at all, he barely shows up, maybe twice at most in the game and I don't think he even has 1 line of dialogue in it, then you get these 2 second cutscenes every now and then which are like flashbacks that try to build some semblance of a plot, and then there's this pretty annoying resistance leader guy who keeps shouting at you constantly throughout the whole game to do everything, ""Hurry press that button"" ""Cmon soldier! Do this!"" ""Do that"" ""Hurry"" ""Go! What are you waiting for?"" ""We need fuel!"" which all culminates in a pretty anti-climactic and confusing / sequel bait-ish endingAnd that's one of the other issues about the gameplay, all your objectives are really boring, it pretty much consists of pressing buttons or pulling levers all game, and there's no exploration at all, when I started playing I looked at every nook and cranny like I usually do in games but quickly learned that it was a pointless exercise, you have regenerating health and ammo is plentiful too so you pretty much never run out of it, so you're just going level to level, waypoint to waypoint pressing buttons and killings dudes with combat that turns repetitive after a while and in the end you have a very easy and disappointing final bossPlus if my playtime's any indication the game's 5-7 hours long at most and multiplayer is dead for this game, so combining  all that you can really see why this game wasn't initially well received in the first place, and after I read a bit on it apparently it had a really rocky development cycle, changing publishers a few times and even it's story was scrapped and completely reworked a few months before releaseSo in conclusion: like I said in the beginning of this review it's still a fun shooter with some interesting mechanics that weren't quite fully realized but at the end of the day is not really worth it's full price, just wait for a sale and you'll power through it in a few hours			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The perfect game to get on sale if you want to shoot people in the face in slow motion. While the graphics were dated for a 2007 game, and the level design leaves something to be desired, the game is worth it due to the time mechanic. While your character has low health, and while the AI of the enemies is well coded, the game makes up for this by allowing you to slow/stop/rewind time, and shoot people in the face in slow motion. However, at the same time there are better FPSes with similar time mechanics such as Singularity avaliable on Steam. While this is a good game to get on sale for $3-4 to have some fun with, there are better FPSes avaliable for $20.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the most underrated game I've ever played. If you haven't played it, PLAY IT. The story is really cool, although it may seem a little basic and to some confusing, but the multiplayer was the one thing I will always remember. The ""Control Time"" mechanic is something REALLY well done and an idea that I wish would come back to life in a similar way. Being able to throw secondary grenades in multiplayer that explode in a bubble of ""Time"" to trap enemies is one of my favorite features. Overall if you thought about buying this game, I would recommend giving the Single Player a try, the multiplayer servers are dead but I would be more than happy to play with anyone interested.

												A well thought out game, the game play is fun, and a fair bit intuitive. It plays a bit like a secret agent game, like James Bond ETC. You're usually alone, and the only capable person around. It's the most fun when playhed on EASY, and to pretend you're some kind of action hero. Higher difficulties can provide fun for people that require a greater challange, but I personally played this light heartedly and roleplayed the heck out of it. I recommened picking this up at a cheap sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a long review so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend TimeShift then skip to Results and read from there.Saber Interactive creates an epic first person shooter that allows you to manipulate time in order to solve puzzles and defeat hordes of enemies. TimeShift accomplishes what other games only can dream off with brilliant mechanics and fantastic gameplay elements.Story:Timeshift offers a game that essentially has no elements of a story until the entire campaign is completed. Don’t worry once the game is over you will finally be given the story. You play a scientist who is part of a team developing a suit that allows you to traverse time. Dr. Aiden Krone director of the project realizes the power that the suit holds and uses the Alpha suit to jump back in time. This gives him the ability to create a dystopia where he rules in an alternate timeline that parallels WWII. You take the Beta suit, a newer version that has not been tested, in order to jump back in time and bring Krone to his knees.Campaign:The campaign consists of twenty-four levels, each of varying length and difficulty. The campaign is a combination of puzzle solving, first person shooters, and boss fights. You have to use your suits to reverse time, pause time, and slow time in order to get through traps, operate systems, and defeat enemies. With a combination of boss fights and hordes of enemies you must accomplish objectives. Overall the campaign should take about eight hours, depending on difficulty. With the difficulty selection you can control the strength and numbers of the enemies, but the difficulty of the puzzles cannot be adjusted. The puzzles allow the campaign to be entertaining even if the campaign is on easy.Gameplay:The game has nine weapons (KM-33, KM 2103 Karbine, Shattergun, Echo Rifle, ThunderBolt, E.M.F. Cannon, Bloodhound, Hell-Fire, and SurgeGun) and grenades. I found myself rarely using grenades throughout the campaign, because of the high weapon variability. Most of the guns have a secondary fire mode, which allows them to be versatile. Not only do you have a large variety of weapons to make the campaign entertaining, but you also have the ability to control time. The suit allows you to pause time, slow time, and reverse time. Each of these features can be used to change how the game plays. For example when enemies throw grenades you can reverse time in order to cause the grenades to go back to their host. You can pause time in order to heal yourself, and slow time to rush up to enemies and blast them before they can react. Time control combines elements of Max Paynes bullet time, and pushes it further with much more diversity.Results:TimeShift is a brilliant game that was ahead of tis time. The story is brilliant and complex, yet not clearly dictated. You will want to know what is going on, but after everything is over you will finally understand what happened. There are twenty-four levels and each level is of decent length. The gameplay offers both advanced concepts used in future titles, and also new concepts that although brilliant have never made an appearance again. With the ability to fully control time, either by outright stopping it, slowing it, and even reversing it creates a diverse game which combines all dimensions. TimeShift combines puzzle solving with action to create an epic adventure that is absolutely amazing. I would recommend TimeShift even if you pay full price, $19.99, it is still a good deal; although, if you can get TimeShift on sale it is a steal and I would completely recommend it.Pros:+Ability to stop, slow, and reverse time.+Loads of weapons to mess around with that have secondary fire modes.+Fast paced combat+Puzzles that require you to use special tactics to solve.+There are loads of ammo boxes so you don’t ever feel low on ammo.+Epic boss fight that finishes the game in a bang.+Loads of enemies that make the game refreshing.Cons:-The story doesn’t present itself till after you complete the entire campaign.-Controls are not as obvious and it took me a while to figure out I could look down the barrel.-Most of the weapons are not available till late in the game.

												Timeshift is the prime example of a good concept (time manipulation) badly rendered. The story in itself is utterly slim and unattractive (and with quite the erratic narrative) :  a scientist, Krone, decied to found his own empire in an alternate timeline and you go after him. The end. No surprises, no twist, no incentive to continue. The hero is a soulless mute, joining the Resistance just because and being ordered around, while nobody bats and eyelid at a suit guy appearing from nowhere and able to manipulate time around him.There's a grand total of two timejumps !But well, story is not meant to be the strongest point of a FPS. Problem is, the gameplay is also lacking. Not that it plays badly- on the opposite, it plays quite smoothly. But the game is far too easy. Your ability to slow time, combined with the quick regeneration of your health and a genous cooldown for time-controlling abilities, makes you near-invulnerable if you stay cautious. The game compensates by unleashing hordes of brainless soldiers, but it just makes the fights longer, not more interesting.The puzzles are short of anything creative. A puddle of electrified water ? Stop the time, the water is solidified, go unscathed. The bridge is collapsing ? Activate return, walk on it as it goes back in time for your needs. It won't challenge your intellect, rest assured.The weapons feel good, especially the explosive crossbow, but in the end you feel like you spend most of your times pushing buttons and going back. Cooke, the leader of the Resistance, yelling at you every twenty seconds in some sections till you accomplish the objective is quite unnerving. The game is mercifully rather short- about 8 hours, without replay value. In a way, it's quite soothing because you stomp the ennemies with your arsenal and slow time capacity, but it was really clunky and uninspired at the time, it's not better now. If you want a FPS with the Time them and a good dose of humor, try Time Splitters : Future Perfect. Else, even Singularity is more convincing than Timeshift : at least you interact with the world, you're not a mute puppet in a suit.Surely Saber Interactive is doing better now, but then they have also produced Battle Los Angeles... Not the brightest past.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very good FPS. The time shifting elements are a great addition to a game that reminds me of the original Far Cry. The weapons are all unique and are great killing machines from a distance or close up.  There are several enemy types and they require different tactics in order to defeat each type. Their tactics are great as well and they have good AI movements. The weapons and enemies keep the game from being stale in any way and I have enjoyed all the levels that I have completed so far. I highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I write this negative review only as a warning to those interested in buying the game.  TimeShift  itself is actually really fun  and I hate to taint the review status because of this issue.  However, Steam should really warn people of these problems before selling a product.  Out of hundreds of games I own this is the only one that I have to do this with in order for the game to work.

												TimeShift starts out as your run-of-the-mill shooter, weapons handle nicely..but nothing notable, AI is fairly average, and the visuals were good for the time (but not great). The Time control mechanic works really nicely in this game, and that's when it evolves from run-of-the-mill to something special. It's a hidden gem, overlooked by the big boys of the time (Gears, CoD4, Halo 3 and so on).-You Can SLOW DOWN AND PAUSE TIME (This alows you to pull off some really neat looking kills, and hell even steal youropponet's weapon and shoot em' in the face)-You Can REWIND/REVERSE TIME (Ever had a nade thrown in your face, or the enemy spotting you too quickly and ruining your fairly stealthy approach? No problem just reverse time and handle the situation!People complain about the Time control mechanic being too short or too gimicky..but in reality with the help of a good shot lined up and time slowed you can easily take out 5-6 enemies within your short burst of Time halted/slowed.Overall, a good game..It's not great, but it is something unique. Definitely worth taking a look at if you haven't already.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Plays sort of like a poor man's F.E.A.R. in the most endearing way possible. Though not quite as razor-sharp in presentation or as visceral in immediate player feedback, TimeShift still manages to be an enjoyable run-and-gun action blowout. It can be surprisingly tough, requiring you to think on your feet and make judicious use of the slow, stop, and reverse ability in your repertoire, but when it all falls together in a single burst of violence, the reward can be thrilling. A flat, generic visual style and a sometimes excruciatingly slow ability recharge time are about the only things I can complain about.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion, this game is a hidden treasure. Very surprised at how how well it plays with various strategies required for using time manipulation. Good graphics and action but no character development. Reasonable value and can be found for a low price. I have 10 hours playing time in and about half way through it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A lot of thought has gone into making it different, there are some interesting challenges and good character interaction - and its not another WW2 game! With shades of HL2 and Crysis this is however very much its own game with a 1984/Orwellian atmosphere and an essential time shift ability this really works as a game. The ability to manipulate time becomes second nature as the game progresses. Slow time to take on the enemy when you are outnumbered. Pause time to walk up and take a weapon, or take on another bloke in a time suit. Reverse time, to go up in a lift that has just fallen. It's also possible to pause time to enable you to step of a runaway train, walk through fire, walk on water etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yes. I recommend this game for anyone who remembers the 2002-2007 era First Person Shooter games with warmth. This game is filled with a bunch of cliches, bad dialogue, flat characters and an uninteresting story, but my damn if it isn't worth a playthrough.The game's general design incorporates the usage of time manipulation: slow-mo, stop and reverse. You are definitely not being dragged down by the storyline, but are instead left alone with you, a bunch of enemies and your powers most of the time. The strength of this title is definitely in those time abilities, as it doesn't get old to go into slow mo, shoot eight guys in the head with the shotgun and then go back and watch them fall to the ground instantly.  It's not a very long game and it's not too difficult. It's a good thing in this case, as variety isn't a featured element. Yes, there are a few vehicle and turret sections, but they're very short and, well, a little boring.On the surface this title is far from perfect, but beneath it's got it's own charm. And unlike most TV shows it quits before people get bored of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am voting Yes, but there are several things I am not at all pleased with.Firstly, I found no direct controller support, and the functions of the time control on the KB are not fun to use.There were some issues getting the game to launch, but I reinstalled it later and it worked after ignoring the ""Incompatible Drivers"" warning.That being said, the game is not that bad.  If you liked Half Life, the original Red Faction, Time Splitters, and other games like these, you will probably enjoy TimeShift.  It really isn't bad.People may complain about it being dated graphics or design...  and?  It is an older game, but it is a decent older game, IF YOU LIKED HALF LIFE.If you see it on sale and want a game that feels like most PS2, GameCube, XBOX era FPS shooters, this looks a bit nicer, and feels really similar.  It is a good fit, just wish I could use a controller for time controlling :/			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm only JUST giving this a recommended mark. This is a bit of an odd game structure wise. Gameplay is a pretty straightforward run and gun with time manipulation thrown in. The gameplay is fun, who doesn't enjoy blowing stuff up in slow motion or stopping time to set up your attacks. The guns are nice with a primary and secondary function.The weird stuff now.....The story isn't very well told, or it's so basic that it goes over your head. There's no background but only suggestive themes as to why and how you got into the situation you're in. Also, the intermitent cutscenes interrupt the gameplay at the most odd times and make the games story feel a bit disjointed. You are only allowed three guns at a time, no biggie and it cuts out the confusion of switching weapons. There are no upgrades or hidden logs/items/badges/collectables anywhere, which can be a relief just to know you can play the game without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥around looking for stuff. It would have been nice to have some sort of feature to upgrade the amount of time you can manipulate time, it feels too short. Half of the game I got a distinct feeling that I'd played a similar game in the past or one of many similar games. It tries to do the WW2 theme a little too similar to Return to castle wolfenstein and is heavily influenced by Half life and Half life 2, even some of the areas are laid out with a familiar feeling. By the end of the game, I'd felt like I'd just wasted a good 9 hours on a ""ho hum"" story, on the other hand I did enjoy the gunplay and time altering gameplay. I'd say, don't buy this at full price, it does have it's moments but not worth a 9 hour run n gun romp with a basic story. Its totally linear brainless fun.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Basically a Halo clone, with some time quirks.Nothing ground-breaking, no awesome plot, not even health packs, just people to kill.Don't play it if :-you don't like regenerating health,-you don't like following an arrows on the top of the screen (top right actually),-you don't like carrying only 3 weapons, no matter if they are pistols or rocket launcher.If you don't mind those, you might enjoy the game.

												All things considered, I'm quite enjoying this. It plays like a corridor shooter from the early 2000s, but the gunplay is smooth and the time-shifting mechanics are genuinely well-implimented and I found myself having a lot of fun in the run-and-gun sections. The difficulty is punishing even on normal, and your abilities are essential to survival, but this isn't so much a criticism as an observation.For all its shortcomings in terms of being 'up to date' to the shooters released at the time, I find that Timeshift is certainly worth the sale price. I wouldn't pay the full 14 bucks for it though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Decent little shooter, fun toying with time. Considering its age, was not too bad. Nothing too sophisticated, with little variety in game play - once the basics are mastered the rest is fairly easy. Don't get it if you're looking for a deep story or rich characters, you're simply here to kill everything and solve a few puzzles using time manipulation. Get it if you want a shooter that does things a little differently.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So far, the only downside is the 2007 graphics, but what can you do with a game from 2007?At 6 hours for compleation, it's also a bit short. but you only complaine about a game beeing short if you had fun...This is all about the single plyer - I haven’t tried, nor intend to try, multiplayer.Interface is okGameplay is nice - strait up old style shooter (before cover based shooters were all the fad), 1-Vs-army (but this time the 1 winning actually makes sense...). Gimmick is way fun - you have 3 time manipulating powers witch can be activated manually, of let the computer choose based on the situation. Those powers let you do some really fun stuff, like popping up, firing 4 rockets and crouching again, all while the enemies try to figure out what happened.Plot is ok so far - the story is told in tiny little pieces (with much killing fun in between) and I really want to know what happened.To sum up: sometimes you just want to kick it old-school and waste 100+ fools.

												One of the first mature games I ever owned as a kid and I can't thank the guy at Hollywood Video (that dates the purchase) enough for recommending it to my 12 year old self. This is a very underrated game that never really got too much attention and that is a shame. It is extremely fun to play with a variety of game mechanics and abilities at your disposal. As you can probably tell it deals primarily with time abilities but has some varied gunplay as well with many interesting ways to approach situations. The unique gameplay is going to be the main focus of the game but the story is interesting enough to at least keep you entertained. 20 dollars is still a hefty price but you get around 7-8 hours of gameplay for the main story plus decent replayablity. This game should be considered a classic and a pioneer. Check it out if you can.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story:  You're thrown into the action (in media res) and you never really find out who you're chasing any why. You occasionally get some pillow talk cutscenes that are just confusing.Gunplay: A lot of fun  slowing, stopping and reversing time to make your enemies look like idiots. After a while this becomes routine and nothing is a real threat, but it never stops being fun.Level Design: not bad, in a Half-Life kind of way. Some great steampuk-esque aesthetic as you clamber over airships and through giant bases, sometimes fighting alongside rebels, sometimes doing simple time-based puzzles.Ending: As you're preparing yourself to fight the guy you've been chasing for hours, the game suddenly ends with you defeating him in a cutscene.Verdict: Great brainless fun with good production values.

												TimeShift succeeds in being one of those games where it's required of the player to pay attention to detail if they want to understand the ending. Because the ending can be confusing if you weren't following along with the cutscenes or any of the dialog spoken by Krone during various instances.Before I get into the game itself, a few things you should know if you want TimeShift to run properly on your system:1. Find the TimeShift.exe in the install folder and change the compatibility to Windows XP (SP3)2. Find and install patch 1.2 for the game as Steam/Activision only have it updated to 1.0 and you'll have a slew of problems.I'm pretty sure those two cover it, the game will run much more smoothly and won't/shouldn't freeze on any loading screen or when paused.I can't say I enjoyed the overall story in TimeShift, the whole stop a madman from ruining everything in a dystopia seemed rather generic. I did like that the protagonist stays unnamed and has ulterior motives when he jumps into the past to save the future. The gameplay was rather repetitive, running and gunning, going through vast buildings, pushing buttons, sometimes driving, using a turret, climbing up and down ladders. That's pretty much it. The saving grace with the gameplay is the time manipulation ability that comes with the Beta suit that the protagonist has. It's really cool, being able to stop time and seeing rain just frozen in mid air. Or reversing an action if you messed up. Or slowing down time/being able to move really fast.I guess my biggest complaint was how uninspired the story seemed at times. There's hardly any background as you're just thrown into a situation. I would compare the whole situation of a dystopian world and you're the hero to Half Life, but at least in Half Life, there's context given and side characters that explain the situation. The side characters in TimeShift are so minor that I actually thought they were expendable and was surprised when the small crew you're with for a large portion of the game survives. Granted, you're not actually with them; most of the time, they'll stay behind and let you do all the work.At least the graphics are still pretty good. Obviously a bit dated being 8 years old now but the whole world had an atmosphere of 'wow, this place is really falling apart' and added so much to the overbearing dystopia. Sound design was pretty great too.Anyway, while it has a number of flaws, TimeShift still proved to be fun after I got it working.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Timeshift is one of those games that you don't expect to be as enjoyable as it actually is.The basic plot of the game is that a scientist has stolen a time traveling suit and has become a dictator. You are one of his colleges who has strapped on another version of the suit and jumped after him, leading to your suit getting damaged. From there you join the resistance and go ham on it. The game doesn't really have much more plot than that, just a good 6 or so hours of really good shooting.Combat is your standard FPS style mass murdering fun, with a twist. You can only carry two guns at any given time, from the standard pistol and rifle, to energy cannons and exploding crossbows. Each and every gun is satisfying, providing a good, hard punch, it also helps that the enemies have fun ragdoll physics. The twist is you have time powers, three in fact. Pause, slow down, and rewind. You are unaffected by the time powers you activate, but everything else? Not so much. It makes for some fun puzzle solving in the game, and adds a nice extra layer to the classic ""shoot dude in head"" gameplay.The game looks ok, I also encountered no glitches throughout my playthrough. The only Issue I have with it is the lack of bosses, even the final boss is lack luster, but overall, the experience was satisfying and I certainly recommend it to anyone who's a fan of FPS's.

												-Ignore my time spent playing on Steam, I originally played this on PlayStation 3 upon its release-This game is by far  one of the greatest shooters I've ever played! You can slow down the time, freeze time, reverse time, and it's all blowing my mind! Perhaps one of my favorite thing to do in this game is to completely freeze time and fire bullets all around the enemy and then just stand there and watch as time flows normally and all of my bullets simultaneously hits the enemy from all directions. This game is an undiscovered gem my friends. Please get this, you must experience how amazing this game is and how it stands out from the rest of the shooters on the market.

												I definitely enjoy this game. In a nutshell, it's a Half-Life 2 clone with a unique twist: you can manipulate time to slow down, stop, or reverse for a brief period of time.Now, don't get me wrong, this is NOT Half-Life. The story is meh, and levels can get a bit repetitive. However, there are some interesting physics/time puzzles scattered throughout. In my opinion, not quite worth the $20 it's priced at, but I picked it up on sale for $5 and it was definitely worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game for 7 tf2 hats, and it must be said it is worth much much more. This game might be semi-linear, but it makes up for it by adding unique powers(time pause, time slow, and reverse time). The only real reason I got this game though was because of it's alloy of Crysis mixed with F.E.A.R enviornment which, in my opinion is an automatic buy to me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game! Loved it the day it came out. In my opinion, this is one of the most UNDERRATED FPS games out there. It has mind-blowing graphics(for a 10 year old game), the storyline is just amazing, even though some things aren't very well explained, even in the end, that's not bad though, it doesn't have a bad ending or anything. It'll just leave you with lots of questions and, of course - begging for a sequel. And of course, last but not least - the gameplay, its awesome and very unique, in my opinion. I love this game. I would give it a 10/10. Overall GREAT GAME!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine TimeShift is a game developed by Saber Interactive and originally published by Sierra Entertainment however after Sierra shut down its doors, Activision is now the current publisher of TimeShiftWhile I find the still 14.99EUR price tag a bit too much for an 8 year old game I still found this very enjoyableThe game is very much like the Half Life series as it blends puzzles in with action and genuinely tried something innovative with the time control mechanics which work very wellThe graphics are pretty good although the environments can look very bland. Lot of flat textures and the colors are mostly greyThe story itself is very much like Half Life 2 as there is a dystopian future (or past as it is in this game) that is ruled over by a tyrant. The voice acting isn't bad but it's nothing to write home about and it doesn't get in the wayThe weapons are all varied and pretty damn fun to use. The action in the game really feels like one of those games nowadays that tries to capture that ""old-school"" shooter vibe and yet the game just plays it straightThis is the only purely action time manipulation game I can think of other than maybe Singularity although it's not really the same manipulationIs it the best game ever? No. It's weak story and bland environments really bring the game down and you'll find yourself not caring about any of the stories or charactersIf you are looking for an action packed old school style shooting game however this is the game for you! RECOMMENDED :)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A hidden gem, in my opinion. A good shooter, with good mechanics, and decent replayability. You can have a lot of fun with the time manipulation, trust me. The story though, is not the best. One of my favorite games back when it was released in late 2007; I'm pretty sure shooter-fans will not be disappointed by this. As of now, wait for a sale if you plan on buying this title.Rating - 8/10. Neat!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Didn't expect much from it but got a fun, fast paced and linear 10 hour campaign. The story is almost nonexistent and is pretty much just an excuse to run around and murder people with time manipulation mechanics. Your health regenerates and there are no pickups other than enemy dropped weapons and the occasional weapon chest, so you'll just be going forward all the time and obliterating everything on your way, which I usually find boring but the TimeShifting mechanics make it very enjoyable. I definitely recommend getting it on a sale.WARNING: I tried running this game a few years ago on a machine with an AMD GPU and the game stuttered so much it was unplayable. It now works perfectly on my new Nvidia GPU, so be warned, it may not work on AMD GPUs!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I first played this game after it was just released, 7 years ago. I just played it through again and it still feels like a great and new game. The gameplay is fun (manipulate time!), the graphics are decent though my standards for good graphics are CS:S-like. The only thing I missed back in 2007 was the lack of people on multiplayer, which now is basically unexisting. I can recommend this game to everyone who wants to play a SinglePlayer game with a good/fun story and medium-paced gameplay. The puzzles aren't complicated yet keep you entertained, the story missions are well fun and worth playing through multiple times. This game deserves the 71/100 metascore and I'd give it around 7.5/10 myself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												And here we come to one more underrated game. I played this game in 2008 but dropped it soon after I started.  And the reason was poor storytelling.  This time I was more patient and clever.  Well, firs thing first: now I tell you what this game actually about. Our protagonist works in some very advanced research facility  where they develop suits  which can manipulate time. But it is clearly understandable is he a scientist or some kind of science CIA agent to watch over scientists do not use their inventions in some ""improper"" way like your antagonist did. And head of research team was one badass scientist named Krone who stole of suits, blew up the facility, jumped back in time and made himself a dictator. Well, he oppressed the people, and the was a rebellion. And we jumped in time to the end of the rebellion. This is the moment you star playing this game and you see only grey concrete around, ugly city, revolutionaries who look like hobos and terrorists, you get some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pistol and machine gun, you cannot manipulate time, you get a feeling that you constantly loosing and finally you see how rebellion...failed. This is the time when fun starts. Your suit sends you back in time several days before the rebellion. And you get a shotgun and grenades and this grenades are sticky...and electricizing. The stick to an enemy and he is screaming ""Oh, my god explosives. Hit the deck"" while been bitten by electric current and then BAM! And now you can manipulate time: stop, reverse and slow. Well you user ""reverse"" to get to some places to advance in the game, ""slow"" is for slow motion as in every other game except everything you do happen in usual timeline, for example you throw a grenade in ""slow"" and while enemies run in slo-mo and scream in slow-mo it explodes with usual speed, and with ""stop"" you can come to bunch of enemies and take their weapons from their hands and the listen how they say kinda ""well, dude, you see we are unarmed so...move along"". And you storm prison and stronghold.  And you get sniper rifle and rocket launcher and crossbow with exploding bolts and hand cannon with exploding ammo and machine gun with flammable ammo and electro gun. And you meet enemies with jetpacks, kinetic shield enemies, enemies who can manipulate time and teleport enemies and enemy heavy walker and helicopters. And then you hijack big flyers...well, a lot of stuff will happen in this game. And with all this stuff you kinda do some corrections to the course of rebellion and for it outcome.And exploding barrels! LOTS OF THEM!!!But still because of poor storytelling you will keep asking yourself: who are these people around you? why are you with them? why? why?So if you put aside shady beginning, lack of storytelling and sudden end it is 2007 rail shooter at best. 7/10.

												The Good:Given the age of the game I think the graphics hold up very well both on a technical level and an artistic level. The atmosphere is also somewhat unique consisting of a 1939 steampunk distopian world. The weapons all feel unique and provide different tactical arrangements given the situation your in. The 'gimmick' in this game is that you can slow, stop, and reverse time not only to defeat your enemies but also to solve puzzles. The game is also the right length, not too long for its own good but not short either. It knows exactly when its time is up. I also thought the level design was excellent and varied, although most of the levels revolve around the standard FPS gameplay their were other levels consisitng of driving and turret levels to keep things fresh. The Bad:The story is a bit hard to follow at first and its hard to care about any of the characters in the game. The game can also be a bit frustrating especially towards the end of the game. The game is also very rushed near the end leading to a very anticlimatic battle. Conclusion:This game really surprised me, and highly underatted. The level design and areas reminded me a lot of half life 2 although no where near the same quality and that is the biggest problem with the game. For all its trying to do, other games have done it better making this game feel a bit average. Still I highly recommend you check this game out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't look at my play time. I used another exe (not for this game, obviously) to get 5 minutes to write this review. Maybe my review would help somebody.Game doesn't work if you have Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 x64The only way to play this game is to disable HyperThreading option in your BIOS. If you can't, just like me... Well, you're f@#ked up. Sorry.UPD. I should say, that this game has been developed by russian company Saber Interactive (well, not exactly russian, but most of developers are working in Saint Petersburg), and problems with running older games on modern PCs are quite a common problem for russian games. A pity. At least TimeShift isn't a bad game, especially for russian game studio. It even have its moments.I recommend you to check if you can disable HyperThreading, and if you can - buy it, especially when its on sale. TimeShift worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bland world doesn't develop as you progress, same assets are used everywhere. Story after the introductory CGI only gets worse and worse. The final battle is just meh.After almost 10 years still has game breaking bugs. At certain point it's impossible to progress if the barrels are destroyed by scripted event, the grate is not thrown away by explosion and you have to explode the barrels yourself for it unlock the path what's a bit tricky to do. When solving some puzzles the ability timer is drained too fast and you have to constantly retry it until it goes slower for no apparent reason. At certain point it's almost impossible to perform a jump you have to mash whitespace like crazy for it work. I've had to use online walkthrough to find workarounds for that nonsense.15€ for this? No, i can't recommend it, it's a bad game, even by 2007 standarts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a shooter in which you can do some time manipulation. With this trick you have to solve some puzzles and you can easily kill swarm of enemies. Sounds pretty cool, but fails to last throughout the game. To me it got boring very quickly since it takes away the challenge from combat. The background story is misty and pretty much lacking. It's just a boring game. This time manipulation concept works way better in other games (FEAR, Singularity, Quantum Break).

												I could only play three levels of this game.  I think by that admission we know where this review is going. I don't know why I bought this game, if it was in a bundle, or if I mistook it for another time game, what ever the reasons, I wish I could give it back.  It's not that it's a horrendous game, but with a name like Timeshift, you have a lot of great possible features that will blow a players mind. This game though doesn't do any of them.  This is a very by the numbers shooters with a time power that is almost mandatory.  In the first three levels, you constantly feel overwhelmed, but the time power doesn't really make up for it, a lot of this game is use the time power, shoot a few people, hide again wait for the time power (And health) regen, do it again. The abilities you have in the game are interesting, but the game overall is quite uninteresting.  The story is weak, the gameplay is about the same, and the graphics... well the first level is a dull grey, with enemies running around, and while there's big enemies you can't fight (yet?) overall you're running around dull hallways, shooting dull enemies, running in parks, in drab environments, shooting dull enemies, the game never really evolves beyond the dull lack luster experience that it starts with.Who knows, the fourth level might be the best level in video games ever, but I couldn't stay interested long enough to e even reach it.  And I have a feeling you'd be shooting the same drab enemies over and over.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So i did some research and found that this game crashes if you enable interlacing, which is something that has to do with your gpu and how it streams its data that almost every modern gpu uses by default, which has to be changed in the B.I.O.S. Which makes it confusing how I managed to play about a half an hour of this before it crashed in game, and loading a save only made it crash again during the loading screen, and the community seems to not have a fix for it. Starting a new game also didn't work in case you didn't think I tried. Downvoting until i hear it's fixed, odds are with a game this old now it will never happen. Really fun though, controller pretty much necessary.Edit: So I looked at this review and realized that I pretty much didn't cover any of the game I actually played, so in short, it has some decent puzzle elements, like stopping a fan blade over a death pit and walking across per say, or walking up to a dude, taking his gun and punching him in the face. You would not believe how much fun that is until you try it. I've played through most of the game on my friends ps3, which is why I picked it up, however I'm still dissapointed that there isn't a solution for my problem no matter how hard I look, considering my BIOS is apparently crap and I don't have interlacing options. This is a good game, and I reccomend picking it up, just not on PC, I hate to say it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the dictionary definition of mediocre.While there is nothing blantantly wrong with it, it does not excel in any department either.Being able to control time at will sounds like a great mechanic but it is poorly implemented in this game.During combat all you need to do is slow down time and you become virtually untouchable. which takes away any sort of tension during firefights. It seems the develepers tried to account for this by making enemy fire highly lethal (meaning a couple of shots to the face and you're dead), and by having enemies ambush you -- as if they come out of nowhere -- resulting in constant reloadings back to the previous checkpoint.Even having purchased this game on sale I cannot recommended it since, despite giving it an honest try, it offers no entertainment value.

												On medium it took me 10 hours. KI is not as good as the one of F.E.A.R,, but close to it. With the time stopping, forwarding and backwarding you have an unfair advantage - and they are used for some minor puzzles. Story is forgettable - and dat ending, dat bossfight... My oh my! Game has its lenghts (even if it´s only 10 hours on medium...or as they call it ""hard"")- you run around from checkpoint to checkpoint, kill some enemies, do some minor task - and that´s it. If you don´t move over a certain line the enemy doesn´t engage you.  Game mechanics are fine.Even for today graphics, and effects are good - not outrageously excellent, but very solid. Soundtrack is ok, but nothing that stay is one´s memory. I still recommend it if it is on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
