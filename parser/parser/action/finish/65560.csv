												The Painkiller: Redemption experience can be more or less summarized like this:You enter a cramped area filled with a dozen or so enemies. You kill them. A dozen or so more spawn. You kill them. A dozen or so more spawn. You kill them. A dozen or so more spawn. You kill them. You start to notice how obtrusively restrictive the level design is on your movement. You start to feel claustrophobic, but instead of instilling fear it instills disgruntlement. I thought this was supposed to be a Painkiller game, you think to yourself. A dozen or so more spawn with a few tougher enemies. You kill them and stand next to the door to the next shooting cell, because surely that had to be the last wave of enemies. NOPE ♥♥♥♥ YOU 3 MORE WAVES.You alt-f4 out of the game, delete it from your library, and stare out your bedroom window, reminiscing about the $5 you just blew on this steaming pile of refuse.

												I picked up this game on sale for about 70 cents, mainly because its the only one i could find at that price for my leftover cash.  about a week after buying it, i decided to give it a try.  Expecting a stupid, glitchy fps, i was surprised.  The game is actually pretty fun. you have 5-6 different weapons to mow down thousands of creatures charging at you.  It is really freaking satisfying to cut down a herd of 30 demons with a laser fired from a skull.  I haven't really figured out much how you progress yet, but just mow down enough demons and the next door will open.  If this game is on sale pick it up, and consider buying it even if it isnt.  good game to buy with your leftover cash.			",60,1,4,2,11,1,4

												I don't usually do this kind of thing.This game is terrible. Irredeemable. Literally nothing that was enjoyable about the first game is left; do you like fighting endless waves of enemies in tiny rooms for no reason? Did you play Painkiller and think ""wow, I wish the areas were more enclosed and less aethestically interesting""? Well, then, you are a moron, and should buy not only this but also Painkiller Overdose and Redemption. For anyone else, stay far away. Buy Painkiller Black -- it's good. Don't buy this.

												No, no and once again: !!! NO !!!  This is clearly the worst painkiller game ever made, maybe even worst FPS shooter ever made.. This game si a big insult to a painkiller series.. First of all, theres is nothing new, absolutely nothing new.. AH SORRY I FORGOT RESKINED MENU.. otherwise nothing new.. Every single monster you see could have been seen in previous painkiller games and they didnt even tried to make some kind of reskin.. OH I FORGOT THAT THEY MADE THE GIANT SKELETONS A 0,001FT. TALLER.. otherwise nothing.. Same with weapons, there is also one annoying thing about them, you have all weapons from the start, so u cant experience that kind of feeling when you say to yourself: ""ahh I found a new weapon, well let´s see what it does"".. The game just simply tells you: U CAN CHANGE YOUR WEAPONS BY PRESSING 1,2,3,4,5,6.. DONT YOU DARE EXPECT FROM US THAT YOULL FIND SOME NEW WEAPON DURING YOUR WAY.. levels are the only new thing, but as a only new thing which was truly made by developers which made this game (previous game had different developers), its extremely frustrating, unoriginal and stereothype, for example: ""HMM LETS NAME THIS LEVEL ""SPIKES"" BECAUSE IN THE FIRST ROOM THERE ARE SOME SPIKE PLATFORM HANGING ON THE CEILLING.. if u expected some level in which youll have to avoid spikes or use them to kill enemies, then youre ♥♥♥♥ed up in the face by this♥♥♥♥♥♥ because its just simple unoriginal castle/cathedral like level which you have seen a tons of times already.. the levels by the way are long, but no no no no, wait, stop thinking about it.. they arent long, because there are tons of rooms to explore, non-linear path or something like that.. no, the think is, that the developers thought, that the games which were created before had a low number of monsters.. so they added 10, NO, 100, NO, 500, NO, 1.000 HELL YEAAAH, ONE ♥♥♥♥ING THOUSAND OF MONSTERS PER LEVEL.. and I only played first level, god helps the players who made it through the first level, and they are experiencing 10.000 thousand enemies.. its extremely frustrating, if level without the monsters has only 5 minutes playthrough, while with them, its playthrough is like 40 minutes, 2 hours if u play on harder difficulty, because guess what ? every ♥♥♥♥ing arena has like 150 monsters inside it, but dont be fooled, they arent there right at the time when you step in, they teleport to the arena by one, so its extremely annoying to wait for them to spawn.. but thats not all of course, if u die during the fight, you can freely start all over again, because there are no checkpoints during the fight, only at its start and end.. and the story.. thats the most laughable thing.. I can only say, that at the end of this game (I played this game once already, but when i was younger so I remembered the end), there is the totally same boss, which is at the end of painkiller battle out of hell, only this time you dont need to use some special strategy, because guess what ? SPECIAL STRATEGIES ON BOSSES ARE LAME, LETS SHOOT DAT THING MUHAHAHAHAHAAH, ye funny ♥♥♥♥ing developers.. the most funny thing althrough is, that this boss should represent the Eve, who took the Lucifers powers and became the ruler of hell.. so, you are trying to tell me that if you take lucifers powers and you are ♥♥♥♥ing woman, then you turn into exactly same demon who had the power before ??? why lucifer didnt looked like ♥♥♥♥ing Alastor when he ruled the hell then ??? ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, what can I say, ressurection was totally bugged, but at least it was fun to experience all those bugs and at least it didnt give you all weapons from the start and the fights werent frustrating and never ending.. This♥♥♥♥♥♥? I played it 25 minutes and im asking myself how could i finish this game before ? Impossible..  I was bored to death and didnt even finished the first level, because i died in the middle of fight and you know what, i dont wanna kill that 200 monster all over again.. so 0/10, no, -1/10 from me, hope this game gets deleted from steam soon.. no, not just from steam, from the universe !

												This game sucks. It is a fanmade mod for a Painkiller and it is a bad mod without any interesting idea inside. Previous fanmade Painkiller mod, Resurrection, had a lot of technical flaws and was barely playable, but it had some interesting ideas and sometimes it had nice design. But this one just sucks, developers gave up on their own ideas from Resurrection instead of developing them further - and this was a bad idea. Bad game.But if you really like to tear thounsands of monsters in one little gray room for hours - take it!			",397,156,6,92,37,3,71

												Apparently it is a bunch of fan made levels. For some reason sold as a full game. In summary, just a waste of time even to install this ""miracle"". It is totally repetitive, extremely short and deprived of any imitation of imaginativeness and ideas. It makes no sense to bother with Redemption, neither the fun will be innovative, nor it will allow you to feel any entertainment. It is better to once again reach for any of the previous Painkiller games.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												If you're a fan of the original Painkiller and it's expansion; I would not recommend this game.    Everything is recycled from the previous games with nothing really new to speak of, and it doesn't even conclude anything Black Edition set up.  The game just ends in another cliffhanger and a pretty crappy one at that. If you're interested in getting Painkiller, just go for Black Edition.  It may be $5 more, but you get infinitely more content.  This game is just a cash-in on the title and nothing more.DON'T BUY!			",163,8,1,9,8,2,6

												Love Serious Sam? Want to fight in small cramped in spaces? This is the game for you!Painkiller Redemption is just that, instead of keeping everything that made Painkiller so unique, they made it into a crappier version of Serious Sam by hurling hundreds of enemies at you at once in a small room. I have to admit, this game gives you an exhillerating feeling that few other games give you. You walk into a room and bam! Enemies appear at all angles, as you kill them, more appear and you then find yourself swarmed by massive numers of enemies. So get that rocket launcher/cannon ready. It's going to be a blood bath, no joke.Another plus is that Belial returns, sadly his legendary one-liners don't return which is a shame (i liked Belial haters can hate). On the other hand, Belial's weapon arsenal has been severely diminished, where are the eggs? The sword? Gone. B...but they were the coolest weapons in the game! Well too bad. *Sigh at least we have the nuke gun and the evil eye*.In all seriousness though, Belial might as well have been the only playable character and that's not to say that i hate Daniel (he's a badass) but moreso his weapon selection just simply don't work with this game at all. The stakegun is near useless, i don't think i ever used that thing besides the final boss fight (we'll get to that later), the shotgun is buggy as hell, for some reason when you use the freezer you can't shoot until the reload animation is finished rendering the freezer completely useless considering this game is filled with enemies, the electrodriver is back though besides the combo damage you won't find much use for it and the ever reliable rocket launcher/chaingun which is the only weapon worth a damn in this game.That leaves Daniel with only 1 weapon in his arsenal that is remotely useful and once you run out of ammo for it, let the pain begin.Belial on the other hand is a much wider arsenal which is honestly far more convenient than Daniel's, you get the ever useful cannon, the heads and quite possibly the most OP weapon in the series, the screamer. Add to that the increased fire rate of all Belial's weapon's and you have the perfect character for this game. Honestly i believe they just designed this game around Belial. Daniel only has the 5 weapons in the original Painkiller, none of his BOOH weapons return which is a shame as they'd be so useful here. Thankfully many of them return in Belial's arsenal as slightly altered re-skins which is funny because besides the evil eye, all the weapons which weren't reskins of weapons from the black edition were removed (it turns out that the evil eye uses the painkiller laser and the screamer is actually a demon morph shot essentially making them a special kind of reskin).For some reason, Bill Sherman, whilst making an appearance in the game's story, never makes an appearance in the game but then again what do you expect for a guy who uses the exact same weapons as Daniel except 1. Still having Mr. Molotov would have been interesting but then again who cared about this guy anyways?In all honesty though, this game is utterly terrible, 1000's of enemies in a single level which keep popping out in some of the smallest most cramped environments and of course the ever terrible Final Boss fight who has the tendancy to walk into walls.Allow me to make myself clear DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!Get Painkiller Black edition and if you've already played it then give Overdose a try, it's not as bad as people say and has some cool levels such as Asteroids. Painkiller Redemption on the other hand recycles Multiplayer maps so you're essentially seeing absolutely no new content here. It's basically just Painkiller Multiplayer... but without the multiplayer and 1000's of enemies. AVOID.			",65,4,0,11,2,0,3

												A mod that doesn't bring anything interesting to continue playing. I felt bored and annoyed after the countless waves of enemies spawning at each area of the levels. Sometimes I felt like the game was trolling me in the begining, where I thought I was able to progress through the next area but then my path would be blocked and more hundreds of enemies would spawn. The game can be too complex because of the small environment with limited ammunition, health, armor and depending on the difficulty level being set will make you frustrated & bored or just bored.My advice is to just play the black edition and overdose, everything else labeled painkiller seems like a dissapointment.

												For the most part painkiller games are awesome and pretty simple. You shoot, things explode and fall apart and you and up with a very satisfying face. But some of the games take that concept for granted. Much like this one. The sections are very small and the enemies that come at you is always ludicrous. The enemy types are not spawned gradually and there is not really that much ammunition for you to fight the huge hordes of enemies. It is sort of fun shooting game but nothing compared to the first.			",902,197,17,58,56,3,87

												Eggtooth vomit out a putrid sequel in the grievously named Painkiller: Redemption, missing the mark in every single way imaginable, giving the strong impression that a conscious effort was made to make this game as cheerless and boring as humanly possible. Not one single person played through the original Painkiller and thought; ""I would be enjoying this a lot more if every level was a faceless series of narrow corridors that took 40 minutes to complete due to an insane amount of enemies continually slowing me down to a grinding halt."" Yet here we have a sequel that focuses exclusively on this idea and magnifies it to gargantuan proportions. Nothing about this game works, it's almost remarkable in a morbid sort of way; a complete and utter calamity, a masterclass in monotony, the absolute apex of apathy, a soulless and cynical creation that begs the question; ""Why do you hate Painkiller fans Eggtooth?""A botched redemption that sends the series screaming down into the bowels of hell.2/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is like Painkiller Married SeriousSAM, but this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child lost its fun.  This is insane mountains of monsters teleporting into a small area for 20 mins at a time.   The first level could be walked from start to end in roughly 2 mins... it took me 50 mins to beat, so i spent 48 mins spinning in circles killing the monsters like Serious SAM, but less fun.  Its worth it if you love that sort of thing, but overall for $5.00 a worty insane FPS action game for mindless combat, but.... I'd recomend the original Painkiller 99 times out of a 100.

												On the positive side: It's not Painkiller: Ressurection. This is to say it's a stable game that will launch, run, load, and not crash every ten minutes.On the negative side: everything else. It's the ultimate in shooting the same damn enemy over and over and over again in a small featureless square room simulator.There's almost nothing to do here. No atmosphere, no new weapons, no new enemies, no new maps (they're all just multiplayer maps very, VERY poorly turned into single player maps). What little story there ever was in the painkiller series is gone. There's no voice acting to speak of. The uber obnoxious ""HUH"" noise the character makes when he jumps has been mysteriously re-added, for some reason, which was the sole saving grace of Redemption that they took that out.There's nobody playing on the multiplayer servers. The tarot cards are all so impossibly hard to get that I can assure you with 99 percent confidence you'll never see a single one except the first one. Play the game on insomniac difficulty and you'll be dead three rooms in, play it on Slumber or Daydream and you can't get souls or cards, taking essentially the only reason to play the game away from the game.Each level is the same: Spawn in a room, literally hundreds of enemies spawn with the developer having payed no mind as to the location or quantity or even model of the spawning enemies. they just CTRL+V'd the entire game. Enemies spawn on top of each other, enemies spawn on top of you, right next to you, etc. Then you shoot them. Then you go to the next room after living through ten or so waves of enemies.Yes, ten waves of enemies per room. There's no alternative rooms, no exploration, the secrets are all just♥♥♥♥♥♥easy to find because the game is soley multiplayer maps. There's nothing here. It's five dollars you would be better off buying almost anything else with.I'd almost recommend it just to see how lazy a game can get. That said, Recurring Evil exists sooooo yeah.

												Painkiller Redemption is yet another ""sequel"" to Painkiller, single-player ""old-school"" FPS. This one was once again effort of ""same fans"" as those behind Resurrection and this time it also throws away multiplayer mode that no one would play anyway. Oh, and it was released in 2011, 7 years after original game. And it still uses old engine. And this time it becomes clear that developers wanted your money with zero effort.Technically, game engine still works. It can support widescreen. Hud is still stretched this way. Performance is good, loading times are good. Bugs and crashes are low, aside from Tarot Cards. Any attempts to equip Tarot Cards resulted in fatal error. Not that you would care about cards anyway.Storyline tells you about heroes of Painkiller and Overdose going to kill surprise villian, Ada, from Battle Out Of Hell. And it doesn't have anything interesting and it's only given through text at the end and beggining. Not even final boss, who is just reuse of final boss from BOOH, has anything to do with story. It really feel unrelated. Will not enjoy cutscenes either, as said, it's just text.The only thing it does is stealing good story arc from potential proper sequel and trying to tell you that nightmare that is ""resurrection"" is canon with hero of that game appearing for no reason in a text, doing nothing good.So, let's get to ripping and telling you what exactly this game is about.Imagine that you are trying to put as little effort into creating Painkiller sequel just to sell something. You take Deathmatch maps from original Painkiller. It doesn't bother you that they are small and have no points of interest, being designed to allow players focus on killing each other. You just start placing enough of stuff to make it count as single-player level, just putting small details, that are boxes, here and there. You import weapons and monsters from previous Painkiller expansion packs and then you start to set off spawn. Since you want it to last few hours, you just insert 1000~ monsters into each level. Pretty much, you make it so player has to spend in each room 5-10 minutes, setting up spawns. Here and there you try to vary gameplay with sniping enemies. And then your commisioned generic metal music finally arrives, you hook it up and put a pricetag on your masterpiece.Well, at least that's the way I imagine it went. So yes, lazy DM maps were edited and it spawns hordes in each rooms, making wave appear one after another until you get bored. Actually, no, it keeps spawning them even after you got bored. Not many players got past the first level. The only bright idea is that some levels make you use Painkiller game weapons (no, weapons from BOOH aren't included). Another half makes you use Overdose arsenal (minus two guns). Not that it matters.And thus you got a horde gameplay right there. Here is a way that you play it:1) Bunnyhop around until all enemies spawn and form a group. Try not to get too bored by collecting souls in meanwhile.2) Shoot rocket/explosive into group.3) Repeat back to step 1.Now do it until you beat the game, while wondering that you could be playing better games in meanwhile.The only difference between two heroes is that Belial (Overdose) got three anti-horde fire modes, one being good for tight hallways. Daniel (Painkiller) got only one, that is rocket, and nothing effective for tight hallways where you don't have space to bunnyhop around. Which will be the only interesting part. Unless you got enough ammo for rockets, then it doesn't matter anyway.Erm, no, it's not old-school. Old-school FPS weren't just about gore, you had mazes, interesting encounters and, well, thinking. And don't say ""As good as Serious Sam"", that game handles horde/arena genre better than most notice. You can't just bunnyhop around there, melee monsters will catch up and beat you up, you actually have to respect monsters and do things depending on sitatuation. Painkiller Redemption on other hand doesn't require even situation awareness. Just do same thing unless you want to run out of ammo.That, and spending 30 minutes killing 1000 monsters on tiny levels that don't have any points of interest would still be too dragged anyway.And it still has demon mode, which you will get into after collecting 66 souls. You surely will actiavate it more often here, but since it slows down time, it will not do job better than rocket into horde. And yea, you can still collect Tarot Cards, if you want to do painful objectives like ""use only melee weapon and shotgun"" here. You can still use only 1 passive and only 1 ""on-use"" card. It also may crash the game.Painkiller Ressurrection, previous work of this developer, had some ideas, but also was extremly broken from technical side. Painkiller Redemption isn't as broken, but it just has no soul. It doesn't even try to be unique or anything original, it just says ""look, I have horde and gore"" and reuses assets in such way that gameplay becomes extremely repetetive and bland. Don't bother, it's the worst.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												Pretty bad level design even for a fan game. Each level consists of featureless box-like cramped areas, and each area has 100-200 spawns. It's gets really tedious fast since you have to spend maybe 5-10 minutes clearing every box.			",390,50,5,39,12,6,50

												Not to bad, but not to good either. For me, this one is the worst painkiller I've played so far. One of the things I liked about Painkiller Ressurection is that for the first time you had the chance to strategicallly use the scenario in order to succeed, and you had plenty of enemies to defeat. Well, that option was totaly eliminated in this game and you can't do too much against an army of a 1000 minions in such small maps. Putting 1000 enemies in each level is good, but not when the map doesn't have enough space for all the folks to play.Beating this game on trauma is traumatic and frustrating, so the name suits it. It took me over 20 hours to finish 8 tiny level and I am pretty sure I did it with 90% luck and 10% skill in most of the situations.Anyway, I still recommend the game if you like the , and especially if you have played all the ones before Redemption. Playing this one first can make you hate the series and you end up not trying any of the others.It's a 4/10 for me.			",56,15,2,5,8,1,14

												Still not as terrible as Resurrection, but still not much fun. Cramped levels (all of them based on multiplayer maps from older Painkiller games) with waves after waves of monsters spawning in slowly - this just gets old really fast.  Still very evocative of Doom or Quake (and, indeed, the original Painkiller), but that's all it's got going for it. Play those other games instead.			",230,72,5,12,10,2,12

												Hands down the most boring painkiller game. Possibly the worst, even put beside Painkiller: Ressurection. I have never played a game that has consistantly bored me on the first level so much to the point that after years of owning the game I have made zero progress.The game locks you up in a small room and just unleashes wave after wave after wave, just never ending like its some sort of really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mini-game you would find in some other, any other better game. I have never been bored so quickly as to lose all motivation or care to even proceed past the first ♥♥♥♥ing level.This is a landmark in worthlessness.			",416,55,4,40,24,2,32

Same goes for the weapons.Nothing wrong with them, just nothing new.The final boss was a joke.I would only recommend this game to players who have already finished 'Black Edition' and 'Overdose', which are much much better games.

												Be warned this game is a fanmade product meant only for real hardcore FPSers! As I’m not one of those i had hard time to progress.This game is the absolute opposite of the cursed Painkiller:Resurrection. Again only a few levels (6+2bonus? the boss is on the 6th) but because every of them features around a thousand enemies compressed into small areas you won’t miss action in here. Practically the levels consist of a series of survival rooms and they are hard as hell. I wasn’t able to make it through the first level on normal, had to lower the difficulty into the very lowest (no cards or souls), even if I knew i won’t see the ending not even half of it, maybe a black screen featuring a short text „You are a miserably weak player :P”. Actually i saw the ending but it’s not a big thing, this game is not about story. Furthermore I did not regret the difficulty decrease after i saw the levels after. The second level is a pain (in some dark warm smelly place), shooting enemies spawn 2-3 at a time, and every of them start with a shot, giving you no chance to beat them before they hurt you. On later levels the rooms become smaller with the same amount of enemies, sometimes i really wondered how those could be beaten normally as the real usable crowdcontrol weapons, the stakegun-grenade, the xbow-bouncies or the rocket launcher cannot be used in such claustrophobic places without seriously hurting yourself.No new content at all, but it features most weapons and enemies from all its ancestor Painkillers. The levels seems to me as multiplayer levels recycled into a single player nightmare. When i started I had fear what I will find after the awfull Resurrection but the game started good. Lower your expectations and forget about exploration and other nerdy things in this one, it’s mindless pure action! Think of this one as the action essence of the original game.Later on i found it must be impossible to carry on with higher difficulties and it started to bore and annoy me. At the very end i again started to enjoy the game but i’m sure you need a special mood to find delight in this continous massacre.4/10  - Pure extreme hard, room survival FPS action. Fun when depressed.(Sorry for my English!)			",908,272,23,118,57,7,145

												I really like the original Painkiller, but Redemption is repetitive in comparison and everyone who previously played PK probably already knows what this means. The gameplay is pretty much what you've come to expect from Painkiller.1. Enter a room2. Shoot!3. ProfitIn this game however every encounter drags on for ages. You barely move forward in this game and the levels look very much the same.  ",586,145,39,80,64,7,85

												Pros:Return of Daniel and Belial, including their weapons (you'll have them back in level 1).Heavy metal music, just my kind of music while killing monsters!MORE MONSTER KILLING!Cons:Level 1 escalated too quickly, but nonetheless its still fun and not too hard once you know your combat strategy.Tarot card glitched when bought which can lead to your game to crash, if you encounter it make sure you unlock another. That way you will be able to buy it. It works for me.Overall:Game is amazing, its somewhat a mix up between the first 3 Painkiller games where the map design was as it is (not very open area like Resurrection). While like Resurrection, it has many monsters. Though this has more than Resurrection.Levels are short, but the monster killing carnage should keep you going. Though I do wish theres more levels, and I actually was getting it on killing monsters while enjoying the music too which gives off adrenaline that makes you wanna kill monsters more and fast.Get it if you are up for some crazy mindless shooting.

												This game loads on my computer, but locks it up on trying to play the actual game. Been asked to do several things to make it work, but still will not. Save your money, this game has issues!			",11,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game kind of sucks. It's literally just a bunch of multiplayer maps crammed full of enemies. The original Is far better. Overdose is better. At the very least, it's shorter then Resurrection, which was possessed of painfully long and poorly-designed levels. But Redemption adds literally nothing new to the mix. There are no new enemies and no new weapons, and the maps themselves are exceedingly bland. There isn't even any dialogue, and the cutscenes are just text scrawls with still art of the characters. Given it's release so long after that of the original Painkiller, it kind of just feels like a weak attempt to make more money off the original's legacy and frankly, it's kind of insulting how mediocre it is.

												At least this is better than Painkiller: Resurrection. However, the levels here are really small (they based off of the multiplayer levels from the original) and you face wayyy too many enemies in each area that it ends up becoming extremely cramped. Because of the huge amount of enemies, you will constantly find yourself fighting the same enemies over and over and over again which becomes extremely tedious and boring.			",859,168,54,73,40,5,93

												LOVE LVOE LOVE this game and all the Painkiller series.  Started playing this game on origional Xbox when it came out. amazing nostalgic train track FPS.  DOOM and Duke Nukem for origional Windows style game...better graphics but thats the feel i got from the game playing it brought me back to those games back in the day.  if you want a fun old school FPS that will give you a jump and a fright now and then this game is perfect.

												At this point I can tell this series just gave up and i probably won't even try ""Painkiller: Recurring Evil"". Creating smaller maps but throwing hundreds more enemies into them does not make the game more intense, it just makes it down right annoying. End verdict on this whole series: Buy Painkiller:Black Edition and Overdose, don't bother with the others they aren't worth your time.			",540,88,20,60,52,7,69

												This is a tough review. So the game changes by adding waves of monsters after you, with no cutscenes. I enjoy wrecking everyone, but gameplay is repetitive after awhile. Not to mention you get few levels. Less exploration. This game is still better than the previous installment and happens after the previous installment. 6/10. Very close to not recommending this, but the funny ragdolls what made this decent.			",276,24,5,43,18,2,34

												This game sucks for the reasons every other sane review has already mentioned: It simply locks you in a boring room and throws one wave after another of boring enemies at you. I didn't make it past the first level, because the boredom just numbed me into apathy.It's PAINfully obvious that this was created by modders. These idiots never have a clue how to make anything decent. They either make it too difficult, too boring, too repetitive, or some combination thereof. I'll grant you, creating a good game is not easy. This is no excuse. Creating a good car is not easy, either. Do these modders make vehicles that they sell? I doubt it. Well, STOP SELLING HORRIBLE GAMES THAT ARE TOO AWFUL FOR CONSUMPTION AS WELL!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a very fun game to mow down creatures, it is fun if you like violent and fps shooters, dont underestimate this game like i did. When i first played it i made fun of it and now I enjoy ad love the game. To be honest i got it for $0.66 it was worth, i would say if you are bored it is a good game to buy for $5.00, so that is my response!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bloody fun! A game that doesnt require a story line to have fun. The game drops you right into the heart of battle with about 8 intresting weapons that would strike fear into the enemies, if they had ones or were alive. 10/10 I recommend this game			",62,3,0,1,2,1,3
