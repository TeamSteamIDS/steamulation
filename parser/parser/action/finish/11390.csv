												Buggy mess...but for 69p......bargin, i think the bugs are funny, nice car models and the game doesnt take it self too seriously, I laughed my balls off at the guy putting on the u.s. accent with the voice acting, Game is fun and thats what it aimed for and ive had plenty of laughs from it, you get a sense of speed, lots of cars i just dont get why someone would give this a thumbs down because its great, graphics are nice and it even runs on my crap laptop. Not sure about the price but on sale you def gotta pick this one up just to laugh at the bugs or the fact that you chase bad guys smashing up there cars as a policeman. Like i said, nice graphics, good sound, great fps and lots of cars, freeroam, slowmo crashes, missions and bugs... a steal if its on sale trust me.Overall 6.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just gave this game a try since it pretends to be an ""open-world driving game"", and that got me curious. Alas, after just over one hour of trying to come to grips with it, I have to admit I give up on it. It's not an awfully bad game, far from it. The graphics are more than decent, considering it's a game from 2009. On the highest settings (not that there are that many settings...), the cars look nice and the environment is more or less ok - bar the awful pop-ups in front of you of several objects. The driving model is fair, nothing special, but when played with a controller it feels fine. The music, as so often with this type of game, is all too repetitive for my taste so I switched it almost immediately off. There are some possibilities for adding your own music tracks to the game, so for those interested in this, the game offers something extra.The bad thing about the game is the ""gameplay"" - actually, there hardly is any, at least I did not find much of it. There are several modes: a free patrol mode, in which I searched in vain for anything to-do other than driving through a generic-looking city with roadsigns that kept saying ""Köln 2300m"" all the time. You can do a normal city race, which is fine for just a quick try, but the ""story mode"" is what lets the game down. The various objectives are simply hilariously difficult - most of the time one has to damage an opponent to 100%, but whenever he gets further away than 200m, the mission has to be restarted. Since the AI miraculously can teleport itself down bridges or through walls, this got me first staring in disbelief and then lauging out loud. I guess this game can be fun to some, but to me it's a no-go: there are simply too many other good games out there, including large-scale racing games, to put any more time into this.Overall score: 3.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""I don't have any argument but I don't like it !"" -Bad reviews from a random lowbob. 0/10""Like Skyrim with Polizei."" -IGN 2/10""Polizei, oktoberfest, ausfarht, dummkopfs."" -Medic 11/10So, first of all, this game doesn't deserve all those bad reviews. Everyone seems to have played this game for only 15 minutes, and honestly, you can't judge a game within 15 minutes. This game reviews are clearly manichaean ; you have two possibilities according to Steam reviews : you completly disregarded it because you played a few minutes and no minigun spawned on your car or you will find this game ""somewhat OK"". In my honest opinion, I really liked this game. Of course, there is tons of better game in that game style, like the FlatOut series, but this game got a decent amount of pros. Let me make a list of the pros, the cons and the neutrals.Pros :+ Graphism ; Considering it has been released in 2008-2009.+ Soundtrack ; Brutal and powerful, one of the best metal and hard rock soundtrack I listened in a videogame.+ Cars ; Despite the huge load of germans cars, you can still find a great american Dodge Ram SRT 10 called the Pick-up T2. ['Murica intensifies]+ Gameplay ; Easy, fast and fluid.+ Open World ; ""Like GTA, you know ?""+ Splitscreen ; 4 players Polizei-Ausfahrt-Party. + Race gamemod ; Chaos and destruction.+ Damage physics ; Pretty decent.Neutrals :~ Based on the German TV show Alert for Cobra 11 ; I don't have a strong opinion, some will say this is a great show.~ Storyline ; ""Chef : Cobra 11, I choose you !"" ""Semir&Ben : OMG God Bless Germany !"" ""Enemies : I am having a heart attack ! *die*"".~ Voice acting ; It's really bad, I admit but you need to consider the budget they got to do this game.Cons :- Lack of clarity and ingame messages ; This game isn't for the lazy ones, you need the ability to easily figure out what's going on and what's the objectives. The less ressourful people will dislike this game.- Bad staging ; Yes, considering there's no cutscene or models for the characters, they did what they could.- Advices ; They should show the utility of the Action key in some missions. Futhermore, when you choose a place to do your patrol, check if the car you chose got a red flag next to its name. It means, you have a mission to do, and this car is allowed.TL;DR, I really appreciate this game. However, don't think this game is incredible like a Grand Theft Auto. And please, if you buy it, don't be one of those bad players making bad reviews with only 15 minutes played.→ 80/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A few hours was enough for me to find some things to do (here's a screenshot of me doing something. It involves me running over and gathering NPC vehicles). I also enjoyed how you could actually (kind of) destroy things.Overall, it's a good game. Has free roam, places to explore, and things to destroy. I'd probably get it when it's cheap though (or in my case, when it's free).Unexpectedly had fun, 10/10 (for realism, of course).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is definitely not the best racing game out there, but I am not going to compare a game that I paid $1 for with $60 games. For $1, I got hours of action packed, intense races and chases. I have played the story for 16 hours and I'm not even done yet. The graphics are pretty good and the handling is realistic. The dialogues are cheesy and the missions are somewhat cliche, but don't let that stop you from buying this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game materialized in my library one day. I never purchased it, it was just there. I installed it out of boredom and expected the game to be no better than those ""X SIMULATOR"" games you see here on Steam. I was pleasantly mistaken, because this game, despite being made on an almost non-existent budget, is surprisingly solid. What the game lacks in originality, presentation, and innovation, it makes up for with solid controls, and really great vehicle physics. There's a fair amount of attention to detail here, too. Your car, and every other car in the game as well, can be absolutely smashed into an ugly mess, with way more convincing looking damage than what GTA IV and V have to offer. You can park in front of a train, let it smash your car's front grille in, go flying, land, and not be able to control your car at all because your front wheels are now several feet away racing eachother down the autobahn without you. The gameplay is pretty generic and repetitive, but still solid. You'll get bored eventually, but until then you'll have fun chasing criminals, smashing into everything, and racing. Traffic will move the ♥♥♥♥ out of your way when you turn on your sirens, and when you finally catch up to the bad guys and P.I.T. them into a wall, you'll have to hold them still there for a few seconds in order to ""arrest"" them. There's things to collect and vehicles to unlock, including an excavator and a massive armored personnel carrier with six wheels, which absolutely smashes everything out of its way including buses and large trucks, even in oncoming traffic. All of the cars are unlicensed rip-offs of real world vehicles, which I'm glad the developers managed to do. It's not a BMW, it's a Semir! They're different! We swear!All in all, it's a solid game. It's not the best game in the world, but it's definitely not bad either. It's just decent. A 5/10, or I guess 7.5/10 if you go by IGN's rating system. If you like racing and police chase games, and don't mind games with low budgets, pick this one up on sale.The developers of this game, sadly, stopped making video games in 2014. They were very well known in Germany, but virtually nobody knows about them outside of Germany. They specialized in racing games and their games were some of the best selling games to come out of Germany. Rest in peace Synetic, and if you guys are reading this, I loved World Racing 2 on the Xbox.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is...this game...the mechanics of the driving and all are actually pretty enjoyable, and the graphics are pretty decent too. The UI and voice acting leave a little to be desired, but I can live with that. But the missions, the missions, the missions are just unredeemably awful. If this had just been a normal racing game, I would have liked it, but the attempt at open-worldiness is half-baked at best and doesn't improve the game whatsoever. The missions are so finnicky that it's very easy to instantly end up in a position where it becomes unbeatable, and with the complete lack of checkpoints this means you're going to be doing a lot of restarting, doing the same boring stuff over and over and over again. Staying at just the right distance from another car isn't fun, at least as implemented here. And after playing this game for an hour, I didn't get into a single race, which was what I was looking for in the first place. I feel like this game has the makings of a really great low-budget Burnout, but they instead went for some police angle that just doesn't work at all, either thematically or mechanically.

												Picked this up in a Steam sale long gone by and really didn't give this the time of day.  After TDU2 was in the mood for more mission base driving which CTII does quite nicely.  Nice graphics engine and alot of detail in the environment make CTII a pleasure to look at and at 60FPS.  Missions are limited to what you can do with a game like this. There are multiple difficulty levels.  It's been quite sometime but the game sort of reminds me of Wreckless, the mission based racer for the Xbox.  The primary career mode encompasses the exploits of 2 of Germanys finest though there is a Case structure for replayability and picking up past the 1st stage of a multiple stage Case, a welcome feature giving that I've played too many games that make you start from scratch.  There is a race mode where you can set up parameter based race events.  These include all of the vehicles in the game including semi's which no doubt leave a path of destruction.  A great value for the price paid and a fun game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I actually really loved this game. I bought it mainly because it was on offer but I'm having no regrets over it. It's fun and enjoyable and appeals to my need to drive a police car around pointlessly on blues. The voice overs aren't great but the storyline is pretty interesting. Up until I got stuck on a mission where you need to pointlessly jump onto a building roof to get to a helicopter that is pretty much impossible, I enjoyed it. There are some bugs and some vehicles will jump around like crazy making missions all that more difficult if not impossible. But overall, I loved the game and think that I'll probably end up spending many more hours playing it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Crash Time II Review - Rating: 7.8/10General ImpressionCrash Time II is a pretty nice action-racing game. Do not trust the ""Mixed"" rating, the game is actually pretty good. The graphics and the textures are pretty nice and well-designed. Considering the fact that RTL Interactive had a small budget for this game, the graphics really are a pretty positive point for this game. The atmosphere happens in a fictional German city. The city is divided into several years, where you will have to patrol or to resolve cases, in function of the game mode you have chosen. The audio is pretty nice, I like the sounds of the vehicles. The music is decent, there isn’t anything special about it. The voice acting… is pretty terrible. It has been created superficially. The gameplay is relatively an open-world style, but the missions of it… they are boring sometimes, the developers didn’t concentrate on the gameplay very much. The story is also pretty uninteresting, 2 men have to complete the tasks given by the police. Nothing very special. The user interface is well-optimized, with no bugs and a pretty nice design. For less resourceful people, this game will be a pain: the user-interface has little information about the missions, therefore you need to figure out yourself, from the dialogues and from the environment circumstances. The controls are neat. The engines are alright, I haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are pretty sophisticated, everything around moves nicely, especially your cars’ movements/breaks/crashes. Overall, Crash Time II is a pretty nice action-racing game, with nice graphics, atmosphere and mechanics, which combines crashes and explosions with high speeds, but which needs improvement on the gameplay and on the voice acting.Positive PointsPretty nice and well-designed graphics and texturesPretty nice audio and pretty nice musicRelatively fun and challenging gameplayMany missions throughout the patrols & cases available 3 difficulties availableA pretty nice designed user interface, but it lacks of a lot of useful informationOpen-World gameplay alikeSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsNeutral PointsSteam achievements and trading cards would improve the gameThe free-roam feature should be available from the beginning of the gameNegative PointsThis negative point is only available for people with less spirit of orientation: if you need tips, or exact locations where to start the mission, you will have a hard time with this game. The game should have had implemented a feature which enables or disables tipsIn my opinion, there are not enough race-type missionsThe voice acting is pretty terribleThe developers tried to make a pretty nice story, however it is not that kind of a good story, it is pretty uninteresting ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crash Time 2 is a series of games based on the German police drama ""Alarm for Cobra 11: Autobahn Police"". There was actually several games made under the Cobra 11 brand, then came Cobra 11 Nitro. However, none of these was exported. Next version, Cobra 11: Crash Time was exported  as ""Crash Time"", and that lead to the Crash Time II, and so on. (We're now up to Crash Time V). At its heart, Crash Time is an open-world mission-based driving sim with a fictional city for you to drive around in using variety of vehicles. CT2 has a good selection of German vehicles, none with actual names and logos, but they are readily recognizable, plus a few favorite foreign cars. The graphics are actually quite good, giving the amount of detail available for the cities and buildings. Some multilevel garages can be driven to the roof and back down via the spiral ramps. the Autobahns are nice and wide with plenty of places to speed, and many cars have nitrous injection added for that extra burst of power. The mission, on the other hand, are your typical police chase (either stop the car or crash him into toally disabled), checkpoint race (reach X checkpints, stop for 1 second in each), getaway (don't let the bad guys catch you), time trial (reach the destination via specified route before time runs out). CT2, however, added ""jumping puzzles"", where you must take the ramp at certain speeds to ensure you jump correctly onto certain locations in order to do something you can't do otherwise. And sometimes you need to chain the driving and jumping together, and that is just ridiculous. For example, one of the missions was ""stop that barge from dumping waste into the canal"" How do you do it? By taking ramps and JUMPING onto the barge (without falling into the canal, of course). That requires jumping across the canel, landing on the other side, make a left, jump ANOTHER ramp, then stop right on top of the barge (without falling off). All in... 45 seconds. ARGH! The city is large enough and open enough that ""free roam"" is quite possible Indeed, you are encouraged to ""patrol"" the city for missions to advance the campaign. Though in reality you just need to respawn at the regular start spots and few times, and/or scroll around the city map (fully zoomable in 3D!) for a ""red arrow"" which means mission starting point. Handling of the cars are simplified, and are exciting without being overly difficult. The campaign missions, however, have the dubious honor of having some of the WORST English dubbing done EVER in a game. The two voice actors are either very bored or acting too hard. Though this seem to reflect the type of TV show this was based on: more of action comedy than pure action. If you can find this game cheap, it is worth a try at least. It's not NFS: Hot Pursuit, but it has its own charms.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only having played 30 minutes in the game I'd like to say , well done. Well , you're a cop and try to take down assailants with your car in a high speed chase around the city. I dont remember how i got this game , but in no effect does it justify its store price. Only buy this if you're drunk or its free.The handling is actually better than need for speed rivals . Handbraking feels solid and destroying traffic lights and civilian cars opts in a title as collateral damage and adds up in euros. The game has 2 main protagonists. What's his name and his friend. They are cops and you , propably , are the one driving. Now, i did a mission where you had to stay for 5 seconds next to a truck and your passenger cop friend ""jumps"" on board it in order to take the wheel. After doing so , my cop car still had him as a passenger throughout the completion of the task. Now , when i noticed it , after a while ... i sighed. Not in dissapointment , but as in a weird feeling you have saying "" How did the developers miss that?"" You maybe are saying, this is a cheap♥♥♥♥♥old game. Sure, but it has actually VOICE ACTING. Yes , it does. And, you guessed right !  It is terrible.Anyway, like I said. Purchase when drunk.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A really good case of 'Don't judge a game by it's looks'. This game may look low budget and it might be but I'd have to hand it to the devs for making such a great fun little game on a low budget. I've been looking for a good mission based racing game ever since I played The Simpsons: Hit & Run (Which I loved) and this really brought me back to when I first played it. It has some great missions ranging from escaping and smashing crooks of the road to high speed autobahn races. The graphics hold up very well for it's age and the open world is of a decent size. Cars handle great and there are plenty to unlock along the way. This was such a surprise since I got this for free and has definitely got me wanting Crash Time 3 here on steam. I hope the other games find their way onto steam someday too. 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If I had to compare Crash Time I would say a cross between Flatout and GTA driving controls. The driving scheme is interesting, and the damage portion is not as accurate or as hard hitting as Flatout, but does give satisfaction when you hit a car at a solid speed and the instant replay starts playing (one of the features of the game). The voice acting isn't as bad as everyone says (it's just the pauses between the voices that are weird). The gameplay itself is not bad. The game involves a lot of running around, doing missions, knocking these guys out while protecting these guys that sort of bit. Some missions are ridiculously hard and require a lot of replays (some missions can get meticulous). What's interesting is you can flick on your emergency lights, put on hazard lights, put on your turn signals - so if you like driving by the law in GTA this may be for you.Realistically speaking though the game provides its moments of fun and overall is playable and enjoyable. As for outstanding... not so much. It seems there are opportunities where it could have been, but it missed it's glory. For a game that I bought under two bucks... I think it's about worth it.You do get a decent game at least.RATING : 6.75/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now this isn't the best racing simulator out there, but it's a great game to play when you have nothing to do or would like to pass time. I do admit the missions can become repetitive and the voice acting is far from great but the gameplay itself isn't half bad. I wouldn't buy this game at full price as it's not worth it at £6.99 as there are better games out there for the money. But, I managed to buy this game whilst it was on a discount so I'm not too fused about the price.Overall, this games suits certain people and their taste in racing games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I got this game for free some website so giving it away, was sitting in my gameslist for like 2 months so I today installed it and this game turns out it really good, but I wouldn't pay the full  price, I would only buy this on a sale. This game is sort of based on a german cop show, well it has their characters in it and them voice acting and they're the main characters in the game. So its fun, Lots of missions, 4 Hours in and I still have not finished it and I've only been doing missions. The game has weird controls but when you get used to them they're fine. Urm... Pros: Fun.Long story.Funny-ish diaglog.Cons:Non-licsened cars. pretty dispointing for a car game.Controls - Really Hard to get use to.Missions. - Because the missions work on a basist that you ethier drive to them or get them on the radio, but only certain vechiles can get them at a time, and sometimes you have to go look for the missions which the game didn't really explain.Tortuial - (Or however you spell it) Its very trickly because you mess up you have to restart a big chunck of it, same with the missions.Overall rating. 6/10 Buy Or Not Buy : Buy on sale.

Product received for free
												I don't know why...But I really enjoy the game. I like the open world, the (really) huge number of cars (and some other vehicles; e.g. a cart or a forklift), the okay graphics and damage models as well as the property damage counter of course ;)The story is okay, and even after the story you still have stuff to do as the parts of a cool vehicle are spread over the whole map to find, finding all of them will unlock it.You can pick the game up for about a buck since there was a giveaway for it; I received the Steam key for the game there, so I mark this as a product I got for free, but I actually played the game on CD-ROM before owning it on Steam - So my playtime is definitly more in reality.

												Crash Time 2 is a very enjoyable game. It's not without bugs, but I think the experience is certainly fun enough to warrant fighting through those.Visually, it's fantastic, and I had no framerate issues at all running with max graphics on my GTX760 (1680x1050 fullscreen). The cars have great damage models—you can literally knock the wheels off your car, and you will actually feel it. Knock off both your front wheels, and you can't steer anymore and must reset your car. I really liked that touch.The missions are fun and varied. Even if you do similar things in some missions, they tweak the mechanics enough that you never feel like it's completely monotonous. Driving the RC cars (bomb detonators) is particularly fun.The world is HUGE, and it's a lot of fun to explore. Granted, there aren't really ""side missions"", but it's fun to just drive around nonetheless. There were quite a few moments where I went off drops at max speed, and it gave me a real sense of adrenaline flying through the air (fortunately no one was around to mock me shouting, ""Woah!!"")The story is interesting enough to keep you engaged, but it won't win any awards. The same is true for the voice acting. For a racing game, it's probably slightly above par.A good selection of cars are available, and you can pick and choose the cars you use for some missions (though certain missions can only be performed with certain cars). They have completely different feels to them, but for the most part, you're going to want to stick with the faster vehicles for most missions.I paid $0.99 for the game, and I would honestly have been happy paying $5 for it. I definitely recommend it.The downsides to this game are the bugs, and here those are (with recommended workarounds if available):- On ""wreck the car"" missions, if you flip the opponent's car over, the car disappears and respawns somewhere near you (the same thing that your car would do if it got stuck upside down). If the opponent's car happens to respawn behind you, that means it will likely turn around and drive the other way. I recommend doing your best to not flip over the cars or completely pin them where they can't move. Just keep hitting them with force or get them behind you then keep bumping them as they try to pass you.- Sometimes, it's just plain hard to find a mission. You drive around for a while and nothing appears. In these cases, try switching cars (look for ones with mission indicators), and try switching starting locations. You shouldn't ever need to be driving around for more than a minute for the mission brief to play, so keep moving about until a mission appears. Annoying, but workable.- The navigation arrow is absolutely useless sometimes. It will recommend jumps over bridges when your car isn't fast enough to make the jump. Fortunately, the mini-map has a much better direction indicator that adjusts for different routes and recommends shortcuts. I highly recommend using that primarily (even though you have to look off the screen a bit).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I crashed into a train at around 200MPH. Left almost no damage on my car.10/10 - Would try to commit suicide again.--But seriously, this game is not that bad. It's not a GOOD game, but it'll make you laugh! I gurantee it.The graphics for a 2009 game are actually pretty decent, the voice acting is so cheesy you'll either love it or hate it.The music and sound effects are decent. It's an overall all DECENT game.(I got it for free, so I can't really complain either.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This may be one of the best bad games I've played for awhile.  And it IS bad.  The mission design (and voice acting) appears to have been coded by brain-damaged bonobo apes.  Missing scripting is beyond awful with incredibly rigid and linear requirements that allow ZERO variation, NPC AI is absolutely terrible, enemy cars can absorb ludicrous amounts of damage and -here's the best part- whereas in ANY other GTA-style game, flipping a car on its roof will kill it...  in this game, it causes them to respawn, sometimes 100m+ away from you or on another road entirely.  If you're playing a mission where staying close is a requirement, ""pitting"" a car can literally cause an instant fail situation.However...  The graphics are pretty decent, it runs at a good framerate, the city environment is nice, the car handling is good enough, and the crash modeling is actually really damn fun.So, basically, if you can pick it up for a buck or two (or in a bundle, like I did) it's honestly good for a few hours just screwing around and making things go BOOM real good.  However, any attempt to actually p[lay the game as intended or advance through the missions is almost certain to cause incredulity, ironic laughter, or loud swearing at the brain-damaged bonobos who put this thing together.   And for the love of Bob don't pay more than a couple bucks for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow I have to say I'm impressed. I got this game for almost nothing and I expected nothing from it, and got a very pleasant  surprise. The pictures is really how the game looks, its pretty. Gta 4 should have looked like this. The missions are pretty fun: chasing, escort, stopping a vehicle, RC car bombing with a little side story to every misson. The voice actors were probably tired of got minimum wage, because there are few passionate dialoges. Too bad there isn't a campaign just series of missions with no connections to each other, and the menu system looks like an early 2000's freeware games'.I think its worth a try even if it has no tradecard (yet)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is going to be a review for 3 different potential buyers:1. The buyer, who has not played this game before and has the equipment and money to play most modern-ish gamesThis game has its good moments, but it really has nothing unique that you wouldn't find anywhere else. If you're still interested in this bad-comedy-action type racing game, may I suggest later titles from this franchise.2. The nostalgia buyerYou might be pretty tempted to buy this old 'gem', especially since its price gets pretty darn low on sales. Before you add this to your cart, let me just mention some of the issues I encountered:*I don't remember the non-Steam version having frequent framerate issues. This does. Most notably on the edges of the map, but they happen pretty much all over the place. And I don't mean drops by just a couple of frames. I'm talking about motion sickness level nosedives.*Speaking of frame rates, I averaged about 38-40 fps, with 1920x1080 resolution and all other graphics settings on the lowest possible setting. I don't know if that's a sign that this port is badly optimized or that my computer is sh*ttier than I had previously thought. For reference, I can play project cars on medium settings with the same resolution and almost never go below 60fps. Not really an issue other than I'm a bit spoilt.*You still have to grind through the bland story missions to gain access to the good cars*In my case, it didn't really provide the entertainment I thought it was going to deliver. After 10 hours you've completely depleted the game and it has nothing more to offer you. That doesn't mean I didn't have fun, but the framerate issues were the things that killed it for me.Ultimately, it's your choice..3. The buyer, who has not played this before, but can't really run or afford any better quality alternativesI think the story and voice acting are irrelevant to this type of game. Sure they are bad, but I think it was intentional. It would be worse, if they tried to make it serious and ultimately failed at that. And it's not even that annoying. Besides, you should be able to skip most dialogue. Anyway, you are realistically buying this for the action stuff, and as far as that is concerned, it is very solid. Some cars are even a joy to drive. Great for creating low budget action sequences, if that's a thing you're interested in. And when it costs under a euro, it's a steal. Would recommend.Thus ends the review			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A decent game for the 99p I got it for, graphics, driving mechanics and... well nothing else is good. The driving is great and is pretty near perfect, and the graphics are brilliant for a game that is so under the radar. But, everything else is bad, the voice acting, the open world attempt and the weird damage total. The damage total counts the damage you've caused to property, it doesn't work the prices are off, 24 euros for taking out a strret sign and 3000 euros for hitting a wall and doing no damage. The controls are another issue, there are no remapping options (as I can find) and playing with the arrow keys is annoying. Overall I would recommend this game but I would ssay do not get it unless it is under £2			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now to start I bought this game for my brother’s account a while back, and i of course played it once and a while. So when the game was on sale for 99 cents I decided to bite the bullet and buy an old game that my brother and I used to enjoy. Now to say the least I have played allot and i mean allot of racing games and car/truck sim's that are out there, and to say this is one of my favorites is a lie. For starters the overall graphics of this game are not bad for the games time period, though graphics don’t make a game what it is. The story line; well there isn’t a story line it’s just a bunch of missions thrown together with shabby characters and some really bad voice acting. Split screen is ok if you have someone to play with other wise no online multiplayer as far as i see. The Open world aspect of the game is not bad at all, though seems like its a cross between a car sim and a burn out paradise type of racing game. The car mechanics aren’t horrible but definitely not the best. Now one thing I would have to give them is the body physics of the car, even though they are not soft body they still put allot of over racing games body physics to shame. Final verdict is if you want a game that you can waste some time in then buy it when it goes on sale otherwise I would stay away from it. 5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After seeing some reviews (and realizing I have a racing game), I did the first mission. I may have had the settings wrong, because I hardly can see my speedometer at all. I am pretty sure that I did have it in the right resolution, but didn't enable the widescreen option. Do I want to open it up again?Hahahaha, no way. I've already buckled my seatbelt, as my directional coordinator has done as well. Did you know that he turns the same direction as you steer it? You're not getting us out of that ditch with your steering wheel mimicing, Jimmy.Going past that, it was an okay mission. But that's not where it kept me in, because I was in it for the destruction of the game. I played many roles, like ""The man who can't help but drive into objects."", or ""Road Conqueror: You are on the wrong side of the road!!!"".My personal favorite is when I drove on the train tracks trying to get away from the train. It worked for a while, until I came to a literal slab of concrete in the train tunnel. When I saw that, I wondered if they didn't want the trains to use it, and had an alternate route. Let's just say that I was very wrong as I slammed into it.I crashed pretty hard, and the cutscene thought it was funny to replay it. That feature was bogus, especially when you are on the controller. Good thing I knew about the escape key, or else I'd have to suffer listening to the intro part of the mission. (or was it the tutorial? I can't tell when I am too busy being the harbringer of destruction.)Do I intend to make this a real criticism? Not really. I can however point out if you are just wanting to look for a cheap thrill for smashing cars up, then I would somewhat suggest this title. Everything else is like it was in a low budget, which isn't in my tastes. If there is more areas to go for, then I may come back later.This is your captain, and you'll die on the previous flight.

												The first thing that you must keep in mind if you have purchased this game ( or got for free ) is that you didn't spend a whole lot of money for it. For this, you will be Thankful ; you do get what you pay for. Don't expect a Burnout Series game level of development and gameplay. If you want a ' quality ' game, be prepared to pay the premium and scroll past Crash Time 2.The game is based on a German TV show called ' Alarm für Cobra 11 – Die Autobahnpolizei Ausfahrt ', a TV show that I cannot figure out as to whether or not is a serious crime drama or a German spoof take on the 80's series, Miami Vice. If you are from an English speaking country, the TV show that it is based on looks really really bad ( I did some youtube research by watching a couple of episodes to try and better understand what this game is based on )Graphics :  I haven't seen a PC game since that late 90's that has such a short draw distance and pop in. You can actually see the grass grow as you drive by embankments. The developers must have heard ' Bloom ' and ' HDR  ' and thought ' you mean ' Glare ' as that is what you get. Glare then translates to making the screen bright white in some areas. The plus to this level of techincal wizardry is that you don't need an i7 and a pair of Titans to play this game. The specs required to play this game are from around 2003 i.e. if you are reading this review, your computer can run the game. Yes there are some slow downs, but in general, it's not a bad frame rate for a 2003 standard driving game. Unlicensed cars which are very obviously actual BMW, Mercedes, VW's, etc. The cars are not bad at all, hence why you can actually tell what they are based on ( or not badged as ). The city is well, German ( industrial, efficient and logically laid out but a little bland  ; mostly built in the last 70 years onwards due a disagreement with a couple of countries a number of years ago ).  Graphics wise, not the worst - not the best - kinda ' Eh ' if you can forgive the HDR ( or lack of ) and pop in that is.Gameplay : Hmmm. You have a car and can drive around - really enough said. The ' handling ' is an arcade racer, not a sim. Don't expect fantastic drifts, just understeer and poor brakes. I tend to use the handbrake instead of the normal brakes for stopping. The nearest driving experience would be if CrazyTaxi had a love child with an early TOCA game. The story is as deep as a standard cup of water but hey, you either paid $0.99 or got this game for free right?Voice acting : Voice acting needs a special mention all of it's own. You need to play the game to understand where I am coming from around this. I have NEVER heard such bad voice acting from ANY game, TV show, telemarketing scammer, etc. When I first heard the characters, it was quite amusing. As the game went on, it becomes, well a little bit creepy. Ever heard a 6 year old in a school play? Well it's a bit like that but spoken by a 40 plus year old guy.  Why really bad English accents? Why not German's speaking English? I think this would have worked better ( and they could have slipped in the word Squirrel for bonus points ) .... You have been warned. Controls :  I have read some reviews on this game that say that the controls are difficult. I did not experience this problem as I plugged in my generic USB gamepad AKA PS2 copy and configured to suit a PS2 layout. You MUST use the D Pad to control the menu up and down then use the top button to select ( Triangle for PS2 ) and circle equivalent ( PS2 ) to go back. If you use the keyboard at any point on the menu, the game pad will be disabled. It's really not very hard to figure out though. To configure, enter the control lay out menu and set the control for the button of your choice ( press enter on the keyboard, then the button on the game pad that you want to use for that control ). For those that have configured a DOS / Windows 95/98 game pad, it's back to those days. Once configured, controls were responsive and worked as you want them to.Conclusion :  Reading the above you are probably wondering why I am recommending this game? The fact remains that it is a very cheap ( or Free )  FULL game with graphics that exceed homebrew games. Buy it, but don't expect Burnout Paradise for $0.99c or Free. If you want Burnout Paradise, then don't be so cheap and buy it ( or wait for a Steam Sale 75% off ).Note that support for the game was ditched after about a year from release, but likely not for the reason that Apple use to ditch support to sell you another product ( though we are upto Crash time 5 according to the interweb )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was quite the experience, the detail put into the driving and car damage is something to brag about. Granted, you should expect the kind of detail from a game called Crash Time II. This game runs very well even on cheap computers and the graphics are pretty sick for the price you pay for it. The best part of Crash Time II is that it is a very challenging game, i had to try most of the missions four or five times before i was able to nail it. Theres not much to do but chase bad guys, do tricks, and wreck stuff, but this is still a pretty fun game. The GSA team rates Crash Time II two out of five but dont let the low rating fool you, you should get this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I cannot lie, I did kind of enjoyed this game. This may look nothing much, but it still does include a better car damage collisions than most of the racing games and of course, really nice made driving physics.As much as there are missions to do it is quite involving and interesting to play, and even after you still have a chance to explore most of the places until the interest will disappear, but when it does it vanishes in a seconds. I would say it is not a magic game, but is worth at least to try it out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guten TagWillkommen auf der Autobahn mit mir Warenzeichen. Heute werden wir auf Crash-Zeit II aussehen.Very good game over all to say the least. Well worth the $10. (Got mine for $2.50)The graphics in the game are great and the physics are great as well. The only two things I do have to complain about is the voice acting and the missions.First, take a look at all the reviews below this one and then come back to here. Well what did you see? I bet that every single review you saw complained about the voice acting and how terrible it is, that it is so funny. Am I right? Good. Another thing that I say is bad is the missions. Are they supposed to happen randomly? Are they timed? Do you have to drive to a certain area to activate them? The game tells you nothing about where to go to find missions. No waypoints, no markers, nothing.Well now that the bad is done, lets talk about the good.Amount of cars: good 10/10Features on cars ie. Police cars make noise and have working lights: good 10/10Smashing around and crashing at 230kph: excellent 12/10Missions, for what I have done so far for them: good 8/10EXPLOSIONS: good 10/10Graphics: good 7/10Sounds: good 8/10World Design: good 9/10Voice acting: NEIN 0/10Mission finding: NEIN 0/10If you can find it on sale or get a coupon (thats what I did) then buy it and just have fun crashing into trains and other cars.Tschüs			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recieved this for free from a site I found on reddit. While I of course like free games, I don't often also like playing them. As far as this title goes, I don't find anything special about this game, and in my opinion it is quite... uncomplete.The graphics are decent at least, not great, but not bad either, and while they paid less attention to environment, cars are as shiny as they can be, which would make sense in a car game.However the gameplay is where it takes a turn for the worse. The only storyline I've been able to gather is that you and a friend of yours are some sort of undercover cops who use a civilian car to catch. While there is no continuos gameplay, at least you have freeroam, and you can get random missions from the dispatch.But let's see what the actual missions are about... well, chasing criminals, smashing their car until they come to a full stop. I have so many pet peeves when it comes to realism in this game that I can barely make myself write this review. Firstly, there are absolutely NO human animations. If the scenario makes your partner jump into a truck while you keep steady near it.... he just stays in the car, even though supposedly he is driving a truck now, even though he is still riding shotgun with you. Turning the wheel? No animation. Crashing recklessly in everything? No animations. The evil guy whos car you just totaled with nothing left other than the wireframe? No animation. What's more, you don't even arrest him. You just wreck his car (which takes a ridiculous ammount of bumping into) and then.. leave. And I guess he will just sit patiently idling (not like he has animations to begin with) in his carwreck until your fellow police officers arrive.About the sound, not great either. The radio consists in a few metal instrumentals, which I can't say I dislike, but that's about it. No radio control, you always listen to the same tracks over. However that shouldn't be bugging you more than the total lack of talent in voiceacting. I'm not trying to bash the developer here. I didn't do my research, might as well be some guys in a basement, struggling to make their dream game but still... the voice acting is terrible. TERRIBLE.All this being said, if you get the game from free from some random humblebudle-esque deal on the internet, go ahead and at least waste some time with this, however I would never recommend anyone actually paying money for.

												Based on a long running german TV-series about two highway police officers, I cant say I ever watched the show but I'd say it is very loosely based on it.Now, we all know games about movies tend to be usually bad, so what about a game about a TV-show? If your first thought was it must be worse than you'd be right.In case you are a fan of police stories or racing then you should probably take a step away from this. If you just wanna crash into things and kill about 10 or 15 minutes while you wait for a better game to download then you might as well.The cars and the damage models are the only thing remotely fun. As the damage model isnt only affecting your car visually but also your performance, the things they expect you to do, either will be fun or just frustrating.Limiting the amount of damage your car can sustain or how much property damage you do are mission objectives that just utterly ruin it.You'd think that it makes sense seeing how they are police officers but no, thats not the case in a lot of them. For instance: A girl gets kidnapped but as soon as your car takes more than 15% of damage the mission fails. Too bad girl, have fun with your kidnapper.The awful mission design, horrendous voice acting and repetetive music is what will ultimately make this unenjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is quite litteraly a BLAST, this game is so funny, i dont know why this game gets so much hate becuase, yes there are a few bugs, yes the controls are stinky, but if you play it, you just love it. The physics are great, it is an open-world so you can derp around in a large area, LOTS of great vehicles that have destruction, might i add= EXPLOSIONS ARE A PLENTY! I reccommend it to all. Also, about the missions, they are a little boring, i would just stick with a replay of a laborghini jumping a bridge and then hitting a car whilst falling through the map. I love this game!!!! *it is cheap, do it! dont listen to those sad haters who only say: ""This game sucks!"" because this game is ballerz* I would also reccommend getting a savefile that unlocks all the vehicles and stuff. Play this game, thats all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Screw the story, the only reason that you'll buy this game is for the cars and the crashes.The game mechanics are suprisingly good, and the graphics are still very good, given its age.I say screw the story because this game is supposed to be based on some german tv show and sports some laughable voice acting and scripts, not to mention that it is incredibly predictable. But who cares- you're here for the cars and the crashes, right?Let me tell you- There are cars and there are crashes, lots of crashes.On sale at $1.99, I think it is a bargain.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought this game on sale: 2,49€The missions are not only difficult but somewhat lack fun and precise gameplay.Sometimes you dont actually know what to do in certain missions or find out too late and see the game over screen far too soon. I had like 2 seconds already in the first mission and if you fail a target you have to start the process all over again.The graphics are ok keeping in mind that the game is made in 2009. The open world is not very big but very alive. There are trains, helicopters ect adding a lot life to the game. There are also many different vehicles. Traffic AI could be improved by far. There are some bugs in game like when cars cross the andreas cross they jump or easily have an accident which should have been fixed with a patch long ago and shows lack of support from developers. German voices are horrible and a joke, dialogs neither useful nor funny except some of the sarcastic advertisment which is seen on buildings or truck cargo containers. The music depends on your taste and can be switched off. Cars have some features like the horn, turn on alarm, blink etc. This game is not intended to be a driving simulator and therefor the physics of the vehicles are acceptable. I however cannot recommend the game for an average price of like 10 € since main gameplay is awfull. Either try Crash Time 3 or buy another open world game like sleeping dogs, watch dogs or GTA 4 or 5 or Driver San Francisco which are a bit more expensive but add much more fun in gameplay, better graphics, better voiceacting, bigger worlds and better music. The game seems to be a mix of Bournout and Need for Speed but you rather get those titles for like 10 bugs.The game also has no steam achievements to offer. 2,49€ is not a waste of money if you wanna try it out. I am fine with the purchase but i am also happy i didnt pay more. I watched some youtube videos and saw enough screens to be prepared what i can expect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not a bad game, but could be better. Engine sounds are a bit whacky - for example, a lot of 6 cylinder engines sound like 5 cylinders, and the RPM range isn't accurate. The story could use some help. But I doubt this game is gonna get better anytime soon, anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crash Time is racing action open world game where you play as a cop and you are cheesing many different cars, trucks and stuff.Game in general is not that bad for me, cause I like to drive freely and destroy as much as I can, but after a while it started to be boring cause thare are not many things to do.So first good thing about this game is that you can play split screen co-op with your friends and the other good thing is car destruction. For me it looks pretty realistic, even though it is an old game.Bad things about this game are voice acting and boredom, cause as I already mentioned there is not many things to do you can only cheese cars and play races. And ofcourse price of this game, I mean 10 dollars for this is to much...Anyway my overall rating is 6/10 if it has been below 6 I would give a negative review			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i did not buy thisw game i got a free key from a Bundle Stars giveaway.if you use wheel i recomend 300-600 degress1080 deg will be too mutchif you want a police simulator this is not for you,but soem fun and challening stuff to do.the positive:some challenging missions, like Bank Heist- granades istead of coffy.-deadzone adjustment.-various type of cars-free roam-pros works with t500rs-fun missions-races agianst ai-destrctable objects-stop criminals-escape pursuits-gear box damage you cnascratch the cars,-you can kill the car engine.-you can go crazy drive where you want no invisible walls or reset,but you can,t drive in the water you will be reset.-------------------------Cons/negative:-ai is very bad, unrealistic cops.if they were real life cops they would be fired,cops dont help you in missions they just amke iut harder aand ram you and crash and spin out.-races agianst ais are way too easy for me (i play on hard on every mission)-traffic crash make and make a mess.-some missions are unrealistic with  cathing criminals by jumping on ramps.-no multiplayer-cars are chacking for no reason sometimes-only few cars have cockpit view,(buggy,military vehicle,go kart)but some cars have cockpit view btu its not good.the gokart and the military vehicle have it.suddenly game get black but not mirror,cant use fanatec clubsport shifter,or the csr elite pedals,but the game came out in 2008, and the hardware i use is never.bugs that make you wall under the trackissu that suddenly change the input devise to keyboard,steering wheel is cocking up toosome buildings and opbjects have low textures.CANT Skip al cut scenes. only some.fake stairs,with no stepsbugsthat ruins missions,like take out missions where you need to ram the criminal's cars and you hit them hard but oyu are ghosting, and dont hit him and mission is ruined.ai do not drive like a race driver would but like a beginner.this game looks like it was rushed.doing all the missiosn all over agian would be boring for some,and you unlock cars btu cant use them to anything besides driving aroundno car cutomisationtyhere are some mods for this game,btu nto many, but if you finish this game youdotn ahev anything to do anymore in this game.

												Suprisingly great racing game! Awesome graphics on par with full price racing games on the market. The driving feels great although its more arcade than simulation. Good variety of missions: Its not only about races. For example, you also need to chase ennemies GTA style, escape from others and control drones that will explode on your command. All this in a big sandbox city with great destructibility (on cars and many others objets).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I obtained it for free via a giveaway, and as soon as I launched it, it had tha bad-simulator-feeling. Which, in some way, is. The menu interface, the music, even the fonts used are screaming ""german simulator"". I believe that the developers thought to retouch an unfinished simulator and make it something more like a ""racing"" arcade game. What do we have as a result? A bad polished low budget Burnout style racer, full of simulator elements that are entirely useless (it has dedicated buttons for indicator lights for example). It has one of the worst AI I've seen for a while in a racer, there is no indication to what is the main campaign or the single missions, you just randomly pick a mission and hope you will proceed afterwards. And -oh my god- the voice acting is so fricking bad, it's hilarious.PROS:decent graphicsresponsive controlsCONS:everything elseVerdict:4/10This game is so bad, it's actually funny.. Until it's not anymore. Stay away from it, unless you can have it for free.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know, I am going to have to complain, what a surprise that is huh? Okay so what do we have here... The graphics are something I can deal with because we all know that graphics doesn't make a game, However it does improve the quality of a game quite well and my pc could run this at super omega ultra high quality, the graphics on high could still use some work however. With saying that, it could definitely be improved upon. My 2nd complaint has to come from the voice acting, ABSOLUTELY terrible. It literally sounds like you hired people just randomly off the street that had NO experience at all with any form of voice acting before this, I mean for all I know you could have picked up some bums off the street and told them you'd buy them a bottle of booze if they read words off a paper, because quite frankly that's what it sounds like to me. My 3rd complaint has to come from the spawn. I crashed on the road and I pressed R which is the respawn button in this game by the way, anyways... I was NO WHERE NEAR, the river and for some reason, your coding sucks so badly that giving me a spawn in the river was a good idea, but it wasn't only that! I pressed R again, ONLY TO BE SPAWNED IN THE RIVER AGAIN, you want to guess what I did next? I pressed R and what happened? Respawned in the water again and again and again making this game even more unplayable and unacceptable than it already is to begin with. It can't be that hard to make actual spawns that are decent that are not in the middle of the water scuba diving. Let's be honest here that's♥♥♥♥♥♥programming. Another problem I have seen in this game is some of the missions seem very... Mediocre and even that is being polite and being nice. I had more fun doing bugger all in this game than I did doing the actual 'story line' which barely exists in this game to say the least. Now this isn't the worst and I realize that but (Who expected it to be in the first place I mean let's be honest here.) That doesn't give you the excuse to release something so appallingly broken that it's rendered unplayable because the developers are either trolls or rookies when it comes to creating codes in a game that make it an enjoyable experience. At least this game doesn't seem to be running on Lemonade stand funds like some games so I'll give it that... (*Cough* most simulators that are on steam.) Also this game lacks mouse functions for whatever reason so you use your arrows for menus and we all know we're too lazy for that. Takes more time then using the mouse and that's boring. There's absolutely no reason why you couldn't add in a mouse mechanic, no reason whatsoever. With all these complaints I cannot give you a recommendation. There's no way, especially when there comes a time when you have to look out for your fellow steam users and help them before they bite the bullet and waste their precious time and money on a pathetic excuse of a game like this. Do I recommend this game to friends and other steam users? Not on your life, there's no chance in hell that I could do that. Do NOT buy this game you WILL be disappointed. The game seems like it goes nowhere just like this review, just filling up characters in a box telling you how unbelievably bad a game is.(Originally Released Aug 27, 2009 but seems like it's from the 1980's but with better graphics for a game back then. In other words it's♥♥♥♥♥♥)12/10 DO NOT BUY.Thank me later. Penguin out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game looks very good visually and there's lots of fun bits here and there (example, exploding cows). That aside, the tutorial does not help you figure out how to play the game in the slightest. It teaches you simple things like, ""How to tail a car,"" and such. But it doesn't really help otherwise. I kinda gave up on the tutorial after the second part since the car I was driving didn't have good handling and I ended up destroying the front wheels to the point that I couldn't drive it anymore. There's also no area where you can see the controls. If there is then I'll correct that part, but as far as I looked I couldn't find any control mapping. Overall, the game can be very fun. I just had a very difficult time figuring out the controls which turned me off instantly. Most games have been very intuitive about teaching players their controls (even back in the day when controls were simple and easily understood on systems like the SNES). This does not teach you how to use your controller/keyboard. Just kinda figure it out on your own and hope you don't press some ""self-destruct"" button (note, there is no self-destruct button as far as I know) accidentally.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game when it was on sale at just .99$ so i decided to pick it up just cause, assuming it wouldn't be great based on the major price reduction. To my delight I was wrong, the game is a blast to play. The graphics of the cars before and after they get smashed are great and so is the map. The map is fairly big, with lots of jumps and small race courses spread throughout the map. The game was originally made in Russian so the voice acting is a little rough, but does not take away from the overall game, and I honestly enjoy it, it's comically bad.There are only a few bad things in my own opinion when it comes to this game. When other cars explode, the explosions are weak, they don't look real at all. Also when you just want to explore the map it asks you if you want to do the missions to often making you stop for a bit to say refuse mission. Also when I started playing the game I didn't enjoynot being able to use the mouse, but it's easy to get used to.Positive-Large map-Many types of cars-Interacctable terrain (I.E. Trains, Cars, Cows etc...)-Realistic physics-Lots of fun missions-Wonderful graphics-Cars have great damage graphics-Lots of cars to smash-Tons of breakable items to drive through-Fun jumps scattered around the map-Replay after big smashesNegatives-Unrealistic explosions-Comically bad voice actingOverall a great game for the .99$ I got it for but honestly I believe it's worth the 10$ as well.9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

WTF?u cant escort a vehicle while staying within its a radius of 30m more than 7s? Guess what,after u fail to stay away from the vehicle that u are escorting,u have to listen to 1min and a half of dull conversations,which sounds like reading from a piece of paper.And when attackers attack,ur fellow cop cars just expolde when u see no rocket or bullet flying around.And only when ur partner radioed that suspects are armed that u knew what hit them! lol When the instruction shows:STOP OPPONENT! ok,i'm stupid enough to try to ram it into the fence and get the car stuck to STOP it,his car just disappear and RESET the way when u press R,then it respawn and lleave u with the stupid fence (no offense,fence)! okay,if thats not the issue,there are chances that when it or u stuck even on his own and he reset,its FREAKING 467m away,leaving me staring at the countdown of 7s after which I fail the misssion.Moreover,there is a time when i finished the former objective and found my next target to STOP/Ram 250m stuck behind me,crap,and i failed by not having him kept up.And i still keep playing till the 3rd mission,in the 2nd mission(A day off),they chose to race over who gets the day off cause they are not allowed to both get it.C'mon,aint u police or something? And u do that street race stuff? Raming ove fences and stuff? Jezz,I'm done.Uninstalled.Shame of the not bad graphics.Not amused.And,time for a nap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terrible game. The controls are never explained to you, nor appear to be configurable. The launch options are something I'd expect out of a 20th century game, and the voice acting and dialogue is terrible. On top of that, it is far too easy to be thrown out of the map by crashing, which appears to be a common thing. I gave up after I got stuck, tried to respawn, and kept respawning under the map.

The dialog is also corny, but being able to drive a big rig into on-coming traffic is always a joy. The car physics are decent and they deform somewhat realistically.

Didn't really know what was going on, and it seemed like a ruckus of trouble to play this.10/101/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game when it was on sale at just .99$ so i decided to pick it up just cause, assuming it wouldn't be great based on the major price reduction. To my delight I was wrong, the game is a blast to play. The graphics of the cars before and after they get smashed are great and so is the map. The map is fairly big, with lots of jumps and small race courses spread throughout the map. The game was originally made in Russian so the voice acting is a little rough, but does not take away from the overall game, and I honestly enjoy it, it's comically bad.There are only a few bad things in my own opinion when it comes to this game. When other cars explode, the explosions are weak, they don't look real at all. Also when you just want to explore the map it asks you if you want to do the missions to often making you stop for a bit to say refuse mission. Also when I started playing the game I didn't enjoynot being able to use the mouse, but it's easy to get used to.Positive-Large map-Many types of cars-Interacctable terrain (I.E. Trains, Cars, Cows etc...)-Realistic physics-Lots of fun missions-Wonderful graphics-Cars have great damage graphics-Lots of cars to smash-Tons of breakable items to drive through-Fun jumps scattered around the map-Replay after big smashesNegatives-Unrealistic explosions-Comically bad voice actingOverall a great game for the .99$ I got it for but honestly I believe it's worth the 10$ as well.9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Long time later it was included in some bundle,I totally forgot about it and tried it out now. The game is not horrible,but I also wouldn't call it good.The game is based on a german series about policemen called Alarm für Cobra 11 and was made clearly for the fans of it. The driving mechanics aren't bad,so it's playable,but after a while it gets boring like hell. Despite not being a total crap,I wouldn't recommend you to buy it,especially not for the full price.5/10 would not crash my time again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1 of the crap i've played..Its a good idea,but a bad design.It has a career mode in which the 1st case is to escort a container.i can live with a max distance limit,but a min 1? WTF?u cant escort a vehicle while staying within its a radius of 30m more than 7s? Guess what,after u fail to stay away from the vehicle that u are escorting,u have to listen to 1min and a half of dull conversations,which sounds like reading from a piece of paper.And when attackers attack,ur fellow cop cars just expolde when u see no rocket or bullet flying around.And only when ur partner radioed that suspects are armed that u knew what hit them! lol When the instruction shows:STOP OPPONENT! ok,i'm stupid enough to try to ram it into the fence and get the car stuck to STOP it,his car just disappear and RESET the way when u press R,then it respawn and lleave u with the stupid fence (no offense,fence)! okay,if thats not the issue,there are chances that when it or u stuck even on his own and he reset,its FREAKING 467m away,leaving me staring at the countdown of 7s after which I fail the misssion.Moreover,there is a time when i finished the former objective and found my next target to STOP/Ram 250m stuck behind me,crap,and i failed by not having him kept up.And i still keep playing till the 3rd mission,in the 2nd mission(A day off),they chose to race over who gets the day off cause they are not allowed to both get it.C'mon,aint u police or something? And u do that street race stuff? Raming ove fences and stuff? Jezz,I'm done.Uninstalled.Shame of the not bad graphics.Not amused.And,time for a nap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where can i start with this game?Well first off i got it for free so atleast im not annoyed that I payed the steep price of £6.99.Secondly, Imagine everything you know and love about driving games like stuntman (which IMO this is a poor copy of), now forget it all. The game handles very poorly, from not being able to ue the analog stick in menus to the the car being sluggish to turn one second, to spinning 360 the next.Continuing with controles, they are so random its not even amusing, (Y) is horn, (X) is siren (on, on silent, off), the right analog stick only has left and right in use and thats only for the respective indicators (im not even joking) and as far as i can tell, the bumpers do nothing at all (atleast in the tutorial anyway).Interface wise the game is also quite poor, your speedo, map, mission objective and distance to target are all in seperate parts of the screen so you find yourself looking around at everything but the road. The speedo also has this odd feature of telling you what speed you need to hit ramps at, it will do this by taking up 1/4 of your screen and having a huge green mark and arrow at the speed you need to be, this speed is NOT optional, too slow you fall into a gap/dont make the jump, too fast and the game will send you flying into anything that it feels could be in your way.There is also a replay cam that will replay what you did not 2 seconds ago (that seems about the extent og its record time) whenever it feels you've done something special, this is considered anything from a high speed overtake to a 45 degree turn, a 1080 aileron roll over a building or a 360 backflip over a roundabout? nah thats not replay worth (oh and your leads can get away while the replay is heppening).Gameplay. The random spawn for cars is so borked that I swear i saw a family car with a caravon on it pull out of an industrial complex, and this wasnt a one off mistake, about 30 cars where queing to get out of a police testing area. The waypoints are another thing that are non-optional, miss one by a smidge and you will find yourself doing a 180 or slamming it into reverse while your lead gets away. Lastly that brings me to the persuit mechanics, it told me to attempt to stop the van with some light taps, instead I got infron of it and forced it to stop. Not good enough. Ok its traiing i can forgive that, so 5 taps it is, then I have to dissable the vehicle, so I flip it on its side with some fancy driving, nope, didnt fill the damage indicator so it de and respawns to carry on.Overall this game was very poor, it looked ok back in 2010 when it was made im sure, but now its dated, jaded and needs to fade into the background.~Round Up~Story - unrated, I refused to play after the tutorial.Graphics - 7 - There not the worst and I'm sure when it was released they did look good.sound - 5 - forgetable OST with less than average voice acting topped with a siren that is all you can hear when its on. The only reason I didn't rate lower is becasue the crash sounds arn't that bad.Gameplay - 3 - Poor controles with a bad HUD and strange mechanics.Overall - 4 - It might have a good story and if your into games like stuntman you could get on with it but it just seems like a copy done wrong, if you like stuntman, break out the PS2 and play it, you'll have alot more fun, trust me. £6.99? I'd  still be anoyed if I'd paid £2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												   This game reminds me in some way hybrid of Midtown Madness and Burnout Paradise City. Good game about cars with elements of open world made by the small, unknown studio. Crash Time 2 has good optimization, interesting physics and damage system; missions bring some variety to gameplay. In game you will not meet any pedestrians, but instead you can squish cows, all of them.   So, if you like such sort of games - buy it, if discount will be [/b] 60% [/b] or higher.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DO NOT PAY FOR THIS GAME!!! I was lucky enough to pick up this hunk of junk on a free give away, and I am so glad I didn't actually pay for it. Firstly, any type of car game that you have to attempt to maintain speed on a keyboard is going to suck from the beginning...Then you have friendly AI that will swerve randomly even if you are beside them sending you veering into the side rails...If that's not enough, it seems your car is made of paper in comparison to enemy vehicles, ie. sharing a side by side front on collision with a train at the same speed only to watch the enemy in my 'totalled' screen drive off visibly unharmed...I'm sure there's plenty more wrong, and possibly some good things, but the first mission was enough for me to move to my next game...

												I just gave this game a try since it pretends to be an ""open-world driving game"", and that got me curious.This game is...this game...the mechanics of the driving and all are actually pretty enjoyable, and the graphics are pretty decent too. The level design however is awful and the voice actors are disgusting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You can't really complain about the game for the price it is, or at least was, when I bought it.It's a pretty crappy game overall but has some good features, such as the driving, generally I don't like car games but this has got to be one of the best car games I've played where the car responds straight away, without the annoying delay and inverted controls.Anyways, the actual missions suck balls and so does the rest of the game.Buy it with leftover steam credit or don't buy it at all.

												Ok, I'm just going to state things what I like about this game and what I don't like about it.Graphically, it looks nice. But don't judge a book by its cover because the story in this game is meh. There are no real story in this game. It's just like a Cop 'Simulator'. You just freeroam and sometimes you get random missions and sometimes you need to go to the actual mission. If this game were going to be a single player type of game it better has a good story. Come on, seriously. The only thing good here is just gameplay and that's just it. You just drive around as a cop and about 10 minutes later you will get bored. The price that I'm willing to pay for this game is $3.My rating : 4/10                   I find it easy to get boredIf I were going to buy single player games I would like it to have a nice story, gameplay and game mechanics.But if I were going to buy multiplayer games I would like it to have a nice community, gameplay, game mechanics and a story(if possible).But sometimes, I just like a game where you just get in a match and just start killing.Here are the Pros and Cons.Pros:Decent GameplayGood GraphicsController SupportOpen WorldSplitscreen SupportCons:A little bit of storyBad voice actingMeh game mechanicsNo cutscenesSmall worldNo online multiplayer ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game I would recommend to people who like cars in general. Its gameplay is not realistic but not as unrealistic and ridiculous as you'd expect. You play a cop in the autobahn which is quite fun and creative in my opinion. It certainly does not stack up to something like a Need For Speed game but it's not really meant to compete with games like that.Overall- 6.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok.... Let me be frank. This game is really bad. REALLY, bad. The voice acting is, bad. Very, bad. I know I said bad a lot, but bad is all I can get out of this game. Its like a nightmare you never want to be in. The game is so boring I cant use good words like ""terrible"" or ""awful"", because they just dont fit this game. This game is so bad, it doesn't need those fine words. It just needs the basic word ""bad"". So dont spend all your well earned cash on this game like I did. Dont be me, because this game is bad. So, overall...     ...7/10. Thanks for reading.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was painfull for the first 6 minutes. It feels like a sega saturn era game. The grafics are better than sega saturn though. It is poorly made. Well worth the 1$ sale price tag.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably one of the worst driving mechanics i have seen since watchdogs, i can see why bundlestars gave this away for free. 1/10 the 1 is for the damage system to vehicles that was kinda nice other than that this game looks as though it was developed in about 2 months. save the money dont buy this game.

Posted: October 8, 2015
												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #34 - Crash Time IISo the Oxford dictionary added janky to their list of words this year.janky (adj.): of extremely poor or unreliable quality.And it just so happens that janky sums up Crash Time 2 very nicely.I start, like with many games, by trying out the Tutorial.  So I'm start with a mission where I have to pursuit and stop a car.  Okay, sound simple enough.  In fact, I very quickly pin the car against a fence, and render it completely immobile.  Oh wait, apparently the game didn't expect me to do that so soon, so instead of giving me credit for stopping the car, it disappears and then respawns.  Now I have to chase it down again.Eventually I chase it down and this time I look long enough that the game rewarded me for it.  In the next part of the tutorial,  I have to chase the car again, except this time I have to ram it to do enough damage to stop it.  So I start ramming the car, and eventually I make the car flip over.  Awesome, I win, right?  Oh wait, no, instead of getting credit for stopping the car, the game just makes the car respawn.  Apparently it wants me to keep ramming the car.  Apparently this game equates thinking outside the box with cheating.So after ramming my way to victory, next I'm on a mission where it tells me to hit the ""Action Button"" to launch a remote control drone.  It doesn't tell me which button on the controller that is, it just says ""Action Button"" like it's obvious.  I proceeded to mash every single button my controller and none of them worked.  Oh wait, I forgot to push down on my thumbsticks.  There we go, the action button was apparently mapped to pushing down on the right thumbstick.  Totally my first choice for an ""action button"", and not those pesky X or A buttons.  So now that I've figured out how to hit the action button, it spawns what looks like a stick of dynamite on wheels.  Now I'm controlling a remote control drone.  I then drive it to my target and hit the ""Action Button"" again and blow it up.  Now I'm back in my car and it wants me to launch another drone.  Okay, so now as I am driving this other drone I have to hit this jump just right, and it will launch me over a fence to my target.  Well I wasn't going fast enough so I end up vertical against the fence.  Now I can't get myself off the fence.  I hit a bunch of different buttons, trying to get back into my car instead of the drone.  I hit the back button and sure enough I'm back in my car.  Except I didn't go back to my car, the game teleported the car to me.  So now I'm in my car stuck vertically on the fence.  I do eventually get through tutorial and decide to try and actual game.  So I pick the option to Patrol and get a mission where I have to go to the harbor to escort a car that's being delivered.  So I start by driving towards the harbor as directed.  But then as I get part way towards the harbor, suddenly my screen is black, well most of my screen anyway.  The UI is there, including my speedometer and minimap, but there's no longer a road.  Apparently I'm supposed to drive to the harbor blindfolded.


Driving to the harbor blindfolded 
A Screenshot of Crash Time II
By: EvilSpaniard




I restart the mission and this time it lets me make it to the harbor without blindfolding me.  So now I'm escorting this truck.  The truck has the prototype car in it, and in turn 2 cop cars are escorting the truck.  So I have to follow the truck from behind, but not too close, and not too far either.  I guess I'm like the undercover backup that no one is supposed to know about.  So I follow the truck for a little ways and 2 vans drive up and start taking out the cop cars.  I better help those poor cops, so I floor it to catch up.  Oh wait, that would be common sense.  I forget this game doesn't reward me for common sense because I'm breaking the rules, because now I'm too close to the truck.  Nevermind the mortal danger here, I'm outpacing the games scripting, and we can't have that.I can just picture this conversation where the publisher warns the developers of this game, ""Hey guys, the game is coming along, but it could really use some polish"".  Except the developers misunderstood and made all of the cars in the game shiny.   Unfortunately, no amount of shine could possibly cover over this janky turd of a game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not worth your time. Doesn't live up to the name. It is not about crashing or damaging cars, it's about conducting boring routine tasks as a german police officer. First and foremost, the car models are quite well done, with excellent graphics for the time it came out. Apparently that is where the studio spent all their time and money. The game honestly feels like a graphical showpiece for car modeling. Besides the cars, the environments look blocky and bad. The gameplay also suffers. The worst offender is the car driving, as I can't remember driving mechanics so poor. Your small boring generic sedan, which is basically the only car you drive during the game, handles like a boat. Turns are taken terribly, and breaking seems to take forever to slow down. There is no handbreak or way to take quick turns, which means turning basically means slowing down to a complete stop then slowly turning. Backing up doesn't work either. Once you've stopped you press break and it changes you to reverse, then you need to let off the button and press it again to start backing up. There is no way to look at controls in game. I had no idea what anything did. I tried looking for a handbrake, and there seemed to be 2 different ones, but once didn't turn you faster, it only flung your forward at an angle for some reason when you were slowing down. There is no way to look behind you, which you actually need to do in the game, so I have no idea why they wouldn't include it. You have to use this tiny unhelpful rearview mirror. Then there is the gameplay. The single player makes no sense and isn't untuitive. There is a case, single race, and patrol at multiple different locations - tabs. Apparently you just select a patrol with a flag and then drive around and wait to get a call, which makes no sense for a single player. The voice acting may be the worst and cheesiest I've ever heard. Missions have multiple parts, but if you fail 2/3 in you have to start from the beginning for no reason. This is easy because if you get spun around or accidentally hit the wrong turn, as is common with the terrible direction indicator on your small map, or you get stuck behind the tiny railing that you can't get through (logic?) and you are following someone, you will fall behind the certain distance. Then there are the parts you have to break a car to win. You are a cop but you have no gadgets or guns to help you, all you can do is crash into cars........sounds like the plan of no cop ever. Destroying vehicles takes forever because damage modeling makes no sense, and you only do tiny damage at a time. I flipped a car over 3 times within 30 seconds and he would just drive off with no damage to the top or side of his car. It never makes sense how the cars get damaged. So you have to destroy a car but it literally takes 7 minutes of you following it around hitting it, having no idea how far you are in destroying it, because it never changes in performance. Then there are missions that have you drive to certain spots to check things out, but instead of 3-4 spots, the game has you go to FOURTEEN spots, which should take about 12-15 min, for no reason but to inflate length and give you busy work. That isn't fun because the random german city is boring and generic looking, with nothing interesting to look at. There is really nothing to make this game worth playing. Good vehicle graphics though, even if they are super un-interesting to use or look at. 4/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is easy because if you get spun around or accidentally hit the wrong turn, as is common with the terrible direction indicator on your small map, or you get stuck behind the tiny railing that you can't get through (logic?) and you are following someone, you will fall behind the certain distance. Then there are the parts you have to break a car to win. You are a cop but you have no gadgets or guns to help you, all you can do is crash into cars........sounds like the plan of no cop ever. Destroying vehicles takes forever because damage modeling makes no sense, and you only do tiny damage at a time. I flipped a car over 3 times within 30 seconds and he would just drive off with no damage to the top or side of his car. It never makes sense how the cars get damaged. So you have to destroy a car but it literally takes 7 minutes of you following it around hitting it, having no idea how far you are in destroying it, because it never changes in performance. Then there are missions that have you drive to certain spots to check things out, but instead of 3-4 spots, the game has you go to FOURTEEN spots, which should take about 12-15 min, for no reason but to inflate length and give you busy work. That isn't fun because the random german city is boring and generic looking, with nothing interesting to look at. There is really nothing to make this game worth playing. Good vehicle graphics though, even if they are super un-interesting to use or look at. 4/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks to console losers we get ports all the time much like this garbage.No mouse, only keyboard control driving. I can deal with that though.The missions just suck, when you out-drive the stupid narrator you have to drive all the way back and re-do the jump so the ""checkpoint"" catches you.What a f*cking stupid game.1/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was bad. I got this game thinking the physics would be somewhat descent compared to the trailer and evidently I was wrong. The physics I'd say are pretty mediocre and not appeasing to my taste. The game was utterly boring. The controls were descent but the gameplay and the mission were terrible. It wasn't challenging at all and was rather tedious. The campaign/story mode for this didn't pull me in but the graphics were half descent. The replay value would not entice me to continue playing this game. I would not recommend this game. 3/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice graphics (I think the game is using Unreal Engine, no?), glitchy (I can go through the gutter? O.O), nice map and cars but the mission sucks and some sounds is reused from other games (The Horn came from GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas and when you crash onto another car, the sound is from Half Life 2).I'll give it a 7.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though the voice acting is bad and for some unknown reason other vehicles keep bouncing about like they have the bass up to max or have hydrolics, it's a fun game to kill time and just wreck cars and crash into things. That's all it is, wreck and crash.More for casual play.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												This feels like it could have been a much better game if the voice actors and mission designers had just been given a few high grade stimulants. The game is frankly, dull and flat like an cop drama that gets cancelled 2 episodes in.  You can play it for a while, but it really can't make you care enough to finish it. It's similar to the kind of show that you'd only watch if it were 3am and the only alternative was to be in a quiet room alone with nothing but the memory of regrets you've accumulated in a life mispent. While the physics and crashing are mildly interesting, the cars get damaged really badly really quickly, and leave you having to finish a mission on 3 wheels. While some people might relish this kind of challenge, I didn't. And there is a lot of ""put your car right here for 2 minutes at speed"" challenges which seem needlessly picky about car position. It's cheap, and will kill time as long as you care to play it, but it's just not engaging. Save up and play something more interesting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I see why this game was given away for free. God awful graphics and highly sub-standard gameplay. If you love blurry textures you will love this game. It controls just like the massively overrated game Crazy Taxi, which means no real braking system and you constantly careen into things. You get two brake buttons and neither of them slow you down enough to take a corner at even medium speed without just not being able to turn enough and slamming into a wall. I could not drift around a corner because I don't think it exists in this game. Even when I slowed down some, I still could not brake enough to get around the corner without going off the road. Just a really generic Sega Arcade game ripoff that sucks big time, mainly because you could take about ten seconds to find a far superior racing game anywhere. I played through the tutorial and that was enough for me to go right back to two other far superior games, Insane 2 and one of the best racing games ever, GRID 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
