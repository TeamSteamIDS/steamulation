												Second and in my opinion better expansion of Quake. You have few weapon alterations, different from first expansion, which are even more deadly.(I am big fan of multiple rockets and cluster grenades.) The game brings more items and enemies as well. You fight more fantasy foes than before, like altered knights and death knights which were turned into statues of greek warriors and minotaurs, floating swords or dark wizards who reminds me of Mental from Serious Sam. New items are Anti-Grav Belt and Power Shield. First one will make you jump higher into longer distances and second will reduce taken damage. Two new episodes contains fantasy and ancient history based levels with unique bosses like Guardians, Hephaestus or Overlord. Individual levels are pretty hard to play. Not because of lots of enemies, but because of shaking grounds, slippery surfaces (which leads to lava or void or another kind of death) and mazy levels.(Curse of Osiris!) But its really worth it. And after all these hellish fighting you spawn into final cave to face the Dragon. I recommend it highly for all FPS fans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dissolution of Eternity is the second and final Quake 1 mission pack. It's a very fitting end to the game's official content and dovetails nicely with the previous expansion pack, Scourge of Armagon. It was developed by Rogue entertainment who also developed Strife and American McGee's Alice.Dissolution is much more fantasy based than Armagon. There's a distinctly mythological slant to the whole thing. You fight fantasy enemies like statues that come alive, these wraith like grim reaper creatures, magical swords that float and attack you, and the final boss is even a Dragon. It reminds me a lot of the original Quake's roots as a medieval fantasy game before the developers redesigned it as a first person shooter.Indeed looking at Dissolution like that it really does make the game feel like it comes full circle with the original Quake. It has a few really good boss encounters that fill in the gaps of quality that were unfortunately lacking in the original. It is also legitimately challenging and several of the levels are very long and feel almost epic length.The main negatives I would say about Dissolution of Eternity are the additional weapons they added weren't as impressive as Scourge of Armagon. You have things like a nailgun that shoots slightly more powerful nails, a rocket launcher that shoots three rockets at once, a lightning gun that just shoots a single projectile. If you play it back to back with Scourge you'll start to miss MJOLNIR.But besides that. The levels are all good, the action is still fresh, and it has a final boss encounter that more than makes up for how easy Armagon was. It makes for a fitting end to the original Quake, and it only makes you want to play through the entire saga again to experience it a second time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just (2016-05-03) played the ""tomb of the overlord"" mission and had no problems with the elevatorbuttons. So either they fixed it or I just got lucky. Either way, another great expansion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The second mission pack for Quake gave us more of that great single-player action. There are also some new enemies and bosses in this one. You should definitely check this pack out along with the first one as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the mission pack. Quake is amazing, however, as many have already experienced, Mission Pack 2 is impossible to finish without cheating or using strange tricks. In Tomb of the Overlord, it is impossible to go up the elevator with the red arrow buttons. You can press them, but it doesn't move the elevator. You either have to rocket jump up or use the Fly cheat. I want to beat the normal way. Please fix.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Quake Mission Pack 2: Dissolution Of Eternity		* 8/10This second mission pack goes in an opposite direction compared to the first one.The game will be very tough as you will have to sweat longer to get new weapons, and the maps will be full of enemies, making this a real challenge.There are no new weapons but there are alternative ammos that give the player another fire option with different damage or effects, such as lava nails or multiple rockets.Level art now is more focused with meso-american, Egyptian or greek art styles prooviding more visual innovation, and according to that there will also be various minor bosses, such as guardians, or mummies.Considering the age of the game and the lack of 16:9 resolutions I would suggest to play it with any modern port available as it could provide some serious graphical update as well. I've played this with darkplaces and various texture packs.+++PROs+++ INNOVATION. This expansion provides a good product enriched with visual innovation and artistically inspired maps, not to mention the simplicity of the effective alternative ammos for the classic weapons. TOUGH. This expansion will really test you as you'll have to sweat a lot before you get something more powerful than your standard shotgun, you'll have to take down a lot of creatures with that first and going on with the game it'll be worse as there will be crowds of enemies, and you will have to wait for further weapons, making each level a tough challenge---CONs--- OLD ENGINE. The engine is quite old nowadays and lacks 16:9 resolutions. If you want higher resolutions you have to check also the DPI box in the Exe properties. Alternatively you can load the game using one of the many modern ports available around. I've used Darkplaces.I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840MIntel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This pack adds a lot more enemies and weapons, and the level design is pretty smart - the levels are much larger and average more than 100 enemies. The new weapons are very powerful - like the quad-rocket launcher - and seem a bit OP at times but it's still fun to use them on hordes of Quake's minions. The final level was pretty difficult for me, a Quake veteran. I recommend it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By far the inferior mission pack of the 2 here, the weapons are better but thats the only plus. Theres not very many levels, but the levels are absolutely HUGE. Theyre also poorly made with narrow hallways, confusing & bland areas make it easy to get lost, and in the earthquake levels and mazes (yes, mazes) make it bad. Only play if you're truly bored.  The final boss is much harder than the one in mission pack 1, thats about it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In Mission 7, Tomb of the overlord, there is an elevator button that doesn't work. The only way I was able to clear that level was to rocket jump to the upper floors, which depleted a lot of health, so I would appreciate a patch to fix this problem.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
