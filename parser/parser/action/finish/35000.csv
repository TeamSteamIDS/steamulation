												The game is not the newest so why add my bit on this still?Well because the reviews i have seen here miss to tell you one very important thing.What you really need to know about this game is how CALM it is.You could say how ZEN it is.From the pleasent painterly like graphics to the music and sounds (even those that occur duing fights) NONE of it has the overladen, agressive stings of the usuall Tripple A Action games.This game is a smooth calm spring rain on your nerves.The music calms you down and searching for the hidden items in the beautyfully ""drawn"" levels with the soothing colours and fishing your food from a river, bobbing on it's surface in your hat/boat is the best thing you could do after a  stressfull day of work.Would i recommend it?Absolutely! Makes me calm down every time i play it. ",272,75,3,37,14,1,18

												It’s a game aimed at kids, there’s no doubt about that. You can see that from the very presentation, to the fact that you don’t actually kill anyone despite battling countless “ninjas” on the way. As such it doesn’t offer much of a challenge, but it’s not easier than, say, Assassin’s Creed. That said it’s a game which is incredibly fun to play. It cute, it’s funny and the combat system is tight and satisfying. It has several playable characters which are kind of like different classes from RPGs, a crafting system and encourages exploration with a clever implementation of search for “spell scrolls”. Definitely an overlooked game, and it’s a damn shame I would’ve liked a sequel. Ah well…  ",401,125,17,32,42,8,47

												Ridiculously cute and funny, this is a game that is screaming for proper achievements. The characters are fun to play with. The level designs are sometimes a little heavy on the wide open spaces which can be a pain if you're hunting for, say, an elusive plant. The bosses are... very silly. If you fell for the trailers you will probably get a lot of fun out of being a ninja... or a chicken.... or a frog...			",202,163,1,25,7,1,20

												Mini Ninjas is quite a good game. I love the characters, enemies and combat system, (usually) and the game's voice actors do a pretty good job as well. It has quite an ""open world"" feel, whereas, it's not an open world, but you don't feel limited to a single path. The story is simple, you're a ninja and the evil samurai warlord is threatening to take over the world. You go out on a quest to defeat this warlord and save the ninjas who failed to do so before you. The game looks very nice in my opinion, and the music, while not anything amazing, does compliment it nicely. Combat system works good, you get a couple ninjas you can switch between, To be honest I only used like 3-4 of them, and that's because sometimes you must use a specific character. The bosses are basically: Run from boss until you're able to do a quicktime event. They're all quicktime events, so don't expect a whole lot of difficulty with them.But for me, I found this game to have some broken aspects/parts. On the ""avalanche escape"" sequence, It's incredibly hard to see, which is understandable, but I kept falling through cracks, or holes, and instead of dying, I'd be rolling/sliding until the avalanche eventually caught up with me. This was a VERY monotonous part of the game, and it really put a downer on the overall game. When you are in your hat on the water, it's quite soothing. but when you have to use your hat/boat to go through small waterways, it's incredibly slow and can be irritating.  This game is indeed a kids game, don't expect a big story, deep characters or a long playthrough, but I have to admit, the cutscenes between the Warlord and his captains are hilarious.This is a very good game for 10 euros, and I got it in a sale for 4, so I really recommend this game for players looking to burn off a couple hours without much challenge. I give it a fair 7/10, it's a cute game and it's worth the money.			",70,10,0,12,8,2,6

												Such a cute game. Although it's definitely more of a children's title, it's still a nice relaxing game for adults to enjoy as well.

Posted: December 14, 2014
												Steam is home to a lot of crap, and I do mean a lot.. But it also is home to a number of hidden gems that no one really talks about much.Mini Ninjas is one of those gems. A bit of an imperfect one, sure, but a gem nontheless. And like many hidden gems, it doesn't get a whole lot of attention. The game is kinda an action adventure game, with small elements of RPG and stealth. You play the role of a ninja named Hiro, who is tasked with finding all his lost friends and saving the world while he is at it. A lot of pressure, I know, but then you are a ninja with the power to control the elements, so it shouldn't be too hard (Which kinda is a problem for the game, I'll explain later)Being that you play the role of a ninja, stealth is a tool you'll be making a lot of use out of. As some might indicate, however, the stealth aspect of the game isn't really all that advanced, and oftentimes isn't used to avoid fights so much as it is to get the first strike in any given fight (or outright kill everyone in a patrol before they even have time to react). While it is possible to avoid fights, you won't want to in the early game, because you need to fight to gain XP and level up. Otherwise, the road ahead will be awfully harsh to those who don't kick enough butt. While quietly avoiding fights isn't encouraged (At least in the early game), the stealth system does indeed work very well, and in the late game, where  by then you are already maxed out, it becomes much more viable.When the time comes to fight, however, it is a mixed bag. Combat is simple, with a few basic attacks, a block breaker, and even a super move that can cause all sorts of pain for those unlucky to be the target of it. You also have a selection of items that can make fights go more smoothly, such as pepper bombs and potions that make arrows bounce off your face. However, the problem is that it IS simple, even to the point of simply mashing the two buttons until everyone is dead before moving on to the next fight. I myself don't mind it, but those seeking a deeper combat system might not enjoy the game as much.Sure, as you progress through the game you'll unlock more ninjas to fight with, each having their own style (Such as the fat ninja's brute force hammer skills that can make fighting larger enemies blindingly easy, or the archer ninja's ranged combat skills). However, I never really did bother to use any of them besides the ninja you start with. In DK 64, the devs made it so that you had to use all the Kongs in order to beat the game, so you couldn't just march through the whole game with Donkey Kong the whole time. Not so much here, where you can get through the entire game without changing ninjas ONCE. Maybe on hard mode, you would have to swap out ninjas more often, but on normal mode it is rather pointless for the most part, and in some cases even more fun, since fighting larger enemies feels more satisfying when you have to put up a real fight to take them down, rather than swapping over to fat ninja and just wailing on them, stun locking them to death. And even moreso, the starter ninja is the only one who can use magic, and as you progress through the game, you'll learn how important magic is.So, the combat is ok at best, the whole 6 ninja team gimmic is iffy when you can go through the whole game with the main star of the game just fine (and possibly makes the adventure so much more interesting and challenging), and stealth early on, while it does play a considerable role in the game, is mostly used for ambushing more than avoiding conflict altogether. And yet... I love this game.Maybe it is because it reminds me of the glory days, back when we had games like Banjo & Kazooie 1 & 2, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Jak and Daxter... You know those kind of games? The ones where you feel like you are on a real adventure throughout an interesting, if sometimes even strange, world waiting to be explored. You start out in your humble village, venturing out chapter after chapter on your way to the big bad guy himself, taking out his generals and anyone else who dares to get in your way, while at the same time taking a moment to explore the area for goodies and new spells to unlock. It helps that the world and the music that fills it is quite appealing, making the journey all the more enjoyable. That, and it is around 9-10 hours on my first playthrough, so you get your money's worth for sure. Gotta love a game that keeps you busy for a nice long while.As much as I'd like to yammer on and on, I'd like to wrap it up as a game that, while the gem is a bit cloudy, it is a gem nontheless, and a shame that it isn't more popular, let alone given a respected sequel (instead getting spinoffs on the Kinect and a Ipad runner.. Yeah, kinda a sad fate for the ninjas if you ask me).			",101,10,3,2,12,2,15

												Developers of family games often do hackwork and resort to oversimplification. IO Interactive didn’t succumb to temptation and made a game that stands head and shoulders above its rivals.Even though Mini Ninjas might not be as in-depth or content heavy as its modern peers, it's still a beautiful, fun game that opens up ninja culture to kids.Whether you're big or small, there's a lot to like about these little ninjas and their lengthy journey.Mini Ninjas is a good action game, entertaining, enjoyable and able to offer some hours of good fun, but far from being one of the great games of the genre.

												I do reccommend this funnily enough. Played it as part of a 'probably bad games what Humble did give me' thing a friend of mine and I did. Funnily enough, it was a pretty good 3d platformer. Possessing rabbits to sneak around is far more rewarding that it should be. As is floating down a river in your hat, or hiding in bushes to assassinate people, or... actually no. The stupid quick time event bossfights are not rewarding. But oh well. I do actually intend to finish it some day, so yeah. Not sure I would have bought it but now having played it I'd give it a few quid. Maybe.			",139,16,4,31,18,3,29

												Cute is what defines this title most. The graphics are cartoony and simple, the heroes are very cute and so are most enemies. There is no gore in this game, no dark twists, controls are simple and there is no character management. This makes this game very suitable for kids but also less appealing for someone seeking more depth. There is a lot of running around which I found a bit frustrating since the characters move slow. Fighting is mostly fun and diversified by the different ninjas but at times the camera and control can be a bit messy. I played with xbox360 controller and it worked great, no other technical issues noted.A nice light action adventure.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mini Ninjas is an extremely unnoticed game, and I believe it won't let you down. The setting is simple: A samurai warlord created an army by turning adorable animals into little warriors with his evil magic. The protagonists' mission is to defeat him and restore the balance of nature. Each character has his/ her unique abilities and special moves. Plus there are a lot of Kuji spells, potions and weapons so you can develop your own tactics to fight off the enemies. Besides, there are various scenes which are stunning and refreshing. You can fish, look for herbs and new Kuji spells while exploring. The boss fights are incredibly fun as they have different weaknesses and you have to find out the specific tricks yourself to defeat them. The soundtracks composed by Japanese traditional instruments work flawlessly and suit the gameplay very well. The rhythmic Taiko Drumming adds so much tension. However, the length of this game might be too short for those who have no interest in exploring and collecting stuff. The game might not work well in newer systems (because this is a rather old game)To conclude, Mini Ninjas provided me an unforgettable gaming experience. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes relaxing gameplay and imaginative stories.9/10			",312,79,17,34,24,4,32

												I was looking for an easy fun game. This was it. Its a simplistic adventure game that has easy controls and cute characters. There are items throughout the game you can collect to get a perfect score at the end of each mini mission. The enemies are silly and have their own quirks too. Most would consider this a childs game, but I find it enjoyable as well. Exploring the surrounding areas to find all the items and having fun with animals is interesting as well. For a simplistic game, a lot of thought was put into the little things. If you are looking for a rush rush game then you wont like this style, but it is a nice change of pace to all of the more intense games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The graphics in the game create a sort of cozy feeling even though all enemies look about the same and it seems like they took a few shortcuts during development by reusing character models more than usual the game still did not feel too repetative as is the case in many similar games.

												This game was so fun to play. After a little while, it gets slightly repetitive, but not really. Getting new characters, spells, progressing, the bosses, the entire game was fun. After beating the game, I just got a satisfied feeling.			",50,24,4,2,3,0,3

I remember buying this game a week after release from Best Buy on the Wii when i was 7. God damn the memories. I used to think this game was hard, but ive played the first mission and it's a lot easier than that♥♥♥♥♥♥remote.This game has got:1. Amazing environment2. A sick♥♥♥♥♥cutscene for every character as you unlock them (extras menu)3. Hardly violent (so good for kids)4. I feel like a real♥♥♥♥♥ninja playing this game. I dont know why. I just do.5. Who doesn't love ninjas? Am i right?The only thing I would say is bad about this game (well not bad but stupid)They have the stupidest way to defeat every boss.But other than that this game is worth the buy.

												Don't be put off by the cuteness. This game is not difficult, but neither is it just for kids. The art style and music are lovely, and there's lots to do--plenty of collectilbes, upgrades, alternate characters to unlock and dastardly bosses to defeat. Definitely worth a look if it's on sale.

												A strange little game. It is cartoony and fun, but has a really great and very satisfying, if not a bit simple, combat system. It is childish and simplistic, but has a great story and fun jokes both for adult and young. It is very linear, but also rather open. With many sidepassages and a lot of things to do. From alchemy, to collectibles, to just floating around in your hat and fishing.It has great music. Great voice acting. Great visuals. And it is fun to play. Definitely a must try.

												If you have kids and you want to play video games with them. Or you host a holyday party and you have ""little guests"" to entertain. Or you like to have a nice, cute, funny and relaxing day, This game is just for you.The game is meant for kids. So don't expect to be very difficult. But sometimes it's little frustrating. You must to have a Xbox 360 controler to play it. And there are some sound gliches. There aren't any achivements, so you don't need to worry about them. You need just to relax and have fun.

												Even though it has been designed with kids in mind, with the lack of adult themes, it did actually entertain me. It's  a very laid back hack and slash adventure that can be enjoyed by all ages. The combat is the weakest part as it is very simple compaired to most other games in the same genre. However the art style and Japanese setting is very nice to look at and actually it's simplicity makes it all the more enjoyable to play and explore. It tries to encoporate an open world design for each level while still being very linear, like the Crysis series there are different ways to approach and complete each goal. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who has younger kids to entertain, or has an interest in Japanese culture, or anyone that wants to switch off and kill a few hours. 7.5/10			",302,27,9,23,8,1,24

												I only started playing this today and I love it! 1. It's a cartoon but it is actually really pleasant to look at. 2. You can play as multiple characters (as you rescue them from the evil samurai guys...who are transformed forest animals.) 3. You can possess small woodland creatures (and some large..but mostly small.) 4. The world is really nice. I think I spent half an hour just looking around. 5.There are lots of things to collect, which is great for people like me who obsess over collecting everything possible. 6. The storyline is nice, so far. Con:The ninjas walk way too slowly. They can sprint, but you use up stamina.BONUS: It is currently on sale at humblebundle.com (where I got it.) So, paying as little as $1.00 can get you this game plus 4-5 others. ($1 minimum to get Steam Keys.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played this game before. When it was on the Xbox 360. Its a fun game with great storyline and fun missions.On PC however every 2-3 seconds i get aa stutter. I have a good computer that can run games like GTA V so i dont think my PC is the problem. The other issue i occured was the sound didnt play, it did for cutscenes, but after that no sound. If you dont have any of these issues, i would recommend this game stronglyEDIT: Downloading OpenAL fixed the sound issue. Unplugging my Logitech Headset fixed the stutter issue.			",44,9,1,3,4,0,0

												So I like the aspect of this game. You're a Ninja, well Mini Ninja. Mini ninja because you're a kid. Anyway! Ahem...This game is fun. Yes it does require some good hardware. It runs....fair on my Windows 10 tablet but I'd rather hold off on playing it for now. You can play with either Keyboard and mouse or with a Xinput compatible controller. Personally I prefer controller because it's easier to remember what does what rather than the keyboard method. My main gripe is that there are no achievements. I mean I know the game is old but it was on Microsoft's Games for Windows which was technically the old version of Xbox on PC. Ok enough with the history lesson. It's a fun game, the story is minimal, its half open world (the areas you explore are only accessible depending on the level). Would love to play more but someday.			",24,2,2,3,3,0,1

												Writing this for the “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award:This title didn’t have a huge marketing machine behind it, but just about anyone that finds it ends up loving it. Then you tell your friends about it. And they love it. And now that little game that could is my nomnation to win an award… but always remember: you totally found it first.This game when it was released years ago on the Xbox 360 was an absolute gem!!!  Not too hard, not rediculously easy, and just had all the ingredients that made this game fun to play!  Remember...when games were less demanding (even in achievements) and just FUN?  This game hails from the days of Conker and Banjo Kazooie like many other reviewers can attest but for some reason Mini Ninjas lacked the marketing and PR those games received.  It is a platformer involving stealth but the game is mechanically forgivable and although challenges do exist, it is not overly repetitive, too long in gameplay, or frustrating to complete.  The music and graphics also make this game an awesome couch game relax to and  play.  The current price it is an absolute steal and it is often in many Steam Sales over the holidays.  Back in my concole days - It was so good I gave it to my friend who had a son at the time.  Then I would watch father and son (and ocassionally mom) play this little treasure together family bonding and beating stages and handing the controller to one another as the game progressed.  The son was 5 but he loved this game, and it often served as good entertainment for the son in an opposite room while the parents, other friends, and I would hang out.  This little game is still fun. Even today, Mini Ninjas is just a precious zen-like little game that has this surprising ability to become cherished in the minds and hearts of anyone that takes the time to play it.  It is just that good! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even if you're not as obsessed with ninjas and japan in general, you just might like the easy to use and gripping combat system that allows you to use special attacks, work magics and switch between various different ninjas on the fly.

												A heartwarming adventure, beautiful graphics, clean looking, cute (and deadly) enemies, and tons of fun wrapped into one epic journey..... Mini Ninjas! Probably the cleanest and smoothest looking game I've seen in a long time. Each friendly character that one finds during the quest has their own unique and special moves. With tons of items, and sub weapons to use on those evil, cute little Mini Samurais and other creative enemies, this game defiantly deserves the ""Gore_Torn's Seal of Approval""!  It's worth a play and the wonderfully crafted worlds will immerse you in the ways of the Ninja!NINJA NINJA NINJA!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is pretty fun.Probably one of the few games rated for all ages that is worth playing.Great artstyle and sound gameplay which plays a bit like a simplified Ninja Gaiden with a two button attack system and a ninpo spell system. In terms of length, my first playthrough took around 9 hours to complete which isn't too long, but for the price, I got it for one, Mini Ninjas is a great game.Hopefully a sequel isn't too far off.

												This game is absolutely fantastic! I have 100% completion on my xbox and I am gunning for 100% on my PC as well! You play as a group of small ninjas who free animals from a curse and fight samurai men (who are the animals). I hope you liked my review :)			",142,18,8,24,11,1,16

												It has light platforming, combat is real time and fluid, you get special moves, you can sneak up on enemies, you get skills when you level up, and there is a crafting system.   You get 6 characters you can switch out (once you find them)the one small negative point is there is a bit of a learning curve on the conrols, but thats what the tutorial is for.  You can also remap buttons.all in all a bit of everything.  The cartoonish graphis put me off for a bit though.			",55,42,0,9,1,0,4

												I am often asked why I buy so many Steam games when so many of them turn out to be mediocre at best, and Mini Ninja's is the kind of diamond in the rough that offers an easy retort.  This game is truly a pleasure to play.  It has a unique game world, good voice acting, polished controls, stylish graphics and a wide variety of places to explore and characters to unlock to keep the gameplay varied.  The games difficulty is rather low making this a title that would be accessible and appropriate for kids, but     adults should find the experience rewarding as well.  Not only are widescreen and Steam Overlay supported, but the addition of controller support makes this titles and absolutely must buy addition to pretty much anyones game collection.

												An hour in, and this is already one of my favorite games. You learn many spells, and they arent any restore health or fortify health spells. They are cool spells, like  Possessing an animal, which you learn from the very beginning. You can possess bears to attack the samurai, or swiftly fly by them as a rabbit.  Also, as far as I know, nobody actually dies. It is better than most games worth $60, and for $10, it's worth it. This is a must buy for anyone.			",221,50,4,16,22,1,7

												In this game you can approach a situation in any way you want.  Charge in with various ninja weapons, or hang back and pick off samurai one at a time.  Hide in tall grass, or climb across the rooftops.  Running low on health?  Gather some herbs to make a healing potion, or jump in your straw hat boat and fish for some sushi.The game has a linear story, but each area of the game is rather open and free to explore.  I completed the story is around 7 or 8 hours, but the game does have some replayablitiy if you want to try different strategies throughout the game, or if you want to collect all the hidden stuff.

												Great game! This is a ninja game for all the families! Great art style, gameplay is simple, ( one button to attack and other to stun and break guard) but it can be more complex with the use of ninja techniques (acroll that are hidden on the levels), bombs, shurikens, lock and kill attacks and potions! You gather herbs/plants to craft potions! There are about 22 levels and a 15 level cap for the character. It's a easy game, even on hard but the final boss, if you are playing on hard and you don't own the time spell like me you can't kill him, and then I had to lower the difficulty on the last boss. There are one type of ninja enemies that are hard to kill I call them ""Monkey Ninjas"". You can swimm, use you cap as boat, sprint, wall run and move while hanging on edges. The story is good but it's so empty and simple, you only know of the story when you start and then when you finich the game with the narrator talking over images. Other thing, and I didnt mind about it, but still, could be like the last boss, is that the previous bosses are QTEs only. I enjoyed playing this game, I liked the mood and ambience of the levels and I think this game is aimed to the young ones more because of its cuteness.I would like to give it a 8 but I couldn't. Still a great game to play! They should make a sequel form this.Score: 7/10			",622,140,27,71,44,12,75

												A cute 3D platformer. Nice cartoon-style graphics and nice animation. The music and sounds match the setting well. The combat is simple but fun and never really frustating. This game won't challenge you too much but it makes a nice change to just play through for the story. Worth playing.			",345,139,3,58,33,3,38

												The scenery was decent and the fact that you can use a controller to play the game was a plus. But the game’s story is short and has an audio bug that also causes visual glitches which ruined some of the experience for me, and most definitely ruined the final boss fight for me. Not to mention that once defeated, you can accidently exit the ending cinematic so easily without a prompt or warning forcing you to defeat the boss again only to be able to watch it. I cannot recommend this game primarily for the audio-visual glitch, unless you goggle and manage to resolve it.			",155,16,0,13,6,0,1

												The game stutters while you have a keyboard plugged in. You may be able to get the game running, but you have to disable the keyboard from the device manager each time you want to play.

												This seems like a nice game at first, but the more you play, the more frustrating it becomes. I think I would recommend it when it was released, but not in 2017. The main issues are:- The content is pretty repetitive, almost all locations are similar and there are only a few enemy varieties- You have to mash A to do almost anything in the game (gather fruits, open doors, break free from enemy grasp, etc.)- Of course, the boss fighs are QTE based, and you have to mash A more- The combat system is pretty basic. Generally, you have to mash X and sometimes press Y to break a block- The camera is absolutely horrible. Seriously, it's one of the worst camera behaviours in all 3rd person view games I ever played (and I played hundreds of them)- The person who came up with escape from avalanche should have a personal place in hell- The last but not least, the game officialy supports only Xbox 360 Gamepad for Windows. If you have any other gamepad, you'll have to use x360ce or Xpadder. And don't even think about playing it with a keyboard & mouse!			",290,110,2,36,13,2,29

												Mini Ninjas feels like a throwback to the PSX and N64 era, with games like Banjo Kazooei, Super Mario 64, Medievil and so on.It's a 3D Action Platformer, designed to have open levels, with collectibles spread all over.While the game's description (on this page) is not entirely wrong, it can be deceiving. First off, if you're looking for a Stealth game, do not get this one. While stealth is possible, it's neither encouraged by the level design, nor very useful.The enemies are not designed to be approach silently, nor do the rooms have several possible entries and exits. It's not that type of game.It's more of a game designed for children, with a very lighthearted story, levels and Boss fights. Which isn't necessarly a bad thing.Let's talk about presentation first.Despite being a game from 2009, it's looks great!The cartoony style fits well with the game's vibe, and everything looks very clean and smooth. No complaints here whatsoever, except for the background's resolution. For some reason, their resolution is noticeable lower, and feels weird to look at. But it's a minor complaint!It achieves the japanese looks very well, and uses simplicity to its advantage.The music is also really good, and complements the theme perfectly. It's not something that will be stuck in your head or anything, though. It's ""merely"" textural music, that adds a lot to the atmosphere and feels quite relaxing.During the more action-driven sections, the Taiko drums will also come in for a decent adrenaline rush. Overall, pretty good!One issue, though. Sometimes, the sound would start glitching for no apparent reason, making the game sound like System Shock instead of a ninja/samurai-themed game. I don't know what caused it, but just take that in mind.So far, so good! Why am I not recommending this game, then? Well, the level design and game mechanics don't fit very well together, unfortunately, which leads to an experience that gets repetitive very quickly.First off, the combat is very button mash-y. You have a normal hit, and a heavier hit, to stun blocking opponents. You can also run and jump. There are very few possible combos with these attacks, as can be imagined, which makes every fight be very much the same. You'll also unlock spells and other ninjas throughout your journey, as well as potions.The different ninjas are a great idea, but their execution is very flawed. Each ninja has a different special ability, and weapon. These can differ in range, speed, damage, etc. There's a ninja with a big hammer, one with claws, one with a spear, a bow, etc. And this could have been used very effectively! But it's not. Why? Mainly, because the appropriate situations and placed right when you get said character. And you can use them there pretty well. But throughout the rest of the game, their usefulness is very limited, and you're better off just using the normal ninja. Spells are useful, and more fun to use on large groups of opponents, but very rarely are necessary. Only the basic ninja is able to use them as well, which further limits the other ones. (You can switch between them at will, but it's still not worth the hassle).The potions are also a big flaw in the game, in my opinion. With the exception of Health potions, you have absolutely no reason to use them! They're not useful, nor necessary at any point in the game. To that, add that you'll have to use them from the menu, which means pausing the game and looking for the right one. It simply breaks the pacing, without a benefit. You can use keybindings for some potions, but those will most likely be in use for the spells already.It could have been a great addition, but there are no situations that ask for the use of these potions, so it's just a game mechanic and is left unused throughout. A waste of space, sorry to say.You can either get these by finding them in the levels, buying them from vendors, or crafting them with plants that you'll gather. So, now that the main mechanics are out of the way, let's talk about level design.There are 22 levels, 5 of which are Boss Fights. In each of them, there are 5 things to look out for: Spells, Plants, Coins, Statues, and Caged Animals. Aside from reaching the end of each level, you may want to collect these items.This leads to levels being very open, with these items spread throughout. Unfortunately, unlike, say, Super Mario 64, none of the levels was very interesting. In Mario, every level had a lot of different content, with different areas, character, challenging platforming sections, racing, etc. etc. Every single level was crafted carefuly.In Mini Ninjas, the levels are mostly bland. The items seem ""hidden"" randomly, transforming exploration into tedious walking. Besides, there doesn't really seem to be any reward by collecting these. While you can use the plants for crafting, and coins to buy potions/tools, these are never really useful, so, once again, it's wasted space.The same goes with the caged animals, which you can free for kindness alone, without any reward.While some levels to have different sections, the game drags for too long, starting about halfway through it. There are river rapids and an avalanche sections, in which you'll have to dodge rocks and trees at a high speed, but aside from those, all the levels play very similarly. (They do look differently, though, so that's good. There are mountains, snow, rice plantations, etc. etc. decent variety)Enemy variety is also questionable. Some enemies require somewhat different approaches, but not something enough to provide challenge. I've played it on Hard Mode, and you can certainly steamroll through the whole thing without much of a problem. This, once again, leads to a not very interesting game.Finally, let's talk about the Boss fights.The last fight was great! You had to use the different spells at your disposal to beat him, which took a couple of tries to get the strategy. The other ones, unfortunately, were just a question of baiting them, followed by a QTE section.You would observe their behaviour, until you got what to do to ""unlock"" the QTE. And then just to the same thing 3 times and you're done. It's a shame. Boss fights can usually be really interesting and different, but this game didn't seem to seize that opportunity very well.I've written enough.While I feel that Mini Ninja's heart is on the right place, its execution leaves a lot to be desired. It could have been a very fun game if it had used all its mechanics appropriately, or simply making a more condensed experience.Since it doesn't, I can't recommend this game at all. Wait for A Hat in Time, perhaps, if you're itching for this kind of gameplay!			",473,130,11,42,29,3,58

												My thoughts on this game;Well, I got it because I had a demo version some years back. I feel a little dissapointed, as it's more of an exploritory beat-em-up than a ninja game. You are not really rewarded for stealth, in fact you are somwhat punished - you only gain XP / level up by killing enemies, and there are no real stealth kills possible.I also feel that the UI is somewhat clunky / made for consoles,  the camera doesn't always do what I want it to, and I can only select from 6 items at a time, when I may have 20 available to me, and I need to got through 2 sets of menus and then press another key to activate an ability.I do like how it slow-motions as you are selecting an ability, that's pretty cool.The other thing, is that the game story and progression feels very slow. I have not found any plot developments, and I'm 5h into this game. I'm just getting bored with it. There's nothing 'wrong' with it, it just doesn't feel like much fun.I also dislike how one of the coolestr things you can do (posess animals) is most useful with bigger animals, which are usually caged and heavily protected, you have to wipe out the enemies to get to the animals so that you can use them to... wipe out the enemies you just wiped out.So, basically, I got bored with this cutesy little ninja game about running in guns blazing.

												First off, i had this game for a while and finally decided to give it a go.  and i'm never going to play it again. not that its a bad game. is just poorly developed. here are my reasons for giving up even before i got started.1. no sound. the only sounds i would get were durring cinematic moments. to fix this i had to install OpenAL. since the OpenAL site is down. for seemingly forever, i had to use a copy someone in the Steam forums provided. After restarting my PC the sound worked in game. Ok, not a big deal i guess i can live with having to do some work.2. Stutter. I noticed every ~5 seconds the game would drop about 10 FPS. (i always have fraps running when gaming.) Not sure why i again take to the forums. Turns out its a common issue with HID devices, you either have to unplug your mouse and keyboard and use a xbox360 controller (i have one so no big deal, but i have a Dell T5500 and my USB ports are hard to get to so this isn't an option), or you have to monkey with your HID devices in Device manager, killing each one to find the one that is cause the stutter.  (this must be done each time you want to play). I'm not willing to let this get to strike three, so i'm going to mark this game as FAIL! un-install and forget i even have it. i doubt i could get a refund since i bought durring a sale long ago.such a shame, looked like it would have been fun.

												The idea of this game is pretty cool but I cannot recommend this game as I was never able to get any of the ingame sounds to work outside of the cut scenes. The game overall is a bit more on the childish side and the combat system is pretty big on the hack-n-slash idea. Hack-n-slash can be cool but I feel as if this game would have been better off if it had been implemented differently.			",187,30,6,20,14,2,39

												3/5 (must be at least 4/5 for me to recommend)Mini Ninjas really feels like a little kid game – but its actually somewhat hard so I don't think anyone under 10 is going to do well with it.  Maybe its suitable for 11 and 12 year olds whose parents won't let them play something rated T or M.  At any rate, its a platformer, you will need a controller as the PC controls are odd.  Another reviewer said it feels like the action games from N64 and PlayStation 1 – like crash bandakoot.  That's not entirely accurate, this game has so little charm to it.  Its a silly action platformer and for that, its a 3/5.			",242,61,10,29,32,0,23

												The game feels incredibly juvenile and the gameplay certainly shows. There's very little challenge involved in the game; the hardest part is actually the shoddy controls, not the content. The mouse and keyboard movements aren't very tight and quite a hassle overall. If you're over the age of 10, I would recommend another game.			",77,14,1,4,4,0,10

												This game has a story that is interesting only if you've never watched an old 90s cartoon before.  It tries to be enjoyably juvenile, but ends up being just regular juvenile.  This is also true of the combat where almost any situation can be taken care of with two button combat.  There are more advanced combat options but  the menus to utilize them are a headache and you'll almost never need them anyway.  I cannot recommend this game, though it seems like a lot of love was put into it there just isn't much refinement from a gameplay angle.			",140,55,0,40,8,1,23

												The game has known bugs with numerous systems where some people have found disabling every HID device in your Device Manager as a Workaround (10+ on my rig) .  The bugs have existed for years and apparenlty the developers are not doing anything to fix.  I've spotted users with GeForce 970 FTW w/ i7 gaming rigs having the same issues.  Sadly, they have a main.ini file with a ""UseGameController"" option but even if you remark that the game stutters like no other.  I really wish STEAM could make the publisher/developers pull their weight and fix the bugs so I could play this with my son.  I was kind of excited to find a game that he might enjoy.

												No sound and Graphics glitch every 5 seconds! What a shame!!!I bought two copies of this game. One for my son and one for me. A very neat looking game, cute story. But yes on both PC's there was no sound! Thank goodness for the sound fix posted, that fixed the issue. Than I experienced the previously discussed micro lag or glitching on my rig...Lol! the rig with the GTX 970 FTW gpu, and the i7 processor. It is the issue of the mouse and key board. The game must be played with a mircosoft type game pad and the glitching is gone, then it's quite the magnificent looking and playing lil game. A shame and absolute embarassment for the developers not to fix these minor bugs, and they abandon the comsumers once they have our money! I have a gaming buddy that will not buy from Edios what so ever, now I know why. Too bad, I have always been of fan of the Thief series and play the heck outta my guitars using thier Rocksmith 2014 software. But I commend and thank the STEAM Community yet again for being there for each other. Thank you for posting the audio download patch fix, and thanks for identifying; it's trying to play with a keyboard & mouse set up that cause the micro lag every 5 seconds.Game on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This Game is Plain BORING. DO NOT GET IT. It's a good thing I got this on sale for 2 dollars or else it would have been a major waste of money. There is no stealth aspect of the game. It is sometimes not clear where you have to go, or what you have to do. And you Can't get past any enemies without them knowing. So Much for a ""Ninjas"" Game. Its basically run,hit,fight, countinue story...... Not to mention, there is no sound for me(another downside, and its not my computers fault. It's a bug).Overall 1/10.

												This game should be pulled for misadvertising, because if you think a game solely about Ninja would contain stealth, then you'd be wrong. Sure, there are stealth mechanics, sure, some areas give you paths to sneak past enemies, but if you want to rescue animals and gain XP, the only way you'll do that is by charging in and killing everything you see. You in fact lose out if you stealth.This game is about as barebones as it gets. Despite being a linier game split into levels, the end of each level tell you how many collectables you managed to snag on your way there. This includes: freed animals, flowers, Jinzo statues, spell scrolls, and money. ""Great"", you might think, ""Lots of replayability!"" Well, you'd be wrong. Freeing animals gives you XP, collecting plants gives you ingredients with which to craft potions (which I have yet to need), scrolls give you new spells, and the statues? Well, they're purely collectables - all of which, as far as I can tell, have absolutely no reward for collecting them all. There are no achevements, either on Steam or in-game, and aside from your base stats which are improved automatically when you level-up, there isn't anything they could offer in the way of a reward anyway. And yes, you read that correctly: money is a commodity. It's that useless.Mini Ninjas is an empty, soulless (albeit cute) journey down a long woodland-themed corridoor, with no real incentive to stray off the beaten path besides completionism. Fighting is just mashing 'attack', with special attacks or spells that one-hit-kill. The only reason you'd need to switch characters is to kill the heavy enemy (which is only easily killed by your heavy ninja) or cast spells, which only the default character can. The English voice-acting also seems to be have been assigned exclusively to one guy.So what's good? Well, the art-style is lovely. The mixture of ambient Japanese dialogue and English cutscene dialogue is nice. You can control animals, which is oddly rare in games... And that's about it.CONCLUSION: It pains me to say this about anything in the Ninja genre, but I recommend giving this title a miss, unless you're buying it for a child - the cartoon violence, quirky designs and easy controls make this a good entry-level romp through ancient Japanese culture.

												It took me a while to decide whether to ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" this. It's definitely not a ""thumbs up"", I was sure about that. But is it worth a ""thumbs down""? Too bad there is no neutral vote.In the end, I went for ""thumbs down"". I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm close to the end (in the 'living castle'), and I may or may not finish it.The game doesn't start off bad; the style is fun, and I really like how my little guy reacts when he enters a boss arena.I even liked the bosses. This is rare, as bosses in most games tend to be just overpowered, frustrating garbage -- but the mini ninja bosses all work the same, and it's mostly a series of quicktimes that you just have to trigger in different ways and not fail 3 times. I can deal with that. Plus, you get that evil yoda cutscene at the end of the fight.However, things really went downhill when they introduced the last enemy type -- samurai that basically drain my health items since they are hard to kill and deal damage that usually can't be avoided because by the time you see that attack starting you're already in an attack of your own trying to take that guy down. Sometimes you even get two of these.Sow areas where annoying as hell -- with most of the drops being white, and the ground being solid white, things are impossible to spot. But that'smerely an annoyance. One of many, on top of those special samurai that don't show up all that often. Checkpoints are ""one use"", and once they introduced those samurai I didn't dare venture into unknown territory before activating a checkpoint.I also started to spend a lot of time moving animals out of range of those resurrection guys that I might be encountering. Especially animals that produce any kind of special samurai.As the game dragged along, doing the same things over and over and over again, always at risk to meet one of those almost unkillable samurai, I was finally getting into what seems to be the last level. Or close to it.Except that I get those uber samurai in dual packs now. Or in a situation where I'm not allowed to do anything, but they can rip me apart no problem. Unless I drop to the floor where hordes of other enemies are waiting for me, in addition to those special samurai who will be following me.Besides, I'm running out of health items... those guys need tons of them, and there are no fruits to be found in the castle so I can only use the few items that I have with me.I also have too many characters (""friends"") to choose from, without really knowing what they do. I've only ever used 2 of these -- one seems to be required to kill a certain type of enemy (or so the game told me), the other one has a ranged attack.So, in the end, it kept turning into a pain to move along, and I might not even make it to the end. I cannot possibly give that a thumbs up. ",520,154,17,67,43,8,78

												Fun game... played it on an AMD A8 APU and was very playable...Very nice graphics, fun to explore, fun to play... it's a 3rd person game with good action... you can change characters which each gave their own strengths...The only thing I didn't like was the last level... Typical big boss with all your powers combined...			",96,3,0,3,1,0,2

												Sure, it has got some really simple graphics (I really liked the graphics and the different settings) and the combat can be somewhat repetitive after some time... but for me that didn't make the game bad. I found the game to be fairly enjoyable, especially considering its length (~6-7 hours). Very underrated if you ask me.			",488,140,8,67,38,6,70

												A great little game. Has a simple layout with beautiful graphics. Fun for kids and adults. The openness of the levels is a bit large for hunting all the collectables, however, it leaves  those with an exploration itch plenty of sctaches. Enimies are easy but not one hit kills, and the options to use various forms is a plus. An overall great little game thats worth taking a look at.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I went in with very small expectations for this game.I was only going to ""try it out"", yet ended up playing almost 4 hours in one go.It's absolutely brilliant. If you can look past radial menues, annoying ""hints"" that pop up in your HUD during gameplay, and an ""antistropic filtering""-option that only seems to invert colours in the game, you've got a marvellous platformer with gameplay-mechanics that actually feel solid and smooth with keyboard and mouse.The graphics are very clean and stylized in an almost Nintendo-esque fashion.This game reminds me of all my years with Super Mario on the N64 and Spyro on the PS.Very much recommended.

												Pros+not a bad game and usually dirt cheap on sale so it's worth the money+played and beat it in about 9 hours+action and some stealth+no glitches to speak of for me (on a win7 64 bit)+felt challenging enough to enjoy but not so tuff to force me to quit in frustration+boss battles are more of a 'click in proper sequence' thing+content was probably meant for a younger audience but felt entertaining+cartoony graphics+main ninja uses spells and calls on the other ninja after he rescues them during the game+if you're stuck... use the archer - he's is OP vs most enemies (except Rocket Archers or anything in close range)cons (none are game breaking by any means)- forced camera angles in some spots was annoying and killed me once or twice-motion sickness from the camera jerkyness sometimes... had to play in shorter sessions-the boss battles sometimes were not clear on where to be positioned to start the button sequence stuff but I figured them all out eventually-escaping the avalanche... gahahahaha! It was awesome and frustrating for a bit but eventually clearabledecent short excursion worth a playthrough once... when on sale			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Family-friendly, doesn't take itself too seriously and features some beautiful landscapes. Mini Ninja's is just a good quick bit of fun really. Stealth, while certainly an option, is almost discouraged as experience is mainly gained by killing enemies, although stealth attacks do grant a large damage boost. There are a lot of different characters, abilities and tools/potions/weapons than aren't  strictly required, so you tend to stick to one or two tried and tested favourites and hardly touch the others, which is a shame.Boss fights feature quick time events, which I normally dislike, but they are very simple and the boss fights themselves are very silly.Overall, not amazing, not that challenging, but it's still got a lot of charm and I had a lot of fun playing it. Recommend playing this with a xbox controller (which I did) as it seems to have problems with other controllers.			",89,27,0,3,2,0,15

												I found Mini Ninjas to be a wonderful little Adventure game. The Enviroments and the OST are absolutely beautiful, and the Mouse & KB controls worked perfectly for me.      Cute and funny style, with decent combat, a small level up system. Several Characters to Unlock. A lot of Items to collect per level, which people either love or hate, and I LOVE IT! A nice calm little game to play. I don't remember if there are multiple difficulty settings. I had a few sound glitches at a couple random spots, but they went away fast. All in all, I highly recommend this game if you wanna relax and explore a beutiful world, full of silly baddies and cool areas to jump around/climb to.       Good times			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like ninjas, animals, cute things, and insanely beautiful natural environments, you'll probably like Mini Ninjas. It's a platformer/hack 'n slash with a surprisingly large variety of attacks, special abilities and playable characters.The art style is like a sushi buffet for the eyes. It doesn't let story get in the way of simple ninja-versus-army-of-samurai action. However, its greatest flaw is the lack of any real challenge. All enemies and bosses are weak and predictable, and your team of YAANGU NIINJYA start out with everything they need to kick butt, then proceed to get crazy overpowered. By the end of the game your main ninja pal learns some ninjutsu that kills everything in the area.If you play it, go into it expecting a charming experience, not a legitimate challenge. Basically a ""casual action game"". Whatever the heck that means.			",191,39,2,17,4,2,7

												Absolutely got my money's worth out of it. The minions are so funny, sort of like the grunts from halo. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. The level design is quite inventive at times. You can stealth your way through entire levels without anyone being the wiser, or you can run in and kill everything.The hidden items aren't as rediculous as some games we've all played, such as LoZ, and we put up with that. There are quick time events, exclusively in the boss fights, but they aren't that hard, and they aren't ""press space bar to not die"" like in GoW or Wet.8.5-9 out of 10			",203,54,8,23,11,0,23

												I initially wrote Mini Ninjas off as a kid's game. Along with that assumption came the idea that the gameplay mechanics would be simplistic, the levels would be basic and really guided, and that the game would be small, easy, and not worth bothering with.Along comes the Steam Winter Sale, and I figure that for a few dollars, I might as well check it out.This game completely blew me away!The first layer of gameplay complexity comes when you start rescuing your friends. You're enabled to switch between different characters with vastly different movement speed, attacks, and weaponry at the click of a button, even in the middle of combat. This opens up a whole new world of strategy as you can change your whole attack set in an instant.To further the depth, the game features a rudimentary crafting system. By finding various plants, you're able to craft potions which help you in your quest. They range from the basic health potion to the very useful Flame Oil (which makes your sword on fire).On top of the various potions, there are also purchaseable/scavengeable Ninja tools. These range from Shuriken and caltrops to various types of bombs. You even have a fishing rod you can use to fish for food/health.Finally, you have various Kuji Magic spells you can employ. These are very powerful and will come in handy constantly.You also have a hat, which acts as a basic shield to block incoming arrows. You also use it as a boat on water, and a sled on snow. There are a good amount of levels to explore, and exploration is encouraged as you need to explore to find all the Kuji magic spells and plants you need to craft your potions.The music and sound design is stellar. The world is very alive feeling, and is populated with believable sounds which form a detailed soundscape.Graphics are also wonderful, mixing careful detail with a very abstract painterly/paper style of art.The only issue I had was instability. That is easily fixed by finding and installing the OpenAL 2.1.0.0 runtimes. All of the earlier ones caused constant crashing on my computer.TLDR: Great game, way more depth than one would assume.

												Mini-Ninja's makes me smile. It makes me happy. It makes me gooey when I see all those sweet little animals. Even the enemies that kind of charge towards you singing ""ninja, ninja"" make me smile.And there you have it. It's fun. It's sweet. It's adorable. Is it too easy? Well, yes but I like easy.

												I bought this game during a sale for 2 reasons : it was 3 euros and i remembered vaguely reading about it in the past.after completing the game moments ago i am happy i bought it, it filled a nice chunk of my free time this past week and i enjoyed it greatly. even with the annoyances in the game:- camera when entering houses or certain corridors- hated samurai beeing annoying rather than hard to kill- super move beeing more or less overpoweredbut they dident have a giant influence on the fun the game brings along!the combat system was pretty straight forward altough mastery isen't that simple you can choose a ninja and stick to him and finish the game but choosing the correct ninja to fight each enemy will make it so much more fun to play! you should be constantly changing playstyles from slow and hard hitting to fast as hell or even ranged you have several ninja's at youre disposal and each has its pro's and cons. combine them to become great!all in all i give this game a 7/10 i immensly enjoyed it altough there where bits and bobs (i'm looking at you hated ninjas!) that just annoyed the living hell out of me!

												Mini Ninjas is a cute little adventure reminiscent of games like Insomniac's Spyro series on the PS1. Take control of one of five ninjas each with their own unique abilities and knock transformed animal demons senseless with some hectic ninja abilities. Voice work is excellent, as is the classic 3D adventure formula.			",100,20,2,14,7,0,11

												Sure, it has got some really simple graphics (I really liked the graphics and the different settings) and the combat can be somewhat repetitive after some time... but for me that didn't make the game bad. I found the game to be fairly enjoyable, especially considering its length (~6-7 hours). Very underrated if you ask me.			",488,140,8,67,38,6,70

												Have you seen those screenshots? This game is PRETTY. Designed to a tee and brimming with charm and character, every area is a visual treat and full of areas to explore as well as a beaten track. There's some collectables and hidden areas everywhere, and with the help of the local (and adorable) fauna, you can sniff out the neat sights. Enemy design is also helped by wonderful, wonderful voice acting, and excellent characterisation of what ultimately are faceless goons and mooks. The enemy commanders are so at odds with what you might expect from a distance, and it's a lot of fun every time you get to engage one alone.The mechanics are a little odd when you think about it. On the face of it, the combat is pretty shallow. You've got an attack, a guard-breaker/stun, a block, and a dodge roll. It's simple, hit things, if they start blocking, stun, if they start hitting, block or dodge. There's not a lot of nuance and it's very forgiving, especially for the main combat system. But then again, the actual grit of the system is a finely-tuned machine. Strikes work on actual physical contact rather than wide hitboxes, so it's entirely possible to say, dodge a spear thrust just by moving to the side, or knock arrows out of the air with good timing. You'd be surprised what you can do with the simple tools offered, which are healthily supplanted by a vast array of ninja tools, bombs and potions, as well as character-specific special moves.Once you start unlocking other ninjas, you'll find things start getting very interesting indeed. They all have their unique niche, be it crowd clearing, ranged attacking, going fast, heavy damage, whatever. You'll find yourself flipping between them with impunity, often using all of them within one conflict. They do overlap though, so often it comes down to favourites, but that's okay too because they're all great. The specials all have their own uses, but again, you'll find yourself playing favourites depending on your usual style.It's not a kid's game, but it is a kid-friendly game. It's not like, stupidly easy, but it's not punishingly hard either. As an example, your health doesn't regenerate, but in any given area there'll be several ways to heal, if you look around. You can catch fish, brew/find/loot/buy potions, search for food on trees and in bushes, and a number of items have healing side-effects. There's a lot of stuff to do in here, and it could be overwhelming, but everything in the game is approached with such... just, here's a bunch of stuff, go. There's no point at which you're forced to brew potions, nor is there a forced catching fish segment. Those things are just there if you want to do them, and that's great.I think one of the key ideas here is options. You've got a handful of characters, a couple dozen spells and items, a place to get to and enemies between you and it. After that, it's all up to you. Wanna sneak around the grass and pick off the sentries? Fine! What about assaulting with explosives and keeping your distance? Sure! Simply run in and start smashing things, chugging health potions as needed? Go for it! There's a million different ways to play every encounter, and all of them are fun. The ease on the eyes doesn't hurt it either, and it's always nice to come across the next area and gasp a little at how pretty it is.+A wonderful, pretty journeyCharming as hellOptions galorePlenty of length-Avalanche (Protip: Sprint)Would you like to spend a nice time on a beautiful adventure filled with cute characters and forgiving but fun combat?

												Mini Ninjas is a great game if you like simple exploration games that pose little challenge. However, it has flaws.I recommend Mini Ninjas to anyone who enjoys Zelda games or basic action games. The idea in Mini Ninjas is that you are a the final ninja in a town who is sent to do two things: rescue 5 other lost ninjas and defeat the evil samurai that has brought evil to the land. The villain has turned many of the forest animals into evil samurais; these samurais serve as your primary enemies in this game.For the vast majority of the game, you will be running and fighting through fairly open exploration levels. I say ""fairly"" open level because while they give the initial appearance of being quite large, this is pretty much an illusion. The levels are mostly quite linear and I do not believe I ever was lost about where to go. While that is nice, I do wish the game relied on a more typical Zelda-style open world instead of using actual levels. Yes, this game actually runs you through levels, with the primary purpose of the levels being to limit you to the current area/region you are in. Because of this, you only have one way to go back and collect the items you missed. Replay the level. This is not a good feature of this game because it comes with several kinds of items to collect(statues, freeing animals, finding plants to use, etc.). I enjoy finding items. I do not enjoy having to replay 45 minutes of gameplay because I missed one item. I will also add that you get absolutely nothing for collecting all of an item on a level. If you find every single Jizo Statue(one of the itesm) on a level, you get nothing. Zippo. Odd.One of the really neat ideas in this game is that you are a ninja who possesses a few unique  ninja powers. You can use stealth to sneak up on enemies and sneak-kill them or you can use a variety of spells to attack. You can even use ninja items like smoke bombs and shurikens to either distract or damage them. However, these unique ninja skills end up exposing a major design flaw in the game. If you don't kill the enemies, you do not get their experience, which you need to upgrade your character and grow stronger and more resilient. The game should have rewarded the player for being a sneaky ninja. It doesn't.Additionally, as you rescue your fellow ninjas, you get to swap between them and use their powers. Unfortunately, their powers are almost entirely useless and none of them can use magic. Therefore, despite rescuing 5 ninjas throughout the game you end up relying on your initial ninja for 95% of the game. 2 of the new ninjas we rescued remained entirely unused because they offered nothing to help me through the game. Disappointing.Well, I've gone and listed some major flaws in the game, yet I am still recommending it. Why? It's actually quite a bit of fun and actually plays like a first game in what would have eventually become a great series. All the flaws I've listed above could have been repaired in the sequels. Despite having weaknesses, I had a blast playing through most of this game. It helps greatly that this is the easiest game I've played in many years. Sometimes you want a challenge, but in a game like this, it actually helped that it was easy. It was very much a game that kids could play; even when you kill enemies in this game, they return to animal form instead of dying. I had a grin on my face a lot of times while playing this game because it has a great sense of whimsy, wonderful art direction, lovely music, and smooth enough gameplay. Despite critiquing it, it was a lot of fun. Let me end by focusing entirely on the positive. While majorly flawed, the game saves itself with its incredible charm and bubbly personality. Combine that with little to no challenge and you have a lovely family-friendly game. I still enjoyed collecting items despite there being no purpose and I even liked fighting the enemies even though there was little skill involved. The game took me 11 hours to beat, though You could reduce that time by 25% if you don't bother to run around and take it all in. This game provided a very nice experience and was well worth the 11 hours I put into it. Had the game been a 25+ hour game, it would have severely hurt its rating, but for a pretty short game, it was nice. I will add one final minor beef, though. Where are the Steam Achievements? The game had a achievements on the Xbox 360 and PS3. Why were those not copied over to Steam? My final rating of the game:6/10 - Nice, but flawed. I wish there had been sequels that repaired some of the issues.			",115,51,6,19,11,0,15

												Mini Ninjas is a cute little adventure reminiscent of games like Insomniac's Spyro series on the PS1. Take control of one of five ninjas each with their own unique abilities and knock transformed animal demons senseless with some hectic ninja abilities. Voice work is excellent, as is the classic 3D adventure formula.			",100,20,2,14,7,0,11

												NOT SUITED FOR CHILDREN UNDER 10 YEARS. PLUS:The game looks gorgeous. The game mechanics are well done and responsive (boss fights up until now are very simplified with hitting the space bar, left and right mouse button as shown on the screen - does divert from the visuals of the battle). The enemies are quite easy to beat (from the perspective of a nearly 40 year old) - kids might have problems with the boss-fights though. Nice story. Not too redundant. MINUS: Only one female Ninjette.No double jump. Would have made the game an eternal gem. My advice: JUMP and NEUTRALIZE - fastest and easiest way.Information about the game-length: about 8 to 9 hours. If you really collect everything and shake every trees´ apples or cherries and every bushes´ berries it will be way more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I found Mini Ninjas to be a wonderful little Adventure game. The Enviroments and the OST are absolutely beautiful, and the Mouse & KB controls worked perfectly for me.      Cute and funny style, with decent combat, a small level up system. Several Characters to Unlock. A lot of Items to collect per level, which people either love or hate, and I LOVE IT! A nice calm little game to play. I don't remember if there are multiple difficulty settings. I had a few sound glitches at a couple random spots, but they went away fast. All in all, I highly recommend this game if you wanna relax and explore a beutiful world, full of silly baddies and cool areas to jump around/climb to.       Good times			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
