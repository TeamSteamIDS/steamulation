												FOR THOSE HANGING AT THE LOADING SCREEN WHERE IT SAYS ""TYPEMANAGER"" AND STUFF IN THE RED BAR: GO INTO YOUR CONFIG.EXE IN SACRED FOLDER IN STEAM AND CHECK THE ""32 BIT COLOR DEPTH"" OPTION. SHOULD FIX NP.IF YOU ARE HAVING LOW FPS PROBLEMS ON MODERN MACHINES, GO INTO YOUR SETTINGS FILE and change  TO THESE VALUES:Settings.cfg------------------------GFX_LIMIT128 : 1GFX32 : 0FULLSCREEN : 0FSAA_FILTER : 0------------------------YES YOU WILL HAVE TO RUN IN WINDOWED, BUT YOU CAN JUST SET YOUR DESKTOP RESOLUTION TO 1024x768 TO GET THE GAME TO FILL YOUR SCREEN, IT IS HARDCODED INTO GAME AND YOU CANNOT CHANGE IT.ONTO THE REVIEW....Regardless of what people say, it reminds me of an *updated* Diablo 2.One of the things I didn't like about D2 was the linearity of the game, here that is taken out in favor of exploration.The combat is iffy. Once you get used to it, it's not bad. No worse than D2's, really.Lotta customization, and the classes feel unique. Quests, quests, and more quests! One thing that was kind of a drag in D2 was that each act only had a handful of quests.And the loot? Plenty of it!If you liked Diablo2, you will like this.And for $2.49 on sale, you can't go wrong.9/10 (minus 1 for having to do all that trouble shooting for it to work, but really, that's not the game's fault)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You didn't play Sacred back in 2004? You missed probably the best Diablo-clone out there. That's why fans where so dissapointed about Sacred 3 release. But we are reviewing the original game, so here we are.Sacred Gold is a lassic action RPG where you slash and loot and slash and loot and slash and loot and take some random quests in between. Steam edition includes every single patch ever released, including some Sacred Plus stuff and Underworld campaign. Also the latest 2.28 patch removed the Starforce DRM, which is awesome.The map is huge, the area you'll uncover in an hour will only take 1% of the whole map. Since this game is actionly 2D, you might think the graphics are way off and the screenshots here might prove it, but it's just steam stretching, cutting and smoothing the image. If you click it, you'll see it's more sharp and actually has some HUD. Also, all screenshots here present the massive close up on the character. While it was the issue back in 2004, I think the developers added the option to zoom out way farther with some patch, so now you can actually see stuff around. The only problem is that the game is locked on the low 4:3 resolution and never was patched for the wide screens, but it doesn't really feel so bad as in some other games. However, having 1080p and actual smoothing would be nice...The official online servers are down, but you still can play this via Tunngle or another LAN emulator. You might face a certain issue with error 10026 which is not explained anywhere, but in the tutorial I posted here on Steam. Check it out if you'll ever face this issue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Graphics - 4 / 5The graphics may not offer super realistic lighting, shadows,or even decent effects.. But it still looks clean,and comes together very nicely.Sound - 3/5The quality of the sound & music in Sacred is quite horrible,to say the least, it's not bad enough to be game breaking,but it's certainly annoying.Gameplay - 5 / 5Sacred offers hundreds of quests scattered in a humongous world.which you can explore with up to 8 different classes,each class changing the beginning of the storyline campaign.Multiplayer - 5 / 5 (LAN only since online servers are now put down)While the online multiplayer was still alive, it was second to nothing.The entire game is available as co-op/pvp with up to 16 players.I give this game a 5 out of 5.Because it's not always about shiny graphics and HD sound quality.It's the gameplay that makes this the best open-world RPG ever made.

												I just bought this and am running win10. The game froze after the initial game company and nvidia intros. Froze on loading the main title screen. I immediately browsed to the Sacred Gold application launch icon in my steam library and tweaked it and got it running. I don't really prefer this method as launching from steam library or the desktop icon still produces the bad result.Then I saw the Config application icon which was the best answer to my issues.Fix the game like this-Right click Sacred Gold in your library-Choose Properties-Choose Local Content tab and select Browse Local Content-Scroll down to the Config application Icon and select it-Check the ""32 Bit Color Depth"" and ""Video Compatibility Mode"" boxes-Exit with OKYou should be good to go now.I am just trying this game for the first time. Too bad I missed this one back in the day... seems to be a real gem. No time like the present I guess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is just amazing! It has everything that most other RPG games doesn't have.It's an entire open world so there is much to explore.The Gold version is the full version of the first installment of Sacred.Imho Sacred 1 is still the best.A lot of  loot, A lot of items and quests and sidequests. A lot of enemies.Easy keyconfigs.Although the graphics are oldschool this version is still the best and the most fun.There is a possibility to buy a horse which was an amazing feature for RPG games in that time.Warning to windows 8.1 users: Google for what you have to do to make it run in Windows 8.1 It's very easy because the config.exe is already in the game under Programfiles -> Steam-> Steamapps->common->SacredGold			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Welcome to the world of Ancaria, where basically everything is hostile, except you go into a town. Hack'n'Slay your way through a gigantic open world, with tons of small dungeons, side quests and a nice story line.Sacred Gold comes with the Underworld DLC including two new heros for Ancaria, the Demon and the Dwarf, and a lot more world to explore.

												I first played this game almost 10 years ago and it's still one of my favourite action RPG-s. Good variety of classes and skills, really huge world with many different zones and secrets, detailed graphics, easter eggs, fun and fast combat, loong gameplay...Just keep in mind one thing: don't take this game seriously. If you want an epic story, cool cinematics or varied quests, find something else. This game is only about fun and in this case fun means slashing thousands of enemies in a world that embraced every single fantasy clich√©, while you read hilarious recipes and look for the new piece of your armor set.

Posted: February 22, 2015
												Simple categorized review:Looks: The graphics haven't aged well (pixels), period. However, the art style is pretty nice and the spell animations are still quite beautiful. This game needs a remastered version! 5/10Story: I don't expect much of a story from this kind of game and I don't receive it, this is definitely what you neither should want the game to give to you. There is a story and the characters are likeable, at least the devs tried and got you some funny dialogues, always a goal in mind and, admittedly, even twists. It's better than in Torchlight 2 for example. 5/10Gameplay: Rather slow-paced hack'n'slay, compared to Diablo and Torchlight. The characters can be handled comfortably while sometimes the menus feel clumsy and outdated. Combat is fun, especially when you try out the many types of weapons and sorts of magic. The flow of the game is very good all in all, and with character progression and tons of loot you got to try out various play styles in a single play-through. 8/10 Character classes: Eight unique classes (two from the expansion) that feel and behave very distinctively. The war/combat-mage-hybrid is arguably the most fun character class in video game history when it comes to preset ones. Even then, there is a lot of customization to be done, skills to experiment with and tactics (especially in later new game plus). The balance has no flaws, in my experience, and you just wanna try out every character with every single play style. 10/10 Complexity: This game is deep, even deeper than your first play-throughs will make you think. New game plus holds a bunch of surprises later in the game and weapons and skill runes work together in a perfectly balanced and intriguing system, though the game is not hard to learn. You get into it and discover what it has to offer over time. Equip sets, customization, smart combining of equip and skills, varied enemies that need different approaches to be defeated, lots of secrets, skilling needs to be thought through thoroughly unless you wanna be smitten later in the game...The game is as complex as one would expect from a good RPG with focus on looting and leveling. 10/10World: The world is huge, diversified and has tons of secrets to show to an attentive adventurer. Monster types are far from being copy-paste and the art style is nice, as mentioned somewhere above. The problem is that it might become a repetitive experience in later play-throughs, without level-generation (- except from the highest difficulty mode that holds surprises, as I also said earlier on.) The settlements and castles deserve to be emphasised when I talk about the world, they are big, you can enter every building and they are full of stuff to do and see. Also, the world isn't vast at all. In Torchlight, for instance, I miss a huge map showing me the land that I shall care about and defend. 9/10Quests: Several quests are humorous and most of them are nicely written. Unfortunately, there is much stuff to be fetched, quests just lead to new areas and actually earn you very juicy rewards. There's quite a lot of quests to do, you can just do them on the run and have a good grin here and there when you track down someone's rabbit or speak to the ""more simple"" folks. Sometimes you make decisions. 7/10 in a game of this genre.Price: 10 $ or 2.50 $ on sale, pretty good deal.Replayability: I bet you won't discover everything there is to see in the game during your first play-through, or in the second, or third. At least you will want to try out different character classes and/or play styles. Expect the game to let you grind monsters for a couple of minutes here and there in new game plus, that can be a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•if you're out for the best set equip. My 26 hours on Steam so far have been one play-through of the first campaign as an experienced player for nostalgic reasons (and trying to get the multiplayer to work), I could leave out a lot of stuff I didn't want to do for the tenth time. You can easily waste one hundred hours or more in this game - on one high-level character, that is. In later play-throughs, your equip and skills still really advance fast and give you the feel of becoming more and more powerful even after countless hours. 8/10Multiplayer: Online is dead. You can get it to work on LAN, however, up to four players if I recall it correctly. It then works absolutely fine, but it's not comfortable to set up. 1/10This game is the best of its genre, in my humble opinion, and a cult classic. You should play it. I will ignore my listing and give it a 10/10. Alright, there IS nostalgia involved. The metascore of 74 is reasonable. Give it some points up if you like this type of game and have fun in a game that is rather generic fantasy but excels by having great gameplay, complexity, character classes and an interesting open-world.

												It has a Diablo or DnD click to move hack and slash play style but is completely open world, and I love that!  Very simple and mindless, easy to learn, but with challenging bosses to randomly come across and lots of interesting monsters and quests.  Lovely and diverse landscapes and regions which are fun and rewarding to explore and a decent storyline and lore to uncover as you progress.  It's pretty cheesy sometimes and mechanics (if any lol) are very generic, occasional glitchs here and there, but I still really recommend it if you want something calm and slow paced.  I can play for hours and be perfectly content, definitely one of my favorites for it's simplicity.  :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a treasure for a action RPG fan like me. When I launched it for the first time, I instantly got engaged in the event of Ancaria. World in Sacred is very well crafted, rich and detailed, combat is solid and engaging. RPG elements might look simplistic from the first sight, but believe me, they aren't game has quite a bit of depth into it including very well developed and variet classes (there are 8 of them) and a very interesting skill progression.Sacred has a multiplayer for up to 16 players, which is quite a big scale compared to other RPG titles, though, it's only playable through LAN, but after all, there are plenty of VPN applications that can solve that problem. I can srongly recommend this game for all the classic hack and slash fans out there, you will be satisfied with amount of monsters to kill and items to loot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Then open Config.exe. Run the game in 32 bit color depth, filter active and video compatability mode, finally untick Play Movies. Now right click the Sacred.exe file and run in compatability mode for Windows XP. Should work.You're welcome.Games a classic. 5/7. A Perfect Score			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Score: 4/5; I recommend Sacred GoldPC; Win 8.1/10 64-bit; Sacred Gold v2.28completed; playing time: 147 hrsNote: If you experience problems with launching the game, go to the Sacred Gold main folder and find the Config.exe file. Run it, and check '32 Bit Color Depth.' Otherwise, the game will default to run in a 16-Bit-Color-Depth mode, and will probably freeze during loading, or crash. Sacred Gold v2.28 ran on my 64-bit Win 8.1 and 64-bit Win 10. I did not use compatibility mode at all. However, the game frequently crashed, so I had to quicksave quite often...Pros:+ Several characters to choose from, each with his/her distinctive advantages and drawbacks+ Replayability: characters start in different locations, have different backgrounds, and some different quests+ Numerous weapons, armour types, spells, items, and whatnot...+ Countless ways of developing your character during gameplay (by developing favourite skills, attributes, and combat arts, as well as modifying properties of your armour and weapons...)+ You can create combos+ In addition to the traditional swords and bows, there are firearms, muskets, and mines...+ There is a huge area to explore+ There are a great number of quests+ There are portals to facilitate travel between distant areasCons:- You only play as one character and can't create a permanent team. Sometimes an NPC may join you, but only temporarily, and you can neither control him/her nor have access to his/her inventory- Monster respawning can sometimes be a real pain in the neck... There's too many of them, too often...- The manual doesn't explain some aspects of the game well. Before you commit yourself to playing the game seriously, it's a good idea to read some extra information on how things work and how to develop your character on the Sacred wiki or find some good forums- Although the expansions - e.g. Sacred Underworld - introduce some interesting areas and quests, my overal impression was that they were worse thought out than the base game, with fewer good-quality quests or areas- A few quests broke becasue I accidentally started them ""from the end,"" e.g. I found an item at the beginning before a quest was officially initialised; then, when the quest officially started and I was supposed to find the item, the game acted as if I had not found it, even though I already had it. The result was I couldn't finish the quest. However, I experienced very few quests like that (2 or perhaps 3...)- Remember that it's a 2005 game, so graphics are a little datedTo conclude, despite a few problems, it's a solid RPG worth getting and spending hours of your life playing it.

The Goodan unbelievably expansive, mostly open world that invites (and rewards) explorationan overwhelming amount of side questsa broad selection of playable characters/character classes, most of which offer a very distinct gameplay stylegorgeous and exceptionally detailed 2D backgroundsmountable horses and dwarves with guns... may not sound like anything special nowadays but back in my day it was the bomb, I tell ya!The Mehthe enemy selection/bestiary is rather bland; among the orcs, goblins, skeletons, dragons, spiders and, of course, humans, it's very rare to see any original enemy designs that you haven't seen many, many times before in other gameshaving to depend on dropped runes for the development of certain character abilities (like spells and special moves) might irritate some playersfinding a proper path to your targets on the map can sometimes be a bit more difficult than you'd expectthe portal system is unnecessarily restrictive; instead of town portal spells or scrolls that can be used at any time, teleportation is limited to a rather small number of portals you find all across the worldthis is more of a personal peeve, but I have never liked Sacred's main story; I think it's convoluted, draggy and rather boring, to be honestThe Uglyeven after all these years and with all patches installed, it's still possible to accidentally ""break"" certain quests or run into other minor bugs; frequent saving is advisedOverallWhat had been an absolutely amazing game that blew me away on release has held up admirably well over the years. Revisiting Sacred now after having played many of its modern competitors, I can say that its charm hasn't faded all that much. It might come off as a bit archaic initially, and it certainly has its quirks, but the world is still as massive and open and with all its countless side quests, secret caves and hidden treasures still as much fun to explore as I remembered. Ultimately, it's an incredibly addictive experience that'll keep completionists occupied for a very long time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A surprisingly good game.  Though the plot and setting are as generic-Fantasy as it gets, the game's mechanics make it surprisingly addictive.  An Open World Diabloesque, Sacred manages a good balance.  It provides plenty of exploration and side-questing, without detracting from the main plot.  The difficulty can be a little spikey in places, but good loot is frequent enough to help smooth some of those edges.  Builds are relatively easy to construct, though the game has a few gotchas that could have been better explained.  While not the best in the genre, it is surprising this did not get more exposure in its day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I played over 50 campaings I've finished them with all champions especially with Battle Mag , Dark Elf or Wood Elf. I remember that before full game I had a demo , the end of game was finished when I wanted to leave Silver Creek ( second village ) , there were only Seraphim and Gladiator.Nowadays , I like to play with friends via Tunggle in that game on ""veteranen"" mode. In sum I spent over 1000 hours in that perfect game. I hope u'll like it.Greetings , Chriz			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I used to play Sacred roughly 10 years ago, before the expansion pack or Sacred Gold even came out. I was absolutely in love with it, and spent ages playing.The world of Ancaria always had a special place in my heart, so I decided to buy it again now and get back into it.It is true that getting it to start on Win 8.1 needs some arrangement, but this is fairly easy and you can do it in about 15 minutes maximum. (The description will be at the end of this review.)Now, on to the game:When looking at this game, we need to remember that it's a decade old. Even with that in mind, it is still much better than some RPGs that they put out today. There are 8 characters that you can use: Gladiator, Seraphim, Wood Elf, Battle Mage, Dark Elf, Vampiress and 2 that came with the Underworld expansion pack: Daemon and Dwarf.They each have pros and cons, and various combat arts. I have played with all of them, my personal favourite is the Dark Elf. (I prefer a more aggressive approach, no shields or two handed weapons, instead dual wielding+poison+fast attacks and traps) The map is huge and there are various kinds of lands to discover. (Tundra, desert, forest, underworld etc.) There are portals throughout the map to help you navigate more easily. There are tons of missions, named and unnamed sidequests which will occupy completionists for a long time. There are 5 difficulty levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Niobium) The ones after silver only become available if you completed the game with the previous difficulty level. Advancing through the levels is necessary to face some real challanges, especially after you character is moderately leveled. The level cap is high (216, if I'm not mistaken) which means you can finetune your character as you wish. There is A LOT of loot, which is both a good and bad thing, as it can be overwhelming. I personally find having all these options very entertaining. There are set items, which if you wear together gives you really good bonuses. You get to have companions throughout the game (some immortal, some can die) and although they are not usually very strong, they still provide some support. You get to have a horse. I love games that gives me access to animals. (Also the Vampiress has a wolf and 2 bats) The horses have many different stats, the most important one being speed. Also, they can ram opponnents, which is useful especially if you are cornered while on horseback. Mounted combat is also an option. The characters have many spoken lines (Which is important in my opinion, for example Dragon Age: Origins -another game I really like- only has a couple of lines for the player controlled character, which get really boring to hear after a while ""Can I get you a ladder, so you can get off my back?"" Ugh.) There are TONS of pop culture references all over the world. I strongly recommend going grave-robbing. I have found 3 easter eggs by myself, and have read about others. So go exploring off the beaten track. The graphics are not the best, but considering how old the game is, I think it's pretty good. It's enjoyable.Overall: The game has interesting characters, huge world and mythology to discover, entertaining sidequests and storylines, good leveling mechanic and a lot of items to work with. I bought the game on a sale, but I still think it deserves the price it has now.Don't bother with any other Sacred games though, this one is the best. It all goes downhill from here.And here is the Windows 8.1 guide, ask if you need help with any of the steps.[/b] Update your graphic card drivers. Go to the Local Files of the game.(Right click the game in your library, click properties, then local files, then browse local files) There are 4 exe files there (config, game server, sacred, testapp). Change all of their settings so that they Run as Administrator always, and that they run in compatibility mode to Win 7. Click the ""config.exe"" and select ""32-bit"" and ""video compatibility mode"" They need to be checked. Enjoy the game!At first the game didn't run for me, and after that I had a graphics glitch. They were both fixed by these steps. There are some alternatives, ask if you wish. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sacred was the first game to introduce me to the Hack n Slash genre. That's right, I never played Diablo at the time even though I'm old enough to should have been doing that back then. But somehow I skipped it and it was this game that taught me what I was missing out on, and then some. Highly addictive gameplay, appealing graphics (there is something about the grittiness of Sacred 1 that I really prefer to its smoothed out successor), badly voiced but fun characters. It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time may provide some challenge, especially early on if you want to advance too far too soon. The skill progression is simple yet diverse. The difference in skills and weapon use are well implemented; each character does feel unique. After finishing the main Ancaria campaign (which took ages since I felt I had to explore every inch of the map)  I must admit I didn't have much interest left to complete the Underworld campaign. To me it didn't feel as a real part of the game, both storywise and mapwise. But I do love the two extra characters, they are both my favorites to use. The demon's spells are interesting to play around with (more then just your common fire ball, you'll need the battle mage for that kind of work) and the dwarfs cannon gun and use of mines is quite satisfying.I like both Sacred and Sacred 2, but this is the game that will remain somewhat special to me. Even though by now I do understand what Diablo (1 & 2) is all about. So yes, of course I would recommend this game, play it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whether singleplayer or with a group of friends, the old classic action rpg ""Sacred Gold"" is still lots of fun to play and still one of the best games of its genre. A huge vivid open world with lots of secrets to discover encourages traveling around and exploring, the character development is highly customizable with Combat Arts, self-selected Skills and Attributes. Apart from usual randomly generated loot, there are uniques and set items which encourages collecting, and equipment in general has so many different possible modifiers that you can highly customize your character in so many different ways. There are five difficulties, you unlock the next higher one by beating the game on the previous. Each difficulty makes enemies deal a lot more damage and become tougher, but also improves the loot you can get from them. The game gets extremely hard on the highest difficulties.I don't have this game in Steam for long, played it many houndreds of hours before (probably far more than 1000 hours over the years, actually), it's just awesome. I'd say it's even worth the standard 10‚Ç¨ price but this is  debatable, at a sale though I can only fully recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sacred franchise review!:  I have many MANY hours on the Sacred games, GOLD and Sacred 2. Sacred Gold i have on disk and i decided to buy the steam version(because $2.50 is why!). I would put this up there as one of the best hack and slash/RPGs of all time!!. Same with Sacred 2 which i spent countless hours on PS3 with. Sacred GOLD and 2 i would probably even rate over the Diablo 3!(which i spend most of my time on these days)). For such a small company like Ascaron(Now bankrupt) It was an amazing game!. Sacred GOLD is like Diablo  but  with a Skyrim world where you just explore a HUGE world and questing,Leveling up,Finding items ect!. None of this 1 way maze crap. Sacred 2 was about 300 hours in total for the main quests but soooo many more side quests!. Also 200 lvls which takes easily 500+ hours to hit max LVL. Sacred 3 i am looking forward to a lot after seeing some gameplay!. I have been waiting since they mentioned it back in 2009!. I don't know much about Keen Games(sacred 3) but as for Deep Silver they are a great company but lately have been releasing HEAPS of broken games that are getting really low ratings! :(. Lets hope Sacred 3 is not one of them!!.Anyone who enjoys hack and slash RPGs MUST have both Sacred GOLD and Sacred 2 in their collection!.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is one of the large turning points when it comes of gaming in my youth. As a child I probably spent more than two hundreds of hours in this wonderful game - together with Pok√©mon, it's probably the biggest reason why I am now a huge fan of the RPG genre. Seriously, lads - If you're liking old 2D-sprite drawn RPG games with a capturing story and decent and creative mechanismns, then you're not making a mistake picking this game up.Only thing I regret is that the regular Steam version doesn't have the good ol' German voices and texts that made the whole atmosphere even more thrilling. Buit, then again, there are loads of community-made voice packs for me out there - and the ones that are reading this and don't speak German won't be affected anyway.However, if you're able to understand German, please do consider installing at least the communuity German Voice pack, maybe even the text replacements.It may very well be the nostalgia speaking from my heart, but I'd rate a solid 9/10. If you're into retro, that is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good old Sacred - must have played that game for years and damn, I lost the CD and forgot that game. Found that game on sale, bought it (again) and so here's my review after I wasted again about 20 hours of my life in this game:+ addicting (I mastered every class in that game..)+ big map (Dwarves cannot ride ._.)+ great soundtrack+ retro bomb (Ooooh, the souvenirs)+ lots of easter eggs and other stuff to discover+/- the ""new"" Dwarves and Daemons are a bit op (still gg)+/- multiplayer, buuuuut not that easy to figure out how to get that thing running (Thank god, there are guides on steam)- rather repetitive quests - sometimes absurd animation of movement- some little problems with compability, but runs well on Vista and 10, no performance problemsBest goblins ever - screaming random things like ""Schniepel"" (what is actually a rather uncouth word for‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, ""Holla Lieschen!"" (a cry of surprise) or ""Hackt ihm den Kopf ab, ich brauch 'nen neuen Aschenbecher."" (Cut his head off, I need a new ashtray.)10/10, still the most addicting arpg I ever played. Would play again. And again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Creeping slowly and stealthily under the shadows of many contemporary upcoming games, Sacred never really generated much media hype prior to its release. What we have on our hands here, folks, is an action RPG coming from European development team at Ascaron Entertainment. Sacred uses the all too familiar design pattern long-establish by Blizzard's original Diablo. Basically, you have your average heroic fantasy tale, an ultimate evil unleashed by a dim-witted wizard, tons of monsters to mow down, and plenty of quests. More than anything else, this game focuses on character development and classic hack'n'slash gameplay. Still, you will find a bit more than that, so I'd advise you to read on.Coming up with a decent and innovative fantasy-style storytelling is definitely a difficult task these days. So, in all honesty, it would be deceitful to claim Sacred entails an exciting plot. Players are presented a rather basic and straightforward fantasy-themed storyline. The introduction sequence offers precious little to let you know exactly what the hell is going on. An evil wizard Shaddar summons an ancient evil and unleashes its devastating powers upon the Kingdom of Ancaria. Someone, naturally, has to put a stop to the chaos and disarray engulfing the unfortunate inhabitants of Ancaria. The first couple of quests won't reveal much of the story either, I'm afraid. In other words, it's actually pointless to seek some deeper meaning in the narrative since it remains somewhat scarce and incomplete throughout most of the game. But, believe it or not, the omission of a profound tale never appeared to bother me much during gameplay, given that all my attention was directed towards tearing monsters apart and leveling up my character. There were also some surprising moments of humor in the game. Opening graves and crypts, for instance, prompts amusing lines like, ""In memory of all the monsters we have killed for experience points."" The developers weren't too lazy to throw in a little something for Lord of the Rings fans. A certain stone ruin marked the following words: ""Et Earello Endorenna utulien..."" - for those of you who watched Return of the King, this is the beginning of the verse Aragorn sang at the end of the movie. This has nothing to do with the game, but it's still a nice and fun touch for all fantasy fans.At the beginning all you have to do is select one of the six available characters: a robust sandal-wearing Gladiator, a mysterious Battle mage, a sharp-witted and sinister Dark Elf, a light-hearted and valiant Wood Elf, a charismatic Seraphim, the tempting Vampiress, and the dark yet sultry Daemon. Each class concentrates on a unique combat style, either through magic and ranged attacks, or via melee attacks. The Gladiator, Battlemage, Dark Elf, and Wood Elf, offer a pretty standard range of abilities and skills we've already experienced in games like Neverwinter Nights, Diablo, Dungeon Siege, and so on. The Seraphim, Vampiress, and Daemon however, involve a few pleasing novelties combined with classic RPG character advancement. Although I was pleased with the statistics and overall appearance of all races, I somehow felt drawn towards the incredibly alluring Vampiress (what can I say, I just cannot contain my bloodlust anymore). Also, I got a bit fed up with spells, bows, and throwing knives, so this was just right... for me anyways. I'm sure all of you will find what you're looking for in other character classes, since they're all quite suitable for various styles of play.I think most RPG fans would be interested to know more about the regions of Sacred. The most commendable aspect of the game is the elimination of loading areas. Up to 70 % of the existing world map is accessible at the beginning of the campaign which comes as most appreciated gameplay element and allows players to choose multiple paths towards their primary destination. Another helpful addition is the world map which specifies exactly where your character can locate blacksmiths, merchants, etc. Additionally, each initiated quest is highlighted on the map, so there's no chance of getting lost even if you wanted to. There are many helpful additions to the gameplay. Each town, for example, features a chest in the center where low-level characters may lay down extra items which can be used later on during the game. If you find a ring, sword, or any other item you don't have enough experience to handle, just store it in one town and then pick it up in the next when you've leveled up the character. The journey between the towns should give you enough experience points so you can upgrade to the next level.Using the interface and inventory system should be a piece of cake for any gamer. Everything ran smoothly - upgrading general skills and specific combat abilities can be done quite easily, which also goes for exchanging items, upgrading weapons and armor, etc. As for the controls, about 80% of the game boils down to mouse-clicking (well, as you'd expect it from any Diablo style RPG). Apart from solving quests and slashing your way through swarms of goblins, orcs, gargoyles, thieves, assassins, and other baddies, the game will have you concentrating on using the most out of your character's capabilities. Beefing up armor and weapons is not the only thing you get to do. There's also an intuitively designed combat system at work, involving special moves, combos, and so on. Another appropriate moment in combat is the addition of horseback riding. Characters can purchase various breeds of horses which in turn helps them get around a lot quicker and gives them leverage during combat (provided they advanced the right skill).Visually, Sacred boasts a pleasing mix of 2D landscapes and fully modeled 3D characters and creatures. Even though the backdrops appear slightly outdated, especially when you zoom in, there's a pleasing amount of nicely drawn out details, such as trees, flowerbeds, bushes, and so on. Water surfaces look cool as well, and there's a whole choice of impressive and colorful spells to see. The camera allows you to zoom in on the action at any given time... even then the models appeared to show a meticulous approach in design and animation.The game's audio is quite good. Gamers will be immersed the whole time thanks to a jumble of realistic ambient noises and a range of sweet tunes. The voiceovers are okay, but there's really not much to involve you there I'm afraid. Everything else seems to be in place.If you decide to purchase this game, you won't regret it. There are no breakthroughs in terms of general design involved, but the open-ended gameplay and an admirably lengthy single-player campaign is enough to the fancy of any gamer. If we disregard the relatively weak plotline, this is really an enjoyable RPG experience with enough content and replayability to keep you occupied for days. Plus, this is one of those rare games I feel the incentive to play again after I'm done with the review...Recommended ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know how to put it - Long time ago tens of game candidates competed who would be the next ""Diablo"" and Sacred was one of them. Dream never came true, but nevertheless Sacred wasn't a bad game - far from it. Its incredibly huge and open world with hundreds of sidequests, clear and wide character develeopment system and countless amount of armors and weapons to collect make it addictive and replayabe and these features still live strong after all these years !!

												Good or bad? Well... both. It depends what you're looking for, though.Sacred's an old game. Like reaaaaally old. This brings with it some issues, unfortunately. The game itself is good, but the problems may be off-putting, so let's cover the technical issues first as they can be a dealbreaker for many people given what they are.First off, Sacred is hard-coded to be 1024x768 resolution; this means that, under normal circumstances, it will fill a 4:3 square on a widescreen monitor with large black boarders on the sides. There are a few workarounds, but the largely involve forcing it to stretch out the horizontal which makes everything look remarkably fat. This also means that the resolution can't normally be increased, and it won't get prettier or fit more stuff on the screen.The second major issue is that multiplayer is not naturally supported by steam, steam does not give out CD-keys when you buy the game, and it's irrelevant anyway because the servers for the game are down regardless. Hamachi, Gameranger, and most other options will flat out not work. Evolve, found at evolvehq.com, is the only one known to be able to run it (though some have reported that Hamachi can run it by changing some setting, but I don't speak german so have no idea what they changed). Evolve, however, can link itself to your steam account which... is a little unsettling. I didn't want to play sacred with friends quite THAT badly, so for me, it's stuck being a single player game.With that out of the way, if you're still interested in the game despite the technical difficulties and problems with it being ancient, let me state that the game itself is actually quite good with nice gameplay elements.Yes, it's old, and no, it won't be better than Path of Exile (which is free), but it has a certain charm and feel to it that makes it quite enjoyable. If you pick it up for $5 or under, it's probably worth the cost.A few major things:- There are quite a few different classes in the game (races, acutally...) and each get their own unique set of spells and melee attacks. They each play fairly differently, and have enough customization that each playthrough can potentially feel quite different even if playing the same class.- Skills are a bit odd in that you don't get access to all skills; each class begins with two skills and get a number of new skills unlocked at levels 1, 3, 6, 12, 20, 30 and 50. Interestingly enough, you just get to PICK a new skill at these levels (starting at 3) but have more options than you can choose from, so you customize your character each time you play. This means you can have a melee mage or a fire mage or a mage that specializes in a wide range of elements or one that spams out a small number of choice spells more often, one which autoattacks, or one which utilizes combo attacks as their primary method of damage, or even one which tanks (well, alright, not so much a tank mage =P ). The point is, you get some pretty good customization so two players can both pick to be the seraphim and play her entirely differently and not step on each other's toes. Assuming you get the multiplayer to work from the earlier issue. *Cough*- Mounts exist in the game and you can ride a horse. In fact, you can even learn mounted combat, use your horse to charge over people, or teach it to run faster. It's kind of a neat system, but isn't really explored too much, yet moreso than probably any other game of the genre.- Combat's pretty fluid, enemies have easy to see radial healthbars around their feet which indicate their relative difficulty, level and remaining health clearly. You can highlight items on the ground as well, which is handy. It's especially fun to bounce around the battlefield unleashing multihit combos and seeing your character do more than just overhand swing 5x in a row, but instead actually use a variety of strikes from different angles, and some will even perform acrobatic attacks, backflips, and so on.- The storyline's not the best the world has ever seen, but it's certainly not awful, and by diablo-style dungeon crawlers, it's way above average. There's actual reasons for going through the various quests, the world opens up in a reasonable manner as you complete them, bosses tend to make you want to slap them good and hard before you even fight them... generally it does a pretty good job at what it sets out to do.- The spells in the game are pretty varied, and the characters do distinctly feel different from one another, even if they have a similar role. Sure, the vampiress and daemon are both female melee characters, yet the vampiress gets to change between a knight form and vampire form, preferring physical or magical abilities in nature, can summon wolves and bats to help her, drain health and so on. The daemoness, in contrast, gets things like the ability to fly over terrain, attach elemental properties to her weapons, fling fireballs and enact creepy japanese hentai tentacle porn scenes with dead bodies. No, I am not making that up, and my nightmares would prefer that I were. Alright, they're not nightmares. >.>;;- Individual classes have different item slots available to them. Most of them tend to share similar gear, though there are a few bits which are very specific to certain classes, such as say... the iconic seraphim's wings.- Money MEANS something. Zoh. Mah. Gerd. Know how in Diablo 2 and such, you'd get huge stockpiles of gold that were worthless? Or most any other diablo-style game? Yeah, turns out that you can actually buy uniques and set items off of vendors. In fact, if you get the skill for it (sacrificing a combat skill...) some classes can even actually increase the quality of stuff that merchants will sell (along with reducing the cost of such, and increasing the sale price of vendor trash, yay!), making it actually reasonable to build a set to some degree and not feel like your gold is worthless.- Big bosses. If you fight a dragon, you know bloody well you're fighting a dragon because it tends to not exactly fit on the screen. There's things like ""don't stand in the fire"" on bosses as well, stuff that needs to be dodged and so on. As in things that you didn't actually see until much later games for the most part. Sacred's not quite as great as a modern game, but compared to anything else from it's timeframe, it was quite a few years ahead of it's time in this regard.Overall, it's dated. Sacred has low graphics, major technological problems, and some real massive flaws to it... but compared to other games of it's time, I'd honestly recommend it and say it's quite a lot better than it had any real right of being. It's enjoyable for awhile, and worth a good $5 or so. As of the moment of this review, it's on for $2.49, and for the single player game, I'd say it's well worth the cost. It probably won't be a regretable purchase, as it's really not that bad and does a lot of good things that even many of the modern diabloesque games fail to live up to.If you ever want to go down a trip on nostalgia lane and play diablo 1 for some reason (I get that every few years myself =P ) I'd honestly recommend playing Sacred for your binge this time around. It's the better game of the two in large part, and has some really attractive features to it. It has some nuisances as well, but hey, it's old, give it a break. NO! NOT THE HIP! NOT THE HIP!

												Made in 2004, Sacred is one of the best Diablo-like RPS¬¥s out there. With an broad variety of weapons to loot, a giant open World to explore and a sense of humor, this game hols a special place in my heart as one of the first RPG¬¥s i¬¥ve ever played through. The lack of being able to change the resulution is the only downside. I purchased it on Steam because of ease of multiplayer and nostalgia...

The game is beautifully graphical designed, nice surroundings, different classes and races, intuitive way of character development. Should add to this  the large and diverse open world, unobtrusive long story, a lot of side quests, itemhunting. In my view the first part of Sacred is much better  the next parts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being from 2004 originally, the game certainly lacks some comfort more recent adversaries as Tochrlight 2 or Path Of Exile feature. At first, it also has a somewhat clunky feeling to the movement and attacking. This out of the way, this game is an excellent action-RPG. The world is beautiful, features a lot of atmospehere and nice, unique quests.The character-system is a bit different than in most aRPG's, as you basically collect runes to level up your skills, making it a tough decision after some time, as cooldowns raise with the level of the spell/attack. The 8 different characters all play completely unique and allowing for a huge amount of different builds.A special recommendation to german players, as this is the original language and the game absolutely shines. Brillant voice-acting of the characters (Willis' german voice etc.) and awesome dialogues.Still a solid 7/10, 7 because of obvious lacks in comparison to more recent games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sacred Gold reunites all the expansions into one single release. However, doesn‚Äôt fix the previous issues or adds any improvement.It‚Äôs still a great and huge RPG, where the player hacks and slashes across hundreds of enemies, with tremendous looting and exploration to do!Originally released back in 2004, Sacred is completely 2D, except for the main hero, which shows itself 3D. The world itself looks very 3 dimensional, with beautiful areas, worthy of today‚Äôs most prestigious indie projects. Either you traverse the vast green plains, the deep dark forests, or the southern desert, you‚Äôll be astonished by how beautiful Sacred looks.This enchantment easily gets you frustrated, as there are countless enemies across all the areas, in fact, there are just too many. For looting purposes, thus may sound like a dream come true, but ruins exploration as the player has to fight every single time!Ascaron tried their best with such huge project, however, they failed miserable by locking the resolution at 1024x768. Surely the standard back in the day, but today, it feels really bad.Thankfully, resolutions and frame rate can be improved by third party software like dgVoodoo2 that fixes and unlocks modern hardware usage.Sacred Gold is huge and for those who like to emerge themselves within a deep lore, full of quests and areas to explore, secrets to unveil and monsters to conquer, it‚Äôs highly recommended. Time consuming, but very addictive, makes this one worth it, even if you‚Äôre just looking to spend some time.Don‚Äôt take Sacred too seriously, as there are numerous humour situations that will make your day, especially if you visit the graves of those who fallen in battle.Multiplayer is still around, thanks to Tunngle, perfect to have some fun time with your friends. Just don‚Äôt worry if you get extremely addicted to Sacred campaign, it does tend to have such effect. :)A game that knows no time, and has no such thing as a limit. With so much different class, and difficulty levels, you could spend a small amount of your life enjoying and learning about the world of Ancaria. And you know what? Would be a time well spend!7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game with nice atmospheric gameplay. If you've enjoyed games like Diablo II, this one is good for you.The world is HUGE, tons of sidequests (plenty of stupid ones though).The main storyline is decent.Music is good.Graphics are kinda dated, the biggest problem is - you can't play on a larger resolution than 1024x768 (4:3).Can't remember applying any fixes on this game, runs well on Windows 7 Ultimate x647/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is by far the best oldschool Hack&Slash RPG of all time. In my honest opnion, gameplay wise, it beats the old diablo 1 and 2 by a long shot. The world is huge, the enemies are many, the leveling and difficulity setting is epic and the classes are way more defined.The story is... Just okay... But that is pretty much it. Do not even get me startet on the expantions storyline, because that is just wierd...Best thing about this game has to be the replay value. You never really get tired of playing it and it is super addictive. I have spend countless hours in this game, and it is a beastly fun game for LAN parties, if you can get it to work tho. It requires some research and guide reading to make it work properly and you should disable your firewall entirely. You also need to create a LAN server, and there is a file that lets you do that in the game folder. Oh, and you need to switch some internet/LAN setting in the options menu as well!Now for the bad stuff! Some people need to play this in windowed mode, and i would highly reccomend it for everyone, since the resolution is not realy fit for the big screen. It is also not a good idea to alt tab, since it tends to screw things up, and it has a tendence to crash once in a while, so save as often as possible.The worst thing about the game, is that internet play is not something you can do anymore. Damned shame!All in all, i would reccomend this game to all who likes a good Hack&Slash game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sacred is one of the most amazing and entertaining games I've ever played and definitely one of the most brilliant action RPGs ever made. Yes, it is quite old ( released in early 2004) and it doesn't look pretty anymore, and yes, the skill system can be quite confusing at the beginning - but it's absolutely worth it's money.What makes Sacred so special? + 8 different classes to choose from+ the skill/rune and combo system is very well thought through and flexible, which  allows a lot of experiments and strategies.+ a reeeeally big open world with tons of quests (over 300 even WITHOUT the Addon) + a high detailed atmospheric environment + a fantasy world with a lot of lore and background storys+ many eastereggs - and weird humor (grave stones)- full tanks are almost worthless while playing with a group in Multiplayer mode because no character can use taunts- old graphics- the story is okay, but it's quite simple and not very interesting. But let's not forget the online mode (which is probably the most entertaining part) that supports up to 16 players. The only problem is, that the official servers are down, you'll need a p2p VPN tool like Tunngle (works without problems and without laggs and is quite easy to install) or hamachi. It's art dammit, art!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awesome. I can't believe I hadn't played it before. ""Sacred"" has amazing graphics and roleplay, but it's plot is very ineteresting too. I enjoy playing this game a lot. I think it's one of the best games in this genre. I remember my first playing Diablo 2, when I was young, and this game is really similiar to Diablo, but anyway ""Sacred"" differs from it very much. Whatever, i think every rpg-fan should play this game once. Sorry everyone for my bad english, I tried my best writing this report.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been quite a fan of this game ever since it released in Spain, around 2004 or so. It's been 12 f#cking years, and somehow this game still stands somewhat high between other games of it's kind. But you know, all games have bad stuff on them, and that's where I will start the review, then move up to the best stuff you should know about it before making your purchase.First and foremost, the game hasn't aged that well. Granted, it could work way worse, but you should totally expect the game to crash a few times, get stuck and not let you use the task manager to shut it down and stay on a low resolution. Infact, it seems to have issues with the videos, so you might have to disable them to even play... And that means missing on some parts of the story as well. It should also be said that the game has no Steam Overlay support.Second, it has some weird difficulty spikes. The game ain't really too difficult (and if you go with Bronze difficulty you'll rarelly even die), but there are a few parts that seem weird, mainly dragons. You're fighting the damn thing and suddenly it uses a fire-breathing attack and your hp, no matter how tanky you are, will explode. And almost without warning! There aren't much more enemies that are difficult on the game besides them, however then come things that are too easy, the final boss being the biggest example. It's quite the anticlimax when he barely does damage and you whoop his‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•without effort. There's also enemies that deal poison as their main source of damage: poison is crap. Barely hurts, it's main effect seems to be slowing you down. That's quite dissapointing, however it also seems that using antidotes doesn't always even fix poison, which seems like a bug to me.Lastly, the graphics, while neat (specially for it's time), they have issues. The world is mainly a 2D gigantic landscape with semi-2D buildings and lots of 3D characters. The problem comes when buildings and the landscape get in between everything: buildings not letting you see enemies, hills hiding the way you're supposed to be going, objects that seem to be blocking a tight road but it's actually the way you should be going and it ain't blocked at all, it gets confusing a lot of times.Lastly, and mainly a minor problem, the English voices. They're a mix bag. The main characters actually do have a good voicecast, specially the Dwarf who's my favorite of them all. Then come enemies like goblins and orcs, which talk on their own language AS THEY SHOULD, instead of sh#ttified English, a really nice touch. Then, at the bottom of the barrel come enemies like the Sakkara Priests. The male ones sound okay but a bit forced, yelling each line at the top of their lungs, then come the female ones which SCREAM every line in the most stupidly hilarious accents possible and even keep screaming the most dumb death screams you'll hear in your life as they are decapitated with a damn hammer. I'd say 10% of the voices in the game are bad, only a 10%, but that 10% might even be a nice case of so bad it's actually good.That being said, what does the game do for itself? Have you played Diablo 1 or 2? It's similar, but in a MMO-sized world. Just think of World of Warcraft in 2D and singleplayer and you'll get the idea.The gameplay is enjoyable. There are 8 characters to choose (6 from the base game and 2 from the expansion included in the Steam edition) and they all feel quite different, with their own good and bad parts (although I've always felt the Dwarf was way more powerful and had a dumb negative part, not being able to ride horses). There's an insane amount of loot out there to get (and there are items which are only usable by certain characters) and each character has a good selection of skills you can use. It's fun, as you can just play whoever you feel like, and if you don't like it, just change your playstyle.The map itself should also get a mention as it's actually quite f#cking big for it's time and coming from a not-so-well-known developer team. There's plenty of different areas to explore, all of them with their own kind of enemies and obstacles, towns and different crap. And something that you don't see often is actually getting to visit the towns of the monsters you keep killing, which I like and it's a good touch. Specially since the Devs took the time to add places to the map that you don't have to visit through the storyline, but have quests and other good stuff on them, making you want to deviate from the main quests and just see what you can find.The game also offers a New Game+ option; you can export your character and then start a new game with it, which is great! It adds more difficulty and replayability to an already long game.The main characters are also fully voice acted and will usually give their own opinion to whatever is happening, which is fun, specially when they decide to break the forth wall and talk to you directly. The game also has a few references to other games and media, something I do enjoy a lot.Lastly, the game does have multiplayer... Although good luck finding anybody to play it with. After 12 years the servers are predictably dead and although you can play using third party software with some friends, it might be too much effort when you could just play something else instead.Do I recommend Sacred? If you like Roleplaying games with big open worlds, yes. Totally. It's a fun game that lasts, with the expansion pack included, around 16 to 20 hours, depending on how well you do. There's tons of stuff to discover and fun to be had, and in a sale it's probably a safe purchase... Just expect some technical problems to stay in the way at first. I will also say in advance that Sacred 2 is a decent follow up to this game (although more oriented to consoles than PC) and that Sacred 3 is a horrible follow up. You see, Sacred went the same way Dungeon Siege did: the first one is usually taken as the best, although it played it safe. The second one is a decent sequel with good aditions and other stuff that shouldn't be there. The third game however barely even looks like the rest and it's hated for it. If you ever look into this franchise, please stay with the first one, maybe just peek into the second one for curiosity. Ignore the third one, you'll be grateful.TL;DR Edition: Good open world RPG that's quite long but does have both technical difficulties and some difficulty issues. However it's quite enjoyable to people who can overlook it's age and how bad it works with a modern computer. On a sale, it's a safe purchase, although ignore it's sequels completely.

It is far from a perfect game and still contain it's fair share of bugs and issues but compared to Diablo this game has a lot more charm, the game is filled with easter eggs and secrets and with several very different characters to play each with their own voicelines they are not afraid to use.All in all this is a hack and slash rpg with a huge world filled with quests and characters with voicelines, play one of several different characters in the original campaign or the added underworld campaign.

												THIS GAME IS MY CHILDHOOD! T_TOn a serious note though...Sacred holds up so well! The open world works great, there are easter eggs, hidden treasures, unique behaviors and mysteries in every corner you are about to explore.The hack'n'slash aspect of Sacred is strong - it really is fast paced, combat is easily controlled and your character feels powerful.Speaking of which, character development has many of the sweet features - attribute points, skill points, high max level (216), magic, rare, set and unique items, collections, socketing, abilities, combos, miscellaneous statistics to grow.The catch is that Sacred is 10 years old, so there is no longer a formation that one would call a community for the game. Other than that, I cannot say anything bad about Sacred. Definitely recommending it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Must be honest, I started with Sacred and then went on Diablo and similar games. So, as people say that Sacred is the best clone of Diablo I would agree. Sacred doesn't have them dungeons and tunnels with limited open spaces everywhere; it's an open map, free to explore, a lot more to explore if one sticks only to the main quest, comparing to Diablo. So it's a different type of gaming experience. A lot of easter eggs in game (proporcional to the ammount of bugs, but the final version here in steam is quite good) which makes You wanna explore the map, find all the side quests.. Most quests are like ""kill this thing"", ""bring that thing"", but there also interesting ones and You have to look for them - that's the fun here. Progressing character is as fun as in Diablo.

												Sacred Gold is an old style action roleplaying game that has so much similarities with Diablo. Instead of skilltrees you have a fixed skillset that has to be leveled with glyphs. It is old school and I own the normal boxed set that was sold as it was published. It's still after all those years a great game. It's fun to play the difficulty is moderate and it has so much in common with diablo that the mechanics are learnt in a fly by manner. Still it has so much that set it appart that it's refreshing to play. I have to say, this one is even better than Diablo III (yes, I own this game, yes I hate it with an attitude). So even though this game is aged you still can play it and have lots of real fun, trying out the different classes, the different skill sets and so on. Playing through it will get harder and harder. But look it this way. If you like hack and slay, this game is for you. If you don't like hack and slay, you might try it to get infected with this insidious virus. Once you have started Ancaria will suck you inside, and you might never turn back to the Frosty-Storm 3.0 version of this genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sacred is actually one of my personal favorite top down RPGs. Sort of taking Diablo's gameplay to a different level. The graphics for it's time are quite good and the general gameplay was very enjoyable.The exploration in this game certainly pays off frequently as there are many thing that can help you on your quest that can only be found through thourough exploration.All in all there really isn't a whole lot I can really say other than this game is awesome :3Recommended for all fans of Diablo, Dungeon Siege or any other top down RPG.

												I was an avid player of Sacred Gold a long time ago but the lack of technology, schooling and my own copy of the game stopped my addicted gameplay. Now that I have my own copy I'm given intense flashbacks of playing and comparing characters with my family. Snarky/ sassy commentary, a variety of classes for players to choose from, female charcters, no MMO. I love it. It currently sits in the top 3 of my favorite games to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sacred Gold is immersive and fun to play.  Atmospheric sound effects and voice acting are good.  The graphics are sufficiently detailed not to look dated.  Quests are non-linear, but some quest hubs will require backtracking to grind the odd extra level or two.  There are a good variety of characters to choose from.  Some weapons and armour are class specific.  Certain weapons and armour can be crafted, enhanced or customized.  The skill tree is interesting and offers many specialization choices while forcing trade-off decisions.  The map is a lot larger than it appears to be at first glance, which should become evident some hours into the game.  Mobs and bosses have good AI and will sometimes flee when injured.  Often pursuing a fleeing imp draws you into line of sight of additional mobs.  Overall the game is enjoyable and can keep a player engrossed for many hours.  Challenge and difficulty scale moderately so that one's character never feels insanely over-powered or unfairly overwhelmed.  Sacred is one of the games that slipped under the radar because Diablo 2 was the de-facto standard in the genre.  This game is really good and it is a pity so many players never noticed it.

												Can't believe my luck for getting this game for just a couple of bucks.  Usually when a game is that cheap it's because it's only worth a couple bucks.  Just a few hours in, but this game is very fun if you like RPG's, that play and are similar to Diablo 2.  While it reminds me a lot of Diablo two for some reason I like this game better.  The gameplay is simple but addicting, quests so far are fun.  The 2D artwork is very well done as well.  Like I said I'm only a few hours in, but if the map is any indication the game world is pretty large.  Do all the quests, even the silly non heroic ones, you get combat arts as rewards for many of the quests.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It can get quite easy but big bosses are very tough. Despite being an older game meaning it doesnt have high resolution graphics and doesnt run on dirtect x9 or above.

												I had only been playing this game for a few hours when writing this review but I can already tell it is going to suck up many hours of my life. The style of game play is similar to Diablo 3 or Torchlight II, the sort of 2D/3D game world style of environment. The main quest chain seems interesting and entertaining, and I've come across a number of side quests, which are easy to obtain, and easy to complete. Not too easy that it is boring, and not too hard that it is difficult and annoying. If you are a fan of RPGs then this game is definitely worth your time to check out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Many an hour of my younger years was spent with my brother playing this game. I personally enjoy this game more than Diablo 2, though some may violently disagree. For $10 it's got 8 unique classes, two full campaigns and hundreds of hours of fun to be had building a character and many an amusing quest. What's more, I bet your PC can run it at max.

Sacred has a ton of quests, and divergent story lines for different classes, but it's not a very attractive game (in 2012), and the interface is really clumsy. the skills trees don't seem very well thought out.Newer ARPGs do everything that Sacred does, and do it better. I recommend Titan Quest or Torchlight, instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a click and move game so it can be hard on the wrist but as far as an RPG goes it still holds up to old school quality. Lots of loot, large map and cool skills and neat classes. Personally, I liked it better without the expansion because the new stuff they added made the game easier. It was rather difficuly when it first came out which made it much more likeable. Overall it is worth the money you pay if you like old school RPGs. The graphics are actually not bad for its age. Certainly a step up from Diablo 2 if you loved that game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes it's an Old Classic Hack N' Slash PC Style RPG Game with fully customizeable characters that like to back talk you if your AFK to long (funny mean lines they will say to you if your off more than 5 mins) and a really good story line about good vs evil, with Huge Bosses, and Mobs and Mobs of Minions in your way of them. Plus there is Tons of Quests and even Mounts to ride mainly Horses. Tons of Loot to collect and Gear to get.This is is yet another Diablo Style Hack N Slasher you will love. If you've played this one for along time you should know there are now 3 games out there for this now Sacred 2 Fallen Angel, and Sacred 3 which just now came out (and/or) Your are just now getting into it this game than this is where you want to start off at the beginning.

												The first time I played this game was 2006 (or something). It was given free with a games magazine in my country that I was buying. So every month I would put the game in my pc and try it. Mostly it was games I wasn't interested in but one particular month they gave away this game. So I put it in and the rest was history. Countless hours played, countless heroes made, including a level 80 gladiator and a level 70 mage, this game was my favorite game of all time and is still on top 10. And although you might not give a‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•about my favorite games of all times list you can't argue with the user reviews of this game. A game with a huge world with lots of different scenery including but not limited to: snowy mountains, forests, desert and even a volcano. Play with a variety of races and skills and get your chance to kill hords of different enemies. If you like hack n slash a-rpg you HAVE to try this. No other a-rpg has a fanasy world this beautifull (dispite the outdated graphics) with this much of it to explore. The dragon hunting in this game is real! 10 dragons for you to find, hunt and kill. No other game has made me so eager to go exploring. Just go and explore. See things, places, small villages in the mountains or big cities, rivers and even an aabandoned city in the desert.I was told it works in windows 7 so if you have windows 7 and you like hack n slash a rpg buy this game.WARNING: In windows 8/8.1 you can only play it in window mode it doesn't work in fullscreen and it's probably the same for windows 10 although I haven't tried.edit: Ok I tried it and it works! At first it started crashing but if you find config.exe in the game files and run it I have these settings: Fullscreen yesPlay movies yes32 bit color depth yesall the other no sound yesWith those settings mine works fineedit 2: But I have noticed some issues. I sometimes get framedrops, even to 30 fps and I have a very good system and game crashed when I tried to save (twice) not a very pleasant experience. I lost about 3 hours of gameplay.

												Normally I would have highly recommended this game. I have played it ever since the game came out. However, I would not recommend downloading this copy. After trying every trick in the book, I could not get the program to run past the load screen specifically at the spot that said 'fonts'. After verifying the program repeatedly, it would say there was a file missing and that it was being downloaded. Verified again, stated that the system was fine. Tried to run program and it still wouldn't run. According to Steam, there is no support for this game so essentially better luck next time. Until they fix these errors and make it playable on current systems, I would not recommend this. ((I have windows 10; 64 bit))			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game back when it was freshly released and instantly fell in love with it. Each class feels diffrent and size of map is enormous. Got it a few years back on steam and really had fun. Also it's possible to run on newer systems, although you need to do a few things to get it running and the main issue is hardcoded resolution, and that's why i recommend playing it in window mode, since steam overlay sometimes may bug the game. Other than that just get the game, especially when it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is by far one of my favorites of this genre and is trivial with the first two Diablos. You play in a free world - as in no loading sectors - and the map isn't a simple trail to follow. There are many side quests to do while working through the main story. Every NPC speaks and their stories for the quests are dynamic in that they say more than just the objective. There are many chests, barrels, boxes to open, every single building can be entered and explored, and nearly everything killed drops items with that chance of something super rare. The funnest part of the game is the randomness. There are many dragons out there and you never expect to find one when it happens. They tend to be hard to kill and are very rewarding when killed. The game is more addicting than Diablo 3 and Sacred 2, and deserves a better rating. I've been playing this game for two days straight and I haven't even made it through a quarter of the game. The graphics are very good because the style is well done. The architecture of all the buildings, trees, etc is amazing - props to the artists. I wouldn't just call this game a game, it is a work of art in design, story, and addictiveness. If I chose one game to die with this would be it. If I were to make one last wish before I died I'd wish for online multiplayer to come back and for more expansions for this game.  I don't care about the starving children in Africa, or global warming, or the unsustainable deforestation and water use, I want Sacred Gold to be reborn like the way Age of Empires II The Conquerors has been!

												For the enthusiast of the Classic RPG games! This is a well copied improvement of Diablo 2 with all the pros. The main quest is very entertaining and original, the map is big and quite vary, the secondary quests are not too much ripetitive but keeps up longevity and fun, the items and abilities are very many for each charachter. Also you can increase the difficulty level and play in multiplayer. Enjoy it, highly recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice, relaxing hack-n-slash, filled with easter eggs and more lore than an average RPG made nowadays. It's the little things like finding shields with one lord's coat of arms only on his lands, that really make it good. Admittedly it requires hours of grind, and suffers terribly from the fantasy female armour effect, but if you're looking for a way to kill time and get a laugh out of it, you won't regret getting this game.

												This game is great, some people may say the opposite or say that the game has great potential but that it's only ""good"", In my opinion, the game is real great, of course, there could be more but what made me really love this game is that there is 8 characters with different starting location and different quests.You can unlock difficulties by playing on the difficulty right before that difficulty.The graphics are awesome In my opinion.The game can be real easy though so if you're looking for a challenging isometric hack n slash action game then this may not be the game for you, the game is still really great to be played because of its World, story and characters.If you want a challenging one, you should try Path of Exile on the highest difficulty on hardcore, it is pretty good.If you like games such as Titan Quest, Dungeon Siege, Path of Exile, Divinity, Diablo, etc etc then you'll probably love this game.Personally, I think this game deserves 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun little RPG general hack and slash with sidequests thrown in, it by no means is the best RPG type gameout there, but its fun. Now it does have a lot of drawbacks, it has bad auto pathfinding, bad targetting in combat (instead of just clicking on a foe, you have to click and hold the mouse button to keep attacking..lame), you can't keybind without useing 3rd party program, you can't pause to aim, use abilities, etc, and many other features that really good rpg type games have, there is a headache of a loot system that makes you play around figuring out item properties 90% of the time and actually playing 10% of the time. But some fun stuff also.. you can ride horses! except that kinda eliminates a lot of fun abilities your character can do, which they can't do for some reason on horseback lol. Enemies respawn so you will constantly run into a horde of foes annoying you while trying to walk between towns, but hey it's a hack and slash game so i guess you can't hack and slash without foes.

												A very large 3d isometric action roleplaygame (arpg) simular to Diablo 2 or Torchlight. I've only been playing for 10 hours and have only discovered under 5% of the world so far just doing the main quest. Plenty of side quests to do on top of that. This is a good game though can be unforgiving at the begining. Play on an easier level for a while to level up and then import your character to start again on higher level.I have the disc version and bought this for convinience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The sheer amount of content alone and the general high quality feel of the game is enough to make this a must have for most RPG fans. People don't typically play action-RPGs for their riveting narratives. They want fast-paced combat, lots of environments and beasties, and tons of cool magic weapons, armor, and loot. Sacred's got all that in spades. A great-looking (for the time), generally solid action role-playing game that provides a few interesting gameplay innovations.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sacred: Gold  Field Rating Review   Graphics 4 Sacred hasn't aged very well, especially when you realize you can't run the game at full resolution on your monitor. There's a lot of optimizing issues the game has currently, so you'll run into random lag spikes that last a moment, particularly when running full screen. However, when it came out, the graphics were wonderful, and the animations very satisfying (the spell animations still are satisfying, just dated). So, with the age of this game in mind, I was a little more lenient.   Gameplay 9 Sacred is a classic hack-and-slash, and you will enjoy every darn minute of it. With a huge open world to explore, you can sink hours and hours into exploring every nook and cranny. While not being randomly generated, as several games in this genre now are, you will still find yourself exploring everywhere you can, time and time again. With 7 different classes to choose from, each with a unique playstyle, you won't get tired of booting this one up over and over.   Story 5 The story eeks by just enough to drive the game forward, but other than that, you won't find yourself caring that much. However, keep in mind this game has a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor, and treats its story as such. Thus, I give this on an even middle ground.   Multiplayer 7 Fantastic multiplayer, if you can get it to work. This would be a 10 if the darn thing worked well. Given the age of Sacred, it is a royal nightmare to get this one working correctly. But if you can manage to join a game together, you are in for one of the best times you've had gaming. (Due to the difficulty of joining multiplayer together, I have not included it in the overall score)   Replayability 8 With 7 classes, come 7 different playstyles, and a world large enough that you can just keep on going. I've owned this game since it came out, and I still find myself coming back to it over and over.I would come back even more if the multiplayer worked properly.   Overall 7.5/10 A long time favorite of mine, Sacred stands in a class of its own. I have plenty of fond memories playing this game with my Father and family over Christmas breaks. A lot of hack and slashers now and day are called Diablo-clones, but calling Sacred such a thing would do it a great injustice. With an expansive, sprawling world that puts Diablo to shame, and much more riveting gameplay, Sacred is not a game to be missed on any count. The multiplayer is outstanding and incredibly fun as you and your friends grow and battle in the world around you, saving it from the dark forces that are at play.

												I'm writing this as a negative review, not because the game is bad. It's your standard ARPG fare with a rather interesting levelling system, and go there, kill that, rinse, repeat style quests.The games works well in terms of gameplay, and the graphics were good at the time.The reason I'm writing this as a negative is that the game needs to be run in compatibility mode, and suffers from major graphical glitches, which make it incredibly hard to view and see.I've tried experimenting with the config file, running under various compatibilty modes and played with settings, which allow the game to run, but don't resolve the glitches. It's a great game and a pity that this issue can't be overcome. You're probably better off buying a newer ARPG that is still supported than this one, which I recommend only for its nostalgia factor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The next thing is that when I get in game, finally trying to enjoy this amazing world once more, my screen shatters all the time I'm trying to move.

It's not from the newest games, but it was godlike at it's time, at least for me. Diablo-like amazing huge world with many choseable classes each with unique spells and playstyle. Only thing is that there is no level scaling with you, so if you run into zone not eligible for your level there is a huge chance you are gonna get one shot by a random dude with  levels higher, so I wouldn't risk that, just go and enjoy the world as it is.
