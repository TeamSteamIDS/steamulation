												Resurrection of Evil is the official expansion pack for Doom 3, being also developed by Nerve Software and released in 2005, just a year after original. It's a pretty standard good expansion pack, adding new levels, new monsters, new weapons and adds a bit to multiplayer.It also had Xbox version, where it was standalone, had flashlight on pistol and also included classic Doom games.Technical problems are same as Doom 3. If you set up config file for Doom 3, then you will not have to change anything for this addon.Just repeating. To fix game always setting low texture quality and to add widescreen support you have to edit config file manually. As said, I recommend visiting PCGamingWiki site as it has a good example for autoexec file.And yea, I still had same technical smaller problems. Bodies not disintegrating properly. Lighting/shadows breaking slightly after getting to the next level. Stuttering and lag on modern hardware.As for multiplayer, it still looks quite dead. I write this one single phrase too much, playing old games and all. Anyway, expansion pack also would increase player limit to 8 and add Capture The Flag gamemode. Oh, and Double Shotgun, yep.Didn't get to play any match yet so still can't comment on fun or quality.The plot of this game follows that UAC didn't give up on Mars, not to mentioning that they recieved some strange signal from the dig side 1. The research is actually ran by female character about who you could learn in original Doom 3 through PDA devices, as the one to ask for UAC investigation on Dr.Betruger. Your team's job now is to investigate what is going on there, so sure thing you blow a wall up, grab artifact and let the hell break loose once again.And now you have to go and kill the main villian, closing the main cliffhanger for Doom 4 from the Doom 3 ending, dooming us all to wait another 10 years until new Doom game. Good job.And so begins yet another 10 or so level long adventure, coming from caverns and back to the base. This time around it feels less polished on survival horror side. Or at least it has less emphasis on this. Areas felt less greatly done in shadow/lighting, there wasn't as much of darkness. There wasn't as much of atmosphere either. Like, ambience in sounds is even more forgettable. In all honesty, I doubt that putting player into same experience as in Doom 3 would have worked, seeing how long that game lasted in the bases. And it has some interesting scenes, like zombies walking through X-Ray or very occasional spook. Still, it's still doesn't feel as special.Yea, means no new music.But hey, at least now it's more actiony, it doesn't take long to get into parts where you will fight few monsters that aren't just dumb melee zombies.Not to mentioning that I like the way story was given here a bit better. It doesn't spam with as much of useless audio logs. And PDA shows email and logs that actually seemed to be written during the invasion, making it feel more immersive and interesting to me.And just look at all those new weapons that the developers added. It's like they listened to what was cool in 2005 and putted it in.- Double Shotgun, check. Because it was cool since Doom 2. Just like Super Shotgun in Doom 2 it's more powerful than it got to be. I mean, seeing how it can easily one-hit most of enemies and Doom 3 is all about just facing very few enemies it's a bit too much. Still awesome gun. Still menly. Well, fine, at least Expansion isn't afraid to throw more than one enemy at you in same time.- Gravigun, check. Because Half-Life 2 made it cool. Apparently it has some long name and mainly called Grabber. Now, I was laughing at it since Doom 3 had one of the worse implented physics at that time. Enough to be there, not good enough to be actively used. And sure thing, throwing boxes and barrels was wacky at best. But actually, as it immeditly shows you in cutscene, it's made it so you could grab enemy's fireball and throw it back, which is why you have only limited time to hold object. And for fireballs it works excellent, not to mentioning that monsters often die from a single hit, so it's actually cool gun.- Some cool-looking heart artifact that also slows time down, check. Because Max Payne made slow-mo cool. Actually it becomes more powerful as you progress, adding increased damage and invincibility, as if it wasn't enough. While it may feel annoying that when you activate it monsters spawn into room way too long and you often have to kill them all before doors are unlocked, there are so many corpses in the game with which you feed this thing that I felt that I could as well use it in almost every fight.Yea, I felt that I was given too much firepower in this one.It also brings out new monsters, but nothing that can bring enemy side on same level as you. The only two worth noting were much more stylish-lookings variety of imps and this new juggernaut of sorts that is like Mancubus but shoots more often. Eh, actually there isn't much new.At least it got boss fights! And they are pretty good, even if you can just use your heart artifact on them. Actually, I think that they require you to use all these new powers you got, so enjoy, they aren't too weak. Worth noting is awesome final boss who doesn't suck this time around. Because in Doom 3 the final fight was weak and gimmicky once you realized what to do. Good conclusion.Expansion Pack gives player of Doom 3 more of gameplay hours. It tries to amuse them by focusing on less darkness and by adding new cool toys to use. But it doesn't feel as polished by me and less special. Still cool.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you've played Doom 3, this is more of the same. Not necessarily a bad thing, considering that Doom 3 is a fine game with loads of secrets and engaging combat. The grabber is a nice edition, although I never really liked using it and you can more or less beat the game without it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just beat DOOM 3 Resurrection of Evil- getting ready for the new DOOM game coming out. Its a good game, its a nice addition to the DOOM 3 game. I enjoyed playing through this game and thought it was a lot of fun. People say that this expansion was the ""toned"" down version of DOOM 3 with less scary parts in it and less things that pop-out at you, but I thought RoE was just as scary at times. Overall a good game. The grabber (Gravity gun) was awesome to use when playing through this. The grabber is comparable to the gravity gun in Half-life 2-both are awesome guns. I recommend playing through this expansion after beating DOOM 3. 8.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is almost as fun as the original Doom 3. The demonic superpowers given to your character in the game did not really make the game any better. In fact, I would argue it made the game worse. The problem with the demonic superpowers is it changed the dynamics of the gameplay. They made the game enemies more numerous and tougher because of the superpowers which normally wouldn't be a problem, but you have no idea when exactly you will need it and you have a very limited number of times you can use it so you have to use it wisley. Some waves of enemies require the superpowers and other waves are so short or easy that usng the superpowers would be a waste of it's limited uses. There is no way to tell which waves of enemies you encounter will be hard and which will be easy making it essentially a guessing game of when and where you should and shouldn't use it.But even with it's flaws, the Doom 3 francise is a classic and always will be. If you are looking for and oldschool survival horror FPS game to play,  you will not be dissapointed wtih this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DOOM 3 Resurrection of Evil is a short expansion campaign that lasts 3-4 hours long returning you back to the familiar sites from the original game. There are a couple of new enemies, new weapons (grabber aka gravity gun & double barrel shotgun), and new powerups that make this expansion worthwhile. The levels and enemies are more difficult in this expansion and the use of the new weapons help keep the gameplay fresh and not too repetitive. The expansion does a good job closing up the story from the original game while putting players through a challenging campaign with some new tools at your disposal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still suffering the same problems doom3 had: No diversity in the levels, they are all clausterphobic, linear, and look quite similar. The game isnt even scary, so it just feels like a mediocre shooter with linear levels. Its still a decent game though, worth a playthrough if you enjoy doom games at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a biased Quake fan, I found this add-on deliciously entertaining.  ID titles historically have had added fun in their add-ons and D:RoE continues this tradition.  ID fans are after hot and heavy action and blowing up otherworldly foes, which this title has plenty of.  While the graphics are obviously outdated at the time of this review, the gameplay still holds up as entertaining.  Its nice to get nostalgic with this game and not having to pull up DOSbox and my old CD-ROMs to do so.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am partial as I liked the original game very much. Half Life 2 came out around the same time and I liked it better, however, Doom 3 offered a unique gaming experience. I liked how the protagonist is going deeper down into the territory of chaos. Not to mention the game was very dark and oftentimes quite scary. And the parts in hell were done superbly. Overall, I was not disappointed. Not one bit.Resurrection of Evil was inevitable. I mean, if you played Doom 3 you could draw the conclusion after watching the last cutscene that id has some unfinished business.RoE changed the gameplay a little. We all remember the so-called Cube artifact from the original game; now, RoE offers some new artifacts. For example, the Grabber is a gun similar to Gravity Gun in HL 2; what makes it more interesting is that not only the objects can be grabbed by it but also the demons' projectiles. The weapon comes quite handy when an imp throws its fireballs at you.You battle the so-called hunters; these are boss battles and after defeating each demon you acquire an ability (such as slowing down time around you). If I remember correctly these required some charging before using.One of our favourite weapons from Doom 2 returned: the double-barreled shotgun. Twice the barrel, twice the stopping power! I liked how the developers explain how such a weapon could find its way on to Mars (think about the story of the chainsaws). Resurrection of Evil does its job as an expansion. It offers new types of enemies, new weapons, new plot elements and you'll finish it in a mere 5 or 6 hours. Nothing special, but nothing bad either. At least this game got a decent expansion unlike HL 2's atrociously short Episode 1!You can pick it up if it's on sale or go with Doom 3 BFG Edition which includes this one as well as the original.

												Short and sweet.  If you're looking for an extension (with a couple of cool little additions) to your Doom 3 game, this is a great purchase!  If you're looking for a mind-blowing new experience, you may be disappointed.I personally found it worthwhile as it's a decent number of new levels with a new story to go along with them.

												Expansions are hard to come by these days. They're not as popular or profitable than many modern post launch support practices but roughly ten years ago as I write this they were the bread and butter for expanding a current game while working on a sequal or seperate project. Doom 3 Resurrection of Evil features a new campaign which I will be discussing in this review.Now what did Doom 3 RoE bring to the table? Some minor new ememies to fight and two new weapons, the Grabber which is basically the Gravity Gun from Half Life 2 and the Double Barrel Shotgun AKA the Boomstick! This will be your new friend as shotgun ammo is now more plentiful, the gun is hugely powerful and enemies can often die in one or two hits with it. Honestly at times it makes all the other weapons rather useless minor a few moments here and there. I'm also a sucker for the Double Barrel Shotgun in video games, I can't help but enjoy using them. Now the story here is nothing special like the last one, after the events of the first game a new excavation team go back to Mars and explore the ruins and you activate some artifact that actually helps you in the game. It stops time at the start but you can get upgrades for it later on.Nothing much can't be said other than some very minor tweaks. There are less enemies that unfairly leap and spawn right behind you. I forgot to mention in my review for Doom 3 that enemies would often spawn right behind you but I can only count two cases where that happens here. I felt that the game got oddly harder later on in the campaign. Not a huge difficulty spike but enough to notice that the difficulty curve skipped a beat. I think I enjoyed this a little more. The two new weapons were fun to use and the Artifact could really help you get out of some jams. If you're gonna get Doom 3 then odds are you're going to buy Resurrection of Evil in a bundle of some form so there is no harm in trying it out. I give it 6.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a fan of the Doom series, especially since I originally played Doom as a shareware game when it first came out.  Doom 3 was good, but not great.  The same goes for this expansion.  It's good, there is a whole new mission, not just a few levels, a new gun, some new creatures to kill, but really nothing more.  This is more of an add-on to the original game rather than a full blown expansion.  Luckily, I purchased the expansion for very cheap, and therefore I was able to enjoy the game.  It seems that not much has changed here.  It's still corridor fights, and dark environments.  The biggest addition is the grabber gun.  Almost on par with the portal gun, however, the visual that you obtain when using the grabber gun is very confusing and does not create a smooth flow of gameplay.Not a necessary play, but I recommend it because.........well it's fun to kill Demons.

												While it retains most of the elements that made Doom 3 great, like the scary space horror atmosphere and hellspawn enemies, its campaign is a lot shorter, we are talking about an expansion after all.On the other hand the new weapons added were great, especially the double-barreled shotgun (or super shotgun as it is called) from Doom II became my favorite from the traditional weapons, the feeling of getting very close to an enemy and then blasting him with two simultaneous shotgun shells was immeasurable. The Grabber Gun (obviously inspired from Half Life 2's Gravity Gun) and Heart of Hell artifact were nice additions as well.Another advantage was that the final boss fight was harder than the very easy one in Doom 3 (which felt as a joke compared to the rest of the game) and finally tied up the loose ends left in the latter.

												Doom 3 is one of my Favorite FPS games, Doom in general is my favorite FPS, with Valve's own Half-Life following. I highly reccomend this game to fans of Dead Space, F.E.A.R, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Call of Dumb, and Half-life. Doom was a bright, colorful Run & Gun, Doom 3 was a slightly generic, Dark but Colorful game. I can't really say That the tech is dated, because of the fact that it looks great as is, and can look ""real-er"" with Wulfen's 1024x1024 textures, Sikkmod/ Dafama's shaders and sound more scary with Trent Reznor's sounds.Pros:-Engaging story-BEAUTIFUL graphics-Easily moddable-Immersive details and textures-JUMPSCARES!!!-Interactive screens-Puzzles-Awesome Techno/Ambient soundtrack and great theme songCons:-No widescreen support-Antialiasing can't go higher than 4x-JUMPSCARES!!!-Cutscenes end with the camera entering Doomguy's head-Models anen't very circular, look at Half-life 2			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												MUCH better than the main game. It plays less like a horror game and more like good ol' Doom! The Artifact, which briefly buffs your character, helps balance the difficulty and allows for a more offensive oriented playstyle. Outnumbered? Low on health? You wanna just blindly charge into the enemy horde? The Artifact's got ya covered!Aside from the artifact, the whole expansion pack was clearly designed with fun first in mind. It's just more fun to play than the main Doom 3. There are fewer corridors, more enemies to fight, the boss fights are more intense and you even get the classic Super Shotgun!If you played Doom 3, but didn't like it then give this expansion pack a chance! You will be pleasently surprised!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
