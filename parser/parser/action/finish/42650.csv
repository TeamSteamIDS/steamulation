												This is one of the most gratifying things about being an older gamer: when fans of popular franchises grow up and get jobs in the video game industry. A lot of uncharitable things can be said for media culture's habit of remaking, rebooting and rehashing old stories, but when it's done from the heart like Transformers: War for Cybertron plainly is, the result is very often a damn good time. See Joss Whedon's ""Avengers"" or Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" movies: both are exuberant love letters to their source material and it shows.If you have fond memories of the 1980s iteration of The Transformers[www.imdb.com] cartoon up to and including the 1986 movie[www.imdb.com], High Moon Studios' first TF outing is a high-octane shot of finely-tuned nostalgia. From the minute you start up one of the game's two single-player campaigns (one for the Decepticons, and one for the Autobots - just for story's sake, I recommend you play them in that order, although the game gives you the option to choose), you will feel like a kid again, plopped in front of the TV after school watching the Autobots smash the bolts out of some Decepticreeps. Peter Cullen voices Optimus for the umpteenth time and hits it out of the park of course, and while he is, I believe, the only voice actor present from the original series, the rest of the talent is excellent and written in exactly the same style as the old cartoons. So you get the familiar banter of Megatron/Starscream, Megatron/Soundwave (the original bromance), Soundwave/everyone, Starscream/Skywarp/Thundercracker, Optimus/Ironhide, Bumblebee/everyone, but also some not-so-familiar characters like Air Raid & Warpath, both of which are hilariously scripted and voiced and really feel like they could be right out of the show. The story is a straight prequel of the cartoon: Cybertron is a war-torn mechanical planet, the Decepticons want to grab all the power they can, the Autobots kinda don't want them to, someone gets a little too Dr. Strangelove on things and oops, we have to leave the planet because we broke it. You're not gonna get Spec Ops: The Line or Bioshock Infinite out of this -- it's robots beating the crap out of each other, innit? But it is a pitch-perfect story with a delicious topping of fanboyism and if you're the target audience even a tiny bit, you'll love it.So what about the game itself? Well... I hesitate to say too much because my inner kid loves the theme-park-ness to pieces, but it is unfortunately a rather average third-person shooter. That's not to say it's badly done, it's not. Technically it's spot-on, it looks good and plays well, but does it do anything new? Not really. It should have a cover system, it doesn't. You can transform into whatever vehicle your chosen robot is, which is awesome, but it doesn't really matter other than stretches of levels where it's either transform or run a lot (and you run slow, but okay, you weigh ten tons). The controls for vehicle mode are kind of frustrating (game devs: no one enjoys driving with a mouse. It was new and weird in Borderlands, it's old and annoying now. It really is. Stop doing it) and it's disappointing that you don't get a greater sense of speed when you're in ""boost mode"". The guns sound great, but they could have more variety. The world certainly looks like Cybertron, which again: awesome, however all the metal-on-metal-with-the-occasional-sky motif can be a little boring. But Cybertron is basically Coruscant with less trees, so I'm not sure what else they were supposed to do. There's not a lot in the way of exploration, either for collectibles (there are some, but they very much feel like an afterthought) or just because, and it can't be called anything but a very linear experience. But that's more or less okay since it really tries to be an extended episode of the cartoon, and in that, it succeeds. Hugely. But... all of that does sadly mean that in my opinion if you have little to no desire in watching a bunch of robots shoot each other while making snarky comments, you will probably not miss much by giving this game a pass. There are much better shooters if that's what you want.But if you are a Transformers fan at all, grab this. Grab it grab it grab it. It's fantastic, and I can't wait to play Fall of Cybertron.(Quick note on multiplayer (and a quick note is all it is since I have no experience with it): it's supposed to be good. Fall of Cybertron is supposed to be even better. That's it! There are plenty of other reviews for the multiplayer side and the consensus is, again, ""good"". ""Fun"", even. I don't know what else to tell you.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be honest, I have actually written a pretty long review-ey type thing talking about the many things this game did right and whatnot but halfway along the way, it didn't seem persuasive enough to recommend people to play the game.So instead, I'm just gonna list 30 awesome things/moments I can think of off the top of my head as to why you should get this game and play the heck out of it:1. It has Transformers2. It is amazing3. It uses a lot of G1 influences meaning all the characters are their loveable and awesome selves, just as you remember them as a kid4. The robots have all been redesigned with a modern look but still manages to capture the essence of the cartoons5. Peter Cullen6. The gameplay is awesome7. The transformations are seemless8. The shooting is incredibly satisfying9. The voice acting is god damn great10. Megatron is so gar, you can't help but follow him11. Optimus Prime is as gar as Megatron12. The world building and the atmosphere in this game is so effective that you do actually feel like you're in a war in a dying planet filled with robots13. You fight a boss so big and so powerful that you have to enter himself, disable him from the inside, escape his inside before he crushes you as he transforms, plummet from space to the planet below WHILE fighting the boss and then watch him crash land like a comet into the ground...14. AND THEN fight him again cuz he's such a badass and that crash land was apparently just a 't'is but a scratch' situation before you can finally take down this behemoth15. Incredible boss fights not limited to the one above16. Scenery Porn (especially if you like metal-themed environments)17. Memorable Characters18. Bumblebee is voiced by Lelouch vi Brittania19. Multiplayer Co-op20. Catchphrases, One-liners, War Banters and Transformer Jargon are all music to your ears as you play21. Did I mention the voice acting is great?22. The voice acting is friggin' great23. You can fly24. You can drive25. You can shoot stuff26. You can shoot stuff while flying27. You can shoot stuff while driving28. You can shoot stuff while flying, transform to a robot and proceed to shoot more stuff, transform into a jet and zoom past the baddies and into a sniping point, turn around, shoot stuff, transform and shoot stuff with your sniping weapon :D29. You can shoot stuff while driving, ram into the enemies, shoot stuff while reversing, transform and shoot them in the face, run up to them and melee them in the face, transform and drive away :D30. This game made me realise how incredibly bad the Bayformers were.			",96,15,2,12,5,0,3

												If you are a true Transformers fan, then you will love the game. A  neat feature about the game is that there are 10 chapters; the chapters are LONG. The first 5 chapters you will play as the Decepticons and the last 5 chapters, you will play as the Autobots.A cool thing about War for Cybertron is when you select a chapter, you can decide if you want to be Megatron, Barricade, Star Scream or even Sound Wave and a few others. My all time favorite Decepticon to play, would be Megatron. Megtron's main weapon is a huge cannon, which knocks an autobot down in one hit! Star Scream is also really sweet to play, he is quick and has a deadly weapon.On the Autobot side, you can play as Optimus Prime! (like we didn't know already lol). He is really cool. His main weapon is a awesome assault weapon. A few characters you can play on the Autobot side, are Optimus, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jetfire and a few more. Probably my two favorite are Optimus and Ironhide.The campaign is pretty good. I read the book, ""War for Cybertron"" a year before I played the actual game. I enjoyed the game because it explained things better than the book. There were only a few things I didn't like; one was when you played as the Decepticons, the Autobots sometimes acted like bad guys when they shouldn't. For exmaple - autobot ""I am going to destroy you!!"". That seems like something Megatron would say. lol.The graphics are pretty decent. The only downfall to the game, which is biggest issue for me, is that it's capped at 30fps so you won't be able to go past that (unless you download programs which I don't recommend). Since it's capped, it's best to keep the settings on low so it will run smoothly. There are times that my PC stuttered because of the 30 cap and it's not because my PC isn't good. My PC can run alll CoD games on High-Extra.Other than the 30 cap, my next issue is that the last chapter was a little ""lame"" as for it was similar to the Autobot's campaign. I won't reveal any more info than this as I don't want to ruin it others. :\As a side note, when I first launched it on Windows 8.1, it wouldn't load. If you expenience this issue, move the Physx file to desktop and  launch the game, (it will give an error, after that,  put the Physx file back where you found it), then launch it again and it should run.Overall, good story, fun Decepticons/Autobots characters, decent graphics, = Worth it!

												Transformers: War for Cybertron is a good Transformers game. Wrap your brain around that. High Moon Studios clearly cares about the franchise, and went to some lengths to include a large number of popular Transformers, as well as lesser known ones. This game is not related to the Michael Bay movies. Even if the action is a little repetitive, it's a bold move to make a three-player coop, no cover system, third person shooter nowadays. The voice acting is fantastic, and the last couple missions are really awesome. If you like Tranformers, It's a solid A. For everyone else, it's a decent action game.			",772,173,11,91,53,5,124

Transformers: War for Cybertron is a 3rd Person Action Shooter. The Cybertronian Civil War takes a turn when Megatron and his Decepticons get hold of an ancient power source, just as a new Autobot leader emerges to face him.Pros: The story, although linear, is solid with great voice acting and writing, as you walk the grounds of Cybertron facilities, prisons and cities in a 10-chapter campaign that has you battling in squads of iconic characters from the series (pretty fun in co-op, too!). Each chapter will have you choose from three characters with different class, weapons and vehicle form, a selection that varies with each chapter. Transforming is an essential part of combat, as robot form allows you to jump, do special moves and carry up to two weapons, while vehicle mode allows faster movement and strafing as well as alternative weapon & ammo reserve. Graphics are pretty good, textures being higher resolution in-game than in cut scenes, while sound effects feel genuine to Transformers.Cons: Besides being able to transform, combat is nothing special, as there is no cover system beyond moving your character behind an obstacle, and weapons go from generic machine gun to generic shotgun, generic missile launcher, generic sniper, and anything in between. You might think melee combat would be an alternative, but in fact it feels worst as each melee strike takes a few seconds to complete, meaning you'll avoid using it at all in tougher fights unless the enemy AI happens to come within range. The characters, enemies, obstacles and backgrounds all have the same aesthetic and look, making it hard to know what's what in the heat of a firefight. As for the campaign length, well, let's just say they could've been longer seeing the only replay value lies with what's left of the multiplayer community.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!This isn't the Batman: Arkham Asylum of Transformers, but it's no doubt the best we'll get. Hasbro has certified it as an official canon prequel to the Transformers, so it's pretty awesome for a fan to see how Starscream came to join the Decepticons, how Optimus became a Prime, and what events took place in the times before the Autobots left Cybertron. While non-fans may find this game to be a plain 3rd Person Shooter, I still strongly recommend it!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												It's not only one of the best Transformers games out there, it's also one hell of an action game, with a unique theme, varied gameplay and lots of cool mechanics not present in other third person shooters. Though the story and execution are not as epic as the sequel - Fall of Cybertron - the overall gameplay is still thoroughly enjoyable and well paced. WfC also offers a bit better vehicle sections than FoC, and way better and more challenging boss fights. Not to mention, being able to select one of three characters available for a specific chapter is definitely a plus.People familiar with the Transformers will immediatelly appreciate the amazing animations and the artstyle faithful to Generation One, but the overall graphics are impressive on their own. One drawback I can think of in that regard is that it can be too dark/brown at times, with enemies being hard to distinguish from the rest of the environment. As for the audio, let's just say it's almost flawless, featuring some great music tracks, quite powerful sound effects, and an amazing voiceover, with numerous actors reprising their roles as familiar robots from the original show.Still, even though the PC port is very much playable, it's quite lacking in many respects. From unrebindable controls, 30fps lock, minimal graphics options, to a complete lack of DLC, and multiplayer being full of cheaters. That aside though, it's still an awesome shooter, worth playing despite these drawbacks for the story campaign alone.			",577,175,14,88,51,8,118

												Transformers: War for Cybertron is an exciting game which allows you to experience the time before the films as one of three Decepticons or Autobots. You take part as an important member of Decepticons or Autobots and have to destroy a lot of Transformers shooting at them or hitting them with your melee weapon.Thankfully, War for Cybertron impresses with an excellent single-player campaign with full co-op support, the included Horde-alike Escalation mode, and surprisingly deep and inventive online multiplayer component.After years of uninspired movie-licensed games, we finally get to run, fly and drive around with the Transformers and be happy about it. The lacking AI and unvaried fighting sections kill some of the fun, but the game does have a lot of redeeming factors and with a second player you'll feel right at home.A little bit more polish could have made this game a blockbuster title.

												A few reasons to consider whether or not to get this:1.) Any fan of the original will go nuts for the Nostalgia alone; worth full price. - Totally awesome and original story with great voice acting.  2.) The combat is beyond insane.- Runs FAST and flawless while looking gorgeous on ancient hardware (35 fps 1080p 2xAA Core2Duo 2.5GHz. NV:240GTS)and Number 3:A perfect 'excuse' / 'valid reason' to get that Garage Door size HD projector and Dolby Digital 7.1 Surround Sound setup you always wanted deep down in your heart. ;D~A review before me summed it up perfectly: ""IT'S AWESOME!!!!""

												Transformers: War for Cybertron is a non-stop TPS action from start to finish.The game tells the story of the civil war between the Autobots and Decepticions, which will eventually lead to the Autobot exile in the Fall of Cybertron sequel. The campaign is split into 2 segments: 5 Decepticion missions and 5 Autobot missions.Between each stage you have the option to choose 1 of the 3 character classes: Soldier, Scientist and Scout, each with its' strengths and weaknesses.The story features quite a lot of the iconic robots from the Transformers universe: Megatron, Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Starscream, Omega Supreme, Trypticon.... just to name a few, but the line-up is quite large.The game is well optimized, it runs smooth on max settings, however the FPS is limited to 30, which might turn some people off.Overall War for Cybertron is a great TPS action game, which is highly recommended if you like Transformers or just great TPS games in general! PROS:- Good looking visuals.- Solid, responsive controls.- Good atmosphere.- Non-stop action.- Decent story.- Solid PC port: looks good and runs well, though the FPS is capped at 30.CONS:- 30 FPS limit.

												This game was fun to play, but also a little bit boring.I think this was made more for the hardcore Transformers fans, since I didn't really enjoy wandering around a city where everything was made of metal everywhere, no matter where I looked there was metal and mechanics (but what would you expect from Cybertron). There is not much else they could have done, but I simply like the Transformers better if they are on the Earth a lot more.It was cool to play Co-op, but you cannot communicate at all, neither kick. Often people joined and couldn't play at all, they kept dying which meant we had to start over again from the last checkpoint. And some of them just didn't want to learn how to avoid attacks from a boss so I ended up playing it entirely singleplayer sometimes.It doesn't feel that natural to drive around in their vehicle form, but on the other side it was a little bit fun.You have a lot of action in this game and an interesting story. I liked the Autobots story a lot more.After completing the Autobots story it made me feel proud of myself.All in all I would have to recommend this game, but only if you are familiar with Transformers and a little bit interested.

												Only played the single player campaign. Third person shooter. 5 missions for each side, Autobot and Decepticon.You run around shooting stuff and picking up new weapons along the way. Your characters don't improve/gain xp.Each mission gives you 3 characters to choose from. Usually they're all different classes, ie - leader, soldier, scout, scientist. Each class has different powers and starting weapons.The story takes place on Cybertron. The Decepticon campaign tells the story of how Megatron basically broke Cyberton. The Autobot campaign tells the story of how the Autobots had to deal with Megatron's actions.Controls are simple enough. Move, jump, double jump, aim/look, fire, secondary fire/zoom, switch weapons, reload, melee attack, use object/pick up weapon, throw grenade, skill action 1, skill action 2, and transform. Transforming will turn your character into a cybertronian car or jet. With either, you can execute a boost movement, this basically takes the place of running in robot mode. There is no run key for robot mode. As a car you can also jump. As a jet you can fly. This is a enormous tactical advantage. Another key differenc between car and jet is ammunition. Cars have cannons with limited ammo while jets have guns and missiles, both of which are unlimited. They're unlimited but you still have to ""reload.""Every enemy you defeat drops energy. It's not health, it's energy to power your special skills.It's pretty short but fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR: A wonderful game that gives Transformers justice. Very chaotic and immersive coupled with a compelling story. It's flaws are present, but not game breaking. Hail Megatron!A grand justification to the  brand. Transformers: War for Cybertron redifines the bots we know and love without straying too far from the G1 look and feel. This game is action packed from start to finish. Explosions and debris a plenty. The graphics and gameplay are astonishing. From the opening cutscene you see Cybertron unfold like never before. High Moon Studios developed a game with a high degree for attention to detail, from fluid tranformations (that never get old) to moving to making the planet feel alive. When there was a full scale battle the player can feel like there are actual bots fighting on the allied side and the opposing side. One thing I didn't like was the scaling of the bot models. There should be a very noticeable size difference between someone like Megatron and Starscream.The game mechanics are nice, but flawed. Shooting and switching weapons is very snappy and responsive on the gamepad and mouse. The melee system leaves too much to be desired. The animation can vary from being too delayed to being too prolonged. The ammo system can be very frustrating. Ammo is more scarce then I would have liked, but the reloading is fluid. I would have done away with the whole system completely. A cooldown method would have been more effective and immersive. Or maybe nothing of the sort at all. I also would have liked if the guns were for sci-fi like. The various weapons were too human-esque for my liking. A Bay approach to the weapons would have been worlds better.Overall, I enjoyed this game immensely and I am eager to play the second.			",68,7,3,6,20,0,9

												Not a typical transformers game...This game takes part 10.000 years before Transformers first apear on the Planet Earth. This game is mainly about Autobots...they want to escape from Cybertron, and run away from Desepticons, and during all they game they fight against them to survive.This part is even better then the next one, ""Fall of Cybertron"". Fall of Cybetron, I think, is just a small ending, it's shorter and the story is a but stupid.Graphics are pretty good, big variety of Transformers for choosing + you can play co-op or multiplayer mod.My mark: 8			",140,26,5,13,9,2,30

Short version: 83%War for Cybertron tries to be faithful to the core of the TransFormers mythos, but it also manages to tell its own story with a good amount of writing; especially considering that the game itself is just a typical squad-based third-person shooter of above average quality.Long version:The developers at High Noon obviously were no strangers to the TransFormers franchise: their game, War for Cybertron, proves this by paying homage to many of the numerous incarnations of these characters, yet still telling its own unique tale.The core concept is similar to the War Within comic series by Simon Furman: it takes place at the zenith of the civil war fought between the Autobots and Decepticons, where the tide seemingly turns as the Decepticon leader, Megatron gains new powers by taming the dark powers of energon (the lifeblood of these robots); and the only thing that can stand in his way is a newly-elected Autobot Prime, Optimus, and his faithful soldiers.This story is presented in a co-op third-person shooter format, which in single-player translates to the player controlling one of the three robots and gaining two computer-controlled allies. These allies are immortal, but their contribution mostly stops at being additional targets. Still, this helps in many situations, sometimes leading to a surprising level of strategy. And to make things better, the trios talk a lot, so there is never a dull moment during the levels. I cannot say gameplay is perfect though. Not counting technical issues like locked frame rate or unchangeable controls, there are design problems like a lack of ammunition, rendering many weapons with small magazines virtually useless. Some parts also feel untested and incredibly unfair, the final boss fights being the most notorious.With the constant presence of these issues, I can only recommend this otherwise good game for those who are in no shortage of patience—especially if they like to play on higher difficulties.

												Rating 6.5/10Overview: Third Person Shooter The Good: + Surprisingly good graphics despite its age. + The characters, story, dialogue and voice acting is perfect and does a brilliant job of representing the transformers universe. + Transforming between two forms is fast and fluid and more feels vey natural. You can transform at any time. Switching between the two forms is necessary to complete levels but also provide certain tactical advantages in combat. + Controls very well + Choose between your favorite transformers each with their own unique abilities. + Plenty of different guns to choose fromThe Average:Lack of enemy variety, starts feeling repetitive killing the same enemies repeatedly. The game doesn’t change up the gameplay formula….kill enemies move on to the next area…repeat.The Bad: - Every level has the ‘cut and paste’ environment feeling to it. Between the ten levels, its hard to differentiate between them, they all look, feel and play the same. - The pc port is somewhat lacking on the technical front. 30 fps for no good reason, lack of graphical options etc. -multiplayer is long dead Conclusion:One of the better 6.5 games that I’ve played. It certainly a lot of fun especially for transformers fans but after completing the game there isn’t much reason to go back to it. Despite its shortcomings, it was obvious the developers understood the transformers universe and did a great job telling a story.  ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												This game is something made for fans, and only fans, it is not a hard game if you actually know what you're doing, the decepticon and autobot campaigns are very interesting, and the fact that you get to play as both sides is a nice touch, the story is interesting and the gameplay is enjoyable, this is a must buy for any fan.

												I'm huge Transformers fan and before recommending War for Cybertron let's talk a bit about Transformers. The best Transformers show ever is Beast Wars. Nothing is even close. If Hasbro didn't interfere it could be perfect show. G1 is only ""great"" because of nostalgia. It was nothing more than commercial for toys in the form of cartoon – season 2 episodes are pure commercials, you can watch them in random order because they are not connected in any way! Why I mention this?Well, WfC is mix of BW and G1. It has very good storytelling and focus on handful number of Transformers just like BW, but in terms of actual story and presentation it's heavily influenced by G1. According to Hasbro, the game is part of the same aligned continuity family as Exodus novel and Prime cartoon (joke show), except in reality there are big differencies.First, it's a must to install the latest PhysX driver otherwise game won't even start!Use SweetFX to drastically enchance graphics.Pros+ excellent story+ no Bay s.it+ Transformers mostly look and are characterised like G1 counterparts+ you can always choose between three Transformers before every mission and every one of them has unique specials+ in every mission you are accompanied by two other Transformers+ QTEs are almost non-existingCons- game is locked in 30 fps (it can be unlocked)- graphics is a bit dated (SweetFX fix it)- both campaigns are mostly carbon copy in terms of enemies and missions- level 8 defending Omega Supreme is impossible on medium difficulty after 75% recharging because Decepticons just easily kill Ratchet and than you- no Steamworks integration: it's a shame because 360/PS3 version has 51 achievements/trophies! Really devs?- MP is expectedly mostly dead, but there are few players in the eveningAll in all, High Moon Studios did good job. Must buy for every Transformers fan.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

												Great game for fans of Transformers, and those who may not be so familiar with the series. Has about 8-10 hours of story mode that are well worth it, and this game goes on sale every once in a while, I would just wait for it to go on sale again. Got it for $5, and it's a steal of a value at that price.			",72,9,0,9,2,0,1

												To be honest, I love the transformers movies. It's how I grew up. When i finished, I always thought, "" how did they come to earth?"" This game Shares the whole story, and Transformers: Fall of cybertron continues that story. Pros- Great storyline- Fair gameplay- Online Co-op- Play as either side- All the characters that you love :)Cons- Difficult multiplayer system- You can't ram cars in vehicle mode. I mean, SERIOUSLY?- Bots aren't as helpful to you- If anyone dies in co-op, or if any bots die in singleplayer, you gotta restart (A.K.A No revive system)- Only one healing weaponUltimatly, this is what I think about the game. It's up to you if you really want the game. I hope my input helped!			",189,21,0,4,4,3,8

												Transformers was like my FAVORITE thing as a little kid and Optimus Prime was my HERO! This game shows the lore and the war of the days of Cybertron and the Autobot's struggle against the Decipticons. It has decent graphics, since the game is a few years old, great mechanics with a controller or mouse and keyboard, and a good storyline. You start off with the Decepticon campaign, then the Autobots, but you can decide when to start off at. Transforming into a vehicle never gets old and seriously helps you sometimes. It has a campaign where there's 3 characters to play as and the Co-Op campaign makes it re-playable. However, my only problems (this a a preference) were the style of the graphics vs. the graphics of Fall of Cybertron. (an even better game!) I''d give this game a 9/10			",54,1,0,5,3,0,2

												Good graphic performance of DirectX 9 and Unreal Engine 3,which are suitable for building and displaying high sharpness and metal surface.In a word,the world of the transformers,the home of the robotic giants:Cybertron is full of miracles.Music not impressive,and not so good as those of Fall of Cybertron.Invironment of many levels seems duplicated.Last level of facing Trypticon in hard mode is a little bit too difficult for the players who want to go through the game in that difficulty directly.Seems no steam cloud or other in-game saved game online synchronization and save files might need to be stored by players themselves for preparation of restoring them before they are damaged or lost.

												This is the Transformers game that made me break free of the illusions that Bay tried to make out of this franchise. Only then did I come to the conclusion that this was what I wanted to see from Transformers. I have spent so many hours on this game 6 years ago, I even beat it on the hardest difficulty on my Xbox! Now, I can relive those days all over again. The story is good and the chapters are long but worth playing through.			",10,2,0,2,1,0,0

												Ok, I just finished this game. I loved it. I am a transformers nerd (No doubt about that) and this game (I think anyways) tends to be very underrated. I recommend it to anyone who likes/loves transformers, sometimes it seems like there's a lot happening on the screen at any one time but that is part of why I love this game. The dialog (especially Thundercracker and Skywarp) can is very entertaning, but it's not constantly jokes-and-puns, so it's not overbearing. Anywho, I love this game, if you like Transformers and thirdperson shooter games, you probably will too!			",38,4,0,3,2,0,0

												'Transformers: War for Cybertron' was designed for 'Transformers' fans, especially those who grew up watching the first generation of 'Transformers' (G1) cartoons and playing with the toys. While the aesthetics of the Transformers in the game were partly inspired by the robots in Michael Bay's movies, the robots thankfully looked much more like the G1 Transformers for the most part.'War for Cybertron' is a serviceable third-person action game. If it were not for the transforming robots, the game will not be as enjoyable. The developers did an excellent job in designing Cybertron. The environments were rendered and textured in great detail, and really provided an immersive gamespace. This was particularly evident in the second chapter of the game, which was one of my favourites.Perhaps it is because I grew up watching the colourful G1 cartoons, but I find it unfortunate that the game's colour palette was predominantly shades of grey, red, purple and brown. Most parts of 'War for Cybertron' were so dark that, if it were not for the glowing stripes on the robots (à la 'Tron'), I would have had an even harder time seeing the enemy. While the playable Decepticons were similarly chromatically muted, the playable Autobots were thankfully more colourful and had more distinctive robot and vehicle designs. The game is divided into two parts, with the first featuring Decepticons as playable characters, and the second Autobots. Maybe because I am partial to Autobots, but I find the second half much more enjoyable. The game is mainly travelling from arena to arena, clearing each arena of enemies, and repeating this multiple times until you reach a boss battle. This got boring by Chapters 3 or 4, but the Autobot-centric chapters thankfully offered some variations to the formula. The better action setpieces and pacing of the Autobot chapters culminated in a spectacular conclusion.Despite the mediocrity of 'War for Cybertron', I will give it my lukewarm recommendation because of the game's strong second half. If you're not a big 'Transformers' fan, you can skip this game. It is worth a try -- especially the second chapter and the Autobot chapters -- if you can buy it at discount like I did. Otherwise, you may be better off playing 'Transformers: Fall of Cybertron' and 'Transformers: Devestation', both of which I heard are much better 'Transformers' games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is what a Transformers movie could be like if we can somehow rescue the IP from the clutches of Michael Bay. And you even get to play a few scenes in it!Ok, snideness aside, what you have here is a decent, solid 3rd person shooter, a bit shallow on the tactical side but then again, rather stingy with the ammo for a pure relaxing glue-the-mouse-button-down zero-skill bang fest. The difficulty settings are sensible, easy does mean ""you can let your 5 year old kid who is a huge Transformers fan play it and he'll make it"", while hard does indeed cause a lot of headaches. Mostly 'cause the controls don't really allow a lot of tactical maneuvering and damage avoidance.That's maybe also my biggest problem with the game. There isn't really much ""skill"" involved.  And the basic material was really offering a lot of options in this area. There could be some moves where you could transform from robot to vehicle and back for some sweet actions, you could probably, I don't know, climb on walls, run down the wall, transform in mid air, kick up the speed, go over a ramp, transform in mid air again and grasp on a ledge ... That WOULD be awesome.Not going to happen, though. Transforming is a rather tedious and static process, don't expect to use that as part of a tactical move. You can drive, which is fast but limited in maneuverability, or you can walk as a robot, which gives you more precision over your movements but makes you slower. So what's left is a decent 3rd person shooter. Nothing great, nothing fancy, but certainly something everyone who grew up with Transformers will want to play. The story is quite predictable (so it fits perfectly with the old Transformers cartoons) but very well told, the voice acting is, well, not great but most of the time at least decent (again, fits perfectly with the old cartoons), with the usual overacting of the minor characters (again, like the cartoons). The only thing missing is the cheesy intro.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. I played it on the PS3 first, maxed everything out and started playing escalation regularly. My friends and I launched ourselves to the top of the escalation leaderboards, becoming frustrated at the bugs plaguing the PS3 version that prevented you from playing escalation indefinitely. When you made it so far in the PS3 version of escalation, the game would for some reason begin to glitch and freeze after some time, causing you to lose all your points. Eventually, we decided we would glitch through the walls and jump off the map to kill ourselves at wave 50 so we didn't lose all our points when we inevitably froze. Then the PS3 network got hacked, and I went out and bought a 360 (after the network was down for two weeks) literally JUST to play this game. I of course got the Halo games and Skyrim and other fun games for 360, but I mostly played WFC. Then I got my new job and games had much less time in my life, but this one always held a place in my heart. Eventually I made the jump to a PC and built my first rig, buying this game as soon as I downloaded Steam. This game is the best. I love how they captured the feel of Cybertron and the feel of G1. The drop-in drop-out co-op is an excellent system to play through the campaign with your friends. Though I will say that a big flaw of that system is the limited availability of the weapons and ammo for all three players. Even more annoying is when a noob joins and dies constantly and causes you to keep replaying the same part of that mission until they either leave or somehow make it through.Multiplayer, while fun, is dead. Even when it's not dead, hackers are a constant annoyance. They are the worst.I mostly focus on escalation now, as I did before. The online community for this game is very limited, as there are few people who want to play a nearly six year old Transfomers game that was a ""meh"" port at best. Online communications are non existent. In game, you are required to make a new account to play. You don't need to register an Email address or anything, just type a name in and if it's not taken then it's yours. You add friends you meet online by typing in their names and waiting for them to accept your request. There is no voice chat, there is no text chat. The port to PC was lazily and hastily done and the online experience suffers as a result. The framerate is also capped at 30FPS for no damn reason. Thankfully, Googling ""Transformers: War for Cybertron frame unlocker"" will lead you to a third-party free-to-use tool that can unlock it for you. And they also chose to not allow DLC for this game which is crap. You can unlock the characters through googling ""Transformers: War for Cybertron coalesced.ini"" which will lead you to a guide and a new ini file which fixes a few things and allows you to play as the DLC characters, but doesn't give you the maps. The new maps were awesome, and I think that PC players are seriously missing out on those maps because High Moon was too damn lazy to make a proper PC port. After you download those two things though, the game is much more enjoyable.All in all, it's a great, amazing Transformers experience. I love it. I've always loved it, and will play it for as long as it continues to be supported. But user beware, there is very little of the online community that once populated this game left. If you have a PS3 or 360, I would recommend playing it on either of those platforms instead, but the 360 will be more enjoyable. And you'll be able to get a used copy for the consoles much cheaper I'm sure. Still, if you must play it on PC, it's still a blast. Despite my griping, I would highly recommend this game to anyone with a soft spot for Transformers, or who enjoys a well built, fun to play, fast paced shooter.			",104,3,0,7,5,0,1

Posted: April 16, 2016
												Okay so I have played through this game about 3 times on PS3 and 1 time on PC and I have to say this is one of the best games I have ever played. Both campaign and multiplayer are outstanding and mind blowing. The campaign allows options for multiple characters each level so the variety is great between players. However the games combat can get somewhat reppetitive (especially on your 3rd playthrough) throughout the story. The game allows for a point of view on both the autobots and decepticons sides of the war on cybertron, and it allows for many playable characters on both sides. The games campaign was very amazing to see how the was was for both sides. Although the gameplay was amazing the AI enemies were mostly smart and okay but very few glitched out or just misbehaved. The bossfights for the most part were great however the final boss (not spoiling anything but if you played it you know who it is) was somehwat underwelming. After I completed the amazing campaign I stepped into multiplayer and although it doesnt allow for the best character customization, it still gets the job done. The multiplayer although somewhat empty due to how old the game is is somewhat empty. I found that the most players online at a single time averaged about 8-11. The multiplayer is outstanding and after many hours still great to play. You can choose your weapons and abilities and then use them in multiplayer. You can also choose your vehicle as either a car, tank, or plane (plane is best). The weapons have many options from assault rifles to shotguns to snipers. The maps are all very different, most are medium size to big which will allow for different play styles for all different players. The graphics hold up well especially for a 7 year old game (or however old it is) and on max settings can even compete with some (but not many) current games coming out today. Anyway this game is amazing and you should definetly consider buying it if you havent done so already. 9.8/10			",30,2,0,6,2,0,1

												I love this game. I played it on the PS3 first, maxed everything out and started playing escalation regularly. My friends and I launched ourselves to the top of the escalation leaderboards, becoming frustrated at the bugs plaguing the PS3 version that prevented you from playing escalation indefinitely. When you made it so far in the PS3 version of escalation, the game would for some reason begin to glitch and freeze after some time, causing you to lose all your points. Eventually, we decided we would glitch through the walls and jump off the map to kill ourselves at wave 50 so we didn't lose all our points when we inevitably froze. Then the PS3 network got hacked, and I went out and bought a 360 (after the network was down for two weeks) literally JUST to play this game. I of course got the Halo games and Skyrim and other fun games for 360, but I mostly played WFC. Then I got my new job and games had much less time in my life, but this one always held a place in my heart. Eventually I made the jump to a PC and built my first rig, buying this game as soon as I downloaded Steam. This game is the best. I love how they captured the feel of Cybertron and the feel of G1. The drop-in drop-out co-op is an excellent system to play through the campaign with your friends. Though I will say that a big flaw of that system is the limited availability of the weapons and ammo for all three players. Even more annoying is when a noob joins and dies constantly and causes you to keep replaying the same part of that mission until they either leave or somehow make it through.Multiplayer, while fun, is dead. Even when it's not dead, hackers are a constant annoyance. They are the worst.I mostly focus on escalation now, as I did before. The online community for this game is very limited, as there are few people who want to play a nearly six year old Transfomers game that was a ""meh"" port at best. Online communications are non existent. In game, you are required to make a new account to play. You don't need to register an Email address or anything, just type a name in and if it's not taken then it's yours. You add friends you meet online by typing in their names and waiting for them to accept your request. There is no voice chat, there is no text chat. The port to PC was lazily and hastily done and the online experience suffers as a result. The framerate is also capped at 30FPS for no damn reason. Thankfully, Googling ""Transformers: War for Cybertron frame unlocker"" will lead you to a third-party free-to-use tool that can unlock it for you. And they also chose to not allow DLC for this game which is crap. You can unlock the characters through googling ""Transformers: War for Cybertron coalesced.ini"" which will lead you to a guide and a new ini file which fixes a few things and allows you to play as the DLC characters, but doesn't give you the maps. The new maps were awesome, and I think that PC players are seriously missing out on those maps because High Moon was too damn lazy to make a proper PC port. After you download those two things though, the game is much more enjoyable.All in all, it's a great, amazing Transformers experience. I love it. I've always loved it, and will play it for as long as it continues to be supported. But user beware, there is very little of the online community that once populated this game left. If you have a PS3 or 360, I would recommend playing it on either of those platforms instead, but the 360 will be more enjoyable. And you'll be able to get a used copy for the consoles much cheaper I'm sure. Still, if you must play it on PC, it's still a blast. Despite my griping, I would highly recommend this game to anyone with a soft spot for Transformers, or who enjoys a well built, fun to play, fast paced shooter.			",104,3,0,7,5,0,1

												Okay so I have played through this game about 3 times on PS3 and 1 time on PC and I have to say this is one of the best games I have ever played. Both campaign and multiplayer are outstanding and mind blowing. The campaign allows options for multiple characters each level so the variety is great between players. However the games combat can get somewhat reppetitive (especially on your 3rd playthrough) throughout the story. The game allows for a point of view on both the autobots and decepticons sides of the war on cybertron, and it allows for many playable characters on both sides. The games campaign was very amazing to see how the was was for both sides. Although the gameplay was amazing the AI enemies were mostly smart and okay but very few glitched out or just misbehaved. The bossfights for the most part were great however the final boss (not spoiling anything but if you played it you know who it is) was somehwat underwelming. After I completed the amazing campaign I stepped into multiplayer and although it doesnt allow for the best character customization, it still gets the job done. The multiplayer although somewhat empty due to how old the game is is somewhat empty. I found that the most players online at a single time averaged about 8-11. The multiplayer is outstanding and after many hours still great to play. You can choose your weapons and abilities and then use them in multiplayer. You can also choose your vehicle as either a car, tank, or plane (plane is best). The weapons have many options from assault rifles to shotguns to snipers. The maps are all very different, most are medium size to big which will allow for different play styles for all different players. The graphics hold up well especially for a 7 year old game (or however old it is) and on max settings can even compete with some (but not many) current games coming out today.

												If you are a fan of Transformers I would recomend War for Cybertron as High Moon studios has put a great deal of effort to pay homage to the Transformers we knew as a kid. However if you are not a transformers fan I would say that you might want to pass or wait and by it on sale as gameplay wise Its an average third person shooter at best. It doesn't do anything bad but also doesn't do anything you haven't seen befor. The Voice acting though is spot on and it also has a nice OST with lots of Heavy Metal influance. Also MP is a little dead so might be hard to find people to play with if/when the servers are up.			",81,40,0,37,14,1,18

												Note: This review is for the solo campaign mode only.Note 2: The game is locked at 30 fps by default. You can download an uncapper (see the game's PCGamingWiki entry) that will allow you to unlock the frame rate with no negative gameplay effects. With the uncapper, I was able to get 60 fps most of the time on my i5-3470/GTX 970 system. There were still sporadic moments where it would dip back into the 30s for a few seconds, though this happened even on minimum settings, so I have to assume this was just the result of some flaw that the uncapper couldn't fix rather than my hardware. These were rare enough to not negatively affect my enjoyment of the game.Gameplay review: This game is actually the first Transformers story I've ever experienced in any medium and I enjoyed the story more than I was expecting. I think a lot of that has to do with the great voice acting.The gameplay is generic, but satisfying, third-person shooting that succeeds because of the sheer amount of spectacle. It's quite linear but the strong pacing kept me interested regardless.The game is split into two five-mission campaigns: the initial Decepticon campaign, which features Megatron doing generic evil genius stuff, and the Autobot campaign, in which Optimus attempts to foil Megatron's plans.While the gameplay between the two campaigns is mostly the same, the Autobot campaign is much harder than the Decepticon campaign. I played on hard, and despite the campaigns having the same number of levels, it took me 4 hours to beat the Decepticon campaign and 10 hours to beat the Autobot campaign. Even on hard, the Decepticon campaign is staggeringly easy, but the degree of difficulty ramps up massively in the second mission of the Autobot campaign and remains that way until the end of the game. The main reason for this is a difference in the design of the combat spaces between the two campaigns: Levels in the Decepticon campaign tend to feature lots of linear corridors and small rooms with plenty of cover, which means you can stand behind cover and blast enemies to your heart's content. Rooms also usually only feature 3-5 enemies at most. However, in the Autobot campaign, you're frequently placed into large arena-like spaces with very limited cover, limited health pick-ups, and overwhelming numbers of spongey enemies. Dodging and pinpoint accuracy become essential for survival. The degree with which the difficulty increases almost made me give up, but I stuck it out until the end I guess through stubbornness?If you don't like being frustrated by your games, you might want to play this one on medium. If you like a real challenge, play on hard, and you'll find what you're looking for once you get through the first five easy levels.			",241,34,0,23,12,0,25

												Buy? Maybe.-=TL;DR=-It's a solid, but standard non-cover based third person shooter that's  respectful to the Transformer universe and not related to the Michael Bay films. The campaign is generally well-paced (though, levels were a tad longer than I wanted) and provided a mostly fufilling insight into the backstory of the Transformers. Multiplayer is dead (0 players in any playlist), though co-op has about 30-70 regularl players as of June 2014, though I find it inferior to other popular co-op horde shooters. WFC is a no brainer for Transformers fans, and a good buy at a sale for others. It's clearly a console port with no rebindable keys, no achievements, no form of multiplayer chat (on a PC shooter? Are you kidding me?) and a 29 FPS cap (fixable with a 3rd party software)-=Presentation=-WFC looks last gen: many textures are blurry, especially on boss type enemies, polygon edges are clearly visible on round objects , and plays at a capped 29FPS. The game isn't ugly (except for close ups on some textures) and looks great for it's time. I love cyber/techpunk environments, so I enjoy the sci-fi look of the game. While the world does suffers from typical shooter browngrey syndrome, theres' many splashes of color thanks to lighting effects of objects and certain background features as well as the robots themselves.Transformers fans will like that this has no relation to the Michael Bay films. While still 90% action and explosions, you're not dealing with humans and none of the immature humor  is here. Thankfully, comedy mostly come from interactions with specific characters, but without the corniness of the orignal toon. WFC, in my opinion, provides a great insight into the Transformers origins, as somebody who has only seen limited viewings of the original and Armada cartoons as well as the Bay films. You get a better sense of why the robots are fighting, instead of ""those bots are purple and bad and must be defeated by the nice, red robots"" and the amount of destruction and ""death"" of Transformer-kind gives you context into why the war is such a big deal to them. That said, the Decepticon side seems a bit stupid if they want to complete their goal, as Megatron's philosophy boils down to ""destroy everything and kill those who are weak"". You don't get the ability to revive non-essential NPCs until the Autobot campaign - Megatron doesn't want to help his fellow army, but ♥♥♥♥♥es if he isn't healed. Thankfully, he isn't as stupid as he was in the show, as he wants to kill Starscream who clearly intends on betraying him, but simply doesn't have the time or the ability to thanks to the war and their locations at the time.It's absolutely fantastic that they have the original Optimus Prime voice actor who is among my all time favorite voices. I don't know if any other character voices are from the original show, but most of the main characters are fit perfectly. The soundtrack isn't must-have, but there are some nice epic/rock themes and the original 80's hair metal theme in the credits is delightful to hear. The majority of the music fits the setting well.-=Gameplay=-Gameplay here is uninteresting besides transforming. This provides faster movement and a 3rd or 4th weapon depending on the bot. In some cases, the transformation for some bots is a little OP as you might be able to constantly hover, dodge and shoot with unlimited ammo, compared to the limited ammo of ground weapons which can easily be drained if you're not accurate and using melee and abiliites.  Vehicle mode is either used to travel a long distance or to escape. Thankfully, controlling the vehicle is fairly easy - it makes me wonder why there isn't some ""Transformers Arena"" car combat/racing game spinoff based off this mechanic. Oddly enough, vehicle mode feels very slow compared to driving a car in most games, and is really more of a sprint for these guys. Considering their size, it probably would look faster compared to a human, but looks slow in the context of Transformers.There's no cover system, so survival is mostly about killing the enemy first and hiding. As I said before, ammo is a problem in bot mode, so you must be accurate and use melee often. All bots have two abilities, one goverened by a cooldown and the other by energon pickups from killed enemies. I rarely used them due to their limited use and usually, it was better to stay at range and shoot, instead of using abilities, with a few exceptions. Occasionally, you will also have grenades. Also, it never pays to be a healer player in the campaign, your two sidekicks never die and if you're the healing player, then the other teammates won't be able to heal you. Like most shooters, the majority of enemies go down faster than you, though you can get killed pretty easily if you're not careful. It's inconsistent as you watch scenes of bots fighting head to head while you must run cover to cover to fight against groups. You wlll also do 98% of the combat work and 100% of the ""Press E to interact"" work (except for when team mates use turrets), but thankfully, your teammates are half-decent at attracing some fire from you and killing a few enemies here and there.I did like that the final battle was against an albiet cliche, giant, big bad robot. But the battle itself was cheesy and annoying - the boss can kill you relatively easily with missles that almost never miss (and honestly, he should be able to just grab and crush or smash the Autobots with ease), yet, you can hide yourself in an alcove on the left side of the map and take no damage. It's very stupid to go from, ""How the hell do I survive these impossible rockets"" to ""Let's huddle here in this spot indefinitely while the boss shoots at the cover with futility"". The overall battle was a pretty lame ""shoot explosive containers"" and then ""hit the weakpoint for massive damage"" trope.Don't buy this for Multiplayer - even with 69 players online, nobody was playing it. The Co-op is where most of these people are at. At it's core, it's a fairly decent ""kill waves of enemies you fought in campaign"" while earning points. However, the point system is massively flawed - if you join a room late in the game, you will  run out of ammo shooting enemies that require tons of damage and can kill you fast. And since the ONLY way to get points is to kill enemies (that's right, no points for assists or anything else), you won't be able to buy weapons, help team mates open doors, restock ammo or even just restore health. While sharing points to open doors or purchase items is neat, it's absolutely incompetent that you can get stuck with no chance of redemption unless you start in an early round or get the last hit like a MOBA. Some of you can probably put up with it if you have a decent team and you START AT THE FIRST WAVE, but the Co-op from Mass Effect 3 and Warframe are better in every aspect.-=Conclusion=-WFC does justice to the Transformer universe, and I'm looking forward to Fall of Cybertron since I've heard good reviews. The gameplay is solid, though, largely unremarkable except for the transformer mechanic, in which honestly, I didn't use often, except for when I could abuse unlimited ammo. The overall presentation is pretty good and in some cases awesome. It can be beat in about 10-12 hours and I recommend medium difficulty - even though I can play well on hard, it made some sections irritating and I just want to clear my backlog. $20 would generally be a fair price, but in the era of PC game discounts and bundles, Activision should sell this no more than $15. Wait for a sale where it's often less than $10.			",965,265,43,131,97,11,157

												*****WARNING! FANBOY REVIEW ALERT!*****This game is amazing af! Even after 6 years, this game is still a fresh, attractive game.In a nutshell:Gameplay - 8/10 So varies. You can play this game in many many ways! TPS, FPS, racing or Plane shooter. But can be rather dull compared to many video game these days.Graphic - 8/10 Somewhat attractive. The game has both elements of cartoon-ish and realistic art style. This might not suitable for hardcore gamers. But for anyone who love dark, dull and serious tone, I recommended this game for sure.Plot and Story - 9/10 There might be some unnoticeable flaws or plot hole. For anyone who are a fan of Transformers, It wouldn't be so confusing nor senseless. But for new comers I recommend you to do some research on Transformers lore. There are numerous ""continuities"" and ""universe"" and each of them has different plot and characters. FYI: This game and FOC are set in the ""Aligned Continuity Universe"".Special Features - 6/10 not at much extras as Fall of Cybertron but good enough. The game has Multiplayer mode and Escalation mode(AKA, Zombie mode, wave mode, zombie wave mode, bla bla bla) Multiplayer will allow you to play Co-op in the singleplayer campaign which isn't that good but enjoyable. But it's 2017. The multiplayer community is dead and only few are still playing it.Overall - 9/10 As a TF fanboy, I love this game.*************Caution GEEWUNNER aren't allowed**************************This game might hurt your eyes as hell************			",8,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's not that long however (somewhere around 6 to 8 hours in hard to finish the game).Graphically speaking, it's ok. Nothing fancy but ok.Recommended for the fans or on sale.			",95,6,0,12,0,0,16

												I am frankly amazed by how well they have managed to capture the spirit of the series.  I wish this was on Earth, but so it goes.  The way that Cybertron is represented here is surprisingly varied and interesting.  The voice acting is also surprisingly good, and the game does a great job of giving you constant allies playing with you without making it so that they do all the work or feel completely useless (though they mostly are, which is fine with me).Transforming between forms is FUN, and I love the variety of going through various types of vehicles and planes and so forth.  Plus finding some of the backstory behind the series is really a big plus for me as a fan of the franchise and a toy collector (and now comics reader) of the series.			",338,76,9,38,50,4,55

												Transformers War for Cybertron is a beautiful third pesron shooter with great controls, an awesome story, decent voice acting, an awesome campaign, a fun multiplayer, and amazing sound effects! This game is really something special. The story beats anything Michael Bay could ever imagine and the gameplay is flawless. I loved exploring the half destroyed metalic citys of Cybertron. I just wish that the game wasnt as linear as it is. It would have been stupendous to have been able to explore Cybertron as I pleased and to experience everything it had to offer. Overall, War for Cybertron takes transformers to the next level. If you are a transformers fan, this is a must have. I just wish that the gameplay wasn't as linear. I give Transformers WFC a 9/10.

												Quite ok if you like the Transformers universe.I really liked the idea of playing the campaign from the 2 perspectives (Decepticon first and Autobot second).The campaign itself could have been better, but it's still enjoyable to discover the war between the 2 factions that led to the destruction of Cybertron. It's not that long however (somewhere around 6 to 8 hours in hard to finish the game).Graphically speaking, it's ok. Nothing fancy but ok.Recommended for the fans or on sale.			",95,6,0,12,0,0,16

												The voice acting alone makes this game worth buying. Combat is fun. Always something happening. There's 5 Chapters for the Decepticons and 5 for the autobots. Multiplayer was pretty dead when I checked but that doesn't mean it's non-exsistant I haven't played very long yet. No cover system and there probably should be one but thats not a game breaker at all. I feel like I've already got my moneys worth and you will too.			",226,32,3,18,5,1,9

												Good game. But after playing for a few hours this game is design to be pretty forward. Go forward forward kill enemy open door kill boss the end. Next stage. I prefer the gameplay where the level design is a bit more sohphiscated where user can actually hide/cover behind object and flank them.Secondly this game has no upgrade and no new charecter unlock. Making this game a forward linear game. Once you done that played that. You will not come back again. Lastly I would say this game is faily short. So pick this game if only you are true transformers fan.Autobots roll out.			",38,13,1,11,2,1,18

												Transformers War For Cybertron is a love letter to the 1980's era Transformers and if you're a fan of the series young or old you'll probably find something to love about Transformers Fall of Cybertron, and have enough fond feelings to overlook some of the problems this PC port has.The game play is third person action shooter that has you running gunning and transforming. Most sections are designed for robot combat and you'll strafe around shooting at the opposition but a few areas are designed for mobility in mind where transforming into your vehicle mode is required. These segments are well done and the transition from robot to vehicle feels as good as you'd expect it should. The shooting segments can get repetitive and with out a cover option you'll find yourself mostly strafing back and forth to avoid fire which feels a bit clunky. You'll often find your friendly AI companions getting in the way and they 're really only there for you to have a choice of one of three characters to choose from at the beginning of each mission and for bantering back and forth. There was never a time I felt like they did any thing to help me, and a few times where they got in the way. Multilayer is a lot more fun then I expected. You level up your class, customize skills based off your play style. Its actually pretty diverse and fun. The game can be visually cluttered at times, as a living robotic planet with lots of moving parts is important to the setting but can get sort of messy on screen when laser battles are breaking out and you're shifting in between robot and vehicle forms but it's a minor complaint. If you play with a controller it's a bit annoying that it's only partially supported, so get used to memorizing buttons as every in-game prompt you see will be keyboard & mouse specific. I never ran into any major problems because of this but it was annoying. All and all a fun time to be had, especially if you're a fan of the series. And it's got a Stan Bush song... What else can I say?			",240,26,2,32,14,2,15

												Hands down the greatest series of games ever to carry the Transformers moniker. This series is a love letter to fans of the first generation of Transformers with many of the original voice actors and character designs that are much more reminiscent of the of the generation 1 era. Set before the Transformers make their way to Earth, this game tells the backstory for many of your favorite characters. A plethora of weapon upgrades and the ability to Transform at will make for a very fun and dynamic 3rd person shooter. If you grew up watching Transformers, like me, then this game is an absoulte must.			",81,10,1,16,1,2,18

												Raise your hand if you like Third/First Person shooters. Raise your hand if you like Racing games. I cant see you, but I bet theres more than a few hands raised. Transformers War for Cybertron mixes those genre together. Fast action, a shifting terrain, and some intense graphics. This game does only what Transformers can: Let you shoot people, then turn into a car/tank/plane, and splatter them. This game requires a rather beefy graphics card, or just an 800x600 resolution and low graphics to run smoothly :P Please buy, and play multiplayer. Theres only about 1 server ever going, with a combined attendance of Pros and No0bs. THe campaign is also phenomenal. After building my insane rig, I was depressed that I only got 30 FPS. I recently downloaded TransformersWarForCybertronFPSUnlocker, (TWFC_Unlocker), which is a standalone program you can run in the background that unlocks the framerate. 60 looks SO much bettter than 30...

												Expectacular juego de acción en tercera persona! La verdad esta excelente todo prácticamente, la historia esta copada y cuenta los 2 puntos de vista, con una campaña para Decepticons y una para Autobots. Los transformers están recontra bien animados y las transformaciones son re copadas, se puede ver como las distintas partes de los robots se mueven solas, cuando están inactivos; de la misma manera que un humano flexionando un musculo por ejemplo. Los niveles son grandes y variados, con unas cuantas secuencias de combate aereo y lo que calificaria como carreras tambien. Para ser un juego basado en una serie/comic esta claramente por encima de juegos similares, se nota que sus creadores aman la franquicia. Definitivamente recomendado.			",174,49,6,24,29,1,88

												Quem curte Transformers e quem curte jogo de tiro em 3ª pessoa futurista vai amar esse jogo.Ação frenética, uma quantidade enorme de armas variadas, e é claro, veículos também. Cada personagem se transforma em um veículo diferente, dando ao jogo um fator re-play muito grande.O melhor do jogo é encontrado no Co-op, onde você pode contar com a ajuda de dois amigos no modo campanha, deixando o jogo ainda mais divertido.O modo Multi-player é bem divertido também, com uma comunidade razoável de jogadores. Os gráficos são realmente impressionantes, muito bem trabalhados e cheios de detalhes.Uma boa escolha para quem quer um FPS diferente e chio de momentos de ação.Nota: 10/10Por: Fernando Innecco.

I loved being able to Transform whenever I wanted and the firefights were fun to shoot out.  Can't wait to get Fall Of Cybertron.			",136,18,0,23,13,0,21

												This game has a fun co-op campaign mode, as well as a survival mode (""Escalation"") and online multiplayer. It's an enjoyable, straightforward third-person shooter that facilitates transformation between vehicle and humanoid forms. The Decepticons in particular have some fun missions, and the two air missions (Decepticon and Autobot respectively) are both fun, too.			",229,69,2,24,11,1,12

												Surprisingly decent.  Not an amazing game by any means, but it's a competent shooter, and if you like the old G1 Transformers over the new movie crap you'll appreciate that it sticks fairly close to the originals with the characters it uses and the prequel/origin storyline they went with.

												Transformers was aight. It was mildly interesting getting the back story to what happened close to right before the beginning of the cartoon I watched 25 years ago. The combat was kinda fun. The best parts are the flying levels. The campaign is one story that starts off with the Decepticons doing their dirt, then switches to the Autobots trying to undo what the Decepticons just did. Playing either side feels like the same experience. When playing either side, there's the flying ones, the foot soldiers, the invisible guys, the big  mammoth final boss. Also, it seems like every transformer changes into the same looking car. Megatron and Sound Wave transform into cars, who knew? The game falls a little flat in the weapons department and utilizing the ability to transform too. The weapons aren't very exciting and the Transformers ability to change into vehicles feels like just another mechanic and not something the game was necessarily designed around. The game looks well, but the only video option that can be adjusted is the texture settings. You're definitely going to want to dl and run the frame rate unlocker as the default is capped at 30fps and makes the game look like♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you really love the Transformers or are just curious about the game, I'd recommend getting it when it's on sale. It wasn't terrible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't express how refreshing my time in Cybertron was.In an era of shooters existing solely in the first person, in a modern day setting in America, Russia or a non-specific Middle-Eastern country as some kind of human-lizard hybrid who can regenerate his lost limbs Optimus Prime shows us what a good shooter used to be like. The game is an old school, third-person, corridor, twitch shooter with health packs and power ups. The budget is surprisingly high: the scripted events, animations and graphics are all top-notch and kick the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the movies. The plot and dialoge are paper thin, but who cares? You're a giant ♥♥♥♥ing robot with guns for hands who can turn into a jet! The controlls are okay. They're not customizable at all making it blatantly obvious that this is a port. The soundtrack is filled with mediocre metal music with droning guitars and simplistic drums, but most of the time it's drowned out by the screams of Decepticons. A worthy game even for non-fans.

												First off let me just say that this is the best Transformers game that I have ever played (Transformers: Fall of Cybertron is also good, but I won't count that because its the sequel to this game). If you are the kind of person who has grown up with the original transformers TV show, then you will definitely like this game. The storyline is well-crafted and deep, and the gameplay is amazing. When you play through the storyline, there are two factions (Autobots and Decepticons) that you play as. With many character choices and weapons, the versitality of the way you fight is very high. In the multiplayer, you can choose a character and customize their colors, weapons, abilities, and equipment. All in all though, this game is worth the money.8.5/10			",60,2,1,9,2,0,1

												This feels so much as a prequel to G1… Man, it’s awesome!I usually frown on redesigns of G1 transformers (like the ones of the movies and recent cartons) but these redesigns work. They work, look cool and feel right at home on the setting (Cybertron).Any keen eyed G1 fan knows that the Decepticons had a lot of lookalike jobbers, and that even the autobots had some on the first episodes. Well, this happens before that, so jobbers are expected but why are they so cool looking?In the end the game is a good shooter. I usually don’t like those types of games, but damn, this one feels good. I’m a real stickler to tight controls and responsiveness. But even so for me, games get a pass on some slow reactions if the movement animations convey momentum and weight. This one, and I stress this again, feels good.-	Awesome Visuals-	Feels good to play-	Play as different characters-	Nostalgia ticklerMost Buy for any Transformer Fan			",220,61,5,40,12,3,18

												Explosive 80's nostalga!I concider the War for Cybertron, and Fall of Cybertron to be the ultimate Transformers experience for anyone who was young and liked the cartoon and toys in the Gen 1 and Gen 2 days. The whole game just gives 110% the whole time letting you play awesome memorable Gen 1 Autobots and their Decepticon foes via the split singleplayer story. The game is a 3rd person corridor, and arena shooter that allows for use of the vehicle modes of the various charatcers (some driving, some flying) The music and voice acting are as good as I could imagine (Peter Cullen) and to top it all off you get really amazing high quality concept art that really accented my veiw of the game (the weapon concept art was the coolest). I played the game chapter by chapter casually over a few weeks, and by the end I had the main story done in 9 hours, so maybe shop this one on sale, or don't!  9/10 (nobody's perfect)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The graphics are very sharp, and stand up years later -- but you'd better get used to samey machanical corridors, with nice set pieces only scattered here and there.The voicework is excellent and involves many actors who've worked on the cartoon -- but the music is generic action movie droning, at best.The gameplay is tight, and it's nice to have access to a vehicle in a shooter like this at all times with your alt form -- but aside from that (and perhaps the ability to lug around turrets with your giant robot arms) there is nothing fresh here, even for 2010.I would recommend this game -- but only barely.  It treats the franchise well and the characters have their personalities fully intact and present some great banter from time to time.... so if you're a fan of the series you'll get more out of it, but even if you're not you should have an enjoyable enough time.  Just don't expect TOO much; it's basically a product riding on the combined successes of the first Bay Transformers film and Gears of War, that we were lucky got at least some TLC.

												This feels so much as a prequel to G1… Man, it’s awesome!I usually frown on redesigns of G1 transformers (like the ones of the movies and recent cartons) but these redesigns work. They work, look cool and feel right at home on the setting (Cybertron).Any keen eyed G1 fan knows that the Decepticons had a lot of lookalike jobbers, and that even the autobots had some on the first episodes. Well, this happens before that, so jobbers are expected but why are they so cool looking?In the end the game is a good shooter. I usually don’t like those types of games, but damn, this one feels good. I’m a real stickler to tight controls and responsiveness. But even so for me, games get a pass on some slow reactions if the movement animations convey momentum and weight. This one, and I stress this again, feels good.-	Awesome Visuals-	Feels good to play-	Play as different characters-	Nostalgia ticklerMost Buy for any Transformer Fan			",220,61,5,40,12,3,18

												A lot more fun than I thought it would be. Graphics aren't amazing (with it being an older game and all), but the transition from vehicle to bot or bot to vehicle was flawless, I was in awe at how good it looked.

												Overrated is all I can say. It's like Gears Of War with Transformers. The transform ability is a cool feature (and it looks cool as well), but you won't use it all that often. Besides transforming, you shoot. A lot. In fact, it's pretty much the only thing you'll do in this game. But I expected epic firefights (or battles) and they were nowhere to be found (in my opinion). Now I know the game takes place on Cybertron, so there isn't a whole lot of color, I get that. But after 8 hours of playtime I still have the feeling I've been walking around in circles. A little more variation couldn't have hurt this game. I just hope they'll use Earth, or any other planet with at least a bit of color for that matter, in their next game. And maybe add some cool driving segments. And flying segments. And bunnies. Fluffy bunnies. Yeah...[Rating: 77/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												War for Cybertron is to Transformers games, what Arkham Asylum is to Batman games. While Fall of Cybertron is a much better game in terms of gameplay, graphics, and audio, War for Cybertron is a fun game which will be an absolute thrill to Transformers fans, both young and old.Pros:+Voice acting is excellent. Although Frank Weller does not perform the voice of Megatron, the actor in this game does an excellent job of portraying the strongest Decepticon.+Lighting and color pallete are well suited to the games themes.+Gameplay is very smooth. You feel as though you actually are a transformer.+Multiplayer is excellently done (You can customize your own transformer!)+Story is well written. Both campaigns feel like an episode of transformers.+Subtle references to the Original series are made throughout the game.Cons:-30 Fps Cap. Not a huge deal, but for some this may be an annoyance.-MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD.-Some visual glitches can occur from time to time.-Soundwave transforms into a car.-Story can be somewhat short, depending on your skill level and the difficulty at which you play.-Graphics settings are a bit lacking. There are very few options.Overall, Transformers War for Cybertron is a game that any Transformers fan is sure to fall in love with.8/10			",100,17,6,10,20,0,12

												TL;DR - Yes, the shooting mechanics themselves are somewhat clunky, but it's still an effing TRANSFORMERS THIRD-PERSON SHOOTER, and it works!Of all the things in the gaming world, I would have never expected the successful fusion of the Transformers brand and a third-person shooter, yet, here we are. Somebody more articulate than I once said that “War for Cybertron” and its sequels were essentially the equivalent of the Batman Arkham games; both reinvent these franchises in the gaming world with gameplay systems that prove surprisingly effective in supporting the setting and characters. Granted, my (albeit limited) knowledge of Transformers doesn’t really include mowing down waves upon waves of nameless Cybertronians using one of three varieties of machine gun, but the core aesthetic of teamed-up, tough-talking transforming space robots is still present and strong. The shooting mechanics themselves are thankfully varied; in addition to the existence of a sizable arsenal, the ability to transform into a vehicle and grant yourself a completely different loadout (with its own reserve of ammo) ensures that you never really stop “going” through a level. A lot of the luster in the weaponry lies in the flashy pyrotechnics they produce; it may be an Unreal Engine 3 game, but it still is quite a looker by today’s standards. The game’s excellent pacing exists also in thanks to variability in level design; sure, the concept of the “action setpiece” is an often lambasted one, but the frequency at which War for Cybertron throws different ones at you is something to be admired, at least. That said, War for Cybertron is by no means a “Gears of War”-quality TPS; for all of the aftermentioned flashiness and particle effects, there lacks a certain gravity in how weapons effect enemies.  In other words: “bulletsponge” enemies, and a lot of them at that, especially in the late game. Also, the lack of a “hold to aim/zoom” toggle is annoying, but not as sizable a problem as the game’s biggest sin of incomplete controller support. Yes, the game is technically playable using a 360 controller, but good luck finding documentation of any kind on what actions the buttons are assigned to. I’ve also heard that certain vehicle sections are not mapped correctly, making the prospect of successfully using a controller unlikely, to say the least. Final words: In the end however, I think Transformers: War for Cybertron is definitely worth a play, because when all is said and done, it’s still a totally competent shooter. By itself, that’s not much of a feat, but when attached to the Transformers brand, of all properties, it totally freaking is.			",250,76,5,34,9,1,10

												I had very low expectations when I picked this up on sale, but it turned out to be incredibly entertaining (though unremarkable) third person shooter, doubly so if you are familiar with the Transformers. The gripe that I have with it is the rather poor PC port. It has a 30 FPS cap (which can be lifted quite easily with a third party trainer), and the controls in a flying vehicle, whether you prefer gamepad or M/K, are annoying at best.I highly recommend playing Megatron at least once during the campaign. It makes you understand why those Saturday morning villains keep pursuing their evil goals despite being thwarted time and time again by the do-gooders.			",81,4,1,6,2,0,5

												I strongly recommend this game because it has a lot of suspense and its very action-packed. The Transformers look like they have a lot more technology on them than the ones we usually see. It was a little hard at first, but if you get the hang of it, it will be very fun. This game is very much like Team Fortress 2, but it has a third person perspective, you don't unlock weapons, you find them on the battlefield while doing missions. They are like Team Fortress 2, like as Optimus, he can hold a minigun and a rocket launcher (you have to find it first).			",74,3,1,0,4,1,5

A game that explains and shows the origin of the transformers, Also reasons why Cybertronians had no choice but leave their planet migrating to our own.  This one georgous game and it's like eye and ear candy alover.  I highly recomend you to get this game.  Its worth your money Don't miss out.  On another positive note get this game and Fall of Cybertron, if you want a better multiplayer experence play as the transformers get the second game.  The multiplayer is more active than the War for Cybertron game.  + these games need more players so get these games now... pls   :-)			",66,4,2,5,1,0,0

												     As this game's name states, the Transformers go to war over who gets to control Cybertron, their home planet. I would only reccomend this game if you have watched Transformers before. If you haven't, it'll still be fun, but it'll be even better if you've seen Transformers before. This game has alot of Pros and Cons, so I'm just gonna hit the highlights.     Pros:1: A Great Shooter/Sci-Fi/Drama Game2: Has Good Graphics3: Has Long Levels With Checkpoints In Reasonable Areas     Cons:1: Gets Slow And Trippy If Played Too Long (Or That Might Just Be My Tablet)2: Only Has 10 Levels     You can review the reasons for buying or not buying I have listed here. And overall, I'm giving this game a Thumbs Up.			",7,2,2,1,0,0,1

												Somewhat clunky unmappable controls and a capped framerate of 30FPS does not seduce many a PC gamer.  You can unlock the framerate and remap the controls using available utilities.  You can also, through CCC, ""enhance"" application AA using Morphological Filtering.  Going in I had not one iota nor inkling about the Transformers universe though I hear this game is faithful to the subject matter.  My lack of knowledge wasn't to my detriment as the game does a fantastic job of indoctrinating the player about the universe surrounding Cybertron.  Graphic fidelity is top notch though being Unreal based the look of all of the levels tends to be homogenous (see my screens).  Transforming between gun a toting robot and  a vehicle is fun.  2 campaigns included.  Choice of Transformer at the start of each level (each with different abilities) is a bonus and a nice touch.  The plethora of  innovative weaponry is great as is the gunplay.  Great set pieces make for an AA title.			",2426,1048,114,292,316,28,430

												Transformers: War for Cybertron is an amazing 3rd person shooter which also tries to relate a part of the movie prequel. The game takes you at the very beginning of the story, when the War for Cybertron started between the Autobots and the Decepticons and gives you the chanse to experience how their war leaded to the destuction of Cybertron.The campaign is divided in two parts, first you get to play for Decepticons, and then for Autobots. Every new mission gives you the possibility to choose between three different characters, each of them having specific weapons / abilities and also the vehicle type they can be changed to. Co-op aka Escalation Mode is a great way to get some fun with your friends, as well as the Multiplayer Mode too, since even if four years passed from the release date - it is still pretty active.Great story, decent graphics, awesome gameplay and outstanding voice acting! It deserves a try for sure. So, customize your own transformer as fast as you can and get into the War for Cybertron before it gets too late!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Better than the Transformers moives. I had a lot of hours into this game back when i had it on the xbox 360 and it was just an all around great story. The best part was that it has co-op. If you love Transformers that give this game a shot.The only thing that im just a little bit upset about is that you do not get the dlc and the FPS is capped at 30. Unlocking the fps is easy, just look it up on google.9.5/10 ( [well worth playing, best story in a transformers game, fun co-op] {no dlc, fps is locked, not many people are playing as of 11-30-2015}			",81,3,6,7,2,0,0

Because game honestly and greatly sticks to its original plot, comics and generation 1 Transformers. With easliy enjoyable gameplay and ofcourse great multiplayer only glitch about the game is why the hell they canceled co-op option for the campaing?

												Something evil's watching over you, comin' from the sky above and there's nothing you can do!Prepare to strike! There'll be no place to run,w hen your caught within the grip of the evil UnicronTransformers... War for Cybertron is more than meets the eye...Transformers War for Cybertron has the usual Robots in disguise but also enough nostalgia to drown yourself in.The story is pretty good, and if you're a fan of the original cartoons then you'd surely enjoy this game. Voice acting, graphics, and music are also spot on. The controls can be a wee bit clumsy but not too much of a problem, and sometimes some of the environments can be a little bit claustrophobic however it goes with that particular setting. The game is fun, not overly hard but did feel a little bit short. Coop is fun with friends and replayable.All in all, I'd recomend this game to fans of Transformers, and to casual gamers. It's worth a buy at the current price but if curious then wait till its on sale. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Decent, good looking game.  It's fairly short and I can't see it having a ton of replay value but for fans of the series or the comics it's got a lot to like.  It has a lot to gripe about for your really committed fans both in terms of story and game mechanics but it still beats the pants off anything Michael Bay is going to shovel out.  And it still manages to blow up real good too.The voice acting is a high point and that's important--the only moderately disappointing spot here was the voice of Warpath sounded more like he was doing Hot Rod with a few ""whams"" and ""booms"" sprinkled into his speech.  The character models are all faithful to the Generation 1-leaning Cybertronian look of some of the newer toys and comics as well.  I know I said it was short but I can see the gameplay getting repetitive if it went on for a whole lot longer.  The transformation mechanic melds well with the overall feel of the gameplay and is fairly smooth and seamless.  While the weapons are a bit iffy, you'll figure out quickly which ones you want and which ones you pick up only if you have no other option.  It's unfortunate that there wasn't a bit more distinction in the guns, especially in the sense that both Megatron and Optimus Prime's weapons don't work much differently from the garden-variety peashooters you will usually leave behind.  Really, if there's one problem with this game it's that every character and every gun feels pretty much the same.  The only real difference in how they play is whether the character turns into a ground vehicle or a jet of some kind.  Of course, if you're enough of a fan to still be reading this, then the similarity really doesn't matter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I like the game overall it leaves a lot to be desired - first I love the aesthetics, the settings, the designs... well the look is awesome, the story is quite nice too considering it is Transformers and an action game.My complaints go more along the lines of gameplay - honestly playing with different characters isn´t... so different since aside from vehicle mode weaponry you will be pick weapons on stages. I´d prefer for all weapons to be fixed for the characters. The skills weren´t that helpful saving for things like energon wall or automated sentries. Same goes for the alt modes, they could be more distinctive gameplaywise.And that brings us to transforming and how it wasn´t that much involved - I saw myself transforming mostly to change weapons rather than actually have some better mobility save for very few situations or when the game forced me to.And last, as a female player I find that leaving the fembots out of the plot as prizes for completing campaigns really awkward, specially since the extra modes are online and plot less for which I don´t really care.Still the visuls, the setting and the plot compansate for the bad parts so still thumbs up :)			",472,88,28,90,22,3,55

												Bow down to the best game in the Transformers franchise.This game is so good, it's almost on point. Transformers: War for Cybertron is a FPS based on events that take place before Generation 1/Prime with a few strings pulled from here and there for creative flexibility. From the unique cybertronian designs to a beautifully set up storyline, High Moon did a fantastic job here. Might I say the character personalities are amazing, the portrayal of the individual Seekers' personality really made me happy and are just how I always interpreted them. Watching the transformation of Orion Pax to Optimus Prime. I really like this game and I love the campaign.Now for the disappointing half, I played this back on Xbox 360 when it first released. I got the DLC, some of which were characters like Shockwave and the map packs. Had a good time in multiplayer leveling up my character, no problem. Now I find out WFC is on PC. Fun, right? Wrong. Not only is this game missing patches but NONE of the DLC presented on he consoles are provided here. That's about 7ish characters we're missing out on for multiplayer? Speaking of multiplayer, don't try it. Firstly, it's just about always dead now. Secondly, the games are infested with cheaters. Infinite armor, FPS unlocker, rapid fire, etc. Does High Moon do anything about this? No. Will High Moon do anything about this? No. Do not set foot in a public game unless you want to lose because you're sure as hell not winning.High Moon Studios, what the ♥♥♥♥?Not only that but this game was abandonded as soon as it was dropped on Steam for their sequel game, Fall of Cybertron, WHICH IS JUST AS BROKEN AND CHAOTIC AS THIS GAME. High Moon Studios took priority over their console games rather than PC. Why wasn't there any DLC released for this game? I would have happily forked out for it but instead they left us in the dust just so they could rush on their next game and abandon it as well.I love High Moon Studios for this game, it is one of my all time favorites but the fact that there was no love or time taken to fix up and maintain the game on this platform severely disappoints me. If there was a in-between rating for games I would definately give it to this game. The only instance where I would recommend this game would only be for the campaign and escalation. Multiplayer has been ruined by a selfish community. I can only recommend the full experience of WFC on Xbox or PS3.			",196,49,2,21,27,2,12

												In case you are on the fence about this game:- Riding giant robot slugs- Cars doing ariel rolls- Pummeling decepticon punksIn all seriousness, the campaign ranges from dull to pretty awesome (robot slugs). The combat is okay, but being able to transform on the fly into a speedy vehicle just enhances the experience exponentially. I really mean it when I say I went into the multiplayer not expecting much and got a thrill that was entirely unique to this game. There is nothing like speeding off a ramp, flipping through enemy fire, landing behind the enemy, and finishing him off with a wack of your energon blade.Now that I've finished this one, I can't wait to start Fall of Cybertron.

												In case you are on the fence about this game:- Riding giant robot slugs- Cars doing ariel rolls- Pummeling decepticon punksIn all seriousness, the campaign ranges from dull to pretty awesome (robot slugs). The combat is okay, but being able to transform on the fly into a speedy vehicle just enhances the experience exponentially. I really mean it when I say I went into the multiplayer not expecting much and got a thrill that was entirely unique to this game. There is nothing like speeding off a ramp, flipping through enemy fire, landing behind the enemy, and finishing him off with a wack of your energon blade.Now that I've finished this one, I can't wait to start Fall of Cybertron.

												Already finished the console version of this game but at sale price on Steam couldn't resist wanting to see it on my PC as well.  Looks great but the port to PC is lacking in the controls department.  Though it can make use of my gamepad controller, it is mapped strangely compared to the console version and is painful compared to just M+K.  Shame about that since High Moon Studios has the most impressive version of the Transformers universe in gaming and I would otherwise recommend it. ",46,2,0,14,5,2,20

												Being a staunch fan of the original series, I had longed for a Transformers game that did justice to the original material and characters, and War for Cybertron mostly does the series proud.  There are several interesting things about the game.  First of all, it's basically a prequel to the series, which helps to explain how the Cybertronian wars started.  Secondly, you play half the game as the Decepticons, and the other half as the Autobots.  The characters are all animated well, you can transform as often as you want, and there is a wide range of favorite characters to choose from, including  Megatron and Soundwave on the Decepticon side, and Optimus Prime, Ironhide, and Ratchet on the Autobot side.  An interesting array of weapons, a real sense of outer space and Cybertron, and great boss battles with giants Omega Supreme and Trypticon help round it out, though there could be more variety in the minor enemies. Still, War for Cybertron is definitely the Transformers game to get.			",287,49,0,39,2,0,6

												This game is epic, if you like TPS (Third-Person-shooter) this is a good one for you. I like TPS and this is the best TPS i ever played. The campaign is is really good better then other games i played. It has great texture and detail and graphics but it doesn't matter about those, it just matter how good the game is. Its almost the same thing as Transformer Fall of Cybertronbut it doesn't have where you can change the torses and arms and stuff and some caracters look differant. But beside thatthe game is fun. I like how instead of only playing as autobots you get to play as decepitcons. Then i like the caracters tooand the weapons. One thing that doesn't make sense when a transformer dies... well they explode it doesn't make senseif you were a jet and you crash that makes sense. So instead of buying the $59 Transformer fall of cybertron you can buy this for $19.99 and its bit the same and wait till the prices go down. But sense TFOC is a new game alot of people play it. This game for me everyday there is about 7-20 players a day. Not many but it was worth my money its AWESOME :D.			",144,13,6,15,20,0,13

												THIS GAME IS TOTALLY RAD! This is quite simply the most impressive and action-packed game I've played since Crysis was released! Gameplay, visuals, music & sound are all top-notch...but it's the STORY that really sells it. Really feels like you're on Cybertron. The controls are VERY intuitive and easy to pick up, and plays much FASTER than its sequel ""Fall of Cybertron"" (which is also good, but in its own way). I personally enjoyed this one more than Fall of Cybertron, so definitely check it out. YOU WON'T REGRET THIS ONE. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the Transformers series, comics, movies and I've wanted to play the games for a while so I bought this one, the game itself is pretty decent, voice acting is decent heck even graphics aint to bad but the problem I have with the game is mainly the controls, I've looked all over for a way to dodge attacks but all I could find was a strafe left to right and I dont consider that dodging when most of the enemies projectiles follow you, and when in vehicle mode you move so slow, and if you use boosters you go so fast that a 1 inch movement with the mouse you spin 360 degrees (a tad over exaggerated but not to far from the truth) and there is no Mouse sensativity setting but there is a camera sensativity but it does not help the fast movement of the camera.But for 10 bucks, I'd say give it a try if you want but I cant play it doesn't mean you wont like it. My vote is: No to recommending this game for the camera situation, the dodging aspect doesnt bother me much.			",26,2,0,12,0,0,0

												As a childhood fan of Transformers, I was really looking forward to this game (finally found out about FOV adjustment through Flawless Widescreen to alleviate motion sickness I was having). Unfortunately, the monotony and blandness oF everything from the levels to the combat really leaves me unimpressed. I think the Transformers and Cybertron all look awesome, the voice acting is great; but I didn't buy beautiful artwork. I bought a game. And in this respect, I am disappointed with this game. Hopefully Platinum Games does a better job with Devastator (or whatever it ends up being called).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: December 2, 2015
This review is based on about the hour or so of gameplay I played during a $5 sale before returning the product. As such I am limited to what I experienced. Please keep this in mind!War for Cybertron was a game that I heard a lot of good things about. With it being Transformers (a series that I enjoyed quite a bit in my childhood, although not quite on the same level as my brother) I was excited to give it a try. What I got was less than desirable. While I initially was reluctant to review a product that I had such little time with, I felt it was important to share my feelings about the game to give others a better sense of what they should expect / recieve.The gameplay in this game is rather interesting. The fact that you can transform SEEMS like it would offer quite a bit of variation on combat. That's not quite true. Transforming merely seemed like another gun and a slightly altered means of transportation with flying, which is actually useful, and driving, which switches between sluggish or super sonic speed depending on your actions. This just feels clumsy and really serves more as a gimmick.Jumping is odd. You have a double jump, but most obstacles feel like you need to use both anyway. Not solid, but I can't say it was terrible.Camera controls. Ugh, I'm not a fan of them. Having an over the shoulder perspective is usually a hit or miss due to the fact that they often pick a side to stick with. This is USUALLY a bad design decision unless levels are built around that. This is a game that does that and isn't built for it. (At least as far as I could find control wise, correct me if I'm wrong.) Imagine hiding behind cover with a camera stuck on your right shoulder and an enemy attacking you. Due to the fact that he resides on the left side of the screen you are unable to attack him without coming out of cover.Which leads to my next complaint. Cover is pretty much nonexistent. Sure you can stand behind things, but this feels incredibly inadequate and often leads to the damage you take feeling cheap. With a small health bar and only medkits to replenish health, it seems odd that avoiding damage is so tricky. (While I might have been bad at this game and thus affecting my view on this, I will say that I don't always suck.)Ammo feels lacking. With most enemies taking at least half a magazine of bullets to finish off unless using a weapon with more sparse ammo (and thus being more deadly.) This means that the rigid car mode is something you'll find yourself stuck using to alleviate this problem.Making an account for Co-op and online play is actually incredibly easy and gets major applause for it. All it asks is for a name and your pretty much good to go. No hassle and I was done in ten seconds flat. (Although adding a friend seems to be a mutual process.)However the actual Co-op feels slapped on. Ammo and health had the biggest impact on this situation. The levels are designed to give enough for one player. When you add another robot providing support but using the same resources you start having someone (or even multiple) people in the party having to stay behind because they are out of something crucial. This could have easily been fixed by having the health and ammo work for both players, or just dropping duplicates of them.Not only that but you'll find that if your partner runs just a little bit ahead, most doors end up closing on the other(s) before they can make it through. Their solution is to simply toss the player left behind into the next room. This is very disorienting and really isn't a good solution. Still it does get the job done.The enviroment is definitely done well and really feels ""robotic"" and futuristic. The problem I have with it though is that enemies are too easily hidden and indistinguishable from the background. This might have just been a problem for me.The story is something I truly can't speak on. As I said at the start of this, I only had about an hour or so to experience it. What I did experience though in the story was lackluster. The only thing I remember was Megatron being an absolute meanace and everyone else basically saying, DARK ENERGON IS DANGEROUS! It hit me over the head again and again, and was simply too straight foward for me to care about. Now Transformers is based on a pretty young demographic and isn't really known for deep and complex story. Still, I would have wagered that a more ""mature"" artstyle would mean trusting the player a little bit more on following the story.Unfortunately I didn't get to try my hand on the multiplayer. I suppose it's possible that a lot of the fun to be had here is in this mode, but we are also talking about a game that's quite a few years old. While you might be able to round some people up, servers are going to be lacking a strong player base.The game just feels lacking, and while some fanatics of Transformers might really enjoy this game, it just doesn't stand on its own AS a game. Still, others clearly seem to have found some fun playing it. At $5 on sale most people won't care about these problems or might find it more enjoyable than I did. For me, it just wasn't enough. Overall I rate the game about a 4/10. A below average game for me that I sadly can not recommend.			",405,53,8,29,20,3,45

												The fighting is unaspring though the some of levels design and artwork is great.Transformers will probably satisfy the fans of the cartoon/comic but not worth the investment if you are not. The game can get repetitive as you travel from point A to point B to a boss. The several weapons to choose from are ho hum and limited ammo can be an annoyance. The characters are visually cool, though not that fundamentally different from each other. Their are some sublte differences as you can play as a healer or scout. Transformation from vehicle and robot doesn't provide a great deal of strategic advantage aside from being able to manuever better and looking cooler. And the special abilites once again are cool though not very exciting.  As and old game, the multiplayer is non existant. I would probably tell average games to stay away, and only the hardcore fans apply.			",7,0,0,1,1,0,2

												Despite the 2010 year graphics this is still a enjoyable game ! Much action, nice level design, awesome sound !The camera is of course awful like all console ports and the textures can become tiresome and too much busy in gray colors.

												This game started out great, you get to play as the decepticons and enjoy Megatrons pleasant supportive quips, fast forward to the autobots with their lame lines and awesome metal soundtrack, I thought it couldnt get any better when Optimus told me to ride into battle with him on a slug. I was like F*yeah, but it came to an end when fighting Tripticon for the third time and thats when the boss starts to have an autistic fit. To win that fight you might as well win the lottery its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I gave up after a dozen tries. BTW the control layout is crap, you might want to change that.I returned the next day and downed Trypticon the first try, the ending credits song is awesome! the game is beautiful but the lack of weapon and ability diversity hurts the replay ability.

												I like Transformers, the comics (Marvel and IDW) and the G1 cartoons though not the Bay films. This just doesn't do it for me, the game play is boring and your AI cohorts are next to useless unless you give them an age and then they might kill some enemies for you. You hit artifical barries all too often in (flying) vehical mode and the decepticon jets being able to only hover for a short time as a robot is an odd choice.Graphically and sonically its pretty great. The voice work and loosely the story is the sole reason I am going to finish this game.			",404,194,6,65,50,8,84

												Way too glitchy when lots of enemies are around.  I'm talking about single player mode. Plays like an Early Access Game.  First off, in many cases enemy flyers will position themselve just above a bridge in robot form and shoot down THROUGH THE BRIDGE and I can't shoot back.  Another case, with the gernade launcher at hand at a basic enemy vehicle  I would fire 2 or 3 shots and detonate them all at once yet i'm the only one that gets effected by it because I'm too close to it.  Bottom line, my shots don't register sometimes to the enemy but I have no problem receiving fire from the enemy			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I actually regret buying this game.... Not as good as it looked I thought and you CANNOT change the keys!!Loaded the game and I could not change the keys AT ALL to play, what sort of game is that?Graphics: The graphics are the same as other Transformers game, bland and boring....Audio: The audio is transformers with weird voice overs to me, they do not sound the same and shooting sounds very weird.Controls: What controls, you cannot change them and are forced to use the ones they give you, too me I cannot use the keys they assigned me.Game: I honestly cannot say how I feel about the game because I did not play enough to say it was good, the controls above really put me off so I stopped playing it after a few minutes, but within those few minutes I did not like the game at all, so for that I removed and never played the game again.Would I recommend the game? No!			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

												A boring slog through grey corridors, shooting the same robots over and over. Character- and level-designs are confusing and too similar, there's nothing worth collecting, there's no leveling or upgrades... This is one of the most phoned-in games I've played, and I was bored the entire time, even on 'Hard'.If I'm playing as a 50-foot tall robot, I want to feel like I'm a heavy, creaking machine, but I might as well be playing a slower Gears of War. There's no dodge, no cover mechanic, a quarter of all battles are spent trying to discern the enemies from the environment, and transforming is reduced to little more than a third weapon. Having closed the game, I'm failing to find a reason to open it again.The voice acting is fine though.			",406,133,1,54,29,4,58

												Imagine that a cable science-fiction channel had an unexpected gap to fill in its programming and for contractual reasons with its advertisers the content had to be something new rather than a re-run. They tell their youngest unpaid interns about this at 5 o'clock as they're packing up to leave, saying it had better be ready to air by the next morning. Already exhausted from a mid-week birthday party that lasted well into the previous night, and having never done anything like this before, the interns must write, direct, act, and produce their own made-for-TV-movie in just a few hours.That's exactly how Transformers: War for Cybertron must've been created.The graphics and gameplay are just Unreal Tournament skinned with a few tweaks. Inaccurate, unpowerful weapons. Dull, blurry textures. Locked in third-person mode. Extremely slow movement speed even when things are supposed to be rushed. Collecting glowing shards from defeated enemies that do absolutely nothing. All the changes make things worse, and UT did not have a strong single player campaign to begin with.The dialogue and voice acting are so bad as to be laughable if only the game didn't take itself so seriously. The story and some of its moments just shatter any suspension of disbelief. This is a problem with Transformers in general (why in the world would a group of alien machines transform into exact replicas of vehicles meant to transport humans when they've never seen any before (this is a prequel after all)? Or for that matter, why do they even have two arms, two legs, and faces? Those things are utterly irrelevant to a machine's existence) but this game exacerbates them. Oh there's a hard terminal to hack? The solution is to reduce the power being sent to it. Because a computer's incoming power affects its security. Idiotic doesn't even begin to describe it.The one saving grace is the boss fights. Some of them are a fun diversion for a few moments. And they're consistently the only parts of the game that can't be ignored and just sprinted through. But they are the vast minority of where your time will be spent during a play through.I bought this game to play co-op, but it's honestly one of the only games where I can't imagine co-op making it better. Maybe you'd be able to make fun of it with your partner in real time. What a silver lining that would be. ",204,75,1,29,4,2,23

												Utter pile of garbage,  Fluffy vague unsatisfying combat.   Was bored playing it.  And the final straw was when it set me back to the start of a long slog of a level from the level boss after dying, because a misclick on ""Restart Chapter""  rather than the restart from last checkpoint (The button right next to it)  needed no Confirmation.  Just bang back to the start of the level.     Only reason I kept playing was for the amusingly Hammy voice acting.   And that wasn't enough anymore after that last insult.			",81,4,0,6,3,0,4

 Couldnt find players in multiplayer.  So I cant really review that but I would have loved to. The singleplayer was kind of boring.  I liked the story but I was bored to tears when I played the first Decepticon mission. I expected that the levels would be a little more open and have optional areas for you to quickly drive around to get behind the enemies. But instead I was treated to boring third person shooter with some pretty standard level design. From what I saw they failed to fully take advantage of what made the game special and it lost my interest very quickly.The story is awesome, and I would have totally finished it if I had a friend to play with.  However it feels like there is a huge lack of freedom in any of the levels and its just boring to play through alone.			",272,37,5,11,13,5,15

												I really wanted to say some great stuff about this game and I can really see the appeal for the right type, gameplay is fluid and the ambient sounds are perfectly cybertronian. THe model ideas for the charachters look great and im sure id see much more of that good stuff if I were to keep playing, but I wont... nor will I play the sequel I bought. Clearly some love was put into the production and it was fairly well recieved for a reason. However, personally all im finding is a headlong run and gun with no real strategy or AI intelligence to challenge me. The envornment and graphics are all pretty n stuff but truthfully are more distracting than awe inspiring for me and make it more of a challenge to decipher the level design than the actual gameplay. I know im being too critical, perhaps its just not my gamestyle, I just think its too hard to see the smarts past all the shiny. Meh.Maybe ill try it again another time but I cant reccomend it so far.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Been a Transformer fan since 1984 and I appreciate that the devs who made this game clearly are as well! The crazy thing is why did it actually take this long to create a game actually based on true Transformers canon? The game  takes place on Cybertron and its never looked better!! War For Cybertron features a lengthy campaign for both the Autobots and Decepticons, co op mode, multiplayer deathmatch, and excellent third person shooting.

												A great idea, and stunningly well designed, thought out game. The graphics are fantastic, the sound and voice acting a actually pretty surprisingly good... all around, it's a great game.But...The game is so agonizingly linear that it tends to ruin the rest of it. There are many, many places that are stunningly beautiful and complex, which could have made wonderful places to creep through and explore, but end up simply being a hallway with cutscenes and gunfights. Sections of the game that would have been perfectly set up to allow for multiple paths and player creativity are left with un-passable, knee-high walls to keep you on a single platform until the story decides to let you move on.The vaunted ability to unlock more transformer chassis (in truth, there are only two, and it is the only way in the game to get a female transformer) and build your own character is woefully basic; effectively a choice of an existing character with a PARTIALLY different paint job built from a VERY limited color pallete selection. The custom characters are also ONLY available if you play multiplayer against other people, which is also the only way to level up and unlock new equipment and abilities (of which there tend to be may 2 at best for any given character type).despite actually liking the game, it is so basic and bland that I couldn't stomach putting in the effort to finish it. I'll use the hard drive space for a game that doesnt drag me along by the wrist.			",210,59,0,83,12,1,35

												Personal Rating: 4 of 10If you enjoy a linear 3rd Person Shooter, this game might be the one for you. Overall the graphics, sound, voice acting, guns selection, controls, A.I. and story are alright. There are little things in the game that might surprise you. However going into the second chapter of the mission you already seen everything the game has to offer even the story. Don't expect any plots because they are predictable and minimal.You get to choose 1 out of 3 bots to play each chapter while the other two will keep you company. They are not entirely useless since they can distract and kill enemies. The environment are well designed and gives you a good feeling of the bots' home planet but maps are linear. You move from one area to another fighting swarms of bots. Clearing them will allow you to loot and restock your health and ammo. Rinse and repeat.Bots have melee attack which looks cool but practically useless since you will take loads of damage charging into combat. Each bots have unique skills but in my opinion it should be a standard issue across all bots such as dashing, hovering and etc. They also have unique weapons but nothing that really stands out from what you can picked up during your play. You cannot modify weapons or enhance it. Whats worse is you can only hold 2 weapons schematic at a time. Why schematic? Because instead of wielding the weapon, your arm transform into the weapon which is pretty cool. Most weapons uses the same ammo/energy cell so it really not necessary to limit weapons. Also, certain bots has unique weapons that can heal teammate. This is cool if your A.I. teammate can actually take damage. You cannot drop certain primary weapon so you end up only holding a single useful offensive weapon.Weapons feels solid when firing with the effects and all but falls short when hitting the enemies because no matter how much impact you feel it should hit, the enemies does not dismember and the laws of physics does not really apply here. Most of the time they simply fell to the ground.Conversation between bots can be hilarious but gets old really fast as they keep on repeating them from time to time. The second mission was the coolest in my opinion since you get to fly. But to my dismay you only get to play it once out of 6 chapters from the Decepticons and to my assumption will be similar with the Autobots. Also the map is pretty enclosed so no open space battle which is a waste.The final boss fight from the Decepticon is designed like the old school games which is challenging and some skills with quick reaction is required. But the logic behind it is hilariously insulting.This game has great potential and it tapped in correctly it can be great fun. I never completed the game because moving on to the Autobots campaign, everything seems to be the same.			",1029,415,36,151,105,7,188

												as everyone knows transformers was a popular radio show from 1782 about billy a young boy who finds himself going through pubity and playing with his willy alot and, as the title suggests, transforming into a girl. this game does not portray this how ever as billy has instead been replaced by a planet named cyber-sex, a metaphore for his pubes and the robots that enhabit it represent lice causing pain...the campaign is split into 2 games... with no dlc surprisingly, if you wanna man up and not be a wimp play the de-contriception-ma-trons and skip the first 4 chapters for some reason, or you can be a wimp and play the non manual botsgameplay is weak just shoot nothing big like turning into a car for some reason but is still fun... its no garfield 2 but its worth checking out because billys mom is fit 4/10 would play again			",256,32,1,20,14,4,11

												This game is abit odd, for one it has these things called TRANSformers??? and they are like robots that turn into metal moving vehicle things? IDEK? This really shows Trans people getting involved in our ever expanding PC culture.? Ugh when will it stop? so apparently these robot things hate each other and fight for some reason or another(♥♥♥♥ knows why). Shouldnt trans people be united? I digress, the graphics are ok? but a little dated, the fps is a whopping 30 ♥♥♥♥ING FRAMES PER SECOND!!!. no way of changing it:))))))))) gameplay is fun aha. recomended if u dont mind seeing the most laggy thing in the land. the characters are pretty good, you have bad trans people and good trans people fighting for sommit? trans peace? who knows its trans people, am i right? Anyways6/10, love it or hate it (like trans people:))))) but yeah the 30 fps is like the most cancerous thing next to pro life.... .just kill it while u can bin it i say.			",89,3,1,11,2,1,5

												Not a Likely Choice Unless it is on Sale!the game is basically dead.average people who are online is around 30 players.those 30 players are people who don't know anything about the game, or people who have been playing the game so long they know every exploit to kill you in multiplayer.now I do admit the $20 or so dollars I spent to the game ""was"" worth that cost.the Campaing is both Autobots and Decipticons, being able to play your favorite characters.by yourself or with your friends.the Multiplayer would be fun if it had more people.everyone who plays it again, knows every exploit to kill you.but the overall customization is amazing, choose you robot, and paint him how you like for each different class, there is 4 different classes for each category of transformer. Scout, Scientist, leader, Soldier. being able to choose different weapons depending on your class. plus an added in ""Prime Mode"" so when you do reach level 25 for each category. you can reset everything and start over.Escalation is fun, I mean mind Blowingly Amazing!but if your a beginner its going to be hard depending how fast you learn.Escalation I would say is best played with friends. sadly Escalation can get boring because you only have 2 maps to play on. Escalation is a wave based gamemode, depending on the map. fight your way through waves of decipticons as you play as your favorite autobot, or fight your way through waves of autobots and your favorite decipticon. The game I'd say is worth around $5 to $10 and not a peny more. a dying game, only worth playing with friends or the campaign. other than that the game has no way of competing or going on farther to 2016.

(helmets) im a big fan of transformers, but i dont like this one. i almost have every game in the franchise. almost. i dont have fall of cybertron, and rise of the dark spark. all of the other games i played and enjoyed. maybe for someone this is a great game, but i just dont like it. and im not saying that you should not play the game. if you really really love the cube lookin transformers, (and every other thing in the game)  then, buy this game. to me mltiplayer is like in call of duty. everyone plays multiplayer on those games. butwhy isnt anyone playing multiplayer on this game!?!?

												I was heavily dissappointed by the experience of this game. It's rather glitchy and feels like almost no love was put into this title. The acting is okayish, the graphics could use alot of touching up, and the story was crappy. I am sad I wasted my money on this title when it promised so much. It does manage to deliver on most of them but not in the way most people would imagine they would be. If you REALLY like transformers, you may find yourself dissappointed by this mediocre treatment. If you want this for the gameplay, it's pretty mediocre there as well. This game is mediocre in general and they could have done better.			",214,64,4,32,52,2,35

												Poor, lazy PC port!!!  30 FPS cap without using a hack, cannot configure controls, non-existant tutorial (they just put some text in the pause menu and tell you to read it), mouse sensitivity changes between robot and vehicle mode, making it so that you can barely turn when in vehicle mode, and while a controller does work with it, it doesn't even tell you what buttons to use for each function.  Lazy, lazy, lazy port that PC gamers shouldn't have to put up with.  Only worth it if you get the game on sale for $5.  Don't reward the lazy devs by paying more than that.			",429,96,17,64,45,4,148

												As much as I love Transformers, this one triggered my claustrophobia. Very few games have the same thing that make you feel like you are suffocating, can't see anything, can't focus on anything. Everything is on top of each other and the whole game is set on a maze that you can never find the exit. The colors are overly desaturated and gloomy, characters look weird. I'd still prefer the TS: The Game which came out in 2007. I can't really comment on anything other than the gloomy visuals, calustrophobic level design and color palette.			",55,6,4,9,9,1,8

												Pretty much exactly what you'd expect. A lot of fun, but very short (ten missions, five per faction), and not much replayability factor. You play each mission on a squad of three characters, and have the option to play as any one of them at the start of each level, but the abilities and weapons aren't very diverse or personal, so there's not a lot of incentive to replay with different choices. Though the gameplay stays fun throughout, the increased difficulty of some of the later levels makes it feel at times like an OTS bullet-hell. Also, unless you have a friend (or friends) who also plays, virtually no multiplayer value. If you're a fan of the franchise, especially the original cartoon and toys, and the trailer excites you, you probably won't regret spending 20 bucks on it. For everyone else, catch this one on sale for a very fun, fast-paced, plug and play 5-10 hours.			",55,9,1,10,1,0,0

												It's hard to rate this game. On one hand, you got a really juicy setting, with the Autobots on one side, the Decepticons on the other, and Cybertron with nifty feature as the frame. The combat system is cool, though it takes some getting used to, and there's more to it than simply blasting away and hoping for the best. The story is also quite neat, since it fills in a lot of the blanks left by the cartoons (do note, it has nothing to do with the movies). On the other hand however, the single player part is incredibly short. It took me a combined 8 hours to complete this game, which is low, even by my standards. That basically leaves multiplayer, and to be fair, not many people bothered with it when it shipped. That said, I don't regret buying the game, because when you get down to it, I had one freaking space-machine-transformer-with-huge-laser-canons-kicking-mother-f***ing♥♥♥♥♥blast of a time during those 8 hours.

												The problems with previous renditions of Transformers games were probably due to time constraints and goals of quick cash ins. Fortunately, War for Cybertron transcends these limitations as it's neither based off a movie nor a rushed product hoping to ride the wave of passing trends. This particular game outshines the rest. First off, the story is original and different from what we've become accustomed to. Humans are out of the equation and this game focuses on the start of the schism that separated the infamous race of robots. Even better than the campaign though is the multiplayer. The online plays a lot like Call of Duty in that your weapons are customizable and you are rewarded with killstreak bonuses. The cherry on top though, is that you can transform from robot to vehicle any time you want. Needless to say, it's a blast and a must play for fans of third person shooters and the series alike.Grade: B+			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												Let me start out by saying huge transformers fan. I feel this game does great justice to the old school 80's cartoons as well as adding a bit to the lore. The graphics are good most systems of today can probably play all settings on extra. Plays a little like gears of war and cod with the mix of the transforming that happens. Great story line and single player campian as well. For a transformers fan a must have. For a fps fan worth checking out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Certainly a game worth its money, i originally rated this game 10/10 about a year ago due to the game play and most aspects about the game fairly impressive. I am an avid transformers fan but was a little disappointed with the quality interms of graphics, they seem to be a bit ropey and a bit more detail would have been better. Other than that i enjoyed online and the campaign modes.			",63,2,0,4,1,1,1

												Transformers is one of the greatest properties to come out of the 1980's, and War for Cybertron is a glorius tribute to that. If your a fan of Transfomers then this game would equal a blow job from Jenna Jameson fror 80s and 90s porn fans, myself included. If you love Transformers, if you like Transfomers , if you lik someone who has mentioned Transformers then you must play this game immediately! And if you don't like Transformers you can go ♥♥♥♥ yourself! wahy are reading this review anyway?			",477,41,10,59,26,3,47

												Screw the stupid movies. Thats my attitude and this games doesnt even acknowledge them.  I loved it.  Frankly I didn't have any major glitch issues.  I don't remember having any (people are complaining it has them).  If you were a fan of the cartoon and can deal with a few cartoon/game discrepencies then you will love this game.  Up to 3 player co-op.  Unfortunately, as awesome as the scenery is and as epic as the levels are there just is no significant replayability.  Its worth up to 20 bucks if you dont mind playing it through maybe twice. (I think its like 9 hours).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got this on sale and have not regretted a second. The environments and graphics are a little generic and samey throughout the campaign (and kinda jacked with my eyes after playing awhile), but the combat and weapons are satisfying and the coop is sublime. The only way to describe the combat in this is bat**** crazy. The juggling between vehicle and combat mode is perfect, allowing transformation at any time you see fit. The moment when I discovered this game was special was when I propelled starscream at a target, transformed into bot mode and slammed my enemies a$$ down mid-transformation... wow.

												Despite plainly showing it's card as a no frills console port (key mapping? nahhhh), this game is still a ton of fun. A few of the boss battles are more endurance tests than anything else, but the general gameplay is well balanced. Vehicle control is a little clunky as when you use ""boost"" mode all steering solely done by the mouse... problem is you pretty much ALWAYS use boost mode whilst a vehicle as the default speed makes Driving Miss Daisy look like Rush.One last negative, I gave up trying to get this looking acceptable in 3dvision...there is no Nvidia profile and no ""Helix"" community hotfix either. Pity, the flying levels in particular would be trippy as hell in 3D.			",348,129,5,34,18,2,23

												A solid third person shooter.  The single player campaign is great fun.  It's packed with references for fans of the old cartoon show and the 1980's animated movie.   On the downside, it is a very lazy console port and is lacking a lot of features.  Don't even bother with the multiplayer mode.  If you're a Transformers fan, though, it's worth picking up.

												From a purely game mechanic perspective, this really isn't anything special; it's arguably sub-par. Unlike Binary Domain or Spec Ops, the title doesn't hold a compelling storyline that excuses the mediocre game mechanics. Hell, those titles at least had some differences in game mechanics that distanced them from typical titles of their respective genres. WFC gives you the ability to transform into vehicles, which really doesn't amount to anything more than a quicker way to traverse the landscape and a third in-game weapon. They really missed an opportunity here; it was somewhat explored in a few segments where you could drive through the landscape as it was engulfed in war, but otherwise it's really the biggest let-down of the game.So why am I recommending this; am I a Transformers fan? Nah, I've never watched it and have stayed away from the recent movies. I came into this a Transformers virgin (har har har). I guess this TRANSFORMED me into a, you know, non-virgin or something (HAHAHAHAHAHAH)I'm recommending this for the same reason I recommended Spec Ops and Binary Domain: interesting storyline. The story on this number is nowhere near the levels that BD and SO touched upon, but just because a plotline isn't ''deep'' doesn't mean it isn't interesting. WFC feels episodic; each chapter is introduced with a ''last time on Dragon Ball Z'' type of summary, and it all feels like a season of the show, like you're watching a cartoon and want to tune in to the next episode. Having no prior knowledge of the series, I feel that it does a good job of introducing newbies to the franchise and doesn't overwhelm you with the franchise's giant mythos. They also did this cool thing whereby you first play as the evil side before switching to the good in the aftermath of evil's victory. It's a really nice touch. The plotline is still simplistic, but the feel I got from it gave me a cozy saturday morning vibe that I thoroughly enjoyed. I didn't play it so much for the game mechanics, but to see how the Decepticons would strike back, or how the autobots would regroup.Perhaps I'm a sucker for storylines because I feel like I should stop recommending titles just on that alone. But just as before I'll use the same logic: nothing is inherently flawed with the game mechanics, and the plot is what keeps you reeled in. The game is somewhat easy; I played on hard mode in co-op (two players, there's an option for three) and it was still a breeze, save for a few battles here and there. There's a multiplayer mode, but everyime I boot up the title and go online to host a game for me and the broski the in-game menu tells me that there are around 40 players online, so it's dead. This game recommendation hinges on you enjoying a simplistic plotline that plays out like a saturday morning cartoon, or perhaps if you're into the series. Cause it does the series justice (according to a different review, at least) and when it comes to cash cow franchises you really can't expect a decent video game, but here it is. If I were to place a numerical score on this, I'd saaaayyy....6/10; it's alright, but pretty fun in co-op (like all games, really). That's what probably made this really anjoyable for me, but objectively I'd give it a 6.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Perhaps a short and simple campaign (took me 19 hrs to complete the campaign, so it's not that bad) but it's just damn right fun :D Yeah it's linear. Yeah it may been seen as a bit of a mindless shooter, but you know what? It does all of those things really well. It's exciting from start to finish and yet it just keeps getting more and more epic as you reach the later levels. The inclusion of all of the different, classic, transformers is simply fantastic, they did a really good job of re-creating our old heroes (and villians), breathing new life into them whilst maintaining their original image along with A+ voice acting that just keeps you constantly immersed and hooked in. Also they got the perfect balance between making a serious and sad setting but at the same time making characters loveable, banter-y and entertaining. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, so I don't know what to say about it to be honest :P  Have fun! :D			",96,16,0,14,12,0,10

I dont know much about Transformers besides the 3 films, but i enjoyed the game. Story was kinda generic but it had alot of epic, fun set piece moments. Gameplay takes a bit to get into but it becomes a solid 3rd person shooter, with some annoying random difficulty spikes. Game looked fantastic, even if for most of the game, it all looks very similar. Overall, 7/10. If its on sale, I'd reccomend it.

Yes, the environments, cool as they are, could use a little more variety, but let's face it, the planet IS just one big hunk of mechanisims.I've not had a chance to play much of the multiplayer modes or campaign co-op, but I imagine that they could be lot's of fun if you've got some friends.If you're not a transformers fan, today's deal is at least worth a look. If you ARE a transformers fan, from what I hear this is the first Transformers game that was ever done RIGHT, so it's probably a game for you.			",185,45,1,25,8,4,27

												One of the most fun Transformer games I've ever played!  While the single (or co-op) campaign lets you use one of three quite iconic Decepticons or Autobots for specific missions, it is the multiplayer where you get the most options.  Not only do you get to choose what your alternate mode looks like, but also independant head, arms, legs, loadout and special ability, with each class having its own strengths and weaknesses			",98,44,0,35,48,3,56

												It's just as I remember from when I first played it on the 360...but... There's no achievement system. All the elements are there; the shootable icons, the hidden things, all of that. But it's like they left off the achievement system for some reason. All the framework is there; they just didn't finish it off for this version.So in that, I'm a little disappointed because all there is now is just the great story campaign, and a kind of decent MP. But there's no reward for doing ANYTHING. You just... play. I'll stil play it, but I have no motivation to try to get all the 'good stuff' or do harder modes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												War for Cybertron has a pretty damn cool aesthetic that incorporates just enough of the 'busy' movie transformer designs to make classic-style characters unique.  The gameplay itself is your typical run-and-gun shooter, with the addition of added 'classes' that get unique special abilities.  The single-player campaign can be a bit repetitive, but there are a number of nice set piece battles and the production values and liberal voice work make for a pretty fun 6-8 hours.

Possui Gráficos muito bons e uma jogabilidade rápida e simples. o Segredo da diversão está na possibilidade de se jogar todo o modo Campaign ou escalation (sobrevivência) em parceria de até + 2 amigos , apenas o multiplayer deixa a desejar , devido a ausência de servidores dedicados mas nada que Atrapalhe a diversão.Quem curtiu o jogo e ficou com um certo gostinho de quero mais , foi anunciada uma sequencia de War of Cybertron para 2012.

												A competent third person shooter with the added excitement of transforming mid-battle. I rather enjoyed the boss battles in the story, and the co-op mode is a great inclusion. If you enjoy Transformers lore, then that is an added bonus because this franchise is respectful to and expands upon the source material (unlike the movies).			",110,5,0,6,2,0,2

												I really wasn't expecting much from this game when I picked it up from the Steam sale other than some cool CGI cutcenes and hopefully a half decent story. I'm shocked how good this game is, it has excellent 3rd person singleplayer campaign that can be played co-op and also a decent and alive mulptiplayer community. The story and voice acting is spot on and it it really captures the dark feel of Transformers none of that Michael Bay ****.Anyway I have a long list of supposedly AAA title games on my games list that I don't even play...I can honestly say this one of the best on them.

												It's hard to rate this game. On one hand, you got a really juicy setting, with the Autobots on one side, the Decepticons on the other, and Cybertron with nifty feature as the frame. The combat system is cool, though it takes some getting used to, and there's more to it than simply blasting away and hoping for the best. The story is also quite neat, since it fills in a lot of the blanks left by the cartoons (do note, it has nothing to do with the movies). On the other hand however, the single player part is incredibly short. It took me a combined 8 hours to complete this game, which is low, even by my standards. That basically leaves multiplayer, and to be fair, not many people bothered with it when it shipped. That said, I don't regret buying the game, because when you get down to it, I had one freaking space-machine-transformer-with-huge-laser-canons-kicking-mother-f***ing♥♥♥♥♥blast of a time during those 8 hours.

It bring all the aspects of the movies and cartoons that we all grew up with. The gameplay and fighting is so fun it will get you saying ""Ohhh that was sweet!"". The overall game is amazing and very hard to put down. There's co-op were people can join your game at anytime through the singleplayer campaign. It has multiplayer were mostly people play Team Deathmatch which is very active still. There is leveling for your Multiplayer character. There are 4 classes to choose from in online. You can choose to be who you want in Singleplayer. The graphics are amazing and there is so much on screen that I cam in ""ah"" as to how beautiful it was all laid out. The voice acting is awesome and sounds exactly like the voice from the movies. Use a Xbox 360 controller to play this game because It felt more natural doing so. This is a must have game if you are into Transformers. I loved it!			",3034,1132,139,314,429,33,476

												You might think this is just another of the Transformers series games that just can't be a good game. Well then you might start thinking twice, you ask why ?well I will tell you, its because this game is amazing.I have never seen such an amazing gameplay within the games that you play as a robot, most of the games are just not good enough ( like the previous transformers games, Lost planet and many more ). Transformers : War For Cyberton offers a great single player which you can play in the coop mode with more two friends of yours also it offers an amazing multiplayer which in my taste never gets bored. the storyline will be intresting for those who like the Transformers series and the graphics are great but what really impressed me was the gameplay. I might even say that this game is one of the best third person shotter i have ever played. This game is worth the money you pay for it ( unlike most of the games today )			",447,83,8,41,16,5,50

												This game is true to delivering action packed scenes of our favorite robot race, the Transformers! It's visuals look great, combat is somewhat hard at times but overall it's very satisfing to transform into a plane/tank/car and shoot other transformers to bits. My main concern is with the targeting and distuction of enemys, sometimes it's hard to see from where they are shooting and where to best take cover because even if you play as out favorite villain Megatron you can still get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by low-ranked autobots. My review for this game: 8.5/10, it's difficult combat and bad cover system is easily weighted up by it's action packed scenes  and the transforming into vehicle-mode and firing everything. This game is great for both fans and non-fans alike, so pick this game up, transform and roll out!			",73,6,0,7,3,0,11

												Transformers War for Cybertron is a fun 3rd person shooter with lots of variety.The environments can be distracting but thats only because of it's cybertron style which i suppose fits.The weapons and abilites are interesting and unique. The characters hardly differ from one another but at the end of the day you're going to be choosing your own personal favourite transformer.The campaign is very fun to play, on your own or in co-op. But the fun in this game comes souly from the Multiplayer. Whether you're fending off hordes of robots with your buddies in escalation mode or your having an all out brawl against a rival team competivley, you'll get hours and hours of enjoyment out of this game.75/100			",68,10,2,4,7,0,3

												You might think this is just another of the Transformers series games that just can't be a good game. Well then you might start thinking twice, you ask why ?well I will tell you, its because this game is amazing.I have never seen such an amazing gameplay within the games that you play as a robot, most of the games are just not good enough ( like the previous transformers games, Lost planet and many more ). Transformers : War For Cyberton offers a great single player which you can play in the coop mode with more two friends of yours also it offers an amazing multiplayer which in my taste never gets bored. the storyline will be intresting for those who like the Transformers series and the graphics are great but what really impressed me was the gameplay. I might even say that this game is one of the best third person shotter i have ever played. This game is worth the money you pay for it ( unlike most of the games today )			",447,83,8,41,16,5,50

												This is truly a 'non-stop action' game. Both campaigns are fun and unique. The pacing between vehicle, on-foot and boss combat is excellent. The multiplayer is surprisingly strong: customization and unlock progression seem deep. Very few people in matchmaking, unfortunately.			",247,65,5,32,20,2,30

												This port is not as bad as people say. Yes, you can't change the controls, but they are sufficient controls as is. You can use a mouse since you are on PC, therefore, you will have a much easier time aiming. Especially useful if you play a Scout (can start with a sniper rifle.)The graphics are better on PC. This is a bit of a dated game, but the textures are really all that need some improvement.The story is very tailored to 3-person co-op, but is okay for a Transformers game...let's be realistic here, Transformers is not about a good story. I love the tone, though.Co-op is extremely fun, btw, but...***MULTIPLAYER! In no other game can I do the kind of stuff that I do in War for Cybertron! Play a car, sharp turn around a corner, kill someone with your car guns, transform, still moving forward from the momentum, shoot people while transforming, jump, smack someone in the air, come back down, probably still sliding,  switch weapons and snipe someone, turn invisible, pick up someones dropped minigun -- you can steal other classes weapons -- use a minigun while cloaked. All in the span of about 15 to 40 seconds if you're good!!! There are few other games that I can think of where you can so fluidly combine what you're doing. Super Mario Brothers 64 sorta does, but that's single-player on a console.***No*** other game I have ever played has multiplayer as frenetic as this. I can't keep up 50% to 70% of the time. UT2004 wishes it came close.True, the matchmaking could be a bit better, there isn't the best player base in the world, you need to make sure people have a decent connection, not many people play anymore, but people still do play. It's worth the gamble. The multiplayer is just ***that*** good.I vote that we get a strong player-base going for this game. The multiplayer gameplay is seriously amazing.I would almost buy this game full-price *just* for the multiplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												-Beautiful visuals.-Rich gameplay in both story mode and multiplayer.-A variety of class and weapon options to select from in game.-Transformations between bi-modal and vehicular forms are flawless.This game is a fast pace and extremely entertaining game to play.  If you're also a fan, Story wise, there are no flaws I can see in the script.  Every character is portrayed perfectly in every aspect and holds a large roster of the characters you love and grew up with. The weapons and vehicles are very balanced.  Though the sequal is coming out soon, I would highly recommend grabbing this game before, especially if it's on sale. My gamer rating of this is, straight out, a 10 of 10!			",52,6,0,6,0,0,2

												Transformers: War for Cybertron has brought back so many memories from my childhood that I can't even begin to explain all of them. Starting from the classic cartoons to the most memorable Beast Wars in the 1990s...If I realized one thing about Transformers, it's the various stories that branch from the original one. It's like the story had so many different parts to it that you could actually see how big that Transformers storyline, no.. universe spanned. For those followers and fans of Transformers, War for Cybertron would be centered around the Generation 1 continuity which is safe to say, .. the original storyline. Dealing with the Great Cybertronian War (Third Cybertronian War), the Autobots and Decepticons have been waging war over countless millenia spanned across the universe. The conflict of ideals and justice that seem to be so deeply rooted that brothers are forced to fight each other and choose sides. ... Well, at least that's my take on the war too. But I digress. There are two story arcs to play through in T:WFC, the Decepticon Saga and the Autobot Saga in Single Player Campaign and the Multiplayer mode. The campaign mode is played from two wholly different perspectives, The Autobots and Decepticons and the personalities experienced in both are so in conflict that you'll immediately see their stances in the war. T:WFC gives you a choice of playing different characters throughout the story arcs so you can take the fight to the skies even. Both ground and air combat is enjoyable enough. You can even play co-op campaign mode upto a max of 3 players so bring friends if you want.What took it for me was playing co-op through the story campaign with my brother. Also Optimus Prime's original voice actor, Peter Cullen. No comparison.If you're new to Transformers, give it a play through and you won't regret it.. it's the best Transformers game in years. And for the fans, you already know that. Either way, .. Transformers: WFC will be leading you to believe that there's more than meets the eye.			",66,4,2,8,3,0,3

I played on EASY mode and it was pretty challenging; it took like 20 tries on the final boss but it was fun to not just blow through the entire game.  When I'm writing this revew I have not played the decepticon storyline yet but I will and the multiplayer is awesome. I have gotten to create some pretty cool custom transformers and heres a tip: go for this abillity on the scientist class where you can change your charecters colours to look like you on the other team.

												I have this game both for my PS3 and for PC here on steam. I feel that this game, and its sequel (Fall of Cybertron) are far more true to The Transformers ethos than any other Transformers game that has been released before or since. Both War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron are under-rated Third Person Shooter and Action classics that deserve to be in the game libraries of any true fan of The Transformers.

												It's hard to make a good licensed game. But War for Cybertron is one of the rare examples of such: An amazingly fun third-person shooter/vehicular combat hybrid that is enriched by it's setting rather then hindered by it. Setting the game on Cybertron itself, millions of years before the Transformers took their war to Earth, was a stroke of genius (as was setting the Decepticon campaign before the Autobot one: villains act, heroes react)- there are no annoying kid sidekicks or shallow love interests here. This is pure metal action, with an impressive array of iconic characters and weapons, reimagined in their native Cybertronian forms. War for Cybertron does an amazing job of portraying the brutality of the Cybertronian wars, and making the planet and it's inhabitants feel truly alive- constantly shifting parts and glowing energy lines pervade the art style. Make of the Michael Bay films what you will- in my mind, THIS is Transformers for a new age.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

												I was iffy on how to recommend this game.  Its a solid 3rd person action game with transformer elements but you dont get the true transformer feel with this game.  When you play as a transformer, you are limited to a few move sets and when you become a vehicle you are a floating object in the form of a vehicle so instead of being a really fast car you are a floating car that looks fast!  Enemy AI is super exploitable and predictable, even your teammate AI is dumb as once during a sequence with pillars that crush during a tunnel sequence both of my AI teammates were crushed to death so i had to wait for them to respawn to finish the level.  The whole game spans i believe 10 levels and they are all basically the same, with the first 5 being about the decepticons and their defeat of the autobots up until Optimus Prime becomes the new leader and such.  It is recommendable on the transformer story but is not on the pretense that its a good playable game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Transformers: War for Cybertron has brought back so many memories from my childhood that I can't even begin to explain all of them. Starting from the classic cartoons to the most memorable Beast Wars in the 1990s...If I realized one thing about Transformers, it's the various stories that branch from the original one. It's like the story had so many different parts to it that you could actually see how big that Transformers storyline, no.. universe spanned. For those followers and fans of Transformers, War for Cybertron would be centered around the Generation 1 continuity which is safe to say, .. the original storyline. Dealing with the Great Cybertronian War (Third Cybertronian War), the Autobots and Decepticons have been waging war over countless millenia spanned across the universe. The conflict of ideals and justice that seem to be so deeply rooted that brothers are forced to fight each other and choose sides. ... Well, at least that's my take on the war too. But I digress. There are two story arcs to play through in T:WFC, the Decepticon Saga and the Autobot Saga in Single Player Campaign and the Multiplayer mode. The campaign mode is played from two wholly different perspectives, The Autobots and Decepticons and the personalities experienced in both are so in conflict that you'll immediately see their stances in the war. T:WFC gives you a choice of playing different characters throughout the story arcs so you can take the fight to the skies even. Both ground and air combat is enjoyable enough. You can even play co-op campaign mode upto a max of 3 players so bring friends if you want.What took it for me was playing co-op through the story campaign with my brother. Also Optimus Prime's original voice actor, Peter Cullen. No comparison.If you're new to Transformers, give it a play through and you won't regret it.. it's the best Transformers game in years. And for the fans, you already know that. Either way, .. Transformers: WFC will be leading you to believe that there's more than meets the eye.			",66,4,2,8,3,0,3

												This game is much longer than FoC and has way more characters to play as. This game lets you choose from 3 characters in each level, and it has online co-op. FoC does not have this. FoC does improve everything from this game, but WfC is still really fun. Battles are intense.			",53,4,0,8,3,0,1

												fairly fun 3rd person shooter as far as the first half of the single player campaign goes. however i suspect it would be funner in co-op. interestingly enough megatron's mouth isn't just a area of the screen shaded untextured red but in fact seems to be the physical embodyment of that color. weird. along with everone elses mouthes for their respective colors. no wonder optimus has a mouth plate in most canons. it isn't prehaps the best game of the genre but if you like shooting big car robots as big car robots then this is a game you may in fact want to try out.IMPORTANT: i had difficulty getting it to run for some reason. what worked for me was spam installing various graphics drivers and rebooting but i think what you may have to do varies case by case.

												Explore the epic war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, where it all began. This game features excellent level design, and a unique campaign, where you spend the second half as the autobots undoing everything you did in the first half as the Decepticons, presenting a sense of primordial balance. With a good story, solid gameplay, near non-stop action, and online multiplayer, this is a good game for Transformers fans and non-fans alike.			",11,2,0,0,0,0,1

												I played this game when it first launched but now I'm just getting around to writing a review about this amazing game. If you are a big Transformers fan like I am then you will adore this game and it's sequel Tranformers Fall of Cyberton! I mean you can be both Autobots and Decepticons! :) The multiplayer is a little dead but there are still people who play it, I don't personally but I did a long time ago. Anyways whethere you blasting Autobot scum or Decepticreeps you can go guns blazing in this awesome game! The campaign is super fun and has a lot of hidden secrets and goodies for you to find. Playing as your favorite tranformers also gives this game a very good feel to it! I mean why wouldn't you lead the charge as Optimus Prime or destroy Cybertron as Megatron?! If you are a big Transformers fan or you like Transformers a lot please buy this game! The campaign alone I think would make it worth it. (On sale of course because I'm a cheap son of a gun!)I think this game is freaking awesome and I just finished the sequel and I think both of these games are amazing.			",47,1,4,2,8,0,5

												This game gave me more then my money's worth. The action packed campaign has a story that kept me interested the entire way though though the overall gameplay can get repetitive. I found myself using the same guns over and over. The fact you can switch between robot and vehicle seemlessly in battle adds a lot of choises for how to handle an encounter, especially when you are in the flying levels. The multiplayer is where this game shines for me. While now adays you will only find maybe one or two games going at any given time it is still a fats paced and fun experience. The majority of my hours with this game are in the multiplayer. The skill ceiling in the game is very high though some aspects and mechanics and classes can be overpowered. The game on consoles was patched with nerfs to the multiplayer that didn't happen on PC. Overall I recommend picking this up if you want a good third person shooter to co-op with friends.

												It isn't the most innovative game I've ever played, but War for Cybertron is head and shoulders above the mass of mediocre tie-ins that normally plague the Transformers franchise, so I've gotta give it props just for not totally sucking. With the ability to transform at will with the push of a button, a storyline depicting the brutal early days of the great war, and solid voice acting all around (including the inimitable Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime), War for Cybertron is a very fun experience, though if you aren't a big fan of the franchise, it might fall a bit flat.

												Definitely has a Master Chief vibe as a 3rd Person Shooter, being able to run into the fray and employ different abilities and weapons to dispatch waves of enemies. Visuals are great and the transforming doesn't leave you wanting. Bosses can be a little lackluster but can be remedied with a change in difficulty. Uses original voice-acting which is great and lets you delve into the world of Cybertron. Great Purchase, definitely something to look out for in sales. 7.4/10			",149,46,1,24,16,0,25

												Epic, visual stunning and IT'S TRANSFORMERS.  Having grown up with the cartoon series and the toys this is childhood dream come true.  The control system seems a little alien at first (unless you have Res Evil 5 and Darksiders in which case it will be quite familiar), however once you get to grips with the controls, this is an incredibly fluid and enjoyable shooter.  The story mode and campaign is great, the sound and voices are G1 authentic and the cybertron enviroment is a real site to behold.  A good selection of weaponry to boot and some useful support make combat really good fun.  The muliplayer pvp and Escalate modes are very good indeed.  My Favourite is Escalate.  4 person team; co-op survival against waves of increasingly tough enemies.   I was suprised to see the meta critic rating on here is 75%.  I personally rate this game a 9 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The problems with previous renditions of Transformers games were probably due to time constraints and goals of quick cash ins. Fortunately, War for Cybertron transcends these limitations as it's neither based off a movie nor a rushed product hoping to ride the wave of passing trends. This particular game outshines the rest. First off, the story is original and different from what we've become accustomed to. Humans are out of the equation and this game focuses on the start of the schism that separated the infamous race of robots. Even better than the campaign though is the multiplayer. The online plays a lot like Call of Duty in that your weapons are customizable and you are rewarded with killstreak bonuses. The cherry on top though, is that you can transform from robot to vehicle any time you want. Needless to say, it's a blast and a must play for fans of third person shooters and the series alike.Grade: B+			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

The graphics are good most systems of today can probably play all settings on extra. Plays a little like gears of war and cod with the mix of the transforming that happens. Great story line and single player campian as well. For a transformers fan a must have. For a fps fan worth checking out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Transformers War for Cybertron is a fun 3rd person shooter with lots of variety.The environments can be distracting but thats only because of it's cybertron style which i suppose fits.The weapons and abilites are interesting and unique. The characters hardly differ from one another but at the end of the day you're going to be choosing your own personal favourite transformer.The campaign is very fun to play, on your own or in co-op. But the fun in this game comes souly from the Multiplayer. Whether you're fending off hordes of robots with your buddies in escalation mode or your having an all out brawl against a rival team competivley, you'll get hours and hours of enjoyment out of this game.75/100			",68,10,2,4,7,0,3

												Excellent game especially if you are a former watcher of the classic cartoons on TV. It features campy gameply with campy plot and dialouge which make it a lovely tribute to the former campy cartoon. The visuals are much different however and take full advantage of the Unreal engine with full screen animations and highly detailed characters and enviroments which I'm sure look epic at the highest detail level but still look damn cool even at medium settings. Still haven't tried multiplayer yet.			",165,24,5,14,11,2,21

												This game is really fun, but they did an asstastic job of porting it to the PC. There's no way to commuicate with other players in game, so there's zero coordination or team work. And while you can ""Make your own transformer"" it really consists of choosing between two different models per class, and then painting it one color.This game could be leauges better, and they've been slowly updating and fixing it, but I don't think it will ever be playable on PC.The single player mode is worth paying $10 for, espeicaly if your a fan of Transformers. So, buy it on sale, if you like Transformers.			",308,83,4,26,25,3,17

												Let me start off by saying, I love this game.BUT I have the same problem with Fall as well. THe trailers compared to the scope of tthe game just don't match up. Being VERY, VERY linear can be good, but it really doesn't work here. Also, ammo conservation= you're good. Also, the color palette is rather disappointing, as the only thing besides grey is the character models. Other than that, the graphics are pretty good.			",62,1,1,4,5,0,5

Discover the world of Cybertron in the midst of a civil war between the two factions, Autobots & Decepticons. Plenty of weapons and ""enemies"". You can play either side and see both halfs of the story. See the plot build up as it gots closer and closer to the fall of this massive planet in the War For Cybertron.			",601,130,37,38,82,5,82

The environments are all moving, changing, and transforming. I loved the part where you had to try to kill trypticon from the inside, then had to escape while he was transforming. I thought it was really cool to see everything shifting around to form something like a giant tyrannasorus rex. This game also had tons of great transformers lore woven into it. This game is good for any third person shooter fan, and especially good for a transformers fan like me.			",32,0,0,0,6,0,0

												This is the first in the Activison transformer series, and the premise of this game is that it takes place during the major war between the Autobots and Decepticons back on their homeworld of planet Cybertron before they come to Earth. I very much like the asethetic of the game. It genuinely feels like you are on planet cybertron and comes off as a nice blend between the polished new look of the recent films, and the familiar character design from the cartoon that many of us die hard fans longed for. The voice acting for the characters is very good, and the soundtrack is very well done as well. Those being said, I do have some major issues with this game. It's not exactly a decent PC port, as the controls feel very awkward at first (especially in vehicle mode), and the game is also locked a 30 fps. Another issue I have is how the characters play. At the beginning of each mission, you are given a choice of playing as one of three transformers, one of which is almost always either Optimus or Megatron for their respective factions. The problem lies in the fact that out side of Prime and Megatron, alot of the characters playstyles are recycled, and the only ones that really feel different are AGAIn, Prime and Megatron, leaving the gameplay feeling very bland to be honest.If you are a transformers fan, I would say this game is a safe purchase, though between this and ""Fall of Cybertron"", this is the clear weaker one of the two.  Ideally I'd suggest waiting for it to go on sale.			",162,10,0,18,10,0,41

												I played this game when it first launched but now I'm just getting around to writing a review about this amazing game. If you are a big Transformers fan like I am then you will adore this game and it's sequel Tranformers Fall of Cyberton! I mean you can be both Autobots and Decepticons! :) The multiplayer is a little dead but there are still people who play it, I don't personally but I did a long time ago. Anyways whethere you blasting Autobot scum or Decepticreeps you can go guns blazing in this awesome game! The campaign is super fun and has a lot of hidden secrets and goodies for you to find. Playing as your favorite tranformers also gives this game a very good feel to it! I mean why wouldn't you lead the charge as Optimus Prime or destroy Cybertron as Megatron?! If you are a big Transformers fan or you like Transformers a lot please buy this game! The campaign alone I think would make it worth it. (On sale of course because I'm a cheap son of a gun!)I think this game is freaking awesome and I just finished the sequel and I think both of these games are amazing.			",47,1,4,2,8,0,5

This game features excellent level design, and a unique campaign, where you spend the second half as the autobots undoing everything you did in the first half as the Decepticons, presenting a sense of primordial balance. With a good story, solid gameplay, near non-stop action, and online multiplayer, this is a good game for Transformers fans and non-fans alike.			",11,2,0,0,0,0,1

												It's a cool game, but it could be hard to get into if you're not already a Transformers fan. There's very little explanation as to who each character is, or much in the way of character development (except for Optimus). You won't even know why you're fighting this war, or what started it, apart from the very obvious fact that Megatron wants to be in charge. However, if you are a Transformers fan, it's a fun experience to play as so many different characters, to have the actual cartoon voices, and to see what happened at the end of the war for Cybertron.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/05/transformers-war-for-cybertron.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												This game gave me more then my money's worth. The action packed campaign has a story that kept me interested the entire way though though the overall gameplay can get repetitive. I found myself using the same guns over and over. The fact you can switch between robot and vehicle seemlessly in battle adds a lot of choises for how to handle an encounter, especially when you are in the flying levels. The multiplayer is where this game shines for me. While now adays you will only find maybe one or two games going at any given time it is still a fats paced and fun experience. The majority of my hours with this game are in the multiplayer. The skill ceiling in the game is very high though some aspects and mechanics and classes can be overpowered. The game on consoles was patched with nerfs to the multiplayer that didn't happen on PC. Overall I recommend picking this up if you want a good third person shooter to co-op with friends.

The story was kinda fun to experience itself, so at cheap sale prices there's no reason not to buy this first installment even if the campaign is short.

It's much more closely linked to the original cartoon series than anything else. BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, it's fun. It has awesome music, awesome gameplay and the voice acting and banter is a clear nod to the original Transformers series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent game especially if you are a former watcher of the classic cartoons on TV. It features campy gameply with campy plot and dialouge which make it a lovely tribute to the former campy cartoon. The visuals are much different however and take full advantage of the Unreal engine with full screen animations and highly detailed characters and enviroments which I'm sure look epic at the highest detail level but still look damn cool even at medium settings. Still haven't tried multiplayer yet.			",165,24,5,14,11,2,21

												Had a lot more fun than I was expecting. Transforming into a car or jet and then speeding away is satisfying. More variations in enviroment and enemy colours would be nice since there is a lot of grey, causing things to blend. Boss battles are cliché that dont offer very much excitement.

												Screw the stupid movies. Thats my attitude and this games doesnt even acknowledge them.  I loved it.  Frankly I didn't have any major glitch issues.  I don't remember having any (people are complaining it has them).  If you were a fan of the cartoon and can deal with a few cartoon/game discrepencies then you will love this game.  Up to 3 player co-op.  Unfortunately, as awesome as the scenery is and as epic as the levels are there just is no significant replayability.  Its worth up to 20 bucks if you dont mind playing it through maybe twice. (I think its like 9 hours).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a cool game, but it could be hard to get into if you're not already a Transformers fan. There's very little explanation as to who each character is, or much in the way of character development (except for Optimus). You won't even know why you're fighting this war, or what started it, apart from the very obvious fact that Megatron wants to be in charge. However, if you are a Transformers fan, it's a fun experience to play as so many different characters, to have the actual cartoon voices, and to see what happened at the end of the war for Cybertron.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/05/transformers-war-for-cybertron.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												The 2nd best Transformer game ever made (the best is the sequel to this game, ""Fall of Cybertron""). It has great graphics and impressive set piece moments/battles coupled with great voice acting for the various iconic robots that we all know and love. The down part is that the game suffers from inconsistent pacing as you alternate between the Autobots and Decepticons' story (and can do so in a non-chronological manner) and can choose from a different 3-set of robots whose abilities don't differ enough from one another to make the combat feel very different. Still a great Transformers game if you're a fan. Play it for the story, the awesome set pieces and then play its sequel.8/10			",142,33,0,14,1,0,2

												This is the first in the Activison transformer series, and the premise of this game is that it takes place during the major war between the Autobots and Decepticons back on their homeworld of planet Cybertron before they come to Earth. I very much like the asethetic of the game. It genuinely feels like you are on planet cybertron and comes off as a nice blend between the polished new look of the recent films, and the familiar character design from the cartoon that many of us die hard fans longed for. The voice acting for the characters is very good, and the soundtrack is very well done as well. Those being said, I do have some major issues with this game. It's not exactly a decent PC port, as the controls feel very awkward at first (especially in vehicle mode), and the game is also locked a 30 fps. Another issue I have is how the characters play. At the beginning of each mission, you are given a choice of playing as one of three transformers, one of which is almost always either Optimus or Megatron for their respective factions. The problem lies in the fact that out side of Prime and Megatron, alot of the characters playstyles are recycled, and the only ones that really feel different are AGAIn, Prime and Megatron, leaving the gameplay feeling very bland to be honest.If you are a transformers fan, I would say this game is a safe purchase, though between this and ""Fall of Cybertron"", this is the clear weaker one of the two.  Ideally I'd suggest waiting for it to go on sale.			",162,10,0,18,10,0,41

												This game is just plain fun.  The first part of the game is the Decepticon campaign to take over Cybertron.  The second half is the Autobot quest to take it back.  I didn't really expect to enjoy the game as much as I did, but after a few levels, I really got into it.  For the uninitiated like me, I still found the plot to be surprisingly interesting.  Believe the high reviews, this game is hours of Transformers shooting and smashing each other to bits with a fairly decent storyline.  This game is often on sale and dirt cheap for the amount of entertainment you get.  I would highly recommend buying this game, even if you're not already a huge fan of the Transformers universe.One con:  I had some problems with the controller support.  However, I switched over to mouse and keyboard and ended up enjoying myself more.			",167,138,2,27,17,1,34

												This game gave me more then my money's worth. The action packed campaign has a story that kept me interested the entire way though though the overall gameplay can get repetitive. I found myself using the same guns over and over. The fact you can switch between robot and vehicle seemlessly in battle adds a lot of choises for how to handle an encounter, especially when you are in the flying levels. The multiplayer is where this game shines for me. While now adays you will only find maybe one or two games going at any given time it is still a fats paced and fun experience. The majority of my hours with this game are in the multiplayer. The skill ceiling in the game is very high though some aspects and mechanics and classes can be overpowered. The game on consoles was patched with nerfs to the multiplayer that didn't happen on PC. Overall I recommend picking this up if you want a good third person shooter to co-op with friends.

												2 hours in and i really like this game. combat is is a bit easy but fun none the less, what i really like is the movment and controls they are so smooth doesnt feel slow and unresposive and swapping from vehicle to robot is a click and its done, no  waitin no slowing down combat just great fun.  o and switching from a flyer to a robot and smashing some ones face in is just oerfection.

												Despite the bad taste the (terrible) movie games left in people's mouths, this one was actually incredibly fun. I really liked both the art style and the storytelling, and despite its short play time with little replayability it was definitely worth the purchase. --Of course, I got it during a sale for $5, but hey, still makes me look forward to Fall of Cybertron.

												An entertaining if flawed game, and I can easily forgive its little imperfections. A game, movie or story made with passion has the ability to carry that passion through to the audience, and it's clear that High Moon loves Transformers. For me this was a nostalgic experience, but a hungry one. Not since the original cartoons and toys have I felt as drawn in to the setting.			",113,13,0,10,2,0,9

												fairly fun 3rd person shooter as far as the first half of the single player campaign goes. however i suspect it would be funner in co-op. interestingly enough megatron's mouth isn't just a area of the screen shaded untextured red but in fact seems to be the physical embodyment of that color. weird. along with everone elses mouthes for their respective colors. no wonder optimus has a mouth plate in most canons. it isn't prehaps the best game of the genre but if you like shooting big car robots as big car robots then this is a game you may in fact want to try out.IMPORTANT: i had difficulty getting it to run for some reason. what worked for me was spam installing various graphics drivers and rebooting but i think what you may have to do varies case by case.

												I played this game when it first launched but now I'm just getting around to writing a review about this amazing game. If you are a big Transformers fan like I am then you will adore this game and it's sequel Tranformers Fall of Cyberton! I mean you can be both Autobots and Decepticons! :) The multiplayer is a little dead but there are still people who play it, I don't personally but I did a long time ago. Anyways whethere you blasting Autobot scum or Decepticreeps you can go guns blazing in this awesome game! The campaign is super fun and has a lot of hidden secrets and goodies for you to find. Playing as your favorite tranformers also gives this game a very good feel to it! I mean why wouldn't you lead the charge as Optimus Prime or destroy Cybertron as Megatron?! If you are a big Transformers fan or you like Transformers a lot please buy this game! The campaign alone I think would make it worth it. (On sale of course because I'm a cheap son of a gun!)I think this game is freaking awesome and I just finished the sequel and I think both of these games are amazing.			",47,1,4,2,8,0,5

												Explore the epic war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, where it all began. This game features excellent level design, and a unique campaign, where you spend the second half as the autobots undoing everything you did in the first half as the Decepticons, presenting a sense of primordial balance. With a good story, solid gameplay, near non-stop action, and online multiplayer, this is a good game for Transformers fans and non-fans alike.			",11,2,0,0,0,0,1

												The Good: Excellent story, brings back the golden days, solid shooting, diverse weapons, looks greatThe Bad: Repetitive after awhile, abilities and transforming are practically useless, unbalanced difficulty, so-so multiplayerTransformers has always been one of those licenses that has struggled in the gaming world that produced mediocre to abysmal products that were quickly forgotten. The fine men and women at High Moon Studios have finally delivered the first excellent Transformers game that brings us back to the beloved cartoons we grew to and embrace in our hearts.You play both the Decepticon and Autobot campaigns, but you start out as the Decepticons trying to use Dark Energon to hijack the core of Cybertron and destroying the Autobots in the process. When you start each chapter you can choose one of three Transformers to play as and in the Decepticon campaign (minus the Star Scream mission) you can play as either Megatron (yes!), Soundwave, or Breakdown. Each one has unique abilities and starts out with their own weapons. Once you jump into the game controls play out like a standard third person shooter, but the game does a bit more for us here.You can carry two weapons at all times and of course you have to reload and acquire more ammo, but some times you'll find a really big weapon that you can carry, but switching to other weapons will drop it. You can use your abilities such as sucking life from enemies, or hovering, but as you can see the abilities are pretty lackluster and you never really use them ever! To regenerate your abilities you must collect fallen Energon from dead enemies. You can also transform into your vehicle form, but once again you never really have to do this unless your traveling long distances or your almost forced to. The transformations are seamless, but there's just no reason to really do it since your firearms are sufficient enough.You can throw grenades as well and one such grenade called the healing grenade is excellent since it creates a healing bubble that comes in handy a lot. The weapons are pretty versatile and very useful and High Moon did a good job giving a nice selection and you really have to decide what's the best weapon for the situation, especially during boss fights.While the game play is solid it needs to be more cinematic. The game is very straight forward and just same throughout. It's just kill wave after wave after wave then kill this boss. Each chapter replays the same formula, but offers just enough diversity to keep you playing. I wanted the game to be more cinematic and varied in game play, but maybe next time around. The game looks very good, but some of the textures are on the low resolution side, and it could have also looked so much better. However, the art style is spot on and really makes you feel like your fighting this massive war on Cybertron. The voice acting is top notch and everyone sounds alike, or almost like, their cartoon counterparts personalities and all. I do have to point out that the AI is pretty solid and gives you a good challenge, but the difficulty is poorly balanced due to easy sections then a sudden section that you die in 10 times.The multiplayer side is fun with the escalation mode that pits you against wave after wave of enemies, but the competitive side is pretty standard and not very exciting after awhile. With a compelling story, and solid enough game play and variety to keep any Transformer fan, or newcomers alike, busy but you won't have a reason to come back to play through Cybertron again unless you just want to hear your favorite metal men talk.~Score: 8/10			",240,30,8,29,14,2,22

												Transformers™: War for Cybertron™ is a fast paced MPFPS with a single player element thats more like training than a storyline. What Tranformers lacks in SP storyline it makes up for in MP gameplay flexibility, offering players a worthy perspective on the tactical advantages and awesome firepower of a multipurpose war machine.

												I don't usually enjoy shooting games all that much but for some reason I like this game.  It's got characters I grew up with & gameplay that mimics the show to near perfection.  I don't really have a lot to say about the game but if you like Transformers then you should probably get this game.  If you don't like them then wait for a sale & get it.  Just make sure you have a controller cause the mouse controls are kind of janky for some parts of the game, especially when flying a jet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a great game..Love the transformers war for Cyberton..much better then the movie crap games..just one issue I have.THE AI allies will spend more time up your♥♥♥♥♥then doing anything useful. Instead of shooting Bad guys..or aiding others they are hounding around you like a ♥♥♥♥ing croutch sniffing dog. Tryinng to get OMGA SUPRIME up, and going..and trying to keep ratchet safe..and pime, and iron hide are hanging around doing jack, and♥♥♥♥♥♥.like two teenage girls sharing selfies.  They might as call you ♥♥♥♥ing rambo cause your pretty much doing all the kill, and aiding of down help more then the AI...and I swear the shots fired some times go right through the guys your aiming for at times..but that might just be me..is the game worth getting..hell yes. Just be ready to have two brain dead cabbages following you around..waiting for the right moment to get in your way..or bump you off the freaken road.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												-Beautiful visuals.-Rich gameplay in both story mode and multiplayer.-A variety of class and weapon options to select from in game.-Transformations between bi-modal and vehicular forms are flawless.This game is a fast pace and extremely entertaining game to play.  If you're also a fan, Story wise, there are no flaws I can see in the script.  Every character is portrayed perfectly in every aspect and holds a large roster of the characters you love and grew up with. The weapons and vehicles are very balanced.  Though the sequal is coming out soon, I would highly recommend grabbing this game before, especially if it's on sale. My gamer rating of this is, straight out, a 10 of 10!			",52,6,0,6,0,0,2
