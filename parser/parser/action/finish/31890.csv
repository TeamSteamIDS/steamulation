												I loved this game. It is filled with information about the Mayan people and the end is unpredictable. Don't skip it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of my favorite Nancy Drew games.  I've played this through at least twice, once on my own account and once on a friends (before I bought it for myself).  If you like the ND games then you will love this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a long time Nancy Drew fan, I can say Secret of the Scarlet Hand is a classic! It has a great plot, good amount of puzzles, and leaves no questions unanswered. It's also super informative about the Mayan culture!			",1,3,0,0,1,0,0

												Okay. So I've played a lot of Nancy Drew games. This is not one of my favorites. I actually don't care for it that much. The fact that the game doesn't even start off a mystery is a little, well, droll. Essentially, you start off wih tasks to do (which I found rather boring) and after doing some you get thrown into a case. I could just be picky, but I'm almost done with the game and I just don't care for it.			",11,10,0,5,1,0,0

												I find the topic of Maya lore super boring, so I had a hard time enjoying this game for a large portion. It starts off with ""not so much detective puzzles"" but rather ""work puzzles"", but that's alright. It didn't take me long to get pen +paper out. As soon as the proper crime happened, though, it got gradually more interesting.What was bugging me the most, from a practical point of view, were the long documents on Nancy's laptop because of the lack of scrollbar handles and hinderingly slow scrolling arrows. That and the fact that your savegames say nothing useful at all, not even a timestamp. Just ""Something is saved here"" â€“ literally!6.0 / 10.0			",61,71,0,5,2,0,0

												If it's on sale or you got it in the Nancy Drew bundle then go for it but if you're looking for a fun adventure game there are better ND titles to play.Welcome to tedious city! You're helping out at a musuem at first, which means a lot of boring tasks you have to do before the case even starts. And even once things pick up you STILL have to finish all your meaningless tasks to progress through the game. Solving the mystery in this game always feels like a second thought since Nancy is stuck having to do everything else. And even when you DO solve it the story isn't very memoriable.Wasn't bad, had it's fun moments but not the best ND title.			",755,739,13,153,132,9,142
