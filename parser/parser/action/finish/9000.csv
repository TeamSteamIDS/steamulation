												Spear of Destiny is one of the most challenging shooters I've ever had the pleasure (although sometimes the pleasure turned into despair and anger) of playing in my whole life.It took me my sweet time, several years, to finish it. But I finally beat the whole episode today. 18 maps of pure awesomeness. The last map is one of the best maps ever to be a final map in any game. I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I saw it.Now, this game is not for amateurs. If you beat the first Wolfenstein 3D game, and I mean all 6 episodes of it, in I'M DEATH INCARNATE, well, you're still gonna have quite the challenge when you play this one. Imagine the last map in episode 2, but 10x harder.Any true Wolfenstein fan knows about this game, but if you've never heard of it and loved Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein 3D and are excited about The New Order, well, you should give this one a spin. Might be the little retro experience you were looking for. And, of course, it will keep you in your seat while you wait for The New Order to come out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spear of Destiny is another of id Software's amazing deliveries. A sequel to what is probably my favorite game of all time, Wolfenstein 3D.The settings they chose for DOSBox don't appeal to me however. I am not keen on using filtered graphics. I like crisp pixels. If you would like to see what I mean there, is an easy way to set the graphics very crisp and original feeling, and while we are at it, we can also smooth out animation a lot:1. Right-Click the game in Steam, and choose ""Properties"".2. Click on the ""Local Files"" tab.3. Click ""Browse Local Files"".4. Double click the ""base"" directory.5. Open ""SOD.conf"" with notepad.6. Look for the ""[sdl]"" section.7. Change ""output=ddraw"" to ""output=overlay"".8. Scroll down to ""[cpu]"" section.9. Change ""cycles=auto"" to ""cycles=12000"".Save and exit notepad.Run the game and enjoy.This smooths out animation greatly, and provides original crisp feeling graphics. Some people prefer the filtered look, if that's you, just leave it as ddraw and only change the ""cycles"" option.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having beaten Wolf3d many times and with The New Order coming out, I figured I'd finally get around to playing The Spear of Destiny. Yes, this is a lot like Wolf3d but that's not really a bad thing. The levels seem a little more open and the bosses seem a little more difficult. Actually, the game in a whole is a lot more difficult than Wolf3d. And while it doesn't have MechaHitler (who happens to be one of my favorite video game bosses of all time) the end level is quite awesome both pre and post obtaining the spear. A must play for anyone who enjoyed Wolf3d.. I actually think I liked it more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You could argue that this game is to Wolfenstein 3D what Doom 2 is to Ultimate Doom.It is, but that's not saying much, since Wolfenstein 3D didn't offer much to add on to in the first place.All the same problems are there, and the game is given a much shorter, higher intensity length with a better sense of context. It isn't especially bad, but, well, read my Wolfenstein 3D review to see my thoughts on this game.All the same pros and cons are there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A prequel to Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny tells its own story. Borrowing many of the mechanics from the first game, this feels very much like more of the same, which is not a bad thing at all.If you play this, I strongly suggest following the below guide (all credit goes to OP):


How to replace dosbox and get a good graphic and sound 
A Guide for Wolfenstein 3D: Spear of Destiny
By: _DOOMMASTER_

			An easy-done exercise with 100% success!!!		


Using ECWolf, it adds many modernisations to the game, such as being able to shoot with the mouse, which we take for granted in modern-day shooters.Every bit as iconic as the original Wolfenstein 3D, this game deserves to be played. As a bonus, Missions 2 & 3 (Return to Danger and Ultimate Challenge) are included free of charge. While certainly not essential after the base game, they are a pleasant addition regardless.Played on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any problems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is basically an expansion for Wolfenstein 3D, but instead of it being divided into episodes it is one longer mission with bosses every few levels. It also has a really cool ending that reminded me of DOOM! Plus you get 2 mission packs for Spear of Destiny, but I didn't really like them. Some of the mission pack levels force you to find secrets to continue, have fun smashing your face in the wall. The mission packs do add different textures that make the game look and sound completely different, for better or worse. But the bosses in the mission packs are the same from the main game, and the ending is the same too, but it does actually have DOOM references. I did really enjoy playing the main missions, just not the mission packs. I would recommend Spear of Destiny to any Wolf3D fan.9/10(P.S. You have to press a button to move left and right by looking left and right, you can't look and move side to side at the same time, that is what made this game slightly challenging for me.)

												A standalone of Wolfenstein which extends the story and gameplay of Wolfenstein 3D. The Spear of Destiny is said to be the lance of Versailles which was touched by Jesus, those who harness it are said to become immortal. The Wermarcht seek it out as B.J sets out to kill them before they steal it. Gameplay Your standard fare of Nazi-killin', secret spotting and meal gobbling franticness. Same as Wolfenstein 3D but with far more variety in map design and secret layouts also spots some of the most fanciest level design I have seen for a game of its age, Hallways are decroated with the skeletons of the dead, crumbling caverns with foliage and cathedrals with stained glass and portraitures of Hitler's ugly mug. Gunplay Handles the same as Wolfenstein 3D. You are locked to the X axis and cannot aim up or down (unless you use a different source port than the one given!) and you have to use your mouse keys or a mouse. Graphics Textures are more contrasting and pleasing to the eyes, patterns on walls don't look as bad (not as blocky as before). The immersion factor impresses me because of their creative use of 2D sprites giving the room a stylistic flare and the thematic style is consistent and believable. Mechanics The mechanics are very simple in Wolfenstein, you simply aim left or right aligning your shot to the enemy on screen and hit LMB (Left Mouse Button) to fire at him. Once he goes down he may drop ammo. Picking up treasure increases your score! Pressing Space on screen interacts with the environment and can unlock secrets. Progress through to the room with a switch 'Exit' to finish the level and to move on! Easy peazy. Story Stop Hitler and the Nazi's from gaining the powers held in the Holy Lance stolen from Versailles which will grant him UNLIMITED POWER! Criticisms; Minor Use of DOSBOX. DOSBOX has limited features and is best avoided if you cannot be bothered to navigate through an emulated DOS environment, Google ECWOLF and install it to have better sound and graphics without awful stuttering or unintuitive user interfaces.N.B - Ignore my current tallied time for this game, since DOSBOX and Steam do not record offline or the use of Source Ports to enhance or return the game to it's original playability.

												Spear of Destiny is a prequel to Wolfenstein 3D released months after Wolf came out. The Steam release also contains two third-party mission packs released in 1994.If you're one of those folks looking for more classic Wolfenstein, the Spear of Destiny campaign is what you want: a challenging - if occasionally unfair - distillation of everything that made the original great in one single contiguous 'episode'. The only notable additions as far as I'm aware are new bosses, new music (the title track is my favorite), ammo boxes with 25 bullets each, and a couple of new textures.The mission packs...aren't great. They were cash-ins by a company called FormGen, and are nothing more than janky reskins of the main Spear of Destiny campaign wrapped around amateur level design. I had to spurn my purism and turn on ECWolf's automap because I just did not want to put up with stumbling around maze after maze, not to mention level progression and even bosses hidden behind secrets.Par times, boss names and a couple other things aren't changed from the original campaign, because it was only possible for FormGen to do sound and graphics swaps. Expect to be able to complete levels in as little as 30 seconds merely by stumbling across the exit, giving you stupidly high par bonuses.Most of the new assets are actually pretty good, although some are just weird. They give the missions a different feel at least, but I wouldn't consider them essential playing even if you're the type of person who would buy Spear of Destiny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wolfenstein 3D: The Spear of Destiny is a standalone expansion pack for Wolfenstein 3D released in 1992. It serves as a prequel to Wolfenstein 3D. The gameplay is the same As Wolfenstein 3D. The only real difference is the level design, the graphics, one new enemy (excluding bosses) and a new item. The level design is very bad. The levels are much more maze like and seems to be confusing just to make the game more difficult and I even had trouble navigating some levels with ECWolfs automap sytem. Contributing to the mazelike feel is the new textures, which doesn`t fit the setting and seemed to be placed randomly. There are no new weapons. There is a new item in the form of ammo boxes. It is a green box that gives you 25 ammo. The gameplay is still great and despite the annoying levels I would still recommend Spear of Destiny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The prequel to Wolfenstein 3D, unlike Wolf3D with it's 6 episodes with 9 levels each SoD has a single ""episode"" consisting of 19 levels. The enemies remain the same with the guards, SS soldiers, officers and mutants, only the bosses are new.Weapons also are the same you used in the previous game ranging from the knife to the pistol to submachinegun and finally the chaingun, however since some levels can have large amounts of enemies you usually find yourself low if not out of ammo as you can only carry 99 bullets at a time.As with Wolf3D the controls can be a bit finicky and the damage dealt by enemies is pretty random randing from tickling to dealing way over half of your hitpoints in damage so be prepared to save a lot.Overall a rather enjoyable experience despite it's age			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Quick Breakdown: A sequel to the revolutionary Wolfenstein 3D, it’s not as much fun, and the level design is more frustrating, but it does make some small improvements non-the-less.Length: 3 hours (Main game)Genre: FPSScore: 5.25/10Review Date: 2016-07-08*******************************************************************************************************Full Review: Released a mere 4 months after Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Desinty (SOD) largely offers more of the same. It doesn’t deviate from the original game much, largely serving as an extra set of levels, albeit more difficult.Level design is much more inconsistent this time around, while some levels offer up a fun, maze-like challenge, others are merely labyrinthine tedium. Combat heavy areas tend to fare better in terms of gameplay. The game likes to throw passages at you with little alcoves with enemies on each side. This leads to a lot of annoying deaths from something that doesn’t really contribute to the game much at all.Gameplay is essentially identical to original, you again have a knife for melee combat (which I never used), a pistol, a machine gun, and a chain gun, each essentially just shooting faster than the last. Ammo occasionally becomes too scarce during highly concentrated enemy areas, but it’s not too much of an issue.Like the other game, SOD has a control scheme that’s pretty dated, and I modded it to play more how I want to, (instructions on how to do so after the review). The game is still pretty primitive, featuring no height variation in the levels, and little variation of any kind. It gets pretty repetitive, and sometimes just frustratingly boring.The game boasts 21 levels, including secret and boss levels, and will take you around 3 hours to run through. This time around, levels aren’t divided into chapters, you play straight through from start to finish. (One of the minor improvements of the game).There are two bonus mission packs, each offering an additional 21 levels, following basically the same scheme as the base game. These weren’t included in the original release of SOD, but were released 2 years later in 1994. I’ve yet to play these, as I’ve had about enough of old school Wolfenstein for quite a while, and I’m not sure if I’ll come back to them or not. Still, they’re there for anyone that does care.If you do plan on getting this, you’re best off getting the Wolf Pack, which includes Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny, and the 2001 sequel Return To Castle Wolfenstein (which I’ve not yet played). It’s pretty cheap, and will get you the most bang for your buck when it comes to the old school Wolfenstein games.Spear of Destiny is by no means an essential release, but it’s still some extra levels for Wolfenstein fans. Grab it from the pack if you want it, just know that it doesn’t hold up as well as the original.*******************************************************************************************************Modding Instructions: So for modding, I didn’t do anything fancy or complicated. Here’s a step by step guide:1). Download the ECWolf source port, it’s what I used, and it’s all I needed for this game. It’s based off the ZDoom mod for the Doom games, and works with Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny, and Super 3D Noah’s Ark (wtf). You can download ECWolf here[maniacsvault.net].2). You need to navigate to a certain folder in your Wolfenstein directory. Since you downloaded it off Steam, by default that’ll be:C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Spear of Destiny\baseCopy paste that into Windows Explorer/File Explorer and it should take you there. If not, copy paste the following:%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Steam\SteamApps\common\Spear of Destiny\baseIf neither of those work, you’ll have to find where you saved it since you’re not using the default location.3). That ECWolf  you downloaded in step 1? Copy/paste the zip folder it gave you into the location from step 1. Then unzip/extract all the contents of that folder into the folder from step 1. (the Spear of Destiny\base folder).4). In the same folder, look for something named “dosbox.exe” and rename it to “Steamdosbox.exe”.5). Still in the same folder, look for “ecwolf.exe” and rename it to “dosbox.exe”.Congrats! You’ve now modded your game to feature more modern controls, better key bindings, unlimited saves, and you can use the Steam overlay while in game now. The game is still launched through Steam normally, and it’ll still track your playtime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
