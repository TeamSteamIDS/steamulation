												Despite the bad reviews, I found the first Garshasp game to be a fun hack and slash.  This game, however, is horrible.  Almost unplayable for the bad camera angles and glitches.  At only 2 hrs long, I found that I couldn't wait for it to be over.  STAY AWAY!			",733,177,23,71,37,7,90

												This game lacks effort and polish, it feels like more of an old tech demo than anything. You can complete the game in less than 2 hours but I couldn't stick with it long enough to do even that. Terrible voice acting, mumbled sounds, poor attack and movement mechanics, and lack of an interesting story make this a game that should be avoided. Look at this still from the opening cutscene in the game and you'll get an idea of what you will exerience when playing:


The facial expressions are worse than the voice acting. That's saying something!

												I installed, finished and uninstalled this game already. This is basicly a 3D platform/hack'n'slash and the most terrible game i've ever played. There's not a single part of this game which isn't ♥♥♥♥ed up. The story, the characters (all 3 of them - 2 npc + you), the graphic, the controls, the camera handling, etc., even the puzzles cursed by the terrible controls, still the puzzles are the best parts of this game. If you wonder how hard is this game, it isn't. The most common cause of death will be falling from high places. I died dozens of times from falling while died only once during battle (if i dont count when i fell trough the floor in a battle once). And the most annoying part of all is the balance, because there isn't any, based on the steam counter it took me 2,5 hour to beat game, but from it only the final boss fight was more than half an hour. Because that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cheating as hell and i especially hate when developers use this kinda trick to extend the games length. I was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥after a while, i started for looking cheats, unfortunately i didn't found any.There are no options, so you can't do anything besides playing. Also you can't  skip the end credits, so you're forced to watch every name whos are responsible for wasting 2-3 hour from you life. Also as a fun fact you can see how much people need to make a terrible game.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The prequel to the ""Garshasp: The Monster Slayer"" game.While the game is very short, 1,5 - 2hrs to beat it, I experienced the same dull combat like in the predecessor, but level design that is even more uninspired, more FPS drops, more bugs, and hilariously bad writing and cutscenes (the opening animation is comedy gold: ""Well at least let's take a rest. I'm your brother. Can't you see I'm dying?!"")The only noteworthy thing is that the combat animations are slightly, slightly better.Avoid.			",218,42,1,17,6,2,18

												Literally one of the worst games I have ever played with one redeeming value: It is mercifully short. If it did not crash or softlock so often, probably less than 1,5 hours, maybe even 1 hour.Everything I could say has been said: Terrible controls, laughable animations with dated graphics, a camera that is actively fighting the player.The first game was not that bad, even if it gave me a bluescreen and was dead after I saved my computer, I was only 15 minutes from finishing that. This one on the other hand is an insult to players. Trust the reviews, do not waste your time.			",297,47,11,32,22,4,44

												i really enjoyd the first garshasp so i tought i would play thisone. my first impression was this doesnt look like a sequel. i tought the first one was better but then again i playd it so long ago and just began thisone. performance is somewhat odd, getting frame drops here and there, NOT braking unplayable but non the less noticeable. i play it with xbox 360 pad and everything is great exept for the game not using xbox buttons on screen when action cutscenes show up and u need to press a specific button. That leaves you guessing what button needs to be pressed and makes you die and repeat until you figure it out. The game seems to have more puzzles than the first one, im barely starting it and already have had several simple puzzles. im positive once i learn the buttons i will enjoy the rest of the game very much. OH my only real complaint is  the camera is so bad, very bad, it will point the camera to the worse position it can and it will move it at the worse moment possible. very annoying... I was looking for a onscreen button mod/fix for the 360 pad to show correct buttons on screen and found many people on the discussion section saying the game doesnt work for them or very bad performance. I had no problem installing or running the game on windows 8 x64. there was definitly some lazy work done because i do get slight frame drops that shouldn't happen on a game with these kind of visuals. shame on you DEADMAGE group for that. and its the reason i am not recomending the game.

												This game plays as if it was created by a 13 year old pubescent virgin. The cut scenes appear to be thrown together; graphics were crappy, dialogue was poorly written, and the voice acting was attrocious (almost sounds like the voices were computer generated as opposed to being voiced by a real human). The gameplay was bland, combat felt clunky with the keyboard and mouse, but improves with a controler. I'd say that the controller support is one of the few highlights of the game. It's clear that this game had a low budget. Low budget games don't have to be bad. I've played plenty of low budget games that had incredible gameplay and imaginitive stories (vvvvvv is one that comes to mind). It sort of feels like dead mage blew the entire budget on graphics at the expense of every other aspect of game play. I realize that I probably spent more time downloading this game than actually playing it; however, if someone had a gun to my head forcing me to play this game or die, I'd probably rip the gun out of my captor's hands and take my own life.

If you die when it is near the ceiling, despite you have saved BEFORE moving it, you'll find yourself stuck since you can't jump on the platform which is far far away from you.

												Before you make this purchase allow me to give you both positives and negatives on this game. Lets start with the positive, The Graphics in the game is not bad, and work well with the game. The Story is ok.  now we get to the game killing aspects of the game for me. The controls are mediocare at best, what makes this worse is that the game changes the camera angle in some instances making it worse, this is componded since you cant change the angle (as far as i could tell).  I played the game as long as I could hoping that it would get better it just got worse. I promptly removed the game off my computer.
