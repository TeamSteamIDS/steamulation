												Game of my childhood. One of the best 2D shooters I've ever played. Special effects are the best. There is blood everywhere. After many years I still love this game more than John Paul the 2nd. The only minus of this game is nothing.			",54,2,2,8,16,0,20

												This game is a masterpiece of old-school arcade shooting, that deserves a permanent place in my favorite games list <3<3<3 +Soundwork - great music and sound effects.+Visuals - with a maximum resolution of 1024x768 - this game still looks beautiful in 2016 - funny enemies exploding to expose their interior :), bullet shells, box pieces and body pieces keep lay on the ground, so after some time the whole level is covered with them. +Gameplay - Awesome arcade - simply shoot ALL the enemies to go to the next level, you have tons of secrets to explore, you have cash grabs to buy new weapons and ammo, and you have various pickups to make your life easier. You can also spend your cash in implant stuff into your character's body to improve stats, like less recoil, more speed etc :) There is even plot going through all the levels of the bloodfest.  +Enormous amounts of enemies.Most important - you can never feel safe - you think that you nearly clear the level, casually picking up last ammo packs and then all the walls exploding you are getting attacked from all sides, cornered and ripped into pieces <3 10/10 would butthurt again. To complete the game you will need something around 10 hours I think.+Controls - simple and great - you can use WASD, v^<> or simply hold right mouse button Diablo 2 style to run, and left mouse button to shoot, scroll up or Numbers to change your weapons.-Maximum resolution of 1024x768 AND no window mode-No steam achievements -No steam cardsWhat would be an amazing thing if someone would add HD-textures and window mode.If the low-res fullscreen is really a problem for you - as far as I remember *Dxwnd* (google it like Dxwnd window mode) should do the trick :)

												Ever wanted to know what it feels like to be swarmed by armies of 700+ giant aliens with miniguns strapped to their backs while you run away screaming like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ with your dual-wield Beretta 92fs pistols?This game will give you that experience.I just had to get this game. I used to play the demo all the time as a 6 year old to 8 year old kid. Oh, the fond memories of playing this game behind my mother's back because she didn't like of all the violence >_>.Well anyway, I am now an adult, and I have returned to Alien Shooter in order to revisit some of my most fond childhood memories... and thank god that this game is still as good as it was back when I first played it.The game's title is pretty straight-forward, and there's not much more to it then that. You're sent into a military complex all by yourself, which has been infested with aliens. Your job is to stop all of the aliens from escaping and going out into the world to wreck havoc, by mass-murdering every single mother-♥♥♥♥ing alien in sight and paint the entire floor and walls with so much blood that the smell would probably be enough to render you unconscious.You start out with your dual-wield pistols, but eventually, you'll unlock a multitude of other weaponry to blow up everything in sight, such as shotguns, miniguns, laser assault rifles, plasma miniguns, rocket launchers, magma guns, and a floating orb buddy who murders everything in sight for you so you don't have to. And I have to say, killing aliens with all of these weapons at your fingertips is surprisingly therapeutic and insanely fun.There are also some minor RPG elements in the game, such as the ability to level up 'skills', the ability to choose your gender, and your name. My favourite part about this game would have to be it's soundtrack. I remember as a kid, upon loading up the game for the first time and hearing the main menu music, it literally sent chills down my spine, and it still does to this day.The only downside to the game I could possibly think of, however, is that the game is very short. I personally finished it in two hours in one sitting, and sadly there is not that much replay value other than survival mode. Overall, the game was very good for it's time, and without a doubt it still holds up today. It is worth your time if you either need something fresh to play, or if you just want to kill some time. If this game is ever on sale, or you have $5 to burn, it is worth a go....or you could just buy Alien Shooter 2.			",86,10,0,16,4,1,0

												Played it many many times eons ago (I have the CD for quite a while now).It is truly a classic for me. Ideal for relieving stress.About the gameplay:- Find the entrance- Switch on your flashlight- Collect ammo (and weapons)- Find and start the generator in the building- Wait a couple of seconds- Shoot- Shoot more- Shoot even more- Collect ammo- Shoot- Shoot more- Shoot even more- Shoot the sh*t out of them- Kill 'em- Kill 'em like a rabid animal- Kill 'em like a rabid animal with style- Shoot something that ends the level- Develop your character- RepeatI really like the crazy amount of monsters, who are waiting just for you to massacre them.If you like this, check out the other episodes, they are basicly the same as this here.... and of course check out Zombie Shooter 1-2, too!

												Unfortunately this review is tinted with my nostalgia goggles, and thus might not be the best one to base your purchase on.I grew up considering that blood is a bit icky in games, and Alien Shooter provided me with the option of green blood! Somehow this added a family friendly perk to it for me. Since discovering it on a CD Action CD, I've smuggled it onto the school computers, my mum's work computer... everything I could get my hands on. I still can play it today with a smile on my face with fitting music, tight controls and many, many secrets. Yes I would recommend it for a timewaster, with that little bit of exploration to it. It's a nice game for it's time: Proof, that Indie games could have good production value, even before all these luxuries we have today.			",254,33,11,22,31,2,54

												Don't let the graphics fool you. This is an excelent isometric shooter that leaves you feeling like a God of death by the end. The power creep is almost perfectly designed assuming you pay attention and buy all the new shiney guns when you can. The first time you wipe out an entire room in one shot is one hell of a feeling.Highly recommended. I'm currently on my second play through.			",403,146,28,36,41,7,62

												This tiny game has literally become a classic over all these years. A dozen of guns, hordes of enemies, simplistic, yet dynamic and fast-paced gameplay and lots of gore. What else is needed for a good game about killing aliens? Well, maybe a little more than ten fairly modest levels that can be beaten in just two hours. But considering when and by whom Alien Shooter was made these problems are understandable. This game also has a number of sequels that somewhat help with it's short length, but I would prefer all them compiled in one 'big' game (a re-release, maybe?) than in five different short ones.

												So, what should I say about this game ...This is Alien Shooter. If you haven't played any of if incartations in the past you probably don't like top-down shooters because else it's very hard to avoid this series.Back in the days when this first installment came out it represented the pinnacle of Windows top-down shooting action games. Nowadays finally there are actual versions of games like Alien Breed from the Commodore Amiga but nonetheless this game has it's charme throwing endless waves of aliens at you, hunting down secrets in the maze-like-levels or just listening to the very good background music.If you want a little distraction from your everyday shooter schedule and already are into this kind of games, you should absolutely give this little gem a try. But I'd recommend to wait 'til it's on discount because for the full price you could even get some installment of the former mentioned Alien Breed Series that's technically and in terms of athmosphere miles above this one here.In fact that doesn't harm the pure and timeless no brain shooting action Alien Shooter has to offer.

												7/10There are some old games that don't age well. I'm glad to say that Alien Shooter isn't one of them.It's a simple premise that works perfectly - move and shoot all aliens in sight, just as the name implies. There are some upgrades to be purchased and a decent variety of weapons to use. And while the player will have to fight huge hordes of enemies, there's actually a good variety of enemies to fight and they often require different strategies to be dealt with since some weapons will work better against certain enemies than others.And while it may sound a little repetitive, the game is a lot of fun - and it lasts just enough that it doesn't feel too short while also not feeling like it's stretching for longer than it should.There are only two problems that I'd mention about the game. The first is that it can be a little too hard sometimes. Even with the best weapons, there are certain parts of the game on later levels where the player will be forced on a unfair situation - like being stuck on a room with too many enemies and not enough room to maneuver around, which is a huge problem since mobility is a large factor on this game.The second is the camera. Because of its angled top-down view, some things (enemies, more than often) will show up behind walls and the player can't see what's behind them because of the camera's angle. The camera is fixed and there's no transparency effect, so that's often an issue.But even so, this still doesn't detract from the fun the game provides.			",1990,640,63,205,142,17,217

												A thoroughly enjoyable arcade-style shooter with a small upgrade system and a decent selection of standard weapons.I managed to clear a single playthrough of the campaign mode without seeing a continue screen or game over, collecting all of the upgrades and guns.  The game's pretty short, but I have to say that if you can get it for a good price, it's definitely worth a play.			",850,155,26,144,50,4,79

You can upgrade your character, buy armor, gadgets, weapons and ammunition in the pre-mission menu when you do the campaign. You can also buy lives, and when you are dead too much, it's over.If you're not sure wether to buy it or not, there is a demo.

												Great and classic shooter that you can finish in about 1,5 hours. It's not a game that you want to play for the second time AFTER you finish it. I've finished this one like some years ago and now finished it again. It's type of a game that you run once in a while but still have fun with it.What you see is what you get basically - treat this game like a Serious Sam, only in 2D with isometric view. Nine guns, tons of aliens to kill, some upgrades to buy. Grab a beer and crisps and have fun. ---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unpretentious and well made classic.  Pretty short, takes just a few hours to finish.  Towards the middle/end of the game there are dozens to hundreds of aliens on the screen at once trying to chew your face off.  Luckily there's a nice variety of weapons and zero reloading.  I'd buy that for a dollar.			",639,175,26,96,62,7,108

												This review originally written on July 2, 2012 on GameFAQs""A fun and entertaining isometric shooter.""Alien Shooter is a top down isometric shooter. You move with the keyboard and fire with the mouse. What I am reviewing is the Invasion Earth edition which is Alien Shooter plus its 2 expansions, Fight For Life and The Experiment, all in one. I will be reviewing all 3 with the 2 expansions having their own small section at the end.GRAPHICS: 8/10This game was released in 2003 and by a small company, so the graphics actually aren't bad. They're bright and colorful and not unpleasant to look at. The only problem is that they use the same tileset for the entirety of the game.SOUND: 9/10The sound is pretty good. The weapons sound right and the monsters make satisfying sounds when they're killed. The music is also real nice and can pump you up when enemies attack.STORY: 4/10There actually is a story in this game, but it's hindered by poor grammar, occasional misspellings, and inconsistent writing. At the start and end of the game there are a few static screens briefly describing the story. At the start of each mission there is a little mission briefing that tells you a little bit about the level and the character's thoughts. The first time you play the game you might bother to read it, but then you beat it and realize it doesn't matter. The main problem is the poor grammar which makes it hard for me to read and take seriously in a commercial game. A small nitpick is the inconsistent writing. Sometimes the writing will go in depth into the description of something inconsequential, but doesn't remain consistent with this style. For example it describes two men getting out of a helicopter and how the blades swoosh their hair. Um, ok? There are no descriptions of the persons themselves or anything else like that so why bother describing something so silly? Oh well, the story isn't important, just shooting aliens.GAMEPLAY: 7/10There are 10 levels in Alien Shooter and your goal in each one is to kill all the aliens, and in some destroy the alien spawners using dynamite. The gameplay is simple and does not change at all. To some it can get repetitive but this is not the first time I played this game and it likely won't be the last. This game is also reasonably challenging on hard. Finally, there is a survival mode which sees how long you can survive using one of the turrets before you die.In most levels there are secrets where you can find things like weapons, upgrades, money, and ammo. Usually they're behind a crack in the wall which you must blow up, but sometimes money is hidden behind walls and you can't see it. You can also destroy certain boxes for cash and money, and enemies drop these at random as well.ENEMIES: 6/10There are literally only 4 enemy types in the entire game. The colors are palette swapped to indicate tougher versions. Later in the game 2 of the enemy types start wearing armor which makes them tougher and allows them to shoot. The enemies, while interesting, aren't original. The small guys are basically Shriekers from Tremors 2, and the taller ones are pretty much the aliens from Aliens. It's still fun to shoot them though!WEAPONS: 7/10There are 9 different weapons with each one getting stronger than the last, and this is my problem. I would've liked the different weapons to have more utility and be useful in certain situations, but for the most part they aren't. Sure rockets and the plasma cannon are good for hordes, but once you get the magma gun there's no reason to use anything else except to save ammo. Some more variety and uniqueness would've been nice.UPGRADE SHOP: 7/10At the start of each level you can use money earned previously to buy new weapons and ammo, as well as upgrades for your character. You can also buy armor, lives, and a few other things. Don't be too eager to buy new weapons and upgrades because you will find some of them in the levels. There are 3 levels of upgrades for your character. The upgrades are HP increase, strength which lets you carry more ammo, speed increase, and accuracy which increases your damage and accuracy. It's not bad how it is now, but it could be better and more complex.LENGTH AND REPLAYABILITYBeating the game on hard is about 2-3 hours depending on your skill and knowledge of the game. There are 3 difficulty levels so you can play on normal first to get the hang of the game then replay on hard for a challenge. To me the replayability is high because over the years I've beaten this game several times.FINAL SCORE: 7/10There's just something about this game that makes it so much fun to play. I've tried playing other games like this such as the Alien Breed trilogy (no relation), but there's something about them that seems off. Maybe it's because in this game there are a hundred aliens swarming at you at once and you mow them all down. This game is very arcadey and I enjoy it for that. There is a demo so give this game a try. If you aren't real into the demo know the game doesn't change or introduce anything new except bigger crowds of stronger enemies.FIGHT FOR LIFE (campaign 2): 6/10This expansion introduces 5 new levels to play. Everything is exactly the same as Alien Shooter but the level layout is of course different. It uses the same tileset and all that. Because there are only 5 levels the difficulty ramps up fast, therefore this expansion is more challenging than the base game. I give it a 6 because it doesn't introduce anything new at all. The “story” is continued but I already discussed the irrelevance of it.THE EXPERIMENT (campaign 3): 7/10This too has 5 new levels, and although it still uses the same tileset, there are 2 new enemy types. There are also a few new rockin' music tracks to listen to. And finally there is a boss monster at the end of the last level (the first boss in the series), and he's hard! This expansion is really hard as a whole as well. You will be tight on money and ammo up until around the end of the last level. My thoughts on the story are the same of what I said for the previous expansion.FINAL THOUGHTSAs I said at the beginning I got the Invasion Earth physical copy which is all 3 of these games. You should be able to find it for pretty cheap. Alternatively you can buy the collection digitally on certain sites. Do not buy from the developer's site as it is grossly overpriced.I overall really like these games and have enjoyed them for years. There are a lot of things they can do better which are addressed in future games but you can't blame these for that too much. A series has to start somewhere and this isn't some AAA developer. If you are into arcade shooters I think you will enjoy these.			",1460,506,45,194,106,13,226

												Alien Shooter is very fun game with many good weapon and enemy variety. Graphics are still look fine to me. This game is a good choice for killing some time. Pros:Very simple game, only 1 button for shooting and just move around.Hords of enemies to kill.Selection of weapons with different specialties.Cons:Cant upgrade weaponsMost of the game is shooting and running backwardsControls need to be refined.Movement of character needs to be refined.Can't switch weapons with mouse wheel, only keyboard numbers.Can get repetitive.As you progress through the levels, you only end up playing with the most powerful weapon.

												This game is not worth the price.It's a very bland, repetetive isometric shoot-em-up.You're a guy fighting aliens with guns. Buy ammo, upgrade a bit, and survive.First, the game is pretty easy. That isn't always a bad thing, but when you are able to explore the map and completely break the balance of the game by just buying another weapon too early, the game needs some help.Second, there isn't a lot of change. I didn't play much of this because I got so bored of fighting the same, retextured buffed up enemies over and over and over again. It's so monotonous.Normally I have more points, but this game has no complexity, so I can't even dive any further. I've already hit the bottom of the barrel.This game is just... just boring. And for 15 bucks... no. (I know it's a pack, but even the other games look to be exactly the same. I wouldn't pay more than 10 bucks for the pack)			",280,71,3,24,14,3,23

												Alien Shooter is a game that will feel eerily familiar if you have played Zombie Shooter already, and that's because they're essentially the same game. There are however some minor differences on account of Zombie Shooter being the later of the two.In this game you can't upgrade your weapons, the enemies are actually less innovative than in Zombie Shooter if you can believe that and the graphics are somewhat more dated.Alien Shooter also suffers heavily from the fact that it uses smaller maps than Zombie Shooter and compensates by introducing infinite enemy spawners which is just a horrible idea.In the end, it's like a slightly crappier version of Zombie Shooter, everything is just a little worse and Zombie Shooter wasn't a very good game to begin with. If someone holds a gun to your head, pick Zombie Shooter over Alien Shooter but if you still maintain your free will, don't bother unless you got it through the Indie Gala in which case you can get an hour or so of fun out of it.

												Alien Shooter does not get cute with its title. You shoot aliens, and lots of them. With the complexity of a well-made flash game, there is really not to this title. You shoot aliens to get cash. You use that cash to buy new weapons and ammo. Sometimes the aliens are yellow, sometimes they are blue, but most of the time they are green. You can choose to set the blood color to red or green, and even password protect so the blood can't be changed back to red. I guess we all have to think of the children.There is an isometric top down view to this game. Move around with WASD, and aim with the mouse. Most of your time is spent dancing around to avoid enemies while holding down on the left mouse button to fire. I felt the aim was not always as tight as I'd like it, but at least your character can pull off some pretty fancy footwork. I don't see a lot of options for customization in this game, so you have the choice between 9 or so different weapons, and a flashlight.The music can pump you up sometimes, really picking up when you're fighting a large horde. The graphics are very representative of a free flash game, and yet this is not a free flash game.If you are in the mood for a mindless shooter, I guess this can be ok if you find it on sale for very cheap. I don't think there is anything here that isn't improved upon in free games. If you are looking to spend some cash, I'd look elsewhere first.Grade: D			",776,367,21,112,93,8,122

												A very basic top down alien slaughtering game. There is really nothing special about this at all, enter one level, kill everything, pull some leavers to turn the lights on and unlock the door, move onto the next. That really is all there is to it. Each level gets harder and harder, well...you just get more and more Aliens thrown at you, but at the end of each level, you just upgrade you weapons and run on unlimited ammo most of the time anyway. Save your money if I were you, alot better games to spend your money and time on.			",1544,456,43,234,159,12,209

Alien ShooterRating: 2 / 10Horrible. That is what the gameplay is.Shoot the green aliens, but don't forget to moonwalk backwardsYou control a character that can shoot and bump into things so things happen. Think of opening doors and flipping switches. But this guy can do more! He can rotate his upper body without moving his lower body. At least in the original, in the revisited he can still do some weird twists but his feet will point more or less into the right direction. In the revisited version however he can moonwalk and move without moving his feet. Floating is perhaps a better word. And often he floats out of the screen and is nowhere to be seen. By you the player that is, the aliens have no problem finding him.So you move your character with the keyboard of right mouse button while shooting with your left. I thought Diablo3 was mindless clicking, well this is his master! Aliens rush at you and you just have to point in the right direction to shoot them while walking backwards. Nothing wrong with that, but if the guy only would walk the way you want him to go! You have to constantly correct his direction. Probably he is busy shooting...You can blow things up. Only don't stand too close or shoot it accidentally and you are dead. At least in the original, in the revisited version it is somewhat better.All the while you can upgrade your armor and stuff you carry. Plenty to be found in those silent buildings.Another thing is that the original has 2 fixed graphic resolutions. Oh well, it's older. But the revisited also has these... Bizar. The graphics are somewhat better but that's about it. Highest resolution is 1024 x 768. How old can you get...In the end this was one of the worst games I played in my life. A mindless alien top-down shooter should not be so hard to make, at least to get the physics right of you puppet. If even that fails, the only option left is to hit the uninstall button.

												Ah yes, Alien Shooter. I remember playing the demo for this thing so long ago...such a classic.So, the story in Alien Shooter is basically nonexistent. You're a special ops person sent by the military to neutralize an army of aliens that got themselves here in a manner similar to the Resonance Cascade in Half Life. Your character fights their way through hundereds and hundreds of the beasties, until you finally bomb the main teleporters they are coming from, and you win. Or do you?The gameplay is some of the most mindless trite ive ever seen. Just hold the left mouse button and dodge incoming fire. It's tedious at first, sure, but once you get a flamethrower that can kill about forty monsters at a time, then it starts getting fun. Inbetween the ten missions, you can buy more weapons and equipment with money you pick up from the field. Yeah, money, just laying around the facility. Then again, what use is money to dead scientists? Even with all the upgrades and BFGs you get, the game still is challenging, with the last level being one of the most tricky levels ive seen in a game.The graphics...eh. It looks like a modern flash game. Then again, it was made in 2003, with not that big a budget it seems...the graphics are okay. Just sprites, but they get the job done.In the end, I give Alien Shooter, a 3/10. It's a fun way to kill about an hour, maybe an hour and a half, but seeing how it comes with Alien Shooter 2, Zombie Shooter, and Alien Shooter Revisited, I think that adds up to about six hours of play, and therefore enjoyment.

												what to mindlessly shoot enemys....hords of enemys then admire vast dead hord that u killed? this is your game mild story but thats not the focus of this game of course! Bottom line a arcade game worth playing once all the way throu ""that is fun"" then playing the challenge mode then beating it ""that is still fun"" then playing the next game in the series. The truh its worth buying and doing everything in the game at least once....a game that is uncomplicated-simple and fun			",122,14,1,21,19,1,32

												Pros:Very simple game, only 1 button for shooting and just move around.Hords of enemies to kill.Selection of weapons with different specialties.Cons:Controls need to be refined.Movement of character needs to be refined.Can't switch weapons with mouse wheel, only keyboard numbers.Can get repetitive.As you progress through the levels, you only end up playing with the most powerful weapon.I only recomend this game when it is on sale.

												The Arcade twin stick shooter that allows you to kill a bunch of aliens for the fun of it.Shoot some aliens! Use awesome weapons! Buy awesome gear. That's the game in a nutshell.This game may look old but that adds to the overall charm of the game, because of the sprites it uses, it really pulls off the feel of an arcade game. This is the type of game I'd throw countless amount of money into just to complete at the arcade if it were there when I was a kid. I remember playing the demo of this many years ago and I've been hooked ever since.It works perfectly on all operating systems that I've tried, including Windows 7 64bit.The only downside to this game is it's age unfortunately, because of it's age, it has lower resolutions to play at and even worse, I can't find a way to make the game windowed in order to compensate for the low resolution it plays at in fullscreen. So it's one thing to keep in mind when getting this game.So all in all, I'd very much recommend this game to everyone. I've loved the whole Shooter series by Sigma so much that I've made videos of each and every one of them. If you don't fancy paying full price for the game, wait until a sale, they are usually at a pretty awesome price so grab it when you can.			",1095,265,59,122,171,5,161

												I'm sad not to be able to ""fully"" recommend this game, it's actually a decent shooter (hence the thumbs up), ""if"" you can get it to work in Windows 8. I've have had some issues/glitches running the game. If you are having issues the only way I've managed to get it to work is by dropping back the resolution to 640 x 480 (avoid the higher res settings). The best thing they could do is hopefully port the game so it can run in an alternate platform (Steam Play/Linux/IOS). If you like shooters get it, it's not a bad game at all just be wary of some of these likely compatibility issues.			",1639,608,63,311,214,13,346

												Cheesy little overhead shooter. As expected if you've ever played any Sigma Team game. Burn some time laying waste to huge masses of enemies, and get a boner when you win.

												Ah yes, Alien Shooter. I remember playing the demo for this thing so long ago...such a classic.So, the story in Alien Shooter is basically nonexistent. You're a special ops person sent by the military to neutralize an army of aliens that got themselves here in a manner similar to the Resonance Cascade in Half Life. Your character fights their way through hundereds and hundreds of the beasties, until you finally bomb the main teleporters they are coming from, and you win. Or do you?The gameplay is some of the most mindless trite ive ever seen. Just hold the left mouse button and dodge incoming fire. It's tedious at first, sure, but once you get a flamethrower that can kill about forty monsters at a time, then it starts getting fun. Inbetween the ten missions, you can buy more weapons and equipment with money you pick up from the field. Yeah, money, just laying around the facility. Then again, what use is money to dead scientists? Even with all the upgrades and BFGs you get, the game still is challenging, with the last level being one of the most tricky levels ive seen in a game.The graphics...eh. It looks like a modern flash game. Then again, it was made in 2003, with not that big a budget it seems...the graphics are okay. Just sprites, but they get the job done.In the end, I give Alien Shooter, a 3/10. It's a fun way to kill about an hour, maybe an hour and a half, but seeing how it comes with Alien Shooter 2, Zombie Shooter, and Alien Shooter Revisited, I think that adds up to about six hours of play, and therefore enjoyment.

												Very good arcade shooter, if you enjoy twinstick shooters, then get this, it'll have you hooked for hours on end shooting alien monsters and turning them into nothing but chucks. Sigma Team are some of the best devs I've ever seen when it comes to twinstick shooters and overall replay value in said gametype, this game alone ended up sucking up at least 100 hours of my time off of steam years ago, maybe even before steam was a thing.Its a solid 8/10 - Could use some polish, but overall its amazing. Also, its remake. Alien Shooter - Revisted. Its a rather good remake, but it seems to not work with windows 8.1, which is odd, but since I got both of these, Alien Shooter 2 Reloaded, and Zombie Shooter in a pack for like 7$ total, it wasn't a big deal to me.
