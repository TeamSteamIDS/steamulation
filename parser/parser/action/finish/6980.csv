												So in Thief, you're a Thief. Despite the misleading title of the game, however, shadows do not actually harm you in any way. Rather, it is advised to stick to the shadows as much as possible. I did not know this, and so had a very troublesome first few hours of gameplay. In Thief, you steal things. That is because you are a thief. When you steal things, they belong to you, and so you can sell them to people and get money to buy other things that make stealing things easier. With this unique system in place, you can achieve a near-constant cycle of owning and disowning various objects in the game world. It is systems like these that contribute much of the immersion to Thief: Not Really Deadly Shadows. You can posess a myriad of useful tools, like a knife. That is sharp, and so it can be used to stab guards, often causing them to die. While to some, like the guards, this may be seen as unhelpful, for a thief, it is actually quite useful. With well thought-out game systems, a very well implemented loot ownership gameplay style, and the ability to own things, I highly recommend this game with something like a 7 or 12 out of 10. Testimonies:""I would own this any day of the week, and you should too""""This is fun""""I love owning things""""I love disowning things""""I would disown this game just to reown it""			",209,14,0,32,11,0,18

												One of the greatest stealth games I have ever played. Not for everyone, because this game is extremely challenging and immersive.Stealth is valued highly and resources are scarce. One of the great features about this game is the Arrows that the player (Garrett) utilizes. You can decide for example, to use one of your precious Water Arrows to remove a light source, allowing you to navigate difficult areas.The Blackjack club Garrett has within his arsenal can kill and must be used from behind to render an opponent unconscious, but beware, for the other NPC's will come looking for them!Killing opponents is a bad idea, knocking them out requires you to hide bodies, light is your enemy and there is quite a good amount of free roam away from the storyline. Breaking into random houses is great fun and if you are careful and plan your robbery ahead you can walk away with a hefty load of swag!In saying this, the storyline is intense, the only weak points coming from the Hammerites lore and the lengthy tutorial at the start of the game, however it can be argued that this tutorial is essential, as the game plunges you immediately into the action.The graphics have aged fairly well and the environments the player finds themselves in are beautiful. There are guides to improve the graphics quality/resolution via the community if you so choose.One of the things that I have heard so many negative comments on regarding Thief: Deadly Shadows is it's difficulty. The difficulty settings in my opinion are quite realistic, considering you do have a magic eye, high tech arrows and an assortment of tools a modern day criminal would die for, coupled with the fact that this game punishes you severely for breaking stealth.I have also heard negative comments about the bugs within the game. These glitches have a minor detrimental impact to gameplay and some are even quite hilarious.Play this and see where Dishonoured got all it's positive traits from. Thief: Deadly Shadows is a far superior game to Dishonoured (I cannot stress that enough) and if you enjoy stealth games, then this is one game you should add to your collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

DISCLAIMER: This is not a first impressions review. It is definitely a current impressions review, and possibly a final impressions review, you know, if the ceiling collapses on my head immediately following my decision to click the ""submit"" button on this review or something unfortunate like that. Deadly Shadows in its vanilla state is great, but not outstanding. If players can overlook the engine's quirks and dated visuals (part of the charm, imo), the moody and at times very unsettling tones allow one to easily lose his/herself in the game world. Those looking for a challenge will be sorely disappointed as even the ""expert"" level AI is downright moronic--and laughably so. Understandly, newcomers might be skeptical about older entries in the series after having played 2014's Thief--a flop of extremely linear proportions and objectively the most stripped-down of the Thief titles (though make sure to play Thief 4's side quests).	Enter the unofficial Sneaky Upgrade patch coupled with the Thief 3 Gold mod, both of which are essential installations which catapult this stealth gem to new heights. With a few simple tweaks, Garrett's once haphazard and risk-free pickpocketing sprees will further require careful timing (as is expected from a master thief), and the City Watch will surely spot his beady lil' eye in the dark before the player can shout ""Azkaban"". 	Prefer the classic Thief HUD? Modders got you covered. Completionists with a taste for the masochistic will rejoice as there are options to hide loot indicators -- or ""sparkles"" which compell the player to carefully rummage through the environment for valuable cups and coinpurses. And if these other tweaks aren't challenging enough, enable Sneaky patch's most punishing AI detection tweaks, roll the game on expert and prepare to be caught and hanged. Deadly Shadows offers a special something for horror fans as well. In a notable chapter toward the end of the game, Garrett will encounter a rather unexpected change in pace and atmosphere as he steps from the shadows into true darkness, the legendary Shalebridge Cradle--a long-abandoned asylum who's walls are coated in a thick, slow-brooding tension inspired by Silent Hill 2. Even by modern standards, the Cradle experience is a deeply unsettling audio/visual masterpiece that sending modern jump-scare titles like Outlast to bed with the lights on.From the perspective of someone who's childhood was largely made up of peanut butter sandwiches with a side of Thief 1 and 2, Deadly Shadows in its patched form is arguably the best and most well-rounded entry in the series and it is now more accessible than it was at the time of its initial release.* QUESTIONS & ANSWERS *Q: So is this game any good or what?Yes. This game is great.Q: Why?I wrote a review that covers some of those details. You can read it above.Q: What if I don't want to read it?There's a TL;DR below. Pretty much what I said in my response to your first question.Q: What if I just can't read like in general?Okay.TL;DR Buy Deadly Shadows. Don't play Deadly Shadows without mods!

												People have said it, but yes, Thief: Deadly Shadows is one of the best stealth games ever to be made. When it came out, the general consensus was that it wasn't as good as the first two Thief games, but I felt it rightly earned its place within the saga. What stands out the most about Deadly Shadows is its immersion. From the beginning I found myself intrigued with the world presented in the game, and the rich lore that serves as the backdrop. Taking place in a dark, Dickensian fantasy world, Deadly Shadows pits the new world order of the steampunk ""Hammerites"" against the ancient and magically luddite-like ""Pagans"". With different factions vying for power and for the services of the main character, Garret, the stage is set for plots, intruige, double-crosses, and a whole lot of sneaking. The story grabbed hold and sunk its (Sometimes terrifying) teeth in deep.I can only hope that the next game in the series, simply titled ""Thief"", will live up to its predecessors; like Deadly Shadows did.

												So i got this game yesterday and waited to today to play it and well, I spent the entire day playing, The game is just so damn addictive, Im a huge fan of stealth games and i remember playing this one when i was only about 6 or 7 years old when it came out.PROSThe atmosphere and darkness: The atmosphere is great if you have the brightness down to 2 or 4, It looks so amazing on 2 but its hardly playable on 2 because you can barely see anything!Quality and Detail: For a game that was developed in 2003 this game sounds and looks pretty great, The AI might not be top quality but it makes up for it in stunning good looksArsenal: Garetts arsenal is very useful and cool, Water arrows for putting out torches and moss arrows that you shoot at metal floors to muffle the sound, Its all very very coolLocations: The locations you are in are very big and offer a long playtime if you want to get all the loot, Unless you go charging in with your dagger, But who wouldent want to lurk in the shadows and knock out guards or stab them in the back?CONSNo autosave: Its because of this ive spent alot of time on it already, I was on the third mission and then got stuck so i had to exit the game and i never saved so it took me awhile to get back to where i was Dumb AI: Now this wont screw up your experiance in the lightest and as i said before this game came out in 2004, But the AI are not very bright, Some will run into doors or if you close a door in they're face while they are chasing you they will just give up the hunt, So they dont pose much of a challenge as they should, They are rather strong however so look outAnd thats my review on Thief: The Deadly Shadows, Overall i would give this game a nice 9/10 because it really captures the essence of stealth and darkness.

												This is a quality 2004 stealth game. You are Garrett and you have to find out what the Prophecies of the Keepers are. Because you are a Master Thief, the keepers use your abilities to steal certain items which involves the prophecy.The game is a first/third person stealth game where you can roam around the city. Steal from houses, pickpocket random people on the street and do whatever you can to get money, between missions. It all feels quite alive in all the small areas of the city and it's always fun to find new routes or hiding places from the guards as you bag all them precious stuff.The people talk to each other, saying Good evening or bugger off as they walk by. Making it feel like a should be.Missions are done in special areas where you can't get in when you are just roaming though.However, I said hiding. Though in this game you can hide from a guard who spotted you in a shadow that is about 1 meter away. The AI isn't the smartest around. Once a guard killed a, what I think was a bandit, and when he walked passed it 15 seconds later, he wondered how there could be a corpse on the ground and directly want to scan the place for enemies. Which in most cases, is the player because well...nothing is as suspiscious as wearing a black hood.But even in missions, I once had an AI regularly walking and suddenly fall to her death, alerting everyone in the area.I think that has to be the worst and maybe the only real problem of this game as the other thing that springs into my mind, is how awfully bad the physics system is. Bad but a good kind of bad. Everytime you will be amazed at how bodies go there way in this game.But other than that, this game is a wonderful game. The story is interesting, the difficulty gradually gets higher as the game goes and the level design is just wonderful. Especially props to 1 certain level which could've been a stand alone horror game. *Shivers*All in all, I recommend this game for it's story, gameplay and level design. The game looks a little old and it's best to download a FOVPatch from the internet, but the value of this game is certainly worth it.			",135,21,3,28,19,0,35

												Rating 8.5/10What is it?First Person Stealth The Good:+ For an older game the graphics hold up incredibly well. + The level design is incredibly well done, the levels are well thought out and fun to explore. Some of my favorite in the series.+ Given a choice of what order to accomplish certain levels. + The stealth in the game is top notch and find just the right balance between realism and fun. For the most part if you get seen or heard it was your own fault. + Great story, dialogue  and voice acting+ Certain levels have a haunting atmosphere, if you love horror certain levels in the game really fit that criteria.+ Great conclusion to a great series. The Bad:- loading times. This game suffered from the 'console sydrome' that was prevelant during that time period and thus levels were split into smaller chunks. Loading time can be a nuasance. - The game's objectives especially outside of main missions are unclear at times. Often times you will be searching for what you need to do when it should be more obvious. ConclusionThis is my favorite game in the series, although most would disagree, I find the game really refined the elements of the series in one cohesive package. I loved the story and the levels and the lead up to the finale. I found the level design in Thief 1 and 2 although good, to be too big for their own good leading to a very disorganized level design.  Thief 3 is a game worth checking out no matter what the price is.  ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												First Thief game i have played, and i just started it before writing this.When i loaded up the game i went straight to the settings to change the resolution, but sadly it didnt make a difference what it was set on, and had no 16:9 resolution options. ""Oh well"" ran through my head, and i started up a new game.Entering my first Thief level was like visiting an alien planet. I was confused about controls, things seemed wonky, guards pathfinding was a joke to me, hiding in a sliver of a shadow (in plain sight) wasnt right to me, and then... well... I went sneaking like a snake through Lord Ember's castle, knowing only of his family dispute and a valuable gem that was kept in the basement. When i first got there, i hid behind a cart for 20 minutes wondering if i could ever move and if i did, what friggin button threw a flashbang. After mashing my entire keyboard and deducting that it was the 'I' button, i moved on in wonder and awe of the Amnesia-esque enviroment that surrounded me. Slowly learning the ropes, i died to a guard carrying a torch, when i thought i could distract him with a loaf of bread to the face, lesson learned.Every guard was a puzzle to solve, and every treasure was a wonderful reward. Sneaking around in this game has been the most fun and soul-searching experience i've ever had, and i've only completed the first level. I havent even touched on the ""open"" world yet.While the graphics are outdated and there are some issues with the settings, it still made me enjoy myself. Minor bugs, yes.Too many loading screens, yes.I've heard tale of a mod that fixes those things, but i havent tried it yet.My conclusion: Definitely worth every penny.I look forward to beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game.

Posted: October 11, 2014
												I write this on the basis of not having played previous Thief games in the series. However, Thief: Deadly Shadows proved itself a firm favourite and true classic on my list (I owned the game on disc when it was first released but had to re-purchase on Steam so it was compatible with my current PC). It's true that the graphics are now very obsolete compared to more modern titles - but it has been around for over ten years! - and I still have fond memories of exploring, stealing, sneaking, and eavesdropping. Garrett is perhaps one of the most memorable game characters and superbly voice-acted by Stephen Russell. Garrett's real strength lies, not in combat, but stealth, utilizing the shadows, and on occasion render troublesome guards unconscious with the blackjack. He's also in possession of dagger, although players favouring more a killing nature doesn't really have much bearing on the gamelay as it did in, say, Dishonored. The levels themeselves are extensive and credible; compulsive explorer players may desire to linger and search these sandbox-style maps to the full in order to collect 100% treasure. Such ill-gotten valuables are then sold to a fence and money can purchase useful tools and items to help Garrett in his adventures: flashbombs can be deployed in sticky situations, water arrows extinguish torches, oil flasks can cause guards to slip, noise arrows distract and misdirect guards....and many others handy for certain tight situations. The City itself is divided into several districts and offers a few (but not many) distractions from the main story; regarding side-quests, Deadly Shadows isn't on par with Deus Ex: Invisible War (even though they shared the same engine) and Garrett can only break and enter into about a dozen buildings, only a couple of which contain prized treasures. One particular level stands out as a ground-breaking piece of atmospheric story-telling: the chilling Shalebridge Cradle was regarded as a tidemark by Thief fans and became famous within gaming circles. The hairs on my neck stood on end thoughout the entire level! But there are a couple of niggles: one of which that Garrett can't swim despite it being possible for him to fall into water proved a frustrating possibility. With later games catering to more aquatic-capable characters, such as Deus Ex, Assassin's Creed II onwards, GTA San Andreas, Dishonored,  even the recent Thief title,(sometimes swimming was actually an option or requisite to a particular mission in these games), here Deadly Shadows stumbles on the credible side. Alternatively, I would have preferred an 'invisible forcefield' keeping Garrett safe on the pier. Admittedly, not entirely plausible for world immersion, but less frustrating. Another annoying gameplay issue would be broadhead arrows: these things should be lethal - yet, once alerted, sometimes it took about four of them to kill a guard. I can understand one wound enraging an enemy, but surely a second would cause them to have second thoughts and retreat hastily from the scene? It would have been more fun and plausible having a bloodied guard stumbling about alerting colleagues, forcing Garrett into hiding once more. The main story itself concerns an imminent period of darkness about to engulf the City. It's up to Garrett to explore locations in a bid to uncover clues and fulfil counter-measures in order to prevent this from happening. Cutscenes are excellent affairs explaining the plot as it thickens and motives behind each mission. Garrett himself (Stephen Russell) regales the player with a determination, as if talking to himself but steadying the nerves.Although an old game, it's one that has aged well for veteran gamers with fond memories, and guaranteed to return now and again to sample such a fine brew.

												After only 42 hours of gameplay I have conquered the final chapter of the Thief trilogy.(I'm not counting the fourht one because Looking Glass wasn't involved) I  have explored every nook and cranny, knocked out or murdered everione in the city,(or in most cases both) stolen everything that fit inside of my magical, Mary Poppins pockets,(aside from the bag of coins the crazy old widow needed to live, I mean, I may be a thief, scoundrel, rapscallion, and quite probably a serial killer, but I'm not a bad guy...) and smashed, burned, blown up or sunk to the bottom of the ocean everything that didn't. I have fought and vanquished the best and brightest of the local law enforcement, defeated fanatic cultists from two opposing sides of one very dysfunctional religion, purged the city of its infestation of undead creatures, crushed hulking golems of stone into nothing more than dust, to be carried away with the wind and forgotten forever, listened in on every private conversation, and crawled all over every inch of every brick or stone wall in the city like an insane, murderous spiderman with sticky fingers.(pun not intended, but enjoyed nevertheless) I feel a sense of accomplishment having completed the series, but also a sadness and longing because I know that Looking Glass is no more and Sony now owns Garrett the Master Thief's soul, and copyright. I only hope that Sony will one day let him die with dignity, and then toss his lifeless body into a cuddle puddle in a dark corner just like he did with so manyguards who had the poor fortune to be working when he was stealing everything they were supposed to protect. I will miss the Master Thief, even now I find myself dragging out this review, because once I hit ""post"" I know he'll be gone forever,(or at least until I upgrade to a pc that can actually run Thief 4) but I must sleep now, for it is 4:30 am and I have to be up around... let's say 1 pm... you know, for lunch. So I give this game 42/10 one point for every hour of murderous, theiving, spidermanly joy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thief: Deadly Shadows is the final installment of the original trilogy of Thief games. It runs on a new engine from the previous two games, and so things work a little differently, this time around.The first thing you'll probably notice is the updated graphics, and the second is the fidgety movement. Deadly Shadows has the ability to be played from a third-person perspective, but unlike, say, Oblivion, it seems as though the third-person control was built *first*. As a result, Garrett jitters a bit when starting and stopping movement, and you can see your hands and legs as they actually are, and not, like with many first-person games, as two sets of limbs apparently growing directly out of your face. Of course, you get used to this after a couple missions, though you won't necessarily get used to occasionally seeing things in your hands at the side of your screen when you turn too quickly.I jumped several times when carrying bodies, all the way from the first mission to the last.There are ten missions this time around, as opposed to Thief Gold and Thief II's fifteen a piece. To make up for this, The City serves as a free-roamy hub area where you can thief around for additional loot, sell whatever loot you're carrying, and buy supplies for future missions. There are also main story objectives to complete, along with optional side quests should you seek them. Missions themselves are shorter, owing to the smaller level designs - undoubtedly a result of the engine change and graphical makeover. The relatively small levels are then chopped into even smaller segments with load screens in the middle. While it's, again, something you'll easily get used to, it does occasionally make building layouts seem a bit odd when thought of as a whole.The enemy AI has been improved. Guards will notice bloodstains on the floor, doors which should or shouldn't be open, and other guards missing from their posts. On normal difficulty, however, Deadly Shadows is much easier than Thief II (which was, in turn, far easier than Thief Gold). Series veterans looking for a challenge will absolutely want to play through on hard or expert. The difficulty of levels never really increases much over the course of the game (indeed, the toughest level for me was the third or fourth one I played). Though later in the game the hub world does take a couple difficulty spikes, by the final third I was carrying the maximum amount of all available equipment, with more than enough cash left over to replace anything I might use by the end.Speaking of the end, all difficulty aside, the finale felt appropriate enough to earn a mention, here. The final level is a perfect fit for a game about burglary, and the final sequence is a perfect fit for this specific game about burglary. Even the ending cutscene wraps the series up nicely, allowing me to walk away feeling very pleased with my time spent with the series as a whole.There are some other notable differences, here and there. There are now factions, so you can ally yourself with or against the Pagans and/or Hammerites. Levels now have loot-collecting requirements based on the difficulty you are playing on. Darkness is blueish, rather than stark black, so you can see what you're doing easier. Also it looks prettier, if you're into that (especially with the shafts of moonlight which pour in from any window they can). Lockpicking is now a little more involving. You have to get closer to knock people out, now. Stabbing requires closer quarters, as well, as Garrett now carries a dagger instead of a sword. And there's now a large emphasis on the Keepers' use of glyphs, which seem a little out of place when there was no mention of them even being a thing in previous installments.The differences take some getting used to, but I urge you to keep playing until you do. Thief: Deadly Shadows is a worthy addition to the franchise, and once you're steady on your thief legs it's every bit as fun as the previous games. So get settled in, plug in your favorite pair of headphones, and let's take a walk on the Thief side.			",401,187,13,44,46,6,60

FIRST THINGS FIRST: Get the SNEAKY UPGRADE. It takes this game from being ""pretty good"" to ""I love this game"". Install T3 Gold, Texture Pack, and the Minimalist Upgrade. Then tweak it to your liking from there. Seriously, this mod almost changes the game, it's amazing. The biggest feature is the removal of levels being split up, and is hugely beneficial. It adds widescreen support, custom resolution, bug fixes, FOV tweaking, all that. Get it.Steam says half an hour played, but that's because I play the game with the Sneaky Upgrade. All in all, about 20 hours for me to finish. Thief 3 is a real mixed bag: you've got fantastic level design, amazing lighting and atmosphere; then you've got awful, clunky controls, generally smaller levels, and a tedious hub between missions. Not even to mention the ugly UI if you don't use SU with the minimalist mod.Let's start with the negatives: coming immediately from T1/T2, I can all but guarantee you will not like T3. I didn't. It took me a while to get over the differences in character movement: T3 uses a system where you're actually tied to how Garret's body would move. In theory, that's great, and very immersive. In practice, it's annoying. If you want to take a step forward, you've got to move enough for Garret to place his foot. I'm finding it difficult to describe, and it's definitely one of those ""you just have to play it to understand."" However, after a couple hours, it didn't bother me at all. I was used to it.Then there's The City: Again, on paper, really, really awesome idea. Some of my favorite levels from the last two games were the ones set in the big areas of the City. T3 said ""let's give players the ability to explore the City in an open-ended fashion"", and did so. But, because this game was developed for the Xbox at the same time, the City levels are more like a couple streets. They're extremely small and constrained, and don't really feel like a city. The biggest problem is respawning guards; it's pretty much impossible to take out every guard in a section. You'll black jack one, carry the body to a corner and dump it, then turn around, and his replacement is already there. I liked exploring the City early on, but as the game goes on and you keep coming back, I found it to be irritating and wanted to speed through it. Even though you unlock more areas and additional wrinkles get added to make it a bit more interesting later on.Now for what I loved: This is a Thief game. A classic Thief game. So, what you're getting is an amazing, dark story, shrouded in deep, mysterious lore; you're getting incredible atmosphere; and finally, you're getting flat-out amazing stealth gameplay. Thief is one of those magical games that really suck you in with immersion: I felt like I was Garrett, I felt like I needed to swipe as much loot as I could per level; I actually caught myself attempting to peak around corners on my monitor while playing, I caught myself shrinking down in my chair to squeeze into that small, shadowed spot behind a pillar.The basic gameplay for T3 is this: You enter an area at night time. Garrett has various arrows and gadgets to facilitate his stealing. There are guards patrolling, and you must steal something (along with everything else that's shiny and not nailed down), or accomplish an objective. You do this by crouching, moving through dynamic shadows (that look absolutely amazing), clubbing guards in the back of the head with your blackjack, and using your gear to get around even sneakier. The AI for this game is generally intelligent; snuff out a torch with a water arrow, and the patrols will notice, and be on edge; leave a door open, same deal. This is my first review, and I feel like I'm rambling and not really getting anywhere. The bottom line is: Play T1/T2 first. Take a break, then play T3 with the Sneaky Upgrade. Take some time to get used to its quirks, problems, and changes. Pretty soon you'll be utterly sucked in to the weird, dark world that Garrett lives in.			",67,11,0,3,3,0,2

												Pros: The sound/light-driven stealth is in some ways improved, with dynamic shadows, AI noticing pickpocketing, open doors and the like. The graphics are great. Some improvements via streamlining. Wall climbing gloves are fun, if not without irritants.Cons: Takes a lot of cues from Deus Ex(that the developers had been doing before this), and the two franchises do not go well together. The open world aspects don't fit. Levels are smaller. Plot remains vague and unengaging for most of the duration.It's pretty good, if bland, since it doesn't choose either Thief or Deus Ex, and ends up somewhere in the middle between the two. My recommendation: Most stealth fans will enjoy it, but purists may want to stick with the first two.			",64,2,0,0,0,0,1

												I had a blast. Playing this game makes me sad because stealth games just aren't this good anymore. The game is both challenging and feels rewarding when you complete a job. Each mission is like a small open world and it is up to you to explore each level and figure out the best ways around the guards. The game shows little to no mercy when telling you where the item you need to steal is. This is up to you to figure out and it can get frustrating sometimes but it is just so rewarding to finially weave your way through the level and finially claiming what you must steal. The only complaint I have about this game so far is the dialouge for the common guard is a bit cheesy and stupid. Also, the guards are absolute morons. they have no peripheral vision and they do not react if you shoot an arrow and miss. However sometimes the guards can be smart especially if you accidentally move into a lighted spot and one happens to spot you a mile away. This game has about 30 hours of gameplay, and that is not filled with cutscenes and trial and error moments. It is actual gameplay. Overall it is a great game and I find myself addicted. One of the best stealth games I've ever played.			",103,5,0,21,3,0,11

												The third game in the Thief series provides for a lengthy yet entertaining experience. There are some compromises between this game and previous offerings as a result of the engine choice (no underwater areas, rope arrows, etc) but I found it to be a worthy successor to the overall series. The hub world was a nice touch too and provided some interesting distractions in-between missions.			",217,103,1,22,12,4,23

Posted: December 17, 2016
												I didn't actually care about the Thief series when I got this, nor did i really want to get the game. It was recommended to me, and for whatever reason I got it. The fact that I waited two or three weeks to even touch the game, after buying, reflects how I felt about it.(P.S, pardon my spelling skills).Interestingly, when I did finally boot it up, I emediatly got a vibe that I had never really gotten from another game- and I have played alot of games (Ive beaten DaggerFall for ex). The vibe was somewhat alienating, from the main menu's ominous  esteem, the organinc font for ""Theif"", and the tutorials obscure method of setting the scene- I was not sure what I was getting into. Plus the pause menu was funny.Unfortunatley, the tutorial of the game made the whole thing feel dumbfounding, with extremely easy motives and wonkey elements. Because of this, I put the game down for about a month, I only came back to it because I was bored and remembered that the game was somewhat intriguing. Glad I did comeback, as this time I was a little more attune to the controls and had somewhat of a drive to play the game. The tutorial ended and I quickly noted that the main character was fun to use, and I loved his voice. personally that was the first thing I appreciated, the characters charm. But I was met with a new mission, inside a manor which was a family establishment. It was big.I instantly got lost, the corridors, the gaurds, the lights, all of it was turning me about- But in a good way. I learned that every element, every corner, all of the maps physic, had a purpose- and I would need to comprise them into my own favor. After a hour I had completed the mission, and exhausted all my equipment in doing so. Yes an hour long, I had been spending so much time waiting and tiptoeing, or using the blackjack on all foes. In truth, i was kinda scared, because i felt so vulnerable, and i was invigerated by this feeling. (even dark souls dosn't make me feel this weak).After that mission, I knew I was hooked, Every inch of the game so far had been thought out intently, inteligently, and fairly. Failure was my own fault, the Ai (though kinda dumb) prooved I had to think a little extra, and the evironment was appropriate to it's own game world.I loved it, and I was ready for the next mission. Which Garret (main Character) desscribes as his house... house? okay, sure. I start up and sneak around and go through a couple rooms, steal from my land lord, nice. Outside I go, and- To the store... lol wut.The thing was, i didn't relize it was a world hub. I assumed I was just on a unique level. When more and more I got to move about, -it finally dawned on me that i was indeed in a hub, and my love for the game was intensified. This game has a meenigful way of making zones that respect each other and allucate factional use amazingly. For example, groups will hone an area, maybe spread their presence throughout the game. Gaurds walked about, poor folk, rich folk who you could pit pocket, it was all an emersive realm and i was blown away by how much it all made sense.To be fair, i didn't know you could pitpocket, I know- its a stealth game, your a thief, but i would just bash people on the head with the blackjack and take it off the ground. Lol.Anyway, I was greatly pleased with the game and apptly entitled it one of my favourite games. It would however, continue to earn my respect, one of the reasons why was the introduction to supernatural elements (for me it was an introduction as it is my first thief game). I can remeber being infront of the Church, and I skipped pass a guard to check a dead end. I was caught off gaurd to hear a really raspy voice asking to ""Kill"" people. In the dark i couldn't really see it, but sure enough, some creature was in a jail cell. I opened it up, to which the creature was revealed to be a fish man, like an atlantic person. I laughed it off as a joke or easter egg, yet i could not shake the feeling of ""beyond"" intitys.I also rember a conversation by two street goers, talking about a zombie quaritine. I took it as ""Dumb old timey superstition"" character types and ignored it, (which is a little unfair, being supersticious myself). I completely learned that monsters did exist in this game world however, and was happy that it did come true, as secretly i desired it would. To be fair, I could go on and on and on. But Really i just wanted to share my first experiences and how i almost never got to enjoy what is easly my second most favourite game of all time. I Recommend it, and im off to play the original games.Favourite mission: Manor on the island.Favourite faction: Hammerites or Keepers, can't say. ",29,6,0,10,0,0,1

												Great third addition to the Thief series. Instead of simply going on to the next mission after completing one, you go back to the city. Here you can do everything from purchasing arrows and equipment, to stealing from the citizens, to picking on the guards.Plus, the story is a bit more open. Not sure if this is a spoiler or not, but at one point you can choose whether to become friendly toward the Hammerites, or the Pagans, which affects the rest of the game after that.Instead of a sword, you have a dagger. Makes backstabbing much easier.No rope arrows, but you can eventually purchase climbing gloves. These are AWESOME, if you can figure out how to use them. :DOil vials. Can be ignited to make a temporary, impassible wall of flame, or can be used to make guards slip, slide, and fall down elevator shafts, if you know what you're doing. Awesome.The ability to go 3rd Person in the game is interesting -- at first it detracted from what I was used to in the Thief series, but I quickly got over it.You also now have the ability to press up against a wall, suck in your gut, and thus become almost invisible in a dark hallway. Reeeeaaaally creepy putting this to the test for the first couple times.Lockpicking is a little more immersive and realistic, as well.Needs some tweaking to make it work on newer machines (opening cutscene is an instant crash for me). One thing that sucks is loading screens within missions. But all of these issues are easily fixed. Just look up some mods for Thief: Deadly Shadows and you'll be set for an amazing time! :)9/10. Would be 10/10 if there were rope arrows and no need for mods to patch problems. Still, WAY better than the new ""THIEF"" knockoff (aka Dishonored 2).			",122,9,0,9,3,0,13

												You are Garrett, you are a thief. You steal for a living. This incredible skill you have, will make your life quite complicated. This is the third game in the series.First off. Don't let the hours I spent on this game fool you. I have played this game so many times, countless of hours. I just have not owned it on steam until recently. I bought it again, because I think it is that great. Let's see when I have more time to return to it..... Just to make it clear, I am a great fan of thief. I have played all the games, and countless of fan-made missions. I am eagerly awaiting the new game (even though I am also a little bit worried about it). I have also played the entire dishonored game plus all DLCs, which I consider to be the best spiritual successor of the thief games up to date. I love stealth games, and I consider Deus Ex (and mark of the ninja) to be great titles as well, which I have all completed.So, the game:There was one thing that this game did really well: atmosphere. I love the other thief games, but I think this game was outstanding in this area, and in a way, that is what thief is all about.At the beginning, this game was not too well recieved. I think that is because of two things:It was made with a console in mind, and it was compared to one of the greatest PC games of all time: thief 2. Trying to be as good as that game, is no easy task. But it actually think it did rather well in my mind. (Also, it was made by an entirely different game studio because ""looking glass"" went bust...) The other problem was that consoles in those days had quite limited resources, so areas could not be very large, making the game feel small with many loading screens. Now the PC did not have that problem, but the game was designed for the console, so....But there the problems end in my mind. Because the rest of the game is really very good. And if this title would not be compared to its predecessors, I think everbody would agree it is a great game in its on right. There where some changes, but I think the essential ""thief"" was still in this game, and it was well made.Graphically, it was quite a thing when it came out. It was one of the first games to use dynamic shadows, and it required quite a PC to run well. Today that won't be a problem, but the game still looks and feels great, because the atmoshpere and design is that good. It serves the purpose very well even though you don't have the most amazing latest graphics. For example, Deus ex (invisible war) was made with the same engine, and that game has not aged well. I think it is because the art and the vision was so much better in thief than deus ex, so you forgive the graphics in thief - they are not in your way as much. But in deus ex the graphics turn you off a bit. A great examples that it is not always about the technical stuff, but how that media is used, and in thief it is used well.It used to be a problem to run on modern PCs, but I find that this steam version works well, and there is also a lot of patches and support from the community that makes this games run better. There is an update that makes the game look better for example.But what the game did even better was sound. You had to listen. Where are the enemies? Do I sound too much myself? The music is sparse but just perfect. The sounds from the environment creates a great atmosphere. And sometimes the void of sounds was creppy too. Also the chattering that the NPS are making are fun to listen too. The original thief perhaps was better in this sense, but this game still kept some of that humor very well.The story and levels in this game is also very good. And long, really long. You won't complete this game quickly.The game is also one of the most scary games I have ever played. Not because of the monsters, or cheap scares, but because the atmosphere is that good, and because of the ""uknown"". Thers is one level in this game I think should go to history as the most atmospheric level ever in a game. If you have played this game I think you know what I am talking about. The first time I played that level... I have never enjoyed and suffered so much at the same time, playing any game - I wanted to go on, and quit at the same time...You can play this game in third person if you like, but that is just wrong. This game should be played in first person, or it is just broken and less immersive. This is a game where you need patience, perception and wits. Feeling vulnerable is half the charm of the game, waiting in a shadowed corner hoping the ""whatever"" won't discover you. (this game was also new in a way that the NPCs could carry light sources, lighting up areas that previously were dark, making the games more interesting)This is not a fighting game, you are a thief hiding in the shadows, where you are quite powerful. I miss games like these. Let's hope the new thief game is ok. But the 3 thief games that exist are still alive and worth it, with tons of modding and fan-made missions. And there is also dihonored of course...This is one of those games you should complete if you considerd yourself a PC-gamer.			",149,34,4,16,9,1,4

												A hardcore Splinter Cell fan, such as myself, willlove this. Reminding alot from it, but set in aMedieval or Victorian-like age with both electricity,magic and beasts.Gameplay:It's mission based but also played in open world.You are playing in a city divided into areas whereyou can freely walk in between them as you progressthe main story. You will find sidequests by doingyour own exploring. All parts of town have theirstores where you can either buy equipment or sellyour loot.Music:The music blends in with where you are and whatyou're doing, well enough that you don't thinkabout it that much, just the way it should bemade for a stealth game to not steal your focus.Sound and Voices:There are really funny voices and conversations heldbetween people. This works excellent to fill thetime you sometimes have to wait, before making yourmove. The monsters voices are equally as good butinstead made frightening. Some monsters havevery heavy footsteps along with it, to make themeven more scary, while you are standing close pushedup in a dark corner.Graphic:Alot of shadows, since it's always night time.The monsters appearance are better than in most horrorgames out there.Movement:If you come from the Splinter Cell franchise, you willadapt to these controls in no time, it uses quite thesame basic moves with both more and less from it.The game gives you the option of switching betweenfirst and third person viewing perspective, which isa really useful feature in certain situations to makethings easier.Story:The game starts off slowly, with you doing some regaularthefts, before escelating into a much darker tale.Set for you to collecting necessary artifacts, in orderto rid the evil. Along the road you will constantly haveto deal with various groups of people, some are more orless friendly, depending on how you treat them.Bug and drawback listing:*Movement suffers alot from bugs and will be the mainfactor in the game ruining your stealth.The most problematic one being where you in mid airwill freeze in a hovering position, after having jumpedagainst an object to climb. The way to fix this is doneby drawing an arrow quickly, by just tapping it, so youdon't have to shoot it.*You can easily get stuck if jumping and landing downon narrow areas.*Climbing up and walking on ledges is very clunky. Youwill keep falling off, as you for unknown reason ispushed out and prevented to pass by invisible barriers.As soon as you start slipping from a ledge, you can'tsave yourself, you are guaranteed to fall down.*Crouch toggling has a bad registering. *Candles may sometimes keep illuminating after being putout and in rare cases even be unquenchable.*The crosshair of the bow is not depicting the correctx axis trajectory of it's arrow, you will have to aimto the side of it instead.*Objects and bodies on the ground can spasm out at randomif coming into contact with another object, this willof course alert any nearby enemy and ruin your stealth.*Certain none special loot on mission levels don't shine.This makes a 100% loot run a living hell, forcing youto check every single small object on the map to makesure it's either loot or junk. Keep lifting and puttingdown unneeded objects will ruin stealth.*Some of the loot are unecessary hidden on top of book-shelves high above your field of view, unless you jump.Again, this is something that will ruin your stealth.*Noise-maker arrows are not working that well.The enemies are programmed to prioritize where the soundemerged from, the source, so they will often instead runwhere you sit rather than to where you shot the arrow.This is because the noise starts as soon as the arrowleaves your bow instead of triggering on impact.Conclusion:Despite having its heavy movement bugs, I highly recommendit as long as you're not too much of a perfectionist.You will have to endure some frustration with it nowand then, but I think it's worth it to experience whatthis game offers in fun and creepy level.

												I've finished this game 5 times and I still think it's currently the best Thief game. I've finished all at the time of the release but Thief 1 and 2 are now just too old and Thief 4 is just too ""modern"". It has the best storytelling and the best environments and the City. It doesn't overstay it's welcome (unlike 2 where the last mission can take you 3-4 hours) And this is the game which contains the best mission from all of the Thiefs. Really you should just play it if you like stealth games.			",96,40,1,8,7,0,4

												Good stealth games are hard to come by, at least the hardcore ones, but this one does not disappoint.The plot is really well presented, you don't know much of it at the start, but as you play it the more engaged in it you get. It starts with a faction asking you for help (not willingly) to retrieve a certain artifact from a church of the religious Hammerites. At first Garrett, the main character, not wanting to get involved in any political game refuses, but then thinks of all the good stuff he could ""borrow"" while he's there... What starts simple, gets a little more complicated later on. Not spoiling anything, let's just say that it is somewhat unexpected (but in a good way!) and surpsisingly scary sometimes (yes ""The Cradle"", I'm talking to you).The game encourages you to really sneak around and not be detected, since a confrontation doesn't end well for the player in most cases. But don't think that this is an unforgiving game, as the game provides the player with a good variety of tools to make all the sneaking around possible. For instance, there is the Blackjack that can be used to knock enemies out silently, there's the Water Arrow which is used to extinguish fire based light sources from a distance creating areas of darkness, the Moss Arrow that is used to create a grassy spot where it isn't noisy to walk on, or the option to simply grab something fom the environment and throw them to lure enemies away. And if you screw things up, there are also the ""escape"" tools as well, like the Flashbang, that blinds the enemy giving you time to hide again, the Oil Flasks in which the enemies can be slowed down in case of pursuit by sliping on them (or to be set on fire if shot with a Fire Arrow, creating a true firewall), and so on. And if you really need to fight, you have your bow (which can kill the enemy instantly, but only if he/she is not aware of your presence) and dagger (you can also backstab unaware enemies with it), which is possible to guess, isn't very effective in a direct assault on armored sword wielding angry guards (but possible to beat with the help of some Health Potions)With all of the tools in the game, it is even possible to beat the game without a single confrontation, lethal or non-lethal. These items give you a nice balance in the game, making every mission possible to be approached a different number of ways.The game can be played in a first person perspective, which is more immersive but a little more problematic, or in a thid person perspective, that makes the game easier since you can take a peek at corners without moving for instance.As I stated before, the first person perspective can be a little frustrating, a good example of this is when you lean: the purpose of this is to be able to look from the safety of the shadows without compromising yourself too much, in previous installments of the series, this manouver was one of the most important of those games, it was easy and quick to use, in this game however instead of the character just leaning his head out of cover like it was implied by the movement of the camera in the other games (there was no third person perspective in those), here the character literally places himself to the side really slowly, which compromises you instead of giving you an edge on the enemies.In fact, it can be dangerous to use sometimes, as it can make you fall from a ledge if you're trying to lean near one for instance. So this kinda forces you to use the third person perspective a lot more than you could wish for.But this isn't something that can take you away from the game, it's a minor inconvenience that doesn't break the game. You can face a wall and then put your back on it if you think an enemy is going to walk by TOO close to you (can be a life saver) and the movement modes give you more strategy options: you can run, walk crouch, and sneak, each one presents a different speed and noise, so choosing carefully how to approach a place or enemy is always a good plan.The AI can be unforgiving, or just plain stupid. Sometimes it will chase you relentlessly for a long time, and sometimes it will give up at the first corner. At least it is good to be surprised sometimes and have to adapt to a certain situation. It is just weird (but necessary in a certain way in this genre) that the enemies see you and may even engage in combat, but later forget that you were there when you hide (""It was probably just my imagination"").The game takes place in The City (that's the name presented by the game), and it is kind of a free opened world. ""Kind of"" because of the engine limits, since the game can't handle large areas, there are a lot of transition places which requires the game to stop and load content, breaking the pace of the game, and making it really annoying when you are just trying to explore. The missions take place in separate places of the city, and can only be accessed once, so you can't visit the mission areas prior to reaching them in the story.Graphically, the game looks really good for its time, great particle effects lighting effects and shadow projections (which you can use to see the enemy coming or the opposite). There are a few problems with colision detection and you can get stuck sometimes requiring you to reload the game in a previous save slot, but thankfully, that's really rare (unless you want to climb everywhere).The sound in this game is great, the musics, the ambient and the voice acting are terrific (and comical sometimes as intended). People talk about you in the streets, or think out loud that they must be seeing ghosts and so on, and that's all very convincing.The game is pretty long, without taking consideration the times you will reload and try again going through a certain spot or the load times themselves, so it provides a good ammount of time of entertainment.In the end, even lacking a few things that made its antecessors great (like the Rope Arrow), Thief Deadly Shadows still greatly succeeds in delivering a solid stealth gameplay and at the same time gives the player liberty to approach the tasks at hand many ways differently (but that doesn't mean without a little punishment) giving the game a good replay value. And with its lenghty campaign, it will certainly have you immersed in its world of intrigues and surprises for a good (really good by the way) time.			",236,35,2,25,9,1,28

												Not gonna lie. For eight bucks this game is a classic gem. I never played it while it was in its prime on the original xbox, but playing it now on the PC in 2016 is making me wish that I hadn't waited. For a classic game, it uses shadows, noise, and other tricks of light/sound brilliantly and has a better sneaking system than some games today. (*cough* SKYRIM). For 8 bucks there really isn't a reason to get this game.			",30,7,0,4,1,0,9

												Thief: Deadly Shadows is definitely the weakest addition to the Thief series, as it catered for the broadened player base as part of it’s developed for the Xbox console, making it nowhere near the level of its predecessor, but still a solid stealth game and probably one of the lasts of its genre. Despite that, the developers have put in an effort into recreating the world of Thief.It takes what was best from Dark Project and adds a new layer of surreal horror to it that results in one of the most widely playable games yet. The setting is familiar to the first instalment and the story becomes similarly weird and mysterious. The controls have improved over Metal Age and enable a flawless exploration of the world. The story is what really tops the two previous titles.However, the dated graphics engine means that loading screens are plentiful and levels are small. It's been streamlined for the Xbox crowd and the consoles limitations and features a bunch of nonsensical elements which were not present in previous Thief games. Getting wedged in the scenery is not a rare event and the rag-doll physics are lazy and unnatural compared to what they should have gone with - good animations. The game now uses a ‘City-hub’ rather than the assumed natural progression between missions as seen in the previous titles. Deadly Shadows is a lot more linear, and suddenly rope/vine arrows and scouting orbs don't exist, and Garrett has forgotten the ability to swim as he dies the instant he touches water. The combat system as expected is not one of the Thief’s strong points, and it would be safer altogether, to just avoid an enemy in the first place.Die-hards fans might consider it a disgrace to the Thief series, and as a whole, it simply does not live up to the legacy, but despite all of this, the game does deserve credit for maintaining the Thief atmosphere and keeping the series going.

												Ahh, this game. It's a great stealth game. One of the best, really. Its got stellar stealth effects. Light, sound, it all has an effect. Its fun using your wide array of items to either kill or knock out an enemy, or sneak by unseen. The bow is paricularly lovely in this game. The water arrows you use to put out torches are particularly unique. The city is pretty nice, even though it's small, it still manages to feel alive somehow. The areas are fun, filled with different paths you can take to complete your objectives. Which path will you take through the shadows? You choose. And its really fun sneaking around in the shadows. To me personally, this is one of the few stealth games where it isn't like "" I'm right in front of your face and you still don't see me, you stupid gaurd ? "" And while THAT much is great, there IS a reason for it. Because if you run this on windows 10 the game is so effing dark that you probably see as much as the gaurds you sneak past can. On windows 10 the brightness toggle doesnt work. And it starts off very dark. And there isn't a thing you can do about it. It's very frustrating. But as far as I know this problem is only on windows 10. Aside from this glitch, the game falls flat in a few areas. Even though this is a stealth game, the combat should be noted. It's awful. If you get caught and are engaged in combat, you might as well just retry from check point. I doubt this will matter to most people, but it still needs to be noted. Aside from that, they don't tell you how valuable resources are. They give you something likw 20 arrows, and you have to save them and not use them in the first mission, as if you spend all the money you make from the supposedly "" rare "" object you steal in the first two missions gets you enough money for around 17 arows. Yeah. Anyways, this is still a really good game, and an amazing stealth game. Windows 10 version: 6/10, Every other version: 8.5/10.			",25,2,0,8,0,0,6

												I'm an unabashed long-time fan of the Thief series. I was excited to hear my favorite video games were getting a third installment. Then I played this...The first time I played through this game, at every turn I sighed and thought bitterly about how such and such was different from this or that in the first two games. And almost every instance was different for the worse, not better. I finished the game with an unpleasant taste in my mouth. I've played it again before writing this review, this time deliberately putting the high expectation bar out of mind. The result has been a more enjoyable experience. It's a shame but I suppose what I'm saying is that I enjoyed this game more when I lowered my expectations for it, ahaha. NOT RECOMMENDED.The gameplay is just... poorer. It's obviously geared towards facilitating console play, using a newly added third-person perspective, adding a ""loot glint"" sparkle on lootable items, etc. This has several drawbacks. 1) It decreases immersion, but I admit that is a subjective complaint. Maybe you don't think so. 2) It allows you to ""cheat"" by pivoting the camera around corners to scout rooms. That's just bad. On the other hand, if you try to play first-person, Garrett now has the silliest ""peeking"" style. He no longer leans left or right. He now STEPS out to ""peek"" around corners. And, yes, this is visible to enemies and changes your exposure on the light crystal. It's completely useless in first-person and completely superfluous in third-person. It really only does one thing: allows you to eavesdrop through doors. The floating head physics we had in the originals is also out. He has a solid body now, but unless you use that third person camera, you'll find Garrett's body and legs bumping into chairs and tables, making all kinds of noise. What else... oh, he's forgotten how to swim. Water is now an insta-kill border in the game. He has a turning radius like a van now. This is most frustrating when traversing ledges and pipes. If you turn your head and walk on a pipe you might fall off as he takes a wide semi-circular path to straighten out. Also, weird bug, occasionally when you jump in the air or try to mantle something he'll get ""stuck"" and hover around in a frozen falling/climbing animation. I'll admit this is useful sometimes because he makes no footstep noises while he flies around a few inches above the ground.The graphics have been ""improved"" but at terrible cost. Whereas, Thief 1 and 2 had absolutely sprawling levels that you could run from end to end on a whim, Thief 3, as I'll be calling this, has mid-level loading zones! And they are every bit as obnoxious as you could imagine. And like the rest of that stuff I've mentioned, this has unfortunate consequences. When you zone, time freezes in the previous section. If you try ducking into another section with the City Watch in hot pursuit, when you return they'll be exactly where you left them, in mid-sentence even.The story, that all-important story, is pretty good. Yes, it's not all bad here. I think it ties everything up fairly well; however, the execution was not excellent. The final scene, meant to invoke a ""coming full circle"" effect, came off as contrived. I also really miss the distinctive art style of the mission briefings and cutscenes. The briefings are just voiced-over text paragraphs now, and most of the cutscenes went for a realistic CGI direction and they.... do not look so good. The best ones invariably slid back towards the ""moving comic"" style of the originals.The quality of the in-game dialogue and texts has taken a steep, steep dive. Of particular note, the speech of the Pagans almost seems like it was written by someone who listened to some of the original Pagans and just tried to mimic that, not someone who was originally involved in the process. It just sounds... silly. Garrett lampshades this by blatantly stating they speak in a funny dialect that focuses on the letter 's'. This doesn't excuse things.Conclusion: I do recommend this game, but only just. Play it to see the story through to the end. Despite all my criticism, this game isn't terrible but it doesn't hold a candle to The Dark Project or The Metal Age.P.S. Credit where credit is due: The best part of the game is without a doubt the Shalebridge Cradle mission. It's creepy, it's atmospheric, it calls back to Gervasius' library (Thief 2). That single level shines like a gem amid the rest of this game's muck.			",368,121,4,38,24,4,56

												I fondly remember this game which was the first stealth based one I played. There are especially two scenes I remember for their uniqueness when compared to other gaming experiences I had up to that time.The first one was in Shalebridge Cradle. I entered this old decaying building in the middle of the night. On my path to the uppermost level of the cradle I was crawling up that long and wide circular stairs, when the athmosphere and the sound of the scenery won: I could't bear the tension and closed the game. The next day, in bright sunlight, I tried it again - and failed after seconds. Too vivid were the horrors I imagined lurking in the halls beyond.So I got reinforcements and brought a friend who - unlike me - had played and loved the first two titles of the series. That actually helped and - slowly - I made my way up the stairs. I can't remember the exact place, but soon  afterwards I looked at the crossing of two hallways. So many directions the evil that must be lurking in this building could come from! Cautiously I approached the crossing, listening for treacherous sounds, when I suddenly saw something moving in the dark. My heart rate increased when I went to investigate it. But I couldn't find anything in any direction. Then - you know what's coming! - I turned around, only to find myself eye to eye wuth the first of the gruesome remnants of this cursed place. I screamed like a little girl and ran! Then my friend and me had a good laugh.In the other scene I remember I was lurking atop some walkway which was built at noticable height to allow good overwatch. I believe this was when I made contact with the pagans, but don't know for sure. However, I saw some female guard on patrol right below me with no one else in sight. I braced myself and jumped down, expecting to hurt myself. Instead I landed gracefully right behind the guard who, to my excitement, screamed in surprise without turning around - paralysed be the shock. Once I understood what had just happend I took advantage of it and landed a clean hit with my trusty blackjack before the scream ended to knock out the poor guard. Amazing!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I know this is an old game(s) and most of my steam friends probably played and finished years ago. But I want to say somethings about it.  + Good story. + Good and rich lore. + Detailed and different missions. + Interesting characters. + Good game mechanichs. + Hiding, sneaking and stealing.  This game has it all and gives you something different than the other games out there. You don't need to kill anybody. You are a thief and you are stealing stuff. Nothing more. Hiding in the shadows, waiting a guard to pass so you can steal the object you need or you can make him go away with the weapons in your arsenal so you don't have to wait. Reading scrolls, letters or important books so that you can learn about the world and the characters. It's fun. As I said, this isn't a any other game that gives you the best weapons and wants you to be kill everybody on the map. While in cut scenes main characters talks about ""not killing"" anybody but in game is a bloodbath.  If you are up to challange and if you really want to enjoy the game you sould play it on expert difficulty. It's force you to think and act differently, because you can't kill anybody on that difficulty.			",68,29,0,11,1,0,4

												This game is currently the only Thief game I've played, but I've heard people say that this game isn't any good compared to the others... may or may not be true but I had a very, very good time playing this game. The buggy mess that T:DS may be (I lost saves two times, but I still wanted to replay from the beginning) is actually one of the best games I've ever played! Excellent stealth gameplay combined with artsy good looking graphics (yes, outdated but who cares?) and a very enjoyable story makes this game absoloutely worth it considering the cheap price! 9/10			",54,3,1,6,5,1,9

												For a better experience install the Sneaky Uprade (to make it look better and run more smoothly). Most bad reviews are from people having bugs and issues. The Sneaky Upgrade should solve them all.Now to the game - to put it short it's the best stealth game I've played. Also one of the best fantasy games I've played. Intriguing story, a slight cyberpunk feel and the overall arcanum atmosphere. Several missions are also taffing spooky and one went in the history of horror games eve though it's not a horror game. 10/10 (For a game of its age)			",115,37,5,4,9,1,15

Playing as Garrett is vicarious pleasure at its finest**Edit update 23.11.16: Nominated for the 2016 Steam Awards ""Test of Time"" award... Why do I think it should win? Read on!**Deadly Shadows (the Thief series, really) is still the best atmospheric stealth game ever devised. The Cradle, twelve years later, is still one of the most memorable and stress-inducing levels ever engineered in gaming history.And the story? Oh, the story! The politics, corruption, faiths and intrigue of the sublimely steampunk-esque City, its denizens, and gritty Garrett that are the fibers weaving the story whole, ranks among the best ever conceived in interactive fiction. And the best part of this? It's not at all heavy-handedly delivered. Through Garrett's interactions with others, his missions, wry and cynical comments, astute observations and indifferent facade, you become incredibly intimate with the goings-on in this universe as though you've always been a part of it.I played Deadly Shadows in its entirety countless times over the years; every time, I laid not one finger upon another game till I saw Garrett come out unscathed--it's that engaging. I've never encountered anything game-breaking during play, with the original hard copy, GOG or Steam versions. Any reload done was because I'm a purist--it can happen that I miss a few bob, or inadvertently break the neck of some knocked-unconscious person when I toss them on the ground in deeper shadows. As for graphics and game play, Deadly Shadows (released in 2004!) surpasses many lauded and triple A titles of today. With exemplary voice acting and ambient sounds that will devour you... you'll love every moment of it.Pairing Stephen Russell's voice with Garrett's character was a match made in Gamers' Heaven. Two years later and I still find myself bemoaning why--oh why?!--didn't the devs make the thief in the 2014 title be an apprenticed successor to Russell's Garrett when it became apparent Russell was not up to their technological tasks, and that Garrett's fate in this title is so highly satisfying. (This is the only reason why I haven't played that game--and may likely never will.) It used to be very puzzling to me that we saw some fanboy division with each release of a sequel since Gold, because I immensely enjoy all--Thief Gold, Metal Age and this title--but as I've entered that divided fanboy category by not buying Thief (2014), I guess I can sympathise now.If you've never crossed paths with a Keeper Enforcer, never slinked around a Hammerite Temple leaving puddles in your wake, or simply have no clue just how ******* hilarious the word ""taff"" is--along with all its derivational affixes--do yourself a massive favour and play Deadly Shadows and all will bees woodsy. Highly recommended:For complete character and story immersion, first play Thief Gold, then Thief II: The Metal Age, and then this, Thief: Deadly ShadowsWear a pair of high-quality headphones *Play during the evening or laterPlay with absolutely NO distractions* headphones are a requirement, really11/10What are you taffin' waiting for? Buy it already, you Taffer! ",257,121,0,66,43,2,56

												Put on your thief cap and play as Garret the master thief as you slowly...very slowly traverse through a stygian world and come to realise that this game is more than it surfaces to be. Regardless of how you look at it, it's a slow paced game. To combat this the devs needed to inject it with diversity. At times the lack of fleshed out design imposes restrictions on player choice. Some levels are too linear though some have multiple ways around and multiple ways to tackle chokepoints. At your disposal you have a blackjack for knocking out enemies and diverse range of arrows (fire, water, noise, broadhead, moss etc) and other paraphernalia from holy water to mines. (Additional melee combat exists but it's fittingly pointless). I can't say how the game changes on the hardest difficulty. Maybe it requires you to get all the loot or maybe it makes loot more scarce so more importance is placed on player choice and sacrifice regarding item purchases. I'd prefer the latter.The game lets you leave trails of cadavers but ideally you would just sneak past everyone for obvious reasons. The types of cadavers... well the devs weren't exactly liberal with enemy variety. Most react the same when you hint at your presence but later in the game they get a bit more anomalous and ergo stealth becomes more tense. Stealth is implemented well. It doesn't solely focus on realism as that would detract from the fun factor.The cutscenes are flawlessly done which help spur you on through the intriguing story. The old fashioned art style in these cutscenes along with the inflated, overlapping and echoing sound also really help accentuate the fact that this game will indeed be an unsettling experience.   Though you can't talk unsettling without mentioning the Shalebridge Cradle. Not even nepenthes could calm the soul from what this level has to offer. Hope leaves and grief sets in and grows as you progress through the level. Dark paranoia consumes you via a richly constructed soundscape and haunting scenery. To this day the only game that I've found that competes at inundating you with complete foreboding ambience is the Ocean House Hotel (V:TM-B). Morbid curiosity poked me through to the end of both these levels and left me exhausted, relieved but also fascinated on how both areas exceed 99% of dedicated horror games. Maybe that percentage can be lowered with the highly anticipated collaboration between Kojima and Guillermoh♥♥♥♥youkonami...			",129,17,0,22,9,0,3

												The Shalebridge Cradle. It used to be an insane asylum, and before that it was an orphanage. One night a fire started, no one knows how, and after that they left the place abandoned.

If you have no idea what I mean by that, then all I have to say is to check out the first two games, and then consider this game again. Much of the storyline has attained closure at the end of Thief 3, storyline that has been developed through two previous games as well as this one. A fantastic storyline, at that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine  MY BRAVERY COMES TO A CONCLUSION TO THE FINAL GAME IN A MASTERPIECE TRILOGY THAT ORIGINALLY MADE ME NOT WANT TO CONTINUE THE SERIES One of the greatest and classical masterpieces of all time yet again returns with Thief III: Deadly Shadows, not developed by the now defunct company Looking Glass Studios, however by another company Ion Storm Interactive, it puts you in the Steampunk Victorian times, with creepy music, great atmosphere (believe me this game scares me to bits!), great story line and great voice acting! The only problems I encountered with the game is that its too confusing to get to somewhere, and also the first time I got it, it was poorly optimized, so I highly recommend if you are using an up-to-date PC, to download an unofficial patch which fixes some of the problems like cut scenes not working, bad resolutions and poor quality. But set aside all these problems, and you have a perfect stealth masterpiece.Stick to the shadows at all costs! RECOMMENDED :)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game has to be one of the most atmospheric games I have played and I am going to explain why.The Level Design was absolutely memorable for me, especially for one particular, unique level in the story, but I will let you find that out yourself. You were also given a variety of options on how to approach an area in each level, with an arsenal and tools to add to your heists. The game also offers an open-world aspect early in the start of the game, offering places to loot, hidden locations, a variety of dangers on the road in the game, eavesdrop on dialogue, which may lead to places to rob and important information and or hidden locations, and more.The soundtrack for this game was absolutely amazing in every aspect for me, I was spooked by every note in every step I took, walking ever so softly, sneaking past dangers the game offers.Creature Design: You will literally say 'What the fu*k' when you discover each creature in this game. This is all I am going to say, I will let you discover that for yourself. There is a huge variety of enemies in this game.The storyline was very fun, going through what Garrett's story is in the third of the series.All in all, I would recommend this game to anyone who loves the Medieval category, stealth, and or likes an atmospheric and eerie category. This is all I will explain in this review as you have to experience it for yourself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thief: Deadly Shadows is the third Thief game in the original trilogy. Since original developers of the first two Thief games,  Looking Glass Studios, ended up closing due to financial troubles, Ion Storm was the one to develop the final game in trilogy, releasing it in 2004. Thankfully, this company hired some developers that were working in Looking Glass and based game development on their original vision of the third game so you can still be sure that true Thief game plot-wise and great conclusion. Oh, and it's based on Deus Ex IW engine which is heavily modified Unreal 2 and is known as being bad.It's also was developed for both Xbox and PC and yet, console restriction hit PC version as well. Enjoy tiny levels with loading gates. And intro automatically running if you stay in main menu for some time.Xbox version and PC are very close to each other. Xbox version makes some interesting use of gamepad, where you can easily set a needed speed with analog stick and it also gives ramble feedback during lockpick minigame. But then agian, Xbox never recieved any patches, so stick with PC.Technically, it's one of the buggiest games around. Or more exactly, it hangs on this territory where bugs aren't strong enough to completely stop you from playing yet you will be kept reminded that they exist and will meet them around at every corner. It would make Bethesda explode from envy. Then again, what else would one expect from makers of Daikatana. Hell, this game even had a bug at the launch that would always reset difficulty to normal. At least it got fixed. Yes, Steam version has latest version.Like, everytime the game was loading something, it would show my desktop twice in the beggining, which was annoying me. Then the framerate often goes awry when there are multiple light sources present on the screen. Maybe because it doesn't support more than one processor or just because of bad compitability. And sometimes it just crashes on quicksave. At least in these cases it wouldn't get corrupted, thank goodness for that.And then I heard that some people had issues where lockpicking minigame does not display on screen. In such cases some suggested turning off V-Sync. But some still had troubles.Eh, you really should download some of community patches. Really. Though I played without any, because all yay vanilla experience.The game continues the story of Garrett the Master Thief in the City. Twice did he impact and restore the balance of powers as evidenced in previous games. The last time he stopped the Mechanists with all their mechanical progressive view. As a result the City seemed to abandon everything that they have done. Actually, it went into such extreme of Medivel style category, that there is almost no Steampunk left. As a result Thief 3 seem to have the most bland, uninspired envirmoment and seems to lack same charm of mystery and Fantasy/Steampunk that I came to like about original. It's all about cartoonish blue darkness now. Which isn't to say that it doesn't have a few immersive memoriable levels. And music does fine job sometimes too. But yea, it's not same anymore.But hey, those few levels are indeed very moody and nice experiences. Even if most of them are gray and bland.Like Museum level with low-humming music and creepy recordings. Or the mansion level while there is storm and rain outside. Or even the famous Cradle horror-level which, while isn't going to scare anybody nowadays and also quite bland overall, still provides an interesting level-plot and exploration of it.And in this game you will get yourself close with Keepers and their prophesies, with game providing good conclusion to the series. I am not going to spoil much, but it's quite interesting to follow. Just a shame that cutscenes aren't even. Half of cutscenes are nicely drawn animations. And another half is made using ugly, by comparison, in-game models. Oh well.  And no, animations aren't in same style as the first two games. No briefing either, aw.And to be honest, first impression with the game was just godawful. It combines the third and first person view into one ugly movement that seem to be bad in both modes and there are tons of glitches. It seems like the first person is done just by moving camera to where the head. Ok, that doesn't sound too wrong and it's nice to see your hands and legs. But, don't know how to explain, but the way it controls in first person feels clumpsy, like the game has to synchronise your movement with one of model animations. Heck, the head camera seems to lag and rubberband around the body itself. Even leaning may make you fall off the edge sicne it's uses slow clunky animation that shifts your collision box along. Heck, it even takes a second for body to turn around when you start moving in different direction.The third person perspective isn't much either. It's not as immersive experience. And then I am not sure how I am supposed to turn around while standing in same spot, with PC default controls. Which also reminds me that game was so rushed that they didn't include mouse sensetivity in options.So yea, it's more about you trying to get used to first person control, while switching to third person around corner to peek around without revealing yourself, which you can view as nessercary ""cheating"". And then the clumpsy movement add up to overall bugginess. Like not being able to pick up some ragdolls. Or some items in chest. Or being able to pick one through the locked chest. Or seemingly not being able to stand up near walls. Or getting stuck after jumping attempts in some strange hovering state where you can't jump anymore until you pull arrow with your bow. Or hell, getting stuck between two barrels where I had to knife one of them for whole two minutes until I finally knocked it out where it rolled down the slope, fell and made woman on another side of wall gasp. Is this emergent gameplay that everybody makes buzz about?Gameplay-wise it also got changed around. Like, Garrett changed sword to daggers. Which may sound fancy, but it means no more cool sword fights. Now combat sucks, as you can't block, just you trading damages with enemy. I know that it's not something player is supposed to do, but it was cool to do some sword-fight when backed into corner. Then agian, escaping is more viable there as NPCs get tired from chasing after Garrett after some time and have to stand and take a rest. And hiding in shadows is as easy as ever. By the way, this game was one of the first to use dynamic shadows, like in Doom 3. And it makes use of them heavily, graphic-wise. Gameplay-wise? Nah, nothing to do with moving shadows, nothing programmed to recognise that. Oh well. At least you can blow small candles up now.It also turned lockpick into minigame. Nothing exciting, it looked interesting at first, but soon you will realize how limited it is and how tedious it gets as it gets longer and longer futher in game.It also includes city hub thing. Which could be better. It's a nice time waster of sorts, you can pickpocket, unlock some doors and steal objects so you could sell them and buy yourself supplies of items. But it gets old to avoid same guards around most corner. It has pathetic faction system where you have to do some small things so they will not attack you. It's easy to do and there is no conflict between trying your best to amuse both factions, no interesting things happen otherwise. It does get funny when, in order to appeal to Hammerites, you shoot arrows at explosive rust bugs only for everybody in the city to freak out and call out you as murderer. Meh, it's mostly fun only to see chaos later on in the game, as silly as it looks.It's not something I would highly recommend to new players, but those who want to see conclusion of the Thief storyline will be happy enough. Too many loading gates and glitches though.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												Two words: Shalebridge Cradle.And in considerably more words, Thief: Deadly Shadows is an excellent game. I didn’t start off by playing it, unfortunately. I played the Thief reboot in 2015 as my introduction to this series; sure, it was pretty to look at (when the poor PC optimization didn’t cause it to crash) but I thought it was needlessly frustrating, mediocre, and actually quite boring. Given the fascinating steampunk setting, I was expecting a more interesting story. I didn’t even bother finishing the game because I was not left feeling engaged with the characters or the world. After some more research, I found out many other people-new comers and hardened taffers alike-had similar issues with the reboot, yet offered nothing but praise for previous entries, especially Deadly Shadows. I decided to give it a try, and after installing the essential, wonderful Sneaky Upgrade I discovered the magic of Thief. This is one of the best examples of a stealth game that rewards creativity, exploration, and curiosity. From the use of sound (such as different surfaces echoing Garret’s footsteps, NPC banter, and of course the great music), resource management, and the interplay between light and dark; to the charming, intriguing characters, meticulously thought out settings, and a lore steeped with mystery, I just couldn’t get enough playing this game. Deadly Shadows respects you: as a player, as a Thief, as a person with intelligence and a desire to have fun. I appreciate the obvious effort put into creating an excellent experience. Also, I have to mention that I really liked the unique animation style of the cut scenes. Although the game does show its age at times, it manages to be endearing. Thief: Deadly Shadows was way ahead of its time, and remains immensely enjoyable. As they say, it’s quite a steal.			",17,5,0,2,0,0,0

												How do I put this without sounding like a fanboy... Nah, screw it. THIS GAME IS GREAT. It's probably the best stealth game on the market, the newer one pales in comparison but unfortunately the game is not able to run on my pc due to it being so old and outdated, overall you have to jump through a lot of hoops to get it working but it's so worth, fortunately the steam forums are really helpful when it comes to fixing the game.The immersion level of this game is astounding, as a kid there was one particular level that gave me nightmares after playing it. You play as Garett, a thief in a city reminiscent of medieval times and you do what a thief does, steal stuff, hide from guards and... other things. This is and will always be one of my favorite games ever.			",301,66,4,25,21,2,45

												Not as bad as some gamers claim it! Thief:DS is definitely the weakest addition to the Thief series. I think the reason behind that are the innovations the developers tried to implement in the game. Innovations like the new open city, the player can explore between missions( In the previous games the player were placed from mission to mission) , the cutscenes now use simply animation (previously they used partly animation, and partly motion capture technology). The developers tried to update the game to 2004 gaming standards, and I think it was not liked by many old fans of the series. I have to admit that the story is somewhat weaker this time (The villain in the game is not as charismatic as Karras or the Trickster.) Above all I still enjoyed the game. It had the same stealth mechanism as the previous games. The atmosphere of the old games was still present, the graphics were improved, it had great music, and really good missions ( Like the Cradle). The story of Garrett came to a full circle in this last installment.			",109,9,3,4,1,1,1

												Finally a Thief game that actually works! Very few times did I scream with anger at the computer because something broke, or my character got stuck in something illogical or anything that got me pretty ♥♥♥♥ing mad at the first two games. However, this one does seem to have lesser variety in scenery. The cradle level was specially fun :)The hub system gets a bit annoying with all the respawning guards and having to knock them out every single time, but it can be dealt with, and if you're tired of sneaking past them you can easily outrun them if you know where you're going.The map is INCREDIBLY annoying , it does not show where you are,  and this becomes a major bother when you save somewhere in a level and get back to it some other day.This game is strange in that Garett sometimes moves like he has net lag, it feels like he stops a bit or gets thrown back a bit sometimes, like he is suffering from rubberbanding, somewhat strange.The wall climbing feature could be improved a bit, sometimes it does not work properly, but you can finish the game properly.

												Ahhh, the awkward third album...A lot of people have claimed this to be the worst of the three, but that being said...I can't see what they're talking about.It's a FANTASTIC game, however if you don't like stealth (which really is essential in this one) then look elsewhere...then again, if you don't like stealth why are you looking at this game in the first place?I admit the story isn't brilliant, but that being the case please explain what was so overwhelmingly brilliant about the story in I&II? In all seriousness, I prefer this game to the other two (and the new one, which was not as bad as everyone claims).One of my favourite games of all time, you have to think and carefully plan out your tactics in order to be succesful. My kind of game, challenging but not insanely teeth grittingly difficult.My only issue was getting it to run properly, I found the game crashed every time I tried to save in certain areas. I did manage to fix this by downloading a patch (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfU-mx8cc-Y) and running as administrator.8/10, maybe it's just me, but even with it's flaws and need for patching it's one of the best games I ever played.

												The Thief series is the bestest of all the stealth games.  Deadly Shadows is the worst of the three games, but it's like saying chocolate cake is worse than slightly more chocolate cake.  i.e. It's still great.  The main advantage Thief 1&2 have is that the levels are massive and nonlinear, in Deadly Shadows the levels became much smaller and straightforward due to consolisation.  Unless you hate late 90s graphics play Thief 2 first at the very least, but Deadly Shadows is still very good.			",192,73,1,23,11,2,39

												I originally had the mentality of playing through all three games in order. I succeeded in that by beating Thief 1 & 2 last year but when it came time to play this game I just couldn't adapt to all the gameplay changes this game has compared to the original two. I made it far though regardless of my hangups, I do like the plot and the atmosphere as always, but there is just something off about this game ever so slightly. It doesn't feel as smooth and polished as the first two games so eventually I just stopped playing it altogether. In hindsight I think it was a mistake for me to try and play this so soon after beating Thief 2. I literally booted it up almost after I beat Thief 2. So all my gameplay habits and strategies from the first two were still fresh in my mind. So if I ever do try this game again I will make it my mission to not play Thief 1 or 2 beforehand. I will still probably end up preferring Thief 1 & 2 but I think it will allow me to enjoy this game more and possibly fully get into it. Things I liked: I liked the idea of the City being a hub and Garrett having to go to fences to sell off his valuables to various Black Market Fences. I liked having the freedom to pretty much go almost anywhere and just mess with people. I liked that Guards are way more aware of the enviroment and what you do in the enviroment. I absolutely loved the amazing dynamic lighting that this game has. Then to top it off Eric Brosius's sound design on this is still just as good as his work on the originals. Things I didn't like as much: Body awareness as a whole is a huge fault in the sense that it makes things like mantling and platforming more of a chore than a fun mechanic. I loved sprinting around and mantling onto things in the first two games it's what made me feel like a master thief. It made sense that Garrett could be that agile and be so good at grabbing onto ledges. Whereas in this game it feels like Garrett is wearing suction cups for boots and has two broken legs. Then I also really couldn't stand how the structure of the game played out. The story is fine and is really good but the flow between and inbetween missions just feels wrong. Like I said, I do like the idea of the City being a hub it's a good idea I just don't think they pulled it off. Overall thoughts: I think there is definitely a good game here and I honestly wish steam allowed a middle ground option for recommendations. I can't say I outright recommend this or don't it was a very polarizing game for me but I did enjoy a lot about it because it continued the plot and story from Thief 1 & 2 so in that sense I do recommed it. I just have to say do not play them in order...or...if you do just don't go in thinking the game is going to play exactly like you expect it will. This game is still Thief do not get me wrong but it is a very different skeleton than the one Thief 1 & 2 had.			",255,23,1,33,3,0,5

												Bought Thief 2014 first. I have to say TDS knocks Thief 2014 into a cocked hat. No annoying context-based jump/climb hassles and no silly eye icon over an NPC's head if you are detected, or when the NPC is suspicious. Paradoxically, 2014 has slicker graphics but the eye icon looks like a clumsy overlay.After only a few hours into TDS, I'm hooked. The graphics are much better than I anticipated they would be. The player feels like they are moving around in a proper world space in TDS. The world space feels warmer, more realistic and thus more believable. Thief 2014's graphics seem like washed out, pen and ink in comparison; they are unable to create a sense of place that feels real: nicely Gothic on the one hand, yet somehow ""flat"" on the other. I wonder if the developers of Thief 2014 deliberately tried to create a washed out, dark world. If they did, they partly succeeded but they lost something in the process. I realise this review is about TDS, but comparison with related games is sometimes appropriate. Thief 2014 is ok but TDS...way better.The stealth mechanics in TDS are very good and make sense (the ""swoop"" movement in Thief 2014 was off putting/counter intuitive for me). Navigation is difficult because of the absence of a marker icon to follow. Navigating ones way around without an onboard compass is both realistic and assists with immersion/believability. After all, the player is supposed to be finding their way around an unfamiliar environment, rather than being led onwards by the gaming equivalent of satnav. Unlike Thief 2014 there aren't, so far, guards at every damned turn. Even though Thief 2014 had better (for which read ""hand holding"") navigation, the presence of guards EVERYWHERE made getting around a real pain in the neck.Having to visit fences to offload loot is also immersive. I didn't like simply finding myself x amount of gold richer after completing a mission in Thief 2014.After only a handful of hours gameplay, it might seem premature to post a review. However, I've played enough games to recognise quality when I see it. How I overlooked this wee gem I simply do not know. TDS is my winter project and I'm looking forward to it. I've only paused gameplay because I have other things to do.			",3,0,0,4,0,0,0

												A few years into the 00s I moved highschools, and nations, returning to my homeland (awful culture shock) and going to a new venue of education full of crappy students who were crappy humans to boot. One class, however, featured another foreign raised student, and while he didn't turn out to be a lifelong friend, I will never forget the way he broke the ice with me, or the French accent with which he did it:""Have you played Thief: Deadly Shadouws?""He turned the 'doughs' ending of shadows into something that rhymes with 'dues', you see.I told him I hadn't, and not long after that he had given me a copy of the title, and so I was introduced to bump-mapping. Deadly Shadows, along with Doom 3, were the first games I got for my family's first ever powerful PC, and to me, Deadly Shadows was the future. A game with intense sound design, graphics supercharged by bump mapping, stylish cinematics... it was a fascinating bridge between the games represented by Thief 2 or even Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast and the games of the future, like Oblivion or Mass Effect.Of course, it was held back. We didn't really know it at the time but the flashy graphics hid miniscule world maps, made necessary by the hardware limitations of the xBox, the menus and maps were dated and in some cases clunky to navigate, the UI was simplistic and the voice acting was actually kinda crap - indeed, befitting of the status of the game as a bridge between two epochs of gaming, the voice acting would best be described as of late-90s standard.But none of that stopped me from idolising this game. Never quite finishing it because stuff just got too real around about the time you started fighting cult members wearing goat heads and, as a youngish gamer I was awestruck by the graphics of Doom3 and repeatedly went back there when things didn't go my way with Garrett, I nevertheless developed a deep love for the title and an abiding desire to know just what happened in the end. One day, this steam version will aid me.The plot? Well, in broad strokes, Garret the Thief belongs to a secret society of monk'ish people who deal in magic and such, but something is astir in the City which big G calls his home and it is actually all pretty sinister feeling. You start off stealing things, and plotlines interweave quite well, and difficulty scales reasonably well as you progress. Characters are forgettable aside from big G, enemies are reasonably various and can be quite challenging.All in all this is a pretty good title, with some nifty technology, if one looks past the components which are outdated and forgives the size of maps and resultant frequency of loading pages. Definitely worth buying and completing over a rainy weekend or two.8/10			",75,6,0,24,6,0,27

												The 3rd game in the series. Deadly Shadows continues the tradition while changing some things. With modern technology at the time it captures the feel and atmosphere of the original 2 with even more detail. It's true the levels are smaller but they still have great design, they're good levels. There's a mod that comes with the sneaky upgrade, that does a wonderful job getting rid of the mid loading screens in the level and reattaches them seamlessly. The game still has the same drawn art style for most cutscenes and Garret's wonderful voice actor returns with great comments on everything. One thing this game experiemnted with and did a great job on it, is a day to day system with a hub world or hub city. Between missions you will traverse a city with many different districts that contain all kinds of nooks and crannies for you to check out and do a little....thiefing. The game continues the tradition of true stealth gameplay and implemented great sound design to make it work right. It's true that there was a odd design choice to get rid of the rope and vine arrows and exchange them for climbing gloves. The climbing gloves arent bad, they're actually pretty cool, would of been nice to have them and the rope arrows. They did also experiment with a Faction System, they didn't do much with it. You got the Hammerites and the Pagans you can complete tasks to make them neutral or allies in the hub city. I think its best to leave it as hostile, seeing as Garret has done enough to both of them that they would want to kill him no matter what and makes the game a little more challenging. So not wanting to spoil anything, i highly recommend this game. It's a true stealth game, a true Thief game, has the story, voice acting, great sound and level design and the stealthy gameplay. The only final thing is that if you want some slightly better textures for a already beautiful game and re-connected levels then i recommend the Sneaky Upgrade mod here http://www.moddb.com/mods/thief-3-sneaky-upgrade/downloads/sneaky-upgrade-fat-editionEnjoy you Taffers!

												This game is from the best franchise ever made. However, this particular title isn't quite as good as the first two in the series. While still a good game, it was co-developed for consoles and suffered for it, both in terms of UI and a lot more load screens. There are mods to help improve the experience, though, and it can still be a lot of fun. I definitely recommend playing Thief 1 and 2 first.			",556,177,12,92,48,6,81

												If you like stealth games, and medieval time settings, then you'll love this game. Amazing story, great gameplay, and friendly control schemes that are fully editable. I first played this game years ago when it first came out on XBOX, and just recently got it again for PC, and it has not lost any of it's charm in that time. It says it doesn't support play on laptops, but it works flawlessly on my Win 7 laptop. Just make sure you download the Sneaky Upgrade for it. I fully recommend this game to any fans of the genre. Trust me, at the base price it has ($8.99) it is a must buy, and you won't regret a penny of that purchase.			",227,76,4,43,31,5,67

												This game...All the reviews were right. I have just started this game, but wow i love the depth, plot detail, and faction elements they have put in this story. The music is awesome. It sets the tone.This should be a standard for gaming.It's a sad shame that so many games coming out are garbage (even so called AAA), cash grabs using hype and graphics to win over mutton head casual gamers (read: CONSOLE coming to PC). I heard a little about the demise of this game dev company and it's sad. We gamers should be rewarding good game developers by passing the word, likewise pass the word on the garbage to stear clear of buying. Final note: have you noticed how many ""alpha"", ""beta"", and ""pre-release"" games are being sold on Steam, and then they fail to finish or deliver?P.S. Thief 3 Deadly Shadows is better than Thief 4 for it's immersion and story arc depth. Graphics aren't everything!Edit: now that i have begun to play the game a bit i have found some annoyances like a ""jump"" bug. Garrett gets stuck in the jump animation and kinda of floats around. Also, you can get stuck behind objects.I also wish the city was more in depth. The pathways are pretty linear, and Thief 4 actually has a more interesting city, imo, but Thief 4 has HORRIBLE loops of AI voice samples (the Polly Adler loop, for example). The guards are actually better in Thief 3. They have more interesting pathing runs and voice samples (ie: the Hammerites constant reiteration of their orthodoxy: it's creative). The loading screens are immersion breaking.The mob AI can be pretty stupid ( like every other game). I wish there was more rooftop traveling. At one point Garret  calls rooves ""Thieves highways"". I hope more ""highways' come later, because right now, its just a truck stop.Garrets apartment is also needing something to it. Thief 4 actually has this better as well (with your trophy boxes).Another annoyamce: you can't alt-tab while running Thief 3. If you alt-tab, your computer basically locks up and you can't close the game. Steam overlay doesn't work with it either.BUT so far i really like this game, and highly recommend it!

												NOTE** Review below by Archsteel...ignore it. The dude doesn't know how to play the game, and judges the entire thing based on the tutorial level. If you want to know what this game is like, you have to play past the tutorial. For example, he wanted to stab a guard to death, and attempted to just quickly walk up and stab him in the back like this is an Elder Scrolls game. You have to wait until you are signaled that the one shot is in range -- Garrett raises his dagger up above his head, then you can make the one-shot kill. It works the same as the blackjack.Best Thief game of the first three.Town to explore = extra loot.Wall-climbing gloves.No sword fights, just blackjack, dagger, and bow.Third-person view.More planning necessary than in the first two games.Fences and stores throughout town.Ability to make guards kill the thugs by tricking them into thinking thugs murdered someone.Ability to make thugs kill civilians by tricking them into thinking civilians murdered someone.Causing a giant riot-like murder spree of thugs killing civilians, and guards and thugs killing each other.11/10			",95,5,1,18,6,0,18

												Beautiful game! I have played this game 3 times already (not on the stem version) and I´m going in for a fourth time. I love the mechanics, the flair, the jokes, just everything about this. It´s not super realistic or anything for nowadays standards but thats a big part of the experience here. It adds a lot of charm and possibilities to the game. An I get dragged in so much when a guard discovers me that I get more of an adrenalin rush than in horror games. I really enjoy it and hope you do too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a pretty amazing game, for the most part. 20 years ago I had a demo for Thief 1 which was the tutorial and the first mission where you rob some rich dude. I played it to death over and over and loved it. Finally got the full game and was devastatingly disappointed when you move on to stalking graveyards, spelunking in caves, fighting/avoiding ghosts, fighting/avoiding zombies, etc... I just wanted to rob rich dudes! Is that too much to ask?! Gave Thief 2 a try when it came out and now we're fighting/avoiding robots in factories or something. Then I dropped the series in disappointment.Too bad I missed out on Thief 3: Deadly Shadows when it released because this game is everything I wanted from the original Thief 20 years ago! The lore in the series is pretty rich so the ghosts, zombies, caves, etc all make a return but they're very minor parts that weave into the story very well. For the most part you're robbing rich dudes, subverting cults, saving the world, etc all while lining your pockets along the way. This is an old game in a well-known series so I won't write one of my normal detailed reviews. All I want to say is that this game basically repaired a small part of my childhood and for that it's awesome. It's not completely without flaws. Controversially, this game dropped from a 10/10 to a 9/10 because of the Shalebridge Cradle level. Most people love this level and I know why. When I first started it was extremely atmospheric and tense. This quickly became one of the most tedious and frustrating levels in the game, though. Instant failure states and near invulnerable enemies (unless you want to spend a lot of expensive resources putting them down permanently) mean you'll be save scumming a lot here. That's just one level, though. Overall, an epic game. A must-play for any Thief fan and a must-play for any would-be Thief fan that was put off by the earlier games in the series, like I was. 9/10			",146,48,0,16,15,0,14

												Deadly Shadows initially got a lot of stick for ""consolization"" and technical issues.  These days, on a fast system and with some tweaks, many of those issues are moot.  And some of the differences between DS and Thief 2 are easier to accept now as design changes rather than blasphemy.Its environments are fun to explore and often atmospheric, but it doesn't have as many wide-open or weird levels as previous Thief games.  The lack of rope arrows is also unfortunate.  But it's a strong Thief experience that you're not likely to get elsewhere, and its story nicely concludes the trilogy.  It also adds to the Thief recipe with a bit of sandboxy-ness in the City that joins missions together.My major gripe is that blackjacking can solve almost all situations, at least on Normal. I didn't play Expert because the high loot requirement can get tedious, but maybe on Expert you'd have more need to use other tools. A few basic setup tips:

												Played to completion as a no-kill run (with use of blackjack/other tools). PC version 1.1Good things that are goodThe overall banter from everyone as you do your thing is very funny. Many guards have different personalities (normal, drunk, sick, tired) and talk to each other very realistically. Guards next to each other will actively inform one another about the situation at hand. It's also funny that everyone thinks unconscious people are dead.There's a good amount of gameplay, and the levels are interesting for the most part. The hub world is surprisingly well thought out, and the changes it undergoes as the game progresses are impressive.The horror mission is actually pretty scary, people weren't kidding.The story is interesting enough to keep you wanting to move forward. It's not fantastic, it's just interesting.The tools you are given to mess around with are great and have significant impact on the enemies and environment.Money is good and there is a lot of money everywhere. Probably won't be able to spend it all, though.The AI is fun to elude and doesn't cheat you for the most part.It's not a bad game. I can't recommend it, though, because of the glaring issues throughout that ruin the experience.Bugs / AnnoyancesLOADINGLoading your game takes forever. Moving from map to map takes forever. Quicksaving is quick, but quickloading is slow as hell.Loading happens a lot in this game. It gets very grating very quickly. MOVEMENTMany times when you jump, your jump is cancelled and you are stuck in a sort of hovering mode. In this you can't jump and can't climb. To get out of it, you must draw an arrow and then put the arrow back. This glitch is by far the most annoying one, and will ruin dramatic moments or great escapes.You can climb onto ledges, but a lot of times it does not register, and if you are falling at any speed it will refuse to latch on. This means that if you make a jump but start slipping off the edge, you cannot grab onto the edge - you're doomed to fall.Small items on the ground, including corpses, will impede your movement and jitter the camera. Sometimes the physics has a bug and causes an extremely loud collision noise (which alerts anyone around).The game has two sneaking buttons, walk and creep. The game tells you to walk over loud surfaces, but later on you'll actually need to creep, because walking ends up being too loud. Crouching avoids all that nonsense.You can climb out of the environment if you find the right place to do so.The hitbox for pickpocketing is really tiny, and that hitbox stays with worn items that fall off of people. Picking items up off the ground is a pain because of it.Deep water instantly kills you. If you slip off a dock because of bad ledge detection, you're a dead man. BLACKJACKThe blackjack is such a bizarrely complicated tool it needs its own problems section.Blackjacks, when used properly trigger a scripted knockout sequence masquerading as normal gameplay. This is a state that is ideal to reach, but you must be standing to do so. Standing is not advantageous because then you start making lots of noise or are more visible. So, the convoluted way to knock someone out in this game is to crouch walk over to them, stand up and stand still, then click and hope that the sequence triggers.Blackjacks don't need the scripted sequence, but it makes it a lot easier.You can't knock someone out who is in an increased state of alert. This is seen in guards as them having their weapon drawn. This is a fine system, but some enemies don't explicitly use weapons, so their alert and idle states look identical, causing lots of infuriating blackjack failures.I don't think you can knock people out who are sitting down. It never worked for me. Chairs are a huge problem because of that.A blackjack hit that is successful makes no blood, but a blackjack hit that isn't successful makes blood. Sometimes guards die when they hit the floor. I think this is because the torch underneath them burns them to death. Either that or they fall on the sword which gives a significant physics impact. Either way, you can tell they died because of the loud scream they emit while unconscious. TOOLSSometimes noisemaker arrows don't make noise.For a grenade, the gas bomb has a ridiculously small area of effect.Arrows do not seem to come out of the center of your view (where the crosshairs are). They have a bit of left-wards bias, so if a column is to your left you have a high chance of hitting that instead, wasting the arrow.Thrown items have this problem but to a ridiculous degree. If your throw is obstructed the game will simply not throw the item, keeping it in your inventory. This is not good when you are trying to gas three people trying to stab you and can't throw the grenade because you weren't turned to the right far enough.Thrown items are thrown underhand, not overhand, with significant force. Most of the time you will hit the ceiling with your item because of how high the throwing arc is. AIThis game is almost completely free of cheating AI, but it has some cheating scenarios.AI can see items through walls, like chairs and tables. This is triggered when searching for you, accompanied with a quote like ""maybe they are by the _____"").If an AI finishes fighting another AI, they will seek out another target a few seconds later. This ignores light level, which means you can be targetted instantly by simply being an observer in complete darkness. LEVELSThe horror level is GREAT for the first half, but there is a specific moment where it turns horribly boring and not scary.A lot of levels take far longer than they should.There are opportunities to use your items in the levels, but they only become important in the last few missions.

												A classic game from a classic series, with updated graphics and a more open city to explore. This is not the best game in the series, but that doesn't mean it isn't great. If Thief 1 & 2 were rated 95-100, this would be a 85-90. Some of the traveling in the city is a bit tedious, but offers more chances to explore and find loot you may of missed. I highly recommend sticking to first person view for the immersion. All three Thief games are excellent and I can not praise them enough.			",105,37,0,12,5,0,2

												Just went and binged the first three games of the Thief series these past 2 monthes. I like the first 2 and the 3rd (this game) stays true to the original 2 games. The story drives forward a story that hasn't been told about keepers who don't like to be known. This game did things that were different, and felt like the more modern twist of what the old could have been. If you've played Dishonored this game is what influenced it. The game is a bit cluckly but true to its era when released (original xbox era) but mods fix up a lot of the issue and make the game more modern. Played with Windows 10 and had a few crashes but never lost progress due to frequent autosaves. Recommend playing the first two games before playing this one but if you don't want to it's fine, just expect to have a few things be unclear or briefly mentioned that are important for individual missions.

												The Thief series are an amazing achievement in the gaming industry, one that offered immersion and satisfaction from every mission that you go through. The Deadly Shadows is the 3'rd game in the series which is a cross-over between what we saw in The Dark Project and The Metal Age, yet now we've got more focus upon a faction that always remained in the shadows, mysterious and unkown - The Keepers.  Once again players take control of Garret, a master thief, one that turned stealth and robbery in an artform. The game also features an interesting sandbox-like experience where you can go around the city and observe the life in town and access missions via this way.I also found myself very welcome even though I started with exactly this title and had no idea of what the previous games held, so you shouldn't be ashamed of this being your starting point... Give it a try.			",136,44,7,18,22,1,32

												Excellent, immersive and hilarious stealth game. You can have so much fun playing this it's awesome. The factions are superbly done, with a wry mix of sardonic and endearing humour, involving and convoluted storyline, open-ended sandbox type missions, free-roam areas, fabulous characters, lots of gadgets and options for style of play.It is similar in style to NOLF (No One Lives Forever) in quite a few ways (another superb game!), although the setting and story of thief is a lot *darker*.I have had the disk version for years, but just recently bought it on steam and enjoying another highly enjoyable playthrough with widescreen support thanks to the sneaky thief mod.

												This is the game that got me into the sneaky / creepy / adventure genre, and I love it.  I grew up watching my brothers play the earlier thief games.  This game deserves a 10/10 for The Cradle level alone, but the museum is also incredible.  The final battle is a bit short and a bit of a let down, but the whole game is awesome.  If they added in a bit more of an open world, I would have given it a perfect 10.  Instead, I will leave it at 9/10.			",22,5,0,6,2,0,2

												If you like a game that has stealthy mechanics and a very good storyline with some kind of anti-hero, this is it, So many years later, this game is still one of my favourite games for each aspect that it beholds, The graphics are a bit outdated, but that doesn't make the game any worse, Still waiting for the follow up it deserves.

												Great game. You are (as the title suggests) a thief, so one of your goal is to steal valuable things. Stealing and hiding in shadows is fun. However what makes this game really entertaining is the plot full of twists and secret societies. Maybe the graphics is not so good and appealing as in most modern games, but various environments are well designed (church, abandoned ship, asylum etc.).			",122,45,0,14,5,1,16

												Another stealth series I would highly recomend! Actually, I think the Thief series was the birth of the ""True Stealh FPS/RPG"" Don't quote me on that, because I can't be sure, but I believe it is one of the first. And, it is almost purely stealth bassed!This is not a game for those that like to run through shooting up everything in sight. In order to progress through this game, you HAVE to sneak around!There are two other games that preceded this one, both well worth playing and both are available on Steam. I had them running on older machines, but wanted them on this one. Fortunately, Steam made them available, capable of running on my Win 7 machine.I'm still waiting for Thief 4 to come out. Eidos had said they were going to produce it back when they started Deus Ex: Human Revalution, but I haven't heard anything new sense then.Anyway, try this, if you like it you might even like the older ones inspite of the older graphics.

												-Suspenseful stealth action game, the classic series-A lot of people just hate this game because 1&2 were beloved classics but the third part is still similar enough and a good game on its own. I think it's still brilliant (also own it off-steam) to play.Setting is a fantasy city with a bit of steampunk for good measure. You play as a thief mostly avoiding combat and try to find the valuables in the level while checking the mission goals. To that end you want to stay in the shadows or walk on carpet as enemies can see or hear you. You can club guards from behind and hide their bodies from the patrol routes of other guards. You have a limited set of tools like flashbombs, water arrows to extinguish torches or moss arrows to place ""carpet"". Levels are mostly open like in Deus Ex and it's fun to find the way around the guards and play hide and seek with them. Also there are a lot of hidden treasures or secret doors to discover. And there are really scary parts too.Can recommend to anyone who likes stealth maybe not for too casual players. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thief: Deadly Shadows is a stealth game developed by Ion Storm Austin, and the successor to Thief: The Dark Project and Thief II: The Metal Age. Ion Storm Austin were the people behind Deus Ex, and later Invisible War, a title with infamy for being inferior to its predecessor and consolized (I haven't played it, so no further comment from me.) The same happens in Deadly Shadows, though not as much: playing the game unmodded you can clearly see that they had to split levels in two halves with loading screens inbetween due to console limitations (and even with Thief 3 Gold - highly recommended - there are some levels where it seems fairly clear that there was a loading screen in certain places (for example, overly long corridors.) The levels themselves are also a bit smaller than the first two games', even when played with T3G.There are also less levels (9 instead of 15), but this time there is a city hub connecting them, divided of 5 city districts. This is a nice addition reminiscent of Deus Ex, but the hubs feel a bit too small, and the fact that equipment persists throughout missions and that you'll always have enough gold to restock on what's left mean you're always fully stocked on everything, which removes a certain element of ""tough choices"" found on the first two games, where in the shop screen you usually don't have enough money to buyout the store.It's also a bit strange that crouched movement is now silent. It does make more sense, Garrett being a master thief and all, but it removes the danger in traversing metal/marble surfaces unless you're an idiot and run around to get anywhere, also removing most of the utility from moss arrows.Enough with the negatives, now. What does Deadly Shadows do well?Graphically it is a great improvement. The game uses the Unreal Engine 2, which looks immensely superior to the low-poly models in the Dark Engine (though, and this is highly subjective - I do prefer the way the first two games look.) The engine can also draw dynamic shadows, which still look great.In terms of gameplay it' mostly the same as previous titles, except now rope arrows have been replaced by climbing gloves (you can climb cobblestone walls), and there is now a lockpicking minigame, which is not as bad as it sounds since it's easy but slightly time consuming. The levels are still fairly good even though most of them aren't as big, and especially the final two levels are quite amazing: the terrifying Shalebridge Cradle, and the large and full-of-loot Wieldstrom Museum. The levels and the city hub also allow you to observe the Hammerites and Pagans in balance at last. In the previous games, there was an imbalance towards either one of the factions, but now the plot revolves around the Keepers. This also means you get to know more about them, either by the main plot or exploring their hidden library. Speaking of plot, it's missing the mission briefing cutscenes, which is a pity, but otherwise it's good, ending with a really cool throwback to the beginning of The Dark Project.In the end, Deadly Shadows is still inferior to the first two games, but very much worth playing anyway.

												Thief: Deadly Shadows (Or, Thief 3) is a game that holds up surprisingly well many years later.Though I've never gotten too far into it, I can safely say the stealth mechanics are refined, and the harsh difficulty makes sure that you don't just go in stabbing everyone in a knife fight.On top of this, the sound design is top-notch, sending various chills down my spine in situations that aren't that way on a visual landscape. The voice acting could be better, the AI is pretty much shows the age of this game, and there are probably allot more issues that I have yet to see if I ever progress any further into this game, but for what it is, I can safely say T:DS lives up to it's predicessors... unlike the unnessacary modern Thief.

												Vast & explorational stealth game, set in a fictional ""City"". You play as a thief named Garrett, tales of his heroics and villainy have flourished within the city (see previous games). Even the warden of Pavelock Prison refers to Garrett as ""master thief"" in this game, in awe of his legendary past.To beat a level, you will need to do two things: do specific tasks, and steal items (sometimes on others' behalf). This is an open-ended game, so you can complete missions in a variety of ways, and finish optional objectives for more cash (or just break into homes and steal paintings & jewelry for cash. 'Nuff said). While doing these keep an eye on your shadow in this game; it can give your hiding position away if you're not careful.This game has a unique aspect that makes it timeworthy; there are clashing factions within the city that can be allied with, who come to your aid should you require it. But they can also be turned against you, resulting in violence whenever you are in sight -- this will make the game a lot harder to complete. Doing the small factional requests is rewarding in the long run.Enough rambling, install this and play. Play it now lads!			",333,103,12,55,22,2,28

												This game does a great job at making the player(s) feel like the first few levels will just be repeats in different map layouts. But When The game introduces zombies, monsters, and horrors the player(s) feel(s) helpless to fight them and will just run away (or a least I did) even though they are still killable. The upgrades are all really helpful and fairly priced. Though the graphics are poor compared to the 2014 Theif, it is still a game I would recommend to people who like the time period the game is set in, a few scares, and some fun stealth gameplay.

												Really solid game that's moddable to make it more at home on the PC. No other game lets you play a thief that goes round mugging people and breaking into establishments and stealing their treasures and selling them off for personal profit.The game is all about old fashioned stealth: sneak around in the shadows, use various tools like lockpicks and water arrows (to extinguish torches), pickpocket people, steal their belongings and generally make the townsfolk poorer whilst you get richer.Lots of varied levels, stealth tools to work with, and also a small city to explore... and to pillage the contents of private chests and to rife the pockets of the hapless population. It's a guilty pleasure to pickpocket someone from the darkness and watch them curse when they find out they've been blagged :)Stealing has never been so fun and thrilling!			",272,22,1,34,18,1,35

												After shifting the balance yet again, Garrett must now seek the hidden truth behind the Keepers prophecies while also stealing some valuables along the way, as he unquestionably did in his previous ventures.The third installment of the Thief series felt, story aside, a lot different than its predecessors, the main reason for this being the fact that, during my playtrough, especially at the beginning of the game, it seemed like I was playing an unreleased game, a game still in the beta phase, but, after getting over the minor inconveniences like some rarely occurring crashes to desktop and the floating in mid-air bug which occurs sometimes while trying to climb using the ""jump"" function, you get to see the beauty of the game, the story which bonds perfectly with the previous games' lore and the new features brought by this new engine they have used, like the improved artificial intelligence and the possibility to explore The City's districts and free-roam, this being a pleasant addition to the characteristic linear gameplay of its predecessors. In addition, another thing to remember is that the Steam Overlay doesn't seem to cooperate with this game. There is a mod called Sneaky Upgrade which could deliver a better experience but note that it comes with its own launcher, incompatible with Steam.Great addition to the series. Even though the developers made it possible to play it without going for the first two I would still suggest to start them in order if you're bent on spending some time on a veteran of the stealth genre. One of its missions, Robbing the Cradle, stands out as one of the most iconic levels in gaming, even in today's standards.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game can be extremely frustrating, I'm not going to lie. If you're impatient like me you end up dying countless times on city streets (you taffer!!!!!!!!) before getting to a mission start. (I cheated prison so many times by just quitting to the title and loading my last save. Heh,) But as I got the gist of this game (see: STEALTH game, duh), I liked the challenge. The strange, dark, magic-tinged story ending up roping me in. I never had the classic Thief expeirence, either, so I don't really have a basis for comparison. For me, this game is an enjoyable ride of stealing, blackjacking innocent bystanders, and killing the witnesses so they don't get the guards (see again: taFFER!!!!), while trying to figure out a whole lot of creepy cult shenanigans. Pros: -Atmospheric, tense gameplay with creepy, heart-pounding moments (zombie ship??? more like NAH SON I'M OUT BYE) (see also: giant rat things?? NOPE)-Multiple ways to tackle most missions, challenging, wide range of gear -Diverse settings for missions with unique sets of characters -Inriguing story -Garret's voice acting Cons:-Glitchy gameplay at times (i.e. floating Garret, getting killed by a guard because I couldn't jump on a freaking ledge to escape, occasionally freezing)-Outdated visuals, if you're turned off by that -Slighlty moronic NPCs, whose dialogue and behavior range from funny/unique to downright predictable All in all, 9/10. I really enjoy this game and spent far too many hours of a single day trying to figure out how many blackjacked corpses I could stack in the shadows before someone discovered me, along with a lot of yelling at my computer (""it wasn't me that time I swear111!!!"" ""did I see somethin--NOPE NOPE YOU DIDN'T"" ""goawaygoawaygoaway"")Finally, I am a horror wimp and almost♥♥♥♥♥♥myself during the stupid freaking insane asylum run.

												This game was AMAZING. It has great atmosphere and has the original games strengths with it's own flair. Even Ric was impressed. The game has it's tense moments and AI can catch new players offguard. You will see familiar gameplay that has inspired many games of the current gen. The graphics aren't the best but anyone who was gaming late 90s and early 00s will love it's old school look. Only issue with this game is it's a tad clunky and lack of boobs. Great Game!!!

												As a Veteran of most of the Genre defining stealth games (Metal Gear Series, Splinter Cell, etc), I can happily say this game captures the heart and core of what makes a stealth game enjoyable. The game mostly consists of you (Garrett the Thief-Man) going from house to house and playing Reverse-Santa, taking everything in the house that isnt bolted down, and assaulting lawful residents into submission. Actually way more fun than it may sound. For a game made well over a decade ago, it still looks decent and will run on just about any computer that can run Windows XP (so basically anything) and the sound isn't bad too. Audio is ok, no audio lag or grainy sounding effects.The controls take some getting used to, and while a controller is nice to use on occasion, customizing the bindings is fairly simple. The overall control of Garrett is pretty decent, noting one special thing that sets this game apart from most First Person stealth games..... You can see your feet position by looking down! Anyway, in a nutshell, this game's pretty fun, looks fine, sounds good and will last you a decent amount of time. Its got some mild online modding options, usually goes on sale for about $4 or so, and is a nice and charming stealth/kleptomania simulator game that has a hearty whiff of the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube glory days.7.5/10 - Would steal another candlestick, and maybe 3 more cups........ and that painting on the wall there........

												Is it blasphemy to like this better than Thief II?I ask because everyone talks about that one being the bomb, but I think Deadly Shadows is much more fun personally.Every change and addition is absolutely welcome. The third person view is really useful, especially for climbing. Lockpicking is better in this one. Arrows are easier to aim with, and I use them a lot more in this one. The little hub is pretty cool too, and it's satisfying to actually go and sell your loot piece by piece.It hasn't aged flawlessly, but this is definitely my favourite of the series so far.Also you can throw dead rats at people.

												There's an element in this game which truly adds to the atmosphere as a whole that nobody seems to mention.And that's Eric Brosius's work as the soundtrack composer.The music in the Thief games has always had a special something -- very memorable, and very in tune with the games' particular aura. Here in Deadly Shadows I believe the soundtrack has reached a subtle completeness and maturity which invites me to listen to it on a regular basis. And when I do, I find myself back in the world of Thief with that feeling of nostalgia and melancholia so appropriately captured in the track ""South Quarter"".Seriously, the man doesn't get enough praise.

												You are a Garrett, a master thief, the best from the best. The shadows are his friend and he steals from the wealthy and gives to himself. He rally Preferring to be left alone but there is always some prophecies. This time of an impending Dark Age whose dictating a different plan for the thief. In his efforts to prevent this approaching Dark Age, he has inadvertently roused an ancient hidden evil. Garrett finds himself standing alone between the City and the forces that would crush it.I love this part of his story the most. Even if last Thief is harder, if you ask me. I have played Deadly Shadows plenty of times, always with Expert, the hardest difficulty and it was very easy for me. No matter what, his story, sense of humor and character, I really always liked Garrett and games with him.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assasin's Creed ain't got nothing on me... I can also climb buildings, sneak around stabbing people (except I don't get de-sync'd for it) I also have a bow that can knock someone out asleep, I have explosive arrows, moss arrows, fire arrows, water arrows and err arrows! I can also carry around a sword... If I want to.Thief deadly shadows is well as the title suggests, you pretty much avoid the law and steal and kill, what more could you want? The graphics are a bit dated and the gameplay can be slow at times but eeeeeh, that's what being a theif is all about not blending in and running from rooftops to rooftops pretending to be a white bard.... I'm more of a well, Thief! Maybe when you've finished riding that dumb horse and throwing money at beggers you'll play me, yes?I recommend this only if you're into stealth games and using your bow... mostly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also to anyone who liked the new THIEF even a bit (i liked it really much but  was dissapontiedbecause it lacked some good features and equipment from the Deadly Shadows)Scenario : barely 7/10Gameplay :  8/10Stealth gameplay : 8.5/10Combat gameplay : 5/10Voice acting and characters conversasions : 10/10Overall : 7,7/10Hours of game : 8 so far for me and still goingGraphics : Terrible for this day but really good for 2004			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most people will find the Thief franchise appalling, the premise it to steal, any shiny object in the game world can be made yours, but you mustn't kill for loot. The second ""worst"" game in the series is technically functional, tense, atmospheric, difficult, inexpensive. I don't have the money for most mainstream or popular titles, so consider this review good if you're as subtle as a mouse. And that's what Garrett is, a clever mouse among thick-o fatcats. Stealing that which people would guard.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the third Thief game and it is the best one. The gameplay is fun. This one is more accessible than the first two so people new to the Thief games, stealth genre or anyone who isn't as skilled can enjoy this game. The City can be explored between missions so people can be pick pocketed, killed, locks can be picked and there are even side quests! Some are difficult to do. Kills are hard to do when the enemy detects you so this isn't just an action game. It takes a few broadhead arrows to kill a guard who knows who you are.Like all Thief games, there is some horror so if you're easily scared or don't like scares, this is a warning. I am not scared when playing survival horror games but there's a level where I was so scared. Garret, the thief, is a likeable character. The story is interesting but gets weird in the middle.This is a great game and I recommend you to buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game because I had already played, and liked, Thief 2014. Unfortunately, I've heard so many fanboys giving the game a hard time. ""It's nothing like the other Thief games, blah blah blah."" So I decided since it was on sale I'd give one of them a try.Visually this game was closer to what I would prefer to play, with Thief Gold coming in at a close second. So far I haven't completed the game, I'm the type who likes to attempt to look in every nook and cranny. But so far, the game is exactly what I expected. And I have absolutely no regrets in getting it. But due to the games age, there have been some minor problems when running it on my computer. Mind you, my computer is a couple of years old already, and is running Windows 8.1 if I remember correctly.First things first, maybe it's due to the settings I have for the resolution, but when loading into a level during the loading screens it flashes to an extremely enlarged version of my desktop for a couple of seconds. So far it doesn't seem to have any effect on the the game or gameplay in general, it's just irritating and unnerving. Second, when the animation for the quest to steal the Pagans claw thing ended the game crashed. I reloaded my save and the game crashed again. I reloaded it one more time, because I really liked the game and was hoping for no more problems, and it worked.Other things I've noticed that show the games age is the sound detection. I dropped a bottle near a door, with the intention of alerting two guys in the other room. Not only were they not alerted, but the moment I started to move away from the door they seemed to ""know"" someone was there. Then there's their inability to see you in the dark, even if they're inches away from you. Or one I really enjoyed, I unintentionally caught the attention of a guy in the Pagan's tunnel. But he eventually gave up looking for me, because I kept trying to ""hide"" behind the crate he kept running into. :') Then there's the character models, you don't notice it so much with the guys. But for whatever reason, most of the women in the stone market look like Black Market Bertha. It's a little weird.Personally, just based off what I've experienced in this game so far, I don't think Thief 2014 is all too different. The story and characters in Deadly Shadows is way better, but the maps have the same amount of vagueness and ability to confuse and frustrate. With the newest Thief being slightly better in that regard. The loot is definitely better in Deadly Shadows, though it has a smaller variation of loot. And if I remember correctly there aren't any guaranteed designated ""special loot"" in Thief 2014. They both seem to have the same general feel of ""free roam"" looting. By that I mean you can loot this house or building on the way to your quest location, but that particular place isn't and never will be a quest location. The only difference being, if I'm not mistaken, is that there aren't random shops to loot in Thief 2014. And Deadly Shadows array of random places to loot is small. You also need to be much more careful with your use of weapons in Deadly Shadows. While you can buy more, once you run out in the middle of a quest the chances of finding more are a bit slim.All in all, I'm really enjoying the game. I highly recommend getting the game, especially if it's on sale. If you're having any doubts about whether it'll play on your computer, because I believe some of the negative reviews have merit, check the community hub. There may be solutions there that will help.P.S. I may have forgotten some things, or if anything changes, I will update this with that info. Though I doubt I'll be changing my recommendation.

												Yes it's the weakest of the first three Thief games but with mods it's quite a good game, and in a few respects the best of the Thief games. It has the best storytelling by far. The new mechanics are a mix of good and bad. The shadow system is more accurate but the blackjacking is terribly clunky and requires you to line up shot directly from behind which will fail and probably ruin your plan if the target pivots at the last second. On the other hand the ability to switch into third-person perspective gives things a more realistic feel and is tactically useful (although rather cheap because it lets you see around corners). The leaning is useless.The levels are not bad. By my count three of them are mediocre and six of them are good to outstanding. Many people think one of them is the best Thief level of all time.I think the real problem, after you mod out the loading zones, is with the hub city. Often it's good and adds a lot of nice (though completely unnecessary) mini side-quests. But at other times it's just a nuisance having to go through two or three transitions and avoid a handful of patrolling guards just to get to your next mission. It also never feels like a real world. It's too small and the NPCs are too obviously just spawned NPCs.  On balance the formula of the original Thief games worked better. All missions with no filler. Anyway the reason I'm writing this review is because I think this game has an undeservedly low reputation. It rounds out the trilogy well and should have been the basis for a much better 3D Thief game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Deadly shadows may be the lesser of the 3 thief games, but It still rates high on a game you should play. But I would also tell you to play theif one and two as well. they are sneak-em-up action games well worth playing for their storyline and ever evolving game play. Deadly shadows is only the lesser in game play because they made a stupid move to put it on consoles as well. instead of giving them diffrent codings we lost many abilities like being able to swim and clim ropes and so forth, as well as some stability in some places. That said the odd glith here and there (many are funny as heck to explit when running from guards and so forth). If you want to use a joy pad i would advise you to hunt out a good emulator as there seems to be issues with setting joy pads for game play in this steam edtion of the game as it crashes when you try to set them. I had no problems on the old CD copy I have myself but since getting it for steam there seems to be a few bugs still in need of fixing, but its still early days for it on steam so it may yet get fixed. just google theif deadly shadows version 1.1 joypad problems.

												An old classic from the PSone days and will play very well on any low spec system. Pick pockets or knock people out your choice! Kill if you want to! LOL :-D.It is the only thief game I know of that let's you use your bionic eye. This game is a must buy in my opinion!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thief 3: Deadly Shadows was a brave attempt by a declining Ion Storm Austin to create a worthy sequel and ending to an amazing trilogy. On paper, they did everything right. They got the vast majority of Looking Glass Studios staff on-board to make it, they swapped technology to the Unreal Engine and set out to make the series more appealing to a broader audience. The end result however, was a different story.In Thief 3, Garrett is once again the lovable misanthropic protagonist, stealing and hiding his way through another adventure. As expected, you will visit a wide variety of interesting locations and settings to foil yet another attempt to destroy The City.The story of the game is incredibly well written and maintains the high standard of story telling that Looking Glass prided themselves in writing. The musical score and general ambience is handled by Eric Brosius and, as expected, the atmosphere is just as gripping as it was in the previous games.Instead of playing mission after mission like in the previous games, the game is based around a 'hub' system; Garrett will have to make his way from his apartment through The City's streets to his next chosen objective, all the while keeping an eye out for pockets to pick or people to mug. Just make sure the City Watch aren't around before you attempt to hold someone up in the street. You'll need to visit fences around The City who will sell your stolen goods for you and shops to buy the equipment you'll need for your next mission.The game plays out over the course of 9 days. Each day, you'll have to leave your place of residence and explore the streets. Each day will bring something different so it encourages you to investigate areas you've previously explored to find things to steal or to find new story elements. You'll be exploring a City that has largely recovered from the aftermath of Thief 2 and is slowly sliding back into a more magical steampunk state, visiting grand cathedrals, mansions, museums, libraries and, of course, The Cradle.If you've never heard of this legendary level, the game is worth purchasing for this level alone. I won't go into too much detail about it but I'll say this... It's an amazing horror experience that will have you terrified from beginning to end.The AI is both much improved over previous games but incredibly stupid at times. They'll remember past events and people they've met in the streets, monsters or otherwise. They'll remember if they've been robbed, found bodies in the street or seen blood on the floor and run away if they're outnumbered. Unfortunately they'll end up trying to hide in the middle of the street or accuse you of crimes you may not have committed.There is some top quality voice work in here too especially for the monsters. The monsters up close sound so creepy that it'll send shivers down your spine!For all its good points however, this game has some major problems. Thanks to this game being primarily designed for the Xbox and it's 64MB of RAM, the levels of the game, whilst being incredibly detailed for the time, are small, cramped, fairly linear and had to be split up into sections so the Xbox could cope. The PC port truly got shafted by this decision.Ion Storm Austin also, for some insane reason, decided to take their completely butchered version of the Unreal Engine they used for Deus Ex 2 and made Thief 3 with it, albeit with some drastic improvements. The engine was a pretty damn impressive renderer for the time and does great dynamic lighting but performance wise, it was terrible. It runs fairly well on the PCs of today though but, back in 2004, you were lucky to see even 30 FPS on the most powerful of computers of the day.Overall, it's a satisfying end to a trilogy that was truly amazing from start to finish. Even though Thief 3 is considered the weakest of the series, it has its good points and I can highly recommend it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Deadly Shadows is a more streamlined game than the first two with much smaller levels and because it uses the same engine as Deus Ex Invisible War it has different areas of a level separated by loading screens which takes the feeling away of the levels being these giant, realistic, lived in locations. There are some changes that make the gameplay better like hitting someone with a blackjack is easier and less clunky, the addition of an actual lock picking system and the bow feels smoother to use. The game is very buggy though with the main bug that occurs very often was being stuck in midair after jumping which gets really annoying. The story is just as decent as the other two and it brings a nice conclusion to Garrett’s story. Today I feel like Deadly Shadows is just an average stealth game because I feel like the genre has progressed since but it is still an average stealth game that is worth playing because it does bring the Thief story to a solid conclusion.  5/10 (Average)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My favorite of the Thief saga and one of my favorite stealth games. Deadly Shadows once again thrusts Garrett the Thief into a sinister plot to take over the world using terrible magic. Using his wide-array of tools and his wits, Garrett must thwart the plan and make a bit of money on the side. Deadly Shadows boasts 3rd Person View, well-defined shadows, a city hub rife with foes and easy marks, and several unique missions that can be solved in a multitude of ways. Add Garrett's trademark cynicism into the mix and you have a fantastic game. Buy this thing NOW. I mean it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Skip to the bottom if you want a more easily digestable recommendation, aka its good.I keep realising how bad some of my old reviews are so i'll edit this simply to not cringe in advance, as well as to give you actual insight on what you might like about this game. Actual review No.2if you are looking for victorian settings in gaming then i can safely say this is the best i've seen so far, better yet! its one of my favorite stealth games as well, not to say it doesn't have flaws...thief games constantly get the credit they deserve for how they demonstrate the victorian period of history, how pretty and detailed the architecture, the vestiment, and even the licanthropy and fiction the games showcase, so many years after release and it still holds a strong impression of how life was like during that era, the illustration of this concept becomes memorable thanks to music, the design of the city and the way it foreshadows its progression as you explore the city, most common examples of this are the cradle, the hammerite level and the one in a mansion, outside of the city itself, in fact it seems as though this is a running theme on the series and shows the hard work that was put into these games. even if the actual illusion gets broken from time to time by the clunky, mechanical AI, i'd like to comment on how i enjoy this in an ironical sense. i like seeing it as a victorian city, fillied with animatronics. conceptually epic, but it detracts from the experience due to how lifeless it actually feels. Gameplayif you've ever played an elder scrolls game, then you know what you're getting into with this game, as its part of that trio of games, that are basically TES, but more polished but without the Open Worlds bethesda puts into their games. want better combat? then dark messiah! better magic? arx fatalis...(morrowind)but again, while its more polished in some aspects, it still suffers from most of the issues the elder scrolls suffers from, that includes garbage, lifeless AI, clunky mechanics, occational crashing and bugs. but the reason people love these games is because, somewhere hidden under all these technical issues, there's a fun. innovative game that still holds up to this game, if any of these things bother you then you can always mod these games because PC master race. (that's just the way it is around here) RecommendationIf you can get past how often this game screams to you ""Old!!get the new one insteadXDDD""then you'll find a replayable game with fun mechanics and a strong sense of design, if the victorian setting interests you then give it a shot. for stealth game fans this is a must, and if you played a stealth class in the elder scrolls you'll feel at home as its basically a glorified thieves guild.

												First, go and download all the patches plus Thief 3 Gold, which combines the broken up levels. Yeah, Thief: Deadly Shadows suffered the same fate as Deus Ex: Invisible war... Broken up into many loads screens to the first Xbox.As for the game itself, it took me about 17ish (It says 19 on Steam, but 2 or so hours of it was a play thru months ago that only got to the second level, plus all the time it took to get the new patches running) hours to finish, and the levels, on average, lasted about 30~50minutes. This is a huge difference between both Thief Gold and Thief 2, which both took a solid 25 and 28 hours to finish; and on average, the levels lasted anywhere between 1 hour and 1 hour 45 minutes. The levels in Thief: Deadly Shadows are notoriously smaller.Gameplay wise, it's harder to do combat face on (Go figure), and everything else has been improved. Sure, it moves like♥♥♥♥♥due to the new engine, but the interface works a lot better than the first two Thiefs, plus I like seeing my own shadow and pressing up agaisnt walls. Unfortnuately, rope arrows have been removed and replaced with a weird wall climbing ability. Yeah, it's weird and slightly broken. Again, levels are smaller so... It doesn't feel like Thief. There's also a very broken faction system, and I'll just leave it at that.The only new edition is the hub which doesn't work because of how little there is to explore and why bother? Missions give so much loot... That you have to personally sell to vendors in the city. Sounds nice, at first, but gets very tedious when the guards and lack of hiding spots gets in the way. Now the kicker: Should you buy it? After you install the mods, it's only worth it if you want to see the story arch with Garrett end. Chances are, you've already played Thief Gold and Thief 2 in order, so it only makes sense to see how it ends with Garrett in Thief: Deadly Shadows.As for the 2014 Thief, ♥♥♥♥ that...

												***UPDATE***After a short search on the internet. I found this forum that offers an unofficial patch that will fix the lockpicking bug on Windows 10.... amung other bugs (For which I haven't encountered........yet.... anyways)  Changing the rating back to good (anticipating the patch will work)http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=138607I played this game years ago when it first came out. Sadly, my computer crashed and I lost my saved game and only recently came back to it. I was very excited to see it on Steam.I am running Windows 10 and the game seemed to run great at first....I ran into a snag (bug) when it came to lock picking... :-( Unfortunately, you cannot progress through this game with this bug. It makes it unplayable.... at least on Windows 10... Maybe it works on older OS's, ...I don't know....:-(Great game, be nice to play it.... But since I can't because of this issue.... I have to give it a thumbs down. :-(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First Thief I ever played and though it is regarded as maybe worst of the series, it is still pretty amazing game. The difficulty is not based on how much hp you or enemies have, but on how good you play the game, find and steal everything that is in the level. Between missions there is a city to explore and rob as you please. Dark and gritty atmosphere of mildly steam-punk world is really enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, I prefer Thief : Dark project and Metal age. The third is not as good as previeous two games.The map size is smaller than metal age and there is some bugs.But, Deadly shadow is still good game.Good stealth system, Dynamic shado rendering, Trying new things in game.(Personally, I like Shalebridge Cradle in this game.)as thief fan, this is dissapoint game, but, Itself quiet solid game.ps. If you want working well. You should patch with Unofficial Patch The Sneaky Upgrade.http://www.moddb.com/mods/thief-3-sneaky-upgrade/downloads ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Was at the peak of games during its time and still out does other modern ones. The Thief series is kinda the basis of stealth games now - much like how Morrowind ""set the standards"" for other RPG games - as you'll come to find Dishonored being very similar to it. It's an oldie but a goldie. Sure I have 3 hours of gameplay on steam, but i've finished the game 3 times on the Xbox, never gets old.Graphics- 2.99/5, Sure other people dislike the old graphics styles - but I'm not other people! In time you'll come to respect the atmosphere of the early 2000sGameplay- 4/5, Very solid, very fluid, very skill-requiring; all things that make this game all the better. As I've said before, ""set the standards"" for stealth games.Story- 4.1/5, Not much to say here, very intriguing. Has journal entries with lots of detail that you don't even have to read thanks to Garrett's voice.Score- 11.09/15Overall Personal Rating- 3.9/5 = Give this game a go, it's not like it's cheap or anything...

												I played a lot of the Thief games when they first came out and Deadly Shadows was probably my favorite. Everything about the game itself is awesome so I figured I would give it another run when I saw it on sale. Here is why I am not recommending this game in its current form: the game by itself is basically unplayable on Windows 10 due to all of the bugs. In order to even play the game, the sneaky upgrade mod must be installed. Even then, there is still a lot of stuff that is broken. For example: the in game brightness controls do not work so I am having to turn up the brightness and contrast on my monitor to 100% so that I can maneuver around some of the darker parts of the game. If the bugs were fixed, I would give a thumbs up but until then, I would avoid playing with Windows 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a real thief game should be. Much better than the first ones. The graphics are better and so are the levels. The levels are tighter, filled with more interesting things, and aren't hollow giant areas. This eliminates much of the wandering around with no clue.  The levels have better atmosphere, and the lighting is looks better too. There is also a better job with actually telling you what you need to do. There are still some problems. The knocking out is very spotty. Sometimes it won't knock out or kill someone if they are looking for you even if they haven't seen you and you are behind them. This makes no sense as the only way to draw them to the dark is make some noise so they come over. You can never tell if the attack will work. Sometimes if you are in front, or on the side, or 2/3 behind them it won't work and they will start attacking you. This makes no sense because of you surprise attack someone in the head in the dark, even if it isn't exactly behind them, it will do the same thing. Similarly you can shoot them in the head with an arrow and sometimes it will kill in one hit but if they are on the lookout it wont.........(?) Also you can never tell if you are close enough to hit them or not. The sound can be spotty too and you can't tell if they will be able to hear you or not. It is annoying how you have to go find the store to sell and buy things with how confusing the towns are and how your map tells you nothing. It would be better if you sold and bought stuff before each mission like in  the old days. All in all it is a better game, except still the supernatural creatures take some of the fun out of it. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I almost always respect designers for trying new things and attempting to improve each release in a series of games.  Unfortunately, the changes we saw when moving from the original two Thief games to Thief: Deadly Shadows were very poorly chosen and executed.In general, the game was a bit of a mess, with some of the biggest issues revolving around:- An ""explorable"" hub world with somewhat linear individual missions, rather than the reverse.- The existance of factions and alignments.- Movement mechanics.- An abundance of bugs and glitches.It was not the game Thief fans had hoped for, and isn't even a well-made game in general.  *sigh*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The last game in the Thief series, before its reboot, and I just can't play it. I have played all three of the games in order, without ever having played any of them before. To make matters short, at least at the front of this review, the only game I like out of the three is Thief II, though I only really enjoyed about 60% of that game and found the rest of it rather lackluster.As my other reviews say, the first Thief was good in virtually everything except for the level design, which killed it for me. The second game continued with all of the proper mechanics and had much better levels, at least for 60% of the game (as said above). This game, however, has much more issues with it than just the levels.Firstly, the game is terribly optimized with a horrible engine. From the start of the game, I had this weird stuttering issue where the camera would essentially shake as I looked around, bugging my eyes. Even with patches and such, the problem still occurred, though eventually it vanished for some weird reason. Regardless, that ended up just foreshadowing everything else I would have problems with in the game.The game even just crashed multiple times for me, for what reasons I could never tell. I never had either of the first two games crash or freeze (nor did System Shock 2).The levels themselves take a relatively long time to load. Now, I'm not an impatient person, and I understand if the level is initially loading up for the first time, but even just reloading a save I made 10 seconds ago will end up taking nearly 1 minute or more to load. The game first just goes to a black screen for about 20 seconds, then it will go to a loading screen, and finally get back to the level. But the weird thing is, about 50% of the time I would load a save or a new area would start up, the game would do a weird ""freeze."" The level would render but there would be no sound, and I couldn't move, attack, look around, jump, or do anything at all. What is odd is that the level would ""start"" in a halfway manner. For instance, at the beginning of the second mission, I could see subtitles of the guards talking outside, but the sound wouldn't play. Then about 20 seconds or more later, I could finally move and the sound would start, in the middle of their conversation. This happened in any place that I would load or enter.In terms of the controls, nothing is smooth. Just walking straight would have the game become choppy occasionally, but not because of a frame-rate drop. Getting near walls, even several inches away, would sometimes cause me to stop moving properly at the same speed. Leaning left and right is terribly slow and choppy. Jumping feels like you are disconnecting and reconnecting yourself via a chain to the ground. The third person isn't really anything well done. And of course, I ended up no-clipping through some walls in a few places and dying.Even attacking isn't proper. The very first guy I went up to in the second mission, I tried to use the blackjack on him. I was standing exactly behind him and never moved, and it took FIVE times for the blackjack to connect and knock him out. The first four times it just swung and nothing happened. I didn't bother moving, nor did I look at a different angle. I just stood exactly still and it missed four times, while neither of us moved.Further, just in the second mission, the game made me lose my controls multiple times as well. I don't know what made it occur, but twice when I was walking around, the game suddenly disabled my ability to creep, crouch, jump, or press against the walls. I could still walk and run, and I could still swing weapons or shoot arrows, but anything that required me to change my stature or get off the ground wouldn't work and I had to reload.In terms of looks, the graphics are somewhat better drawn, but they look more dull and less life-like. They don't render properly either, often flickering or disappearing throughout the level. The compass and visibility marker at the bottom is ugly; the menus are worse in design, and it is silly that things like options aren't available unless you quit the game. Big shining objects and doors are annoying.The game is missing some interesting items such as the Rope Arrow. The lockpicking is really nothing better than before. I thought it was better at first, because it was more interactive instead of just waiting, but in reality, you just twirl the mouse while clicking over and over. The only thing remotely better is the inventory as you can see the items as you swap through them, instead of trying to remember where a given item is in the list.Then you have the AI which is dumber than the first two games. I saw multiple guards walking into walls repeatedly. One even got onto a set of stairs, then went down 3 steps, back up, then back down, over and over in circles. Even more funny, in the City Hub, I knocked out random civilians and people just walked by them as if nothing was there.That's another thing... the City Hub. I thought it was going to be an interesting addition, but in fact, it isn't really. The areas I explored weren't that big, and there's only like 5 doors you can go into at a given time anyway. Essentially, it seems it only exists to add more roadblocks between you and your next mission, including having to repeatedly return to sell loot and buy new items (though I understand that more so). But really, it is a boring stopping point between missions.Now, despite my complaints with the first two Thief games, as I said, I thought Thief II was the best (which seems the general consensus) and I really enjoy the story and world atmosphere. However, I think the interior of the games actually ruin those things, for the most part. I didn't even get far enough into this game to see where the story was going, because of all of the above issues; but I finished both of the first two Thief games, even though I nearly hated the first one because of its levels.This game was easily the worst of the three overall, and I just can't put myself through anymore of it. Next, I will try my luck with the Thief reboot, though I already hear many people hate it. Here is hoping there are some better things done with it in comparison to Deadly Shadows.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wanted to like this game, I really did. Stealth games are my♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I've always thought that they are more immersive and fun from the First Person viewpoint. I spoiled myself on Dishonored, watching through it in it's entirety before actually ever playing it, so I never got the chance to truly enjoy it. Because of this, aside from reading a few rave reviews, I went into this game completely blind. I was hoping to be surprised, and I can't say that I wasn't. Only a minute in, and the annoyingly slow run-speed of my character had already begun to irritate me. The graphics were a minor annoyance, as to be expected in a game this old, but the enviroments themselves seemed bland and lifeless. Upon reaching a ladder, my character proceeds to dry hump it repeatedly instead of actually climbing it. Eventually, I managed to overcome the incredible obstacle, and was able to continue onwards. Until, the game simply shut off. I didn't know what had happened. Had the game crashed? I tried booting it up again, but steam claimed it was already running. After about a minute, a new window of the game opened. Now, I've played a lot of older games. In fact, over 75% of the games I own come from the 90's. But never before had I seen a game that loaded by shutting down and then starting a new window. Being of a mind to go into game design myself, I was baffled as to why anyone would ever use THAT as a method of level loading. But even then, I was not deterred. Obviously, the rave reviews I had heard for this game had to have some basis. I continued on through the tutorial, which I was beginning to become quite sick of. For a game that had been flaunted as allowing you multiple ways through a scenario, this game had only allowed me an extremely linear set of options so far. After thirty minutes of slow-walking, I made it through the tutorial. Finally, I was free to play the game! I loaded the next level and decided to see if I could possibly take a more lethal approach. I attempted to snuck up behind a guard and stabbed him... Which is apparently not an instant kill. Having alerted every guard within an 100 mile radius, I decided to simply let them kill me so I could restart the level. After all, I had to assume the game had saved my progress automatically since I was offered no option to do so myself. I assumed wrong. There didn't seem to be a saving system of any kind, and I was sent back to the beginning of the tutorial. Unwilling to waste another 30 minutes of my life, I uninstalled the game and was thankfully able to get a refund from steam.So, to anyone reading this, don't waste your money on this game. Ignore all the rave reviews claiming it to stand the test of time. It does not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review will be amended as I play through the game. If you strongly disagree with any material in the review, please leave a comment on my profile and we can discuss it further.The first thing you notice about Thief: Deadly Shadows are the load screens. These are understandable, given the higher level of graphical detail in this installment and being a home console release, but they are a bit disorienting compared to the much quicker load times of the previous installments. What's more noticeable are the various gameplay and story text blurbs included on these screens. For a series which previously established a noticeable lack of handholding the player, being reminded that you can knock enemies out with the blackjack is insulting.But once you arrive at the title screen the problems really begin to pile up. There's no option to view the intro this time around, instead forcing players to idle at the title screen for a short time before the intro starts (more on it later). The carefully designed pre-rendered mechanical background has also been abandoned for a 3D Thief logo rotating Deus Ex-style against a 2D background. The background depicting the City lit up at night during a thunderstorm is also questionable. If I had to guess I'd say that the setting or story of Thief: Deadly Shadows is more nature-oriented, maybe revisiting the Pagans or some impending conflict judging by the storm.The intro is noticeably lazier this time around, recycling a large amount of story art from the previous two games, as well as failing to provide any art that's relevant to the story in Deadly Shadows. The motion capture used during the action scene looks noticeably worse than what was seen in previous games, and the cheesy loot-collection jingle used during a cinematic made me roll my eyes.In the options screen the ways in which Thief: Deadly Shadows restricts freedom for the players rears its head. There's no rope arrow, and the default binds for the various arrow types are different than the defaults for the previous two games. Forward leaning, an important part of collecting loot, is removed entirely, and the option to move forward slowly is gone as well. A button to toggle between a first and third person view exists as well, just so you know how much this game panders to a console audience.The briefing screen has undergone a number of changes from it's previous iteration. Players can now perfom tasks while listening to the brief at the same time. This isn't really much of an improvement, since in the previous games briefings could simply be skipped with a button press. The briefings run for longer than in previous games and without the snappy editing and accompanying art they can be quiet boring to listen to on their own. There's no equipment to buy, and players are already told the explicit limit of what they can carry rather than just a large black box to group things in. An extra difficulty option has been added, and players can manipulate various difficulty factors such as AI behaviors.From the first moments of gameplay is when Thief: Deadly Shadows makes some of its strongest impressions on the player. Since it's a sequel running on a new engine the first moments of the game will have to work hard to offset whatever difficulties people have to adjusting to the new engine. Deadly Shadows manages to accomplish this poorly, by asking the player to walk, showing motion that feels extremely restrictive. You can even switch to 3rd person to see how ridiculous Garret's walking animation is.The tutorial level is a joke, plain and simple. The amount of handholding and bottlenecking the game does to introduce things to the player is a complete departure from how the series has operated before. Placing the player into situations devoid of tension do little to actually teach them about real gameplay.Also no freeview while climbing ladders. lol at the nonexistent range on the blackjack and the bow taking up most of the view.game has crashed multiple times within my first time playing, uninstalliing, dogshit game.

												A clumsy game. Movement physics akin to wading through mud, a recurrent jumping bug and obnoxious level transitions destroy any momentum this game could have had. Ion Storm couldn't get right something that Looking Glass Studios mastered four years before them. Curiously, after the technical disaster of Deus Ex: Invisible War, Ion Storm did not think not to use the same engine, warts and all, for Thief: Deadly Shadows. There is a third person mode and a first person mode. In an attempt to create two cameras, neither is particularly well implemented. The first person camera is tied to Garrett's model, and his animations are awkward and twitchy, which could easily induce motion sickness in some players. You will return to the City hub repeatedly after each mission. Each time, you will have to sneak through the same areas, around the same City Watch guards, patrolling the same paths. Ion Storm somehow did not realize this would instantly become incredibly tedious. Movement while crouching is absurdly slow, meaning to get around you will want to stand up and run. I cannot express in words how unbelievably braindead this idea is. Furthermore, it is now impossible to keep pace with a guard while crouching, so in order to pick his pocket you will need to stand up and run. Blackjacking is strangely convoluted: when you are behind someone, standing, the guard isn't searching, Garrett is raising his hand and the blue moon aligns, you might trigger a scripted knockout sequence. Otherwise you'll just have given the guard a friendly tap over the head that alerted him to your presence. Guards will notice when you put out lights, discouraging you from ever using water arrows. Garrett makes no sound at all when creeping or crouched, so there is almost never any reason to use moss arrows. As a result of this, you will most likely never spend any of the gold you can now accumulate over the course of the game. I finished the game with some 25,000 unspent gold and a full inventory of items I never used. At least in Thief 1 and Thief 2 I would spend all my gold on items I wouldn't use since there were no item caps and gold did not carry over between levels. A braindead lockpicking minigame that you will repeat over and over and over again. It locks you in place, so you cannot quickly check your surroundings without awkwardly fumbling out of the lockpicking minigame. Loot now sparkles, so you do not have to look around to find it. The climbing gloves are a poor man's substitute to rope arrows. Often you will try to climb a stone surface only to find that it is blocked off by an overhang, if you can even climb the surface at all—it seems as though the rules for which surfaces you can climb are not very consistent. Garrett has apparently forgotten how to swim, and simply drowns instantly upon making contact with water. Why in the ever living ♥♥♥♥ would the loading zones prompt you whether you want to move to the next area with a yes/no choice? I moved into the loading zone, I obviously want to load the next area. Do not ask me twice, you are not a Windows GUI.Expect problems even with the Sneaky Upgrade, as the Thief: Deadly Shadows engine is poorly optimized. I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sadly this thief game is just not as good as previous installments. It gave up a lot of its core gameplay machanics for newer, shinier graphics. Although it is riddled with bugs, I still believe Theif: Deadly Shadows a good game (at heart), but I just don't feel right reccomending this game since it just isn't as good as the others. (Not including the new one.)I originally said ""It gave up a lot of its core mechanics"". What I meant by this is that the game is ♥♥♥♥ing broken. The AI barely works, you can stand in front of them and they won't see you. This one may have just been me, but the camera was very janky and hard to control. Guards can be pushed with noise arrows, and the flying glitch (while hilarious) is unacceptable even for the time this game came out in.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a bad game, but has aged terribly and there are far more rewarding alternatives out there.This game has a lot in common with Deus Ex: Invisible War, which was made by the same developers and is based on the same engine. It's really not suited to open-ended environments and it shows in this game. About half your computer's power is spent trying to draw shadows and as a result, the levels themselves are too small and 'boxed in' to give this game the free-roaming sandbox feel that it's trying to achieve.I can't fault the atmosphere in this game. It's very dark and eerie, right down to Garrett's growling voice and background ambience when reading books. There are subtle prods towards cults and witchcraft and you find yourself in some very unfriendly places as the game progresses. It comes to a climax with 'the Cradle', the penultimate level of this game which is deemed to be one of the spookiest levels in a game, ever.However, the core gameplay is flawed. Moving about the world is a clunky experience. I like how you can look down and see your body, and that you can pull yourself up onto things, but I still felt disjointed and distant from the world. It just doesn't feel quite right. This extends to the combat, lockpicking and every bit of this game.There are occasional flashes of brilliance, like when I discovered another thief who I found breaking into the place I was sneaking about in. Running away from guards / black figures (COUGH Cradle) is a nerve-wracking experience and discovering hidden treasure makes me happier than I should be.This game is a very odd relic, stuck in an awkward transition period between old and new-style games. At the time, you could consider it a quirk of the game or assume that you were doing something wrong. Sadly, it just isn't worth playing today. Play Dishonored instead while you're waiting for Thief 4 to be released.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I found it to be pretty dull. The inability to run and the general slugishness of the movement made interacting the maps dificult. It sounds like all of the guards are being played by Gilbert Gottfried or Wallace Shawn, with dialog written for a childrens cartoon, which kept me from ever feeling any real tension or even caution.The fighting mechanics were all but nonexistant, the plot seemed terribly dull, the enviroment was dull, the music was dull, and the lock mini-games were pointless; lockpicking didn't provide any risk or challenge - as in the Elder Scrolls, for example - but rather it was just moving the mouse around and drifting half asleep.

												This game is hilariously bad.  Like, it's the video game equivalent of The Room or Uwe Boll's House of the Dead.  It has so many of the classic stealth game tropes, where guards will find a dead body, become alarmed for 3 seconds, before returning to patrol and idly whistling.  You will watch guards swing swords nowhere near your body but you will take damage anyway.  You will watch pedestrians accidentally path into each other and struggle for minutes as they attempt to bypass each other, occasionally triggering generic bystandard talk as they walk in place, face to face with each other.

I tried the widescreen mod but that just made it worse. Like 10-15 fps. The readme file warns that your graphics card neeeds a laughable 256 mb of memory to play.

And its extremely unrealistic and easy. The AI in this game are stupid and just wander around like forest gump. They cant even see you from like 20ft away even if you are standing right in the light.If you want a real sneak game try death to spies, there are hundreds of lifelike guards that can spot you from a very long distance away			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Perhaps those that play this game remember it La Vie En Rose. For the layman, that means that this game is not that good. It's mechanics are broken (blackjack works 1/4 the time, freezes while trying to jump on a box in front of him like a moron, turning corners while crouched was stilted), light sources go through walls, badly programmed (choose between bloom and AA? uh, ok) and it really is boring. You can literally stand right in front of someone and they wont see you till you are behind them and swinging a club at their head, then they take the club like a champ and go into alert mode. However, they dont inform anyone else of their findings. I stole a mission item and the guy who owned it said ""someone stole it"" and promptly went back to walking in circles. He was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that some guy would take it and then it is stolen and he goes ""♥♥♥♥ it, I havent walked around this hallway enough times, I'll get to that later"". I shot a chick in the face with an arrow. She ran away. Tried to jump through a window and the guy acts like I'm telling him to fly. Jump? Out this window? How about I just leap in place and alert everyone around me intsead? Great. ANY other game with stealth elements made in the same era is better. I was legitimately sad to not to like this as every reviewer in gaming history thought this game was the pinnacle of stealth gameplay. Yah, if you dont play any other games. Perhaps compared to what came out AT THE TIME but that would be a stretch because i could probably find a dozen games i would rather play than this. Purchase at your own risk. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An excellent staple of the Stealth Genre, Thief: Deadly Shadows is a game wherein you play Garett, an experienced thief who makes his fortune off of the work of others. The game has robust and intriguing characters, a reactive environment and surprisingly realistic stealth, and an overall enjoyable thrill of thievery and sneaking around.There are some things, however, that make this game awful. First is mostly a technical issue of screen problems and spontaneous lag, although this can be fixed with patches or some tweaking of the files. Not a dealbreaker.The combat's sluggish and unappealing; it doesn't flow well at all. Which, to be fair, it's not supposed to (stealth game, and all, that dagger's a last resort), but even when forced into combat, Garett really can't do much.And then there's the issue of your game completely wiping your save files when you try to save. No warning or reason, it will crash on the save screen and wipe your current saves. That being said, you can download save files from the internet and continue as you wish, but honestly, doing a lot of hard, sneaking work, going through the first few chapters and getting the game down, and then it wipes your saves?Do not buy this game. It's one of the few fun games in existence, yes, but with the technical issues stated above, it's clearly not worth the buy. Unfortunate.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thief Deadly Shadows is a stealth paced game where you play as Garret the Thief.... but you already know that and you don't care about what the game is about so STOP POSTING THE GAME IN THE REVIEW AREA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I love this game!!!  I was expecting this game to just have like 15 levels of the same thing where there is no free roam what - so - ever but!It totally blew my mind!The first and second one was awful but what would you expect from a game made more than 10 years ago...I highly reccomend playing this game and beating it!Don't buy the game and play like 4 levels and stop playing it because that is what idiots do :)But you don't care about this review you just care about if it is a thumbs up or down and if there are more thumbs up then downs taht means the game is good so whoever does that is a idiot and doesn't know how to read :)-ClankyPumpkinPS: Clanky is not a dirty word so shut the **** up and stop messaging me saying that my name is stupid.

Skulking through dismal levels, waiting for minutes while the guard goes to sleep, navigating the world without a goal indicator, and then triumphantly completing a level without being seen, or fighting anyone!

												One of my favorite Thief Games.While one and tow were great as well, I always found this one personally more enjoyable.Great Stealth, a game that actually lets you play w/o forcing you one way or another.  You have the true feeling of freedom to choose your path and playstyle.Nothing beats replaying these old missions for that perfect play-thru.  No Knockouts, 100% loot, and no witnesses.Then there is the orphanage level. One of the Best.Give it a try. Then get the other 2 Originals.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's not the games' fault though.But from what i've played, i can say this is a big step to what is was before in the previous Thief games. 4 years after the second game they came up with this. Wonderful graphics, A.I and gameplay. It suprises me how good it looked and felt. It's all new and fresh, but that didin't made it worse. The sneaking is a lot of harder then it in the previous 2 Thief games due the better A.I. It's sad i couldn't play it 'till the end because of the crashes, but otherwise i can say it is an awesome game which i defentily reccomend. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow, I was pleasantly surprised at this game. The gameplay is great and the graphics in the game are quite good if you run the sneaky patch. I would give the game a 8/10. Previous to this I played Far Cry 2 and I have to say that this game was a lot more enjoyable to me. The stealth aspects are quite good and not overly difficult to pull off. The voice acting kinda sucks and the scenes in the game are cartoony and not great graphics but the gameplay and plot are great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best stealth games I've ever played and continuously proves this by adding new gameplay elements of stealth throughout the progression of its story.Pro's+ Lengthy and suspensful storyline with a perfect ending.      (Perfect in the sense that I don't need to see a sequal with the same protagonist).+ Memorable moments (The orphanage/insane asylum nearly made me♥♥♥♥♥♥myself).+ Memorable characters and how they talk... Pagans: ""Where bes that woodsy little beastie?""Stone creatures: ""Find and catch And Crush AND KILL AND CRUSH AND KILL!""Con's- The climbing boots/gloves.    What started out as a good idea and served its use in a select fiew parts of the game it overall seems to have been forgotten or abandoned by the dev's. When navigating the town going form mission to mission, I thought this item would open up new paths for exploration or give more shortcuts to save time traveling but it is largely ignored.There's one mission where you go break into a mansion on an island an one of those paths you can use is climbing the front building's wall and entering through the balcony via use of climbing gear. That is the only use I have seen for this expensive item (Oh yeah, you have to buy this nonsense).    I was luck enough to play this before Thief 2. A lot of people see this sequal as a bad game and/or comlain that you no longer have a sword to defend yourself and are given a pissy butter-knife. That is kind of a moot complaint, a theif should be light on their feet. They don't need extra weight holding them back.     The game's over-world/HUB town was interesting in an era were game environments were becomming more ""open-world"" or ""sandbox"" but now as I look back, I would have prevered to just jump into the next level like in the previous games. Conclusion: I recommend this game for was it is, a solid experience.Note: I don't know if Thief 3's multi-core processor crash has been patched. If not, hit Ctrl+Shift+Esc to bring up Task Manager, and under process right-click the game's executable and set affinity to 1 or 0 (making the game run on only one processor).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I pretty much recommend this game to everyone who likes stealth games. The Thief series has always been one of my favorites in the stealth genre. Garrett is an amusing character to follow. Graphic wise, it's pretty nice to look at, even though the women are rendered kinda scarily. But graphics don't really matter for a game anyway. It's an interesting take on a stealth game, and the story is actually pretty interesting and builds off of previous games. But you don't have to have played the previous ones to really understand this one, it just makes mention of events that happened in the previous games. So hopefully if you play this one, you'll want to play the others.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is interesting. I've played the past thief games and personally I perfer thief 2. Thief: Deadly Shadows (Thief 3) is interesting in it's own way. For one the graphics seem better (if you're into that kind of thing), the stealth is also polished, and even deeper. Sadly, for some reason I feel like something is missing! The voice actor is sadly bad in my opinion, his voice sounds a bit mouthy, but that is just me. Also the location's on the map usually highlight to show your location in the past thief games, in this one to me it doesn't. It doesn't show where I am, so it's basically useless. You'd have better luck attempting to draw the map out yourself! Other that that, Thief: Deadly Shadows is worth at least a play through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thief series of games are the most memorable games of my life and even enfluenced my life as a troubled teenager.  I've played them since 1999 starting with thief the dark project.   Deadly Shadows still maintains the best immersion i've ever experienced in a game and is an excellent follow-up to the thief series.     Thief Deadly Shadows includes what I consider one of gaming's most scariest levels.  I've never been terrified like this while playing any other game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An amazing title you should not pass up. Very atmospheric.Quite lengthy, too. Lots of fun things to do. In-between missions (After the tutorial level and the mission after that.) you can explore parts of the city and complete side-quests and find secrets, and just screw around, all with amazing atmosphere. What I did was I gave myself a ton of money with Cheat Engine so I could screw around with the game's wide array of items. One of my favorite things to do is to use Oil flasks to watch people slip in a slap-stick Home Alone movie manner.Good fun.I also like the implimentation of the wall-hug. Only thing missing is Rope Arrows, the climbing gloves are pretty awesome though. Spidermaaaan spidermaaaan got his powers stolen by garrett's haaaand.They're also kinda glitchy. Yeah this game has some strange bugs and glitches. On rare occasions in certain areas, when climbing onto a ledge you could fall through the world. Occasionally, Garrett levitates due to a glitchy jumping system which is easily fixed by equipting the bow and arrow (any kind of arrow), clicking left mouse to hold the arrow, and then cancelling the shot with the space bar. You could also tap the mouse button to quickly do this.Oh and Garrett can't swim anymore. Not that there's much water in the game anyway...I really like how the skybox has these cartoonish silhouette buildings with yellow boxes representing lit windows. Very well done. Really amazing atmosphere. That reminds me, the lighting engine kicks♥♥♥♥♥ Shadow volumes for the win. They don't have the blurry pixelation issue that more modern games have when it comes to lighting... New games have shadow resolutions... and they can be highly intensive... They also seem to have striping issues. Some people who play skyrim have striping issues with the shadows in that game.Shadow Volumes need to be brought back into gaming. They could be used to create a sun ray effect, aswell.(Because shadow volumes is basically a method of extruding some polygons and anything within the bounds has their illumination set to a low amount to create a shadow, why not use those extra polygons instead of using them merely to emulate shadows? Emulating Shadows AND volumetric lighting would be killing two birds with one stone.I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and I hope you will too.If only it wasn't planned for a multi-platform release... Imagine what the game could have been.There were some amazing parts in the game like the Thieves highway in Old Quarter. Imagine a massive city with a thieves highway creating a shortcut. The vision feels so ahead of time in my opinion.I could just imagine what the game would have been like if it didn't have to develop around the Classic Xbox's limitations. I mean some of the Xbox version's missions had to be shrinked...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfortunately, I've never played the first two titles and today the olden 3D graphics would probably turn me off. But ""Deadly Shadows"" pulled me in like only very few others. The whole game world is so dense, extremely well done and full of a very unique atmosphere that you're almost sad when you beat the game.Still the master of all stealth games.Oh, and the Orphanage level must be the creepiest place ever in a video game O_O9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
